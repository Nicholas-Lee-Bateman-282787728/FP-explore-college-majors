3557825,2,B001EXE2YC,"Conjurer (Clint Hutchison, 2008)

Mediocre haunted-farm flick you've probably seen a dozen times before. Young professional couple Shawn (Big Bad Wolf's Andrew Bowen) and Helen (Dangerous Curves' Maxine Bahns) Burnett need a break from the big city after Helen miscarries, so Helen's brother Frank Higgins (The Dukes of Hazzard's John Schneider) buys them some property out in the country and plans to build them a new house on the site of a Civil War-era shack that local legend has it is haunted by the ghost of a witch named Hattie. While they're waiting for the new house to get built, they're living in an older one on the property. Strange things start happening around the old cabin, but it doesn't seem like anyone but Shawn notices them. Of course.

Hutchison, whose previous directorial work consists of one short and a piece of the laughably silly horror anthology Terror Tract, takes this film down well-worn horror-trope paths without ever once veering off into new or interesting material; every piece of ham-handed foreshadowing we see is bound to lead exactly where you think it will. Having a female lead who can't act her way out of a paper bag doesn't help matters, either. On the upside, the film is reasonably well shot, and Bowen is convincing as a guy who doesn't know whether he's haunted or just crazy. Maybe worth renting if you have an hour and a half to kill and there's nothing else that looks appealing at the video store, but not all that hot. **",1228521600,,1477,4.765625
3557826,5,B001EXE2YC,"I was pleasantly surprised with this film. I've seen many horror/suspense films loaded with cheap scares and boring dialogue. This is NOT the case with Conjurer. This film delivers excellent dialogue and achieves scares that other films try but fail to do. This film sets a psychologically thrilling tone throughout the movie which ultimately creates the eerie suspense. It was artistically done, not the slashing or blood & guts. Conjurer succeeds with an actual storyline, great direction, actors and the LOCATION IS SPOOKY : )",1227484800,11,529,5.235294117647059
3557827,3,B001EXE2YC,"Nothing particularly new or original but still entertaining. I enjoy stories about witches because they haven't been done as much as zombies,vampires,possession,etc. You could do worse.",1521590400,,185,6.153846153846154
3557828,3,B001EXE2YC,"From the first scene, I disliked the main character. The movie was fine but when you dislike the main character you have trouble liking the movie. I'm glad he ended up where he did. He should have, from the first half of the movie. A kid comes to his brother in law's property, he has a hissy fit; a crow is in the property (where the crow was probably born) he has a hissy fit. He has hissy fits about the next door neighbor, his brother in law (who is supporting him and his wife; bought a property for them; who is planning on building them a house; and is letting them stay in the house in his property), etc. Plus, this is one of those actors who for some reason can NOT keep his mouth from being open ALL the time, which drove me to the edge of insanity. Some people think it's a great movie, I could have without the main character.",1521504000,,839,4.121951219512195

3557832,1,B001EXE2YC,"Doesn't bring anything new to the haunted house genre. Maxine Bahns plays the wife and she's just never been a good actress. The actor who plays the husband is better, but it's just not a very interesting plotline and didn't scare me at all. Boring.",1520553600,,249,4.555555555555555
3557833,3,B001EXE2YC,"What a bummer. I was really liking this movie. The actors, the suspense, the scary moments throughout the movie were great and I couldn't wait to see how it ended. And, then, the last 10 minutes occurred and it was as though the creativity ran out and someone said, ""Hurry up, finish the story with anything."" The last scene was SO DISAPPOINTING. Bummer.",1520467200,,354,4.634920634920635
3557834,4,B001EXE2YC,"Suspenseful and well-paced enough to keep me interested throughout. I think the brother of the main actress was on ""Dukes of Hazzard"". Although it does not offer anything unique to the genre it is still worth watching IMO.",1520294400,2,222,4.868421052631579
3557835,3,B001EXE2YC,Story was extremely eerie at times. The story was well written and well told. Kind of a twist on other stories like this. In most instances the wife or girlfriend would be the one having all the scary stuff happening to them. Ending was kinda weak and weird.,1520035200,,258,4.395833333333333

3557838,4,B001EXE2YC,"This one had the saddest happy-ending ever! Well, until the end. It had a good double-twist-ending. It did have some cheesy moments, but the acting was decent and it was worth the watch.",1519344000,5,186,4.666666666666667

This concept has been beaten to death (and done much better) over the decades.  Too bad this isn't one of the ""better"" examples.",1519171200,,372,4.507462686567164

3557842,3,B001EXE2YC,"have an ending and still have  good movie!!!  ""Leave em wanting more!!"" is good for magicians and musicians.

This new trend of either found garbage, er, footage, or movies without a real ending is really beginning to get annoying!!

Imagine Regan in ""the Exorcist"" turning to the screen with a red devil's eye at the end.  You instantly take a classic and turn it into garbage.

It's not leaving the audience guessing. Well yeah, guessing why you were too lazy or cowardly to produce a real ending as a director!!!",1518739200,,515,4.666666666666667
3557843,5,B001EXE2YC,I got the conjurer cos I haven't seen John Schneider since Smallville. I've always thought he was a very good actor... So I gave this movie a try. And... I never thought about turning it off. So I can recommend watching it,1491091200,,222,4.309523809523809
3557844,2,B001EXE2YC,"Slow moving horror flick about a young couple from the city who move into a country house that is haunted by the spirit of a witch that years ago inhabited a small cabin on the property.  This starts off promisingly enough but pretty much goes nowhere slowly, creating a creepy atmosphere but never generating any actual thrills.",1478304000,,329,4.771929824561403

3557848,3,B001EXE2YC,"I bought this DVD only because it had John Schneider it.  John is normally in Hallmark type movies and movies that are family friendly.  Conjurer is pretty predictable if you watch these types of horror or paranormal films.  But if not for anything else, catch John Schneider's performance in this one.",1388448000,,302,4.882352941176471
3557849,5,B001EXE2YC,"A young couple moves into an old farmhouse, a year after losing their unborn child. Strange, unexplained events take place, seemingly having to do w/ an abandoned cabin on the property. CONJURER is an excellent supernatural thriller... I think. Its the sort of movie that could be about a curse / paranormal conspiracy, or a man driven by schizophrenic delusions. After watching it twice, I'm still split evenly on which type of film it is! The makers of CONJURER have done an expert job of balancing dark, magical images w/ paranoid thinking, and less-than-sane reactions on the part of the protagonist (Andrew Bowen). I was never quite sure whether he was being tormented by a sinister entity, or simply breaking away from reality. Though the epilogue hints at a possible answer, it could just be my own misinterpretation. I love movies that keep me guessing, and this one certainly fits the bill...",1368230400,3,901,4.934210526315789
3557850,4,B001EXE2YC,"I thought John Schneider would appear in this movie more than he did.  But the movie itself was really good.  The ending was surprising, and a little spooky.  I just wish John Schneider would appear in it more.  The part he played was a little out of character for him, but all in all it was a good movie.",1336435200,,305,4.11864406779661
3557851,5,B001EXE2YC,"My DVD movie arrived in excellent condition.  The price I paid at Amazon.com was extremely economical
considering the economic conditions we have now in the United States.  I would shop with Amazon.com
before paying higher prices at other locations.  The movie ""Conjuror"" kept you in suspense for the
entire movie.  The ending was slightly different from what I expected but overall I would recommend
this movie to all movie buffs.  ..............Sylvia Reid",1271894400,,458,5.305555555555555
3557852,4,B001EXE2YC,"With so many terrible horror films coming out, it's always surprising to see one that actually understands the genre. 'Conjurer' won't win any points for originality, but at least the makers of this film have learned a little about atmosphere and that less is more in some cases. The story of an couple who move to a remote farmhouse to heal after losing their unborn child is both chilling and pretty smart. The acting is above average, but that doesn't mean it is without its flaws. The usual ""get the H E L L out of here"" thoughts will scream through your head, but the doesn't make this film any less effective.

What I thought was really impressive is how the director could evoke chills in broad daylight! Clocking in at under an hour and a half, 'Conjurer' has enough chills to keep true horror fans happy and considering its short length doesn't fail to tell a complete story.",1261526400,2,884,4.559748427672956
3557853,4,B001EXE2YC,"I love Clint Hutchinson's work! He directed Terror Tract which I love the Granny killer, and now he takes this film to a higher level. The story was solid, rich, and creepy as hell. The cinematography was great!
The score was sound.  I would strongly recommend this movie to those who like psychological horror!",1260921600,,311,4.7592592592592595
3557854,5,B001EXE2YC,"Not quite just another horror movie. The Conjurer is about a man who keeps seeing images of a witch appar in his back yard shed. The people all around him including neighbors, the previous owners, and even his wifes brother all tell him ""those are just myths and stories people say to spark interest"". But the man continues going through strange occurrences and unexplainable events despite all this.

The story in the beginning is about the mans wife who lost her baby, and what happens when they move to a farm house in the country to start over.

What makes this movie 5 stars is quite simple- there's two major twists at the very end that will probably catch you by surprise, and the eerie build-up in the first half of the movie is quite fantastic when the man continues to see and hear things in the woods and in his shed that he can't explain. The plot builds slowly, but not TOO slow that you become bored with it. It requires a fair amount of your attention span, but it's totally worth it because of the ending. Without spoiling too much, what you probably think is going to happen to the wife is actually going to be something much different.

The writers of the film were also aware what's been done a million times in other horror stories and disregarded them, such as the scenes involving a little boy who kept spying on his new neighbors. There's an explaination for his appearance and it's good writing because he doesn't play the typical ""scary kid hiding in woods planning to kill people"" that it appears he's going to play when you first see him.

The acting is great all around, especially the wife who's very underrated in her performance.

I wish there were more horror movies like this out there. Ones that deliver on suspense, storytelling, and fantastic endings.",1253750400,6,1787,4.589341692789969
3557855,4,B001EXE2YC,"This film is what I was hoping ""An American Haunting"" would be more like, which I found to be disappointing after the hype. ""Conjurer"" is a lot creepier due to it's slow pace build-up in telling a quality witch story, and not so much reliance on special effects like ""American Haunting"". This is definitely worth at least a rental and a good little fright film to watch on Halloween. Not the last word in scary films but not bad, either.",1252886400,,437,4.475
3557856,5,B001EXE2YC,"I give this a thumbs up ! I thought all the acting was great with a great cast. The cover gave me a feeling that I would not be disappointed. I love John Schneider and the fact that he was cast was another reason I decided to purchase this movie. I love horror, suspense and an all around thriller, I felt this one fit all of these categories. I would reccomend it to anyone that likes a good scary flick, not too much gore and with a good ending. Too many of today's movies are good until you get to the ending and you wonder what just happened !!",1251158400,3,548,4.036697247706422
8299789,1,B001EXE2YC,"This movie had a cast of good actors, but the story seemed so cheesy.  It had a decent amount of suspense, but the lead male character seemed to be genuinely stupid.

8299795,3,B001EXE2YC,"As others have said, the movie doesn't bring anything particularly new to the genre - I don't watch much in this genre, but I could predict the major plot points along the way. But the story is enjoyable, and a bit tragic, in its portrayal of a happy and loving couple moving to the country for some R&R. I enjoyed the bits of visual suspense and trickery, and how we see reality unwinding for one of the characters. The acting was decent, other than the scene with the crow and the dog. That was the worst prop... lol",1523318400,,518,4.295918367346939
8299796,4,B001EXE2YC,"I would have given this film 2.5 - 3 stars since I place it just about there on the scale, noticably below last years exceptional horror flick, Get Out (a favorite which earned 5 stars [easily] in my book). So why did I give Conjurer extra points? Well, the story was interesting, it was nicely filmed, it was genuinely spooky. So many movies of this genre nowadays are dim, dark, depressing to follow. This one had its bright spots, lovely countryside exteriors, pleasant to watch even though it was a scary story. Conjurer did keep me on the edge of my seat. Oh, and one of my favorite actors from my youth (John Schneider) was convincing as the pragmatic brother Frank and quite easy on the eyes too!",1521936000,,703,4.5
8299797,4,B001EXE2YC,This movie shows how much can be done well with a small budget. Anyone reading this review already knows the movie is about a haunted house. The best and most ingenuous part is the interaction of the hero with the environs in and around the house. Worth your time if you like horror movies.,1521849600,,290,4.388888888888889
