But I've had several episodes that won't play properly. They'll start in the middle or later. Plus, the disc with the last 2 episodes of the series won't play at all.

2860331,4,B000R7I43Q,"Watching the shows, again, with no commercials is wonderful.  I followed a portion of the series when it originally aired and was happy to find the Complete Series on DVD.  Based on the picture shown at the time, I believed I was ordering the Limited Deluxe Edition, but the edition with the cardboard sleeves is what arrived.

While the Series is awesome, the packaging of the DVDs was not well thought-out.  Upon arrival, I ran all the DVDs through the Player and was happy to have no defective discs, despite that almost all the DVDs arrived scratched to some degree due to the packaging.  I bought a Case Logic CD/DVDW-64 Wallet ($14) from Amazon to hold all the discs, as returning the discs to the cardboard sleeves in the book would scratch them even more.

The Book of Shadows replica, with only the written pages, would have been nice to keep but the empty cardboard pages prevented the book from laying in an open position and impossible to read.  I eventually tossed the Book in the trash.

The DVDs are well worth the price paid.",1504742400,,1041,4.589189189189189

2860343,1,B000R7I43Q,"got into the show because mylady wanted me to watch it with her.
i have seen other show like this one (eg buffy, sliders, and others ) and have enjoyed them.

BUT

charmed is NOT, in anyway, good.

it toke me 4 seasons to understand how i could best describe how bad it is (meaning why it is bad , imo)

here it is:

it's a scify supernatural show that feels like it's been made, designed , directed , acted , by sitcom professionals.

the acting is not bad , definitely not stellar , but the direction of actors is very *very* bad.

the casting is wasp: there is that one black dude , and those one or two episodes with asians , the rest is white washed from hair to teeth.

the stories are not bad , and they are definitely NOT good, they just feel like a bad sitcom show from early 80s.
There are story arcs but they are also bad , plus they feel like added ontop of stories , in such a way that the ""charmed universe"" *never* feels right, whole, and real , like say the buffyverse , or the sliders' verse.

The one liners are just so bad it made me puke, just look at the episode title list to get an idea :""a knight to remember"" , ""a Paige from the past"" , ""malice in wonderland""
bad puns all the way

The special effects are technicaly ok , but their artistic value are sub zero , which makes them bad.

the fight scenes are so bad i feel sorry for the stunt doubles and stunt choregrapher.who have to reveal they worked on the show (i know i wouldn't)

the music feels from the 80's in a bad bad way: the music underlines the mood of the scenes in a so blatent way it's insulting to the audience.. (apart maybe the two or three episodes in the past , where it felt realy good : in those episodes the music used to underline the era not the mood/atmosphere)

the set design, lighting, camera placement , feels like a sitcom. Once in a long while there is one good shot : they are so rare that you actually notice them, as opposed to shows where you only notice the few bad shots.

the only reason i watched it till the end is for the fan service(50%) and mylady(50%). it is after all three beautiful woman that expose so much skin it's just blatently to keep guys watching. , plus there are episode dedicated to guys (that superhero show called ""witches in tights""  (yeah you read that correctly, and it is exactly what you think)

the wardrobe/costumes are disgusting, once in a while you see a nice evening dress , the rest of the time, its young women that dress like teenagers with no taste whatoever. (and of course one size too small to make sure we don't miss the booooobs"")

women's makeup feels like product placement , but from time to time, they actually look good, rarely, but it does happen.

the ""monsters"" are paint on body: face for males , belly and cleavage for females.

the props are laughable
the daggers / swords actually look like toys
the infamous Book of Shadows looks ridiculous : its page design is clearly late century in its fromat (wide margins and footers/headers), and the writing looks stupid within context : witches as they are depicted within the universe would not do manastery-like illuminations , plus when we go back in time it is clearly stated that knowledge is passed down by voice , not writings. , And when we see phoebe actually using a whiteboard marker to add info into the book it desecrates the book and what it is meant to represent.

apart from the bellybuttons and cleaveage you get to see ( a lot, thankfuly ) there is nothing worth mentioning about this show.

all in all :
bad writing , (characters are not in anyway believable , and are rough stereotypes, they do eveolve though, from one stereotype to another.)
bad production design (character , wardrobes, set design, sfx design, props , fight scenes, whatever you see or hear on this show , nothing and i mean *nothing* looks good)
direction of actors : sitcom-like ; which feels very bad withing context (the actors do seem to be ok but they are handed such poor material and environement , you can't blame them for looking bad)

do yourself a favor do NOT think in any way that this show is quality television , it's not  , it feels like an early 80's sitcom show.
To give you a measure, the black and white adams family tv show is much better , althoug several decades older.

it's barely entertaining , and the stories are so rarely good , i could count the number of good episodes on one hand , out of 180.

thank god for the fan service , i could not have gone through the the whole thing without it.",1504483200,,4523,4.305424528301887

A few of the discs were stuck by a bit of glue that holds the pages together as others have mentioned.

Unless you leave yours somewhere hot for prolonged periods of time (like say when they ship it to you) you shouldn't have any problems with it.

The packaging is horrendous.  EVERY disc was damaged due to the cardboard disc holding slots.  Removing the discs from their slots leaves glued on pieces of the cardboard/paper on the underneath of the disc.  While this can be carefully scratched off, the chances of the disc having read errors is 100% guaranteed.  And on top of this, several of the discs were simply bad pressings and refused to load at all.  Any disc that did load had at least one of the episodes with unrecoverable glitches.  If you want the book edition of this complete series only get the Deluxe Limited Edition version that has foam core holders for the discs.  I think even the discs in the 2014 complete series edition in the plastic cases would arrive in playable condition even with the likelihood that the discs weren't properly secured and slid around causing scratches.",1494115200,,1022,4.659217877094972

I was hesitate at first after reading some negative reviews about the packaging of the DVDs and in one customer's situation, receiving the wrong collection but I am completely happy with the product I got. It is absolutely stunning with replica pages that you can actually flip through from the beautifully designed Book of Shadows represented on the show and this version of the collection uses the sleeves for the DVDs rather than the previous setup I've heard complaints about which led to DVD scratches. I am also so happy to hear the actual theme song of the show again after suffering through re-watches on Netflix. I haven't completely gotten through my marathon yet but I'm assuming that all of the promotion music is there as well. I'm a little disappointed that there's no Shannen Doherty talking heads on the bonus features though. I understand she left on bad terms but there has to be some behind the scenes or interview footage that they could have included. Though maybe there is something on one of the discs; I am after-all still making my way through it and will edit this review if anything changes on that front.

I already owned each season individually but wanted to buy this box set to have it signed by Holly Marie Combs when I meet her later this month. I was fully satisfied with this product until 1. When I went to insert disc 4 of season 6, it was no where to be found (I had just opened the box moments before) and 2. Disc 6 of season 6 was clearly from the packaging of the single season edition of season 6 for it was red unlike all of the other silver discs included in this package. The playback is fine, the packaging is in new condition but the manufacturing was clearly haphazardly completed and overall leaves me with a sketchy vibe.",1476230400,4,701,4.2

Was very excited to buy the whole series now that I'm back in the States. For the most part, I'm pleased. HOWEVER, there are at least two episodes where the soundtrack is off by a second or two -- it's like watching an old-time, dubbed Japanese monster movie! Really annoying, and really surprising that that low quality was released!

Additionally, very much to my dismay, discovered that there is no Season 1, Disc 5 in the box! It was mis-packed and there are TWO Season #2, Disc 5s. By the time we got to Disc 5, we decided it wasn't worth returning and/or exchanging and having to wait. VERY disappointing!",1462492800,2,716,4.465648854961832

2860660,5,B000R7I43Q,"Giving this 5 stars for the quality of the series, I absolutely loved it!!!  If I were rating the quality of the dvd's, I'm afraid it would be 1 star.  It's not made for wide screens, so it's a bit disturbing to see Alyssa Milano look that wide.  And the quality of the picture is very grainy, especially the darker scenes. And last but not least, there are absolutely no extras. Although I've seen worse, the packaging leaves something to be desired.  Overall, it's a ""NO FRILLS"" set, but it is priced as such.

But back to why I rated it 5 stars.  Even though I was disapointed in the quality of the set, I was thrilled with the series, and would still recomend it!!!  It has just the right combination of fantasy, family, action, drama, and even comedy.  It's nice to see a primarily female cast carry such a good series.  You have 3 ""good"" witches (The Charmed Ones)  battling all sorts of evil, from demons to warlocks, each having their own unique powers.  During the course of the eight seasons you will see fairies, gremlins, leprechauns, cupid, nymphs, ghosts, wizzards, werewolfs, vampires, genies, angels, sorcerers, warlocks, evil witches, a wide variety of demons, time travel, and other dementions.  It's one of the best good vs evil shows I've ever seen.  There is some gore, so it's not really a kids show, but it doesn't depend on the gore for the thrills.  If you liked shows like X-Files, Fringe, 4400, and Warehouse 13, I think you will like this spin on the supernatural.",1461369600,,1492,4.6022727272727275

It is heavy and well made with gold colored edges. The DVDs are better protected too because they snap into the book and do not get scratched up due to the sliding in the small edition. I own both boxsets so I can confidently tell you the differences. The content itself artwork wise and DVD wise are exactly the same. If you are lucky enough to find one for sale get it before its sold as this is a highly sought after edition! Very rare. I highly recommend this edition.",1458691200,14,608,4.342105263157895

For the price I believe this is an excellent buy since according to the box, there are 48 discs in this boxed set which is nicely packaged. I did not open the set since it is a gift but they are divided into 2 other cases inside the cover case. At the price I paid, it works out to around $1.25 per disc, which is an excellent value.",1457740800,,471,4.075268817204301

I think she was regretting the sale so I wanted to surprise her with them again.  She tells me she likes this better then the individual seasons - in fact I wouldn't mind having the complete set such as this one.  They work well for her and I have heard no complaints.
If you haven't seen this series then I would suggest it.  I was sad to see it go off television, but at least they gave it closure on the last one.  The show starts with 3 sisters learning they are witches...  There is times you will laugh, times you might cry.  there is romance.  there is babies.

My boyfriend had to fix them by pushing the paper up inside the cardboard like it is supposed to be and super glued it. The paper pushed down inside then had caused slight scratches on the brand-new dvds. Also a page came bent badly almost halfway up from the bottom.

I borrow a copy from my friend to rewatch since I didn't get the chance to watch from the beginning to end. I just got hooked to it and decide to get a copy for myself. However, I was just starting to watch disc 1, I dislike how it goes to main menu after each episode end. It can't play all episodes and it does not have subtitle (only season 8 have subtitle). This collection is the one that comes in 2 big volumes (4 seasons in each), each case holds 24 discs. There is only few special features which is unlike the deluxe version (I think) or the bundle set (individual seasons). Of course, if you want more special feature, you have to purchase the deluxe version or buy each season (bundle set is not available unless third party) if you don't mind about the price or going back to the main menu after each episode. If you don't care about the special feature and subtitle, I prefer this version (price is the main reason).

I personally want the deluxe version because of the design but too much people complained about disc having glue and of course the price as well.",1445731200,5,1165,4.344036697247707

2860824,5,B000R7I43Q,"The disks are crammed into giant DVD cases, which split the whole series into two giant volumes, seasons 1-4 in one case and 5-8 in the second case. The physical material itself won't win any awards for artistic presentation or durability, but jeez, how often are you gonna be watching this series anyway?

The DVD software is good and runs simply and smoothly. But the main reason this was purchased was for the music licensing. The Netflix version has nearly every song in the entire series changed, from the title music to all of the intro background musics and even down to the accompaniment in the middle of the episodes. And the new songs weren't anywhere near as good as the real ones. With this box set, Prue's funeral was perfect once again. The intro BGM for when the Avatars changed the world (Switchfoot's ""This Is Your Life"") fit into place, etc.

And now to push our way through the drudgery that is season 8...

Honestly, it should have ended at 7. But then again, the comics are still going on, so, well...",1444694400,6,1022,4.573770491803279

2860913,4,B000R7I43Q,"Clearly this is not the ""Book Of Shadows"" DVD version (even tho the reviews here were for that item) but this version is a welcome treat. I've been a Charmed fan since it's debut, and even tho I already have all original 8 seasons on DVD (when they would release separately), I always wanted a box set that had all the seasons in one big bundle. And this release delivered on that promise. Not to mention the box art work is cool too (I love how they blended the sisters and put the two most powerful incantations they used on the plastic). My only cons about this Charmed release are the previews are still there on Seasons one and two beginning DVDs. But hey, I guess Paramount/CBS/Spelling Entertainment have to  get their coin too. And I wish they had used a darker color for the font on the DVDs because the silver on top of light gray is hard to read. A red, brown or black would have been nice. Otherwise, I like that each ep title is printed on the DVDs. And if you're looking for the power of 3 all together in one, this is the Charmed set to get.",1436054400,3,1056,4.227722772277228

2860951,5,B000R7I43Q,"According to my purchase profile (Medicine books basically) Amazon must have guessed I am a Physician, being that said, Amazon might be questioning why a Physician would be buying a series like that. Well, if we go to TV series, they will see I also bought Miami Vice (and I did not buy House). So the question remains, why did I buy Charmed. Well, it was, initially bought in order to be a gift to someone, and it ended up being a gift. But then, I began to watch the series, at first, because of that beautiful siamese cat (Kit the cat). It happens I was also a cat breeder in the past, and I had a beautiful Siamese Seal Lynx Point (she passed away when she was 12 y.o.). That cat was awarded a Supreme Grand Champion Status in TICA. Well then, I began to see that the series is about the fight of good x evil, and that in this sense it is really an action series. I did not expect this. ""Demons"" group just like real gangs of bandits and the Charmed ones fight them boldly. It began to show some resemblance to an action series, magnified by the beauty of the actresses and of the cat.

2861012,3,B000R7I43Q,"To start off, I am a huge fan of the ""Charmed"" series. I originally started watching the series on DVD shortly after it's 8 season run on the WB. From 2005 through 2007, each individual season of ""Charmed"" was released on DVD. I started watching the show and I became hooked rather quickly - once I was done with one season, I headed back to the store to purchase the next. This was at a time when most retailers were still carrying all of the seasons in store. It didn't take me long to finish viewing the show & shortly thereafter, it was announced that the complete series would be released in 2008 across 2 editions; the complete series & the complete series (limited deluxe edition). Being that I'm such a super-fan, I had to get my hands on both sets for collecting purposes - also because the complete series sets were housed in your very own 'Book of Shadows'; the limited deluxe edition being the actual size of the 'Book of Shadows' you saw on screen. For hardcore fans, I would recommend getting at least one of the 'Book of Shadows' sets. The smaller-sized version currently retails for approx. $100 and the limited deluxe version (which comes with extra 'Book of Shadows' pages & an exclusive special features disc including the original unaired pilot with then-Phoebe castmember Lori Rom) is extremely difficult to locate these days. If you were to find a limited deluxe edition, you may be spending upwards of $500-$800 due to its rarity. Both of these versions are currently out of print although most retailers are currently selling the remainder of their stock of the smaller-sized 'Book of Shadows', hence the reason for this release at the tail-end of 2014. If you're addicted to the Power of Three like myself and you want something to remember the show by, spring for a 'Book of Shadows' version. You won't regret it. Decide which you can afford or if you can find the limited deluxe edition, get it. It's absolutely gorgeous and beautifully constructed. I haven't seen anything as beautiful in any other release ever - it's such a treat for us fans. I would consider it to be the gem of my collection.
Overall, I'm not only extremely versed in the series itself, but also the DVD releases being that I've purchased each incarnation. Having said that, this release (which I also own) was purchased by me out of pure curiosity more than anything else. For casual fans of the series, this is a great way to watch & save some money. All 8 seasons are housed in shelf-friendly packaging and if this is going to be your first time buying the show on DVD, I would go with this option over purchasing the series season by season. It's put together as a mostly generic & economic response to the other complete series sets that were released and doesn't break the bank. The drawback? This release sees very little in the way of artwork - in terms of packaging and the DVD's. None of the DVD discs have artwork on them, unlike each of the other releases. The discs do have the episode titles displayed on each, which is not the case in previous releases. Special features wise, you are getting the same set of extras that were included with 'The Final Season' release in 2007; roughly 5hrs of additional content if you include the few episode commentaries they did. Each seasons' episode list is displayed on the inside jacket sleeve - but without an episode synopsis or any info pertaining to the episodes' original airdate on the WB. Seasons 1-4 are together in one large plastic bookcase; seasons 5-8 in the other. One unique aspect of this release is in the form of the outside box package. All the sisters (including Shannen Doherty) are featured in a photo collage on the front & back -- its obvious that they have photoshopped Shannen Doherty's character Prue into the images. From a collectors standpoint, it's rather cool to see a release that features all of the actresses (Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan & Shannen Doherty) in one photo - because as we know, this never happened on screen.
This release is also great in terms of travel. I don't like to shuffle around the individual seasons or the large 'Book of Shadows' while on trips -- this current release allows you to watch without worrying about ruining any crucial packaging or accidentally damaging a disc, as this release doesn't have any bells & whistles and could easily be replaced by purchasing another for under $70 if need be. Nothing overly amazing or consistently unique about this recent release, but perfect for continued use and for the casual fan just now watching the series and/or wanting to experience it again. I'm sure you'll enjoy watching ""Charmed"" on DVD for years to come, just as I have.",1430179200,4,4709,4.681544028950543

Some of the series is really goofy and campy, some are not badly done.  What has dawned on me that I forgot about was the clothing.  I was never clear why two out of the three dressed like poor hookers and almost every show nipples were the main focus?  I thought only a few of the main actors could act, the rest you wonder how they even got acting jobs.

2861199,4,B000R7I43Q,I think the series is a very good one. My only problem with this is the fact that there are no subtitles. At least not in the first four seasons.

2861222,1,B000R7I43Q,"The reason I give this such a poor review is due to the fact that the product I received was not the same product as advertised in the photos on the Amazon web site. Before I made my purchase, I researched this product and was well aware of the problems associated with the ""sleeved"" design version of the Book of Shadows. The photos on the web site clearly show the Book of Shadows holding 3 dvds per page attached by the center hole of the discs which is the preferred design. This design eliminates scratching the discs as they are removed and inserted into the chipboard sleeves but most importantly it eliminates the notorious glue problem associated with the sleeved version. Well, guess what? I received the sleeved version and all the problems associated with it!
This Book of Shadows holds 2 dvds per page in too tight chipboard sleeves that you almost can't help but scratching getting them in and out! One sleeve for season 6 was defective with the inner liner not attached or glued properly. Speaking of glue, seems like it is hit or miss with this product. 17 of my discs were defective with glue/adhesive on the playing side!
I purchased this as a Christmas gift and am very disappointed. Sending it back for a refund.",1418688000,9,1232,4.6045454545454545
2861223,5,B000R7I43Q,"Being a big Charmed fan, I absolutely am in love with this product. It looks like their Book of Shadows and even has pages identical to the book. I read some reviews where people weren't happy with the DVD's because they wouldn't play or had glue on them, but I didn't have that problem. Mine came in pockets and weren't glued to the pages. I think it's an amazing collector's item for a Charmed fan to have. I also love that it has a bonus DVD with special features.",1418688000,,467,4.258426966292135
2861224,5,B000R7I43Q,"I don't have this copy, I have the Book of Shadows copy.  Amazon tends to lump different versions of the same product in together.  I saw this new version on Amazon shortly after I ordered the Book of Shadows box in November.  I took a chance on the Book because I had all the individual seasons, so as long as the bonus disc worked I would be okay because I could replace any defective discs.

I have watched nearly the entire series since purchasing the BOS set and I've had no issues with glue on any of the discs.  I really like the artwork on the cover of the BOS set, but I am very much loving this new cover where they've phased Prue in with the other sisters.  It will probably also fit better than the book if you have limited space storage, and if you don't want to risk getting bad discs in the BOS set (I guess I got lucky), then this is probably the set to go with.  One thing I am not certain of with the new boxed set is the music licensing.  The original individual season sets have all the original music and the Charmed theme, except Season Eight which has all the original music but not the theme because the licensing ran out shortly before the Eighth Season came to DVD.  However, if you watch the series on Netflix NONE of the eight seasons have the theme song and some of the music in many episodes has been changed.  For me, having the theme song is part of watching an episode of Charmed, so again I'm glad I got a good copy of the Book of Shadows set.

Content-wise, Charmed holds up after all these years.  I've read some reviews and comments where people are asking why this wasn't remastered in HD if they were repackaging the complete series into a better boxed set.  For those with that question, go Google the HD remastering efforts for Buffy and you'll see why it's better they leave Charmed alone.  Watching the series brings back the feel of the late 90s to mid 2000s.  I've purchased series sets of other shows I used to love and I just don't get the same feeling from them.  I can watch a few episodes of Charmed today and feel the same way I felt about it ten years ago.",1418601600,3,2108,4.2325
2861225,4,B000R7I43Q,"In case anyone wants to know what the set looks like, here you go. I took these when I received the set. Ignore the grossly incorrect date! :) Overall, I think for the money it is a great set. Yes, it is missing the bonus disc from the previous Complete series, but that is ok. While I would have liked individual cases  for each season and disc art, I do think the studio tried somewhat to give fans something different. I love the color scheme and the mash-up of Prue and the other sisters in the set. Good release!",1418342400,48,517,4.222222222222222

2861233,5,B000R7I43Q,I bought this set and I love it. Its SO MUCH better then the book of shadows set that was released a few years earlier.

2861236,4,B000R7I43Q,"I absolutely love this show.  The box set is made up just like their book of shadows.  The reason I only give it 4 stars, is because of a problem.

2861262,5,B000R7I43Q,"Charmed is a spellbinding series. During the first three seasons Shannen Doherty portrayed the headstrong eldest sister Prudence, Holly Marie Combs, Shannen Doherty's real life best friend, portrayed the neurotic middle sister Piper, and Alyssa Milano portrayed the free spirited youngest sister Phoebe. The first three seasons of Charmed are the show at its peak. During the first three seasons the show played to the actresses strengths. Shannen did the dramatics, Holly grounded the series with her mix of drama and sarcastic comedy, and Alyssa was comedy eye candy. The original cast had amazing chemistry. Charmed lost some of its charm after Shannen's departure but it was still a highly entertaining show. Rose's addition changed the show and it continued on for another five seasons, some of which vary in quality. This is must have any fan of the show.",1412985600,,861,5.1571428571428575

Even though it is not an exact replica in size to the actual Book of Shadows it is still a fun item to have if you're a Charmed fan.  The big downside to this item is the DVDs.  Unless they change the way they package the DVDs themselves I would not recommend buying it.  The DVDs are just placed in the sleeves and when I received them, probably during the travel of shipping, there were a lot of scratches and some had even come out of the sleeve.  I played all the DVDs and only 2 or 3 actually played all the way through. All the others just quit playing b/c of the scratches. I was pretty disappointed but I found some suggestions on trying to remove the scratches that might work but not sure I'll try it.  I didn't call to see if they would replace it only b/c I got a good deal.  I'll probably just start buying each individual season separately in their own individual dvd case. That's really the only way to make sure you have more of a chance getting one not scratched.  Hope this helps others",1409875200,,1069,4.231527093596059

However:

2. Many of the DVD's don't work!  There are glue issues from the packaging, and scratches.

I also wish to thank the people who did mention the glue on some of the discs, this has happend with mine as well.  I would have thought that years down the track from the first complaints that this issue would have been resolved.  I am talking about some of the complaints stemming from 2008 it is now 2014.  I cleaned all my discs with DVD Disc Cleaner.  The heavy glue substance did come off but marks have been left behind.  There also is stratches on some of the discs, I would say that this is from being pushed into the sleeves.  I have not played any discs yet, only received today, but I am hoping that none of the discs are damaged in any way and play without problems.  Also it was mentioned in at least one review about the gold edging around the Book of Shadows, mine does not have this.  I definitely have my fingers crossed, heres hoping for good viewing, no skipping or jumping discs.
24/9/14 - Additional Review to my Charmed Complete Series.  I have only Series 8 to watch.  I consider myself very lucky, given the reviews made by disappointed people, that I have had little or no problems.  I had a small break-up of picture in one movie on one disc in Series 1.  One small break in Series 3 in one disc in one movie.  Two small breaks in Series 6 in two movies, one at the very beginning of a movie and one at the very end of another movie, on the same disc.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase, though I must say that these problems, even thou mine very minor, should have been fixed-up long before 2014.
3/10/14 - Finished watching series 8 with no problems.  Considering there are 49 discs I feel that my faults on discs was minor.",1407888000,,1797,4.225806451612903

2861342,1,B000R7I43Q,"How did this show manage to stay on the air for so long? It's horrible. It's a show that takes the worse moments from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and throws it into a world of ""The Craft"". 3 Sisters find out one day they are witches and must become super heroes to save the day.

The acting is so cringe worthy. Shannon Daugherty was bad enough as an almost emotionless actor in Beverly Hills 90210, and she managed to play the exact same character in this. Just change the name around, but if Jason Priestly had have shown up on set playing her brother, I doubt any 90210 fans would have felt anything but happiness.

Alyssa Milano... yeah, guess why she was cast? An attempt to lure male viewers perhaps? Didn't work in the end. But she seems to be the only one who could do a half decent job of acting in this thing.

Then there is... what's her name? I don't know, nor do I care to find out... I think she plays Pippy or Piper or something? She has got to be the worst actress in Hollywood. I thought Shannon Daugherty was blunt, but man, there is a reason you have not seen this girl in anything worth a damn since this show finished. She is irritating, one dimensional, and did I mention she really can not act?

So they throw these 3 together, and not one of them looks like she could be the sister of the other 2. You know, sometimes sisters tend to have the same features somewhere? Whether it be eyes, nose, hair color, eye brows, ears or something? Hmmm... not a single similarity between any of them. I know, they are actors and not really sisters... but come on, they could have cast girls who sort of look like they could be related, couldn't they?

So, here is the #1 reason I can't stand this show. Because every week it seems to be the exact same thing. The girls are having some sort of problem or affair of their own, and try to rush around avoiding each other but reminding each other they are the power of 3 every chance they get. But that's when they have to come back together to fight this weeks bad guy. Of coarse, they can't figure out how to defeat the bad guy, so after consulting their own personal angel, they turn to a book of witch spells like it's something that they forgot existed until one remembers? Then they look through it for a vanquishing spell, which is never the same spell as last weeks, they lure a demon or something into their home, gather around the book and slowly say some stupid poem about how they are the power of 3 and they are compelling the demons, in a dull, boring, monotone voice, and then go have a happy go lucky cookie binge when the demon leaves in a puff of smoke.

Later on someone else replaces Daugherty, and she fits right into the house by reminding everyone that the power of 3 is this, and the power of 3 is that, and the power of 3 is blah, blah, blah.... if it wasn't annoying enough already at how many times they remind you they are the power of 3, they then go and open a bar called P3!!... guess what it stands for? Hearing them constantly say that made me wanna pull my hair out while my wife had this garbage playing every day, episode by episode, season by season. It reminded me why I saw a handful of episodes back in 1998 or whenever it started and never cared to watch it again.

I can't imagine anyone but girls into fantasy and probably want to be witches themselves would be into this show. Possibly also men not on the straight path too, but I will be surprised if any straight men watch this! This show was irritating, repetitive, and never seemed to go anywhere. Everything was always the same... one of the girls is away, only the power of 3 girls chanting some boring dull line can send Freddy back to Springwood, so you wait 15 more mins till the end of the show when the 3rd one finally gets there and reads from a book to vanquish an evil spirit sent from the seasons villain to try and get the charmed ones out of the way so he can not be stopped opening up another Star Bucks in the city.

And they have the nerve to charge over $100 for this? Even when it's on special for $75 it's a rip off. You only need 1 episode and you have seen what happens in every other episode. So what's a DVD worth? 50 cents? Postage? $2? Even paying $2.50 for this I would demand a refund.",1401235200,,4265,4.2245398773006135

Also, some of the earlier season DVD's have glue-like dots stuck on them, which I've got off somewhat, but 75% of the DVD's are good. If they all were damaged, I would return it, and the binding doesn't bother me, honestly. The rest of the product is great and I'm so excited to finally have the series!

2861347,2,B000R7I43Q,"May 11 2014 -
I bought all 8 seasons separately because of issues common with ""complete series"" packaging. But this seems the best place to review the entire series, rather than review each season separately.
I had watched about half the series on TV when broadcast,  but thought I'd like to re-watch it end-to-end since I was able to get all 8 seasons for about $15 per season. Doing so was a bit painful at times.
First, I am male, and I suspect that men and women will have substantially different reactions to the main characters.

Many/most of the story *IDEAS* are pretty good, but then it is like they turned the story *WRITING* over to a class of 8th graders.
For the most part, I would say the seasons with Shannen Dougherty are better than the seasons after.
I initially really disliked Julian McMahan as Cole, but he grew into the role and became maybe the most interesting character in the show until they wrote him out.
Plenty of skin to look at throughout the series, with the girls dressing like hookers or strippers most of the time. Nice to look at, especially Rose McGowan's wonderful alabaster skin, but it was not enough to make up for the juvenile script.
By far the most annoying character is Phoebe. I don't know how much that is Alyssa Milano and how much is pure Phoebe, but the character has the attention span of a knat and never seems to grow as a character, no matter how much dialog there is about her growing as a person in the script.  Season after season, they all whine about wanting a normal life. As if. And attempt after attempt to do so fails, but still there is no  change to the ""I don't have time to save the world right now because I need and deserve to be self-absorbed and self-indulgent"". They never seem to learn from the past, yet make a big deal about their ""experience"".
Overall, I am frustrated that over 8 seasons there has not been any substantial evolution in the ""feel"" of the episodes.
Maybe the intended audience was female ...
(I just started Season 8, so there may be some closing remarks to come.)

I finished the series and downgraded this show from 3 to 2 stars. I found, after subsequently watching 2 seasons of ""Hell On Wheels"", just how relatively bad ""Charmed"" is. Over 8 seasons, it had become like a soap opera -- the kind you get roped into it even if it is tripe.",1399766400,,2346,4.421296296296297
2861348,5,B000R7I43Q,Any true Charmed fan should definitely go for this version. It's a gorgeous version for any true fan. The work put into it is unreal and the disks are actually safe this way! Nothing like the cheaper version with clue all over the disks. Definitely recommend this,1399420800,4,263,4.617021276595745
2861349,5,B000R7I43Q,"I love having my own book of shadows.  I love everything about it, the best is no commericals.  I also love the fact they have commentaries about the show with the actors and the men that were apart of the series.  I just love all of it.

2861350,1,B000R7I43Q,"not all the episodes are featured.  Wherever there is a to be continued, the continuing episode is missing.  They are key episodes, the death of Prue, the final battle.  Made me regret not purchasing the seasons individually.",1398470400,9,225,5.027027027027027
2861351,5,B000R7I43Q,The series cover was a nice touch!!! I now own a copy of the Book of Shadows! It is very cool!,1398384000,,94,3.5238095238095237

2861356,5,B000R7I43Q,I have always loved this show! It is wonderful that this was in stock because I haven't been able to watch it on television because of bad connections lately but thankfully I now got my own complete series I can watch it without commercial interruptions and that is wonderful!,1397260800,,276,4.653061224489796
2861357,4,B000R7I43Q,"The series came when they said it would, and was packaged well.  There was a small cut in the binding, but otherwise was in excellent shape. I would buy from them again.",1397088000,,169,4.28125
2861358,5,B000R7I43Q,"This is one of the ultimate best TV series ever created.
I love watching as Prue, Piper, and Phoebe go through life having to hide the fact that they are witches with magical powers that they use to protect people.
I was highly impressed with the addition of Paige after Prue died. I honestly thought when I first heard about them adding someone new, that it would not live up to my expectations, but I was severely wrong. Rose McGowan did a superb job of creating a memorable character and giving the cast a fresh new taste of what can become of an offspring of a white lighter and a witch.
Furthermore, the decision of adding Chris in from the future and then giving a look to Wyatt as an adult was pure brilliance and genius. Wyatt and Chris are by far my most favorite characters of the entire series.",1396224000,,805,4.373333333333333

2861362,5,B000R7I43Q,"I LOVE CHARMED!! so of course I love this edition, however there is one disappointment. maybe two, I thought it would be more book of shadows pages then what is there, but its only maybe 15 pages out of 500! and my second disappointment is one of the spells is messed up!! it starts as the spell for them to get there powers and ends in the truth spell, I don't understand this typo and how no one has said anything about it before but I am saying it now! if you love charmed as I do, then this is PERFECT for you, if u know someone who loves charmed this is a perfect gift for them!!",1395705600,,584,4.0
2861363,5,B000R7I43Q,Thank you! Just what I wanted! I just love this series and am was so excited that I can get the whole set in one go instead of ordering one season at a time! Will order from again! A+++,1395446400,,185,3.769230769230769

2861366,3,B000R7I43Q,"I love the show, but the book was a bit cheap. I also found some gouges out of one of the discs and am watching it all before I decide whether to return it or just try to have the discs resurfaced.",1395014400,,197,3.7142857142857144
2861367,5,B000R7I43Q,"I purchased this item on 03/12/2014 and it arrived today, two days later after FedEx transferred it to the USPS.  So, on that front I'm going to say VERY impressed with the shipping on this.

I don't have to review the content, anyone who would be considering this purchase is already very familiar with 'Charmed.""

This is my second time purchasing this item.  The first time I purchased was when it was released in the fall of 2008.  I had several problems with discs and glue issues; luckily I never had to return the first copy because I had all the individual sets so I could just replace them on my own.  The set was ultimately stolen and I waited several years for the price to come down.  When I opened the set this morning I examined all 49 discs.  There is no scratching and no glue.  Obviously I've not had a chance to play all the discs but I did sample 3-4 discs per season just to verify they play.

After reading some of the other reviews, it appears that while the issue has been solved in many of the sets, some purchasers are still having problems.  I would still recommend this purchase.  Any individual discs that don't play can always be replaced.",1394755200,,1168,4.406542056074766
2861368,5,B000R7I43Q,"Charmed, hot chocolate, and a fire keep me sated on these polar vortex freezing days in New England. Great series, beautiful packaging.

In addition to the 'Book of Shadows'-look (size and weight included) inside you also get the book of shadows feeling since many pages from the actual book are included (handfasting, alchemist, belthazor, and many more).

But when I got the product, I found out that the only discs with subtitles were those of Season 8 and the Bouns disc, as it's indicated in the box. So I totally feel that Amazon lied to me, as the product box says exactly there would be no subtitles until season 8.

2861379,3,B000R7I43Q,"Real life size...not so much. Watch the show. The book is placed on a podium type thing and if you estimate the book size by that the book should be at least 2inches wider and at least 1-2 inches taller. I mean it's not even the size of printing paper... I mean that should really say something. I mean granted it maybe be smaller to keep the average dvd set price but seriously market it as replica not same size. I mean yes the actors were short but Leo was not and it was a decent size compared to him so that should give you some perspective.

The DVD's were kind of stuck to this thing inside the sleeves so make sure you remove them carefully or it will rip the pocket slot.

Other than that The pages were beautiful, the DVD's are all there. It's packaged nicely I guess.

Mine had cosmecitc issues with the front cover which lead me to believe it was used and resealed.",1392249600,,877,4.208333333333333

I love the commemorative book, i.e. packaging that the dvd's came in and the random art work through out the book portraying as if it were the ""real"" book of shadows as in the series.

Though the book is very well done and presented, the way the disks are stored in the paper holders damages the disks. They get scratched and glued upon and fail to work. Many jump and some fail to play. Although the aesthetics are nice and a lot of effort has gone into the appearance, practically the product is flawed.

Plus every time I do a search and actually click on the product the price starts to go up while I'm reading about it. I'd buy it if I knew for sure that the one I was ordering was the one the actual size of the Book of Shadows. I would be ticked if I got the mini. That just wouldn't be what I was expecting. And again, if the price would stay the same or go down to the $83 that I had originally saw it for. I've watched the price go from $83 to $113 in a matter of days when I had originally wanted to purchase it. Was about to buy it, but the price went up as I was reading the reviews.

2861453,5,B000R7I43Q,"So, I won't bother writing about how much I love the show itself. Just know - I love the characters and the story. The bonus features included are a must-watch for any Charmed fan. I especially enjoyed the history of the Book of Shadows and the unaired pilot. (Can you IMAGINE anyone other than Alyssa Milano playing Phoebe???)

I want to spend time on this box set - it's AMAZING. One of the most creative ways I've seen a series packaged. The ""Book"" is a great way to display the CDs and keep them altogether. I also like the way the stories are laid out, each episode described. The prop book is really cool. The cover is the worn-looking, heavy green binding with the Power of Three symbol, raised imprint on the front. The pages have clearly been manufactured (in other words, not the old-world paper, hand-inked) - but it doesn't take away from the campy fun. The reproduction pages are detailed and the artwork adds to the folklore and stories. There are 2 ribbon placeholders that you can slide into your favorite pages/episodes for quick reference.

If you plan to purchase all seasons, I strongly suggest you splurge and buy all at once. The price is reasonable - slightly cheaper than if you buy individual seasons over time. This would be a FANTASTIC gift if someone in your life loves the series. And if they haven't seen it, know the storyline would be loved by anyone that enjoyed supernatural shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, or Supernatural.

Very well done box set. It's so unique, I actually leave it out as a decoration and focal point. Enjoy!",1367971200,,1574,4.634408602150538

I hate the sub par packaging design CBS chose to use as almost half of my disks are damaged and unplayable, particularly seasons 6, 7, and 8. After doing some research, I see that this has been a problem since the release of the boxed set but CBS refuses to change the packaging. I wasted my money on an inferior product that I can't return as it's well past the time limit and I wasted my time watching incomplete episodes/disks.

I would have preferred to see the pages of the BOS with the seasons; for an example, when using the Baltazar spell, should be with season three, not later on. By keeping the pages/spells with each season would have been more realistic. I am extremely disappointing that a certificate of authenticity was not included; after all it is a ""special deluxe edition"" and you are paying enough for it.

2861474,4,B000R7I43Q,"On the surface, Charmed looks to be just another WB teen show. After all, the cast is loaded with former teen idols. Looks however can be deceiving! Charmed is a very solid mix of comedy and science fiction that leaves the fan craving more. I could sit and watch episodes of this show for hours!

Three sisters reunite for the funeral of the grandmother that raised them. After the funeral, they are going through the house and find a lot of things that lead them to believe their grandmother was into witch craft. After being attacked, investigating more, and being visited by some ghosts, the sisters learn that they are the decedents of a very powerful family of magicians. They are in fact legendary witches known as the charmed ones, who for thousands of years have been prophesized as the ones who finally tip the balance between good and evil to our side!

The show starts with them learning about their powers and ends with them trying to fulfill their destinies. Holly Marie Combes plays older sister Piper and while never the big name star of the show, she is by far the most interesting and entertaining character. Eventually the show comes to center around her and her family within the show. Personally, I think this is what saved the show after the early departure of one of its stars.

Charmed is eight seasons of magic, action, comedy, love, tragedy, and just plain fun. Being that it has a cast of all former teen idols, with low rating, on what is nowhere near a major network, the show didn't get the recognition that it deserved, but it is a terrific show! You can currently catch re-runs early mornings on TNT and of course watch it online. If you've got some time, I'd defiantly suggest checking it out!",1361577600,,1725,4.612377850162867

It is about 3 sisters who come to the realization that they are witches (the charmed ones).  The series comes packaged in a book which contains the DVDs and looks like the Book of Shadows from the series.  The book contains some of the spells and art work in the original book seen on the show.  There are 8 complete seasons and the stories and special affects are wonderful.

2861534,3,B000R7I43Q,"When I saw that the entire series of Charmed was being offered for 50.00 dollars I jumped at the deal! I was so excited. Charmed was and still is one of my absolute favorite shows and I had been waiting for a long time for the 8 season series to go on sale. And what a wonderful sale it was. Had everything gone smoothly after the purchase this would have most definitely been a 5 star review. Unfortunately it didn't. When the product arrived some of the discs were hanging half way out of their sleeve. I didn't really think anything of it because they weren't entirely loose. I gently slid them back in and placed the series collection on my shelf to watch at a later date. I have two jobs so I didn't get around to watching the show until about a month after it arrived.

The first two seasons went pretty smoothly. The 3rd and 4th (which I am currently on) did not go as smoothly. I have come across 5 discs (some that weren't hanging out when the series collection arrived) and almost every episode on those discs skips or pixelates or just freezes. I am really displeased with the way it was packaged. Just thinking about missing any more of my favorite episodes because of this annoys me to no end. I don't know if this is common or not but I urge you all to double check your disks in enough time to return the series for a replacement if they aren't packaged well. If I would have done that to begin with I wouldn't be looking all over the place for a disc cleaner/repair kit for the messed up discs. So because of the crappy packaging job I give this product 3 out of 5 stars. Here is to hoping none of the other discs mess up.",1357084800,,1638,4.2165605095541405

From a packaging perspective, I had zero problems with mine, all discs were flawless.  I have a few comments about the ease of sliding in the lower discs, but it was in superb condition.  The DVD case that is in the form of the book of spells is quite nice.  I think they did a great job in the look and construction of the book.  The cover is textured nicely, the pages with a somewhat antique feel and thick.  Each season's section starts out with graphics and a nicely done table of contents for each disc.  Personally, I would have preferred if each disc's table of contents were mirrored on the back of the previous page to the actual disc slot so it lines up with the actual disc that I open the book to for added convenience to reference with the disc I am pulling.  But overall, I thought it was styled very well, and constructed well.

Functionally speaking, I still prefer the normally sized DVD cases that fit on a media cabinet shelf along with all my other DVDs.  Being a completely different shape, it doesn't fit on a shelf that fits a usual DVD case.  I would prefer either a collection of slim-line case boxes for each season, or even better is a set of cases with the flip book style that even more compactly fits a complete season.  This is actually available, or if you purchase the seasons individually, but the older style that is out of production or individual seasons are more expensive.  So I still prefer the better value over function.

There were reports of issues by other reviews, that was reports of glue particles on some discs.  What I can say is mine was flawless, which I show in the video, and was sold by Amazon.  I recommend checking your discs within the Amazon return/exchange window in case yours has any issue.  I've never had a problem exchanging defective items for free by Amazon.

2861582,5,B000R7I43Q,"Addendum to the review. I am writing this on 3/1/2013:
I received great news as Paramount sent me the discs that had episodes not working. Many thanks to Paramount and the staff, who responded in a very efficient manner!!
I am now very satisfied.

Original review:

I purchased this on sale for roughly $49 (not including taxes, shipping).

I watched through all the episodes - took me nearly 3 weeks.

Here are the episodes that stalled/paused/skipped, or completely stopped playing:
Series 1, disc 4 - Is There a Woogy in the House
Series 2, disc 5 - Chick Flick
Series 2, disc 5 - Astral Monkey
Series 3, disc 1 - Magic Hour
Series 5, disc 3 - Y Tu Mummy Tambien
Series 5, disc 3 - Importance of Being Phoebe
Series 6, disc 1 - Valhalley of the Dolls
Series 6, disc 1 - Forget me...Not
Series 6, disc 3 - Chris-crossed
Series 6, disc 3 - Witchstock
Series 6, disc 5 - Crimes And Witch-Demeanors
Series 8, disc 2 - The Lost Picture Show
Series 8, disc 3 - Vaya Con Leo
Series 8, disc 3 - Mr. and Mrs. Witch

I have read a number of review in which other buyers were not happy with glue particles on the data side of the DVD.

I have tried cleaning it with toothpaste, and with cornstarch. It did help a couple of the episodes listed above run smoothly. But, given that these are supposedly new DVDs, I shouldn't have had to do that.

The big questions are:
1. Does anyone at Amazon read these reviews?
2. If they do, and they realize there is a problem with multiple discs containing glue particles, why don't they do something about it???

At $49, I'll just put up with it. I don't expect to buy all 8 seasons separately for this price, even in a few years more.

What a shame that the people who packaged this item chose to do it in a manner where the majority of DVDs have glue stains!!!!",1356220800,,1793,4.234604105571847

2861586,1,B000R7I43Q,"This review is about the PRODUCT, not the television show.

All I expect are playable DVDs. Nothing more.
I returned this item to Amazon TWICE due to defective manufacturing.

The first product received had a deep, hard, gouge in the first disc - unplayable. Every subsequent disc had a streak across it. Many discs, in fact most, were unreadable. Returned for replacement.

Second product I received had the first disc GLUED to the packaging and the packaging ripped removing the disc. I was willing to live with that, however..... Again, 95% of these discs are unreadable and all discs have a streak of residual glue or something across them. I attempted to clean several of the DVDs but no cleaning made them readable. I tried on 5 separate DVD players and most of the discs were simply unusable. Returned for a refund.

VERY poor mass-produced product. I'd strongly suggest staying away from this all-in-one series packaging. It's clear that the automated packaging treated the DVDs will little care and resulted in faulty dvds almost across the board. Perhaps it was simply a bad lot. However for $100+ I don't want to continually return a product just so I can get standard working DVDs.",1355616000,,1193,4.862068965517241

2861589,3,B000R7I43Q,"As a devoted Charmed fan, I was extremely ecstatic to be able to order this item as an early Christmas present for myself for only $49.99. After reading some of the reviews regarding glue being found on some of the DVD's, I did a bit more research and decided to treat myself and order the product. Once receiving it, I carefully inspected every DVD inside of the packaging and found several with small amounts of glue stuck on different areas. Using q-tips, a washcloth, rubbing alcohol, kleenix, and a bit of elbow grease, I was able to remove the glue rather effectively. After again looking through the DVD's, I noticed some markings on several of the DVD's, but passed them off. After getting through the first five seasons, I began watching the sixth season of Charmed. I was very disappointed to find that the first disk with some of the odd line markings (almost looking like smudges, but impossible to remove) was skipping and not playing some parts of the episodes all together. I carefully and thoroughly gave the smudged disks another cleaning and noticed a decent, but not great improvement. I am very upset with the way these disks were handled, and am wondering if it was worth it to buy the original Complete Series or if I should have saved up a bit more money to buy the more protected Charmed: The Complete Series - Limited Deluxe Edition. If anyone has any tips on how to clean these CD's a bit better, It'd be much appreciated!",1355356800,2,1448,4.616279069767442
2861590,2,B000R7I43Q,"These discs were all scratched and some had the glue stuck to them. I am worried about some of them working at all and since there are so many discs this will take a long time to see which ones don't work. I love the show, I just wish the book of shadows included more characters such as Tempest, The Triad, and Barbus, as well as the spider demon who cacoons her victims and then devoures them. For $92 I'm rather disappointed but if I had paid $50 it'd be ok. Who knows when I'll get to watch the episodes on the discs that look like they aren't going to work. They better for that price!

Update-
So far, 3 discs do not work and I can not exchange it, Amazon will only allow a return which I don't want to do! I want this whole series I would just appreciate new discs to replace the ones that don't work. If I were to return and purchase again I'd loose my $5 off I received on this purchase and now the price is about $70 more than what I paid. I'm actually disappointed in Amazon because they won't allow an exchange. There are 49 discs total and so far only 3 haven't worked so why would I decide to return the whole series because of a few discs? I wish Amazon would replace the defective discs but since this item is currently under review, this is not an option which sucks for me the paying customer!",1355270400,,1311,4.12109375

2861608,5,B000R7I43Q,"I appear to be yet another victim of the infamous glue drops. They range from the size of a grain of sand to about the size of a BB, little white lumps stuck to the discs. When I tried to remove them they just spread out in the gummy way glue does. However, through a great deal of effort, using tape to pull most of the glue drops off then my thumb to rub each spot till it could no longer be felt, I was able to get all the spots leveled. I say leveled, because wherever there was a glue drop it left a mark on the discs that is still visible. I have not yet tried to play these discs (and I was somewhat fortunate in that only 5 of the 49 discs in the set I received had glue on them), but I think they may play now. I was successful at pulling old hardened tape residue off of the playing surface of a DVD I bought from a seller on another site using tape to pull the old residue off and that disc wouldn't play at all when I got it and now it plays perfectly. My experience with DVD's is that a lot of scuffs and scratches that cannot be felt will play okay, but anything lumpy that you can feel with your finger is almost certain to cause glitches or playing issues. Many of the 49 Charmed discs in my set also have light scuffs from being inserted by the manufacturer into the tight cardboard pockets, but I do not think these will cause playing issues. Bottom line is, if the discs that had glue on them play through now without issues I probably got a good deal, if they don't I didn't. You can take a chance with this set or go with the more expensive deluxe set I guess.",1354406400,,1581,3.9905362776025237
2861609,1,B000R7I43Q,"First off, let me say that this review does not reflect the quality of the show, or even the content of the DVDs themselves.  Unfortunately, I have become a victim of the GLUE issue that has haunted this set from the beginning. Several discs were marked with glue that cannot be removed, and several were also scratched because of the cardboard sleeves in the packaging! All attempts to remove the glue failed, and in fact only made matters worse!  I have to admit that the ""Book Of Shadows"" packaging LOOKS very cool, but considering that the manner in which it is packaged DAMAGES THE DISCS, it is not worth it!  I have already returned it for a refund!  I would rather have a less cool package with all discs intact!  You would definitely be better off buying each season individually!",1354320000,4,788,4.6

The day i received it i opened it and loved the design of the book, then i saw how the discs were packaged. I put the first 3 discs in my player and all 3 skipped, i did not bother to check anymore. I then read all of the reviews on this set and almost everyone else had this problem, i returned it right away. I think amazon should pull this item from its site until the manufacture solves the problem. This gives an all knew meaning to"" you can't judge a book by it's cover"", even though i liked the cover. I will wait for the deluxe edition, which has the discs packaged better, to come on sale.",1353974400,,676,3.9416058394160585
2861623,5,B000R7I43Q,"So I've been borrowing the seasons of Charmed from the library every year but I've always wanted all the seasons for myself so one day I went on here and saw it was only $50 for all 8 seasons! My brains were blown and I immediately placed an order. 2 days later I heard the doorbell rang and I peered into the peephole and saw a box lying on the floor. I retrieved the box and started hopping up and down like a madman. It came sooner than I expected! I opened it very carefully and held it up in glory, my hands were shaking and I was shouting with sheer happiness. I looked through the Book of Shadows with my heart racing, the presentation is astounding and the layout is great. in fact, I sort of want to get a stand to put it on. I mean, you DON'T just put the Book of Shadows on your DVD rack (not that it would fit) or toss it in your closet. It's more than I ever imagined it to be, and I am one happy chick. I haven't actually watched any of it yet because I need to concentrate on school but once the semester's over I'm gonna be in hardcore Charmed Marathon mode. Anyways, as it is obvious, I am extremely satisfied with it, Charmed is my ultimate favorite TV Show, although, I think of it as more than a show. I LOVE CHARMED!!!! Merry Christmas to me! YEAH!!",1353974400,,1270,4.084
2861624,4,B000R7I43Q,"Love this show. I got a steal for 49.00 (I hope) because the book is fantastic! It does NOT have a cheap feel at all. Very very nice!

The dvd's (as everyone has stated) do slide in and out of cardboard. Each time you pull one out or put it back in you get this SINKING feeling that you're damaging the discs somehow. I pulled a few out to look at them and I have to admit some of them did NOT look good. There were scratches or some sort of small speckled substance on them. I decided to put one of the WORST looking ones in the dvd player (or bluray player in my case) just to see what would happen before I attempted to clean it. I was SURE that there would be problems playing this because the disc looked terrible. Guess what? I watched the entire thing and there were no problems playing it. I was kind of shocked. I suspect that some folks DVD players are able to read discs better than other dvd players. I really do NOT feel like going through ALL of these discs right at the moment, but I will have to do it soon before time runs out.

The transfers for both video and audio quality are great as I expected. From what I've seen so far, there is no music deletion from the show (which surprises me). This show would always start with a song while we got to see VERY COOL aerial shots of San Francisco leading up to the first act after the epilogue. Like I said, from what I've watched so far, it's all there. One thing that I don't like is I noticed that there is no ""play all"" feature! What I mean by that is on the disc I'm watching now, there are FOUR episodes. You simply choose which episode you want to watch. If you start with the first one, once it ends the next episode should play, right? It doesn't. It goes back to the menu and you have to manually choose the next episode. For the life of me I can't figure out why some dvd releases allow you to do an ""episode selection"" or just ""play all"" while others just allow the episode selection only. I suppose if your DVD player has a ""repeat entire disc"" function that it will play the entire disc on its own, but most dvd players I've used only allow to repeat title or chapter and not entire disc.

It's too bad they couldn't have used softer materials that hold the dvd's themselves while leaving the book material the same.",1353888000,2,2293,4.15990990990991

I've ordered an exchange/replacement & will go through those discs immediately upon receipt just as I did the first set. I'm hoping between the two sets I'll be able to get clean discs for the whole series - if not I'll return & reorder another exchange/replacement until I do get a clean discs for each season plus the bonus disc.

I know this was a problem previously & they were supposed to be reworking the packaging so that it didn't happen anymore but it would appear it's still a slight issue. I would recommend to everyone to check every single disc in the set as soon as you receive it to make sure they are all clean & playable.

I may end up getting a set of dvd cases for them, just to be safe.

I have had this for a month, maybe more and cant remove the discs.  They are (6 to a page) held together in a cardboard slot with these soft white diagonal thingies that are unfamilar to me.  There's not enuff room in the holder to pull them up. So i really don't know how you would remove them.  I now have 8 seasons (49 discs) in holders that have no function but to look at.  A waste of money really, what a shame.  I just wish these idiots who put these things together make User Friendly disc holders instead. If anyone knows how to remove them, i would sure like to hear from them.  I contacted the Seller, they were no help, just kept ignoring my emails.
Another omplaint i have is that they did not include all spells and information that was featured in the Series.  What a rip off.  They could have for that amount of money included the whole Book of Shadows the way it was in the Series!!!

After perusing Amazon for the best deal (and the coolest product), I settled on this to save up for as a housewarming gift to myself when I moved into my college dorm. I made sure to read all of the reviews, and was well aware of the potential for glue damage or unworking discs, but I figured I could always return it should it prove to be a problem. While yes, a handful of the discs had some glue on them, I decided to try and find a way to correct it without having to send the whole book back. I found that if you take rubbing alcohol on a q-tip or cotton square to remove the glue streaks and then clean the discs with a CD cleaning wipe, they run like new! I was so happy because the packaging is GREAT and it was a great value. Yes, it's probably not best for the manufacturer's reputation for a consumer to have to clean up after a production error, but if you have just a little bit of time to spare, it's totally worth the money and effort! I even find that it made me more excited to have been able to fix it so simply and be proud when the unreadable discs played after I cleaned them.

2861646,2,B000R7I43Q,"I read the bad reviews about glue from the sleeves damaging the discs and found that most of them were written years ago.
I threw my doubts out the window and assumed that they would have at least fixed the issue or Amazon would not let this product be sold in its store till the issue was resolved thus the item i'm purchasing could not have the glue issue right? Wrong!
Unfortunately my faith was not repaid as almost all the dics in the set had some glue damage and plenty of scratch and scuff marks. I did not even bother trying to clean them or testing them seeing it's a brand new product and no consumer should have to clean their own discs due to a manufacturing fault that has not been rectified despite plenty of complains.

I gave the item 2 stars. 1 star is because the concept and design was done very well. I loved the artwork and the build quality of the book. The other star is for Amazon's return and refund policy which they did so remarkably well and fast.

Amazon has to pay attention to their customer feedback though and pull out defective items from sale and preventing any customer complains.

The Book of Shadows container is a cute idea and is exactly what die hard fans would want.

2861653,5,B000R7I43Q,"What's the big draw???? First and foremost is the historical genius of Aaron Spelling....Did you know that his first joint production venture was Spelling-Thomas with Danny Thomas??? Then came the prolific productions with E.Duke Vincent..... Aaron Spelling and his talent and loyalty to his actors/actresses and the opportunities he continued to offer them beyond the scope of one series and/or ""one hat"" is reminicent of the great Howard Hawks as well as John Wayne. Second: Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano,Rose McGowen and Shannon Doherty all skilled actress who made the successful and ""dangerous"" metamorphosis from child actress and/or ""newbie"" to first rate adult actress, producers as well as launching numerous creative ventures. My favorite is the character ""Leo Wyatt"" brought to life by Brian Krause. Third:  Jennifer Rhodes ""Grams"" and Finola Hughes ""Patty"". Style, class..... and their careers include varied  creative projects. Fourth: the leading men: Julian McMahon, Eric Dane, Drew Fuller. Fifth: the character actors/actresses:  Billy Zane, Ron Perlman, Richard Robau, Oded Fehr, Charisma Carpenter. And last and certainly not the least:  THE STORY...estranged sisters come together in a time of familial crisis and decide over the course of time and experience to bury the hatched that kept them apart from so long and formed a close and powerful bond and fulfilled their destiny: to become the Charmed Ones..the most powerful witches to take on the Dark Side and then some. And just when you think the story must come to an end when the eldest sibling ""Pru"" makes the conscious decision to choose life for her sisters and perishes during a confrontation with an undefeatable foe...a forth sister is waiting in the wings...and the Charmed Ones are ""reconstituted"" and Piper,Phoebe, and Page find their shared destiny together-very different than that shared by Piper,Phoebe and Pru. I am captivated by Leo Wyatt, ""White Lighter"" to all of the Charmed Ones. He is an angel-in more ways than one. He waits patiently...on the periphery at first as the sisters find themselves as individuals and as family and their destiny...Leo as well transforms and grows as an individual in his capacity as angel, White Lighter, Elder, Human, loving spouse, father, brother in law, confidant and friend. No matter which ""hat"" Leo wears he is there to protect, guide, love and support. His very presence as well as his selfless acts aren't always immediately recognized. And then boom...realization...Leo is our anchor. I believe that we all have White Lighters reaching us in numerous ways over the course of a crisis or life time. And we too can be there for others.  A smile to a stranger, a compliment to the checker at the grocery store, rescuing an animal from death, cruelty, abandonment. A White Lighter does not have to know a person or an animal by name,face,place. We connect heart to heart, soul to soul. And this connection is reciprocal. Fire up the search engine and research the story line and contributors...be entertained...appreciate all that Charmed has to offer...and then perhaps you can appreciate the White Lighters in your life and make the decision to become a White Lighter and/or realize that you already are one.",1337040000,,3245,5.185114503816794

2861674,5,B000R7I43Q,"The presentation of this set is superb, it comes in the form of a book of manuscripts and in between the information pages are the discs. There are about 48 discs in the series, and will give many hours of watching pleasure to those interested in this series.
An excellent product at a great price.",1326240000,,298,4.4363636363636365
2861675,4,B000R7I43Q,"I love this show. I record it everyday on my dvr, so decided to purchase it. This is a wonderful series however the dvds are rather irritating because they don't go from one show to the next. You have to click on whichever program you want. I prefer a freeflowing dvd where it plays all on the disk then you can either start over or where ever you want. Other than that I love it.",1326153600,,380,4.08
2861676,4,B000R7I43Q,"I wanted to buy this, but was cautious because of all of the negative reviews. Imagine my surprise when my husband bought it for me for Christmas! I've worked in numerous video stores over the years, so my husband was confident that if the discs could be cleaned, I could do it. It's not something we should have to do, but if you want to skip the hassle of sending bad discs back over and over you can try this too. You can clean off the glue with a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol. Use a soft cloth (like one you may use to clean eyeglasses) to wipe the discs down. No, it won't get rid of the scratches, but I've found in my experience, the scratch has to be pretty deep for a disc not to play. Otherwise, some minor scratches won't hurt the playability of the disc. I'm now on the third season and, knock on wood, I haven't had any problems yet. I'll re-review after I finish the series. Good luck to anyone else who picks this item up.",1325462400,,939,4.164835164835165
2861677,5,B000R7I43Q,I loved the series when it was on tv originally and now my teenage daughter and I are watching it together.  It is really good series without all the crap you find in today's tv shows.  We are really enjoying them.,1325462400,,214,4.195121951219512
2861678,5,B000R7I43Q,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she is watching it constantly.  I won with this buy, hope she comes out of her room soon. We all love the way the DVD's are packaged like a book with information on each disc.",1325203200,,223,4.068181818181818

2861681,1,B000R7I43Q,Initial shipment and the replacement both had the glue substance and scratches that have already been talked about in other reviews. This is still is a problem. I hope eventually all the faulty copies work their way out and I can pick this up for the girlfriend.,1324252800,,262,4.595744680851064
2861682,4,B000R7I43Q,I was very satisfied with these DVD's until I got the the end of season 8. The last DVD in the set they sent me did not work. It took me a while to get through all the episodes and now it is passed the time to return the DVDS. SO if you purchase this check immediately that all the DVD's work so you can return them if they don't.,1323820800,,330,3.7285714285714286

2861684,4,B000R7I43Q,"So I have read all the reviews- bad and good. I bought my box set maybe about 2 weeks ago. I was aware of all the bad reviews of the jacket being bad cardboard and that some of the cd's actually had dried glue on them. I wanted this series desperately and couldn't afford the Deluxe with its 3-5 times higher price tag.

So once it got here I took every disk out and checked it. Some had little glue bits on it. I used my finger nail and they came off. I then took a damp towel and cleaned them. I did notice that the cardboard sleeves are not ideal, but if you are careful with it its not go bad. I am on season 5 and have not had one problem. There was one disc that was much worse then the others I cleaned. I almost couldn't get all the glue off. I was anxious about playing that one. Once I got to it though there were NO PROBLEMS. What a relief.

One of the things that made me buy this version with the 'bad rep' was how wonderful amazon is with returns. I knew that if I was unlucky and got a severely damaged and un playable disk(s) then they would work with me until the matter was settled.

So my advice is that if you want this season desperately and are willing to chance it like I did. THen buy through amazon. Check your disks, clean them gently if you have to, and watch them to make sure they are okay and don't skip.

All and all I have 4 out of 5 stars because there was a little glue (it took me no time to clean it off) and the disk jacket is not ideal for DVDs. However I am so happy to have the product and have a cute little book of shadows memorabilia.

Love it!",1323475200,4,1587,3.9161490683229814
2861685,2,B000R7I43Q,"Sadly I won't be purchasing from Amazon in the future due to the fact they don't address the Region area when we purchase from Australia, it is several layers down when you declare that you only provide region 1 product and by then I had the WII games and to send them back would mean the refund after paying delivery and return charges just arn't worth it, I will endeavour to sell them on ebay with full disclosure of the region.  Charmed some dvd players in Australia will play them so they should be alright.  Both were Christmas Presents for my grandchildren so I had to replace the WII games.

And i will say it again!! BEST GIRFT TO MYSELF EVER!! All the dvd's are good. I can easily remove the glue with a napkin and water its not that much glu just a dot on like 6 of the dvd's, none of my dvd's have skipped i have been able to watch the whole series with no problem. =)

2861696,1,B000R7I43Q,"I bought this because I only was able to watch part of the series when it aired, I wanted to have a complete set (I had Season 1 on DVD) and this set was on a spotlight deal at good price from Amazon.  I had hoped the packaging problems reported in reviews had been corrected.  Sadly they have not been corrected.

This is a problem I have seen several times with DVD's.  The ""Art Department"" designs a great looking package for the complete series offering, but forgets that people have to be able to get the disc's in and out of this package without damaging them.  Instead of plastic holders for each disc there are very tight paper pockets for each disc.

What I found when the set arrived is that every disc had scratches on it, 6 had glue on them (which is a 3D contamination that could easily damage your DVD or bluray player) and two of the paper pockets that hold the disc were torn.  I am returning this set (another trip to UPS) and have purchased the individual seasons (2 thru 8) for about the same price as the complete series cost.  If any of the individual season boxes have a problem I will just return that season for a replacement.  I lose out on the bonus disc, but I get much better packaging of each individual season.  Why can't the companies that make these things learn that they must be disc and user friendly?",1319068800,9,1336,4.329317269076305

Instead of letting me return and just get the individual seasons that I need to complete the set, have to go through this whole return, wait for refund ordeal and THEN purchase the individual seasons.  Some of which are very low stock.  Amazon really needs to rethink their customer satisfaction ideas.

This is a WARNING please read the 1 star reviews about the standard edition. There have been complaints about glue on the dvds, but this version has NO SCRATCHES on the dvds because they are protected by the snaps. Give a little more money and get this limited edition it is AWESOME!! I am forever charmed!! The One and ONLY complaint I have is that there is no protection on top of the book.

2. I've been reading that this is not sold by Amazon, but it is Mommy Bear Media who is buying it. Does this make any difference? Can the product be in bad condition if it is not sold by Amazon?

I checked out all of the disks and about three had small specs of glue on them, maybe five disks had some weird discoloration to them, and a few of the disks felt sticky on the sides of the disks. My brother and I played one disk that was discolored and it seemed to play fine. Although, we didn't play the whole disk, just a few minutes. Those were the only problems I had with the box set. Now, to the good part...

Talk about amazing box set! I was totally shocked to see some of the actual spells from the series! It is really awesome! I almost wanted to keep the set for myself upon seeing the spells! Lol.

2861721,1,B000R7I43Q,"Bought these as a surprise gift for my wife and nine year old daughter who have been watching the series in reruns.  They love the show and I was really excited to surprise them.

Too bad the very first disc won't play.  I looked and many other discs had the same scratch/glue issue.

I've sent an email to Paramount at PHE_CustomerService@paramount.com (got the address from [...]).  There used to be a special toll free number for the issue, but it is no longer in service.

I'm hoping that Paramount will replace just the discs - and let me place them into the ""Book of Shadows"" perhaps with individual protective sleeves.

If not, I'll be returning the whole set.  :(  At least I tested them before showing my wife and daughter so they aren't disappointed.

Edit:  I received a reply to my email and Paramount has agreed to replace the discs.  Per their email:  ""We can replace the (discs only) because you purchased the Charmed set from Amazon directly and not a third party.  We'll order your replacement discs which you should receive in about 4 weeks.  No need to send us your discs.""  I specifically asked for the discs only in the hope that not being in the ""Book of Shadows"" packaging, they won't be scratched.  I'm thinking about getting some clear disc notebook page holder to insert into the Book instead of reusing the cardboard slots.

Update:  I just received the replacement discs.  Each disc is in a paper sleeve.  They appear to be in good shape.  So Paramount came through!  Now I just need to figure out how to store the new discs.",1306281600,18,1553,4.567272727272727

Was a little worried after reading all the reviews about the sticky glue and scratching problems resulting from the cardboard sleaves of the book packaging.  I don't know if they have now come up with a solution, BUT I WAS RELIEVED when i opened my box set book, to find all my discs were individually wrapped/inserted into a 'soft' plastic sleave(similar to that of a old vinyl record, before being inserted into the cardboard sleave of the book.  Thankfully, due to this, all my discs are in perfect condition.

As i said, not sure if this was the case for all the previous damaged box set's mentioned, or if this has been a new solution put in place, but it seems to have worked.  just wanted to let anyone know that might be thinking of getting it but worried about the scratch or glue problem.  Fingers crossed, this is the case from now on.

2861723,1,B000R7I43Q,"I didn't want to give this wonderful series 1 star, I really didn't. I adore Charmed, and this set was a great way to collect the entire series. Plus, you get a cute replica of the Book of Shadows to tote around. It is really lovely to be able to leaf through the book as you watch the series, and read the spells and episode synopsis's (all in old style writing, with quotes on each page from the series). I had never seen a 'complete series' quite like this one, and that made me want it. Badly.
Upon receiving it however, I noticed several of the discs had scratches and glue press marks on them, so I sent it to Amazon for a replacement - which they got to me within the week (I had it sent Priority International Courier). With my previous set and this new one, as soon as I opened the book, the spine (front not side) split and lifted (a poor glue job, made it look cheap).
Was very disappointed to discover that the replacement set was even worse, Season 4 was the most affected with discs 3, 5 & 6 with glue marks which made them skip, pause, stutter and pixelate. Disc 6 of season 4 was stuck to the paper sleeve so I had to really work it loose, and some of the paper came off onto the dvd. Now, having known about the glue from my previous set, I cleaned each dvd with a microfibre cloth, which helped - but when it came to season 4 those glue marks wouldn't dissolve or budge. Even if I managed to get the glue off, there was sometimes a scratch or two left behind (even though i was extremely gentle). Other discs would stop or stutter near the end of episodes. The bonus disc simply refused to play some of the featurettes, or was very choppy.
All i want is to have my Book of Shadows edition without scratches and glue, is it too much to ask? Either Paramount fix this issue or Amazon stop selling it! I wonder if by removing the discs each time from the sleeve this may cause new scratches.
Some people have said that they remove the discs and put them in jewel cases to preserve them, but why would i want to spend more money, when this one was already expensive enough and really, should just work? It's the principle of it, if i buy dvds, i expect them to work. I realize that this is a production/supplier  issue and not an Amazon one, but I am *so* bitterly disappointed, that *twice* my dvds didn't work. They should have these dvds in a plastic ring thing, instead of the sleeves. Am going to return this, I don't think I want to risk a third time (even though it may be the Charm, hehe), as it costs a bit to send back (I am from outside the US - though Amazon will refund me when they receive it) and get a product that is even more damaged than this one. I am really angry about this. I spend ages checking each DVD (playing each chapter of *all* episodes) then when I'm done just have to send it right back.
The upside to this: Amazon customer service is absolutely brilliant! They refunded my money promptly as well as reimbursing what it cost me to send the product back to them (and coming from new zealand, it wasn't cheap- that package is heavy). Not happy with the product, but Amazon really look after the customer :)",1305936000,2,3151,4.225538971807628

The only dissapointing thing is the bonus DVD,it didn't play well and cuts in and out as you try to watch the original un-aired episode and the extra's.

2861725,2,B000R7I43Q,"As in the previous cases where people have commented that the discs come with glue residue on the discs, so is my package which I have ordered for my wife as a present. Most of the discs have this residue and a kind of scratch where the envelope ended and pressure was applied. DVDs freeze at many places, and even the root menu is not displayed well. I have to skip to title menu to try and play anything, and then it will freeze in the middle of the episode and won't budge.
 I had hoped that for the time this item has been on sale this problem would have been resolved, but apparently they didn't fix it. Now I'm looking who to turn to to provide me with a replacement DVDs (just the discs, no fancy package), since this is a manufacturing fault which affected many if not all packages from this product line.

Can you suggest if there's a way and who should I email/call to get a replacement DVDs for this highly priced, fancy packaged, badly manufactured item?

Appreciate your comments.

There is always a lesser or smaller edition,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charmed-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001BN4WL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charmed: The Complete Series</a>, but after reading feedback from the people who bought the lesser edition, i decided to get the Deluxe one due to the fact that i want my DVDs to be playable. Reviews mentioned that the lesser edition has DVDs which has glue marks on the DVDs due to the gluing process and the Deluxe edition has some scratch marks.

I have always love the concept of the Book of Shadows and that is why i bought this edition. However, i did hope that they would have included more significant pages from the Book of Shadows in to the Deluxe edition from the seasons 1 - 8 rather than what it seems to me as random. Hoping for Book of Shadows entries like, Dominus Trinus (the spell that gave the girls their power), villain pages (The Source, Shax...), etc. The DVD summary pages are great and i love the designs for that.",1296691200,,1331,6.0
2861737,3,B000R7I43Q,"So I have been looking to buy this product for a while, saw all the bad reviews, but decided to take a leap of faith and bought the product.  I opened it, and saw that there were a few scratches on some discs and a few discs had miniscule amounts of glue.  The worst scratched discs played fine on my computer, so I wasn't worried about the scratches.  I went on to play a disc on my DVD player, and the 3rd and 4th episodes of the disc were skipping all over the place.  I put another disc in and there was also skipping, but again only on the 3rd and 4th episodes.  I started looking around and found that some DVD players if they do not have an updated firmware do not play the DVDs well.

So, I give this item three stars because even though the packaging is not so good (make sure you lift the DVD up towards you before you slide it out, there is a lip inside that can scratch it if you just pull it out), a lot of the playing problems is because the firmware needs to be updated on a lot of DVD players.  So don't give up on this set so quickly!  I may end up going out and buying a DVD case and just move the DVDs into that case to reduce future scratching, but so far it is not a problem.",1296000000,,1196,3.9132231404958677

2861742,1,B000R7I43Q,"First off, Charmed was an amazing show and you won't be disappointed watching it. Having said that, this book set is a piece of crap. The idea of it is fantastic and really cool. You get your own little book of shadows and I thought it was a really creative idea. The only problem is that when you take some of the discs out, they have glue marks all over them and are unable to be used. I tried to watch the very first disc and my xbox was unable to read it so then I looked at the back and noticed a straight line of glue right down the side of the disc that I could not remove just by rubbing. I decided to try the disc in my playstation 2, a dvd player, and my laptop... but none of them would play the disc. That's when I came here and saw all the other 1 star reviews claiming they had the same issue with the glue on the discs. I wish I would have saw all the 1 star reviews before I purchased this set, but when should you have to read reviews on a series set unless you want to know if the series is good or not?

ANYWAY, I'd suggest spending the extra $50 or whatever the amount is for the other series set or just buy each season separately.",1293235200,,1152,3.923076923076923

Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is.

The 'pages' are not obviously regular paper, they are mostly heavy cardstock, so they won't tear easily, if at all, you'd have to really try to damage it.  Not only is it a beautiful way to house the series, but it also makes a great display piece and people always ask me about it and want to see it.  Just be sure you have a sturdy shelf because this does have some weight to it  And it is like a foot tall, also. One other little feature that I really liked, it may not seem like a big thing to anyone else, but I really liked it:  there is a red ribbon bookmark attached to mark where you got your last dvd from.

2861762,5,B000R7I43Q,"Probably one of the best new-age shows to grace our televisions, Charmed boasted superb special effects, juicy and riveting storylines and beautiful (and talented) actors/guest stars - an overall Aaron Spelling gem!  Admittedly, I was most disheartened by the Season 3 exit of Shannen Doherty, but the show must go on, and go on it did - for 8 full and enjoyable seasons!  The show would eventually sow the seeds of upliftment for its respectable and realistic portrayal of the Wiccan 'religion', which had been tainted for centuries - with witches often being portrayed as evil, revenge-seeking, cauldron-stirring, broomstick-flying banshees who were out for personal gain.  There are not many TV shows that can boast 8 seasons, but Charmed continued to mesmerise, educate, entertain and enthral.  It remains up there with the likes of several long-running and highly popular comedies, sitcoms and dramas, such as Dallas, Friends, Will & Grace, Law and Order, Seinfeld, Knots Landing, Murder She Wrote, Beverly Hills 90210, Cheers, Frasier and Three's Company.

This DVD box set (actually, ""book set"") is smaller than its predecessor, which had been issued not long before it.  You will note from several other reviewers that discs had been ruined by glue - the result of the box design which calls for random insertion of the DVDs in pockets cut into specific artistic cardboard pages.  However, it would appear that this problem was swiftly dealt with after the initial complaints that were raised upon its release.  This set is a delight, especially for the Charmed fan.  It is themed on the Book of Shadows as used in the actual series, and contains virtual carbon copies of some of the pages.  In fact, all 8 seasons are set within the ""mock"" Book of Shadows.  You may very well be surprised when you note the impeccable quality of the 'book' design and paper.  The front cover, in particular, is a complete replica of that found in the series - complete with the ""now Wiccan-adopted"" triquetra and the green taping along the book's spine.

Get your hands on a copy of this box set, and you will not be disappointed.  Not only is the design a complete delight, but also the episodes contained in all 49 discs that are set within the delightful Book of Shadows.

Even though the disks arrived in perfect condition, I think that I was right to have bought a different container for the DVDs.

I chose to get something that would better protect it.

Other than the slight problems with the book, everything else seems to work perfectly, i have not tried out all of the discs, but I have checked them for scratches and glue, there where no signs of any of this.

I received this as a Christmas gift but Amazon told me the return expiration date passed on December 4th so they would not work with me to return the item. Highly disappointing.

To anyone that loves this show I would recommend that you but the individual seasons even though it will cost a bit more. This box set is not worth the $175 you spend.

A great series in a wonderful package.  The Book of Shadows though smaller than what appears in the show holds many hours of magical viewing entertainment(Not only the DVDs but the excellent art work).  When I read about some issues with the book's glue for the disc holders I was really not sure if I wanted to purchase or not.  However let me just say that I am very glad I did.  Out of 49 DVDs only 7 had minor glue spots, which I am told can be cleaned up easily with some CD cleaner(Test soon to come).  Only downside I can see is that I will most likely purchase a CD case. Simply because the paper sleeves you slide the discs in will scratch the DVDs with time and multiple use.

2861793,5,B000R7I43Q,"That's the only negative comment I have about this set: that you really need to get (or make) a stand for this, perhaps a replicate version of the one used on the actual show. It's not so much a negative criticism as it is a bit of advice--the set puts other complete series sets to shame and deserves a great presentation in the entertainment room (or attic).

The show itself has its ups, its downs, its in-betweens, but, generally speaking, it holds up fairly well as a show about three sisters and their whitelighter. It has plenty of camp appeal, plenty of teen appeal, plenty of 18-24 male appeal, etc. If skeptical TV watchers have shied away from this because of the fantasy element, they'd do well to realize that ""Charmed"" has a little bit of something for everything. Although I typically shy away from that sort of media, ""Charmed"" manages to avoid taking itself too seriously which is what makes it enjoyable. Watch it with mom, dad, brother, sister, cousin, grandpa, whoever.

Now, the set, as I've said, is fantastic. It's about as close to the real Book of Shadows as you'd expect; actually more than expected. The individual releases are all a bit cheap and tacky looking. Slim sets, all basically looking the same except with different colors. Eh. Not interesting. In fact, that's what made me think of the show as ""cheap"", as something not worth watching.

The book is in very sturdy hardback, with fairly thick pages. Best of all, many of the pages have very sharp looking reproductions of a selection of the screen-used pages. Again, they are exactly the opposite of ""cheap"". Best of all--in comparison with the regular edition of this set--the pages have little cardboard pieces for the discs; none of that sticking-DVDs-in-paper-slits stuff.

There's really not much else to say about it, except that it's a shame that the set isn't widely available. If you can find a used copy of it, or perhaps a leftover copy at a Borders or other retailer, snatch it up! I found mine at a Borders towards the end of February, and was able to use a Borders Rewards coupon to bring the price down to about $230, only $60 more than the smaller edition--which isn't bad because you really get a lot more bang for your buck.",1241222400,2,2230,4.666666666666667
2861794,5,B000R7I43Q,"I initally bought this because of Alyssa Milano, Hollie Marie-Combs, and Rose Mcgowan. Three gorgeous ladies, magic, and mythology. Was I wrong! Granted the episodes with Shannen Doherty were good, but when Rose McGowan showed up I got really hooked. The character development is awesome. Seeing the sisters go from scared young women, to full bore tough gals is way cool. I also enjoyed how they tied mythology from many different regions of the world, and incorporated them into the story line. Lastly, I really like how they titled the episodes very clever!

2861800,5,B000R7I43Q,"I've been wanting but waiting to buy this edition of the series for months wondering if the money would be well worth it.  It was!  It's a full size replica of the book - weighing close to 10 pounds - and when closed it looks as though this were a real book with gold foiled page edges.  The sections that hold the disks are thick and sturdy.  The few sheets from the series' BOS are inter-mixed with pages that outline that season's episodes and look like they could belong in the BOS as well.  It even comes with the two ribbon markers, one red and one black, which are in the show's book.
If you are a fan of the show or are considering giving this to a fan you know, this is definitely a 'box' set worth collecting.  Everyone will have their opinion of what sort of pages they'd like to see from the series but what has been included in this package is nothing short of amazing.  ""To Call A Lost Witch"" (which we've seen in the series itself several times) and ""Balthazar"" are part of this.
The only downside I experienced was removing the bonus disk that is included in the back of the book.  The envelope it's located in fits the disk snugly, but it's glued to the book and you have to take time and gently pull the disk out so as to not rip the envelope that holds it or scratch the disk in the process.",1237507200,2,1310,4.170634920634921

It's a smaller version of the TV BOS complete with embossed Triquetra, with some of the familiar illuminated pages reproduced along with an interior episode guide.

I received my set as a gift, so although it's not nice to look a gift-horse in the mouth, there are some very real drawbacks that other reviewers have mentioned. The discs are stored in cardboard ""pockets"" as pages in the BOS that seem to have scratched them in transit (some discs more than others) - and probably will continue to scratch them each time you put them away. I plan to get a set of empty jewel cases to keep the discs in to prevent this. The other problem is yes the glue. Although my set seems to be less glued-up than others reviewed here, there is some. I successfully removed the glue dots and lines with medical alchohol prep pads (always GENTLY cleaning in straight lines, never in circular motion)and wiping completely dry with a lint free cloth. The discs play just fine in spite of the minor scratches and post cleaning.

2861808,5,B000R7I43Q,"Charmed The Complete Series Limited Deluxe Edition box set is the best box set to date. It is WELL worth the extra money. The Limited Deluxe Edition box set is to the actual scale size of the Book of Shadows on the Charmed set. So you ask yourself what makes the limited deluxe boxset so different than the smaller version so I will tell you...The size is A LOT bigger, the quality of the pictures are better (thicker paper and better pictures), and the dvd holders are better (deluxe edition has round squishy holders to hold in the dvds whereas the regular version has slits in the paper which scratches the disks when you take them out). There is one downfall with the sets...deluxe edition has some scratches on the disks and the regular version has glue on the disks. So far I haven't had any problems with any of my disks.

Also you can't forget the bonus disk that comes with the complete series that you cannot get anywhere else. It includes quite a few extras including the pilot episode of Charmed where Pheobe isn't played by Alyssa Milano. This is an excellent bonus disk and a great addition to the dvd set.

Charmed Storyline: Prue, Piper, and Phoebe are sisters who live together. Phoebe finds The Book of Shadows in their attic and then they find out they are powerful witches...The Charmed Ones. Together they fight evil everyday while trying to have a somewhat ""normal"" life. Later on down the road they also find out that they have a baby half sister named Paige who is also a witch/white lighter. Watch to find out more.

2861811,4,B000R7I43Q,"When I really think about it, I realize what a good show Charmed really is. There are times when I think about certain episodes or the acting or special effects, and I'm not sure if it was supposed to be campy, or to be taken seriously as a drama. Maybe it was a dramedy. I'm not sure as of now. I should probably watch it again before I write this review but oh well. There are also times when I think back to episodes and they struck a chord with me. Many episodes were dark, intense, brutal, exciting, magical, and sometimes even a little scary. These were the best kinds of Charmed episodes. People will say that the later seasons were too cheesy and not serious, and I agree that the eighth season was only meant for people who were desperate for more Charmed, but even seasons 5, 6 and 7 had it's good shows. No matter what the episode was like, I think the idea behind it was that it was to be a fun time. Maybe it wasn't the best of TV but it was fun and entertaining. Charmed had so many high highs and low lows that it feels like a full show. A show that has experience and made use of its impressive run. When I tell someone I like Charmed they will laugh and say ""hahahaha THAT show???"" but they just see the cheesy, girl power side to it. They never see the creative and smart side to it which is really what made it cool. I think it should have ended after its 7th season, but since episode one, it's been a fun popcorn show that verges on silliness but embraces the dark and action-packed stuff people like. I'd say, catch it on TNT more than a few times, and then decide if its good enough for you to buy the DVD. It definitely aint for everyone (I'm surprised I ever watched it!) but I would recommend it to you personally because it really overall is an excellent show with great production values, not to mention the glorious shots of the California skies at the beginning of every episode.

Thankfully, most of my discs were free of glue. I made it all the way to season 4 before I noticed any damage. In the end, only two of my discs had glue on them. The good news is you can remove the glue with rubbing alcohol. Unless there is a lot of glue on your disc, you can easily clean the glue away with rubbing alcohol and some cotton.

2861813,5,B000R7I43Q,I bought this to give as a Christmas gift for a sibling who is a huge Charmed fan.  It was an excellent gift!!  Book of Shadows is a good replica of book in series.  The DVD's themselves each have their own sleeve per season and are the snap-in kind -- offers great protection for them.,1231718400,3,286,4.163636363636364
2861814,5,B000R7I43Q,I found the Charmed Book of Shadows while traveling in Australia 2006 that contained seasons 1 through 7 with a place holder for season 8 and hoped this version would reach the states.  Well the wait is no more and the best is that Charmed: The Complete Series - Limited Deluxe Edition contains the entire series and is fantastic for any Charmed fan who wanted to own a copy of the Book of Shadows.  This version does not contain all images but a nice selection of the pages and holds the DVDs in place via a soft rubber tab making the presentation quite ingenious!  This version is full-size whereas the other release of this is half the size not true to the actual prop used in Charmed.,1231632000,2,688,4.4015748031496065

2861816,5,B000R7I43Q,"As an avid Charmed fan, I had already spent the dough to purchase each season set as it was released...needless to say it added up to a lot of money spent.  Regardless, I couldn't resist buying this uniquely designed set.  (As well as the Limited Edition Deluxe version!)  I figured it would be a wonderful collector's piece, and I just had to have it!  I was not disappointed!  The book is really well made, and looks like a real book.  When you open it, there are pages replicated from the original Book of Shadows from the show, combined with pages with slots for the DVDs themselves.  While many people have had issues with glue and scratches on their discs, I did not seem to have that problem to a degree that affected the usage of the discs.  There were a few discs that had a very little bit of glue, and there were other discs that had some minor scratches, but all of the discs played fine. (I even read in another review that someone bought some DVD cleaner and the glue came right off.)

***IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE DISCS IN YOUR COLLECTION-PLEASE NOTE:  As of 11/25/08, the distributors of these collections set up a toll free number for customers to call if they received discs that were damaged.  The number is 800-728-8564. (This number works for the US and Canada.)  They will replace any problem discs.***

This is a wonderful series that has finally been represented well with this unique Book of Shadows replica.  If you've never seen the show before, buy it and enjoy!  If you are already a Charmed fan, you won't be disappointed with this collection.  You will be especially pleased with the bonus disc that has many more extras than had previously been released, including the original unaired pilot that Alyssa Milano was not a part of.  My only complaint, is that the original theme song was changed for the DVD releases of Season 8.  But, unfortunately, this was done to all Season 8 releases, not just this special edition.",1231286400,2,1959,4.580459770114943

The discs are held firmly in place on very thick and heavy cardboard. I've never seen such quality and I own well over 100 tv seasons of various shows!!

I have but one complaint or warning to those of you that haven't purchased this yet. 95% of the discs were scratched. Some lightly, some pretty bad. However, I notified Paramount and they took care of replacing the damaged discs for me. Just be warned of this. It's still worth every single penny!",1231286400,3,761,4.474820143884892

2861819,5,B000R7I43Q,"This review covers the packaging only for the Charmed complete series set.  I am not reviewing the series itself.  I was hesitant to buy this because I had read an online review stating that discs were arriving scratched or covered in glue, and even a few Amazon reviews stated this.  Nevertheless, it was my wife's number-one Christmas gift, and I decided to take the risk.  I am glad that I did.

I personally inspected each and every disc on Christmas night, and I found only two that had the tiniest bit of glue.  Using a regular DVD washer, found for about ten dollars at Best Buy, I cleaned both discs and the glue came off immediately.  Thus far, every disc plays perfectly.

I don't doubt that some people have defective sets, but I wanted to state that, having ordered it from Amazon, it arrived in great condition.  That said, the box itself is a bit clunky and I'm troubled that there is no clasp so that it tends to open on the shelf unless wedged between two comparable DVD sets.  Still, it's a nifty little prop replica and really thrilled my wife, a dedicated Charmed fan.

For those considering upgrading, all that this set includes exclusively is a single bonus disc and, of course, interesting packaging.  Since I did not own any of the season sets previously, this was a smart buy.  Not sure how smart it would be, however, for someone who already owns part or all of the series.",1230854400,6,1398,4.52191235059761

2861821,5,B000R7I43Q,"Let me start out by saying this is a different kind of review and as you read on you will find out why. I am assuming that anyone who has bought this edition or is thinking about it already knows what a marvelous show this was to have succeeded eight years on the air. anyone investing this kind of money knows this. There fore I decided to review the presentation of this most unusual and incredible packaging, etc... Read on:

I absolutely love this deluxe limited edition. Worth every penny. I repeat, Anyone who has invested this much money to purchase this copy already knows that the series is fabulous. I want to talk about the presentation of the book of shadows edition. I saw the much smaller one in a store. It was half the size and quite frankly disappointing looking. Plus I heard that there was a problem with glue getting on the discs. This GORGEOUS edition is just that gorgeous. It's just like owning your own Book of Shadows.

Beautifully and artistically rendered. I was an art major in college and am very critical about art in general. I was so impressed when I opened up this very heavy package I received in the mail that I knew what it was right away, as I get a lot of packages in general. This lovely rendering of The Book of Shadows does not disappoint. Whomever put this together should be very proud of themselves whether it be one person or a collaboration.

I was honestly sorry that I didn't buy a few books. When the descriptions came out for the two different versions they were the same and there was no way of telling what the differences were. One just had to take a gamble and I decided I best go with the more expensive one hoping that I wasn't making a mistake. Thrilled that I made the right choice I highly recommend any charmed fan or even a new watcher of the series to just not waste time and get this edition right off the
bat. You won't in anyway be sorry.

The only thing I feel they could have done better was the packaging of the book itself. I feel that it should have had a cover on the box itself for protection. It's not too late for the manufacturer to make covers and offer them for a couple bucks. I bet they would fly right out
of the warehouse as I cannot be the only person that feels this way.
Something so beautiful really should be better protected.

Also, a small thing but nonetheless nice would have been if they had added a few more ribbon page dividers. All in all I couldn't be happier that I chose the full size authentic rendering of Charmed's ""Book of Shadows"" disc set. I'm just altogether THRILLED in case anyone didn't catch my opinion the first time. Just kidding!

This is truly a work of art worthy of displaying the artwork in the book itself. It goes without saying that the Series is the obvious reason anyone buys the seasonal collections. Yet in this particular case that Is why I chose to review the actual Book of Shadows packaging more than or at least equal to the DVD set. This reminds me of when I was a child and cared more about the wrapping paper than the gift itself. At least the principal holds up. I display mine in my living area of my home. It's as much a piece of artwork as the paintings I have hanging on my walls.

A real catch if you can still find one. A++++ rating.",1230595200,83,3270,4.315960912052117

When I got it home, I went online to look at the reviews for it and noticed that people were complaining about the glue from the sleeves having come off on the discs. I pulled all of my discs out, and realized that 21 out of the 49 discs were either ruined by glue (that doesn't come off) or had scratches. I went back to the store to see if they could switch out the discs with another set. 45 minutes and 4 opened sets later I realized that every single set had this problem. To the point that I wasn't even able to make up 1 good set. Luckily I was able to purchase the ""Deluxe Edition"" at another store for $50 more.

This set in very nice, and would have been worth the money if there wasn't such a bad manufacturers defect. My suggestion would be to try and get your hands on a ""Deluxe"" set if you can afford it (It has actual snaps for the discs, so glue won't be an issue. Also it is bigger and more sturdy feeling). If this is not an option, make sure you check over every disc in the set as soon as you get it so that you can either exchange or return it if necessary. Hopefully they issue some sort of recall so that people who purchased this can get it replaced with one that is not ruined!

2861835,5,B000R7I43Q,"Fans of Charmed have long complained of the way the series was treated with it's DVD releases.  Zero special features on the season 1-7 sets was always aggravating to fans considering the show has such a strong following who were hoping for some extras on the DVD's.  It was a nice treat for the final season to get some good special features, however we still were hoping for more.  Now, with the release of the series set, fans get the DVD release that they long deserved.  This series set is beautiful and one that fans will be happy with.  The packaging is amazing by itself, a replica of the Book of Shadows that has been a staple of the series.  Not only is the over of the packaging resembling the book, but the interior as well with artwork from the book seen in the series used as pages in the set.  Along with seasons 1-8, fans also get treated to an additional bonus disc to make up for the lack of features in seasons 1-7.  This bonus disc has some nice featurettes, the best one is 'The Power of Three' which interviews the cast and crew about the dinamic of the sisters and how it made the show the success it was.  It's nice to see some new interviews with Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan as well as series show-runner Brad Kern.

2861838,5,B000R7I43Q,"As the owner of the individual 'Season' editions of all eight seasons of ""Charmed"", my initial reaction to ""Charmed: The Complete Series"" was less than enthusiastic (it has already been a nearly $400 investment!), but let me say, truthfully, this looks like a vastly superior route, for fans.

First off, ""Charmed: The Complete Series"" offers a brand new disc of 'Special Features'; in all of the eight 'Season' editions, the only real 'bonus' features ever offered was in the 'Season Eight' package, with the Shannen Doherty years (Seasons 1-3) and Julian McMahon's 47-episode run as Alyssa Milano's half-demon soulmate, Cole Turner, rather tersely covered; this new disc offers hope that more attention will be given to Prue and Cole, as well as Phoebe, Piper, Paige, Leo, and all the other major recurring cast members of the series.

Second, the packaging looks, well, magical! The individual 'Season' packages seemed to get smaller, and less impressive, after the 'Season One' boxed set, which was more cost-effective, I'm sure, but disappointing to loyal fans, like me; the 'Complete Series', with it's beautiful 'Book of Shadows'-inspired 'look', would certainly grace any DVD collection, whether you are a 'Power of Three' devotee, or not!

Third, the price is pretty unbeatable, less than half of the cost of buying each season, individually.

So, I'm going to save up some money, and invest in this new edition...and I highly recommend it to all fans of the remarkable Halliwell Sisters!",1226793600,13,1497,5.1735537190082646

2861844,5,B000R7I43Q,"My Review - Worth Getting.

Both the 'standard' 'Book Of Shadows' DVD release and this...the 'Collectible Edition' would satisfy your cravings for all things magical. However, if you are a true Charmie, then this is the only release that you should consider. Here's why.

Whlie we all know that good things come in small packages, if you are a Charmed fanatic then size matters! This is the only edition that is the exact size of the TV prop book. The regular edition is roughly the size of a photo album. The art reproductions of spell pages that are reproduced for this edition are exact copies. This meant that there was no need to reformat the columns etc to fit. The regular edition was changed significantly to fit the unusual page configuration.

The color of both editions is a true forest green and very close to the original. I was asked recently if the cover was an exact reproduction of the original and while the picture released for the presale mockup was definately different, the final version is much closer. They have added the cover corner pieces and also appropriate taping along the spine to match the original. Now for Charmies, the 'Triquetra' on the cover is a very important feature. Spelling Productions still owns the rights to the original art and although this was created using new art, it is the best I have seen, and I have seen many. It appears as it should aged appropriately as a book circa 1620. The edging of this edition is a beautiful guilded antique gold. The guilding is different from the ragged edge of the original but it would have been obviously costly to use true vellum sheets, so this is an excellent concession. One more point on the guilding...it stays put! I can't tell you how many costly leather bound volumes I have that leave sparkly residue on my fingers! There is none of that here as it was done very well and by a manufacturer with guilding experience. The standard release does have a 'ripped edge' but in my opinion since it doesn't look authentic, this is still a much better choice.

Now for the most important feature or difference between the two editions. Remember, all fancy packaging aside, you want protection for your discs! This edition features eight pieces of sturdy foam-core material in which your DVD discs are inset. There is an octagon shaped foam piece in the center of each slot which holds the disc firmly in place and does not permit uneccessary spinning. Each season in it's entirety is on a single page. The standard edition makes use of simple, thin cardboard slits cut two to a page. While the jury is still out on the long term effects of this type of protection, I believe it will scratch your discs over time, especially with repeated viewings. Another reason to only consider the Deluxe Collectors Edition.

Both releases feature excellent individual show descriptions for each episode and nice photos interspersed throughout. If you know of the earlier Australian release last year, the descriptions and photos are exactly the same. And while on the subject of that earlier release, they did away with the hokey LED lights on the Triquetra and this edition is near perfect. The edition is not numbered as was the case with the Australian release. I have been asked that question and I can now tell you while not numbered, it is limited and sold out already at most locations. My guess that it was produced in numbers significantly less than the 13000 pressed for the DVD region 4 release. Don't wait or you will be found wanting as the holidays rapidly approach.

Enjoy Charmed!",1217030400,191,3570,4.731511254019293
2861845,3,B000R7I43Q,"I've enjoyed this series for years now. I already own the box sets but I am a big enough fan to upgrade. I noticed from enlarged photos on another website that this version in addition to being smaller than the Deluxe Limited version appears to use cardboard sleeves to protect the discs. The Deluxe appears, at least in the photos to use snap on holders which I believe protect the discs from scratches better than card board. I suppose it's all in how you handle them though.

UPDATE 11/12/08- The Limited Deluxe Edition is now out of print. That is the other larger version with trays. FYI...I wanted to let you all know that someone posted pictures here of the Larger Deluxe edition. Specifically, the last three pictures are of that edition. If you order here, you will recieve the smaller (two discs high) version held onto the pages with simple slits.

UPDATE 11/19/2008- RE: Manufacturing issues

My underrstanding is that the folks at CBS DVD are aware and looking into the issues surrounding both sets.

My additional advice would be not to avoid your purchase, but rather purchase from Amazon or another trusted source who will work with you for your particular resolution if you are unlucky, as I and others unfortunately were. We are Charmed Fans and are very loyal to our favorite series. Doing without this set is just not an option for some of us, we've waited years watching special releases in various other countries.

When we notified Amazon about this problem, they immediately sent a replacement for the entire series with no problems.  My son received the new shipment within days.
I am an avid fan of Charmed and had recommended the series to my son.

I am very satisfied with the customer service, and the product purchased from Amazon.",1210291200,,458,4.6875

2861850,4,B000R7I43Q,"When I first saw charmed I fell head over heels for it. I bought the complete series and knew that it would be good. I like woman-power tv shows such as Bufy, Veronica Mars, and others. I liked charmed because it had a different angle, less of a varity more vocused on magic and demons. Now i kind of wish that I watched more of it on T.V. Even though it is a great show, I am not going to keep watching the episodes over and over again. But if you know that you are going to watch them over again I would buy this. However it doesn't really matter if you buy every season indiidually of all of them at the same time, the difference is about 10$. Even today Knowing that I am not going to watch the charmed episodes over and over again, I still would have bought this. Even though the packaging isn't really fancy like the british one, it is nicer because you don't have a clunky chest that says CHARMED on it.  If I were you I would buy this.",1206144000,,943,4.06989247311828

Now that I have the complete series I am able to watch them when I want to and not on any TV schedule.  If you love Charmed then you need to buy the complete series.  The only thing I miss is season 8 does not have the Love Spit Love version of the opening credits.  They are great no matter what musice they have.,1204502400,,418,3.8705882352941177

You can purchase (if you want) Charmed at BJ'S price club for $29.99 easch season ($240.00 for the complete series).

2861858,4,B000R7I43Q,"Charmed is a great supernatural series about 3 sisters who discover they're powerful witches and have to protect the innocent every week from the darkest of evils as the Charmed Ones. During the course of its 8 year run, Charmed had lots of ups and downs, having more downs than ups unfornately. From its dark and gloomy first season to the utter fluff of the final season, Charmed is a series that transformed dramatically, and it wasn't mostly for the best. Creator Constance Burge started the series on a very high note, making the first 4 seasons brilliant television while after her exit Brad Kern turned the series into a shadow of its former self and the show lost it's edge. Between main characters leaving (Shannen Doherty's Prue) to ridiculous story developments (Nymphs, Spider demons, etc), the show's last 4 seasons were mostly poor and lacked the true depth the series once had. But whatever the case, All 8 seasons can be summed up like this:

Season 1 (1998-1999)-It begins when Phoebe Halliwell moves back in with her sisters, Prue and Piper Halliwell. They are 3 normal, everyday sisters who each share a defining personality. Once Phoebe reads the words from the Book of Shadows, they become the Charmed Ones, the most powerful witches in the world. But being Charmed comes with a price when the sisters battle against a variety of warlocks and demons for the first time. But they are not alone as Inspector Andy Trudy, Prue's ex-boyfriend and partner Darryl Morris add the sisters as they struggle to learn the craft and balance they're lives.
