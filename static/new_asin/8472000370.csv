7901112,5,8472000370,"I purchased a number of Miss Patty Cake DVD's when my daughter was 1-2 years old.  She absolutely loved watching them. They engaged her.  There is music, movement, and a wholesome message.  She is 3 1/2 now and watches them less but she absolutely adored them - I had them all memorized myself because she would watch them over and over.  She still sings some of the Miss Patty Cake songs.  Miss Patty Cake DVDs are great.",1181520000,2,422,4.428571428571429
