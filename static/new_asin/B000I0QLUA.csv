2650128,4,B000I0QLUA,"A real New Orleans Soul Music FEST. DVD was made with great care so that every aspect of music, rhythm, orquestras and settings are carefully set in  this DVD by any and all of artists included, I enjoy it very much and recommend it  to any lover of Americas Music Soul.",1203379200,10,270,4.2745098039215685
2650129,4,B000I0QLUA,This is a wonderful dvd.  It brings back so many wonderful memories of New Orleans both musically and visually.  Loved it.,1193011200,,122,4.761904761904762
2650130,5,B000I0QLUA,I loved the music and the scenes of New Orleans were beautiful! The music selection on here is really great.,1177632000,5,108,4.45
2650131,5,B000I0QLUA,"I am a huge fan of Bonnie Rait and Joss Stone. The New Orleans Concert had these two artists and much more. I enjoyed the scenes shown, Blu-Ray only enhanced the concert experience. I would highly recommend this!",1177632000,5,212,4.605263157894737
2650132,4,B000I0QLUA,This is a very nice HD DVD.  The video quality is superb.  The songs are one's that any blues lover will like.  The artists perform well.  The audio quality is very good also.  Overall a very good Concert HD DVD to show to friends to let them see what HD DVD can do.  And its a Benefit DVD!,1170892800,18,290,3.913793103448276
2650133,5,B000I0QLUA,"This DVD is a great mix. It's filmed in a concert setting and the audience noise doesn't interfer with the clarity and sound of the music.  Throughout the concert, there are shots of New Orleans.  Picture quality is very clear.  I was attracted to the performances by Bonnie Raitt, Joss Stone and Keith Richards.",1164844800,5,312,4.7407407407407405
2650134,5,B000I0QLUA,This rocks.  Joss Stone and Bonnie Raitt sound awesome.  The scenes of New Orleans are beautiful.,1160956800,2,97,5.0
2650158,3,B000I0QLUA,"Some nice tunes on this. I only liked about 6 tracks myself but at this price that's ok. Video looks good but audio is Dolby AC3, somewhat of a disappointment. No excuse for not releasing this in Dolby HD & DTS HD formats. That being said the Dolby 5.1 sounds good, Dolby 2.0 loses too much quality and depth for my tastes and the horns are mixed to low at times. If you're into the New Orleans music scene,this should please.",1323129600,8,426,4.271604938271605

2650160,5,B000I0QLUA,"Katrina hit New Orleans folks do not believe in saving the best to the last.  Sultry Irma Thomas quickly introduces the agenda.  No time was wasted bringing on sexy and seductive (I mean the voice) bare-foot Joss Stone.

The money track for me was ""Amazing Grace"" by Aaron Neville, which was a fabulous emotive version.  I would have preferred Aaron Neville sing HIS version a cappella, showcasing his inimitable vocals.  More heart-rending than the recent Oprah endorsed Il Divo version of ""Amazing Grace"".

The back to back grand pianos played by Allen Toussaint and John Cleary on each end is reminiscent of the piano contest in the Movie ""Legend of 1900"".  Awesome sight in 1080p Blu-ray.

Track after track of the blues by legendary performers.  Each a treat.  No slackers tolerated in the company of R&B doyens.  Bonnie Raitt shows off some guitar work, which would have been more remarkable if she were not compared with the many great guitarists performing that evening.  The surprise guest was KEITH RICHARDS singing a Fats Domino classic; his trade-mark guitar work took on a blusey hue.  Unusual for Keith Richards.

There are four good bonus tracks, ending with a manic performance by the Mardi Gras Indians.  Bonus meant bonus, not sub-standard extra footage.

The absence of DTS does not detract from the sound.  Instead of 5.1, I used the 2.0 soundtrack which sounds LPCM to me, and has tight and well-defined bass; essential for a concert well represented by drums and double bass sounds.

All performers pulled their weight.  Excellent, excellent, excellent variety concert BD.",1263340800,9,1594,5.015267175572519
2650161,4,B000I0QLUA,"The New Orleans Concert is one of three blu-ray concert discs I ordered along with my first blu-ray player (the LG BD270) to check out blue-ray technology. As far as audio and picture quality the disc did not disappoint. Blu-ray is truly impressive.

The performers are an ecclectic assembly of old timers, including Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. The concert is good but not particularly exciting. But what will a New Orleans concert be if not a throw back to something.

It took me several hours to figure out how to get the disk to start playing. For this disc it's the ENTER button that does it, not PLAY. Do remember that.",1254355200,,634,4.601769911504425
2650162,2,B000I0QLUA,I own the DVD and when the Blue Ray became available I ordered.  I was surprised because the documentary portion is totally eliminated and much of the music was also left out.  I do not understand why the change but the dvd is better!,1246233600,6,234,4.295454545454546

2650164,3,B000I0QLUA,The New Orleans Concert wasn't as good as I believed it to be with a few talented musician playing and singing unfortunate not long enough for a live concert three and a half out of five .,1240012800,,188,4.108108108108108
2650165,5,B000I0QLUA,"Great music concert in the ""raw"".. some great names, great music and all in all  excellent value for money. I used the HD DVD ""side"" and it is superb. I purchased this ""on spec"" and it proved to be a good decision!",1234656000,,214,4.095238095238095
2650166,5,B000I0QLUA,"These performers on the disc are all incredible, and the whole DVD itself was a lot of fun to watch!  The sound is great, and the picture is even better.  Would highly recommend!",1234483200,,178,4.363636363636363
2650167,4,B000I0QLUA,"(HD-DVD) As with many benefit concerts, this concert was a mixed bag of mostly good, solid performances captured beautifully in hi-def video and superb audio.  There were only 2 or 3 songs I really didn't care for, while most were good to very good.  My favorites were probably I Hear You Knockin', Tipitina, It's Raining, and What Is Success.  Not counting Dirty Man by Joss Stone, which was the best performance of the show.  Her one performance is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.  It is a wonderful performance, an instant classic, and will become one of the top-5 clips you play to show off your home-theater system to guests.",1228089600,,640,4.628318584070796
