7861920,4,6304116470,I enjoyed watching the video. My copy was bought used so the price was cheap. Unless someone collects S & R items and absolutely must have a new copy I'd suggest buying used. I had hoped to see more of an animated version of the stage show in this video. My hope was stomped on my the various mythological characters who dominate the animation. S & R seem to play second fiddle in the whole story. It seems they are there just to give name recognition to this production.,1096416000,,471,4.303370786516854

They save tigers, disappear elephants, facilitate lion births and do wonderful illusions.  Loved it so much - I  bought 3- 2 for gifts!  Thank you S & R.",962841600,,262,4.51063829787234
