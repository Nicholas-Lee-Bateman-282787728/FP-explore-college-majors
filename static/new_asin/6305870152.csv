1085766,5,6305870152,"After waiting sevearl months for ABC's Wonderful World of Disney to air ""Geppetto"", I was very happy to find out that it was going to air May 7, 2000. After I taped the movie off ABC, as to my dismay my VCR did  not record the movie, and I was not able to watch it. Then when  ""Geppetto"" was put on to video I rented it and saw it, the entire  movie completly unedited! It was wonderful all the actors and actresses did  such a wonderful job. Disney did a great job on the casting and the musical  score of ""Geppetto"" was just great. I would ask you to buy and or  rent ""Geppetto"" beacuse if you like and or enjoy musicals or even  DISENEY musicals then this is a movie you are sure to enjoy. By the way,  after you watch why don't you write ABC and The Disney Company and tell  them how much you enjoyed ""Geppetto""!",961804800,,816,4.081761006289308
1085767,5,6305870152,"I never liked Drew Carey much, or Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but after seeing this video I can forgive them both.  Superb in their roles, Drew shows that he actually does have some talent for singing and dancing, and Julia as the  Blue Fairy re-asserts her Broadway talent wonderfully.  Brent Spiner is  entertaining as the hammy villain Stromboli AND the dummies he splits his  personalities with.  Kids and adults would love this alike...my personal  favorite song was ""Just Because it's Magic"" where Drew and Julia  do their best dance work.  And Kudos to the computer effects, especially  the nose growing and Pinnochio turning into a donkey.  This is a video to  enjoy now, and for years to come.",961372800,,695,4.896551724137931
1085768,3,6305870152,"While this is a nice diversion for the children, and features the usual superb Disney productions values (Gepetto's village is a dream version of some Italian side street from a beautiful theme park), it is not among  Disney's best.  Drew Carey exudes much enthusiasm but is simply not up to  the vocal challenge, and Julia Louis Dreyfuss is an odd choice to play the  Blue Fairy.  The makeup on the small wooden boy is frightening and strange;  I think the makeup artists missed the boat on what they might have been  going for.  The contemporary spin on the Pinocchio story often feels  strained to remain PC; Stephen Schwartz is not at the top of his game with  songs that, while engaging within the film, do not remain in your heart or  memory. Still, given the usual dreck produced for children and their  parents, this video is engaging, sweetly conveyed and full of eye-popping  fun for the youngsters.",959558400,2,909,4.713375796178344
1085769,4,6305870152,"A good start to the return to Family film values, but it could have been better. It was ALOT better than I expected. The songs were EXCELLENT, even more so that the theatric Disney films of recent years. The plot was a little bit weak, and at times a bit far fetched even for a Disney Fairy  Tale Story. Drew Carey was a superb singer, although I had trouble at times  finding his acting believible as Gepetto. Julia Louis Dreyfuss was perfect  as the Ditzy Blue Fairy. ...But in closing I have to say that  if the people who made this film continue to stay on this track they'll  eventually get stuff made that WAlt would have been proud of. It should air  EVERY Father's Day as a tradition.",958435200,,692,4.325581395348837
1085770,5,6305870152,This movie was FANTASTIC!  It was one of the best ABC movies ever.  The music is wonderful!  The acting is great.  The costumes are cool!  The scenery is awesome!  And Drew Carey makes a great Geppetto.  Julia  Louis-Drifus is a great actor and makes a great Blue Fairy.  Usher looks  mayjorly fine in the movie!  He is a great dancer and actor and has a nice  body!  This movie is magnificent and should be on again some time.  I  reccomend this to people of all ages because it is interesting how a man  who wants to be a father and finally becomes one turns out to like all of  the other parents.  He just wants Pinochio to be safe.  That's all.,957830400,,648,4.206611570247934
1085771,5,6305870152,"What an enjoyable movie this was.  Not only were the songs staged beautifully (see my review of the CD), but the whole look had that storybook feel that I haven't seen in a long time.  Let's hope this starts  a trend for live-action musicals.  For my friends in the New England area  that saw the review reprinted from a paper from L.A. in the Providence  Journal, I hope you didn't trust the review.  It was way, way off the mark  in every respect.  This movie deserves to be seen again and again!",957830400,,498,4.326086956521739
1085772,5,6305870152,"A very impressive musical.  The songs are top-rate, and the actors surprise fans with their vocal skills.  Brent Spiner and Rene Auberjonois are stand-outs in a solid cast.  Stromboli (Spiner) is a hilarious villian  (with a fantastic singing voice).  Drew Carey and Seth Adkins have real  chemistry as Geppetto and Pinocchio and give very charming performances.  This movie is destined to be classic.",957830400,2,401,5.26984126984127
1085773,5,6305870152,"Disney did a great job with this movie.  Great storyline, great music, great cast.  I think it might be a bit scary for younger children, so I wouldn't let my little one watch it by himself--but certainly it's not any  scarier than any other Disney movie and the heartfelt message outweighs any  drawbacks.  The son-daddy relationship is heartwarming.  This would make a  great father's day gift for meaningful father-son time!",957657600,2,427,5.014285714285714
1085864,4,6305870152,"This came very quickly. I have not opened it. I bought it as part of a Pinocchio- themed basket to raise money for a non-profit. This version of Pinocchio is based on the play, ""My Son Pinocchio.""",1403913600,,196,4.324324324324325
1085865,5,6305870152,"Geppetto is a wonderful new version of the Pinocchio story told by Geppetto himself. The movie is colorful, fast paced, and poignant.",1392681600,,133,5.090909090909091
1085866,5,6305870152,Because it is an excellent movie.drew Carey portrays Geppetto with true conviction. Usher also does an excellent job in this movie.,1390694400,,131,5.285714285714286
1085867,5,6305870152,"I'm not generally a Drew Carey fan, but he did a fantastic job as Geppetto. I didn't know he could sing! I purchased the movie years ago on video, but it took me several years to find it on DVD. Glad I was persistent!",1387238400,,217,3.9545454545454546
1085868,5,6305870152,"I saw this movie years ago and wanted to show it to my daughter who was too young at the time.  If you like Wayne or Drew or Usher, you need to see this movie. Funny and yes, Drew can sing. Really.",1369353600,,197,3.6904761904761907
1085869,5,6305870152,So many of us know this story but certainlly not with this twist. Every parent should view this film. The theme song is also a touching tribute to caring in a family.,1361145600,,166,4.21875
1085870,5,6305870152,"Geppetto is a 2000 Disney live-action, musical retelling of the Pinocchio legend, through the eyes of his father, Geppetto(Drew Carey, Who's Line Is It Anyway?, The Price Is Right). The film is about Geppetto(Carey) being friendly to the children of an Italian village is wishing for a boy, and one night, his wish came true all thanks to the Blue Fairy(Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Seinfeld, The New Adventures of Old Christine) and Pinocchio comes to life. and soon Geppetto learns about being a father. Also, when a evil puppet master(Brent Spiner, Star Trek: Nemesis)hears about Pinocchio, he would do anything go take him from Geppetto. R&B superstar Usher, Rene Auberjonois(Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)and Wayne Brady(Crossover, Let's Make A Deal) also stars in this amazingly delightful family comedy. Although this DVD has no chapter index, or special features, it did little to diminish the quality of this movie. Geppetto is one of the best Disney live-action films to enjoy. :)",1326326400,,979,5.2025316455696204
1085871,5,6305870152,"I love Disney musicals like 'Mary Poppins', 'Pete's Dragon', 'One and Only Genuine Original Family Band', 'The Happiest Millionare' etc. This is definitely one of my favorites.
 Everything about this is wonderful. The focal performance by Drew Carey is sensitive and beautifully done. The rest of the cast, Julia Louis Dreyfuss (hilarious), Rene Auberjonois, Brent Spiner (Star Trek's Data, and boy can he sing) and of course a exhilarating debut by Usher Raymond. The music is beyond reproach. I mean it was written after all by Stephen Schwartz who wrote 'Godspell' and the mega-hit on Broadway 'Wicked'.
  Disney should make more musicals. Music is something Disney has always done best. Not all of us want a steady diet of CGI driven kiddie schlock all the time. Watching FX films is fun, but too much of just one thing always gets boring. For me the real magical effects are in a film's script, performances, and heart.

1085872,5,6305870152,"I remember first watching this movie when I was seven years old...or eight. I did like it, although I did not really understand it (I was a little kid and I never understood movies as a little kid). Now at the age of 14, I got reunited with it. Sadly, I forgot how I did. When I finally recieved the opportunity the watch it for the first united time, I was so impressed and pleased... with everything! The acting, the singing, the music, everything!! Drew Carey, especially, did a fantastic job playing Geppetto. When I first saw him in the film, I was like, ""OH MY GOSH"" For a comedian to play a serious character with a beautiful singing voice, he did a wonderful job. He looked good, too. To see how I feel about him now, you'd think I'd have a crush on him, which of course I don't. And it wasn't just Carey who was fantastic, it was everyone else as well. Julia Louis-Dreyfus better work her voice because she can sing! And Brent Spiner, oh he can DEFINITELY SING!! He is a fantastic opera singer and actor. Did I mention that he has a cool accent? And the famous Pinnochio himself, Seth Adkins; he was wonderful. I really liked that he was chosen to be Pinnochio because he had so much energy and he sounded just like the original Pinnochio himself! And Usher, my buddy, he can really, really sing! The superstar sings like an angel! All of the songs were just incredible, especially the last song, ""Since I Gave My Heart Away"". I felt like crying, but I ended up holding it in. I will admit that I was a little sad...until the happy ending part came. I would recommend this movie to family and friends...and anybody who is willing to open their eyes to the valuable lesson that they can learn from this fantastic experience. All you jealous people and haters out there, let me tell ya'll something. Everyone, including the crew, did a spectacular job with filming this movie. I don't think ya'll have any idea how much effort and work everyone put into this fantastic film. And lastly, don't look at how bad or good a person can sing, if they couldn't sing, then they wouldn't be even be in the musical.",1237680000,2,2111,4.429305912596401
1085873,3,6305870152,"I guess you can save your money and rent it. It is a theatrical loose re-make of animated Pinocchio, sanitized for political correctness. There are very few dances or songs worth mentioning. The scenes of the town with perfect made-to-order children and Pleasure Island are unbearably long. I am not sure what ages this film is targeting: it is hard to develop any affection for the characters, any teachings dilute in the multiple dances and characters.",1194739200,2,454,4.9868421052631575
1085927,3,6305870152,"I love the movie, which is why I bought it, not knowing I couldn't play it on my DVD player. I didn't see or understand afterward the region2, deal. So I have a DVD of a movie I loved, and can't watch it. They will not accept it back as I had opened the package.",1150761600,,262,3.7818181818181817
1085928,4,6305870152,"GEPPETTO is an interesting musical spin on the well-known tale of PINOCCHIO.  Stephen Schwartz delivers a handsome-if average score, with fine performances from Drew Carey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the lead roles.

GEPPETTO wisely doesn't try to emulate Disney's landmark 1940 animation version of PINOCCHIO, but instead retells the tale's events from the perspective of Pinocchio's loving creator and father Geppetto.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays the sparkling and eccentric Blue Fairy, with Seth Adkins as Pinocchio.  Among the supporting cast are Broadway talents Brent Spiner and Ana Gasteyer.  Popular singing star Usher also appears in the ""Pleasure Island"" scene.  Stephen Schwartz provides the score which features the catchy ""Just Because It's Magic"".

Drew Carey (who also served as the Executive Producer) has a warm and winning singing voice, and is just about perfect in the title role.  A great original musical from Disney.",1102723200,4,937,5.549295774647887
1085929,5,6305870152,Me and Krystle arose Christmas morning feeling good and very excited about our presents we continously awoke our parents who were dead asleep and around 6:00 we managed to wake them both and my sister. I first started out soft and I got a neat new soundtrack that I listen to a whole lot next thing I got was Prancer after I hugged that close to my chest and repeated thank you most likely several times I finally reached out for the last of seven presents I was thinking it would be some christmas film but I was T I totally wrong!! I asked Mom where in the world she got it she said she got it at Eckerd's and I think she said that she couldn't find it anywhere else the following day we went to my Grandma's I rushed into her room and quickly shoved the new tape into her VCR and I enjoyed and treasured every moment of this film. My sister Krystle is a very strong fan of Melissa Disney and when she saw her in the numbers Toys & Sasifaction Gurateed she was very happy to see her fave actress dancing and singing. I loved the number Pleasure Island but maybe that is because I loved every song in this film or maybe because that was the only song where I got to see some cute boys run around. I loved the appearance of Josh Sullivan and of course the ever so funny man and talent worthy Wayne Brady. I haven't watched it since Christmas but tonight after my sister falls asleep I want to try it out see if it can help me get some sleep and refresh my memory on the story. Anyway bottom line is it will make you cry and will mostly laugh throughout the whole film so treasure it cause out of all the ABC Wonderful World Of Disney films I've seen I believe that this one has to be the most cutest and heart raising one of them all!,1055376000,,1734,4.102941176470588
1085930,5,6305870152,"Geppetto is the sweetest, best acted movie I've ever seen. I am a HUGE (some call me obsessive) fan of Drew Carey and the talnted Wayne Brady. I watch the Drew Carey show and Whose Line so much, I may actually be turning into a hysterically laughing couch potato. I decided to watch geppetto to see Drew embarass himself. Afterwards, I couldn't believe I had thought he would. I had just seen the most amazing movie. I was surprised by Drew Carey excellent acting skills and voice. Boy, could he sing! I already knew Wayne would be a hit as the magician- he was quite funny. I continued to rent and rerent Geppetto for 2 years afterward. i still am in love with it. This movie is the best ever -- it's so sweet and funny, it gets you up when you're down. i can't live without this beautiful movie...or it's astoundingly talented star!",1026691200,,834,4.422077922077922

1085933,5,6305870152,"This movie, a spin of the children's classic Pinnochio, is a wonderfully touching film that is sure to keep the whole family entertained.  This time the focus is on Pinnochio's father, Geppetto, and what he goes through when  Pinnochio runs away.  The music is stunning and the video is worth buying  just to hear the songs alone.  The story, while inspired by Pinnochio, is  unique and a classic in its own right.
