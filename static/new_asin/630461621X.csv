7874914,5,630461621X,"The Baka Boyz (sic) lead us on a wild ride through the streets and underbelly of the rap world. With guest appearances from big names like Tracy Lee and Big Mike, this ride is paved with platinum bezel. They raise intresting questions like ""what would it be like if in 30 years the president remembered the rap he listened to when he was a youth?"" Obviously you would hear ""who run it Japan?""  This video even gives a sneak peak at how a producer (like Mannie Fresh) can use the beats from an old Nintendo game, whistles, and sparkely sounds to come up with a modern opus.  Inversely, it shows how mearly conjuring up ones spittal can bless a track and make it raw. Of particular note is the section on Christian rap. Even with the omission of famous Christian Rapper 'T-Bone' they manage to make their point (two of them in fact at nine inches a piece). I would highly recomend this video to everyone from the greenest new MC (Lil' Wayne) to the rawest veteran (Juvenile). Make this a part of your library, and one day you may say to yourself, ""I know the soul of the streets.""",976838400,4,1078,4.385
7874915,5,630461621X,I thought this video was pretty cool because it tells you a lot about rap and all the different kinds of rap. It also tells you a bunch of words they use in rap songs you might not have known. It was especially good when they  would show clips from rap videos.,946857600,,260,4.0
7874916,4,630461621X,"I am the writer/producer/director/cameraman for this video.  I had quite a wild 9 weeks working on this project with my buddy Andrew.  I did the best I could with the very low budget available. Click the Suppa Latin composed  7 original groovin tracks for this video, good music mixed with a serious  look at what Rap is, told from the mouths of those currently playing the  game in LA. Haayyyy!  We made good friends over at Power 106 FM in Los  Angeles.  Those folks were very helpful and cool in hookin us up with  interviews.  The best thing about this video is it's structure.  It is  non-racial, very comprehensive in it's perspective on the Rap Artists  lifestyle.  Even Christian Rap is looked at in this video.  We also  interview Music Video directors, Record Label executives, Rap radio DJ's,  Rap Sheet and other Rap music industry experts.  My personal favorite  section of the video is the Rap Slang segment with the freestyle master  Rapper Prince Whipper Whip!  During this segment, notice the 'Blunt' smoke  blowing towards Whip from the camera.  That was me, blending in with my  subjects, a key factor in quality journalism!  Anyway, what do you think of  the video?  Peace for now!  Dale Dreher",924393600,,1214,4.762135922330097
