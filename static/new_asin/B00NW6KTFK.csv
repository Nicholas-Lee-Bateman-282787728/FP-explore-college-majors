6682198,5,B00NW6KTFK,"Alistair Bruce, historian and expert on royal customs, provides lessons in etiquette in the British Edwardian Age in this one hour Masterpiece film.  Many of the actors from Downton talk candidly - it's fun to see how different some are from their characters in real life. Some of the actors featured include: Hugh Bonneville, Michelle Dockery, Elizabeth McGovern, Laura Carmichael, Joanne Froggatt, Brendan Coyle, and Sophie McShera among others.

In an interview in the Daily Mail, Bruce says he tells the actors to imagine a telephone line is there to keep them from getting too close as people were more distant physically in the Edwardian Age and not so 'huggy'. He says, ""'I'm always trying to stop people hugging,' he exclaims. 'We've become so physically expressive as people - it's a miracle we're ever unclamped from each other frankly, and the actors are very keen on it - but it's just not the language of this period.""

He has to remind Lady Mary not to slouch when her grandmother is around, advise Lady Edith to take her gloves off the table after dinner, and tell Earl Grantham to keep his hands out of his pockets.  It just wasn't done back then.  Bruce has acted in Downton himself as a butler to the Dowager Duchess,  a Staff Colonel accompanying a General visiting the home, and he even played the Lord Chamberlain to King George V at Court when Lady Rose was presented to royalty. This role allowed him to oversee the royal rituals. Now that you know his face, you can see where he will pop up next. The actors call him 'the Oracle' for his vast knowledge. Interestingly, even Queen Elizabeth relies upon Bruce when he persuaded her to wear her 'full regalia' for an outdoors shoot at Balmoral for her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.

One amusing quote from an interview with the Daily Mail, Bruce says the actors from Downton Abbey wanted to relax the etiquette a bit as the seasons progress through time. It's 1924 in the fifth season - does everything have to still be so formal?  Bruce describes: 'They were saying, ""Oh Alastair we're in the fifth series, can I relax a bit?"" To which I told them, ""You can relax a bit in about 1955"".'

We can only hope Downton Abbey lasts until the 1950's.

If you like social history, the time period of Downton, or write historical fiction of this time period, you will find the topics of interest. Found it fascinating to see what an actual set looks like with all of the camera equipment and staff on hand for a simple scene. If you are a Downton fan, think you will enjoy the content in this film.",1420934400,63,2555,4.595604395604395
6682199,5,B00NW6KTFK,"***NOTE: This program was not included in the Season 5 release of Downton Abbey though it aired on PBS during the same time frame.  US viewers must purchase it separately unless they release it in the future as a combined multi-season group.

""If I should search for logic, I would not look for it among the English upper class"" -- Violet Crowley, D-Countess of Grantham

At just one hour run time, one shouldn't expect this program to offer a complete guide to acting like an aristocrat.  However, it does offer some fairly nice detail that illustrates the complexity of Edwardian age manners vs. a world beginning to modernize.  It is hosted by Alastair Bruce, historic adviser to the production.  Yes, he is also of the famous family line Bruce.  Here are all the main topics with just a few highlights of what was discussed in each:

HOW TO EAT:  ""Nothing succeeds like excess"" -- Ritual of the Dinning Room -- Setting the Table -- Service Procedure -- Table Conversation -- and we thought a 6 place setting was complicated.  Try 6 spoons just to start with!  One might think the intricacy of the table would be boring, but this ballet of table service was amazing.  Not designed to teach you to set your table though.

HOW TO MARRY:  Coming Out in Society -- The Season -- Lineage & Burk's Peerage (Posh Bible of lineage) -- Aristocrat Courtship -- Staff Courtship

HOW TO BEHAVE:  Social Etiquette -- Cool Reserve & Manners to Protect Position -- Manners of Staff -- The mention of how the French Revolution affected British Aristocratic Behavior (to protect position) was quite interesting, though brief.

HOW TO DRESS:  Dressing to Make a Statement (I don't work, people help me dress, I am in charge) -- Tiaras and Gloves

HOW TO MAKE MONEY:  Old Money (and the failure of the old way) -- New Money -- Knowing Your Place -- Stewardship of the Aristocrat for his land and tenants

This program uses scenes from the show and behind the scenes footage, almost exclusively, as Alastair discusses the various topics.  With only a one hour run, there was the obvious danger of being superficial, useless or trite.  However, I thought the goals were very well defined and ultimately realized.  It's detailed just enough to drive the point home.  It makes you feel the complexity of that world without having to explain every detail.  I was also struck with how many choice one-liners Maggie Smith is given in the show, like when she asks awkwardly ""What is a week-end?""  Those quotes are replayed frequently in this documentary, and it's great!

I really enjoyed this program and highly recommend it.  As I mentioned, it was not included as an extra in the U.S. Season 5 Release.  I do think it will be included in a ""Complete Series box set"" some day, but I doubt most people will wait.  If you are buying the Region 2 Season 5 direct from the UK, then I can tell you it's already on that set.",1417478400,115,2896,4.630648330058939

The most worthless part is the ""How to make a Dress"" segment (more on restoring/maintaining a1920's original than on making one) and even that is worth watching. You'll also be shown a clip of Michelle Dockery wearing the dress in one episode. Several cast members (Dockery as often as any I think) talk about their roles and what they've learned, I find that they almost always look a little different in modern day hair, clothing stylessome of them sound different different too.

6682293,4,B00NW6KTFK,"Enjoyable to watch, but Downton Abbey is not set in Edwardian England.  I could be mistaken, but I thought Edwardian times refers to King Edward the VII's reign, which ended before the start of WWI.  I find it curious then that this DVD keeps referring to the ettiquette & manners of the Edwardians, when the Downton Abbey series begins with the sinking of the Titanic, which happended after King Edward VII's death.  Even if you count WWI as still being Edwardian, this means that this period ended after season 2.  Season 3 begins in 1920.  To my mind, the 1920's are not considered Edwardian times.  Perhaps this DVD keeps referring to the Edwardians because the people who were in the Edwardian times were still observing the same customs well into the 1920's.  Regardless of what is technically considered the end of the Edwardian era, this DVD is a must for those who are interested in the customs of the English aristocracy.",1428796800,,931,4.745341614906832

6682299,3,B00NW6KTFK,"Alastair Bruce, historical advisor to ""Downton Abbey"" proves himself to be a lively and engaging on-camera personality in his own right as he takes us through some of the areas of Edwardian etiquette which he is responsible for overseeing to prevent our actors from doing something gauchely 21st century in their deportment.  Bruce also reads the scripts for accuracy in historical detail and period manners and speech, as well as advising the makeup and hair department and the set designers.  Cast and crew alike refer to him as ""The Oracle"" (the legend on the back of his on-set chair), and acknowledge his invaluable assistance in the creation of the program, where he really is on hand every day, just out of frame, critiquing every scene and sometimes participating as an actor.  Alastair is an entertaining host, but be advised that this mini-documentary is a scant 60 minutes long, and is largely comprised of recycled clips from seasons 4 and 5.  It would have been lovely as a bonus feature to Season 5, but at this run time, I think the price is grossly overinflated and rented it from my public library instead.  Even at a sale price, it runs as much as a full three-disc season set of the series.  It could have been fleshed out a great deal more to justify the price.",1427673600,14,1281,4.696428571428571

6682324,5,B00NW6KTFK,It was so interesting to read and watch just how they lived back in those days.  The historian that is in charge is so informed in the history of this period that it really held my attention.  It was truly amazing for me.  I am so into Downton Abbey and maybe that is the ultimate reason I sought more of the history of this.  The history of the castle was interesting as well.  I loved learning that a lot of the dresses are actually vintage dresses from that time period and are being restored to be used for the show.  I so enjoyed watching and learning but am so very glad I live in my time period - it is much less formal for all involved.,1424131200,,644,4.071428571428571
