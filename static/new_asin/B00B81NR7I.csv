5562534,1,B00B81NR7I,"I could barely watch this movie knowing full well that this movie was awful. If it tells you anything about the quality of the movie the box art probably has more production value than the entire movie. What I watched of the movie was on par with 80's and 90's home movies. Do not watch unless you really like horribly cheesy ninja movies. I think there are ninjas in this movie. There was a sword fight at the beginning and then some other stuff happened, and then I turned it off.",1387670400,5,482,4.3076923076923075

5562540,4,B00B81NR7I,"I love the Story and the little bits of humor that was place in it. I will not lie the first 5 mins did not interest me at all and felt like it was going to be a real bad movie, but I feel like it would be a small cult classic if given chance.",1456790400,,243,3.4363636363636365

5562542,1,B00B81NR7I,Campy at best.  The description makes it out to be a action film yet it's just a silly comedy. Barely made it 30 minutes before I shut it off.,1444176000,,142,3.896551724137931

5562552,4,B00B81NR7I,"It's not a $100M action flick, but it is a good comedy, and well done for the genre and budget.  While it may be stylized, it is good acting, a good director, and a humorous take on an old storyline.",1413244800,2,199,3.975

5562555,4,B00B81NR7I,"Not a bad movie if you understand Japanese style movies. This is by no means a Hit Movie, sold millions of copies type movies; but understand the styling and you'll enjoy it. It's meant to be ""cute"" yet ""serious"" at the same time. Two things that usually don't measure up together. This movie will not please many Western culture movie watchers, but definitely worth the open mind.",1408752000,3,381,4.701492537313433

5562557,2,B00B81NR7I,The only reason I watched the whole movie is because I found it kinda funny since it reminds me of anime. The movie though when referring to it's quality is poor.,1406419200,,162,4.258064516129032

5562561,4,B00B81NR7I,"If your only into the serious Japanese Martial Arts then need not watch this particular movie. But, is you understand a little of the Japanese Ninja, Yakuza and Samurai culture and honor system within each and you like a little humor along the way then you will enjoy this movie. The blending of the culture and different times was enjoyable.",1403654400,2,342,4.716666666666667
5562562,4,B00B81NR7I,"As a Japanese American, who can speak Japanese, I  thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was a typical Japanese action comedy. I can understand why other reviewers who may not understand Japanese humor would dislike this. If you're expecting a serious ninja action movie, it's not for you. Think more along the lines of ""Kung Fu Hustle.""",1400198400,2,333,4.946428571428571
5562563,4,B00B81NR7I,"Ok, if you're expecting the normal or average film format I warn you that you won't find that here. If you're looking for something funny to laugh at, then I highly recommend this movie because it shouldn't be taken too seriously. My friends and I had just finished watching alot of serious, sad movies over the weekend so at the moment we needed a good laugh and something to lift us up. Curiosity enticed us to watch this movie and we were laughing to tears. The story involves a battle to the death of two ninja kings. There can only be one. One ninja who is defeated and left for dead is taken in by a jolly yakuza family. They nurse him back to health and too our surprise a change happens. I encourage everyone to watch this movie. At the very least you will smile.",1399766400,2,771,4.287671232876712
5562564,1,B00B81NR7I,pressed the buy now on accident. watched like 5 minutes and it wasn't intresting. so i didn't even bother to watch the whole thing.,1396915200,,131,4.5
5562565,3,B00B81NR7I,"Least amount of almost fights, about three. Interesting culture examples throughout. Female ninja's goal is never sure but I think she wants the clan all to herself",1396310400,,164,5.111111111111111

badly acted

bad in every way
crap, crap, crap, is this enough words yet, why yes",1393632000,,102,4.15
5562569,1,B00B81NR7I,I would have rated this half a star if that choice was available.  This movie has got to be one of the worst I have seen and I can never get back that 1+ hour of my life watching this movie.,1392940800,,190,3.6341463414634148

5562571,3,B00B81NR7I,"Very campy for most of the film, the picture and sound remind me a lot of a soap opera...  Heck the acting reminds me of a soap opera, but one that doesn't really take itself very seriously.  It's intentionally comedic and as long as you can accept that, you'll like it.",1390953600,,270,4.2745098039215685
5562572,5,B00B81NR7I,"So many of people rated the low feedback, I was like: ""how bad could it be?"" But still it wasn't that bad.  The thing is that its not a multi-million-dollar show for special effects and fake graphics added to the scenes and people!  It is done with natural skills performing the stunts and acting it out just in front of the camera.  Some instances were humorous and there were hardcore ones too. Well it goes into similarity with the other Japanese 'anime' style stories; nothing too abstract at the story-line but it wasn't boring since actors did their role OK for the most part.  But you could tell it was stunts because in one scene the guy could have chopped the other guys fingers off easy but he did not for some reason so it was fake.

I would still recommend this movie to people want to watch an 'anime' style action-oriented movie that is recorded in a life-like footage style.",1390694400,,889,4.496894409937888
5562573,2,B00B81NR7I,"So I picked this movie because it looked sad and lonely on Amazon Instant Watch and... well, I am pumped that I did because this my first experience with live-action anime.

Previous reviewers have said this movie is terrible and sure, by some sort of vague standard of ""good"" vs ""bad"" this movie is not exactly in the realm of watchable but you have to give it credit because it is the very first of its kind.  After a few short minutes I realized that this movie was the beginning of a new genre.  It's live-action anime.  If you imagine the characters with impossibly large eyes then you'll see what I mean.  This movie has all the makings of an animated feature: the ninja, the sumo wrestler, the girl with an impossibly high voice, the guy with long hair and a bad attitude.  This is a manga brought to life.

In all seriousness, I sat through this for 20 minutes and except for the anime reference I saw nothing that conveyed entertainment to me.  We have a sarcastic 12-year-old boy in the house who I might show it to just for the purposes of making fun of it but aside from that it's complete garbage.  The fight scenes are an insult to human intelligence and the plot, whatever it might happen to be, is beyond comprehension.  Take the advice of all the 1-star reviewers and move on to the video of the fireplace or something.  That, at least, would make some sense.",1389830400,2,1376,4.420634920634921
