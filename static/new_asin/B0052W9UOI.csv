4531691,5,B0052W9UOI,"This is a great new Wiggles DVD.  There are so many wonderful new songs...including, Everyone Loves A Puppy, Henry's Spinning, ect.  Sam's voice is beautiful on this DVD and my favorite songs include Cluck Cluck City, Hawaiian Boogie, Hula Hula Baby, Toy Box, When I'm Painting, The Good Ship Fabulous Flea...but my #1 favorite is one that Anthony does called Ooki, Ooki, Ooki, Hear That Old Bouzouki.  This DVD features many songs about the things children love...dogs, toys, dolls, painting, ect.
It was such a big hit in our home, that we went out and bought our son a Ukelele a week after purchasing. If you love the Wiggles, this one is for you.  Sure, it's different from the others...but what fun would life be if everything was the same all the time?  One of the things I love about the Wiggles is their variety and the fact that they introduce so many styles of music from all around the world.

If you love the Wiggles, YOU MUST MUST MUST purchase this awesome DVD.  Rolf Harris even returns for a wonderful song and also Al Roker in the song, Thank You Mr. Weatherman. This one is a winner!!!!  Great job Wiggles!",1313625600,2,1124,4.557213930348259
4531692,2,B0052W9UOI,"My two and a half year old daughter absolutely ADORES the Wiggles.  She has all the singing dolls, tons of their CDs & DVDs, won't go to sleep without Henry the Octopus, and had a blast at their concert this summer.  I pre-ordered this new release and got it about a week ago.  We have tried to watch it several times, but it does not hold her attention at all!  Actually, she practically falls asleep.  The only ""catchy tune"" on this one is ""Hula, Hula Baby"".

The Wiggles should be commended for their attempt to introduce children to various instruments from around the world including the Ukele and the Greek Bouzouki as well as the music of Puccini, however, this one fell flat for our Wiggle's Loving Tot.  The songs do not relate to things in a toddlers world.  If they wanted to go with a beach theme they would have been better off with simple ideas such as waves and sand while sticking to their signature repetitive tunes that toddlers love so much.

Sorry, but this one is not a winner.",1313625600,8,998,4.43956043956044
4531693,5,B0052W9UOI,"We received this dvd a week ago when it came out. The tunes are so catchy that we can't get them out of our heads! This is the only dvd that my toddler wants to watch. All songs are good esp. Ukulele Baby, Hula Hula baby, and How many fingers do you see. Definetly recommend this dvd!",1313280000,,284,4.0
4531694,5,B0052W9UOI,"Ukulele Baby is another great Wiggles addition.  It includes one of the new Wiggles members, Simon Pryce as ""Ringo the Ringmaster"", and while his part is small, I thought he was great, and I'm looking forward to the new group lineup.

The songs on this DVD are mellow (given the prominence of the ukulele instrument), but up-tempo enough to keep my 1-year old watching.  I don't mind having a few of these songs stuck in my head the next day...they're definitely not annoying, as some children's music tends to be.  This DVD had to grow on me over time, but it has become one of my favorites.

5 stars for Ukulele Baby!",1354665600,,619,4.491071428571429
4531695,2,B0052W9UOI,I have four other Wiggles videos and this is by far the most boring video we own. It doesn't hold my 15 month olds attention at all. :(,1332633600,,135,3.857142857142857
4531696,4,B0052W9UOI,"Very good, new songs, not the same old ones you find on the tv shows.  Plus a cameo by Al Roker.  My 2 yr old loves it and I recommend this dvd.",1329091200,,144,3.46875
4531697,5,B0052W9UOI,We've listened to a lot of Wiggles around our house for 6 years now.  This is their best album yet.  The songs are catchy and fun.  The sound of Sam and Ringo make it wonderful.  The Wiggles have made a big mistake getting rid of Sam.  He added a lot of musical talent to the group.  We won't be buying anything new from the Wiggles.,1327968000,,333,4.046153846153846
4531698,3,B0052W9UOI,Not one of the great Wiggles productions.  Has a studio feel to it.  Hard for the kids to dance to.  Lots of the same characters.  A familiarity with the other Wiggles offerings is a big plus.  Interesting to see a few more of the Field family members onscreen.,1326326400,,261,4.354166666666667
4531699,5,B0052W9UOI,Love this DVD! My 2 year old loves to dance to the music and I do too! Very catchy songs that you will find yourself singing.,1326067200,,125,3.8461538461538463
4531700,5,B0052W9UOI,"Ukulele Baby is a cute and adorable movie even though this title role hardly appears during the title credits.  I really love the paradise of Hawaii, and one of my favorite songs is ""When I Strum My Ukulele"" sung by Murray, my second favorite wiggle... and ""The Good Ship Fabulous Flea"" featuring Rolf Harris from Wiggly, Wiggly World.

I'm glad about Al Roker the Guest Starring Orange Wiggle playing the part of a weather man and Ringo the Ringmaster along with Captain Feathersword joining in with the Wiggles and some kids for a song, ""I'm Waving to You""  My favorite part is when Anthony, his wife and daughters dance the ballet.",1325808000,,634,4.693693693693693
4531701,5,B0052W9UOI,How can you not love the wiggles! This is a wonderful item for all who love the Wiggles and the parents who have to listen to them!!,1325462400,,132,3.925925925925926
4531702,3,B0052W9UOI,All my granddaughters love this video.  I was glad I found it @ Amazon.  Not in stores.  It made the road trip a little more bearable.,1315872000,,134,4.076923076923077
4531703,4,B0052W9UOI,"Their videos are going downhill. They're not nearly as fun, catchy, or entertaining as they used to be. The last 2 Live shows (this year and last year) weren't quite as catchy as the previous years either, but that's just our opinion, our kids LOVED it of course, and they adore this movie, especially since Ringo (Simon Pryce) is in it! We still love them, we realize they're all gettin older, but we wouldn't mind them taking a little longer putting stuff together. It'd be worth the wait!",1313798400,2,491,4.590909090909091

8454539,5,B0052W9UOI,We love this DVD. It has such great toddler Wiggles dancing music that the parents love so much. We don't mind our 3 yr old don wanting to play it over and over.,1389484800,,161,3.909090909090909
8454540,5,B0052W9UOI,"I usually don't write reviews unless the products are absolutely worthwhile to write about and so good, I can't contain myself.  This is one of those.  I've purchased many of The Wiggles DVDs after discovering them from a loan at the local library when my grandson was still an infant.  He loved it so much, so I started buying one at a time and I just purchased this one recently.  The music is so wonderful from the beginning, the choreography in each song is absolutely fabulous with new characters and dancers.  Al Roker is a nice addition to this DVD.  I love the music so much, I am thinking about putting the DVD in so I can listen to the music even when my grandson is not around.",1378425600,2,688,4.3359375
8454541,5,B0052W9UOI,"I almost didn't buy this dvd because of the reviews saying it's boring.  My kids and I love Sam's voice and this does showcase his voice well, especially in Henry's spinning song.  One of our favorite numbers has to be Hula Hula Baby.  It was great to hear the dancers sing for a change, and they are really talented singers, and all the while they sing they are doing hoola hooping.  Very impressive.  One of the best instrumentals was O Mio Babbino Caro and the musicians were wonderful.  It was a little disappointing that Dorothy the Dinosaur couldn't sing the melody but the musicians made up for it.  The songs are catchy and who can ever get tired of Sam's lovely voice?",1374364800,3,677,4.5
8454542,5,B0052W9UOI,My toddler would watch this over and over and over and over. . . again.  He was a die hard Wiggles fan at one point. Ukulele Baby was very enjoyable to him. We have the DVD and CD.,1365033600,,180,3.736842105263158
8454543,5,B0052W9UOI,My grand daughter just loves the Wiggles.  Dances and claps to every song.  She get so excited when we put on the DVD,1362355200,,117,4.043478260869565
