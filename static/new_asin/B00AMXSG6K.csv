8554405,1,B00AMXSG6K,"This is the worst dvd I have ever bought, the quality is disgusting, in fact it looks like it has been filmed from a screen, not an official music dvd, I am very untrusting in buying more product from the some source.",1401840000,,217,4.190476190476191
8554406,1,B00AMXSG6K,"This Dvd is very poor quality. The sound was ""tinny"" and the visual was blurred.
I love Katy Perry but this was just disappointing.",1390780800,,131,4.5
8554407,4,B00AMXSG6K,"I would have given this DVD 5 stars, but the picture quality is poor. The bounse songs are a 5 star great quality. I am glad I bought this dvd and enjoyed watching & listening to the concert. I will keep mine because it still is worth seeing.",1379548800,,242,4.0625
8554408,1,B00AMXSG6K,"The quality of picture is extremely poor. It looks like a bootleg version, in stark contrast to the HD stylized production of ""Part of Me"".  I will return this DVD to the seller.",1376524800,,178,4.393939393939394
8554409,3,B00AMXSG6K,"Katy's full concert from Rio 2011 + 3 bonus live songs. Katy put on a great show at this concert in Rio which was broadcast in crystal clear HD. Unfortunately this release is a poor quality copy of the show which is really a shame since its available easily and much better quality all over the internet.

The picture is blurry,not crisp or sharp at all. Imagine the difference between a VHS and DVD and this would be the VHS. Again,this was broadcast in HIGH DEFINITION. The 3 bonus live tracks (doesn't say where they are from) are much better quality than the Rio footage.

It does appear to be a pressed DVD and not a DVD-r but the back cover is very amateurish and the poor quality video lead me to believe this is a bootleg release.
I would give this 5 stars if they just used a better print which would have been simple and its a shame they didn't.",1376006400,2,855,4.271604938271605
8554410,5,B00AMXSG6K,"Katy was very, very good!  Her show there, tops the shhows she does here, even though she sings the same songs, they were presented in a little different manner!  Very good, get it!!!",1372118400,,183,4.515151515151516
8554411,5,B00AMXSG6K,"I am a super big Katy Perry fan, and I went to her concert here in Chicago, and this one was in Rio, and it was a little different, but I enjoyed almost as when we saw her in person!!!  She is good, funny, and talented, and if you have or have not seen one of Katy's concerts, you'll enjoy this concert, because it is a little different that she had in Chicago.  She had about 100,000 people in the audience.  It was a packed theater that was huge.  Katy's concert in Chicago was a a little more personal, and I liked it better, but you 'll enjoy this DVD if you buy it.  I watched it today, and I love it.!!  Katy Perry is the BEST!!!!",1370736000,,636,3.968503937007874
