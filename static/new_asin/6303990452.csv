750486,1,6303990452,"This movie could be one of the worst I've ever seen.  The acting is formulaic, the action and story are too.  The only difference between this  movie and other ""action"" movies is this one takes place with  pirates and on ships.  Some of the scenes are beyond laughable (for  instance, Geena Davis, in one scene, outruns a team of horses while jumping  through windows, dodging obstacles and leaping out another window).  If you  are aged 10-13, you might like it, otherwise consider yourselves warned.  Oh, and the ""bad-guy death"" scene is the funniest thing I ever  saw, but wasn't supposed to be.",941414400,5,598,4.764705882352941
750487,3,6303990452,"Cutthroat Island had lots of potential, but didn't quite live up to it.  Not that the movie is bad.  It's just that some of the acting was  disappointing.  For the first half of the movie, Geena Davis' character,  Morgan was kind of unbelievable.  However, Frank Langella's portrayal of  the villain, Dog, was nothing short of spectacular.  Awesome sets and  beautiful costumes make this movie a must see for any pirate fan!",926294400,5,424,4.859154929577465

750767,3,6303990452,"If you need a pirate movie fix and you're sick of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise then this is a good way to go. Geena Davis gives it her all, and frank Langella makes for his usual fantastic campy villain self. The script is hit and miss but honestly I think it's unfair to judge something like this too harshly. The locations are stunning and it's beautifully filmed. I think that Matthew Modine however is the weakest link in the movie. He's a very talented actor, but perhaps not a leading man in a pirate movie. All in all it's a pretty entertaining movie.",1503100800,,568,4.419047619047619

My main issue wasn't the movie, action shots...lame some, others good, but  THE ANNOYING BACKGROUND MUSIC and fake sounds added to the fight scenes.

750820,5,6303990452,"OK, wandered over to Amazon Prime when Netflix went down and decided to give this a try. Sure, there are a few problems, but this is the perfect movie for a lazy weekend afternoon. Its a simple typical pirate story line and the dialog does tend to get corny and drag at times, but picks up. The score is appropriately nautical although at times a trifle overpowering. Lots of realistic fights scenes and fantastic explosions. The first major chase with the carriage is FUN, involving lots of leaping, somersaults and running across buildings, interspersed with punches, kicks and sword play. Langella is wonderful as the evil uncle and who doesnt adore Shayna? The ending is superb: Bad Dog. BOOM! My one pet peeve as a biologist: when Langella squeezes a spider to death, gobs of red blood drip down his fingers. Spiders don't have red blood  it is hemolymph, which is pale blue to blue/green.",1500163200,2,894,4.767741935483871

750822,3,6303990452,"Before the Pirates of the Caribbean series made pirates fashionable again, this light, comic adventure film put its best foot forward back in 1995. Plagued by production controversies, advance negative buzz and an overcrowded Christmas release, Cutthroat Island was dismissed as a colossal failure earning $10 million against a reported budget of $98 million. But, what does any of that mean to an audience looking to be entertained? Hopefully, after all the dust and drama have long since settled, very little. On its own terms, for its modest (albeit lavish) goals, Cutthroat Island is just a fun picture.  Light on plot, high on adventure, the movie concerns a blood feud between pirate Morgan Adams (Geena Davis) and her villainous Uncle Dawg (Frank Langella) as they battle on the high seas to secure three parts of a lost treasure map. What follows is simply a series of high energy action set pieces and good practical effects in service of that aim. The scale is the thing, not the play. Director Renny Harlin (""Cliffhanger"" ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"") is a filmmaker prone to spectacle and size with action writ very large. He traffics in the sound and fury lane much like Michael Bay. So you won't find subtlety or nuance here. But, you will find joy in the filmmaking, some moments of awe, induced silly grins and a nostalgia for pre-digital, high concept entertainments. If anything, Cutthroat Island is better than its reputation. And the ships and sets are real.",1499644800,,1475,4.94758064516129
750823,3,6303990452,All in all the action was okay. The ship exploding was pretty cool. The acting was horrible as was the dialogue. Probably the worst writing ever in a movie. Some nonsensical plot devices and lack of continuity too.,1499558400,,214,4.657894736842105

750998,4,6303990452,I have wanted to see this for a long time as I missed it when it first came out and avoid watching it when I catch it half-way through on TV.  I enjoyed it despite all of the negative reviews it has gathered over the years.  Frank Langella steals the show as the villain.  My only complaint is the lack of special features.  Not even a dialog track with the director...  just a trailer.  Geena Davis appears to do many of her own stunts and is quite the athlete.  Now I understand how she actually thought she could compete in the Olympics in archery.,1474934400,4,551,4.240384615384615

I'm a fan of classic swashbuckling, from Doug Fairbanks to Errol Flynn and beyond, and certainly see Geena Davis as a worthy member of that swashbuckling society. The plot is no more ridiculous than any other great pirate film. It has some expected elements (the monkey, the jolly roger, an attack on Port Royale) and it adds a few creative elements of its own, such as the three-part map. The romantic angle works with Matthew Modine and Frank Langella is an superb villain.  This movie had a reputation for being one of the biggest flops ever, but that was less about the film and more about poor money management by the production and direction team.

Geena Davis, Mathew Modine and Frank Langella hand us wonderful performances throughout the entire film along with a great story line and plot. Also awesome supporting actors!
Morgan Adams' father's dying gifts to her are his pirate ship and a one-third part of a map of a treasure island - unusually inscribed on his scalp. Thinking herself in need of a Latin scholar to unravel the map, she buys learned slave William Shaw and sets off in search of the rest of the map. However, it is Shaw, obviously with plans of his own, who gets the second part. He's somewhat easier to deal with, though, than the holder of the last part - Morgan's less-than-loving piratical uncle Dawg.",1442707200,,783,4.807407407407408
751828,3,6303990452,"Executive Summary: This movie is well-funded camp. Nice sets. Good soundtrack. Mediocre acting. Simple plot. Spastic screen writing.

This is such an odd movie. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. There are some nicely quipped one-liners and good action sequences. The acting is ok, if a bit stiffly delivered. The part where it really fails, however, is the screenwriting. The writers had a lousy sense of pacing. Even with all the action sequences, the movie just seems to plod it's way through. To give a rough comparison, it's like hearing your favorite song off in the distance. You know the rhythm and you want to jam to it, but the sound is too soft for you to really get into it. The other issue was the fact that the writers couldn't seem to make up their mind if they were going for comedy or epic. If it had been written as out-and-out comedy, it would have worked and probably turned out like the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Unfortunately, a lot of the comedy felt mellowed as if to make sure the audience didn't forget the epic bit of it. As if to make sure we didn't have too many laughs because we might for get the GRANDNESS of the tale, as it were. It was really unfortunate because in not doing one or the other, they fell flat on both counts.

Oddly enough, this is the only movie where I can say my absolute favorite thing about it was the score. It is a classically done score.  It's understated, but has a very distinctive theme that would have perfectly matched the tone of the movie if the screenwriters had done a better job of pacing.

Bottom Line: I can enjoy watching this movie once in a blue moon when I'm in the mood for something light, but I can't watch it more than that. There's a few good quips to laugh at and fight scenes to enjoy, but it's just not an adventure. It's what you would get if you fed an adventure flick hash brownies. All the mannerism and traits of an adventure are there, but it's sort of mellow doing and occasionally being amusing.",1442534400,2,2007,4.387096774193548

752179,5,6303990452,"This is one of my favorite 'modern' pirate movies. To me, it heralds back to the classic pirate movies from the 1940's and 1950's, of which I could not get enough of when I was growing up. I would wait for those Saturday Afternoons in the 1970's when the local TV station where I grew up had the classic movie matinees on TV and would play 2 classic movies in the afternoon from noon - 4pm and perhaps some classic filler cartoons if the movies were to 2 hours in length even with the commercials.
Many afternoons were crime drama classic movies, but every once in awhile they would have the pirate movies, such as Captain Blood with Errol Flynn, Captain Kidd, The Sea Hawk, Black Beard, and many others.

For me, at least, Cutthroat Island captured the essence of the classic pirate movies through modern story telling. From the sword fights to the ship battle scenes, this is one of my favorite pirate movies.

And while Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean was good. I really enjoy Cutthroat Island better. No ghosts, no curses, just a great story with high seas action and battles.

I should also note  that I watched this in the theaters when it came out, and I went 3 times! I still enjoy watching it as much as the first time when I saw it.",1433635200,5,1244,4.419213973799127

There is at least some sexuality (unlike one review stated), a brief boob groping incident, but not much else besides kissing.  Also some of the action scenes cut around too quickly.

I had worked in a maritime library/research center and the staff there just roll their eyes and pronounce it to be the worst ever film. However, I just love this film. A very exciting film, and an escapist fantasy adventure with a lady pirate. I think Geena Davis did an excellent performance, even though she is better known for comedies. Also I am fan of all of her films and have most of them on tape. Her image as a lady pirate is too enticing to pass up. Excellent film, I say, even though the critic in the local paper at the time it came out loathed it, hated it, could not stop stomping on it. I love it. I found it breath-taking and marvelous. The plot is not logical, but that doesn't matter. The characters survive stunts that would kill real people, but isn't fantasy supposed to deliver such things? A wondrous escapist film in which villains act villainously for no reason, in which there is little dialogue, and just action, action! There is character development. The audience does learn more about Morgan Adams and learns to care about her as a hero fighting rivals. The character of Shaw -- a thief pretending to be a doctor -- grows to be a serious person. He learns loyalty and trust and he gets the girl in the end. Yes, the film is superficial but so what? It is a fun film. Perhaps it is seen as mindless, useless trash by some, I found it to be great entertainment.

752390,3,6303990452,"OK pirate movie, filmed almost a decade before ""The Pirates of The Caribbean"" craze, back when the idea of a big budget pirate movie was practically unheard of and rightfully thought to be box office poison. This movie ticks off all the boxes of required elements for a pirate film, with the odd exception of substituting the traditional comedy relief parrot with a 'cute' little monkey that constantly mugs for the camera. *Ugh* CUTTHROAT ISLAND starts out well enough, then gets quite draggy through the middle (my thumb hovered over the FF>> button a few times, but never pressed it), then shifts gears and is somewhat redeemed by an energetic, thundering finale as the good guys & bad guys clash over the obligatory buried treasure in a ferocious sea battle, .

Geena Davis appears bored most of the time, unenthusiastically delivering some really wooden dialogue. Her lead role as the daughter of a legendary pirate, who must now lead her late father's ragtag crew of scurvy knaves into battle to recover the old fart's hidden treasure just rings hollow and smacks of her then-husband (director Renny Harlin) doing his damnedest to try and mold is then-wife into an action superstar. (Harlin gave Davis another shot in the following year's mediocre ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" with more or less the same lackluster results.) A roguishly charming Matthew Modine does his best impression of Cary Elwes/Westley/Dread Pirate Roberts from ""The Princess Bride,"" while Frank Langella channels his overly hammy 'Skeletor' performance from ""Masters of The Universe"" to inform his lamely-monikered evil pirate role as 'Dawg.' And keep a look out for a very young Christopher Masterson (oldest brother 'Francis' on Fox TV's ""Malcolm In The Middle"") as 'Bowen' the ship's gopher on Geena's pirate galleon, The Morning Star.

Overall, the film is more or less technically sound and as I mentioned earlier the climax features an impressively mounted, staged & filmed sea battle: plenty of swords clanging, cannons booming, timbers shivering & swashes buckling. The visual design for, and photography of, CUTTHROAT ISLAND is gorgeous. Still, when it was all over I had the same feelings one does about a Mustang with a 4-cylinder engine: it looks cool but has no balls. The DVD I watched had a ""windowboxed"" picture, meaning only about 2/3 of the center of the screen is filled, at least when I played it in my Blu-ray player and watched on an HDTV. Good picture quality, such as it was, but be warned... the sound design was all over the place! Dialogue scenes where stupidly quiet; conversations between characters were constantly being drowned out by either the musical score and/or the sound effects. It was a pain to keep turning the volume up almost all the way in order to try and hear what characters were saying only to have to dial it way down when the music started blaring and things started blowing up. This happened throughout the entire picture. What a headache! Bottom line: CUTTHROAT ISLAND was an OK time-waster but I enjoyed the original ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" a LOT more (or any old Errol Flynn film for that matter). 3 STARS",1421020800,,3133,4.9543726235741445

752567,5,6303990452,"Now this movie shows good old pirate fun, here be swabs, cheats, traitors, romance, adventure, and treachery. The first time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old, and I immediately loved it. :) Geena Davis portrays a woman pirate captain with a lot of spirit and ""the bad girl kind of attitude like don't mess with me"". :) Besides Pirates of the Caribbean, you don't see a lot of woman pirates wondering about the seas of film should I say, and Geena Davis plays Morgan Adams the pirate in a way that is classic in my opinion.

The film is about a woman pirate captain searching for her grandfathers lost treasure, while being pursued by the British navy and her wicked uncle Captain Dawg who is the main villain (wonderfully played by Frank Langella) along the way she picks up a theif/slave named William Shaw (played by Matthew Modine) and together while developing a romantic relationship go after the treasure, and the awesome climax of it all is a side by side ship battle. :)

I like this film because it is a true pirate film, it shows in my opinion the rough and tough life of an actual pirate on the high seas, with no fantasy or fiction in it not that any of that is bad. And it is just pure adventure, one exciting thing happens after another and it keeps you wanting more action, I was so entertained by it that I actually hoped that they would eventually make a sequel or even a prequel, but since this movie got bad reviews from critics and did bad in the box office I knew that would not happen, but I don't care about what the critics said, this movie is amazing and very entertaining.

Yet, the film is presented in such a happy-go-lucky manner, it all seems like good fun. Even when enemy pirates are slain, it doesn't really seem like they're ""dying"", it seems more like you're watching a stage production with really enthusiastic actors. The chase/action sequences are marvelously choreographed, and the cast is very likable, with Frank Langella turning in a great performance as the villainous pirate lord, ""Dog"". Geena Davis shines as the unlikely hero (an attractive female leading a band of ruthless pirates). Her acting seemed a bit wooden at first, but her character really grew on me, to the point that I would have gladly supported her against those ruthless rogues that opposed her.

""Cutthroat Island"" seems to fall into the Spielberg formula of the period (1990s).

At the time it was released, it was disliked by most people and rumored to be the biggest money loser in a long time.  However, strangely enough, it's actually quite a fun film in its own right.  Yeah, every scene is a cliche, and all the dialogue is dumb, and the acting is pretty bad, but if you roll it all up, it's a darn good way to entertain yourself for two hours.

Geena Davis does not live up to her potential, but the real miscasting occurred by giving the lead male part to Mathew Modine, when the role clearly called out for Cary Elwes. Modine is not a good actor, although I suppose he gamely tries to muddle through the part.

Cutthroat Island is good movie escapism.  It's swashbuckling and full of action.  Does not live up the high mark set by Errol Flynn in The Sea Hawk or Captain Blood, but parts of it are as good as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise (which I notice stole all the good scenes from Cutthroat Island).

Non stop action, beautifully photographed (marvellous colour - unlike the drab Disney pirate trilogy), funny in all the right places, brilliant cast, great music - what's not to like?

753777,3,6303990452,"This movie is fun with one of my favorite themes. I think it would be so cool to be a pirate. Genna Davis plays Morgan, a female pirate who isn't afraid of any man or adventure that involves high risks. She is on her way to find a treasure on a awe inspiring vision of an island called Cutthroat. It has cliffs of green and spires of mountain peaks, turquoise water surrounding the landform that looks like heaven to jump into. They enjoy a pirate battle with their arch enemy Dawg, and have a jest with mutiny involving some of her swarmy crew. She has a cuddle with a cutie she met in the dungeon for attempting thievery. A rogue with a charming smile. The things I liked most, Of course I would love to sail the seas as a pirate with the treasure map that promised beautiful gems of sea green and pearls as big as robin's eggs. I would have loved to have lived in those times, visiting Tortuga and meeting my true love with a bit of adventure and good fun. The ship so big and majestic with the captains quarters and the little monkey who would perch upon my shoulder like a best friend. The waters and the isles of beaches with the silence of just sand and sea. The bounty of seafaring food that they would dine on with the bottle of rum, even though I don't drink.

There's no CGI here, just plenty of superb stunt work, big sets, bigger explosions, and lots of action. The weak point in the film may be the casting. Geena Davis is a fine actress, but she just doesn't seem to fit the pirate role. Same for Frank Langella...with the buzzed hair and funky outfit he looks more Mad Max than Blackbeard.

It's often tongue in cheek, and Frank Langella is the perfect nemesis. Sure, after watching it again it seemed a little cheesy.  Some of the sword fights with Geena Davis were poorly done - more often than not it was the stunt people moving too soon.  Here cocky comments - cute the first few times. Trite after a dozen. Annoying after twenty.

It's more realistic than many other pirate flicks.  When fighting up in the sail rigging, the two battling captains have to keep one hand on the ropes and are obviously fighting for balance.  Unlike the last Pirates flick when the fighting foes just walked around on top of the sails and masts while the ship bounced, bobbed and spun around under them, with no fear of falling.

I also agree that the acting was at times pretty underpar, but the fun and action more than made up for it. I think that the thing that impressed me the most with this film was the fact that Geena Davis did all her own stunts. Everything you see her character doing is actually her.

I understand that this is an escapist flick and and some creative license is to be expected, but there are limitations. This ain't Indiana Jones.
  All in all, this huge-budgeted turkey should have been great, but falls way short in acting, unbelievable special effects and Geena Davis' cleavage shots. You can only see a petite woman overpower so many 200+lb stout sailors before becomming rediculous.

Maybe it's too absurd: a beautiful woman pirate ""Morgan Adams"" (Geena Davis) punching everyone out at every turn can get a ridiculous and tiresome after awhile. It just an excess of everything, almost cartoon-like, and perhaps that is why it bombed at the box office.

If you haven't had enough action in first hour (and you do), the last half really goes crazy with a non-stop battle scene that goes on and on and on.

Nevertheless, there are some good things to watch in here besides Davis and her pretty face. the movie was filmed in Malta and in Thailand and features some beautiful island photography. The ship is magnificent and when two ships are side-by-side firing cannons at one another, it's an awesome sight and even more awesome sound. You really need to watch this with a good stereo system to appreciate the great audio work in here.

While the Port Royal governor wants so badly the lady pirate, Morgan Adams, and will pay well for her, Dawg Brown (Frank Langella) was grabbing Morgan's father Black Harry (Harris Yulin) to take the first piece of a map (split into three separate pieces) to Cutthroat Island, where a treasure of a Spanish gold ship is said to be buried there...

Each of the other sections of the map is held by Morgan's two uncles: Dawg--the bad pirate who doesn't want to share the treasure--has the second piece stolen from a now-deceased brother, and Mordachai holds the third at Spittlefied Harbor...

So to seek the Spanish Treasure and to avenge her father's death, Morgan (Geena Davis) has to join with her uncle Mordachai and fight her murderous uncle to obtain the third part of the map...

The governor of the island (Patrick Malahide) offers Morgan two alternatives: One, an ignominious death on the gallows or she might cut him in for a share of her grandfather's treasure...

At the slave market, Morgan was looking for a man who can read Latin... So she picked a handsome convict who passes himself off as a physician with a natural pitch for music and a perfect taste in wine... His name was William Shaw (Matthew Modine).

If you enjoy Seventeenth Century pirate movies, and like to see how 92 million dollars were spent in sea-battles, rope-swinging, slow motion swashbuckling action, cannons with many explosions and many fires, plenty of rum, cove and cliffs, lots of treasure, the destruction of two Jamaican towns, gorgeous ocean vistas and breathtaking visuals ... don't miss this one!",1233360000,,1637,4.870503597122302
754043,1,6303990452,"In the late 80s and early 90s, Geena Davis was one of the most interesting and quirky actresses in movies.  She was in several hit movies (The Fly, A League of Their Own, Beetlejuice) and scored an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1988 for ""The Accidental Tourist.""  Things went horribly wrong when she married Renny Harlin in 1993, and he set about trying to make her an action star.  Geena arguably had the potential, as witnessed by her rather kick-ass turn as Thelma in ""Thelma and Louise,"" for which she was Oscar-nominated for Best Actress in 1991.  Indeed, Davis does a decent job and certainly makes a sexy action star.  However, ""Cutthroat Island"" is a terrible action flick that flopped horribly, making back only $10 million of its $100 million dollar budget.  The movie was notorious for its role in sending red-hot 90s movie studio Carolco into bankruptcy.  Davis' career was also irreparably damaged; after the pair made another commercial flop in 1996 (The Long Kiss Goodnight), she didn't make another movie for three years.

The plot of ""Cutthroat Island"" is simple.  Davis plays Morgan Adams, a female pirate from a family of pirates.  When her father dies, she receives 2/3 of a map leading to buried treasure on the legendary Cutthroat Island.  The final 1/3 of the map belongs to her uncle, the evil Dawg Brown (!) played by Frank Langella.  She sets out to steal the map from Dawg and find the treasure, aided by Matthew Modine (the map is in Latin and he can translate it for her).  So far, so good.  Unfortunately, the movie seems to start in the middle of the story and never lets up from there.  It's constant action with no breaks.  An action movie should be action-packed, but ""Cutthroat Island"" is simply frenetic.  The simple plot becomes difficult to follow, as there seems to be no transitions between scenes.  At times, it feels as though sections are missing.  Furthermore, few scenes contain dialogue without some kind of action, which severely limits character development.  As a result, we don't care about the characters or whether they find the treasure.

The action of ""Cutthroat Island"" is also poorly directed.  Nearly every action scene follows a predictable pattern - a gun or cannon is shot, cut to a close-up of an explosion, then finish with people jumping away from the explosion in slow-motion.  The action ends up looking fake, which makes the movie interminably slow and mind-numbing.  The soundtrack is also blaringly loud and omnipresent, which adds to the chaos.  The only thing I enjoyed about ""Cutthroat Island"" was Morgan's pet monkey - he totally steals the show, which is a bad sign for a movie.  ""Cutthroat Island"" is so bad that some people may enjoy watching it to make fun of it.  For me, it was simply too boring to appeal to me even on that level.",1230854400,11,2816,4.764462809917355

This is the kind of movie (a Geena Davis classic as well as a pirate movie cult classic) that a person can watch over and over again to ad nauseum without getting even remotely sick while if you're watching something else like one of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies (which is o.k. in their own right, especially the very first one in the series), you just don't seem to appreciate it or even enjoy it as much as the very first time that you've actually watched it.

Matthew Modine (""Full Metal Jacket"") fares equally well as her companion William Shaw. Frank Langella (1978's ""Dracula"") is terrifically venomous as her evil pirate uncle Dawg. Shame that it didn't do well at the box-office, considering the budget (over $60 million). A sequel (which the ending promised) should have been made.

Consistent with the period-style setting, there is no sexuality or nudity (an ""R"" rating would have been needed for that; I'm no prude, but unless the storyline calls for it, nudity isn't neccessary in a movie; ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and the equally well-made [but, like this film, maligned by stupid critics] ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" being cases in point where nudity was needed; please see my reviews on both films).

Stare in shock as she/he gains a good 50 pounds, as she becomes broad-shouldered and buffs up in mere moments when she becomes a he! She must have eaten a whole lot of red meat really, really fast! Yes, Geena Davis's character's power to turn into a man at will, or at least whenever she falls down, jumps back up, jumps from a ledge more than 3 feet up, or performs any sort of other middling feat of acrobatics or strength in this movie, is QUITE a USEFUL talent INDEED! I can hardly imagine what it would have been like if there were a gratuitous sex scene in the movie! Would he have replaced her then too? Heck, the stunt man did all the hard parts, why didn't they just cast HIM in the movie from the very start and save some money?

This is the worst of all possibilities. As for the watchability of Cutthroat Island, I had to watch it in 3 pieces, i.e. I watched it until it ticked me off, then I came back later and stopped when I could stands no more, and again came back to finish the sucker off. Why give it 2 stars instead of one then?

Not considering themselves true artists in their own right, the only way critics can prove their own relative creativity to themselves and to us is by bashing someone else's work.  Pity them.

To flame this film by calling attention to the fact that its plot is 'stereotypical' and its dialogue is 'flat' is to ignore the fact that they're SUPPOSED to be that way.  What one person calls 'stereotypical', a less anal observer (Renny Harlin maybe?) calls 'CLASSIC'.

And what is 'a high-budget B-movie with flat dialogue and a predictable plot', after all?  Well, I'll give you a few examples: ALIEN was a high-budget B-movie with flat dialogue and a predictable plot.  RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a high-budget B-movie with flat dialogue and a predictable plot.  That didn't stop either of them from being highly enjoyable films, and Cutthroat Island's plot is no more flat or predictable, its characters no more stereotypical, and its acting no more cheesy, than either of them.  Those who flame Cutthroat Island for the fact that the character of Dog Brown is a cardboard cut-out of a pirate villain no doubt flame Raiders of the Lost Ark for the fact that its German villains are just as flat.

Cutthroat Island is a great action movie.  It's not a drama, it's not a romance, it's not a comedy.  It's an action movie, PERIOD, and a superb one at that.  SEE IT if you like action.

754340,4,6303990452,"I'm not sure if it's still true, but at one time Cutthroat Island was considered biggest box-office loss of all time. Sometimes when a film isn't a success the reasons why are obvious. Sometimes a film comes out at the wrong time. Sometimes a film is too radical to have mainstream appeal. And sometimes...I have absolutely no idea why a film isn't a success.

This film is a great movie in the modern sense. By that I mean that the dialog is cheesy, the plot is predictable, the characters are lovable and the budget is massive. In some movies you wonder where all the money for the special effects went. Not this time. In this spectacle of celluloid you will witness the destruction of entire towns, and see a ship literally blown into toothpick-size pieces! As you would hope for, there is a ton of action-filled sword-fights and silly romance as well.

With awesome sound effects, a rousing musical score, and lavish cinematography, perhaps the real deciding factor in a person's feeling of love or hate toward this one will be Geena Davis' portrayal of the Mogan Adams, possibly the toughest female ever to sail across the silver screen. Visibly doing most of her own stunts (some of which look incredibly dangerous, if not outright painful), pretty much all of the drama, comedy, romance, and action is centered on her. Personally, I find her performance charming and her stunt-work through the numerous action sequences inspiring.

I think everyone should see this film at least once, if only for the stunts, explosions, sword-fights, and wonderfully cheesy dialog. Pirate movie fanatics should order a copy immediately and prepare to set sail!",1108339200,9,1651,4.910394265232975

Geena Davis fresh off the success of Thelma & Louise tries to make the world's first feminist Pirate movie. Unfortunately she looks and feels out of place. I was never able to suspend my disbelief watching her in the role of a pirate. Her acting isn't on the level of her great work in The Accidental Tourist and Thelma & Louise, It's the worst performance of her career. It's like she forgot everything she learned about acting. In a lot of scenes she gets shot and stabbed, but in later frames doesn't act injured at all. I guess they were trying to show how tough she is unfortunately she looks ridiculous.

The film has lavish set pieces, and elaborate stunt work. Unfortunately it's not seamless. In many frames you can see the stuntmen!  The plot about pirates traveling the world for a treasure just doesn't come together. The story has holes you can drive a pirate ship through. You never believe the fantasy because of Davis' wooden performance and the poor special effects.

Geena Davis' career never recovered after this disaster. If you like her work get the Accidental Tourist or Thelma & Louise. If you want to see a strong female hero, Check out Alien.",1099267200,9,1393,4.53784860557769

Frank Langella was wonderful as Dawg Brown. I wanted to see more of him, and I wanted to know more of his motivations, more of the history behind he and his brothers Mordechai and Harry and the story behind the gold.  Gina Davis was really a very good heroine in this movie, as Morgan Adams.  She is now captain of the ship she has inherited from her father, Harry and as a woman, she has her challenges on a shipload of men, to be sure.  But she is energetic and tough enough to make you believe it is within the realm of possibility.  Davis' beauty is found in her underlying strength.  The disappointment in her character for me lie in the fact that she far outshone Matthew Modine.  Modine's performance  was rather flat when set next to the leading lady and he seemed almost like a Saturday morning cartoon, or a young father playing pirates on the city park playground with his own children. It just did not come off as a very good performance at all.  The spark between Davis and Modine was not at all believeable.  If they had gotten someone else to play that role who was a bit more of a leading man, the movie may have been a lot better.  I keep wanting to cast someone like Oded Fehr or Brandon Frazier, or someone of that ilk.

I whole heatedly believe that Cutthroat was as good, if not far better than Pirates.  I would yield to the arguments that the acting here is a bit cheeky, and the editors could have been a touch more through.  Beyond that, I don't know what the fuss is about.  Maybe the other reviewers just couldn't stomach a (historically improbable) female pirate.  Well, I think this movie was a lot of fun, but apparently there are some who didn't care for it.

Can you walk up to anyone on the street, hand them a quarter and say, ""Please blow five things up for me""? Of course you can; sometimes someone might even blow something up. But with this movie, it's a sure thing.
This movie has its flaws. For the money spent to make it, you'd think someone would have thrown in some free looping so misinflected dialogue could be corrected. The chase and action scenes are rarely plausible (surely not every cannonball would have hit a powder keg). Whatever happened to the third ship that was at CutThroat Island? Wait, who cares? ...

The DVD menu system on this disc is very strange. When you choose ""Coming Attractions"" from the ""Theatrical Trailers"" menu, you're presented with a list of eleven movies; no trailers, just the names of eleven movies and tiny pictures of their movie posters.

Fortunately, the movie itself looks and sounds great. Frank Langella and Maury Chaykin turn in characteristically good performances, Matthew Modine and Geena Davis acquit themselves well if not perfectly, and Christopher Masterson (Francis on ""Malcolm in the Middle"") does pretty well for a 15-year-old.
While there are better pirate films out there, CutThroat Island isn't all that bad of a film.

Okay, it's a pirate movie, an entertainment so I wasn't expecting ""realism"" or believability throughout.  However, there's a limit to the suspension of disbelief.  When the stunts get too ridiculously outlandish, as in the carriage chase scene when Geena Davis goes over the awning and lands perfectly back in the driver's seat, the movie ceases to entertain.  Also ridiculous:  when Mathew Modine pulls a bullet out of Geena Davis' midsection and they immediately indulge in a bit of kissy face.  It's so over the top I began to lose interest.
On the plus side:  great scenery, lavish period costumes.  A 'fifties-era pseudo-Copeland, pseudo-Stravinsky sound track. Best performance by far is that of Frank Langella.  What a great bad guy!  He did a superb job. And if you like things that blow up and go 'boom' there's enough to wet the most adolescent appetite.
What else makes this one such a dud?  The insipid, post-modern dialog and sarcastic one-liners, especially out the mouth of the
insufferable Matthew Modine.  Geena Davis' not inconsiderable acting ability is obliterated by the god-awful script.

Swashbuckling Action, humor more action, positive ending. Doesn't take itself too seriously.

Cons
Cartoonish, far fetched (not as bad as the hour + instant hypothermia silliness in Titanic) but still impossible.

This is action and humor, a real swashbuckler.  Gena Davis is outstanding and the story line (although thin) holds together well, and the action and scenes fit it well.

It is a bit far fetched here and there but heck ITS A MOVIE! and a good one at that.  (If you want a boring documentary, or philosophical discussion you won't find it here).  If you want action, pirate ships, swordfights, explosions, swashbuckling fun and humor, get this movie and enjoy the ride.

(Spoilers in this paragraph.)  Things have a tendency to explode in fire without reason, the heroine gets shot in the waist and then doesn't feel any effects until 10 minutes later in the movie, a completely B.S. romance, plot devices pop up all over, etc., etc.
Now despite all this unrealism that the movie has, it's a good pirate/action movie if you accept that the writing is bad.  This unrealism I will say doesn't extend to Morgan, the main character, played by Geena Davis.  I'm a vehement equalist when it comes to rights between the genders--and I'm a man, so take that, you feminazis--so I have absolutely no problem with a female pirate captain, even in 1668 when the movie's set.

Real-life pirates of both the past and present are violent--Duh.  And secondly, since when do sensuality and sexuality mean the same?

The other two are with her uncles, the cowardly Mordachai (George Murcell) and the evil Dawg Brown (Frank Langella). So Morgan, with the help of her crew and the somewhat untrustworthy thief, William Shaw (Matthew Modine), she sets off to take all the maps and find the treasure of Cutthroat Island.
A very entertaining movie filled with action, adventure, and piracy on the high seas, ""Cutthroat Island"" is a pure adventure movie. The plot is pretty mediocre, allowing as much action and suspense to be put in the story. It's your typical pirate story though, pirates must find, understand, and figure out the map leading to a mysterious island with hidden treasure of unthinkable riches. But throwing in a tough, hard-bitten, and beautiful piratess was a pretty nice touch, including a thief to provide some comic relief.
Geena Davis surprises me again with her talent in being able to play many different roles from a ghost in ""Beetlejuice"", a baseball player in ""A League of Their Own"", a mother full of heart in the Stuart Little movies, and now a piratess in ""Cutthroat Island"". She gets to give plenty of punches plus handle the cutlass with ease as she fights pirates, the military, and her uncle. She's definitely very cool! As for Matthew Modine, I had never seen him in any movies before but I found him astoundingly funny though he gets plenty of action. He in a way reminds me of Cary Elwes as Wesley in ""The Princess Bride"" with his sarcastic humor and boundless enthusiasm. Oh, it was also a special treat to see the young and sweet Christopher Masterson as Bowen. Though his role was small, he was excellent as a cabin boy with his obvious admiration and loyalty to his captain. He's probably more known as Chris Masterson, starring in ""Dragonheart: A New Beginning"" and also starring in the series, ""Malcom in the Middle"".
So if you're in the mood for a movie with giving off lots of action, energy, suspense, and swashbuckling, make time to watch ""Cutthroat Island"". Rated PG-13 for the action and fighting and also for some innuendo.",1028678400,14,2344,4.747549019607843

CUTTHROAT ISLAND holds the undesirable distinction of being the biggest box office bomb of all time. It's overblown, messy, and worst of all, not very entertaining. Director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) seems to have forgotten the one crucial rule to these kinds of films, and that is, story before spectacle. That's not to say it is devoid of merits; there are some impressive battle scenes, it has a great musical score and Geena Davis is good, but it leaves the viewer ultimatley unsatisfied.

754577,3,6303990452,"Arrr, mateys.  It takes a lot of work to create an absolutely stinkeroo pirate movie, and it has been done, but Cutthroat island is not quite *that* bad.  It just doesn't really try to rise above its modest objectives, either, and was not designed for more than set-piece spectacle sequences linked by the minimum requirement of exposition and character development.  It's a popcorn movie pure and simple, and taken as that (and with a bottle of rum) it is a few hours of fun.  Subtract one star, or maybe two, from the above rating if you simply aren't interested in salty tales of bloodthirsty freebooters, shiver me timbers.  There is little in the way of convincing acting or believeable physics or original plot, but things blow up frequently and there is fighting and sailing and wenching and Jolly Rogers flying and lots of suitable pirate greed on display.  It *should* have been better -- they might have spent more on a decent script, stronger casting, and a more capable director --  but it isn't unwatchable and it ought to get you yo-ho-hoing well enough.  Then try ""Treasure Island"" with Charlton Heston  for a top-notch buccaneer tale, ye scurvy swabs.

Add a star for the truly rousing old-school soundtrack, which is available as a double-CD set in some limited edition fashion.  Well worth the investment!

Technical caveat:  Did I get a bad DVD, or what? I can't get the French language audio feature to work and the English subtitle feature is always ON when I put this disk in and play it, unless I manually click thru the menu to disable it.

754578,4,6303990452,"Cutthroat Island is not a great movie by any means.  But it is a lot of fun if you enjoy pirate treasure, sea battles, sword fighting, a great soundtrack, and wonderful period costumes.  The script is pretty weak and much of the acting is wooden.  Worse yet, it seems that no one learned anything from Errol Flynn's The Sea Hawk because they once again include a rather annoying monkey as comedy relief.  But what they do right is what makes this movie worth watching.  The film wonderfully recreates the 17th century Caribbean world of the pirates and is probably the most realistic looking realization of this time and place to date.  The actual portrayal of the pirates themselves owes more to ""Treasure Island"" and ""Peter Pan"" than ""The American Sea Rovers"", but there is definately something compelling in the romantic myth of the golden age of piracy.  The pirate movie has suffered in recent years and Cutthroat will probably do nothing to revive it, which is really a shame as they, like the western and sci-fi adventure, are the best incarnations of modern myth to be found today.
The story revolves around the quest of Captain Morgan Adams, the sexy yet honorable pirate queen, to avenge her father's murder and outwit her evil pirate nemesis and fratricidal uncle, Captain ""Dawg"" (who makes these names up?).  Taking command of her late father's ship and now in possession of part of a map to locate her father's lost treasure, Morgan sets out to win the vast riches for her and her hardy crew.  On the way she engages the services of the roguish ""Doctor"" Shaw, manages to obtain the remaining pieces of the map, then goes on to brave mutinies, betrayals, storms at sea, exploding cannonballs, bad dialogue, and cliched bad guys in a worthwhle romp through an era gone by, when men and women sailed tall wooden ships,  killed many people for profit, and drank themselves into oblivion on the high seas.
I gave Cutthroat Island one more star than it probably really deserves simply for being a really guilty pleasure.  So grab your bottle of rum and cold steel cutlass and check it out!",1010448000,30,2096,4.730769230769231

Probably worst of all, they drown this film in crude and stupid humor; the action is entirely ridiculous and implausible, and of course the story line is predictable and totally stupid.

This is one of the few times I've seen Davis in a leading role;  normally, she is a supporting actress.  She pulls it off quite well, although in a couple of scenes her acting is a bit wooden.  Frank Langella stands out as an old-salt, ruthless pirate while Matthew Modine is great as the movie's comic relief.
What really makes this movie worth buying, tho, is just how well done it is.  The 17th century sets are lavish - you feel as tho you are back in the period in which the movie takes place.  The soundtrack is riveting, and I found the sound of the DVD quite excellent.  Not sure if they did anything different than they do with other DVDs, but it sure seemed like the audio was a notch above most DVDs - esp in the storm sequence.

754658,3,6303990452,"Most pirate movies (Captain Blood, Roman Polanski's Pirates, etc) are forced to exist in a genre by themselves.
For the most part, when you compare them with other films, they stink.  Their plots are usually outlandish and historically inaccurate, involving much buckling of swash and romantic drivel interspersed with mighty ships exchanging cannonfire and very little substance in between.
If that sounds like your idea of a good, simple-minded escapist film, CutThroat Island may be for you, especially since it is one of the only entries into the pirate genre in the last 10 years or so.
This film has the dubious distinction of going down in the Guiness Book of World Records as the movie that cost the studio the most money to make - the return on their investment was nothing near the $100 million + required to make the movie.  The acting is BAD, with horrible accents - or an utter lack of regard for such ""trivialities"" - and more flat lines than a hospital ward full of dead people.  The sets are extravegant but most of them ending up getting blown up.  Apparently, many of the cannonballs used in that time were actually small bombs that caused stone buildings, piles of wood and straw, and human beings to explode into enormous balls of special-effect fire.
The ending was shot on the same island in Thailand as ""The Beach,"" and the settings are actually one of the positive points of the film.
For those who enjoy the pirate genre, where things don't necessarily make a lot of sense in the real world but salty dogs and barrels of gunpowder mix with parrots and pieces 'o eight to create swashbuckling action and sappy romance, CutThroat Island is good.  The DVD is affordable, although the video transfer leaves something to be desired - there are black dots and lines everywhere, and there is an annoying white line running down the right side of the screen on the letterbox version.  In addition, there are no ""extras"" save a couple of trailers.  On the plus side, both letterbox and 4:3 (TV) versions are available on the one disc, and the sound transfer (for better or for worse, if you listen to the accents too closely) is perfect.

754659,4,6303990452,"For my money I say you can't beat a good adventure flick, and Cutthroat Island delivers on the adventure. Explosions, swordplay, and greed; it's everything a pirate action film should be.
The plot is reasonably  good--not the absolute best, but plenty good enough, with just enough  twists and turns to stay lively. (By 1990s standards, it's well above  average.) The action is somewhat better, keeping the story going forward at  a good pace without ever becoming tedious. All in all, the director did a  great job of keeping the movie entertaining and keeping the audience  involved in the story.
My only complaint about the film is Matthew  Modine, who I've always considered a weak actor. In this movie he's no  exception, though fortunately he plays a bit of a weasely duck-and-cover  man anyway through the beginning of the film, covering up some of the worst  of it. Still the movie is entertaining enough to make up for that, and then  there's Geena Davis in a pirate costume; gads that's good cinema.

The film is well directed, but it came out during a time when alleged ""revolutionary"" film makers wanted to break the mold and stereotypes that they believed had been reinforced by Hollywood films.

One of the main problems with this logic is that no one had cranked out a serious pirate movie since the early 60s.  And to ""bust the mold"" of showing white 18th or 17th century naval captains in a 90s major feature film because everyone else is supposedly doing it, to me, is pretty ludicrous.because, as I stated, no one else is making pirate movies in the first place.

Having said that the imagery is pretty good.  It's a respectably shot film, though it's pretty flat at times due to miscasting the lead.

The image is larger and clearer compared to the DVD issue, and I think that's about all you can of this thing.  Appropriately priced at around $10 American, I wouldn't pay much more for it.
