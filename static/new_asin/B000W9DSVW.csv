2963540,5,B000W9DSVW,"What a great deal for all 3 HD DVD's, under $20 each. 11 is a modern classic, 12 is a lot of fun, and 13 is another delightful classic in the vein of the first. A great trilogy of fun movies- these aren't monumental motion pictures, they are fluff, they are fun, and I'll have this on my shelf for years to come.",1193443200,12,312,3.9682539682539684
2963541,5,B000W9DSVW,"I cannot wait for this to come out.  In my opinion, this collection is one of George Clooney's best work!!  I am pre-ordering it as soon as I finish this comment.  Great movies, Great acting, Great all round....LOVED THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!",1192838400,,236,4.85
2963542,4,B000W9DSVW,"Dear all, if you are interested only in Ocean's Thirteen dvd & don't want to buy the whole trilogy, wait until the release date of the trilogy & the studio will release it alone at the same date & the releasing will include a wide screen version & full screen version.",1192752000,7,268,4.2745098039215685
2963543,4,B000W9DSVW,"Ocean's Eleven is a fantastic film and the two follow on are still a good time, although not the same quality as the first.  The second is by far the weakest and takes the most liberties with being ridiculous.  You do have to suspend disbelief in these films but it is totally insane to say they are a bad trilogy especially when the first is genius.  Not to mention that the original is actually pretty crappy if you go back and watch it.  Just because it is a classic doesn't make it good.  If you look at the original Thomas Crown it is actually quite bad.  The remake was a fun, very well done film.  Clearly the previous reviewer has an axe to grind and that is making it into their review.  If the extras are anything like extras on the non-HD versions, you'll be pleased.  Rarely have I appreciated a commentary but they have some great ones on these discs.",1192060800,25,864,4.316770186335404
2963544,1,B000W9DSVW,"This is the quintessential example of Hollywood greed. If you actually thought Ocean's 11 was a decent remake, you can't buy it. You've got to pay for the horrific remakes done twice where this famous 21st century brat pack of actors were paid a ransom to have a blast and horse around without a script and take advantage of a franchise name. Perhaps the worst trilogy around, you have to have rocks in your head to want to pay over $50 for the ""privilege"" of owning all three. Wait a few weeks for this to be in the clearance rack and pick it up for few quarters. Shame on the studios and may you take a beating on this disgraceful attempt to capitalize on your monopoly.",1191801600,6,672,4.341269841269841

2963585,1,B000W9DSVW,"I was super stoked to buy this package set of DVDs and could not wait for it to arrive. I absolutely love this movie trilogy which is why I am still purchasing this product years after these movies originally debuted.

Unfortunately, my happiness was extremely short-lived.

At first glance, the product appeared fine. The housing for the DVD cases was a little damaged but I figured that was nothing to fret about. The DVDs themselves looked like they were in good condition until I tried to play them. I started with Eleven and everything was working fine until the DVD keep inadvertently pausing. My player continually had trouble reading the disc so naturally I pulled it out and cleaned it off and put it back in. Same thing. There were no visible scratches or marks so I gave the DVD the benefit of the doubt and assumed that my player was the issue. I then tried it on four different devices (two other DVD players, my laptop, and my XBOX 360) and I received the same result. This was becoming exceedingly frustrating so I tried the other two DVDs and the players did not even read those.

So essentially, these DVDs do not work at all. They are reminiscent of some form of pirated or ripped material and I am absolutely appalled at this purchase. I have purchased DVDs out of the $5 junk bin at Walmart that work better than this. I have read some of the other reviews on this product and I am starting to wonder whether this is some kind of scam product that slipped into the Amazon market.

I rarely have a bad purchase from Amazon but this is by far, the very worst. In addition to all of this, the delivery took almost two weeks to reach me which is way beyond the Amazon Prime two-day shipping rate that I purchased. I fully intend to acquire a refund and/or receive a replacement set of DVDs and will be having some strong words with the sellers and distributors of this product.",1458604800,2,1893,4.46242774566474

I would definitely recommend these movies to anyone, such great actors and a group of people!",1456704000,,369,4.36231884057971

2963639,4,B000W9DSVW,"I don't understand all of the negative comments that revolve around blu ray. From what the ad says, this is an HD DVD. It is old Toshiba backed tech that went up against blu ray and lost the HD war. It will never play in a blu ray player or a regular dvd player unless you purchased a two sided, combo disc. This has the normal SD video on one side, and the HD video on the other. It clearly says in the ad that it will not play in anything other than an HD dvd player. If you are attempting to play this in a blu ray player, keep in mind that the laser technology differs from the HD dvd laser. I own two Toshiba HD dvd players and about 40 HD DVD movies. I have run into a few viewing problems, but that is due to a dirty lense. After giving it a clean, it works fine. By the way, the picture quality of HD DVD looks better than Blu ray. I think Toshiba lost only because the name ""blu ray"" sounded cooler.",1418688000,,908,3.9135135135135135

2963643,1,B000W9DSVW,"Although this is one of my favorite set of movies, it was so disappointing to watch the poor recording quality as other reviewers have stated. Wish I would have read the reviews first. This set is not a 3 DVD boxed set like the picture, it is a single blu ray case with a 2-disk insert that is not secured. As for picture quality it is definitely not the expected crisp HD blu-ray quality you might be hoping for, but instead choppy transitions, few lags, and a lot of picture ""noise"". Very very disappointing and in some cases it actually is somewhat dizzying, similar to the effect of watching a 3D movie without the 3D glasses, but to a lesser degree. I would recommend buying the regular DVD version as this is absolutely NOT worth it.",1416441600,4,739,4.4411764705882355

2963650,5,B000W9DSVW,"I'd never seen the two sequels before purchasing this trilogy, but the $15 price for the set was to good to resist.  ""Ocean's 11"" is wonderful, of course -- a witty and clever and exciting crime caper.  ""Ocean's 12"" caught me a bit off-guard.  It has a more convoluted plot -- more artsy than the other two films, perhaps because it's set in Europe -- and took a good 45-minute to get moving, for me.  Still, I enjoyed it and suspect I'll enjoy it more the second time around.  ""Ocean's 13"" is perhaps the equal of ""Ocean's 11"".  It's complex -- but not convoluted -- and lots of fun.  $15 for all three films -- on blu-ray! -- is really a bargain.

The quality of the blu-ray picture itself isn't anything special.  It's fine and all that, but the films have sort of an orange cast to them and a soft focus -- no doubt the director's intention.  It's not that they look bad, but just that they don't have the clarity of some blu-rays, like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", or ""The Untouchables"".  The sound is fine, but generally lacks any exciting surround sound panning -- these films aren't ""Top Gun"" after all.  All in all, a worthy purchase and a good deal.",1412726400,3,1184,4.405529953917051

With movies like this I don't think there is much of any difference between blu-ray and regular DVD.

I had already seen Ocean's 11 and 12. I like them both. Ocean's 11 is enigmatic and just smooth. Ocean's 12 is similar but there's more emphasis on romance, so not quite the boy's club the first one was. Ocean's 13 was entertaining but it lacked the element of surprise. Still, as a fan, it was enjoyable. Also, all three movies showcase great music. I'll be looking for those tracks next.",1354233600,,568,4.40952380952381

2963759,4,B000W9DSVW,"I was first skeptical of purchasing this item due to the number of people that say the picture quality is bad. To start things off, no, it is not 7.1 surround (it's 5.1). I'm fine with that, though, because this movie doesn't really need it. No choppers flying overhead or crazy sound effects. The picture is great though. It is not as good as Avatar on Blu-ray, but is still a good 1080 picture. I'm thinking WB Studios has responded to feedback about it being bad, because my dad purchased Ocean's 11 on Blu-ray a couple of years ago, and I instantly noticed that it was not a Blu-ray worthy picture. These discs are just fine and dandy though. Then when you throw in the 13.99 price I paid shipped-from and sold-by Amazon, it is definitely worth it.

UPDATE: I went back and looked at Ocean's 11 on my DVR when it was aired in 1080p. THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE ARE CUT OFF ON THE BLU-RAY. I thought the black spaces at the top and bottom of the Blu-ray picture (I have a 16:9 screen tv) were because they just made it really wide screen and added to the picture on the sides, BUT, this is not the case. They simply chopped off the top and bottom for no reason.",1334016000,2,1170,4.246636771300448

2963761,3,B000W9DSVW,"I guess my wife had seen ""Ocean's Eleven"" in the theater some time ago and was greatly impressed. As such, she found this Ocean's Trilogy (11, 12, 13) and insisted that we get it. Well, I've now viewed, reviewed and rated all three movies.

All of these movies have high production values. These are not cheaply made movies. The filming, sound, pace, star actors and everything was good. Even some of the acting wasn't too bad, although I got tired of watching Brad Pitt feeding his face. The original ""Ocean's Eleven"" was a reasonably good movie and provided interesting viewing in the manner of the old ""Mission Impossible"" episodes. The two follow-up ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" movies were failed attempts as sequels and not worth viewing. That's just my opinion.  There are Ocean's fans who love them all. So what might my advice be? Unless you're an Ocean's fan, save your money.

I was sure the third would be the worst, but that is actually my favorite, and that was the one I'd never seen before.  So the movies are great; I really enjoy them.  EXCEPT for the quality.  People aren't kidding when they say this is the worst blu-ray movie quality they've ever seen.  I don't know what the DVDs look like, but they might look about the same as this.  But if you think about it, $18 is still an ok price for 3 DVDs.  The third movie is definitely the best quality.  Some scenes have some pretty impressive Vegas scenery.

So bottom line, I still think the price is worth it, if you're paying around $18.  Under no circumstances should anyone pay over $20 for this.  It's just not good enough quality to warrant that.",1325289600,2,858,4.327044025157233

2963778,2,B000W9DSVW,"3 stars is for $ ONLY.  I got mine for $18 on Amazon.  IF this was the usual $30-$50, I would give it 1 star because of the quality of the transfer.

(For me) The first is my fav.  The second it seemed like they tried way too hard to make it confusing, and it didn't seem to really climax.  It was also plagued by over-performed acting.  The third I think they brought it back down to normalcy.  It neither had the complexity of the first nor the confusion of the second.  It was done straight.  You never asked how they did it. A bit of a snoozer though.

I forgot how disappointing the second and third movies were.  I am a huge fan of Soderbergh though and for $15 you can't complain!

Hidefdigest was right.  The first movie looks pretty good while the second 2 are awful. The picture never pops and the second 2 have so much grain it is ridiculous.  The last two movies look like dvd's.  It is like they literally took the video_ts files and put them on a blank dvd.

As for the audio, Dolby Digital 5.1 is all you get.  I kept cycling through my receiver and the BR menu looking for the TrueHD/DTS ma option.  Really?  Even Frosty the snowman on BR has True HD.  What's the deal?

If the first movie is pretty cheap on BR I would suggest picking it up and keeping your other 2 movies on DVD.  But, like I said before, $15 is not exactly breaking the bank either.",1324080000,8,1368,4.141221374045801

Don't worry, I've heard all of the criticism already, you don't even need to waste your time.  I've heard that Ocean's Twelve is a mish-mash of witticisms and European landscapes and that Ocean's Thirteen, while on one hand is a triumphant return to Vegas, lacks the overall magic of the first film.  Well, let me just say this: you're dead wrong.  This is, without a doubt, the best and most entertaining trilogy you'll ever have the joy of laying your peasant eyes on.  Ocean's Eleven is arguably a perfect film.  I dare you to come up with a legitimate complaint with this film (don't worry, it can't be done).  Ocean's Twelve is a delightful romp through Soderbergh's cinematographic dreams, coupled with excellent performances, despite the under utilization of Bernie Mac.  Ocean's Thirteen rebuffs the obviously weaker Twelve with a stronger use of Bernie Mac and a smoother ensemble feel to the movie.  These movies, altogether, are truly masterpieces.  Don't waste your time on 15 hours of Lord of the Rings, or the Ewok song.  This is where it's at, buddy.  You're not doing much better than this.",1323216000,3,1216,4.788461538461538

Ocean's Twelve has no special features other than it's own movie trailer.  Ocean's Thirteen has a few additional scenes, and a couple casino video extras.  So, it you are a person who is looking to by this set because of special features and extras, I would look for something different.

The problem is that because they are crooks (lovable crooks, but crooks nonetheless) their operations usually happen at night or in the dark. That means tons of film noise, which is gloriously captured in 1080p. I find that some of the night/dark shots are grainy to a point of being obvious, though not enough to annoy me. It's like two guys sitting next to you in the theater, constantly chatting away in low volumes. It doesn't distract from the movie, but you'd enjoy things a little more if it weren't there.

If you are a fan of the set it is a nice collection to have and that is why I bought it but is far from showing what blu-ray has to offer.

First, O12 includes a new commentary with Soderbergh and writer George Nolfi, a selection of additional scenes and an HBO Making-Of Special. O13 also includes a commentary with Soderbergh and writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien and a Masters of the Heist featurette (though that one is available via a bonus disc at Target I believe). Also included are additional scenes and a couple other featurettes, most in HD.

Honestly, the picture quality isn't anything great but it is good. Of course, this isn't something I'm going to use to show off my home theater but for general home viewing, I know I will be watching these over and over again (yes, even Ocean's Twelve, a movie that has grown on me over the years).

You do have to suspend disbelief in these films but it is totally insane to say they are a bad trilogy especially when the first is genius.  Not to mention that the original is actually pretty crappy if you go back and watch it.  Just because it is a classic doesn't make it good.  If you look at the original Thomas Crown it is actually quite bad.  The remake was a fun, very well done film.

3198082,1,B000W9DSVW,"I was super stoked to buy this package set of DVDs and could not wait for it to arrive. I absolutely love this movie trilogy which is why I am still purchasing this product years after these movies originally debuted.

Unfortunately, my happiness was extremely short-lived.

At first glance, the product appeared fine. The housing for the DVD cases was a little damaged but I figured that was nothing to fret about. The DVDs themselves looked like they were in good condition until I tried to play them. I started with Eleven and everything was working fine until the DVD keep inadvertently pausing. My player continually had trouble reading the disc so naturally I pulled it out and cleaned it off and put it back in. Same thing. There were no visible scratches or marks so I gave the DVD the benefit of the doubt and assumed that my player was the issue. I then tried it on four different devices (two other DVD players, my laptop, and my XBOX 360) and I received the same result. This was becoming exceedingly frustrating so I tried the other two DVDs and the players did not even read those.

So essentially, these DVDs do not work at all. They are reminiscent of some form of pirated or ripped material and I am absolutely appalled at this purchase. I have purchased DVDs out of the $5 junk bin at Walmart that work better than this. I have read some of the other reviews on this product and I am starting to wonder whether this is some kind of scam product that slipped into the Amazon market.

I rarely have a bad purchase from Amazon but this is by far, the very worst. In addition to all of this, the delivery took almost two weeks to reach me which is way beyond the Amazon Prime two-day shipping rate that I purchased. I fully intend to acquire a refund and/or receive a replacement set of DVDs and will be having some strong words with the sellers and distributors of this product.",1458604800,2,1893,4.46242774566474

3198136,4,B000W9DSVW,"I don't understand all of the negative comments that revolve around blu ray. From what the ad says, this is an HD DVD. It is old Toshiba backed tech that went up against blu ray and lost the HD war. It will never play in a blu ray player or a regular dvd player unless you purchased a two sided, combo disc. This has the normal SD video on one side, and the HD video on the other. It clearly says in the ad that it will not play in anything other than an HD dvd player. If you are attempting to play this in a blu ray player, keep in mind that the laser technology differs from the HD dvd laser. I own two Toshiba HD dvd players and about 40 HD DVD movies. I have run into a few viewing problems, but that is due to a dirty lense. After giving it a clean, it works fine. By the way, the picture quality of HD DVD looks better than Blu ray. I think Toshiba lost only because the name ""blu ray"" sounded cooler.",1418688000,,908,3.9135135135135135

3198140,1,B000W9DSVW,"Although this is one of my favorite set of movies, it was so disappointing to watch the poor recording quality as other reviewers have stated. Wish I would have read the reviews first. This set is not a 3 DVD boxed set like the picture, it is a single blu ray case with a 2-disk insert that is not secured. As for picture quality it is definitely not the expected crisp HD blu-ray quality you might be hoping for, but instead choppy transitions, few lags, and a lot of picture ""noise"". Very very disappointing and in some cases it actually is somewhat dizzying, similar to the effect of watching a 3D movie without the 3D glasses, but to a lesser degree. I would recommend buying the regular DVD version as this is absolutely NOT worth it.",1416441600,4,739,4.4411764705882355

3198147,5,B000W9DSVW,"I'd never seen the two sequels before purchasing this trilogy, but the $15 price for the set was to good to resist.  ""Ocean's 11"" is wonderful, of course -- a witty and clever and exciting crime caper.  ""Ocean's 12"" caught me a bit off-guard.  It has a more convoluted plot -- more artsy than the other two films, perhaps because it's set in Europe -- and took a good 45-minute to get moving, for me.  Still, I enjoyed it and suspect I'll enjoy it more the second time around.  ""Ocean's 13"" is perhaps the equal of ""Ocean's 11"".  It's complex -- but not convoluted -- and lots of fun.  $15 for all three films -- on blu-ray! -- is really a bargain.

The quality of the blu-ray picture itself isn't anything special.  It's fine and all that, but the films have sort of an orange cast to them and a soft focus -- no doubt the director's intention.  It's not that they look bad, but just that they don't have the clarity of some blu-rays, like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", or ""The Untouchables"".  The sound is fine, but generally lacks any exciting surround sound panning -- these films aren't ""Top Gun"" after all.  All in all, a worthy purchase and a good deal.",1412726400,3,1184,4.405529953917051

The reason for the bad review is that they didn't send the box set that is pictured. I received all three movies in individual cases, that all fit into a cheap cardboard sleeve. It's ok, but not at all what I wanted/ordered.

Also, the first disc is pretty scratched. I don't know if it'll play.

The quality is the same kind of quality you would come to expect from Blu Ray, flawless. I may have seen some errors like pixelated shades of black during dark parts of the movie, but I'm assuming it's only because I was using a cheaper kind of TV. But packaging and shipment was great, items arrived on time and were brand new and still in wrappers.

They are well worthy of being called Blu-ray, the quality is most excellent. I can't help but wonder and bet that 50-75% of the people who bitched about the quality have older tv's and have not bought anything made more recent that supports 1080p quality which truly brings out the blu ray quality to it's best.

Ocean's 11 is the best and I believe most people will agree, but as a whole it is a good trilogy to watch to veg out. With movies like this I don't think there is much of any difference between blu-ray and regular DVD.  If I wanted to be a real critic then I guess the color is more vibrant with the blu-ray versions but if you are looking to save a couple bucks while adding to your movie collection, the DVD version is fine.",1359244800,,585,4.223214285714286

I was under the distinct belief that blu-ray was the best video and sound quality available to date, so why would the blu-ray makers release these films (or any film) with stepped on VHS copy quality?

I had already seen Ocean's 11 and 12. I like them both. Ocean's 11 is enigmatic and just smooth. Ocean's 12 is similar but there's more emphasis on romance, so not quite the boy's club the first one was. Ocean's 13 was entertaining but it lacked the element of surprise.

3198256,4,B000W9DSVW,"I was first skeptical of purchasing this item due to the number of people that say the picture quality is bad. To start things off, no, it is not 7.1 surround (it's 5.1). I'm fine with that, though, because this movie doesn't really need it. No choppers flying overhead or crazy sound effects. The picture is great though. It is not as good as Avatar on Blu-ray, but is still a good 1080 picture. I'm thinking WB Studios has responded to feedback about it being bad, because my dad purchased Ocean's 11 on Blu-ray a couple of years ago, and I instantly noticed that it was not a Blu-ray worthy picture. These discs are just fine and dandy though. Then when you throw in the 13.99 price I paid shipped-from and sold-by Amazon, it is definitely worth it.

UPDATE: I went back and looked at Ocean's 11 on my DVR when it was aired in 1080p. THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE ARE CUT OFF ON THE BLU-RAY. I thought the black spaces at the top and bottom of the Blu-ray picture (I have a 16:9 screen tv) were because they just made it really wide screen and added to the picture on the sides, BUT, this is not the case. They simply chopped off the top and bottom for no reason.",1334016000,2,1170,4.246636771300448

The quality of my movies were fine, I didn't see any scratches on the disc or any sign that they were not new. Overall I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to any fan of the Ocean's movies.",1334016000,,445,4.01123595505618
3198258,3,B000W9DSVW,"I guess my wife had seen ""Ocean's Eleven"" in the theater some time ago and was greatly impressed. As such, she found this Ocean's Trilogy (11, 12, 13) and insisted that we get it. Well, I've now viewed, reviewed and rated all three movies.

All of these movies have high production values. These are not cheaply made movies. The filming, sound, pace, star actors and everything was good. Even some of the acting wasn't too bad, although I got tired of watching Brad Pitt feeding his face. The original ""Ocean's Eleven"" was a reasonably good movie and provided interesting viewing in the manner of the old ""Mission Impossible"" episodes. The two follow-up ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" movies were failed attempts as sequels and not worth viewing. That's just my opinion.  There are Ocean's fans who love them all. So what might my advice be? Unless you're an Ocean's fan, save your money.

3198273,3,B000W9DSVW,"I bought this because it was $18 for a blu-ray trilogy, which is pretty crazy.  I had actually never seen all the movies.  I was sure the third would be the worst, but that is actually my favorite, and that was the one I'd never seen before.  So the movies are great; I really enjoy them.  EXCEPT for the quality.  People aren't kidding when they say this is the worst blu-ray movie quality they've ever seen.  I don't know what the DVDs look like, but they might look about the same as this.  But if you think about it, $18 is still an ok price for 3 DVDs.  The third movie is definitely the best quality.  Some scenes have some pretty impressive Vegas scenery.

So bottom line, I still think the price is worth it, if you're paying around $18.  Under no circumstances should anyone pay over $20 for this.  It's just not good enough quality to warrant that.",1325289600,2,858,4.327044025157233

3198275,2,B000W9DSVW,"3 stars is for $ ONLY.  I got mine for $18 on Amazon.  IF this was the usual $30-$50, I would give it 1 star because of the quality of the transfer.

(For me) The first is my fav.  The second it seemed like they tried way too hard to make it confusing, and it didn't seem to really climax.  It was also plagued by over-performed acting.  The third I think they brought it back down to normalcy.  It neither had the complexity of the first nor the confusion of the second.  It was done straight.  You never asked how they did it. A bit of a snoozer though.

I forgot how disappointing the second and third movies were.  I am a huge fan of Soderbergh though and for $15 you can't complain!

Hidefdigest was right.  The first movie looks pretty good while the second 2 are awful. The picture never pops and the second 2 have so much grain it is ridiculous.  The last two movies look like dvd's.  It is like they literally took the video_ts files and put them on a blank dvd.

As for the audio, Dolby Digital 5.1 is all you get.  I kept cycling through my receiver and the BR menu looking for the TrueHD/DTS ma option.  Really?  Even Frosty the snowman on BR has True HD.  What's the deal?

If the first movie is pretty cheap on BR I would suggest picking it up and keeping your other 2 movies on DVD.  But, like I said before, $15 is not exactly breaking the bank either.",1324080000,8,1368,4.141221374045801
3198276,5,B000W9DSVW,"I've had it.  I've had it with people talking about the best trilogies of all time and leaving out this one.  Don't worry, I've heard all of the criticism already, you don't even need to waste your time.  I've heard that Ocean's Twelve is a mish-mash of witticisms and European landscapes and that Ocean's Thirteen, while on one hand is a triumphant return to Vegas, lacks the overall magic of the first film.  Well, let me just say this: you're dead wrong.  This is, without a doubt, the best and most entertaining trilogy you'll ever have the joy of laying your peasant eyes on.  Ocean's Eleven is arguably a perfect film.  I dare you to come up with a legitimate complaint with this film (don't worry, it can't be done).  Ocean's Twelve is a delightful romp through Soderbergh's cinematographic dreams, coupled with excellent performances, despite the under utilization of Bernie Mac.  Ocean's Thirteen rebuffs the obviously weaker Twelve with a stronger use of Bernie Mac and a smoother ensemble feel to the movie.  These movies, altogether, are truly masterpieces.  Don't waste your time on 15 hours of Lord of the Rings, or the Ewok song.  This is where it's at, buddy.  You're not doing much better than this.",1323216000,3,1216,4.788461538461538

3198312,5,B000W9DSVW,"This boxed set the best thing I've bought from Amazon.com to date.  I love the Ocean movies for their star-studded cast, the amazing humour, and the hundreds of other things that make these movies unique.  The extras aren't all that great, but I usually buy movies for the actual movie, not the extras...  So if a lack of stunning special features doesn't bother you, and you don't have the movies already, you should definitely get this set.  Easily worth 5-stars in my book.",1229472000,3,476,4.698795180722891

3198315,5,B000W9DSVW,Ocean11 and 12 did not have wide screen viewing. Ocean13 did. I DID NOT WANT A WIDE SCREEN DVD. I have a regular TV. How do I return this DVD for one that is not wide screen? Maybe you could just send me another one that is for regular TV and I can give this one away. Thank You.,1224374400,,279,3.7457627118644066
3198316,3,B000W9DSVW,"I enjoyed the movies my self and looked forward to the BD release, but when I put them in my player and noticed the almost DVD quality video I felt ripped off.

3198317,5,B000W9DSVW,"Got this as a gift from a friend, took it out of its bag and thought it was just Ocean's 13 in a special edition box (due to the placement of 11 and 12).  That alone would be great, but it doesn't compare to realizing I just can't read, and that all three are here. 5 stars for the product, 0 for my logic.",1222646400,3,306,3.78125

3198319,4,B000W9DSVW,"I didn't give this product 5 stars only because the extras weren't all that great, and that is important to many DVD consumers.  Ocean's Eleven has some  pretty good special features, including actor commentaries, movie documentaries, PC features, and more. Ocean's Twelve has no special features other than it's own movie trailer.  Ocean's Thirteen has a few additional scenes, and a couple casino video extras.  So, it you are a person who is looking to by this set because of special features and extras, I would look for something different.  However, I still gave this product 4 stars because I, personally, was not looking for special features, I just wanted to own all three movies in an attractive boxed set.  So, if you are just looking to own these movies because you love them, then buy this set.  If you are looking to own these movies because you haven't seen them, but heard they were good, then definitely buy this set.",1220918400,6,934,4.763975155279503

3198323,4,B000W9DSVW,"This is a good set to own, with Ocean's 11 being a classic and 13 being pretty darn good. Only Ocean's 12, which is fairly abissmal, prevents a five star rating.",1215561600,,161,4.225806451612903
3198324,4,B000W9DSVW,"I'm sure everyone has seen this series so my rating is not based on the plot or acting quality. Everything looks great in HD, of course. The problem is that because they are crooks (lovable crooks, but crooks nonetheless) their operations usually happen at night or in the dark. That means tons of film noise, which is gloriously captured in 1080p. I find that some of the night/dark shots are grainy to a point of being obvious, though not enough to annoy me. It's like two guys sitting next to you in the theater, constantly chatting away in low volumes. It doesn't distract from the movie, but you'd enjoy things a little more if it weren't there. That's the only minor imperfection I could find. Everything else is marvelous.",1215043200,58,729,4.658914728682171

The movies are great. the quality is a real let down. This review is based on the HD quality, not the review of the movie, as it should be on the Blue ray box set listing. Don't waste your money until they do a better job with the quality of the conversion",1208908800,179,455,4.101123595505618

When I received it, I was a little confused since the plastic wrapping had a sticker on it that read: ""For use only with Blu-Ray players and drives"" but sure enough, the box cover inside read ""HD-DVD"" right across the top so I opened it up.  You bet I was surprised when I found three Blu-Ray discs inside.  I guess I can't really complain much since the Blu-Ray version of this set retails for $50 where the HD-DVD set was $37.  I guess I'll sell these to some lucky BD player owner and try for an actual HD-DVD set myself.",1207612800,4,631,4.233333333333333

3198332,3,B000W9DSVW,I kind of sit on the fence with this box-set because for a blu-ray set it show a lot of grain in the picture. I think that it was intended to look that way which is also why I can't say it is realy bad. If you are a fan of the set it is a nice collection to have and that is why I bought it but is far from showing what blu-ray has to offer. The audio is also not that good but That is more because of the type of movie it is and has more dialogue and music than SFX.,1203033600,5,467,3.5

Ocean's 11 is one of my favorite movies, full of fun performances and great lines.  The other 2 films have their moments, but don't quite live up to the first one. However, Clooney, Pitt, Damon et. al. are having such a great time that the movies are always fun to watch.  Savor 11 - save 12 & 13 for less frequent viewing.",1201392000,,438,4.240963855421687

Ocean's Twelve is much better Blu-Ray quality, but the film production is highly stylized and distracting, rather 60's in the way they use different transitions, cuts and grotesque zooms. The plot is much weaker - and far less plausible - than Eleven, and the acting rather wooden at times.

The movie itself, Ocean's Thirteen, was alright. Not the greatest Ocean's movie. In my opinion the second one was a lot better. Al Pacino plays a mild role not a great role. I had a lot of good expectations for this movie but in the end it didn't live up to them. A great movie to sit and relax to over a break.",1197331200,6,473,4.031914893617022

3198350,4,B000W9DSVW,"As a new HD-DVD owner, I immediately jumped at this set. While the features for Ocean's Eleven are the same as what's out there, having it in HD is a good bonus. But, what made this a must buy were the HD exclusive features on Ocean's Twelve and Thirteen.

First, O12 includes a new commentary with Soderbergh and writer George Nolfi, a selection of additional scenes and an HBO Making-Of Special. O13 also includes a commentary with Soderbergh and writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien and a Masters of the Heist featurette (though that one is available via a bonus disc at Target I believe). Also included are additional scenes and a couple other featurettes, most in HD.

Honestly, the picture quality isn't anything great but it is good. Of course, this isn't something I'm going to use to show off my home theater but for general home viewing, I know I will be watching these over and over again (yes, even Ocean's Twelve, a movie that has grown on me over the years).

Since it's only under $20 per movie, even if you already own O11 and O12, this is still worth the upgrade.",1195862400,4,1084,4.5487179487179485

I really didn't think these movies need censorship. I mean implied violence, theft, lying, and criminal activity are all in these movies. A few swear word must be censored.
