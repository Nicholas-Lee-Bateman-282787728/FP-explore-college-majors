5256531,5,B0093SSD2C,"I have always been interested in the story and the myth of Robert Capa so this film caught my attention. From the beginning it is obvious that it was not impartial in regard of the controversy of Capa iconic Spanish Civil War photo but that did not bother me since the amount of information that the film provided for me about him and His two other partners was all new to me. The narrative is good and makes this documentay ""a must have"" for somebody interested in this theme.",1362441600,5,477,4.370786516853933

8535372,5,B0093SSD2C,"...into the future, pieces of souls of photographers, their objects and their connection.

Watching this documentary I could not help but think that photographs are messages of the present to some future time, messages to the eyes and souls of the ones who are yet to be born, instructions to some future lives, so they see, so they learn, so they do not forget and so they carry on the message.

This documentary is a work of art.",1471824000,,431,4.512820512820513

8535378,1,B0093SSD2C,"Despite having great story to tell, this documentary fails in describing how the Mexican suitcase and its contents were discovered and eventually end up in a museum in NYC. At the most, it is a brief overview of the Spanish Civil War with superficial comments about the Capa/Taro/Chim archive.",1384819200,,293,5.0
