2807731,3,B000P2A5SA,"For sure this is not a great movie, but it brings back some memories of my childhood and going to the movies with my mom and dad, watching Roy and Gabby and Trigger; later Dale.  I watched it on my Kindle and enjoyed it for what it was, a memory from a time that has passed.  But a good memory.",1384041600,,294,3.8833333333333333

The story begins with riders singing about going home. Their coats suggest winter. The Mayor delivers the mail. A mine owner has economic troubles. They need money for development; can they attract investors? There is a song in an office. Three strange men drive into town; are they hiding from the law? The group of riders sing another song. Does ""Joe Harmon"" have a bad attitude? Then another song. Racing pigeons in the barn. A dance in the hall. Then the businessmen are invited to view samples of ore from the gold mine. The value here is the high tungsten content, since it has a higher priority for the war effort. The nearest telephone is out on the highway gas station. ""Joe"" has a plan. The businessmen agree to develop the mine. Next there is another song. Joe's plan shows up to kidnap the businessmen. A toy airplane is used in the story. Roy and his friends are tied up.

Joe shows up with a story and a movie film to back up his story. [Can you believe everything you see in a movie?] A light plane drops a message for a $250,000 ransom. Roy figures out why their horses and guns were left behind. The sheriff and his men show up to catch Roy and his friends. Roy and Pat visit Carol to exchange news, then leave. The kidnappers plan to leave no witnesses to the crime. Can Roy's gang be freed from jail? Carol got the film reel to show the sheriff. Gabby delivers the ransom money and gets a surprise. Roy catches the crook on horseback. Gabby sends a carrier pigeon for help. The sheriff and his men rush to the old Barrett mine to free the kidnapped people. The gangsters plan to blow up the mine to hide the evidence. Can Roy and the sheriff arrive in time to stop them? The gunfight drops some of the crooks, two leave in a car. Can Roy stop them? Gabby shows his steel vest. There is a happy ending and the riders sing a final song.

This drama has a blend of characters for its plots. It uses a mistaken identification that is corrected, a kidnapping that is solved, and the saving of a small mining business that benefits the local economy. Plus singing and comic relief.",1283385600,,2124,4.372151898734177
2807734,3,B000P2A5SA,"Again not a full length film.  Listed as 60 minutes, it only runs for 53 minutes. No surprise, and it has the RE logo in the bottom right corner. Also a lot of the movie is dark. Given it is suppose to be dark, they could have waited for a full moon.",1200268800,7,250,3.8076923076923075
