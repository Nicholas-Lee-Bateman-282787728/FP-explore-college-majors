2072212,5,B00029RSVS,"My 17 month old loves this video. The first time we played it he sat and watched for 20 minutes. A record for him. VERY bright colors, low talking and good action. Lots of animals and scene changes. This is a video of their live show straight through and is a good 55 minutes long.",1105920000,3,281,4.127272727272727
2072213,5,B00029RSVS,"My 19mo old just loves Barney!  This DVD is a good addition to our collection.  It is a live stage show performance with lots of fun songs, and animals. (like a polar bear, an elephant, a monkey, ducks, a dog, and even a dancing starfish)  It holds her attention and is educational.  Our favorite part is the dancing polar bear with the song ""It's Gettin'Cold!"" -its an upbeat fun song to dance to. We love it, and we think you will too.",1100736000,,437,4.2926829268292686
2072214,5,B00029RSVS,Barney entertains and teaches; some of the adults out there who have such a problem with this character need to grow up.  It's for the children - not them.,1095465600,9,155,4.344827586206897

2072221,4,B00029RSVS,"My 19 month old granddaughter has learned so much from the Barney video's I've purchased.  This is her favorite, I'm not sure if it's becaue it is live and other children in the audience is her age or not.  She watches it over and over and I plan on buying Barney collections for my 11 month old grandson as well.  I would highly reccommend .",1388707200,,342,4.230769230769231

2072224,5,B00029RSVS,MY son bought this movie on his own. he is two years old and he has watched it at least 100 times a week since buying it. He loves how it incorporated all of the barney movie into a live action movie. IT WAS AWESOME>>> Now if I could only get the songs out of my head ;),1383091200,,270,3.6724137931034484
2072225,1,B00029RSVS,"I had seen this on u tube and wanted it for my grandson in the car when we travel as it was the most entertaining one of Barney I
had seen .I set it up for a trip and all it showed was adverts and then audio only followed by complete blank. So happily I only paid a little under $4.00 so I guess you get what you pay for, very very disappointed.

2072226,5,B00029RSVS,My daughter loves Barney and this is by far the least annoying DVD.  It's a live concert full of songs she loves.,1298764800,,113,4.136363636363637
2072227,5,B00029RSVS,"Originally my mom played this via netflix for my newborn. Yes, he was like 1-2 months old back then.  He's a big fan of Barney, especially this show. The only way to get him to eat/drink/stop crying is to turn on this show.  Am I spoiling my baby? Well, when you are in my position, when nothing works, you will go to the extreme to stop a crying baby. When he was 6 months old, he smiles whenever he sees the begining of the show, especially when Baby Bob rings the bell.  He enjoys it so much that we bought a portable dvd player and the disc for travelling. Or when the big tv is occupied.  I even play it in the car when my baby cries while I am driving. Although he can't see the tv, the songs calm him down.

There are no lyrics accompanied the disc but if you are like me, who watched it over and over and over again, you will have a hard time deleting the songs in your head! The backdrops in this dvd are amazing, very colorful and attractive.

I will definately bring my baby to watch Barney live if there is one in our place.

Great investment!",1298505600,,1055,4.092233009708738
2072238,5,B00029RSVS,"Hello everybody...My son is a barneyholic and we live in Ecuador...so several times I'm searching on Amazon for fun dvds for my son.  I'm a Live shows dvds' fan so that was the reason of my purchase for my son and I wasn't wrong.  It's a delicious fun for my son see the pinos (pinguins on spanish baby language), pacaos (fishes on spanish baby language), oto (bear on spanish baby language), etc...So it was a very cool purchase, thank you amazon!",1221782400,,448,4.518518518518518

2072240,5,B00029RSVS,"I had the fortune to take my kids to see this partcular show , and as soon as I saw this DVD advertised I had to have it. And there I was, tapping my feet in rhythm to the songs. The original show (albeit a tad short at 90minutes), is reproduced faithfully in this disc. The values of family, love, entertainment and of course learning, are passed on to the viewers with ease. the Barney DVDs are an endless source of education. You might hate the songs, but there is no disputing the fact that when children are having fun, they learn more. Totally recommended.",1127347200,,562,4.3619047619047615
2072241,5,B00029RSVS,"I bought this DVD when my daughter was 18 months old and already a Barney fan.  She's had this for a month and from the first viewing, it has been one of her two favorite Barney DVDs (the other one being ""Let's Play School"").  The video is of a live Barney concert, with Barney, Baby Bop, BJ, 4 children, and lot's of ""guest"" animals.  My daughter loves to watch Barney, Baby Bop and BJ interact with the children.  There is also a lot of footage of children in the audience and their reactions to the show, which my daughter also loves.  She starts dancing in anticipation of my starting the DVD and continues dancing throughout most of the hour-long video.  I've been really happy with this DVD--and we haven't even begun to explore all of the special features that are included on it.",1120780800,,787,4.468531468531468

As soon as i put this DVD in , my daughter just loved it. She is now 22 months and she imitates all the moves and sings the songs. She wants to see it all the time. We even have the CD that is how much she loves the music. The show is very colorful and the music makes you want to dance with your child.",1115164800,,307,3.5970149253731343

8024687,5,B00029RSVS,"Since I've watched that show for a few times, I've made up a new live stage show:

Filmed on North America at the Majestic Theater in Dallas, Texas, Ash, Pikachu, Fluffy the talking Riolu, and the kids (Mike, Gina, Donny, and Sarah) go on a fun road trip around the Pokemon world. They visited Cerulean city gym, the Pokemon center's playground in the Hoenn region, A royal castle, and even the Johto big city. But when their last stop turns out to be the kingdom of darkness and the evil King Darkrai plans to turns the kids' Pokemon into hypnotized Pokemon zombies, Sailor moon and Sailor mini moon came to the rescue and blasted King Darkrai off. In the end, Ash and his friends teach their new friend, Princess Luna (who was cursed by King Darkrai's powers), that she can make new friends, even though she is not a human or a Pokemon.",1526428800,,838,4.477124183006536
