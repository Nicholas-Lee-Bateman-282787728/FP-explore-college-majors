8130783,3,B000GDI2KQ,I bought this movie specifically because Roy Rogers was supposed to have a cameo role in it. I was not able to spot Roy Rogers - however it is an enjoyable western and Kenny Rogers fans will surely enjoy it.,1524787200,,207,4.2

8130786,5,B000GDI2KQ,"I enjoyed this and other The Gambler movies, and I love them all.
I am looking however, for the next part to this one.
This one, is easy to find in a 3 dvd collection, ends with Kate about to be hung.
and the movie ending with...  ""to be continued ... ""
cliff hanger for sure !

the same goes for : The Gambler: The Legend Continues.

Where to find the Continuation dvd... I have not been able to find either one yet.

If anyone knows, please tell me @
