8396083,5,B003FSSN30,I got it years ago an loved it; for the ones who say it doesn't work look at your TV and Blu-ray player. Since I like in US I have make sure the player is always looking at the NTSC video feed.,1467417600,,193,3.619047619047619
8396084,1,B003FSSN30,"Seeing there were only three reviews and all about not being able to play, I figured that possibly the issue would be fixed by now. I was wrong! It only goes as far as showing the BBC screen, then just goes to black.",1346112000,,216,4.046511627906977
8396085,1,B003FSSN30,"I am so Disappointed this doesn't play. Like others, it loads the BBC screen then defaults to the home screen of my Sony BDP-S570. I was unaware of coding and the regional issues when I purchased this.",1326240000,,201,4.45945945945946
8396086,1,B003FSSN30,"Like the other review mentioned, these disks don't work. It loads up to the BBC logo, then freezes. I thought it was a region code issue, but the disk is region free.",1325980800,,166,4.21875
8396087,5,B003FSSN30,"While I cannot comment on the actual Blu-ray features, I can comment on the series.  This is no ordinary puppet show!  In this series you delve into the lives of these crude, but entertaining critters seeing just how bizarre and off the wall things can get.  The excellent animation of the puppets along with great casting, really brings the characters to life with unique personalities.  Overall this show is addictive and very amusing for anyone with an open-mind looking for something different.  If you like this series, you may also like the Canadian comedy Puppets Who Kill.",1300060800,9,580,4.938144329896907
8396088,1,B003FSSN30,I've tried playing this product several times in my Blu-ray player.  The BBC logo will pop up but no content afterwards will play.,1288656000,2,130,4.6521739130434785
