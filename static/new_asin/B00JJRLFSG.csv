6361961,4,B00JJRLFSG,"Interesting. I watched it about 8 times. What the film fails to cover (and perhaps this is coming) is not so much the how, but the what and the why. What type of information are we looking for, and why we need to look inward. These questions (at least in my mind) still remain unanswered.
The excuse given is that we have unknown enemies within the US. The reality may well be that this idea of internal enemies is not only morally incorrect, but also completely overblown. Of particular note was the ISP provider who was given a letter, and NSL, to permit the government to see a certain e-mail on his server, without explanation. His attorney said that the American people would have been shocked to discover the why of this query.
I'm still waiting for Greenwald to deliver the documentation that Snowden gave him. That would offer us a much larger understanding of the things that our own government is looking at.

Here's my take on the legality of mass surveillance. Between the end of 2003 to about 2008, prior to the new law passed by our congress, all of this wiretapping/monitoring of internet traffic was done under a single order given by the FISA court. Apparently, our government lied to the judge at the time in order to obtain the permission to restart the program without the consent of the Attorney General, John Ashcroft, who had determined that the monitoring was a constitutional violation.

Snowden was castigated by so many people. However, I have to wonder about what specific knowledge he must have had at the time. It must have been something very ugly for him to do what he did. He had access to signals intelligence, human intelligence and was also a superuser, with super access to classified information. Whatever it was must have completely turned his stomach. Nobody goes to live abroad like that. Not unless there were some very specific reasons why he had to divulge that information.

Where was congress during all this time? Where were the courts? One might ask that question at a later date. I like Frontline products, and another one that's good on the surface is their documentary on Cheney: the Dark Side. Where are the rest of the journalists who are supposed to cover this? Other than Greenwald, Poitras, and Barton Gellman nobody seems to want to get to the truth.",1417910400,15,2307,4.719602977667494
6361962,5,B00JJRLFSG,A fascinating and spine tingling documentary that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Make sure to watch Diane Roark's interview- it is riveting.,1415059200,3,157,4.851851851851852

6361964,5,B00JJRLFSG,"I never followed NSA or Snowden. One day before release of this DVD, NPR Fresh Air interviewed the film maker as well as couple of the NSA employees who appeared in the documentary. I hardly ever hear an older male cry in an interview. To say painful and disturbing was the least that I felt so I decided to watch the documentary. This NPR documentary is three hours of pure information that I have hardly ever seen in any documentary since the film maker interviews every single player in the whole story where the whole story started since 9/11. We are not talking about just journalist but everyone in the highest position of US government except the President and the Vice President of US government. Unbelievable amount of facts that informs one how the US government operates and how different government agencies interact with each other under the two branches of the government except the Supreme Court. This documentary and the story that it covers is a much bigger story than the Watergate, much bigger and the only reason why an average US citizen probably may not be aware of the facts of the whole story - except if they were part of the story - is that the story requires the plot to be told accordingly, properly and systematically which this film maker has done superbly.

To go back to that individual who cried in the interview, the documentary exposes so many individuals who did not cry in the documentary but they certainly made me cry for their sufferings. Humans are creation of the same source and although US has a Constitution that provides the citizens of US with FREEDOM - the one gift which truly is not found anywhere else on this planet - is alive because of proud US citizens who believe in the Constitution and put their health, their life and their whole being and existence on line just to protect the Constitution which every single American is lucky to inherit, only if they happen to be lucky to value and appreciate the Constitution of United States of America. This documentary should be a requirement for any US citizen who values their privacy and needs to understand the working platform of US government.

In April of 2014, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's website quietly posted Intelligence Community Directive 119, whose implications could be devastating for journalists. Steven Aftergood explains what effect this directive could have on contact between intelligence officials and the press. Link provided in comment section.",1400025600,21,2494,4.865882352941177
6361985,5,B00JJRLFSG,"Absolutely incredible!!!  Has all the key players commenting throughout, and from both sides of the issue.

I remember years ago seeing a video online about an AT&T employee that found a secret room with a server that was filtering online traffic, suspected to be to the NSA.  When I watched it, I believed it, but thought it borderline conspiracy.  That same story was in this documentary!!!  Long ago confirmed as part of this larger program!

Totally thorough, mesmerizing- like real-life spy thriller... and a little disturbing.",1442966400,3,532,5.127906976744186
6361986,1,B00JJRLFSG,"Liberal conspiracy theory clap-trap. Nothing but innuendo; no substance as to how the NSA collects, analyzes and stores their intelligence or how it's used to thwart attacks on the United States or apprehend terrorists. I'm all for electronic privacy, but this PBS program offers no advancement of this crucial debate.",1441929600,,318,5.38

8651399,2,B00JJRLFSG,"I understand that this was filmed in 2014 and it is now 2016 but for anyone who is familiar with these programs by now - whether by research, YouTube or other movies that have come out recently regarding Snowden, etc - I really would not recommend this movie / documentary. The only interesting part is the first 20mins as I was unaware of how all these programs started... however with some research, I am sure you can figure that out on your own. If you know NOTHING about these programs or Snowden - then I suppose this would be a good buy for you.",1479340800,,551,4.3076923076923075
8651400,5,B00JJRLFSG,"Frontline does first rate documentaries.
More time should have been devoted to President Obumbles role in perpetrating the Total Surveillance States of America; he is a hypocritical charlatan speaking against The Program in 2008, yet continuing it to the present day.",1474761600,,267,5.536585365853658

8651403,5,B00JJRLFSG,"Yes..it is a disturbing history of developments after 9/11. Every regime, from every epoch, spies on citizens. In the XX century the biggest spying and the biggest suffering of citizens happened under Stalin and Hitler.
XIX century spying belongs to USA..
The documentary presents exceptionally well, that United States Presidents and other officials from NSA are not ashamed to brazenly/shamelessly lie in front of journalists and TV cameras.
It is frustrating to watch Snowden and other whistleblowers before him like Thomas Drake. They had risked almost everything in order to warn the public about NSA massive surveillance, yet they have accomplished nothing..it is clear now in 2016. The NSA undemocratic activities continue and nobody pays  attention to it anymore. At the end we are advised and  encouraged to follow more Frontline movies by subscribing to You Tube ! This really sounded very cynical in he light of this DVD content. What I mean here is, that while I type this review it is being perhaps stored somewhere for future studying. All my and yours reviews are perhaps subject for perusal by somebody from NSA..ugh...
Anyway, If you want more about Snowden - watch ""CitizenFour"". Then of course the famous ""Matrix""..well..we are not far from it.",1470182400,,1263,5.15609756097561
