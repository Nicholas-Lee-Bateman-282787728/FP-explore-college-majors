5062236,4,B0077PBPZU,"""Franklin"" was one of my favorite shows as a kid, and it still is one of my favorites. Beautifully animated and well voiced, ""Franklin"" is surprisingly accurate in its depiction of children and the types of problems that they face growing up.

This DVD collection, while containing a large amount of episodes, is NOT a complete set. In other words, the episodes are not in chronological order, and they are not all present. However, for the price, there are enough episodes here to make the purchase worth while. The autoplay feature on the discs is also very useful. It allows parents to just pop the DVD in and leave their children to watch.

For those who are curious, here is a list of the episodes the set contains:

14. Franklin's Nature Hike
15. Franklin's Starring Role
16. Franklin's Cellar

*One major let-down about this DVD set is that the episode ""Franklin's Fossil"" is on two discs, so despite the fact that the packaging advertises 44 episodes, you're really only getting 43.

Overall, I think that this set is great for anyone who just wants to have some great ""Franklin"" episodes handy. However, for hardcore collectors, you may still have to purchase more DVDs after this one. I still have yet to find a DVD with ""Franklin's Kite"" and ""Franklin's New Friend."" However, I am quite satisfied with this set and would recommend it. :)",1350777600,61,2485,4.832941176470588
5062237,5,B0077PBPZU,My son loves Franklin. We watch it on youtube but this set has some cartoons that are not on-line. A single dvd would have cost me ten dollars but i got this for fifeteen and it comes with three dvd's.,1348185600,,201,4.05
5062238,5,B0077PBPZU,"I have found it nearly impossible to purchase Franklin DVD's. There are still MANY episodes I am missing from later seasons, and I feel a bit disappointed by that. However, when I found this here on Amazon, I got so excited. I'm a cartoon fanatic and I'm very picky. Franklin is one of those sweet, calming, relaxing, wholesome cartoons I still enjoy watching.

This collection is rather large and I finally got to see episodes that were new to me as well as FINALLY have access to episodes that were not available on the very small youtube collection. I'm actually glad that I now have enough Franklin episodes on DVD to no longer need youtube (since they don't offer those later episodes either).

This is great for kids of all ages and it's a nice quiet thing to have playing in the background. I have found it to be even more pleasing if played on a rainy day while baking cookies and cakes. There's a special something to it.

I like the characters. They are familiar animals and they are more real to kids. What I mean is, Franklin isn't a complete angel. He talks back, makes poor choices, and has a lack of responsibilities of a kid. His friends have personalities that can be seen in regular kids, though some features are toned down and the animals learn the errors of their ways rather quickly.

In that case, I think Franklin is good for teaching lessons and simply to enjoy for the sheer joy of it, regardless of age.",1348012800,17,1430,4.4884615384615385
5062239,5,B0077PBPZU,I wanted to order some Franklin the Turtle DVD's for my Grand kids and was pleased to find this collection of 44 episodes. I especially like that each segment is 15 minutes. This allows for quick viewing or watching several at one sitting. What I like best is that the content is edifying and character building.,1347235200,5,312,4.589285714285714
5062240,5,B0077PBPZU,"This set is a great deal!  There are 44 classic Franklin episodes on it.  I love Franklin and that there's a great message in each episode.  The episodes are short, but there's lots of them in this set.  These are classic Franklin episodes.",1344902400,2,240,4.511627906976744
5062241,5,B0077PBPZU,"I loved watching Franklin the turtle on VHS when my oldest was little. Now I still love watching it with my youngest child. I'm glad they made a DVD box set. I just wish it was the complete collection. Nonetheless, it's still a great set for hours of viewing pleasure.",1340755200,,268,4.38

5062245,5,B0077PBPZU,"This DVD selection is one of our favorites (as far as children shows go)! Not only do our three children enjoy watching Franklin, but my husband and I enjoy it as well. And I absolutely love that it is chalk full of lessons learned - AND that Franklin himself is learning the lessons without his parents hovering over him. Great problem-solving skills can be learned from this little turtle.",1427241600,2,391,4.681159420289855

5062252,5,B0077PBPZU,"This is a great child's favorite. They use life lessons and make them into learning tools for your little ones. My daughter loves all of the Franklin movies and she is 3. Of course some of the lessons are a little advanced for her right now, but I do feel she will still be watching them in a year or two.",1413849600,,305,4.016393442622951
5062253,5,B0077PBPZU,"Was on sale and a great investment. I teach 3-year-olds and they're just loving getting to know Franklin and his friends. They watch intently and enjoy the stories. I enjoy the lessons of kindness, thoughtfulness, honesty, etc. that go along with Franklin. Really good value, with so many episodes!",1410566400,,298,5.1020408163265305
5062254,5,B0077PBPZU,"Franklin is a wonderful show. My brothers and I enjoyed it, as did my oldest, and now, my youngest does too. I love that I was able to buy a collection because Nick Jr. doesn't really show these any more.",1410220800,,204,4.125

5062257,5,B0077PBPZU,I love this video. My kids actually get quiet and watch these videos. I can't say the same about others. Franklin has a more relaxed tone to it and it shows in my two boys. They get quiet and watch. Other shows have them more in an excitable state which makes it hard to get any work done.,1397606400,,289,4.0
5062258,4,B0077PBPZU,"My 3 year old grandson selects which of his Dvd's he wants to watch.

5062261,4,B0077PBPZU,"I love Franklin, It brings me comfort, especially since my dad passed away in March. I'm 18 years old, and here to say that you are never too old for your old favorite little kid shows..they are the best and the most comforting. the only negative things I have to say is that there are two of the same episode on seperate dvds..and that I wish there were unlimited episodes and that I could spend my whole entire life watching my favorite little kid shows..Because adulthood is horrible o.o",1373328000,4,490,4.51685393258427

8511933,5,B0077PBPZU,Besides some obviously sexual hidden things that adults would pick up on- this is great for kids. I'm not one to notice hidden things- I never picked up on Disney;s hidden things but some of the Franklin ones were obvious even to me. I don't think they are frequent and obvious to the point where my kids shouldn't watch them but it makes me angry that something innocent can be a dirty thing for animators to do secretly. Its not accidental as it takes a frame by frame drawing for these things to occur. Rant over.,1430697600,,516,4.385416666666667
