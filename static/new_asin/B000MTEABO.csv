2747847,5,B000MTEABO,"I watched this short film yesterday for the first time at a meeting/seminar and was overwhelmed. AWESOME, I plan to invest my own dollars to purchase this dvd and bring it to work for my Admin to watch.",1332374400,,202,4.342105263157895
2747848,5,B000MTEABO,I've been using White Face as part of company diversity training for many years.  This is a terrific way to get the message across and helps get the discussion started.,1285372800,4,168,4.6
2747849,5,B000MTEABO,"I worked for a large company that would hold meetings to improve office relationships. I was thinking, as I watched the movie, how perfect this would be to show at one of those meetings. The movie is not very long and shows how people discriminate without thinking. A GOOD MOVIE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE!!!!",1263686400,5,302,4.611111111111111
2747850,5,B000MTEABO,We purchased this video for my company's diversity training.  It was a good choice.,1234137600,6,83,4.928571428571429
2747851,5,B000MTEABO,"This short film powerfully portays both the brazen and subtle prejudices that we accept as part of daily life.  People are so easily categorized and stereyped by careless langauge and learned attitudes!  Through the images and scenarios presented using Clowns, we are cautioned about the insidiousnous of prejudice and the danger of complacency.  ""White Face"" is straightforward enough to share with elementary school children, yet sophisticated enough to provoke discussion at the university level.  Congratulations to Brian McDonald for creating a great film which teaches, inspires and perhaps, helps to make the world a better place.",1189555200,26,637,5.604166666666667
8172058,5,B000MTEABO,ExcellentT The irony of this short is discussion provoking as well as hilarious!,1467676800,,80,5.230769230769231
8172059,5,B000MTEABO,"Outstanding!
This video is part of a well-designed diversity training program. Unfortunately, the complete course is expensive and difficult to find. I bought the 14-minute DVD training aid to augment my diversity training course, which I used to train law enforcement professionals with positive feedback noted. It's great for a variety of audiences as it will not offend most. I recommend it for mature audiences as vulgar language is seldom used.",1425513600,,449,5.338028169014085
8172060,5,B000MTEABO,"BUY this!!! Although this can be considered a teaching tool, it is really a DISCOVERY tool  and a MUST Have!!! White Face is the most amazing film, thoughtfully and beautifully produced, and is great for unpacking the concepts of stereotypes, prejudice, diversity, etc. in the classroom, the workplace, non-profit organizations, etc. It does a fantastic job of showing rather than telling and I truly cannot recommend it too highly! Briefly, White Face is a short but extraordinarily moving film that manages to get around _all_ kinds of viewers' defenses and denial of all sorts of issues related to everyone's engagement with the ""Other"" in our culture and society. When this video is sold as part of the training package ""Clown"" (aka ""Clown: Behind the Stereotypes"") for diversity training purposes, the training company adds a few PowerPoints and lessons plans and charges $400 for the package!!! I am _thrilled_ to have found the film itself for this price!!! I've used this with college students in the classroom, civic group presentations, trainings for both health professionals and paraprofessionals, etc. and it would also be a great choice for high school junior and seniors.",1417219200,,1186,5.209424083769633
8172061,5,B000MTEABO,"This is the shortest ""movie"" I've ever seen, at just 15 minutes in length, yet it is one of the best.
This was made in the year 2000 according to the copyright, but it remains as pertinent today as it was 14-15 years ago.
It shows problems that minorities deal with, that most any ethnic group can relate to.
I use it among peer groups when discussing diversity.  It goes over pretty well.
It creates empathy for those treated unfairly for their race.
It's also funny while being thought-evoking.
I wish there were more videos like this one!",1398988800,,541,4.520408163265306
8172062,5,B000MTEABO,Excellent short video for adolescents and adults.  Use it in conjunction with Jane Elliotts' Blue Eyed for cultural diversity training and education.,1389398400,,149,5.7727272727272725
8172063,5,B000MTEABO,This is an excellent short film.  The DVD shows well.  It very well written and acted.  Hits home with related characters and scenarios.  Excellent for work conversations on diversity.,1376956800,,184,5.241379310344827
8172064,4,B000MTEABO,I purchased the video after watching it in a group setting.  It provides a different tool to utilize when discussing diversity other than racially.,1354147200,,147,5.125
8172065,5,B000MTEABO,"I do a lot of diversity education and awareness training and this is very simple but HIGHLY effective way to get people talking about difference.  I used this video with college students as well as adult groups, however, it can be used with youth as well.",1350086400,,255,4.543478260869565
8172066,3,B000MTEABO,Oh MY!!  Beware buyer. Know your audience well or you will offend employees.  This was an interesting film however it contained many swear words! Due to the language this film was deemed inappropriate to show our workforce.,1348185600,2,223,5.0
8172067,5,B000MTEABO,"I bought this DVD for a graduate class I was teaching on Diversity in the Classroom. It was a perfect way to encourage my students--all of whom were teachers or becoming teachers--to recognize that diveristy is not a joke. Nor are there easy answers. Comments one may casually make can hve a lasting impact upon a child. I currently teach in an adult college program and I work with students from minority and urban backgrounds. Again, White Face provides a bridge for me to open discussion about diversity, which is not simply an issue of race or ethnicity but of many different layers of society.",1344124800,2,598,4.704761904761905
