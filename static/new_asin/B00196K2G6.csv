That being said, when I purchased this DVD, I was looking for something that would give me visual tips on skating and an understanding of the game of hockey.
Presented in a rushed manner, the DVD presents drills, drills, drills. There are no skills presented that I could learn from, those were already assumed. The timing of each ""segment"" is extremely tight and does not lend itself to a novice like myself learning anything of value. There is absolutely no instruction on learning to play hockey. It is all centered around giving a coach new drills to take to their team for practicing.",1241308800,,719,4.76
