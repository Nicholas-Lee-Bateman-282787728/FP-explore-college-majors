1669790,5,B00005V1Z8,"I LOVE this video. It's as if Nickelodeon tapped into my thoughts and put all my favorite episodes, and one of my new favorites, on video...wait, they did! (Except for that whole mind-tapping thing...)
RIPPED PANTS- Another trademark Spongebob episode, with another catchy, wonderful song in it...
SB-129- An enjoyable, hilarious episode that shows the imagination of the writers.
TEXAS- Another episode with a tune, this one's for the Texans! Be sure to listen to Spongebob and Patrick's impressions of the great state, it's hilarious.
THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT- This episode, never-before-seen till the video, is by far the funniest episode of Spongebob I've ever seen...or one of the most. The ending of this ""creepy"" episode is hysterical...for those young at heart, at least.
SOMETHING SMELLS- For those who ever forgot a Tic-Tac.
Though it looks juvinille, this video is more than just the potty humor of Saturday Morning...it's hilarious.",1016668800,5,939,5.308724832214765
1669791,5,B00005V1Z8,I am 33 with 2 kids ages 3 and 7 and I LOVE Spongebob!!! I think it is a great cartoon for kids of all ages.  My kids and I watch it whenever it is on and I even get up early to see it. Thanks to Nick for coming up with such a great idea for kids that is neither violent or demeaning.,1013990400,4,284,3.4375
1669792,5,B00005V1Z8,"Spongebob is the best!!! He has the most hilarious show! It also teaches a good lesson in the end. I urge you to buy this movie and watch the show. It is the funniest and best show i've ever seen in my life. I may be 12 but i know what im talking about! Even my mom loves this show! She's 40! Whenever we have a family get together, when spongebob comes on everybody watches it and we all sing along with the theme song too! It's the BEST show EVER!!

7955905,5,B00005V1Z8,"Love this!!!!! Great VHS or DVD to buy.
Ripped Pants- Spongebob and Sandy are at Goo Lagoon and Larry the Lobster challenging them to lifting weights. Spongebob then rips his pants, and goes on using the joke and going a bit too far....
SB-129- Squidward wants peace from Spongebo and Patrick and gets a time machine taking him to the future and then the past
Texas- Sandy is feeling homesick so Spongebob and Patrick try to bring Good Ol' Texas to Bikini Bottom. But of course, it diverts into a lot of Texas puns and comments
Graveyard Shift- MY FAVORITE EPISODE OF ALL TIME!! Spongebob and Squidward are forced to work the nightshirt and Squidward tells Spongebob a tale about a Hash Slinging Slasher and all of the things he told start to come true
Something Smells- Spongebob makes a pretty nasty sundae and gets the ""Ugly""
Nice movie highly recommended!!!!!!",1366070400,3,864,4.728476821192053

7955909,5,B00005V1Z8,"This is one of the gretest spongebob videos ever released on both DVD and VHS tape besides the season box sets.

  The Episodes on here are ""Bubble Stand"" in which Sponge and Pat set up a road-side stand where they teach Squidward to blow bubbles, ""Texas"" in which Sandy gets homesick for Texas (where she comes from), ""SB-129"" in which Spongebob goes back in time 1,000 years and then forward in time about 1,000 years, ""Something Smells"" in which Spongebob makes a nasty-smelling sundae and when people start to run from him and his francid breath Spongebob thinks everybody thinks he's ugly, and ""The Graveyard Shift"" (my favorite episode on this disc), in which Spongebob and Squidward must work the night shift all night and live out a ghost story that Squidward thought was fake.

  OVERALL: I suggest (BUY)ing (THIS)!

  However, if you can, I would recommend that you pick up the season box sets (1, 2, 3, 4 vol. 1, 4 vol. 2, 5 vol. 1). unless you are a Spongebob nerd/ Spongebob DVD/VHS junkie and just long to have everything SB-related, then THIS UP AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!",1207353600,2,1082,4.62303664921466

Scoring:
5 Stars:  Kids - They love Sponge Bob and all his quirky friends!
5 Stars  Parents - Shows are good basic fun.
4 Stars  Violence - minimal violence, lots of slapstick
2 Stars  Educational - Won't get that here!
Summary:
""Sponge Bob"" is a lovable, fun loving sponge who gets into ridiculous situations with his less than dumb best friend ""Patrick Star"" (starfish) in their hometown of ""Bikini Bottom"".
Other Characters:
Adding to the mix are a bunch of real characters like:
""Gary"", Sponge Bob's pet snail that purrs like a cat;
""Sandy Cheeks"", a happy and sociable squirrel who lives under water;
""Mr. Crabs"", the money hungry owner of the Crusty Crab;
""Squidward"", Sponge Bob's art loving, boring, nasal neighbor who despises Sponge Bob's ridiculous antics;
""Plankton"", the tiny loud mouthed, one-eyed, single celled, megalomaniac who tries to steal Mr. Crab's crabby patty ""secret recipe"";
Scare Factor:
None, except that you and your kids  might become addicted!
Violence:
Much better than the Bugs Bunny antics we grew up on; the characters show minimal violence towards each other, but enthrall themselves in their hilarious comedic situations.
Also see ""Sponge Buddies"".",1021680000,2,1187,5.161458333333333
