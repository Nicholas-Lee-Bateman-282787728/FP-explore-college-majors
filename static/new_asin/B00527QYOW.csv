4526969,4,B00527QYOW,"""If we can't talk to each other then what is the point of us?"" While their friends are having fun and wind up leaving them alone Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter (Sturgis) begin a friendship that grows over time. This movie follows the two on the date of July 15th from 1978 to 2011. Each year on that day the meet each other and catch up with each other. This is a definite ""chick-flick"" type movie but I did actually enjoy this. The movie starts off and grabs you and keeps you interested for the entire time, even though it tends to drag quite a bit in the the middle. The last half hour though makes you glad that you continued to watch and made it till the end. The movie, while being good has the type of ending that sticks with you and makes you think long after it's over. This movie has the feel of ""Atonement"" so if you enjoy movies like that then this will be one for you. Overall, a definite chick flick that some guys may like, or at least I think so. I also may be the only one. I give it a B+.

4526970,4,B00527QYOW,"I loved David Nicholls' book of the same name.  I love the work of Lone Scherfig (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilbur-Wants-to-Kill-Himself/dp/B00068S3IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Italian-for-Beginners/dp/B00006ADFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Italian for Beginners</a>).  David Nicholls wrote the screenplay.  The ever-lovable Anne Hathaway stars in it.  This combination seemed like it added up to sure-fire box office success.  I saw the movie in a sneak preview and thought it delivered on all that promise.  To me, Nicholls had successfully boiled the essence of his novel into two hours of tight story-telling.

So much for sure-fire success: 'One Day' bombed at the box office.  There's no way to finesse that - you don't make a movie with names of this caliber, come away with less than $14 million in U.S. box office receipts, and pronounce yourself pleased with the results.

Why the pratfall?  I can think of a short list of things:

1) NOT your typical Rom-Com: Those who went thinking they'd get a light Rom-Com were in for a shock.  There's a far deeper, more serious tale taking place here.

2) Stunning, abrupt denouement: The twist of fate that suddenly befalls Hathaway's Emma isn't something mainstream U.S. audiences would expect of their romantic lead.

3) Dexter's sliding likability: Jim Sturgess's Dexter starts off likable - he's the popular man on campus.  Nicholls' book tracks Dexter's 20-year slide to dissolution, while Emma's path inexorably arches upwards past him, from ugly duckling to attractive, winsome success (Anne Hathaway's calling card for over a decade).  These dual, compelling transformations makes for compelling reading.  On screen, though, the adult Dexter becomes increasingly unlikable.

4) Anne Hathaway as a Brit: I'm an Anne Hathaway fan, but I never bought into her as British.  The whole time I thought: ""That's Anne Hathaway trying on a British accent.""  Never thought I'd say this but...Anne Hathaway, you're no Renee Zellweger.

For those of you who passed this up in the theater, I do recommend you check this out for home viewing...just don't expect an hour and 47 minutes of lighthearted fluff.",1321488000,51,2299,5.742603550295858
4526971,2,B00527QYOW,"As someone who counts Stanley Donen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-for-the-Road/dp/B000AP04MO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two for the Road</a>&nbsp;as one of his all-time favorite films, I was hoping this 2011 romantic drama might transcend its time-spanning gimmick of using one day every year - July 15 - as the touchstone for a couple who appear destined for happiness together but not without a lot of emotional curveballs and unforeseen detours. It doesn't. In fact, the film's structural conceit heightens the contrivances that keep the viewer from fully investing in the fate of what the filmmakers would like us to believe are soul mates. It's really impossible to calibrate why this mismatched pair continues to connect over the years other than to fulfill the cardboard dimensions of David Nicholls' verbose screenplay, which is in turn based on his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2009-book/dp/B0036S4CTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2009 book</a>.  The lugubrious result makes for particularly disappointing cinema given that the film was directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig, who helmed Carey Mulligan's star-making turn in the far more satisfying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Education/dp/B002ONC9NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Education</a>&nbsp;(2009).

The story begins on the night of July 15, 1988 when recent Edinburgh University graduates Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew end up spending the night together. She comes from a working-class background and is consequently smart and caustic but insecure as evidenced by the pair of granny glasses she constantly wears. He comes from money and has the cocky manner befitting someone whose shallow aim in life is to become famous since he's already rich. They connect for no apparent reason from the outset and start a friendship that borders on codependency. We see them every year thereafter on the same day as they grow from young adulthood to early middle age. Emma stumbles out of the gate becoming increasingly depressed working at a Mexican restaurant in London. Dexter finds fame as the sleazy host of a VH1-type entertainment-lite program. She eventually finds her footing as a writer, while he goes through a drug-induced tailspin. Their up-and-down lives intertwine at defining moments when something decisive happens to one, and the other has to cope with whatever the new situation is. The film repeats this pattern so often that it becomes redundant and tiresome even when an inevitable plot device occurs late in the story.

I can see why an actress as engaging as Anne Hathaway would be drawn to a part like Emma because she gets to play a wide range of shades and emotions in her character's arc, but there are two things that are off-kilter about her performance. First, her pinched English accent sounds entirely too close to her take-off of Mary Poppins from her guest appearance on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Live/dp/B004DH7XI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Live</a>&nbsp;to be believable. Second, her naturally vibrant presence doesn't lend credibility to the early scenes when she appears to be doing a cheeky throwback to the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Diaries/dp/B00006L948/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Diaries</a>&nbsp;movie. She also makes co-star Jim Sturgess (Jude in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B002G1K82Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>) look all the more pallid as the pitiable Dexter. He seems to be channeling Hugh Grant in order to evoke the charm necessary to attract Emma, but he suffers even more from the story's thumbnail-sketch approach. As Emma's failed love interest Ian, Rafe Spall is convincingly annoying as an aspiring stand-up comic without any talent, while Romola Garai has the thankless role of Dexter's humorless lover-turned-wife. Both appear to be playing stock characters for the sake of the central love story. At least Patricia Clarkson lends her requisite lan as Dexter's worldly mother, but her scenes are all too brief. Despite a clever time-shifting scene at Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, the film left me dry-eyed wanting to see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-for-the-Road/dp/B000AP04MO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two for the Road</a>&nbsp;again.",1320537600,8,4598,6.534426229508196
4526972,4,B00527QYOW,"I have not yet seen the blu-ray. I just saw the movie in theatres. Many times. But I am anxiously awaiting the blu-ray release. It looks like the blu-ray will have all the featurettes available on the film's official web site, as well as deleted scenes. I can't tell what the aspect ratio will be. I'm hoping it won't be letterbox, and that it will fill up the whose screen on an HD flat screen.

If you've read the book, you know this is not a typical happily-ever-after Hollywood romance a la The Notebook. But that is one of the things I love most about it. It has a real, genuine feel to it. Emma, serious-minded, nerdy, wise-cracking and adorable in her insecurity, and Dex, a privileged cad who goes through women like kleenex, are two young people who officially meet on the day they graduate from University, after Emma has crushed on Dex from afar. Their romance was not meant to get off the ground that day, however. But the seeds are sown for a long and abiding friendship that lasts for the next 20 years. We get to check in on what's going on with them one day a year, the anniversary of the day they met. The relationships, not just between Em and Dex, but between Dex and his parents, his wife, his child, Emma's relationship with Ian, and how they each grow through these relationships, are the real heart of this movie. It's really about two ordinary lives in progress, which lends credence to the notion that everyone has an interesting story to tell. Unlike most romances, the main question of the movie is not ""will they get together/stay together"" but rather ""how does their love for each other color the decisions they make and help them through the ups and downs of their individual lives?"" and most importantly, ""was it all worth it?"" As the last scene fades, we know the answer to the last question is a resounding ""of course it was.""

In my opinion, most of the criticism thrown at this movie was simply groundless. 1)Anne Hathaway's accent. It's not Gwyneth Paltrow flawless, but it's serviceable and doesn't detract from the story. 2) Anne's character Emma is bland. I see this criticism basically from men. I guess they mean she's not ""hot."" She's not. She's not supposed to be. She's pretty, but is a bit of a late bloomer. She's smart, spunky, insecure, a three-dimensional character with a soul to soul connection with Dex. That's what keeps them together. 3) Dex is unsympathetic. He's a spoiled playboy who gets lost, as some overprivileged people do, but finds his way back. He creates many of his own problems, but is a good person. We can see that he is underneath it all, the same way his mother does. It's seeing how he grows into the man she knows he can be that is part of the movie's charm and impact. 4) No chemistry between the leads. Uh, there were times when I actually felt heat coming off the screen. Jim Sturgess was also convincing and stunning as Dex and does an amazing job not only aging but maturing Dex and showing his emotional growth. I thought I developed a crush on Jim when I saw him in Across The Universe. But this movie takes it to a whole new level.

The editing is the one weak spot in this movie. Some of the early scenes feel a bit truncated, leaving a few later scenes feeling a bit unexplained. It doesn't flow quite as nicely as Scherfig's last film, An Education. But the story is much more engaging and entertaining, and the characters are much more likeable and relatable.

All in all, I found it to be a very satisfying romance whose ending is very life affirming, and it left me with a swelling in my heart, a smile on my face and a little tear in my eye all at the same time.",1317772800,139,3651,4.452914798206278

4526974,4,B00527QYOW,"One Day is one of those films that you will either just ""get"" or you won't. It's either your cup of tea or it isn't. It was most definitely my cup of tea.

Based on the David Nicholls novel of the same name, the story follows college pals Emma and Dex and their relationship over the 20 years following their graduation, but we only get to see the relationship one day out of the year, the day they met. Emma secretly (and sometimes not so secretly) loves him. He loves her, too, but just doesn't know it yet. Picture a serious version of When Harry Met Sally. However, what I liked best about this film is that it's about two lives, not about a perfect, happily-ever-after Hollywood ending. It's about lives in progress. Sad, tragic things happen, but the ending is strongly life-affirming. The characters are not especially tragic or sympathetic, they are just people, like any other people you would meet in everyday life. And it doesn't end wrapped up in a nice, lovely, idyllic bow, just the way you hoped it would, like The Notebook.

The subtle human touches are the life of this film, and I had to see it more than once to catch all of them. Like when Dex's mother expresses her concern for her son's future and his lifestyle choices. Later, when Dex's father tells him mom would be proud, in order to make Dexter feel better, Dex knows it's not true. And the irony of Dex's distant relationship with his father, who ends up giving Dex the best, most helpful advice he could have received.

The love between these two characters takes years to get off the ground, but that makes it all the more moving when it finally happens. The chemistry between the leads Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess is palpable as well. There are times you can almost feel the heat coming off the screen.

The editing is really the one weak spot in the film. Scenes were cut short in the interest of time that left later scenes feeling a bit unexplained. It doesn't flow as nicely as Scherfig's last film An Education, but the story is much more engaging, charming and moving, and the characters much more relatable and likeable. I enjoyed this film far more than An Education.

It's a romance, so by its very nature the audience is females, either teens or middle aged women starved for a little romance. For me, this film delivered big time.",1314748800,13,2325,4.526190476190476
4526975,3,B00527QYOW,"I've been thinking about this movie and writing this review for a long time when I first heard the premise of a couple getting together every year, afterwards I was intrigued by it. In 1978 there was a movie called Same Time, Next Year which had the same premise, but after seeing One Day I was kind of disappointed in how it turned out.

July 15th, 1988 Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) graduate from college, during the drunken revelries they discover each other, spend the night together and start a twenty year friendship. One Day revisits them every year on this anniversary, to see where they are in their lives and in their relationship with each other, and in their relationships with other people. Like a lot of friendships between men and woman over the years, Emma and Dexter flirt with each other and with romance, but usually something intervenes to interrupt their path to romance.

Although Hathaway and Sturgess are both strong in their roles, the movie seems overly long in places and Dexter isn't a sympathetic character, even after he realizes what he's been looking for all these years was right there in Emma. I also didn't feel a lot of connection with the characters, who actually fell in love on the first meeting.

The movie tries to use a literary conceit in mentioning St Switun's Day, which legend has it that whatever the weather is on July 15th it will be the same for the next 40 days. It was never made clear how this might apply to the characters or situations they find themselves in. The screenplay for One Day was written by the novel's author, David Nicholls, and I assume it's a good representation of his novel. The movie was shot and is set in Scotland, London and Paris and makes the most of the romantic feel of those places, especially Paris.

One Day isn't a bad movie but it doesn't draw you in enough, there are moments when you laugh and cry, but Emma and Dexter keep you at arms length.",1313971200,,1948,4.573065902578796

4526977,5,B00527QYOW,"Based on the novel by David Nicholls, the film adaptation of One Day offers a glimpse of the non-romantic relationship of university acquaintances or the male-female version of bff's between Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) and Emma Morely (Anne Hathaway) that spanned from 1986-2006.  However, the first few scenes already show an existence of an undercurrent of romance despite the promise that the two made to strictly to remain platonic friends.  And with most novels that have been adapted to film, it is no surprise that some important elements have been left out and others remain in order to provide an effective film and storyline that attempts to closely resemble what is included in the book.  But nevertheless, the film keeps the main premise of novel and the fascinating relationship that develops between Dexter and Emma in place.

One Day is an extremely enlightening film that bears comparison to other romantic-dramatic films that have a tint of humor on the side, When Harry Met Sally, and the numerous Woody Allen films, Bridget Jones Diary, and on the dramatic side, the film resonates into a Nicholas Sparks novel.  But what is interesting about this film as opposed to the list above, the characters of Dexter and Emma are unique like the tattoo mark on Dexter's ankle that represents the yin and yang, opposites that tend to compliment the universe; indeed, the film shows that energy in the form of creativity and array of emotions that may have viewers laughing one moment and crying the next because there exists a bit of empathy for the characters, especially for Dexter as he appears most confident during the beginning of the film but later dwindles within the last hour.  But by the end of the film, he is able to overcome the tragedies that had come his way.

Although One Day may not be an unpredictable film because of the foreseen events that take place within each particular scene, viewers will see how Dexter and Emma have progressed within their lives.",1313884800,2,1986,4.892857142857143

But this one, it was a complete let down, as it did the exact opposite of what I was expecting from it. I wanted a light enjoyable rom-com, and this just left me in a very melancholy mood.

It had a promising start, as it showed this relationship grow over the years, and I was all for it, because we have too many movies that only focus on the initial giddy years of a relationship, and I felt like this was doing something different. But without giving out any spoilers, all I can say is that - this turned out to be far worse and kinda pointless.

Later:  next day I found myself thinking about the film, not something I usually do for a standard rom-com.  I want to revise my opinion about the script.  I think it works very well to show something deeper than a traditional romance.  The only minus as I think about the film now is the characterization of Ian, Hathaway's sometime boyfriend.  He's way too shaggy and silly to be taken seriously as a love interest.  It's a small flaw, though in this generally well done drama.",1455840000,,743,4.5606060606060606

4527073,4,B00527QYOW,"One day is the story of two friends whom are obviously attracted to one another but have struggles and  are much different. If you expect a romantic film, do not bother, if you want to watch a story that will leave you thoughtful and with a broken heart, then enjoy.

Overall, the acting is believable (of course it's Anne Hathaway) the visuals are fabulous, however the story develops slow and somewhat tedious. One wishes to hit the forward button to get to the supposedly ""happy ending"" -_-  there's really no romance, just the growth and changes of two friends and their sad life. I kept telling myself ""why the heck aren't they together already.its obvious they're in love"" They don't change each other's life, just whine and whine to one another. Then finally, when they are together for the first time, the writers decide it was not worth to share with the viewers the ultimate moment by using visuals, instead they talked it over!!!wonderful!! That removes the romance category I'm sure. In conclusion,the movie is a must watch for the crowd who wish to bawl like babies, heaven knows I cried like a five year old. To those who can't support pain, and the faults of a couple, then go someplace else. In the end this movie got my hate, anger, chuckles and tears all in one day. ;)",1446854400,,1287,4.611353711790393

For the rest of us, old broken down romantics, etc. that lived thru the years covered by this movie, it is very hard to watch, but so powerful you can't take your eyes off of it.  David Nicholls' fine script is possibly one of the best depictions of heartbreak, waste, and regret I have ever seen*, and I've seen an innumerable amount of it on screen during 67 + years of loving motion pictures.  There is so much pain in One Day, but there are great flashes of love, tenderness, and joy, as well, thanks in great part to the impeccable performance of Anne Hathaway.  One cannot take one's eyes off of her! She makes the film's high times thrilling, and the low times come alive, but she shines brightest of all during the high times.

I feel that any of you that love French film would find it hard not to like this movie.  It tore my heart out, but I am so glad to have been able to experience it, and experience Anne Hathaway's powerful talent.

4527204,5,B00527QYOW,"The first time I watched this, I was a little disappointed. I love Anne Hathaway and I thought I was watching another feel-good movie of hers. Of course, this is not your typical American romance film so I was a little let-down. I enjoyed it the first time but I didn't appreciate the real value to it. I recently re-watched it and I loved it! I was able to watch it for what it really is and not what I anticipated it to be. Please give this movie a try, maybe two! Anne Hathaway's accent is a little distracting but not enough to take from the overall movie.",1415059200,,560,4.194444444444445

4527206,2,B00527QYOW,"So, the critics call this movie a comedy. Well, it took me a college English class to learn that 'comedy' means 'tragedy.' After one day together - July 15th, 1988, their college graduation - Emma Morley poignantly played by Anne Hathaway and Dexter Mayhew (more like Mayhem?) admirably portrayed by Jim Sturgess-- start a friendship that lasts through many years. Years they waste before HE finally realizes Emma is the love he has been looking for--something that Emma knew all along. Through the years finally, Emma does discover her one dream of making the world a better place. She becomes a schoolteacher. Still, she settled for a mediocre relationship with a man she did not love while waiting for the man of her dreams--the wealthy, arrogant, self-centered charmer who left her hanging for so many years that perhaps it is why she had difficulty having a child. All those years Emma and Dexter wasted. Then, they finally find their dream come true--only to have it snatched away. Emma never realizes her real dream--of becoming a mother. We the audience were left hanging for over an hour, anxiously waiting for this star-crossed couple to get together and then tragedy strikes and fate deals its cruel hand. If you like tragic endings, I recommend for YOU this movie.",1411516800,,1276,4.912037037037037

4527252,2,B00527QYOW,"This movie starts out with so much potential to be a great romance...And then in the final 30 minutes there's needless tragedy that, quite honestly, pissed me off and reminded me of Remember Me with Robert Pattinson - which I also loved...until the final 15 minutes.  (People who have watched Remember Me should understand what I'm referencing.)  If you're looking for a feel-good romantic movie, do NOT watch this.  It winds up being heart-breaking, sad, and disappointing in the end.  I understand the poignancy they were going for, but when someone has suffered quite a bit in a movie, it seems heartless to throw in more last-minute tragedy just for shock value.  There was some resolution after the HUGE moment of disappointment, but not enough to redeem the entire movie.  I walked away feeling much like the male lead did near the end - like I'd just been teased with this epic love story and then got sucker-punched and was left feeling angry, confused and bereft.  Not a good way to end up feeling after getting your hopes up for something that, up to the last 1/4 of the movie, was on its way to becoming one of my favorite movies.  Now I'm annoyed that I invested the time watching it.",1402358400,10,1196,4.6350710900473935

Naturally, I was afraid of watching the movie adaptation for fear it would ruin the book. The movie was not a disaster but I didn't have the same witty, wonderful, humorous experience as I did with the book. I liked it and was particularly impressed by Anne Hathaway's accent - she nailed it. The soundtrack, the clothes, the hairstyles - absolutely pitch perfect - all instantly took me to the different years with amazing specificity.

4527270,1,B00527QYOW,This movie is stupid. It isn't above love as much as it is about sexual awkwardness and stupidity. Waste of your time.,1397260800,5,118,4.409090909090909

4527272,5,B00527QYOW,"I honestly didn't know what to expect with this movie and as it turns out the trailer is not very indicative of the movie's content.  I was so pleasantly surprised. I thought the movie was a little slow-moving but in the end it was very true to real life.  In the end I realized that if it didn't include all of the seemingly boring bits it wouldn't have all tied together so nicely. If you decide to give this movie a try, please watch through to the end- you'll be glad you did.

Another disclaimer- this is probably more enjoyable for women than men. Some men will watch romantic comedies in hopes of at least seeing a hot actress in a sex scene or flitting around barely clothed. This movie was more about an emotional  connection rather than physical, which is what makes it so romantic.",1396828800,,792,4.404109589041096

I'm just kidding!  You need to laugh after this movie.  It was a good romantic movie.  Realistic in it's message to all of us that you can't afford to play those ""heart games"" with life.  The notion that there will be time to correct the mistakes is an illusion.  Time is unmerciful. If you're fortunate enough to find someone worthy of loving in this world, you had better recognize it and act on it right then.

What?  I'm a man and we don't talk like this?  Some of us do.  It's not just about that other thing.  Romance and the other thing are like peanut butter and jelly.  Both are good.  But put them together and you have something unique.  Something fantastic.  Something you can't live without.  If you like a bittersweet love story . . . Watch this one.  The story is touching.  The theme music is beautiful.  And the message is real.

The character of Emma Moriarity, a mousy young aspiring writer, played by Miss Anne Hathaway was so compelling that I am writing this review as a tribute to her portrayal.  Dexter, as her man-child friend and love interest, shows character development as he grows and matures during the unfolding story.  I would call it a kind of sad love story, depicting how tentative life can be, which got me into trouble with my woman whom this film affected so strongly because my chrome plated heart was more inured than hers to the charms of this movie.

4527360,4,B00527QYOW,"If you've seen films like Forest Gump, you know what time-jumping in Hollywood is like.  This film specifically jumps from year to year in two people's lives, always landing on July 15th, the day they met, and looking in on how they are doing.  Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess star in this adaption of the best-selling novel and I have to say I enjoyed the chemistry between them, even when they were fighting.  I feel that this chemistry was what kept the film afloat as, given the length of the plot, others came and went throughout their lives, leaving the pair as the only constants.  If you're looking for a love story with a Disney-like plot complete with a happy ending and a horse, you'll be dissappointed.  Me, I'm the opposite.  I always enjoy a film that defies the stereotypical.  True, I was rooting for these two kids to make it, but this ending was far better and more powerful than I could have imagined (I won't say more as to not spoil it.)  And if you're a red-blooded American, you'll find this film interesting just based on the fact that it doesn't take place in the United States and therefore addresses little to none of our country's history...it's time to expand your minds.  But in the end, it's a solid film to be enjoyed, even if critics had problems with Anne Hathaway's accent.  Also, you'll see a Tex-Mex type resteraunt in the middle of London (gotta admit...didn't see that one coming.)",1379462400,,1419,4.595238095238095

4527366,5,B00527QYOW,"One Day is the movie based on the novel of the same title by British author, David Nicholls. The day referred to in the title is St. Swithin's Day, July 15th, and the movie shows what is happening in the lives of two people, Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley, each year on that day as well as referring to significant events of the preceding year. Emma and Dexter are first encountered on the day after their graduation and are followed through twenty years of life: relationships, career highs and lows, personal crises, addictions, weddings, marriages, divorces, extramarital affairs, parenthood, resounding successes and abysmal failures, loss of significant family members, loneliness, cohabitation and physical ageing all feature. Emma is well portrayed by Anne Hathaway; Jim Sturgess is excellent as Dexter; Rafe Spall, Patricia Clarkson and Ken Stott deserve special mentions as Ian,  Dexter's mother Alison Mayhew and Dexter's father Steven. Young Eden and Kayla Mendelgrein play Jasmine Mayhew very well. The scenery and atmosphere come across well, and the screenplay is remarkably (and refreshingly) faithful to the book, perhaps because it was also written by David Nicholls. The locations are often sumptuous (Edinburgh, Paris, London) and the extras (deleted scenes, interviews, commentary) are also well worth watching. A very watchable movie of a marvellous novel.",1375228800,,1376,5.429906542056075

Some comments talk about not feeling the chemistry, or that you don't know what has happened each year following the day they met, I think that is one of the best advantages of the movie is it really pushes you to use your imagination. Even if you have no imagination it hits on the highlights or their lives, marriage, death, jobs, relationships, good times, and hard times. If Emma and Dex started dating after they met, the relationship would have failed fast.

I have also read the book prior to seeing the movie, the guy who wrote the book also wrote the screenplay, it's a faithful adaptation...stays true to the deep and chaotic friendship/relationship between Dex and Emma. I thought Hathaway was an excellent choice to play Emma, she really brings out Emma's sarcastic, slightly insecure nature while Sturgess brings out Dex's womanizing and yet kind-hearted playful banter. Dex is not very likable in the beginning but you really feel towards the middle of the film, he's a good guy...he's just a little misguided. Parts of the film felt rushed to me, whereas the book gives a lot more space and we get to see Dex and Emma's deep love for each other. Beautiful film if you enjoy romantic dramas (like I do), give it a try!",1359849600,,842,4.695945945945946
4527400,4,B00527QYOW,"Much has been said about Anne Hathaway's accent or lack of it.  Just ignore it and enjoy the story.  Anne and Jim Sturgess are perfectly cast as our two protagonists.  But it is Jim Sturgess who brings just the right depth of emotionality to the role of Dexter that we, the viewer still like and root for him even when he is at his worst.  Sturgess shows us how Dexter hides his feelings for Emma both from her and himself but doesn't do it in an obvious way. Anne is the ideal Emma; she hides her disappointments with Dexter and doesn't play her as the poor helpless heroine.  Throughout the film Sturgess gives us small glimpses into why he and Emma still have an unbreakable bond. As the film progresses we see that Emma is Dexter's anchor and we wonder why Dexter doesn't see it.
One of the major drawbacks of the film is that Nicholls wrote the screenplay from his own novel.  Nicholls tries to crowd as many years as possible within the time allotted to the film. One could focus on the technical aspects such as the pace of directing, the costumes, etc but ultimately it comes back to the script. The writer has to decide which elements of the novel to emphasize and which elements to chuck out.  Some years could have been either eliminated or condensed and some years should have been expanded. Unfortunately the viewer gets tired of seeing the calendar turn over. When Emma and Dexter meet in Paris there is not enough of the interaction between the two of them which explains why Emma makes the decision she does. The film has to be viewed as Dexter's story as he is the one who undergoes more changes in his character.  Although both characters have their highs and lows it is Dexter who falls the farthest but Emma rescues him. The film ends in the same way as the novel and in some ways it's a little ambiguous.
The rest of the cast is superb, especially Romola Garai who doesn't reduce Sylvie to a caricature of a humourless human being.  Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's mother is ideal. Although we would like to have had seen more of Clarkson and Ken Stott as Dexter's parents, but they don't appear too often in the novel.
One Day is not the traditional romance or romantic comedy; and the film should be enjoyed on its own terms. It succeeds on the level for which it was written.",1358899200,2,2297,4.463007159904534

Her character was very likeable, and I pretty much figured out what would happen. But that is okay with me. I did not expect it to be a blockbuster.

4527437,3,B00527QYOW,"Denmark-born director Lone Scherfig's follow-up to her critically acclaimed 2009 film ""An Education"" starring Carey Mulligan is not your typical romantic tale, for better or worse. By saying ""not typical,"" I mean the way the love story is told, not the story itself.

In One day"" the bitter-sweet story of romance between Dexter (Jim Sturgess) and Emma (Anne Hathaway with a Yorkshire accent) that spans more than twenty years is delivered in an unconventional fashion - most events take place on July 15th, from 1988 to 2011 - but once the narrative device is stripped away, the film starts to look more like a beautifully-shot soap opera that goes on and on.

Based on a David Nicholls novel, ""One Day"" follows the story of Dexter and Emma spending the night together after their graduation from Edinburgh University. While Dexter goes on to become a successful (and notorious) TV show presenter, Emma, who really wants to be a writer, starts working as a schoolteacher. Their paths may diverge, but they are always united, keeping in touch with each other. Not a bad story.

I was not disappointed with the storyline itself because I was anticipating a rather downbeat conclusion. What really annoyed me is the film's unconventional way of relating the story, which prevents convincing character developments. By sticking to the ""One Day"" format, the director fails to explain why Emma and Dexter, both of whom are seen dating with another boy/girlfriend, cannot live together from the beginning.

While ""One Day"" makes a good point about time that goes on regardless of our life, its ""romance"" looks often very artificial, devoid of emotion. Time may fly, but not in this way.",1342483200,,1680,4.989285714285714
4527438,3,B00527QYOW,"Fair warning, if you're having a bad day and you're just raring to settle down to a life-affirming romantic movie, for gosh's sake, don't pop this DVD in the player. Me, I haven't read the book this movie is based on, and so I did not see THAT coming.

Sometimes, or even most times, you can't help with whom you fall in love, and apparently this also applies to British folks. Sometimes you start out as friends, perhaps because you're too timid to act upon your attraction. Sometimes, other things get in the way. ONE DAY presents a nifty gimmick. Over the course of two decades, the film tracks the same day - July 15th - in the lives of best friends Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess). On July 15, 1988, they graduate from the University of Edinburgh and meet for the first time and spend the night together just hanging out. Coincidentally, July 15th happens to be St. Swithin's Day, and I guess if you work at it hard enough, you can make certain connections between that tradition and what happens in this film.

Em and Dexter are sort of polar opposites. Em, a blue-collar sort, makes do by dint of hard work and perseverance. Dex, spoiled and irresponsible and a charmer, hails from class and privelege. Em is an aspiring poet who's put her dreams on hold. Straight off university, we see her toiling away in a Tex-Mex restaurant in London even as Dex gallivants around the world chasing wine, women, and song and such. Still, Em and Dex check in on each other.

Let's not mince words. Dexter is an asshat. Except that good fortune keeps smiling on Dex. Seemingly without putting the effort in, he gets a foothold in the entertainment industry, starting out as a television producer and parleying that into hosting his own late-night television show. It dawned on me that there's a parallel here to the fable of the Tortoise and the Hare. Dex's meteoric rise as a television personality is offset by his apocalyptic fall. It's particularly painful watching him on his show interviewing a crew of hip hop artists and catching a case of trying too hard. There's only one Ryan Seacrest - the Devil will honor no further deals. As for Dexter, his candle burnt out too soon. Not that I felt awful for him. To reiterate, dude's an asshat, possibly a wanker.

Meanwhile, Em's prospects have steadily expanded. As Dex's star plummets, Em's rises and she begins living out her dreams. She becomes a thriving author of children's books. What we understand all along is that Em thru the years, during their periods of being close and being estranged, has been the rudder in Dexter's scattershot life. That's how the movie makes sense. I liked the plot device which had the narrative skipping ahead (sometimes for years) and catching us up with the characters always on July 15th. I liked that there's always something changed, that there's been progression. On one hand, you can't overlook the contrived feel of the plot device. On the other hand, it sweeps away all kinds of plot-related detritus. Each July 15th focuses on some relevant high or low point our leads are going thru. I did think that for most of the film, the story itself comes off predictable, the flirting, the wariness, the spats. That is, up until the shocking twist.

If nothing else, I now know how to play the startlingly violent parlor game of ""Are You There, Moriarty?"" Not being a Brit, I couldn't tell if Anne Hathaway's English accent convinces. It sounded good to me, but then, when I was a kid, I thought all Brits talked like D!ck Van Dyke's chimney sweep from MARY POPPINS. But I thought Hathaway was marvelous. And if you gauge Sturgess' effectiveness by how much his character is disliked here, then he also submits a fine performance, because I was seriously hating on Dexter. Grudgingly, I admit that Sturgess does exude raffish charm. I thought ONE DAY had potential. I enjoyed the banter between Hathaway and Sturgess. I became invested in their will they, won't they relationship, even though Dex is so hard to root for. But the third act effed me up, truly it did. Again, if you're looking for a dramatic love story to uplift you, stay far away from this one. ONE DAY is about as feel-good as a three-story face plant onto concrete.",1342137600,,4233,4.668900804289544

4527451,3,B00527QYOW,"Well, this film is portraying a tragic love story that is frankly boring at some parts and quite depressive. You should know how this film is gonna end whenever anyone says it's ""depressing"". Basically, it's about two young souls meeting each other over the course of 20 years before finally realizing they *belong* to each other. Oops, sorry what I meant to say is that they *know* they belong to each other but for some stupid reasons like family, background, career and well substance abuse as well as separate pathways in life they never fully do so and waste a lot of time and when they actually do it's too late.

If there was one moral to this story I would say that, if you found someone who you think is perfect for you, someone who you think understands you better than anyone else, someone you can talk to whenever you're feeling blue or suffering from problems, someone whom you have strong emotions for that can make you go crazy or wild or whatever and they feel the same way about you. If you truly love them, you've been with a lot of people but no one made you feel the same way and if they've been in relationships and still think you're the one for them, If the feeling is mutual and the obstacles that are getting in your way of being together are *not* that ultimate. Then why wait? Why go back and forth? why waste time? You never know when are you going to die or when are they going to die. So, wouldn't you want to spend time with them while you still can? Evey day is a blessing and it can also be the last day for you. Life is just too short to beat around the bushes especially in love, so if you made the mistake of letting this person go and your feelings for them and their feelings for you haven't changed there's no reason to hold back.

Well, other than that the acting was good. The movie reminded me of Atonement except it was a lesser version in my opinion. If you don't like sad/too realistic for life romances then this movie is not for you. If you're a fan of the happily ever after idea then just skip this. However, this movie portrays a mistake I'm sure some of us have done in life you know when you had that perfect partner next to you and you just made them go and now you're thinking what the hell was I thinking?",1339632000,,2260,4.253488372093023

4527480,3,B00527QYOW,"Promoted as a romantic comedy, there's little humor in this attempt at adding a twist to the age old story of two people ""meant for each other."" The film opens in current time showing a young woman on a bicycle navigating through traffic but quickly cuts back to 1988.  Dex (Jim Sturgess) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) are college classmates in England who barely know each other but go drinking the night of their graduation.  Em is a bit dorky with her giant horn-rimmed glasses and equally giant underwear.  Dex is a campus stud who is still interested.  Both have been drinking.  Their attempt at copulation is unfulfilled for a variety of reasons, but mostly Emma's shyness and uncertainty.  Eventually they agree to cuddle but no sex and remain friends.

Each year they get together on July 15, so the film takes us to each of those year where we get to experience their current life's situation.  Dex becomes a TV host of a dance club show and cavorts with numerous bimbos.  Emma's career of writing never takes off so she is stuck at a Mexican restaurant for years before becoming a teacher.  At some point, Dex becomes less attractive and relies on booze to get him through.  Emma of course becomes quite the looker.

Most audiences will know where this movie is going before even turning on the TV.  None of this is new.  Frankly it's just aggravating.  Eventually what we know will happen does, but when we check the DVD player's clock and remember that opening sequence we know that the show isn't over.  Hathaway always gives a fine performance and does so here.  Sturgess is excellent as well, but this move is so maudlin and predictable I just wanted to get on with it and cut out about 5 of those yearly reunions.

The Blu ray version of this film looks very good.  Transferred in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film contrast and black levels are excellent.  No complaints.  The audio is in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Surround activity is pretty good but rare.  Expect some action coming from crowd scenes, restaurants and bars.  Dialog is clear and concise.

Firstly, I have not read the book, will not read the book, and firmly believe that a book and a film can not be compared, as they are two copmpletely different mediums. The only exception is if there are absolutely major changes to the characters or the story. So, having said that, the film is great. The concept of having the story take place on only one day in a year is very clever, therfore, keeping you fully intrigued in the characters and the journey of their relationship. The two main actors do a great job. Jim Sturgess does come across as slightly annoying, but criticism of Anne Hathaway's accent are slightly unfair. The story is beatutiful and real, and definately worth watching.

4527495,3,B00527QYOW,"Confession: in preparation for this preview, my wife instructed me to read David Nicholls' runaway best seller One Day, on which this film is based. I got no more than a couple of pages in before flinging the book aside in horror and exasperation. Not my kind of book. Its core constituency is thirty and forty-something women (a more elegant phrase my wife objects to is ""women in their middle years""), an electorate with whom I have a great deal of familiarity but of which I have no real comprehension.

This puts me at two disavantages: one, not having read the book, I'm not able to judge the independent quality of the film against it (though the screenplay is written by the author); and two, it's hardly likely to be my sort of film anyway.

And nor is it.

One Day is a sort of updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary/dp/B0006TL9RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>. Emma Morely (an accent-mangling Anne Hathaway) is a frumpy, working class, right-on, bespectacled poet who, in the dying moments of a university capping booze-up stumbles into Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess). He's a handsome, posh, bounder. Other than passing out of tertiary education and into the big wide world concurrently they have nothing in common but still contrive to spend a cramped single evening on a cramped single bed: a brief relationship which against her better judgment - and his baser intentions - they do not consummate. They do, somehow, manage to plant seeds of a different sort, and a mystical bond of friendship forms, which we trace through the subsequent trajectories of their lives.

The device Nicholls employs to achieve this is revisiting them on the anniversary of their meeting, St. Swithin's Day, in each year for the next twenty or so. It is a neat contrivance which presents its own narrative challenges, and Nicholls' screenplay deals with them well, although as an aside, it does miss a fairly obvious beat: conventional wisdom has it that on ""St Swithin's Day if thou dost rain, for forty days it will remain"", so there's an element of metaphorical permanence attaching to this day - a bright red cue, you would think, for Nicholls to have it rain. Except that he doesn't. And, when Dex recounts this rhyme, he caddishly fudges it and says ""St Swithin's day blah blah blah rain, blah blah blah remain"". What Nicholls thought he was doing with this particular piece of screenwriting I have no idea. But it points up his laziness surprisingly.

Nontheless the mystical permanence is established, and Emma and Dexter set off on 20 year-long character arcs. As convention requires, they are precise inversions of each other: Emma struggles nobly as the shift manager of a crappy Mexican restaurant and writes unpublished poetry in a grimy flat while Dex lands a job as a presenter of a vacuous but glamorous late night TV show and proceeds to embrace a lifetime of cocaine and floozies. Just as you wonder where it all went wrong, Dex falls to Earth, and Emma gets her publishing deal and finally begins to rise above it. Throughout all his peccadilloes and her drudgery, their improbable bond remains - never consummated, but we meander ever more closely to it. As we go, minor characters enrich the story; Patricia Clarkson is particularly good as Dexter's dying mother, and Rafe Spall battles gamely with a poorly written love-interest for Hathaway.

For all that, I had a hard time buying the central relationship. And this film, and the novel, stands or falls on it: it needs the leading characters and their motivations to be credible. For the film to remain engaging, we need to really root for Emma and Dexter: they need, almost, to be heroic lovers overcoming tribulations of an almost Ancient Greek dimension. But Nicholls' screenplay doesn't deliver this, and nor do the actors compensate: Sturgess has some charisma but is no Colin Farrell. His character is for the most part a shallow bounder who does nothing to earn Emma's initial emotional investment, much less her ongoing forbearance. Hathaway's Emma is just a bit wet, even if she has traveled the length and breadth of the Isles to assemble her accent (could they really not find an English actress to play this role?), and was made up so frumpily that, on occasion she resembled Michael Sheen in drag.

Nonetheless Emma and Dexter finally, properly, intersect in a surprisingly clumsy scene in Paris. If you're part of the core constituency and have been properly swept up, Dexter and Emma's act of consummation may thrill you: I'm not; I found it postively icky.

There are some predictable plot twists (the big one was telegraphed a mile off) while other story beats (such as why Emma leaves her French Lover and finally returns to Dexter, having just rejected him) are not expounded at all. This is disconcerting.

As the film limps to its conclusion it remains difficult to see the appeal of this story, no matter how cleverly it may have been told. Dexter isn't charismatic enough or likeable enough to justify Emma's ongoing commitment. Emma isn't interesting or tragic enough for us to feel truly sorry for her.

This isn't a bad film: there are one or two nicely framed shots: Patricia Clarkson leaning into her son's shoulder at an ivy-clad window, particularly, is a resonant image. But it isn't an especially good film, either. For sure, winsome romances aren't my thing, but I can still appreciate a fully character driven film, and this rarely gets above merely workmanlike. Ultimately, there wasn't enough of a connection between the central characters for this film to carry the day.

Fast forward to last night when we finally rented and watched it.  Worst decision ever.  Let's talk about what's good: the movie had great music that represented each year of their story.  I loved the classic 80s, 90s, and today. Took me back.  Now the rest...

There was no chemistry between the actors, no empathy for either of them, the female role for Anne Hathaway was just pathetic (As was the ever-changing British-esque accent), and there was no redemption.  The movie just kept going and going with nothing funny or redeeming.  Skip it. There is nothing cute, nothing romantic, nothing to make you look at the one your with and go ""awww"".

This is not a romantic film that slaps you in the face like many movies do, and I thought it was all the better for that. It wasn't showy or scripted smart (and I love some of those films too), it was real and everyday and rather wonderful. A fixed beat that sounded every year that allowed us a glimpse into two lives - without trying to compress all the story elements in, was very effective and none more so then when the beat was halted albeit temporarily.

I thought the acting was superb, especially Jim Sturgess and Romola Garai. Maybe I am old but it does seem that hindsight is such an impossible gift and that the memories that we fill our lives are so marvellously flawed.",1328659200,4,858,4.162650602409639
4527511,1,B00527QYOW,"I love Anne Hathaway.  She is just so luminescent and just a joy to watch.  She's also one of the more talented young stars who can tackle a wide range of things (she can sing, she can do comedy, she can to drama, she can be sexy) and so I tend to get really excited when I see her name pop up.  When `One Day' came out I remember some of my friends talking about how the novel was really, really good but that it seemed almost unfilmable and so they were nervous about how this was going to pan out.  I have yet to read the novel, and so I didn't have those worries.

I saw `Starring Anne Hathaway' and I was sold.

I love you Anne, but this movie was ill-advised.

The issue with `One Day', an issue that never goes away and permeates every scene, is that it is structuralized in vignettes that span over the course of twenty-some-odd-years but that consist of one day per year and so we rarely get filled in on the events of the year, just the moments of that one particular day (the same day each year, the day that the two main characters originally met).  In literary form, I can see how this could work because there is opportunity to expound, but in an hour and forty minutes it is very hard to convey much of anything.  As a result, the relationship between Emma and Dex takes no shape.  It just doesn't feel real.  The burgeoning love they are supposed to form really doesn't come across at all, so when the film reaches critical moments towards the end it feels rather forced and not truly legitimate.  Another thing is that the context surrounding the importance of that day never really feels necessary either.  I mean, it's not like they do something special with one another on that day every year.  Sometimes they don't even talk to one another, but for some reason things happen on that day every year that we need to see (or so it would seem).

Outside of the botched structure and flakey storytelling, the acting is also a miss of sorts.  Watching Hathaway and Sturgess was a lot like watching the Oscars when Hathaway and Franco co-hosted.  Hathaway tries really hard to pick up all the slack that Sturgess was dropping.  I blame a lot of it on Dex's characterization (he is just a selfish oaf through 90% of the film) but the way that Sturgess plays him is with zero effort or originality.

He's lazy; and don't even get me started on my beloved Patricia Clarkson and the worst performance of her career.

In the end, `One Day' suffers from being an intriguing concept formatted in an unappealing way with a screenplay and is far too fluffy and a host of performances that lack conviction directed by a promising voice (`An Education' was so delightfully inspired) who seems to have caught a spell of laryngitis.",1328486400,5,2733,4.428

I found it especially hard at the end to feel anything but disappointed.  My husband and I both looked at each other, shook our heads and said nearly in unison ""Worst movie, EVER"".

4527516,2,B00527QYOW,"Emma and Dexter graduate from school and then end up at her place for what could've been the beginning of a whirlwind romance or a one-night stand but ends as something of a near-miss with them deciding to remain friends. Emma (played by Anne Hathaway with an absentee accent that comes and goes with no real mention) is an aspiring writer from a humble background. Dexter (played by Jim Sturgess of 21 and Across the Universe) is the son of wealthy parents with whom he has a difficult relationship.

  Through many years we see Dexter (Sturgess) go from a television personality who's despised even by his fans to a man with no career who takes a job at a restaurant in the hopes of moving up the ladder in the organization to make a living for his wife and child. Meanwhile Emma (Hathaway) spends most of that time working in a Mexican restaurant and involved with a man she doesn't love but who loves her dearly. And for a large portion of that time in her life, she and Dexter are not speaking despite being each other's best friends.

  While Sturgess is believable enough as the uber-cad who gets by on charm until that gives way substance abuse and boorishness and Hathaway is fine save for her accent, the story isn't very interesting and the ending left me annoyed and confused and maybe more than a little aggravated.

I love Anne Hathaway, and Jim Sturgess isn't bad to look at sometimes...they are both good actors and had great chemistry on screen. The rest of this review might be kind of a SPOILER, so read with caution. I know a main point to the movie is to see Jim's character, Dex, transform from a carefree, bed-hopping playboy to a tender, caring, more responsible adult deserving of Emma's love...I get that. I just feel like his low points in the story could have been drawn out longer and maybe made more complex. I think the skipping from year to year was all done a little too fast at times to properly display those low moments in his life that were so important for Dex to overcome so he could become who we see at the end of the story. Emma's story was kind of, well, really predictable and cliche, and, I felt bad for her during most of the movie...she seems to just be waiting around for Dex while we see her living her boring life. She seems to have things ""happening"" for her, but, secretly, she's still just waiting around for Dex. Most of the ending was predictable and sad and made me mad, too, because it was so bittersweet. It reminded me of the ending to City of Angels. I was entertained while watching, and I cried a little. It was nice to have a good cry. OK for a rental.

4527518,4,B00527QYOW,"This music soundtrack (Rachel Portman) with so many great songs from 'Elvis Costello', 'Fatboy Slim', and 'Tears For Fears', lends so much to this movie.  They are as diverse as the two lead characters can be. This is directed by Lone Scherfig (An Education), from the novel and screenplay written by David Nicholls, who always adds a great mix of music to her movies.  We meet Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter-""Dex"" (Jim Sturgess) on the night of their graduation from their University in England. This is the night in which this unlikely couple gets together on the 15th of July, 1988.  The time spent is full of awkwardness, so much so it is palpable to the viewer. They are so uncomfortable with each other until the point of resignation to remain platonic, with Dex adding, ""Maybe we could just be friends"".  At the time it is a good idea for the both of them although can it remain this way?  A different sort of romantic film where we watch these two growing up in their adult lives and carving out their places in the world. Riddled with some twists and turns that are unexpected and then finessed makes this not your usual fare.

This 'friendship' will span lofty decades in which the two faithfully get together every ""One Day"" of each and every year.  This day always being July 15th.  The Anniversary of Them ...

Emma being the more scholastic type with a well-rounded disposition, she has a razor sharp wit and is very sweet along with being quite caring. Dex continues being more the extrovert along with his dalliances with women.  Something intangible remains with these two from that night together, each intrigued with the other as he or she head off in separate directions to lead their own lives. This again until they reach July 15th once again.  Dex takes a much more worldly approach to his employment, although briefly takes a position as an English teacher then quickly changes his course to fame.  He becomes a mildly popular host of a dance-type program and also a personality of note on television, to the disapproval of his parents (mainly his father).  His mother, portrayed by the always wonderful Patricia Clarkson, is more understanding of her son although shares a much shorter screen time.

Emma and Dex go forward with their lives separately now after being together on the same July day as the year before. Dex is building his popularity and womanizing and Emma is working in a dead-end job in a Tex-Mex restaurant.  This is where she meets her sort of boyfriend, Ian Whitehead (Rafe Spall). They eventually move into a flat together and she finally finishes some schooling and becomes a teacher herself.  Dex is getting into all kinds of trouble and meeting with Emma to discuss issues at hand or to just be together annually.  Through thick and thin these two carve out their lives during many years of pitfalls and meetings with each other ... in London, in Paris, they never lose track of the other.  The timing never seems right for the pair to be together although the subject flirts with them every year, the 'what ifs' or 'the maybes'. They help each other as much as hurt themselves by hiding their obvious love for one another.  Twenty years is so long to be holding onto what could have been.  When the time is right and Dex is at his wits end with his life in disarray he goes to Paris on the fateful July day.  Emma is with her new and exciting boyfriend, a Frenchman, and has to decide if her love for Dex is a sure thing.  Could their love be that one special love of a lifetime?  Should they take that gamble?

It is at about this point that the movie takes a massive shift in the plot and I never expected this twist but surprisingly it did not anger me but had me questioning; I was completely bewildered.

This movie has been classed in the Romantic Comedy genre, although I maybe snickered a couple of times because of Emma's quick razor-sharp retorts and a sharp wit she does have a large store of.  I would definitely say this is a drama containing lots of romantic leanings, loving gestures, and a total sweeping of 'opposites attract' that carries this couple along through the years.

4527543,2,B00527QYOW,"This is one of those films that should be studied in film class because it speaks to what is so difficult about making quality movies.  If you examine each of the components - the actors, the script, the locations, the cinematography, and the plot....well, not the plot.  And certainly not the direction or editing.  But if you look at each of those first four things I mentioned, they were good enough.

But somewhere along the line, probably having to do with weak direction and editing, and perhaps a plot that has already been done several times (boy meets girl now and then over long period of time, and even though they are hot for each other they never get together until the end) ""One Day"" ended up completely lacking any real emotion, depth, or integrity.  I'm told its brought in $56 million world wide, which is a credit to the drawing power of the two young leads, I suppose.

SPOILER ALERT: (If my review so far hasn't already spoiled this flick for you.) I realize that part of the plot was the transformation of the male lead from a person that basically has no character or integrity into a person who ...well, we don't really ever find out.  At the end we learn that the feels bad about losing the love of his life.  And he likes to take walks with his daughter.

Perhaps its my lack of British sensibility.  The British love ""cheeky"" dialogue, fancy cars, angst-ridden, pathetic, wealthy male leads (see most of Hugh Grant's career), and my daughters tell me Jim Sturgess is attractive.  But he lacked all sense of value.  And even this would have been OK if that fact had been developed.  But basically the Sturgess character is unrelatable, goes nowhere, and that's not a good thing for one of the two leads in a movie.

God, the worst moment in the movie had to be about 85% of the way through when Anne Hathaway gets on the bike in traffic.  At this point, my family had a pretty good sense of the lack of creativity in the plot/direction, so as the same motor cycle kept racing by her several times, from a variety of camera angles (no, not for effect, I assume just terrible editing), I turn to my wife and say, ""Oh no.  They are going to kill her off in an accident.""  She says, ""That wouldn't make sense, but I share your concern.""

Literally 30 seconds, one turn, and one alley later (and the motor cycle is long gone), Anne Hathaway gets flattened by a medium sized, very fast moving truck.  I don't mean she got hit.  She got destroyed!  I haven't seen a collision this brutal (in a non-action flick) since Brad Pitt got nailed after the coffee shop scene in ""Meet Joe Black.""  It was cheap, completely telegraphed, inappropriate, and terribly done.  Whatever shred of cred was left before that scene, was long gone.

Hathaway the actress is very good at developing endearing personalities on screen.  She comes off as a young woman any young man would love to date.  But for some reason, she ends up with a guy who ""...sits around playing games and farting in the apartment...""  The scenes in the Mexican restaurant were cute, but right out of ""Princess Diaries.""  So as in real life, Anne Hathaway falls for the wrong man, and we have to watch her suffer for it for well over an hour, until it appears that he may have changed into a great guy. But ""bloody heck,"" that lorry takes her out before their new relationship can develop.

Wow, this film was terrible!  Even my wife and daughters were heckling the television (about twenty minutes after I started) at the end.

Two stars - one for Anne Hathaway's huge eyes, and one for the actress who had a minor role playing Sturgess's mother, dying from cancer, who even in her tiny role, stood out as the best of the cast.",1326067200,27,3701,4.495508982035928

4527549,3,B00527QYOW,"I wanted to be a believer. I wanted to believe that obviously gorgeous Emma (Anne Hathaway) was an ugly duckling so insecure she'd be pitifully infatuated with smug, smirking playboy Dex. And that in spite of his Cad behavior, which is telegraphed, semaphored, and all but ridden in by Pony Express and flown by Goodyear Blimp throughout two-thirds of the movie, he is really a sweet guy underneath. And actually I could sort of believe it, because there can be a genuine good girl/bad boy dynamic in real life. These opposite types can be attracted to each other.

The problem is that it takes Emma and Dex so looo-ooo-ooong to overcome their individual weaknesses. Would somebody as bright as Emma really stay at her sombrero-wearing gig at a taco joint for years? Even after Emma finally gets a good haircut and a good job, she lives with pathetic wannabe-comedian boyfriend Ian seemingly FOREVER after she knows she'll never love him. Dex remains a womanizer and a selfish drunk into his thirties. The scene where he's chosen as ""The Most Obnoxious Man On Television"" is sort of winning, but how long do we want to follow the career of a man like this? The slackest scenes in the movie are the endless ones which show Dex as drunk, greasy and dishevelled.

Hathaway and Sturgess's acting skills save the movie. (By the way, Hathaway's English accent is perfectly O.K.) Inspite of ourselves, we get drawn into their individual metamorphoses--and yes, the chemistry between them is there. We can even believe that, at long last, Dex has grown into the man and father he was meant to be. And then there is the ending.

SPOILER ALERT.  The tragic ending seems, to me, completely gratuitous. The movie has (for the most part) a romantic-comedy structure, and it's more thoughtful than most. We've been led to care about these characters and to cheer when they finally achieve what they always should have had--a life together. A totally unheralded death which lays waste to everything they hoped for and finally reached comes as a meaninglessly cruel slap in the face.

And yet, I felt like I missed something important that must have happened during the intervening 364 days.

I don't think it's ""European"" or a complete bore  -- it's a love story.  A love story with a unique twist at that, thanks to the one-day-per-year approach.  It's not a romantic comedy, but it's not all doom and gloom either.  And comparing it to Friends with Benefits?  Really?  That's like comparing a dirty, crumpled paper plate with food stains (Friends with Benefits..quite possibly the worst movie ever) to fine porcelain (One Day).  Just because Friends with Benefits takes place in America and was probably written by an American, doesn't mean it's representive of what American relationships are like...It's exaggerated cheap comedy.  If you going to base things off movies, then you might as well assume all Americans have lives like The Notebook instead.

I'll be honest.  I don't like Anne Hathaway.  I especially disliked her as Jane Austen and I was dreading the reemergence of her British accent.  And for the first few minutes of the film, it does grate on your nerves.  But she's really likable as Emma.

One reviewer said someone who watched this without reading the book might not understand the story.  And, really, although I'm sure the book is great and has a whole bunch more detail -- this isn't exactly mystery and unending complexities.

The film isn't slow (it moves a year at a time!), but it's about watching two people grow up so there's not going to be any sudden chase scenes and whatnot.

4527579,1,B00527QYOW,"One Day is probably the worst movie I have seen in many years.  I expected so much more from Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgiss.  These cannot be the same actors who played so well in Love and Other Drugs and The Way Back.

The primary plot line of the story is an on-going friendship/love between two people who exhibit the worst qualities of Generation X.  As ""star crossed"" lovers travel from one empty experience (romance, relationships, jobs) to another, only finding solace in each other's company.  They are meant to be together and yet, something always pulls them apart.  Usually something self-destructive and/or petty.  The young woman finally finds herself as an author and the young man finally crawls down from his narcissist perch to find what they have always needed - each other. So basically I could have written this review without seeing the film.

And what's with Anne Hathaway's pool scenes?  I don't get the significance of swimming laps...  Unless of course the director is trying to illustrate the tedium of the heroine's life.  Not that he needed any, the movie was tedious enough without the laps.

The requisite tragedy is not a surprise because two people so pathetic could never be happy for very long.  But it's useful because the hero, as pathetic as he is can go deeper, becoming even more pitiful if that's possible. And even in the end, as our hero has his cathartic moment - his own daughter reminds him of the pathetic loser that he is.  As the credits roll we see the hero, smiling gently, knowing that here, in this place, being insulted by his daughter, his ex-wife and the rest of his inner circle, he has found peace. And I went to find a bag to barf in...

Basically the whole movie is a huge contest about which one of the main characters is the most pathetic.  Spoiler alert, he wins but only because he's the last one standing.

What a waste of time.  I cannot recommend this DVD - wait until it comes out on cable and find something better to do - like wash the car, clean the bathroom, get that root canal done. Anything not to waste another two hours that you cannot get back.",1324339200,14,2121,4.5661375661375665

4527592,4,B00527QYOW,"ONE DAY is a gentle surprise of a film.  Though the premise of a 20 year friendship turning into love is not a new one, the finesse the two main actors bring to this story makes it work like a fresh peach.  Based on a novel by David Nicholls (who also write the screenplay) and directed with a fine sense of momentum by Lone Schering, this is a little romance with several rhapsodic and clever twists that tosses in a bit of historical interest just to keep things rolling.

In a British weather lore proverb it is stated that if it rains on St. Swithin's  day July 15th there will be rain for 40 days. In ONE DAY (we visit St. Swithin's day for 20 years) Dexter (Jim Sturgess) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) formally meet on July 15, 1986 as they graduate from college: each has big dreams for the future, and quite by accident they spend the night together - in a rather platonic way.  They part ways as friends and as the years go by they both find themselves in jobs not quite up to their dreams: Emma waitresses at a TexMex grill while Dexter ends up in a tacky position as a front man for a low class television show.  Dexter is a ladies man and has multiple partners while Emma is more reserved and only attaches to one - Ian (Rafe Spall) - who is a boring standup comedian, but is available.  Dexter's girls tend toward the glamorous, including Suki (Georgia King) and Sylvie (Romola Garai) with whom he has a child, only to discover that Sylvie's taste in romance matches Dexter's Lothario role.  Every year on July 15th Emma and Dexter meet, finally realizing that they are in love.  Circumstances intervene to this perfect love story and the ending is unexpectedly touching.

There are some fine cameo roles in the film, especially Patricia Clarkson and Ken Stott as Dexter's parents.  One fascinating aspect of the film is watching the styles in hair and clothes change over the 20 years as well as the introduction of all the accoutrements of today. Times have changed as much as Emma and Dexter have changed, and that makes the film work even better.  Hathaway and Sturgess are superb, creating tow credible characters about whom we can care.

As the years pass, the pair naturally come to realize they may have been perfect for each other all along.

4527631,4,B00527QYOW,"Maybe if I had read the book this movie is based on, the movie would not have lived up to it. As it is I experienced the story's poignant insights solely through this movie and they resonate strongly with me. A central message in this movie is that what makes us fall in love with someone doesn't always have to do with what we admire about them. We fall in love with who we are the most equal to.

  On the surface, Anne and Jim's characters are opposites but if you think about it they are really more alike than not. One giveaway of this is that Dexter's mother points out how she hates his hosting voice and later Emma recommends against him using that voice on his show.  It's a subtle way of showing that Emma may be different from him on the surface, but underneath she's like Dexter's mother, who he connects with very naturally.  Many of the ""differences"" about the two people are due to the fact that Dexter is screwed up. But she sees him for what he can be at his best. This kind of instictive, honest love doesn't enflate our ego, but remains even when we're at our worst (""I love you, I just don't LIKE you anymore""), giving us the opportunity to be something worthwhile. The other differences are less like differences and more like compliments (She's smart and responsible and he's spontaneous and draws her out).

  The choices the two characters make, especially Dexter's, give the movie the suspense it needs. I'm normally lukewarm towards Anne Hathaway but I really thought she fit this part well. She had amazing chemistry with Jim Sturgess and her uncanny ability to look nerdy and childish from one angle and elegant and vulnerable from another worked well for the character. Without giving the ending away, I felt like the screenwriters gave us enough movie after the ""major plot twist"" to deal with the emotions it caused.

For  myself... this movie is an absolute waste of my time!!! I would not recommend it  to anyone who has any sort of moral fiber...,1322956800,,264,4.117647058823529
4527635,1,B00527QYOW,"2 hours of my life I won't get back, the film follows the tragic friendship-but-never-quite-relationship of Emma and Dex bouncing from the 1980's up to present day in 1-5 year steps.  The film just drags on and on with few light spots, only to end in tragedy.  What a waste of time!  Don't watch if you're hoping for a pick-me-up!",1322870400,5,330,4.466666666666667
4527636,3,B00527QYOW,"I would have given this movie 2 stars if not for the wonderful images and costumes. Following two people's lives over 23 years it's an ambitious project ... it takes an exceptional plot line, screenplay, director, and cast to keep the viewers interested in the subject (i.e., 84 Charing Cross Road). Although there are some very good moments, overall the movie is boring and superficial in presenting the main characters' lives, feelings, and reactions to events. Patricia Clarkson was my favorite, albeit in a very small role.",1322870400,,527,5.068965517241379
4527637,4,B00527QYOW,Worth watching. Well acted. There were funny moments. Quite sad at the end. It was very touching. I really enjoyed it.,1322784000,2,118,4.666666666666667
4527638,1,B00527QYOW,"I rented this movie for my wife and myself because I saw romantic comedy. It should have been categorized as romantic depressive. I realize the previous reviewers love this movie based upon prior knowledge of the book etc. The movie matches their description. All that I am saying is that it is not a romantic comedy, so if that is what you are looking for, then don't bother with this movie.",1322784000,15,392,4.535211267605634
4527639,4,B00527QYOW,"Playing Emma Morley in One Day, Anne Hathaway simply outshines and she does this thing where she leaves me completely bemused talking to the walls asking if they saw what I saw. I don't know if I should credit the film or Anne Hathaway alone, she is an absolute delight to watch act. One Day somehow gave me exactly what I thought it would. Jim Sturgess is an ok actor. The direction is self satisfied and doesn't try to be as ambitious as the storyline is - which to me is an ideal mix.",1322092800,4,487,4.191489361702128

Very sad in that they spent their youth running away from each other..Dexter in particular.. instead of embracing true love.  Time waits for no one and taking those loved for granted is sad but human.  I liked the movie.  A lot of reality in the storyline.",1525132800,,385,4.787878787878788
