8249787,5,B0013CT9RY,"I had the privilege to experience Billy Gibsons' gifted performance on the 2008 Blues Cruise during the Harmonica Blow-out.  Prior to that I had not been familiar with his talent.  I remember after his intro he verbalized feeling honored to be on the stage with such legendary greats, then he let loose on his harmonica and blew my mind.  It was his performance I remembered years later.  It was his performance that would spontaneously come back in flashbacks of memory driving me to research and find out what he's got out there.

Billy has the ability to hit notes that are like the riffs of a lead guitar, also like throaty, soulful vocals, and traditional blues that just pulls you in. His performance is gifted, his exuberance engaging, and his connection with the audience and his band members warm and genuine.  Billy comes across as someone who not only loves what he does but also loves everyone around him.

Prior to watching this video I was just someone who had experienced Billy Gibsons' gift and was touched by it.  Now, I am a fan and even more in awe of his talent.

The performance on the video is amazing!  The last number is over the top, and I couldn't help but wonder how does he manage to breathe and still have all that air available to breathe life into those notes.

The only negative for me was either some of the video recording or editing work.  At times during the video there are shots that pan in and out quickly and mimic a slow strobe.  But, considering the quality of the performance and the infrequency of the 'special effect', it is insignificant and does not detract from the experience.  I assumed the technique was intended to ""jazz-up"" the video and add something extra.  In my opinion his performance doesn't need any embellishment, just record him doing what he does, and that will always be more than enough.

If you are into Blues harmonica, or Blues period, you owe it to yourself to check out Billy Gibson.

Caution:  watching this video will trigger a hunger for more Billy Gibson.",1380585600,,2029,4.620111731843576
8249788,5,B0013CT9RY,The last track on this live performance is unbelievable!  I wish there was more available showcasing Billy's blues harp.  An interesting man with an extraordinary talent; and an outstanding deal through Amazon.,1289001600,,210,5.53125
8249789,4,B0013CT9RY,"Wow! I have heard two previous Billy Gibon productiobns - two CDs: ""In a Memphis Tone"" and ""The Nearness of You"". They are pure jazz. Mellow, romantic,luxury night club kind of jazz. Superb! But on the DVD, one can watch completly different side of Billy! Pure bluesman. Modern, full of energy, playing raw, distorted harmonica with the backing of great, modern section! And I love both sides of Billy! And don't think I am somehow connected with Billy! No, no! I live in Poland and I have never met this great artist. However, I would love to - no matter what face ""bluesy"" or ""jazzy"" he is going to show!
