8569854,5,B00BK6HQR8,"The kind of ""easy listening classical""  music to be enjoyed any time .... plus a nice remembrance of a great conductor",1417132800,,118,4.619047619047619
8569855,5,B00BK6HQR8,Solti has always been a favourite conductor with his insight and inspiring leadership. The comments by his widow are very interesting.,1376524800,,134,5.428571428571429
8569856,3,B00BK6HQR8,"If you were there this is a great buy. If you were not it would be a great rent. Everything is beautifully done but only the Bartok is a complete piece and interesting and heartfelt as the commentary by Lady Solti is, it is not something one wants to hear again and again. This is not a disc one would be likely to play very often for just that reason so unless it is very cheap or you really want a superb performance of the Bartok then I suggest rent, and rent you should as it is a great evening.",1367971200,6,499,4.0
