Highly recommend!

3515768,5,B001CQONQ8,"I am a San Francisco, Karl Malden, Michael Douglas fan and I watched these at home when they first aired back in the early seventies. I appear in one of the episodes for about three seconds in a crowd scene so I am personally attached. That one has not been released yet so I am waiting for it. I just got lucky the first day I ever set foot in San Francisco. Amazing.

Yes, some of the stories and some of the the lighting are a bit, ""early seventies"" but I want to have every one of these. And if you like old cars, every car on the street is a classic. I love seeing (and mapping) the San Francisco scenes. I hope that of all the remaing seasons are released soon. Keep 'em coming Amazon!",1227916800,4,691,4.080882352941177
3515769,5,B001CQONQ8,"During the second act of the first episode it happens...that 2-minute or more long tracking shot of the partners striding through headquarters shot from the waist up with no cuts, both men acting with their posture, their arms, their stride, their faces, their voices--the whole thing.  It's my favorite thing about this old show.  There are enough interesting angles and shots to make the direction interesting much of the time, and then there's a scene like this in almost every episode where the actors spout a few pages of dialog and just act for all they are worth with no close-ups or pauses or quick cuts.  It's such a refreshing change from modern shows.  San Francisco is a glorious backdrop, and Malden and Douglas are great together.  The stories are 50 minutes long and develop slowly.  What wonderful change of pace!

Here are the episodes with a few guest stars and directors noted:
The Runaways--3 kids trying to stay together (Larry Wilcox, Jeanette Nolan)
Winterkill--bombs and blackmail
Most Feared in the Jungle--woman doesn't believe baby was stillborn
Commitment--Stone's daughter visits, always a good ep (Tyne Daly)
Chapel of the Damned--kidnapping and psychics
Blockade--rape and murder (Cheryl Ladd, Ida Lupino, Charles Martin Smith)
Crossfire--a sniper (Nick Nolte)
A String of Puppets--Steve goes undercover (dir by Richard Donner)
Inferno--arson, of course!
The Hard Breed--rodeo murder (Harry Carey, Jr.)
Rampage--vigilantes, always a 70s favorite! (Ron Glass)
Death and the Favored Few--blackmail",1226707200,23,1526,5.38655462184874
3515770,5,B001CQONQ8,I like this show alot and I never tire of watching it. Karl Malden and Michael Douglas were a great team on this show like Don Johnson and Cheech Marin were on Nash Bridges but I personally think The Streets Of San Francisco is way better than Nash Bridges. How often do you hear comments like Buddy boy and Hotshot on cop shows these days not too mention see the father/son like chemistry Karl Malden and Michael Douglas had? Not very often or not at all. I can't wait to get Volumne 2 of Season 2 in a couple weeks and get the remaining seasons. This show and EMERGENCY! are #1 in my book and I never tire of watching them.,1224979200,9,625,4.1735537190082646
3515771,4,B001CQONQ8,"The Streets of San Francisco is part of the legacy of Quinn Martin, who was one of television's alltime most successful producers, responsible for some of television's most popular action/adventure series. Martin was the producer for such popular series as The Untouchables, The FBI, Cannon, and Barnaby Jones.

The Streets of San Francisco followed the pattern of most of Martin's shows. There were divided into three acts and an epilogue, and the guest stars were introduced at the beginning of each episode. The show feature veteran, Oscar-winning actor Karl Malden (who during this time starred in a series of popular commercials for American Express credit cards) and Michael Douglas, son of Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas.

Malden played veteran SF homicide cop Mike Stone, who was newly paired with rookie detective Steven Keller, played by Douglas. Following the Naked City model of police dramas, Stone showed the green Keller the ropes of policing the city while Keller used his criminology decree and understanding of modern technology to balance the equation. Darleen Carr has an occasional role as Stone daughter and Keller's eventual love interest.

This was a solid, enjoyable series and the teaming of Malden and Douglas was an excellent one. This show is one that is still entertaining almost forty years later.",1217376000,12,1327,5.25

3515787,5,B001CQONQ8,"Yeah, but the packaging on this sucks. All of the cases in the series has been fine until this joke box. The single disc case is fine. The double one is a nightmare. Open it over a table with a pillow underneath it or sit down and open it in your lap and the discs will just fall out. The spindle in this case are broken off. I wanted Amazon to send me a case, but had to go through all the trouble of on line business, printing out return label, repacking it and then walking to UPS. They sent me another one just like the first !!!  It is clearly a faulty case and I noticed that other customers have posted this warning as far back as a few years ago and evidently there has not been a change. BIG BUMMER. However, Great Series.",1449964800,,731,4.041379310344827
3515788,5,B001CQONQ8,Hooked until this day.  It's so much more enjoyable when you can watch a show straight through.  Michael Douglas was excellent in this series.  I don't know of any actor who could play the Lt. Mike Stone then Karl Malden.,1444089600,,221,4.475

3515791,5,B001CQONQ8,"For four seasons in the 1970s, Karl Malden and Michael Douglas played a detective team in the ABC police drama ""The Streets of San Francisco.""  The superb series found a loyal following and ended up ranked as a Top 30 show by its second season, and this DVD set contains the final twelve episodes of Season Two that were originally broadcast from December 1973 to March 1974.

Mike Stone (Malden) and Steve Keller (Douglas) solved crimes involving murder, kidnapping, robbery, blackmail, a bomb threat, a sniper, arson, and vigilantes in these episodes which also saw Stone face being framed and Keller go undercover.  Lola Falana guest starred in one episode and famed sports announcer Keith Jackson cameoed in another.

The series was filmed on location and incorporated the great scenery of the Bay Area as well as scenes from all over San Francisco, from the urbane to the gritty and everything in between.  The viewer gets to see period cars, hospitals, city government buildings, clothes, diners, telephones, radios, bars, a fire station, and clocks (yes, clocks--they featured prominently in one episode).

Malden and Douglas were likable lead characters with great intergenerational chemistry.  ""The Streets of San Francisco"" was a totally cool cop show that was underrated--it was overshadowed by more famous police dramas of the era but really was one of the best series of its type back in the Seventies.",1425340800,,1415,5.0995670995671

3515798,5,B001CQONQ8,I have had a huge crush on Michael Douglas since I first saw this series in 1972.  The rapport between Stone and Keller is believable and I LOVE the city of San Francisco where they actually filmed the series rather than on a Hollywood back lot.  Great show.,1420156800,,258,4.354166666666667

3515800,5,B001CQONQ8,"One of my all time favourite shows.  Magical chemistry between actors Karl Malden and Michael Douglas and the fascination of a beautiful city, San Francisco make this a very special series from the seventies.  Contained on this three-disc set are twelve great episodes all featuring that terrific Quinn Martin opening and memorable Patrick Williams music theme.  As in all QM productions there was always a bunch of great guest stars, character actors and up and coming young stars.  In this batch of episodes guests included Jeanette Nolan, Kent Smith, Paul Fix, Kitty Winn, Darleen Carr (as Malden's daughter), Tyne Daly, Ida Lupino, Don Stroud, Celeste Holm, NicK Nolte, Pamela Franklin, Claude Akins, Barry Sullivan, Glenn Corbett, Noah Beery, Sam Elliott, Robert Hooks and Rosemary Murphy.  May not have been the greatest of television's cop shows but always exciting and entertaining with an awe-inspiring setting.",1412812800,,920,5.361111111111111

3515803,5,B001CQONQ8,"I lived in the SF Bay Area for 35 years, so the sets are familiar - and nostalgic.  The most interesting thing about the shows is that the writers worked from actual SFPD files, so the cases are based on actual events.  That tempts me to play guessing games about the actual people involved, of course.  Some are easy.  The best cop show ever on tv.  My favorite is Police Buff with Bill Bixby, but they're all more than good.  I'm buying a volume at a time until I get the whole set.  I just can't keep myself from watching all the shows on a disc when UPS brings them.",1400457600,,570,4.127272727272727
3515804,5,B001CQONQ8,It's so nice to see a show with imagination not to mention the cool 70's stuff..lt's funny as sometimes one has to go to the past to find progress... Wish they made more shows like this and less politically corect garbage like they try to force feed us these days....Thanks Amazon for giving us a choice.....,1379721600,,308,4.517857142857143
3515805,5,B001CQONQ8,"One of the best series ever on television. Simple police drama and good acting with a great cast and celebrities. The streets of San Francisco was a tv series for the whole family, there was nothing brutal or unthinkable with a label ""parental guidance..."" like today television series.",1373241600,,286,4.979166666666667
3515806,5,B001CQONQ8,"I remember this series from my childhood, and it's still good. Both Karl Malden and Michael Douglas' characters are fully developed, and the storylines reflect the concerns of the day. San Francisco is also a very present,visible character in the series, and it's interesting to see it hasn't changed much.",1365465600,,306,5.14
3515817,5,B001CQONQ8,I am putting together the entire series as I go along. Carl Malden and Micheal Douglas were one of the best television teams ever for TV cop shows. The chemistry between the two worked so well. Both as two individual actors and in the characters they portrayed. You really get the feeling that these two guys liked and very much respected each other.,1357516800,,350,4.571428571428571
3515818,5,B001CQONQ8,"The Streets of San Francisco ran for 5 seasons from 1972 to 1977, and starred two terrific Oscar-winning actors, the always impassioned Karl Malden and the handsome young Michael Douglas.  There was a third co-star, the backdrop of beautiful, colorful San Francisco, California.  Filmed in the style of Hawaii Five-0, the earnest detective stories always came first, with the armchair travelers' delightful scenery of various parts of the city in the background.  This Season 2 Volume 2 3DVD set has 12 episodes, listed below with their featured guest stars:

Disc 1

The Runaways - Jeanette Nolan, Barry Livingston
Winterkill - Denver Pyle, Linden Chiles

3515819,5,B001CQONQ8,It is hard to beat the theme song to this show.  The only one that compares is Hawaii Five-0.  I used to watch this show in college.  Seeing it now brings back great memories.  And the show is very entertaining.,1309305600,3,211,4.2
3515820,3,B001CQONQ8,"I'm not referring to either Karl Malden or Michael Douglas, but oh gawd the rest of the cast(s) were absolutely atrocious. I was always an avid fan of this series and of the reruns. The big difference in crime dramas like this from the ""olden days"" and those of today is the ""evolution"" of good acting from guest stars and extras. So many of the episodes in this series had laughable police procedures and acting from fellow officers and guest stars. Compared to series like Law and Order, The Shield, CSI, NCIS, Southland and even The Closer, this series would be close to the bottom of the barrel; as far as acting is concerned.

Some prime BAD examples: (1) Cops draw their guns with their fingers on the trigger, instead of outside the trigger guard; even if there's another cop directly in front of them. (2) When they shoot a suspect, they run to him/her and take the gun and hold the wound with one hand, while the gun is still on the other; no handcuffing suspects even after they're shot (and a known killer). (3) The comical way they answer radio calls, as if they're talking to one another in the office. (4) One of my favorites - shooting door locks; not expecting anyone to be behind the door (especially an innocent); or ricochet's. (5) Arriving at a gun battle and just joining in by opening up on buildings where the bad guy(s) are holed up and not worrying about civilians in the adjoining houses or apartments. (6) And of course, the greatest of all - the warning shot into the air - no worries about where that bullet is going to land when it comes down (people do get killed that way). Those are some of the reasons I can't give it 5 Stars.

I no longer see this show as a truly serious crime drama. Very few episodes were touching or ""tear-jerkers"" unlike a lot of today's shows. But I still enjoy it most because of the locations where I've been and where I've lived in either 'The City"" or Daly City.",1263945600,,1923,4.414084507042253
3515821,5,B001CQONQ8,"Streets of San Francisco was the best cop show ever on television.  The dvds are of very good quality, both visually and the soundtrack.  I was a fan of the orginal show, so it is most delightful to see the programs again.

3515822,5,B001CQONQ8,"I too am a fan of the Streets of San Francisco, my favorite city, and I know that there are some older epidodes of this series in black and white. I have the first and second seasons in color, but would love to get those older ones in black and white too, before Michael Douglas came into the picture. Not that I don't like him, I just would like to see the older episodes as well. I remember seeing them on TV.
