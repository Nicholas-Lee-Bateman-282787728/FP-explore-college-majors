8394875,1,B003DQJQBM,A bit painful to watch.  Storylines as well as production values are poorly done.  I try to avoid putting this in the DVD player.,1338768000,,129,4.333333333333333
8394876,4,B003DQJQBM,"Charming 60s-based Captain America cartoons! These were based on old Stan Lee stories and Jack Kirby art. The animation is *extremely* primitive, but somehow it works. If you have ever seen the old comics Jack Kirby drew in the 60s and liked them, you will like this. Even with the minimal animation, there was something very cool about seeing the old Kirby drawings moving in vivid color across my TV screen. The simple old stories were hokey, yet heroic. The sense of wonder is there, without the tiresome irony. The stories were black and white, and the hero was never less than a hero, never waivering, walking a straight line to his victory. The stories were consistent with Cap's history in the 60s. If you enjoy that old stuff like I do, you will find this fun to watch.",1290643200,8,777,4.597122302158273
