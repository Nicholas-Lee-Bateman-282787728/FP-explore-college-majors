Second, be sure that you adjust the language as it is primarily in Chinese and turn off the Chinese subtitles. Finally, each episode is about 45 mins long, so it's ideal for showing in classrooms (my intent). Well worth the money in my view.
Now, as for the content, the pace is smooth and fairly quick. It is a documentary, but it is short enough to keep the attention of students. Many of the ideas for each segment may be fairly new, so preview these before you show them in class. I would recommend having a note-taking sheet for students to help them focus on the important ideas of each video.  I can heartily recommend these for the young  (or young at heart) student.  This is not a college level video, but it could be useful for all levels of history survey students.",1370390400,4,897,4.484662576687117
