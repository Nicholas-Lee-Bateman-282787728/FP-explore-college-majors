8657247,5,B00KB49NEE,"This MOD DVD release is of a film I have wanted a copy of for many many years. The picture print and sound are excellent. Much of the film is shot on location at Loseley Park near Guildford. This is one of many Montgomery Tully directed films made at Merton Park Studios in England.
A well made and well acted film with Zachary Scott playing the lead.  Peggie Castle looks lovely. My favourite Lee Patterson looks great. Montgomery Tully used Lee plenty of times because he looked right and was reliable. Plenty of 1950s supporting artistes too. A must for collectors of British films.",1404777600,9,585,4.625
