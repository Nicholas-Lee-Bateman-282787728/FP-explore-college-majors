8294098,5,B0001BMMBS,"This is by far one of the best Gundam series I have ever seen. This final volume ends the series off with a bang as Domon Kasshu goes face to face with Master Asia and the Dark Gundam (Devil Gundam).

The battles with Domon Kasshu and his teammates are absolutely a must see. They set the standard for what Gundam battles should look like.

I really appreciated the nice plot twists that managed to pop up around the last remaining episodes. They defintely made the series a whole lot more engaging.

Pick this series up! You will not be disappointed.",1204416000,,551,4.49

8294103,5,B0001BMMBS,"Domon's matches against his SA friends continue. Although close, Domon manages to come out on top. However, Wong refuses to give in and plans one final match before the Battle Royale- Domon vs Schwarz. After this, the final battle of the Gundam Fight begins. Secrets will be revealed and one of the fighters will walk away with the Gundam of Gundams champion title. However, although the Fight may be over the story certainly isn't. The Shuffle Alliance and the rest of the world's Gundams head into space for the final dramatic battle...
I've been a fan of this great show ever since I could get my hands on fansubs of it. I've been quickly snapping up each of these 4 boxsets and have enjoyed seeing one of my favourite Gundam shows on DVD. This box contains some of the best episodes, starting off with a bang in the shape of Domon's finals match against Sai. For the last few episodes, the show wisely exits the Gundam Fight storyline that has crisscrossed with the show's true story of the Devil Gundam. The characters are thus free of their obligations to their nations and can now fight completly as their guts tell them. In the final battle, look out for cameos from some UC Gundams and other well known super robots. In terms of extras, we get the final 3 parts of the Interview with Imagawa. Suprisingly, there is no sight of textless openings or endings which are a common Bandai DVD extra. The interviews are certainly a great resource for fans as they answer some of the questions that the show doesn't.
This is truly a great anime and Gundam series. Buy it if you have an open mind and intelligence. Gundam Fight! Ready?! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!...",1057795200,,1660,4.649659863945578
