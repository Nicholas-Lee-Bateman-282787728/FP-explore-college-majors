8611121,4,B00F0KV7YI,"This is essentially a story of power - both real and realised. Gary (Tahir Rahim - `A Prophet', `Our Children' etc) is an unskilled worker who heads of to earn- not so - big bucks as a worker at a Nuclear power plant. Once there he gets to know his new team of co-workers and befriends a street wise kid who has a predilection for pick pocketing.

He also has an eye for the soon to be wife of Toni. This is the vivacious Karole (Lea Seydoux - `Blue is the warmest colour'). Whilst the training at the plant is basic there are still ample opportunities for things to go wrong. Further as he is learning the ropes of health and safety in a nuclear situation- he is also learning how to bypass the same ropes. Meanwhile he also manages to avoid the social taboos of going after another mans' betrothed. Both courses of action are going to have consequences and they are destined to be painful.

This is a subtle film on the effects and control of power whilst at the same time being wrapped up in a tale of passion. The thing is there is an awful lot here left unexplored which is not a criticism, but it did mean that you are left wanting to know a lot more. That said the main ingredients of an actual good story are all present. All in all a well made film about real lives in a not so everyday setting - recommended to fans of French cinema.",1423267200,,1343,4.2015503875969
