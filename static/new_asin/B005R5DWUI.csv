8484163,3,B005R5DWUI,"The movie itself is fast-paced, witty, and enjoyable. The cast is populated by one after another of the most recognizable character actors of the time. Of course, J. Scott Smart as Brad Runyon is magnificent to watch. As to the quality of the DVD; this is another matter. The credits appear over a garbled musical-soundtrack. This distortion clears up as the story opens but an undercurrent of rushing noise persists for another five or ten minutes, Afterwards its smooth sailing, that is if you aren't distracted by the picture which is framed in a screen-centered black-bordered box.",1358640000,,585,5.041237113402062
8484164,1,B005R5DWUI,This video is well below Amazon's usual quality. The audio is also poor. Not worth the money. It is the only DVD that I have purchased from Amazon that I was not satisfied with.,1345075200,,177,4.235294117647059
