8401391,5,B000F8UASE,I love these teachers. I have been a follower of Tracy York since the Buns of Steel days. These videos are not for beginners and they move quickly so sometimes I get confused but I don't care because I am sweating and still moving around. They are tough and effective. All of their videos together get an A++ from me. They emphasize good form and are energetic and motivating.,1191456000,,376,4.463768115942029
