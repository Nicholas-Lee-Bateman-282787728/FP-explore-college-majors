8373660,4,B002M9FSEU,"This collection of four films on one double-sided disc is pretty good by VideoAsia standards.  You won't be getting pristine transfers or enhanced widescreen pictures.  What you will get are four pretty good movies in very watchable versions for the most part.  I will review the picture and audio since you can find descriptions of the stories of these old school fu movies elsewhere.

Shaolin vs. Ninja: Good picture that appears to be presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  English is dubbed with no subtitles.

Shaolin vs. Tai Chi: The picture on this one looks a bit scratched at first but actually gets better and is pretty good.  It appears to be presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It is in its original language with English and Chinese subtitles.

Shaolin vs. Wu Tang: This one is probably the worst of the 4 films in terms of presentation.  The picture is OK in terms of quality but is cropped into a 4:3 aspect ratio; actors and subtitles are cut off.  It has dubbed English with Chinese and  English subtitles that cannot be removed (you can't make changes to the subtitles or languages on any of the films on this single disc set).

Shaolin vs. Lama: The picture is clean and pretty good although it is presented in 4:3 ratio.  The scan is much better than that of ""Shaolin vs. Wu Tang"" so the movie is very watchable (especially if you have an option to use a 4:3 expanded format on your TV).  English is dubbed with no subtitles so you can use an expanded view with no loss of info.

Overall, a very nice value if you do not already have these movies in your collection.",1265500800,4,1581,4.53356890459364
