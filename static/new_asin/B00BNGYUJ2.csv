This film enlightened me in ways I had not expected. I feel better equipped to be a friend, and brother to my female friends having seen this film.",1402963200,,255,4.019607843137255
8571609,5,B00BNGYUJ2,"Finally, a voice for women who give birth to more than a narrowly defined result.  Motherhood is a wonderful avocation but hardly the sole (or more aptly, soul) purpose of our gender.  ALL WOMEN; ALL PATHS; ALL TOGETHER.",1402272000,,220,4.7631578947368425
8571610,1,B00BNGYUJ2,"Too expensive for what it is. This is not a Pro-Life movie. It also is not Pro-Choice. It is about women who choose not to have children. Some, but not all of the women in the documentary, did have one or more abortions; but abortion is not the focal point. The discussion focuses on the reasons why these women chose not to have children. The idea is that we should accept a woman's decision not to have children and not judge a woman for making that choice. Reasons to not have children include not wanting to be a parent to having abusive parents and not wanting to continue the cycyle of abuse.",1379376000,,598,4.348214285714286
