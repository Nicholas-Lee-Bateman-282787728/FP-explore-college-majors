3736275,3,B001OSC4FQ,"I really enjoyed this workout and the flexibility it allows.  However, the music stinks.  Turn on captions, mute the tv, and enjoy some high tempo tunes of your own.",1317772800,,165,4.655172413793103
3736276,3,B001OSC4FQ,"I got on the bike and pedaled steadily increasing intensity like she did, but she never really became challenging.  I take a class once a week and do other videos and sweat my butt off.  I am fairly new to this, but I kept wondering when is she going to go?",1286928000,,257,4.019607843137255
3736277,4,B001OSC4FQ,mindy is great for all stages of cycling.  she also gets off the bike and does a few other exercises too.  just wish there was more than one workout routine on the video.,1275004800,5,170,4.121212121212121
3736278,5,B001OSC4FQ,This is a great workout.  It is a combination of strength and cardio.  Have not gotten tired of it yet.  Almost as good as riding inside.,1271203200,,137,4.1923076923076925
3736279,5,B001OSC4FQ,"Great spinning workout.  Can vary the components of it- make it a harder, longer workout or shorten on days when you don't have time.  Mindy is upbeat, clear in cueing, explains just enough about what the workout is intended to do.  Really like it.",1252281600,13,248,4.590909090909091
3736280,4,B001OSC4FQ,Purchased three diverse spinning DVDs and found this the most challenging and engaging.  It can be repeated without getting bored.  A good workout and good training building lots of heat and producing a good sweat.  (I recently acquired an in-home spinner after years of classes.)  Purchased more of Mindy's DVDs subsequent to using this one.  Recommend it.,1238457600,16,357,5.192982456140351
8331413,5,B001OSC4FQ,"I've been using cycle strong for 2 years and am in the best shape of my life. It's still challenging, after all this time. The cardio is top notch and her exercises are especially effective for abdomen and those side flabby things. Yes, you'll get sick of her voice but won't you get sick of the guy at the gym who screams at you to work harder too? Buy it. Your body will thank you in smooth lean lines.",1410825600,,404,4.1265822784810124
8331414,4,B001OSC4FQ,"I have been doing her Tricycle video for months and wanted a change for a change. Still haven't made it through the whole DVD yet.

This thing starts with a warm up, zones 2-3-4 for 6 minutes, quick rest, back to zones 3 & 4 for 6 minutes (little too long for me as i'm in my 50's) I was drenched, She gets off the bike and grabs weights...works legs and back. Back on bike for 10 minutes, more weights, more bike.

After 35-40 minutes I had nothing left to give. Mindy had stomped me into the pavement!",1401753600,,503,4.122448979591836
8331415,2,B001OSC4FQ,"Boring, terrible background music, and too much talking.  Same thing with some other videos from this instructor.  I think a spinning class needs more strategy and lots of energy.",1395792000,,179,5.137931034482759
8331416,2,B001OSC4FQ,"Was looking for something similar to the spin classes at the gym. Didn't particular care for this DVD, I prefer ones where there is actually a group riding with and not just the one.",1389571200,,182,4.382352941176471
8331417,2,B001OSC4FQ,"I recommend to skip these DVDs. I have Cycle Strong and Short & Sweet.  Mindy, although she appears to have every good intention to provide a good product, is short in many areas.  First the cadence lead is vague, leaving out any kind of RPM guidelines. She bounces around from Zones 1, 2,  3 then 4 without any obvious structure to the program. I would rather feel a buildup as I would ride a road bike. A lot of gibberish instruction is thrown in that is good to listen to once, but that should be segmented so one could skip it next time. I find these DVDs basically unusable.
Overall, a huge disappointment. I will be buying more from Josh Taylor like the Ireland Road Tour.  That is what I like in a spinning DVD.",1389484800,,718,4.296296296296297
8331418,5,B001OSC4FQ,"This is a great workout for a beginner...she does a great job getting you started and the workout is at your pace, so you can use this cd for months....I lost a lot of weight, gained muscles and really enjoyed the ride.  The only negative is that she does chat a bit too much, but did a great job motivating me!",1386028800,,311,4.098360655737705
8331419,5,B001OSC4FQ,"Had me sweating to the very end.  I didn't think I would like getting off my bike to do weight training, however, I found this workout to be a great challenge, and after the 60 minutes, I am wringing wet and I feel like I really accomplished something.  I do it every other day now and would recommend it to those who enjoy cycling.  I have a couple more of her DVD's, and I enjoy them as well.",1371427200,,394,4.0256410256410255
8331420,2,B001OSC4FQ,I was disappointed with the purchase of this product. I would not recommend it at all.  The instructor has good intentions but I think she talks excessively throughout the training and it is not necessary.,1351036800,2,205,4.857142857142857
8331421,4,B001OSC4FQ,"This cycling video wasn't bad. It was prety motivating, I just wish they had better music playing. I felt challenged.",1331596800,,117,4.9
8331422,5,B001OSC4FQ,"I've been Spinning for over a year now.  I have done almost every regular Spinning DVD out there.  I was looking for something different.  Well from warm up to cool down, it was a strong, invigorating workout.  I recommend this DVD to anyone wanting a different workout.",1323475200,3,270,4.680851063829787
