8183651,5,B000O7860U,"Unholy Matrimony (1966) is quite well-made and well-acted by sexploitation cheapie standards. It has a plot and some outrageous action to go with the nudity. The female lead is attractive and likeable. The male lead is like a sleazy version of Kirk Douglas, but he's fun to watch. The highlight is a kinky LSD trip sequence. The highly moralistic narration also adds to the fun.

My Third Wife George (1968) has the goofy humour typical of early sixties nudies. We get to see William Kerwin (aka Thomas Woods), of Blood Feast fame, mugging shamelessly while groping or being groped by nude or semi-nude women. What makes this kind of movie amusing is how hard it tries for laughs. Paradoxically we laugh at how unfunny it is. Of course it also features plenty of attractive unclothed women.

As usual with Something Weird the extras are great. There is a bunch of trailers. The trailer for My Third Wife George contains material not in the movie. Of the other trailers the highlight is The Case of the Stripping Wives (1966), which has great colour and features some seriously scary hairdos on a bunch of topless women. There are two shorts aimed at educating young people about not rushing into marriage. These are fine examples of the educational films of the time and lots of fun. Then there is a March of Time newsreel about marriage and divorce which is an interesting look at the 1950s mindset. Nudist Wedding is some home movie footage in which a few good looking nude women and a bunch of middle-aged nude men with pot bellies give their best wishes to a newly married nude couple. Strangely some of the footage is repeated as if an editor wanted to make the female nudity go as far as possible.

All in all a must for serious sexploitation fans.",1399852800,3,1754,4.651612903225806
8183652,3,B000O7860U,"It's a fine addition to the SOMETHING WEIRD DVD Collection - not a classic or great but enough nudity to warrant a solid consideration. Both movies are about ""swinging"" couples - the women are reasonable attractive and you are interested to see them nude. Most of the nude scenes are a little dark and un-imaginatively shot so that detracts a little ... Of course, there is minimal plot but nothing that really gets in the way of the nudity. Both films are about an hour long. There are three amusing 'instructional' videos for kids on how not to get your hormones in a knot, of course as school & church videos - no nudity. There is the usual slew of 8-10 fun, kooky and definitely R-rated trailers along with a short about a nudists (a nice addition as it focuses only on nubile women :-) ) so still a solid SW DVD but not one of the best but enough nudity to make it worthwhile to consider adding to your collection.",1209945600,8,919,4.380116959064328
