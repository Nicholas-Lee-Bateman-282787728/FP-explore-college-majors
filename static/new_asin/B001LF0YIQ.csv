One of its delights is the way it *unfolds* -- it unfolds the way my Toy Poodle uncurls after a pleasant night's sleep. As you watch, you find yourself getting to know the people and the Dogs of New York and wanting to know *more* about them.  Even though most dog owners have discovered the inherent truths of Dogs of New York, it's good to be reminded of them.  And it's good to know that I'm not the only one in this world who *knows* my Service Dog is my soul mate.

Dogs of New York is the perfect film for a Sunday afternoon at home curled up with your own dog. (My Service Dog Joey liked all the expressive dog-loos and their sounds.)  The filmmaker, Carole Langer, has a rare and delightful Voice.  If Radium City is her gift to the legacy of the Radium Dial Painters, Dogs of New York  is a trip into the sublime side of dogdom, plain and simple.

This DVD would make an excellent gift for the dog lovers in your life -- even the ones who have everything; even the ones who send their dogs off to the Ritzy Canine Carriage House; even the one  who always says Please and Thank-you to her Service Dog just for doing his job.

It through it really is not focus on one such breed{there are two ratties there}, but on the subject of relationships of dog owners, and the need for a better quality of life for these dogs.

  The film covers the people and the customers of the Ritzy Dog Hotel.  Instead of a Moore-syle faust, it shows the emotions and desires of the humans caring for these dogs.  Often due to a busy work schedule, the customers are finding a different way of dealing with their left alone dogs.  What I like was the way the veterinarian, receptist, and the dog handlers talk about the need to take care of neglected dogs.  They clearly love these dogs and will go out of their way to help them and the owners.

  This make a great viewing for the entire family and their dogs love it too.  Mine did!*****",1275177600,,961,4.367231638418079
