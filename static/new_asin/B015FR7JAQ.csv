Posted by David Lambert -- **12/14/2015

Take a Turtle-y awesome trip back to the Time of Dinosaurs with Half-Shell Heroes: Blast to the Past! Join Leo, Donnie, Raph, and Mikey as they make new dino-sized allies, battle aliens from the future trying to rule the galaxy, save the day, and get back home! Dinobunga!

Three weeks ago** Nickelodeon aired an hour-long TV special, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Half-Shell Heroes: Blast to the Past. Shown in a different style than the currently-airing Nick series, it was a 2D-animated story made to look more like the toy line. Today Nick and Paramount Home Media Distribution have announced that the special is coming home to DVD on March 15th. The single-disc title will cost $14.98 SRP...

8733429,5,B015FR7JAQ,They did a great job on this! My kids and I were very pleased and satisfied with the quality and humor. I love how they kept the same voice actors from the animated nickelodeon series. One thing I love about this new series (this special included) is the continuity in regards to past TMNT series. This special continues that tread of quality TMNT versions.,1479254400,2,357,4.59375
