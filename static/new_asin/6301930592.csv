382664,1,6301930592,"My VHS deck would not accept the tape, spitting it out immediately after loading.  Turns out the tape was loaded wrong; I had to take it apart and reroute it so it would play, which it did, reluctantly, with flashes of image, then it ground to a halt.  What's the drill for returning a faulty item?  There should be no cost to me whatever - full refund, return postage paid.",1328572800,,374,4.314285714285714
382665,1,6301930592,"I read the book and loved it from start to finish - you could understand why the beautiful and brilliant Kathe (not ""Karin"") fell in love with the staid, unhandsome Alan. This movie makes you wonder what she sees in him, and he in her. Meg Tilly is gorgeous to look at, but not at all appealing in this movie. And wasn't the girl supposed to be Danish, not German? Oh well. The movie lacks the suspense, tragedy, and genuine love the book so beautifully described. Sorry - the film stinks.",1312156800,,489,4.384615384615385
382666,4,6301930592,"I read the book before I saw the movie, and I agree with the reviewer who said this movie hits most of the points of the book. The actors are not what I expected -- Desland is a bit too stiff and dorky, but he was in the book too, so he seems reasonably well cast, but Karen is supposed to be unbelievably beautiful and Meg Tilly doesn't seem so to me.  The film is slow in parts, but then so is the book. I thought it a great supernatural film, understated and creepy, for those that like horror without a lot of slasher nonsense. I wish they'd put out a DVD edition.",1167782400,9,568,4.0265486725663715
382667,1,6301930592,"This movie is long and drawn out, and after sticking it out to the end it was a very unrewarding finale.  The film does not work as a love story, mainly because (as one other reviewer said,) the English man is so stiff and non-passionate. I could not understand what she saw in him. As a character study it doesn't work either. Her character is inconsistent - at times innocent and ethereal, at times totally erotic and conniving.  As a supernatural movie, well, it totally sucked.  Oh, and Meg Tilly's overly done thick accent plus the fact that in any language she felt she did not have to  move her mouth or speak up made her unintelligible most of the time.",1096416000,,661,4.43801652892562
382668,4,6301930592,"First, Meg Tilly is an awesome actress - I was very disappointed to learn that she stopped appearing in films to give her sister, Jennifer, a chance to also be noticed in her own right.  Second, Meg is absolutely beautiful in an unusual way.  Reviewers who don't appreciate her beauty have become too used to expecting magazine-cover girls.
Third, it's true that the English antique-porcelain collector guy is not sexy or so impactful (although his portrayer's acting also is breathtakingly perfect so I wouldn't be surprised if he's sizzling elsewhere) - He's not supposed to be sensually erotic like Karin - That's part of the story.  Fourth, the supernatural images are not superfluous - They're also a central story element:  Karin's emotions & actions are so intense and horribly tragic that they manifest themselves in palpable psychic energy and cruel, indirect, unrelenting reminders.
It's not at all hard to believe, at least not while watching this film.  I've only ever been able to believe two films' horror elements instead of finding their scare attempts transparent, often accompanied by poor special effects.  Only The Girl In A Swing and The Exorcist made me believe what I was seeing - Consequently I don't intend to ever see either again.  I don't particularly like being frightened but if you do, or you're seeking exceptional artistry in film, check it out.
The only reason Girl in a Swing didn't garner my 5th star is that some of the supernatural occurrences are too confusing at first however they do make sense when your mind's been able to go over them enough times - like mine did for weeks even though I didn't want it to.",1066953600,15,1650,4.871428571428571
382669,3,6301930592,"Meg Tilly is absolutely brilliant in the part.  Maybe her accent (German? Swedish? Supernatural?) is as heavy as other critics point out, but who cares?  Maybe she is not as beautiful (as another critic claims) as the book suggests, but who cares.  Forget about what critics say, watch her performance and judge for yourself.  It's like watching raw acting talent without a body...  If she doesn't make you cry in the first fifteen minutes of the film, than I agree, she's the wrong choice for you, so stop watching the film.
I admit, that the male lead has zero sex appeal, but he also transcends normal acting to the point where he just forces you to accept him.  In other words, he's better than he appears.  The two seem so mismatched, that you can believe they actually might like each other.
Anyway don't be fooled into thinking that the couple are progressing towards insanity as the film develops;  it's the director who ends up going crazy.  It's like he started out cooking a pot of soup, got bored halfway through, than just tossed all the ingredients in at once hoping that something great would come out of the spontaneity.
Don't try to figure out the latter part of the film- it's just stupid overindulgence.  It could have been an interesting love story (how far will a person go for love?) without the introduction of tiresome existential philosophy and needless supernaturalism.  An almost beautiful film ruined by its maker.",1034294400,3,1442,4.774193548387097
382670,2,6301930592,"Alan Desland is a cultivated English bachelor who has taken over his family's antique porcelain business. On a business trip to Copenhagen, he meets and immediately falls in love with Karin, a stunning German beauty. After only a couple of weeks they marry, honeymoon, and settle into life in Alan's hometown. At first their erotically charged relationship seems like paradise, but this, of course, cannot last. Karin has told Alan virtually nothing of her past, and her dark secret eventually manifests with supernatural trappings and threatens everything.

 ""The Girl in a Swing"" is based on the 1980 novel by Richard ""Watership Down"" Adams. The film has one thing going for it; the script does an admirable job of lining up and hitting a good number of the novel's main plot points and scenes. Otherwise, this overwrought melodrama has little to recommend it.

 There is so much to criticize--from the passionless direction to the insipid soundtrack, awful costuming, and poor casting. Meg Tilly in the role of Karin is particularly troublesome. While she is a fairly attractive woman, she does not project the sort of unearthly eroticism that the character requires. Worse, her muddled, affected German accent obscures most of her dialogue. When Tilly isn't screeching ""Alan!"" she is mumbling and slurring her most important lines. Director Gordon Hessler does little to salvage things, as he opts to film most of the important supernatural and erotic sequences in one of two modes--either flat or melodramatic.

 While very few films adapted from novels can attain the dense subtext of their source material, such a film might at least evoke the essence of the story by establishing a strong mood consistent with the novelist's vision. This film, however, aspires to nothing so worthy. It neither succeeds as an adaptation of Adams' complex novel nor as a worthy cinematic effort in its own right.",998870400,4,1902,5.119354838709677
382671,5,6301930592,"Apparently, people either love this movie or they hate it.  I happen to be a Meg Tilly fan, and I rather liked this film and her performance in it.  The film is based on a book by the author of ""Watership Down,""  and it is a rather haunting love story.  The film concerns an English  antique collector who meets a young German woman on one of his trips.  They  fall in love, though the young woman has some dark secrets which she is  unwilling to reveal.  The film is at times a little frightening, and there  is a prevalent melancholic, supernatural atmosphere.  I have read the book,  and I think the film is at least equal, if not superior, to the  novel.
Meg Tilly is an American actress but she assumes a rather thick  German accent for this film.  There is a dreamy, pensive quality to her  performance that fits in well with the tone of the film.  The film is an  English production, so perhaps it will seem too ""European"" for  the usual American audience.  Nonetheless, given the current revival of  spooky movies in the last few years, this is a film which certainly  deserves more attention than it received during its initial release in the  late 1980s.  Give it a try; you may like it.",964137600,27,1197,4.410138248847926
382672,4,6301930592,"Unlike so many American films that are predictable,this erotic/mystery film will demand use of your brain cells.  Meg Tilly admittedly is very difficult to understand because of her heavy german accent, but don't let  this dissuade you from viewing this film. Meg's love interest, an  Englishman, has a sixth sense concerning premonitions that complicates his  understanding of Meg's strange obsessions and the secret she holds from her  past. The ending doesn't disappoint, and you made need to view it a couple  of times to fully appreciate it's inventiveness. If you like a film which  strays from the boring path of predictability, this is the one!",950054400,15,652,5.152380952380953
7817483,5,6301930592,"It was Meg Tilly's best performance in a film.  Suspensful, erotic, and a truly shocking ending made it one of the best films of the 1980's.  Of course, much of the success can be attributed to Richard Adam's well-wrought novel on which the film is based.",1515542400,,255,4.521739130434782
7817484,3,6301930592,"I saw this splendid movie in the theatre, and I also own a copy on Laserdisc.  This edition is the best so far, mainly because it omits a lot of unnecessary voice-overs, but the transfer is mediocre.  It really deserves a sharp Blu-ray edition.  As for the critics who complain that it isn't as good as the book, well, I'd say the same about the earlier editions.  I'm a big fan of author Richard Adams, and I think this version is a worthy adaptation.",1492732800,,452,4.345238095238095
7817485,4,6301930592,"This surreal, erotic, supernatural-themed love story was a real find for me. I had never heard of this film and when I saw it as I was browsing Youtube, I thought I would give it a try. The story centers around an English antiques dealer, Alan Desland (Rupert Frazer) who is content to lead a bachelor's existence. That is until he comes to Denmark on business and makes the acquaintance of a charming German girl, Karin (Meg Tilly). Alan falls head over heels in love with her and the two begin a quiet courtship. One evening, Alan makes an offhand remark about not wanting to marry a woman who already has a child, and this remark upsets Karin. Nevertheless, when Alan proposes, Karin accepts, even though the two barely know each other. Karin is especially secretive about her past, and when she arrives in England tells Alan she doesn't want a church wedding. The two eventually get married in a civil ceremony in Florida but the honeymoon is marred by Alan's surprising impotence and Karin's hysterical reaction when she thinks she spies a dead body in the water whilst swimming.

Upon their return to England, the couple is plagued by strange incidents: the sudden appearance/disappearance of a stuffed toy tortoise, the sounds of a child crying, and yet Alan and Karin's sex life is renewed with much vigor. When Karin reveals she is pregnant, the supernatural events escalate until the shocking climax.

I really enjoyed this film for its intriguing storyline, beautiful cinematography, and the tasteful lovemaking scenes that conveyed the unbridled passion between two people who really loved each other. The love and passion that Karin and Alan share comes across as convincing and sincere and the actors portraying both lead roles did a credible job, even though Meg Tilly's attempts at a German accent did not quite pass muster and I found it difficult to understand what she was saying at times. Overall though, this is a highly atmospheric suspense/supernatural film that deserves a wider audience. For those curious - the story is an adaptation of the 1980 novel by Richard Adams, who is known for authoring the excellent ""Watership Down"".",1427500800,5,2154,4.931129476584022

7817488,3,6301930592,"This is a good movie if you like intelligent ""ghost"" stories or psychological  thrillers.  But very ""English"" and very dry. No gore and only implied violence. The dialogue is hard to understand at times( tilly). The dvd is also  a flawed print. Some bad spots.  Find the book and read it first-- it's really good.",1415491200,,313,4.636363636363637

7817490,3,6301930592,"The VHS reviews pretty much encapsulate the reactions people have to this film.  I'm not really a fan of the movie,  but I wanted buyers to note that the new DVD from Scorpion is a non-anamorphic widescreen  transfer (of an intact, excellent print).  About half the disc encodes nothing and the result is blurry in a home theater.  Scorpion does a great job rescuing films that might otherwise disappear, but these films do deserve a better presentation. Non-anamorphic widescreen belongs in the last century.",1408924800,7,509,5.011904761904762
7817491,1,6301930592,"I have to say that this is the worst film I have ever seen. Saw it in an art-house theatre with a date who apparently thought is was awful too because he kept apologizing. Meg Tilly's performance as an erotic, passionate young German woman was so over the top the whole theatre ended up laughing. As much as a struggled not to laugh out of a desire to respect my date's growing horror, I ended up laughing for a good ten minutes when I finally gave in to the desire to do so. I was a snorting, giggling mess, which got everyone else going in sympathy. I happen to like things that are unintentionally over-the-top; I don't think this was intentional in the least.",1395878400,4,663,4.354838709677419
7817492,3,6301930592,"An young antique dealer from an upscale shop in London travels to Denmark in search of rare finds to add to his collection.
He is a bachelor, close to his mother and one who lives life on the straight and narrow. You cannot imagine him to be the type that would find a sexy young German woman with a mysterious past the type he would want to bring home to mother, but he is so sexually charged from the very first time he sees her that you know the movie will become interesting.
In one scene she cuts her bare foot on a piece of glass, and the gentleman he is, he offers to wrap her foot.
She seductively looks at him and says with her heavy German accent, ""Lick fingers.""
You have to be open to this film, becuase it's a mixture of fantasy and the couple's sexual encounters. Here's what I mean;
she is actually a china statue ( as the title suggests) that has come to life. They are married and living in his lovely home in the English countryside. One evening, they have sex in a gazebo some way off from their home, and he wakes up afterwards to find himself alone in the gazebo and realizes she is the statue come to life.
Karin's mysterious past has some very bad details I will not divulge here so you'll want to watch the movie to see how they are revealed. The European feel to this film made it all the more mysterious and held my interest.",1366848000,,1351,4.2
