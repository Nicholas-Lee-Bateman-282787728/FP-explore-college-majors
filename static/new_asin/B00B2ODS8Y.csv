8561573,4,B00B2ODS8Y,"It should be noted that all of the Bound For Glory series matches during this PPV were worth a total of 20 points each.

Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Gunner & Kid Kash - Chavo had recently arrived in TNA & quickly formed a ""Tex-Mex"" partnership with Hernandez while Gunner & Kash also recently formed a team with both men having one issue or another with both men in one form or another.  Kash & Gunner attacked right away causing Chavo to respond with the 3 Amigos before Kash & Gunner singled out the Chavo by being very stiff & dominate grounding him with holds like the camel clutch & body scissors building to the hot tag to Hernandez who came in with powerful shoulderblocks & Air Mex.  This was a solid opening match with Chavo wrestling the hardest that we've seen him in years.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Magnus vs. Mr. Anderson - This was originally set to be a Bound For Glory Series four way match but D'Angelo Dinero was attacked backstage by Aces & Eights taking him not only out of this match but out of the rest of the BFG series (and it turns out this was also be the last we would see him in TNA).  We saw various highlight moments such as being shoved off the top before the match with his head hitting the ring steps on the way down, one guy being monkeyflipped on top of another, shoved off the apron onto guardrail jaw first, a chair being thrown at one's head with such force that it bent, repeated suplexes on the ramp, and a Van Daminator on the stage.  This was another solid match but came off more as a ""No Disqualification Match"" as they didn't take full advantage of the stipulation with the match mostly staying in the ring & ringside area.

Television Champion Devon vs. Kazarian - A last minute bonus match with Devon starting out dominate in & out of the ring to the point where he nailed Kaz with a water bottle that ended up getting all over the camera lens.  Kaz regained the momentum with his quickness & stayed in control with various offensive moves setup off a springboard from the ropes such as a legdrop & dropkick before he was eventually caught with a spear so hard that he landed directly on his head followed by a neckbreaker that yanked him off the top rope.  A good back & forth match.

Knockouts Champion Ms. Tessmacher vs. Madison Rayne - Madison recently revealed the crush she had for months in referee Earl Hebner that resulted in a bunch of questionable calls Earl made during her matches leading up to this title match.  The knockouts traded momentum while Madison kept trying to make advances towards Earl only to keep getting frustrated that he was calling the match fairly only for another questionable set of circumstances occurring in the end resulting in a controversial decision in favor of Madison.  This was one of those quick ""put a storyline over"" matches in that Earl Hebner's decisions always favored Madison but this would be pointless by the next Impact as Tessmacher won back the championship & Earl was replaced by the new Knockouts referee in Taryn Terrell (ex-WWE Diva/ECW General Manager Tiffany).

Tables Match: Jeff Hardy vs. James Storm vs. Bully Ray vs. Robbie E - While this is the second Bound For Glory Series match of the evening, the bigger story was the mystery behind the group of Aces & Eights with James Storm was being accused of being the leader of the group by various individuals including Bully Ray who the group openly stated was their next target.  Robbie E kept mouthing off at everyone making him the odd man out with everyone getting their shots on him in the beginning before everyone made various attempts to put others through the table such as a double team suplex on Bully that resulted in his head going through the corner, Hardy with a Tower Of Doom in the corner & flying over Robbie on a table to land on Robbie T, Robbie going for a top rope elbow through a table, and Aces & Eights making their presence known.  This was an entertaining match but also took a good story in continuing the story with Aces & Eights, James Storm, and Bully Ray.

X Division Champion Zema Ion vs. Kenny King - King started out in control including an impressive springboard cannonball onto Ion but Ion regained the momentum with a flip dive that overshot King but did hit him in the back of the neck followed by later doing a springboard middle rope moonsault.  Some hard punches by King did end up splitting Ion's lip & a cradle suplex into the turnbuckles that landed him a bit short with Ion landing on his neck followed by various aeral holds like a spinning dive over the top rope & a variation of the Buff Blockbuster neckbreaker before Ion rebounded with offense like a spinning shoulderbreaker with King's face hitting Ion's kneecap.  As you can tell by my summary alone, this was a fast paced athletic contest that the X Divison has a reputation for.

Ladder Match: A.J. Styles vs. Samoa Joe vs. Kurt Angle vs. Christopher Daniels: The third & final Bound For Glory Series match of the night saw Daniels be the odd man out that saw everyone take turns just beating him down while the others watched & waited their turn before it eventually became every man for themselves.  There were some hard hits delivered in this match including a one arm slam into the ladder, Kurt Angle delivering an impactful tilt-a-wirl backbreaker, Daniels using the ladder for a low blow, Joe's snap powerbombing Daniels off the ladder into the turnbuckles & later delievering an overhead suplex into the corner that fell short causing Daniels to hit the bottom turnbuckle & his head, Joe having Styles in the position for the Muscle Buster before Angle delivered a back suplex on Joe causing A.J. to get the worst of it, Styles pushed off the ladder onto the outside with the back of his head bouncing off the floor, Joe & Angle in a battle of ""can you top this?"" on Daniels & where he ended up at the end of it.  Mike Tenay described this match perfectly at the end, ""What An Incredible Match!""

TNA Champion Austin Aries vs. Bobby Roode - This was Roode's last title shot against Aries for the title after stating that his previous title win was nothing more than a fluke.  Aries showed that he wasn't intimidated right away as he spat water at Roode & went for the Last Chancery submission twice right away causing Roode to keep retreating to the outside only for Aries to fly over the top onto Roode twice but got caught on the third attempt hitting the guardrail.  Roode worked over the midsection with various holds like the grounded bearhug, driving the shoulder & tree of woe stomping in the corner, gutbuster, and leg scissors before Aries fought back going aeral with a big double axe handle from the top rope to the floor followed by using submissions like the Last Chancery & Roode's own crossface.  They continued to trade momentum from chops to moves like Aries various dropkicks or Roode's spinebuster & spear with the referees becoming casualties along the way while Roode tried to resort to desperate measures like using the title belt.  This was no different than their previous match in that it was a quality wrestling main event from both men.

In the end, this was the best edition of this PPV since the beginning dating back to the regular Hard Justice days with everyone stepping their game up to deliver matches that were better than average at the very least with the only minor thing negative to say here was the Knockouts Title match.  One of the best PPV's they've delivered all year that I would recommend seeing.",1359936000,3,7539,4.564444444444445
