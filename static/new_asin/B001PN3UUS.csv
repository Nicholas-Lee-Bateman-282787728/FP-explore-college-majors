8333846,4,B001PN3UUS,"To tell you the truth folks, I don't know whether I am reviewing the right DVD or not. The DVD I am trying to review is entitled ""Stars of the Russian Ballet"" TOM 3 (volume 3) it has a picture of a ballerina in a white tutu in front of red drapes. All the wording on the keep case is in the Russian language using Russian script. There are English subtitles on the chapters menu. If you skip the chapters menu and can't read Russian, you will be lost.

The reason I have these DVDs (Volumes 3&4) is because a good friend of mine ordered these DVDs in the PAL format by mistake and could not play them. She knew I could, and she gave (yes gave) them to me. I can't tell you who is responsible for the confusion created by all these ""Stars of the Russian Ballet"" is, but confusing it certainly is. There are at least 7 DVDs for sale entitled ""Stars of the Russian Ballet"". Five of them have these numbers:

1.  D1199 by Kultur, (reviewed by me on Amazon)
2.  LVDVD-279, TOM 1, (reviewed by me on Amazon)
3.  LVDVD-280, TOM 2, (reviewed by me on Amazon)
4.  LVDVD-535, Tom 3, (this review) PAL (The catalogue number may be different for region 1 DVDs)
5.  LVDVD-552, Tom 4, (to be reviewed) PAL (The catalogue number may be different for region 1 DVDs)

All of the above DVDs are entitled ""Stars of the Russian Ballet"". When you get to the Chapters menu of  LVDVD-535 (This review) you will see that they have broken down the chapters thusly:  Film 14 (chapters 1 thru 10), and; Film 15 (chapters  1 thru 7). I will list them in such a way that you can copy it, cut it out, and use it as a table of contents for your DVD should you order it. Be assured, these are good quality DVDs, but be sure what region code you are ordering. (PAL or NTSC) First I will Give the title of the dance, the year it was filmed, the music composer, the choreographer, and last the dancer/s.
