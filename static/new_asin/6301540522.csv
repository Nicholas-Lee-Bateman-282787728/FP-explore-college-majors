7812703,3,6301540522,"Ruben Blades plays Rudy Veloz, a talented salsa singer in New York City.  He's been playing clubs and struggling to get by in the local music scene.  He also sees the older generation of salsa singers fade away, and he becomes determines to have mainstream success and become rich.  He gets signed to a label and receives a fat advance.  Unfortunately, his crossover dreams become a nightmare, and he finds himself selling out everything in which he believes.

""Crossover Dreams"" is a nice little movie with good acting from Blades.  He was nominated for Best Male Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards, losing to M. Emmet Walsh in ""Blood Simple.""  Fans of salsa music undoubtedly will enjoy the film more than the average viewer, as the music is featured continuously throughout.  The movie also features many scenes of New York City neighborhoods, which adds a bit of flavor.  There's many things to like about this small film.

Unfortunately, the story is a bit weak and is told in a rather abrupt manner.  In particular, I almost got whiplash watching how quickly Veloz obtained a contract and then lost everything.  The plot is simply too predictable and mirrors a number of similar films.  ""Crossover Dreams"" is a bit of a mixed bag but is likeable enough for me to give it a weak recommendation.",1285372800,,1302,4.7847533632287

7812705,1,6301540522,"Yes, Salsa is very seductive but as a person who grew up in the culture, it is clear that neither Blades nor Ichaso have a grip on the reality. Buy it for the sake of having Blades entre film.

But this film isn't even good enough for HBO.",1133740800,,239,3.9791666666666665
7812706,4,6301540522,"It's scary how well director Leon Ichaso depicts the people he makes movies about.  Crossover Dreams is the classic movie of the salsa scene in the late 70's and early 80's.  If you love the music and the culture, you'll love the movie.  If you want to learn about it, this is the movie to see along with El Super and Pinero.  Ruben Blades plays the unassuming Rudy Veloz, a young singer on the New York salsa club circuit that dreams of crossing over to pop mainstream.  Rudy goes through some ups and downs, but finally lands a contract with a rock producer.  But his new life is not all its cracked up to be and Rudy's star falls as fast as it rose, and he loses his girlfriend Rosie (Liz Pena) in the process.  Crossover Dreams delivers the heartfelt ""don't forget where you come from"" message -- in this case, Spanish Harlem.  The movie is filled with guest appearances of great salsa musicians, especially the velvet voice and style of Virgilio Marti, who sings the hands down greatest version of the Cuban classic ""Llora Timbero"".  Pick up the CD soundtrack just for this hit.  Crossover Dreams falls short of five stars because of some choppy editing, a plot that sags towards the end of the film, and some one dimensional supporting characters.  The ending could have been better developed.  But the music, funny lines and beautifully filmed images of El Barrio make the movie a great contribution to New York nostalgia.",1073001600,2,1429,4.626984126984127
7812707,3,6301540522,"The film has spice and color, even though the story line is formula, except the part about the girlfriend, sort of a funny twist there. It is about a Harlem Salsa Singer trying to crossover, but his fate is a bit different than Selena. He ends up rising very quickly and crashing even more quickly. I really really liked the color and the shots of East Harlem. I even liked more the music. It had a liveliness that made the film come alive more. I thought Ruben Blades did a great job in acting his part, staying right with his character. His film presence is very magnetic. I also like Elizabeth Pena, although she doesn't have a whole lotta of spark in this film. It was a nice film and I suggest it and recommend it.

7812708,5,6301540522,"This was the movie that introduced me to Ruben Blades, and I loved it from beginning to end. The movie is the BOMB, and the theme is one that today's young musicians better pay heed to: when you make it, you'd better keep your soul and your friends or else you can lose both! I read somewhere that this movie, shot in Spanish Harlem, was made for around $600,000. What a deal. A young salsa singer makes a hit record and then abandons his friends and environment (sells out). He is pressured for a second record, but can't do it because he no longer has his former buddies around him. HE ends up back in Spanish Harlem. But the trip that he took is worth study and analysis, because far too many ""stars of color"" forget where they came from. If you have ""crossover dreams,"" it means that for the most part you give up what you are so you can be more ""marketable"" to the other side. The seamier side of how these stars are ""sold"" to the public is also shared in this movie. IF there's a soundtrack, get it because the music is fantastic and indeed, Blades does have a band and can really sing! He's also got a law degree. You go Ruben!",987897600,9,1134,4.2304147465437785
