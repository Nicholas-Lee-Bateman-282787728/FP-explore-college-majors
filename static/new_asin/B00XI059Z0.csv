8715951,1,B00XI059Z0,"Nice potential, but poor quality acting, really bad sound work, and weak editing made it hard to swallow.",1445472000,,105,4.888888888888889
8715952,3,B00XI059Z0,"When RJ ( Matt Singletary) returns from Afghanistan to south Chicago he discovers the neighborhood is as bad as when he escaped from it. Armed with a new philosophy and new special ops tactics he becomes a youth mentor by day and a vigilante by night. He takes it upon himself to clean up the streets going after the top dog.

Matt Singletary comes across like Vin Diesel with soul. The production incorporates a faith based message which accounts for the many rave reviews. However as an action film, it lacks scenes that show action. The opening Afghanistan scene was horrible. What was with his conflict with his superior that never circled back into the film? The violence is toned down to where we don't see most of the blows, just guys falling over. The sound quality wasn't great which was noticeable on the inside shots, especially the restaurant scene.

If you are looking for an action film, keep going. If you want a pseudo-action faith based film with no swearing, sex, or nudity, and quality is not an issue, this is it.",1441065600,3,1033,4.639344262295082
