The soundtrack provided by Vangelis, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and Miriam Makeba is awesome. The photography is very good study for anyone wanting to be a documentary photographer or ethnographer. Give this as a gift to that aspiring filmmaker that you know :) 5 stars all the way. No flaws on this one, and I bought it used!",1381622400,,435,4.891891891891892
