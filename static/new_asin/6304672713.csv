7878697,5,6304672713,"I agree with the other reviewers who mention a bit of confusion, but there are SF ideas a plenty, decent acting performances by all and a good balance of farcical situations and tight story telling. Although the suspense gets monotonous in places and there are small anachronisms, like the gears on the ""burst of life"" machine, the visual effects are mostly served up with care. Admittedly, developing a crush on Eva Habermann/Zev may have biased my review somewhat.",1134345600,,466,4.987179487179487
7878698,3,6304672713,"This was the first I saw of the series, and the worst--though seeing it out of order, not having seen the first one, contributed a lot to my total incomprehension of the events and characters. Seeing it again, after seeing I WORSHIP HIS SHADOW helped, but still. The computer animation was nice, but the weirdness prevailed. Tim Curry wasn't star of ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW for nothing! The shower scene with Zev was nice, though.",1040169600,,432,4.773333333333333

VHS was great! It shipped in a reasonal amount of time, and was worth the wait.",1028160000,2,117,4.130434782608695
7878700,4,6304672713,"This episode of Lexx takes us to the abandoned former home world of the Bruhnanji. There is no one on the planet except the holographic remains of a former disgruntled inhabitant, masterfully played by veteran actor Tim Curry.
While I found this episode enjoyable and mostly essential to any Lexx collection, because it shows you the prophecies of the time prophet, and you get to see Kai sliced into thin wafers, I just don't think it was as good as ""I worship his Shadow"" and GigaShadow.
I give it four stars for being great. I can't give it five stars, because it's just not quite as exciitng as the other films in the series.",1015459200,5,629,4.526315789473684
7878701,2,6304672713,"This was the second of the Lexx movies - the sequel to ""I Worship His Shadow"".  Having escaped into the ""Dark Zone"" an with the Lexx now under the total control of Stanley Tweedle, the crew searches for Brunis, the lost homeworld of the Bruneen-Gee.  Kai, as described in ""I Worship"" was last of the Bruneen-Gee and had been killed by His Shadow centuries earlier, but had been kept reanimated to serve His Shadow as an assassin.  Sent to the Lexx to kill Tweedle and the lovely Zev, Kai reclaims his memory and joins Tweedle and Zev in escaping His Shadow.  Slowly dying again for lack of ""proto-blood"", Kai spends much of his time in a stasis tube.  When that's damaged, Zev, who loves Kai, convinces Tweedle to take the Lexx to Brunis in the vain hope that they may find proto-blood there.  Instead, they find the preserved but lifeless planet a death trap.  The shared memories of its inhabitants were long ago removed and stored on computer.  One of these - The Poet (Tim Curry) has managed to become dominant.  Accidentally choosing to follow The Poet's fate, Zev and Kai find themselves trapped in a machine that prepares to dissect them and remove their memories.  Tweedle, characteristically, gets trapped in the sort of situation you'd expect him to (The Poet had long ago left his seed in the care of the planet's computer, programming it to impregnate the first life form it could identify as female, or at least not male).  Also along is Giggerotta (Ellen Dubin), an escaped criminal like Zev, but not a criminal like Zev actually (Giggerotta is actually a vile cannibal), and one with plans of her own.
This was a disappointing follow-up to ""Worship"" - much of the action has Kai and Zev strapped to a slab while a buzzsaw keeps getting close and Tim Curry gloats on.  It lacks the frantic action of ""Worship"" and not even the always enjoyable Tim Curry can give this outer the speed it needs.  I actually first saw this episode after I had seen both ""Worship"" and ""Giga Shadow"" the film that ended the pre-series run, and realized that this episode was entirely superfluous.",1015372800,4,2089,4.659400544959128
7878702,5,6304672713,"This is a great Sci-Fi movie. It has great caracters, cool space ships, cool costumes, and a great story line. I highly recommend this movie and the rest of the LEXX series. Every show is sexy, funny, with good visuals and great action. Don't miss it....",995846400,,254,4.543478260869565
7878703,5,6304672713,"Ever wanted to see the home world of the Brunnin-G? This is you movie!! I assume you have already seen the first movie, if not buy it first!! Actually buy all 4 and don't miss a second of the first series of LEXX!
Zev wants to go to Kai's ancestral home and whilst there manages to get into trouble. This time Stanley save Zev by re animating(fixing?) Kai, who gets her out of trouble. Mind you Stanly was saved by Giggarada first, when a long dead Brunnin-g poet trys to impregnate Stanley. This is the last time until season 2 that we see Giggarada, who want the Lexx herself. The divine predessors get into the act as well.
A touching scene at the end for romance lovers. Something for all!",981590400,3,693,4.338461538461538
