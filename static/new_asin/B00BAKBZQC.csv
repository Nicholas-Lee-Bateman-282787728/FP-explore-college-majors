5565062,1,B00BAKBZQC,"I am not trying to be mean but, I have no clue how this movie got a 4 star rating. Im sorry but it was bad.",1406592000,3,107,3.1538461538461537
5565063,1,B00BAKBZQC,"I support independent film, so I watched this one all the way through. The story was good. Acting was not. The feel was that of a pretty good student film. When you have to pay for the film you write and/or direct, sacrifices sometimes are made. I can excuse several holes in Dark Shade Creek's quality if not for the poor acting, directing and writing. A film needs a good script and a good actor to put that script to work. A good director can help erase the awkward moments that are painful for us all. Redone, the storyline could work with a decent entertainment quotient.",1405036800,3,576,4.443396226415095
5565064,1,B00BAKBZQC,not worth the 2 bucks...very boring...but appreciate the effort,1404864000,2,63,6.111111111111111
5565065,4,B00BAKBZQC,"Awesome movie, good plot...not something I've seen before. Great kills...the acting was okay, but the excitement of the film- especially the ending made up for it! If you want a good slasher movie with something that has a new twist on it this is one to buy!",1373500800,,258,4.51063829787234
5565066,4,B00BAKBZQC,"My hat goes off to the makers of this film! These guys prove that it doesnt take high dollars to put out a film that is not only original, but also very creative! A little off with some of the acting, but still rather impressive and enjoyable to watch! I myself am a huge 80s slasher fan and for being a modern indi film, they capture the feel of a true classic! Loved every minute! Its very fun to see how creative a film can be for working off a small budget!!!",1363046400,2,463,4.043478260869565
5565067,5,B00BAKBZQC,Cyrus is a scarier looking killer than Jason. I've watched all 3 and love them! Kills are great! Bound to be a new Halloween favorite. Or if you love horror everyday!,1510531200,,166,4.387096774193548
5565068,1,B00BAKBZQC,"This movie is too long.  One hour and 28 minutes too long.  Where do I even start?  It's absolutely wonderful.  Wonderfully bad, that is!  The ""cabin in the woods"" looks amazing like a house or community center with a big back yard and maintained roads.  The falls are literally the worst I've ever seen LOL, they are hilariously bad!  And the couple in the woods?  A sheet and an afghan?  Really?  After one of them is killed and her guts ripped out he drags her away wearing an amazingly unmarred t-shirt.  That forest is more brightly lit up than football field and the ground is wet and dry by turns.  As many ""falls"" as these actors take there sure isn't much mud on them.  And how far out was this, exactly?  The cop started driving there during the day, and he didn't get there until the next morning.  I am definitely going to watch the sequels.  There is much mocking to do.",1508025600,3,883,4.3580246913580245
5565069,1,B00BAKBZQC,"Cabin in the woods with legendary killer on LSD...still after 40 years. The first thing you notice is the wind whipping across the microphone. Put a box around it or something. The camera work wasn't good and Salisbury isn't the most scenic place in the world, but are famous for their steak made from various beef producing animals. The females were terrible actors, but in all honestly that's how guys in Pennsylvania act, so their acting was good, it just looked as bad. The dialogue was silly. At one time Emma, played by Ashleigh Mankey, was called Leigh, right before they head on down to the stream. Just a mess.

5565071,3,B00BAKBZQC,"Being a big fan of low budget horror and especially the psycho in the woods theme, I had to check this out. Make no mistake, it has it all, crappy acting, poor special fx, and nothing unique, but I found the movie to be enjoyable. As long as you know what kind of film this is, you may like it also.",1457481600,,299,3.918032786885246
5565072,1,B00BAKBZQC,"THIS MOVIE HAS THE WORST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN! THE MOVIE WAS SO BORING, AND STUPID I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH WATCHING, IF YOU WANT A GOOD LAUGH WATCH IT FOR THE ACTING ITS TERRIBLE. THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH WATCHING OR BUYING!!!",1440979200,,225,4.255813953488372
5565073,2,B00BAKBZQC,"This is typical of the home-made horror movies of the past decade. A group of amateurs with a consumer camcorder shoot a film that essentially copies a 100 other horror films just like it, injecting no talent or originality into it.

Yes, DARK SHADE CREEK is yet another ""crazed slasher in the forest kills campers"" story. One of the better examples of that subgenre is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Final-Terror/dp/B00JJOY47I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Final Terror</a>&nbsp;(though even THAT film doesn't merit a Blu-Ray edition -- what's with that?)

In DARK SHADE CREEK a group of horny, drunken (and mostly pudgy) twenty-somethings go camping ... and the body count mounts!

The ""actors"" aren't especially talented. That's because they're not trained actors, but friends and family. Many cast and crew members have Mankey as their last name, so this is a family project, not a professional effort. Not only do cast members lack talent, they also lack the good looks that a professional cast can bring to the table. The men have beer bellies. One of the leading ladies is ... beyond pudgy.

Does that matter? Should one judge a slasher film by the attractiveness of the cast? Well, yes, to an extent. As some of the better exploitation filmmakers all knew (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roger-Corman/dp/0306808749/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roger Corman</a>), if you're low on money and talent, you should at least populate your film with eye candy.

There's some eye candy in DARK SHADE CREEK, though not as much as there could or should be. Too many porkers. That sounds harsh, but film is entertainment, and a good-looking cast heightens a film's entertainment value. Hollywood knows this. Professional exploitation filmmakers know this. Hobbyists (such as the makers of DARK SHADE CREEK) don't care, because they're casting themselves, come-as-you-are.

Sure, looks in an actor aren't everything. There's also talent, charisma, screen presence, personality. Eli Wallach (who played ""the ugly"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/dp/B003EYEF2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</a>) brought all that and more to his role. BUT ... if you're hiring a cast of wooden mannequins for an exploitation film -- mannequins wholly without talent, charisma, screen presence, or personality -- then at least get some good-looking mannequins.

The writing is also bad. Banal -- and even contradictory. For instance, at one point, the campers are sitting around a fire, debating whether the local legend about Cyrus, the crazed killer, is real. One of the women doubts the story because ""This is a small town. They WANT tourists.""

Huh? Essentially, she's saying that because the town wants tourists, the townfolks' story about a crazed killer is obviously false. Yet she just proved the OPPOSITE of her point. Because, if the town wants tourists, they would not be telling a story about a crazed killer UNLESS it was true.

Sloppy writing. The script is just padding, empty dialog and cliches, just something to fill the space between the killings. Sure, the killings are the highlight of any slasher film, but that doesn't mean characters can't be attractive, and have interesting dialog.

The killings aren't especially innovative or gruesome. Bad ""special"" effects. We see a POV shot of an ax coming down. Then a shot of the dead guy, staring up, the ax ""in"" his forehead. Not really in it. Just sort of attached to it, in a bad ""special"" effect sort of way.

Apart from a few nicely-staged shots (e.g., the slow-motion near the film's end), the direction is mostly just plop-the-camera-down-wherever, never mind composition. Editing is also crude and clunky. Images are strung together to convey the story, but without any artistry.

Even so, I give the film 2 stars, rather than 1, because I was reasonably entertained. Understand, you must be HIGHLY TOLERANT of bad slasher films to enjoy this one. Only a hardcore fan -- one who is very forgiving of amateur efforts -- could enjoy sitting through DARK SHADE CREEK. That includes me. DARK SHADE CREEK is bad, but no worse than MANY other amateur slasher films I've seen.

Astonishingly, there's a sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shade-Creek-2/dp/B00TKZ581M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shade Creek 2</a>. This is good, because, according to the IMDb, for many of the people involved in the first film, the sequel is their only other credit. At least working on the DARK SHADE CREEK series keeps them off the streets.",1427673600,,4726,5.6394366197183095
5565074,1,B00BAKBZQC,"they actually made a sequel to this!? yu gotta be F***** kiddin' me!

I think I'll actually pay good money and watch Moses part the Red Sea.",1426636800,2,140,4.185185185185185
5565075,3,B00BAKBZQC,"No scares or thrills or anything like that - but this c-movie, no-budget weekend shoot doesn't - unlike so many of its kind, take itself too seriously. So, expect bad acting, expect silly special effects (including the 10-cent-store ""hillbilly teeth"" prop), and if you enjoy c-horror, you might just find this one tolerable. It's a standard ""weekend in the woods"" plot, with no twists. But, I actually watched it twice, as I found it just plain old fun - specifically because it doesn't try to be something it's not. Hop on the couch, grab a beer (or whatever) and just go along for the ride. There are some truly awful movies in this genre, and this one is not a one-star train wreck.  I liked this, specifically, because there was a bit of talent in the director's chair and with the camerawork.",1422576000,3,797,4.612676056338028

Blond lead actress with white lipstick looks like she needs to be on Jersey Shore. Fat female that I can not bring myself to call an actress could not act her way out of a paper bag.  I cheered her murder but wished it had been more painful for her.  Plot holes come about every 5 minutes, just to name a few, Cop gets knocked out and almost killed by some crazed killer and does not call in backup, supposedly there was a storm bad lightning storm but 2 people decide to go sleep in the forest, also during this storm we see a bright full moon with no clouds.",1513814400,,711,3.9859154929577465
