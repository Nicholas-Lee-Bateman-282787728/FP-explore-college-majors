5310007,5,B009AVC936,You get 4 films.  Two versions of Apocolypse Now.  One of his newer films and also the Conversation and one From the Heart.  One from the heart is unlike any film I have seen at at time it was made totally revolutionary.  It was a Xmas gift to myself and I'm excited to revisit some of these films.  Only issue is the packaging is a little bland but for the price it's still awesome.,1387843200,3,383,4.121621621621622
5310008,5,B009AVC936,It was on sale and worth every penny. I never saw Tetro before this and loved it. One from the heart is beautiful and has the best soundtrack ever and the Conversation is just wonderful. A fantastic package on every level.,1386374400,8,222,4.439024390243903

5310010,3,B009AVC936,"This four-disc Blu-Ray set offers the previously released Blu-Rays of ""Apocalypse Now""/""Apocalypse Now Redux,"" ""The Conversation"" and ""Tetro"" along with the BD debut of Coppola's 1982 famed misfire ""One From the Heart."" The latter boasts a HD remastered (1.33 fullscreen) transfer with 5.1 DTS MA audio and fine supplements reprieved from the older DVD release, though there is some odd filtering in the transfer throughout (almost looks like you're watching the film through a net, especially if you look closely enough). Still recommended for Coppola enthusiasts, though the fact that the set only includes one new-to-Blu title and isn't comprehensive may restrict its appeal to most buffs (note that ""Apocalypse Now"" doesn't contain the special features from its three-disc Blu-Ray release either; just the single, ""movie only"" disc with both cuts of the movie).",1356825600,61,865,5.462686567164179

8538784,1,B009AVC936,"I bought this set for one title: One From the Heart. Haven't looked at the other films yet. Kinda scared to if the OFThH is any indication. This Blu Ray is carried over from the exact same transfer as the laser disc, with lousy, hot colors, fuzzy images, and here and there, hair (literally) in the frame. It's as though the people charged with bringing the film to home video went out of their way to make the transfer as terrible as possible, because they had bought into all the hate this film received (undeservedly) when it was first released. It's not a perfect film, but it is often delightful, and exquisitely produced; not that you'd see any of that watching this travesty.",1510185600,5,682,4.5528455284552845
8538785,2,B009AVC936,They refer to the copy of One From the Heart as being ratio 1:33 and it fools you into thinking widescreen when in fact if you don't remember ratios it is really in pan and scan fullscreen  And a gauzy look to it on top of that  DIsappointed since that was the main one I was looking for Already ahve the two Appoc movies on BR  Touts HD remaster but I don't see it on that one,1465171200,4,377,3.8701298701298703
8538786,3,B009AVC936,"Redux This....dump the original Apocalypse Now keep the other 4 films and add - ""Heart of Darkness""  now that's a deal worth talking about....",1461110400,,142,4.916666666666667
8538787,5,B009AVC936,"This is simply a great buy. A fantastic bargain! The fact that the set includes 'Apocalypse Now' (both the original release and the later 'Redux' , extended version ; I prefer the original cut, but nice to have the option) and 'The Conversation' makes this a 'no-brainer' to purchase. The little seen 'One From The Heart' is an obvious misfire but well worth watching, as are any films directed by Coppola.",1460764800,3,406,4.732394366197183
8538788,5,B009AVC936,"Yes, the collection of quintessential films from Coppola. Apocalypse Now and Apocalypse Now Redux need no further comment. The Conversation, a more obscure film than Apocalypse Now, is fabulous. Gene Hackman reprised a similar type of shadowy surveillance character in Enemy of the State. The Conversation may have influeced casting Hackman into the role he had in Enemy of the State. Tetro, as good as it is, may not be in a genre for everyone. One from the Heart, I believe, is underrated. You can puruse better reviews about them than I can write here on Wikipedia and Rotten Tomatoes. The collection is in a Blu-Ray blue plastic jewel case not much thicker than a standard sized one. It contains four Blu-Ray disks on two double-disk hinged panels in the case. Disks are not stacked on each other directly or offset as is done in other packaging. A nice touch. Apocalypse Now and Apocalypse Now Redux are both on one Blu-Ray -- it has plenty of room for both of them with no difficulty. The others three films are on their own individual Blu-Ray disks.",1397865600,17,1056,4.713513513513513
