8191192,3,B000PGGTDQ,"This dvd is only the FIRST epsiode of the Transformers Animated series.  Not sure why they even released this.  If you have the ""Transformers Animated: Transform and Roll Out"" DVD, has the first three epidodes including this one.

It is a bit of a waste of money unless you are collecting it for the cover artwork.  You get better bang for your buck by buying the Transform and Roll Out.",1257552000,9,387,4.485714285714286
