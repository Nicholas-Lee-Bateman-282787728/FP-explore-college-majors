5250686,5,B0092SLPWS,Excellent DVD for beginning students of the karambit. I would highly recommend it.  If anyone is looking for a simple and uncluttered training program for that little curved blade this is the place to start.  I would like to see a further more advanced dvd on the karambit from Guro Siewert.,1371859200,11,291,4.686274509803922
5250687,4,B0092SLPWS,"Pretty good production, even if extremely basic info.  Not much practical karambit video training available.  The niche subculture of this curved, mostly reverse grip blade, is secretive and poorly served for the interested or curious.",1369267200,7,235,5.685714285714286
5250688,5,B0092SLPWS,If your keep knives.  Make sure you knoe how to use and care for your collection.  This blade is hard for a robber to get his hands on while you use it.  Good for beginners who usually lose knives while you defend yourself.,1363737600,2,223,4.1395348837209305
5250689,3,B0092SLPWS,"If you are looking for a basic volume on the use of the karambit, this fits the bill. Though a lot of the techniques are for double bladed (both sides of the blade sharp) you can customize it for your use.",1363564800,6,205,4.024390243902439

5250693,2,B0092SLPWS,Nothing wrong with video or quality. The moves do not blend with my current martial art style like other do.,1435708800,,108,4.45
5250694,4,B0092SLPWS,Good DVD ! Coming from a vast Martial Arts background I found it very informative  on this knife and system and the Author is very good at explaining the techniques.,1433116800,5,165,4.5
5250695,3,B0092SLPWS,"Good instructions, shows numerous techniques from various angles. Video quality is to be expected from that era.",1429920000,,112,5.647058823529412

5250702,3,B0092SLPWS,The video was ok. It provides some interesting techniques. Keep an open mind when you watch this.,1405468800,,97,4.764705882352941
5250703,3,B0092SLPWS,"not confident if the techniques presented on this dvd  would work in a real street fight when  your opponent won't be so cooperative,

A lot of hand grapping and slicing  won't be that easy if you confronted with wild  and strong individual who fights back hard and won't lets is hands be caught in a grip that easily  like for example a fast striker. Lots of other dvd's are definitely much better and more realistic ' regarding this martial arts style of karambit self defense.

3 out of five",1403481600,4,494,4.48314606741573
5250704,5,B0092SLPWS,Very simple and easy instructional dvd for beginner and this stupid website requires me to waste my time by writing 12 more wrods,1396051200,,129,4.6521739130434785
5250705,3,B0092SLPWS,"ok as an introduction to the use of the karambit. the average person trying these techniques without years of martial arts training, would probably get hurt very badly. sorry, just my opinion.",1388880000,6,192,5.03125
5250706,5,B0092SLPWS,"I have trained a little bit in the use of a karambit, but I was looking for another alternative to where I would not have to spend an arm and a leg for school. This video goes into great depth on the links of training with the karambit. I have absolutely no negegitve feedback about this video what so ever. If you want to learn, then this is for you. Long training video well worth the money I paid. P.s. stay away from the videos coming from the MMA forge of Michigan, they are only 15 minute videos of absolute BS. David Seiwert is the way to go. Thanks David",1388880000,26,562,4.118181818181818
5250707,1,B0092SLPWS,"it's better  watching instructions on youtube.
the dvd picture quality is bad, and also the instruction is not represented repeatedly, with enough explanations",1382400000,4,159,5.913043478260869
5250708,4,B0092SLPWS,"This video is good.  The instructor knows his stuff, and he repeats techniques several times, making it easier to pick them up.  The quality of the photography and the set itself was less impressive.

I don't know what else is out there as far as training videos with the karambit, as it is a somewhat esoteric weapon (at least in America), so kudos to Guro Seiwert fot making this available.",1382140800,8,392,4.571428571428571
5250709,5,B0092SLPWS,The moves and techniques shown in this DVD have shown me so much more about this instrument than I thought it would!!!,1379894400,,118,4.409090909090909
8534858,3,B0092SLPWS,Not very informative in the way they present I would say but not awful either.,1527638400,,78,4.266666666666667

8534860,4,B0092SLPWS,Should show moves at angles. Also the defences are not at clear as i would like. Some of the break aways were not clear.,1523318400,,120,4.041666666666667
8534861,5,B0092SLPWS,Love it!,1509753600,,8,3.5
8534862,5,B0092SLPWS,"Great instructional video that starts with the basics.  Too many videos start assuming everyone watching already has basic knowledge of this complex blade.  I had some training in the blade before I got this video, but nice to have basic refresher and drills to hone skills.  The basics are the heart of any technique.",1508716800,3,318,4.851851851851852

8534865,5,B0092SLPWS,This DVD has been a life changer for me as an instructor.  The techniques were easy to master. I followed up by becoming a certified instructor in Filipino Kali and the Karambit all through DVD'S from the instructors website. I now teach and thoroughly enjoy it. The students are great!,1494374400,3,286,4.72
