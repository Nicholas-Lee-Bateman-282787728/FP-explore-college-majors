2764670,4,B000ND91S6,"This double feature DVD is well worth the watching as it illuminates one of the most powerful and faninating couples of the 20th century.  From their early years to the final journey of President Roosevelt from Warm Springs to Washington D.C. you will be rivetted by their relationship.  I highly recommend this DVD set.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eleanor-and-Franklin-Double-Feature-The-Early-Years-The-White-House-Years/dp/B000ND91S6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eleanor and Franklin Double Feature (The Early Years / The White House Years)</a>",1181260800,3,586,7.478260869565218
2764671,5,B000ND91S6,"In comparison with Warm Springs, Franklin was a complete different man in this movie.  Outstanding performances by all actors.  This movie was highly captivating.  This movie helps you to understand Eleanor Roosevelt and what she went through in her marriage to Franklin.  Great movie!",1178668800,13,285,5.409090909090909
2764672,5,B000ND91S6,"The ABC Miniseries of 1976/1977 has been transfered, and to my eyes the color has been restored, so they both look as good as the original presentations. A plus is that they are presented in a widescreen version.  I have never seen them in that presentation format. HBO has does an excellent job on these TV films - I hope they work on other old TV films! And who can argue with a price - two top notch discs for a price one paid for the original DVD release of THE EARLY YEARS! The story of the Roosevelts based on the Lash book presented in an excellent story transfer to film.",1178064000,29,579,4.216216216216216
2764673,5,B000ND91S6,"The original miniseries were 200m and 156m respectively, and the ""product details"" on this DVD omit the running time of the discs, so I am buying them on faith that they haven't been butchered to fit.  Both movies were excellent, and I hope they survived the transfer intact.",1177113600,10,275,4.729166666666667
2764674,5,B000ND91S6,"This is the sequel to Eleanor and Franklin with the same outstanding cast and creative team. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning biography, this is television at its absolute zenith. Superb cast, script and direction! There have been some errors in identifying what these titles are. The first miniseries was Eleanor and Franklin that told the early years of their lives in flashback. This is the sequel--Eleanor and Franklin--the White House Years, that continues with Franklin's presidency. This ranks with the other 2 most outstanding miniseries of all time:Roots and Holocaust.",1171497600,10,581,5.395604395604396

2764696,5,B000ND91S6,OK these were done by ABC and aired in 1974. The actors are the same in both movies which is great. This dvd collection is a must for for presidential library collection. Fix some popcorn and enjoy the show. Watched with my mom as we LOVE history and we enjoyed them very much. To age the actors well ya have to get use to that but the movies are good as told or remembered thru Eleanor's eyes. I have been watching for these dvds for some time as some sellers think they may get big big bucks out of this dvd...don't do it...it will come around for a reasonable price. Well worth watching. Clips are on Youtube.,1423785600,,612,4.239316239316239

2764700,5,B000ND91S6,"Edward Herrmann and Jane Alexander are wonderful in this series.

 ""Eleanor and Franklin"" spans 40 years in the relationship of two of the most important people of the 20th century, but it makes all the old material seem new again. And, most importantly, the filmmakers and the actors respect FDR and Eleanor too much to shoehorn unnecessary emotions and showy scenes into their famously rational marriage.  The Roosevelt's were in the White House during the most eventful decades in American history, but the two of them somehow managed to remain cheerful and reasonable despite all the storms that raged around them, and this movie explains their bond as the meeting of two very intelligent minds.  The FDR we know is the wheel-chair-bound, bowtie-wearing, smooth-as-silk politician from the Depression and WW2, but Herrmann presents him as a well-meaning nerd who can't help but be drawn to a bold reformer like Eleanor.  Yes, they have their problems and they eventually grow apart, but they still need each other and their relationship comes off as sort of sweet in the end.

This movie isn't going to knock your socks off, but it covers a lot of ground and it is very educational.",1413676800,,1186,4.934673366834171
2764701,4,B000ND91S6,"I saw this movie many times when I was a kid because they used to show it on the television quite often.  Only they usually would only show the ""early years"" and never the ""White House"" years.  The last time I saw that one was when I was in high school.  The quality of the DVD is excellent and the price was excellent although I think the shipping cost was a bit high.  I ordered 5 DVD's but because they all came from different vendors, I had to pay almost $4 shipping on each one.  Amazon should give you a break when you purchase several at the same time even though they are from different vendors.  I gave this a 4 star rating because although the film is excellent, it is not 100% historically accurate.  I studied FDR for years as an adult and some things are incorrect, especially in the ""White House"" years film.",1413417600,,822,4.264516129032258
2764702,5,B000ND91S6,"I remember seeing this on TV when it first aired in 1976. I never forgot the music and was always looking for it. Jane Alexander's performance is riveting as the wife of FDR and the mother of six. Her heartbreak over her husband's infidelity,her uncertainty about herself, and her emergence as one of the most admired women of the twentieth century, makes for a heart-rending performance.",1412985600,2,388,4.893939393939394

2764705,1,B000ND91S6,Surely the fact that his edition is only 2/3 the length of the well-received 2007 edition is damning.  Why did they do this? This was one of the greatest television programs ever produced and it is a shame to see it cut.,1410739200,6,220,4.238095238095238

2764707,5,B000ND91S6,"My 2 favorite DVDs of all time.  I think Eleanor Roosevelt seemed to be a little vindictive--she wasn't around much when FDR needed her during WWII.  She was somewhat better in The Early Years.  No wonder the poor man turned to The Lovely Lucy.  Edward Herrmann is absolutely fantastic in the role (even looks like FDR) and Jane Alexander puts forth a stellar performance.as she does in everything I've seen her in.

Well worth the money and if you are a history buff like me, you will enjoy it tremendously.  J. Davis, Knoxville, TN",1405987200,,533,4.617021276595745
2764708,5,B000ND91S6,I saw this series on television many years ago and I still love it - glad I made the purchase,1405987200,,93,3.7
2764709,5,B000ND91S6,I've watched it many times and it is a dear story about two people as a couple and as individuals. Neither could have been alone what they were together.,1405814400,,153,4.310344827586207
2764710,1,B000ND91S6,"I saw the movie on VCR and it was great.  The DVD left out the whole middle part of the movie.  So if you want to see the whole movie, I would not recommend buying this particular version.",1404604800,15,188,3.9210526315789473
2764711,5,B000ND91S6,"This is one of my favorite mini series of all time. Jane Alexander was amazing in her transformation into Eleanor. She looked so much like her, it  amazed me and had that firm but compassionate attitude Eleanor was famous for. She deserved that Emmy. My favorite was The Early Years, as the love story was very touching between them. You also got to see how the Mercer affair really affected them for the rest of both of their lives. Ed Herrmann was great too. He had the walk , the talk and the look down pat. Once again, The early years won out on his end too. I'm a romantic at heart and it was great to see a woman that knew she wasn't the most beautiful on the outside, yet her beauty from the inside was so overpowering that it didn't matter. All the cousins that made fun of her in her youth and teenage years were shocked when Eleanor got the prince in the end. Mrs. Roosevelt was responsible for so many of our programs we have today by pushing Franklin to pass them. .i.e. G.I. bill, Social security and more. I loved both when it came out in 1975 or 6 and I'm glad I own them. Well worth the investment. Footnote. I wish they had released the soundtrack , as I LOVED the score and felt it was one of the great, John Barry's best work.",1404518400,,1245,4.1875
2764712,5,B000ND91S6,"This collection covers the years before the White House and the White House years.  You see Eleanor and Franklin from, age six until they marry is the first installment and the second from when Franklin was assistant secretary of the Navy through their years in the White House through his death in the second installment.  They are fascinating films that cover quite a history with I'm sure some liberties were taken but from what I read about these people its pretty close.  One of the sons was attached to the project as a technical adviser.",1397779200,6,544,4.705263157894737
2764713,5,B000ND91S6,I loved it as much the second time around. Interesting and did not want it to end. I looked up more information on the characters and the time they lived. That is a good miniseries!,1394928000,,181,4.2
2764714,5,B000ND91S6,"My husband and I enjoyed this movie when it ran on Public Television, probably in the '70's.  The ""rerun"" is everything we expected.  It still is interesting and very well acted.  It is a great piece of history and we will share it with our Grandchildren if we are ever able to get their noses out of their ""nooks, tablets, cell phone and face-book accounts.  Jane Alexander and Edward Herrmann are excellent actors.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an alternative to the insipid television programming offered by the regular networks.",1391990400,,549,4.797872340425532
2764715,5,B000ND91S6,Both movies were very nice. You got a glimpse of their personal lives as well. I was very moved by both movies.,1390780800,,111,4.090909090909091
2764716,3,B000ND91S6,"Certainly a version of these wonderful people I wanted to look at.  I was somewhat disappointed, to say the least.",1389312000,,114,4.7
2764717,5,B000ND91S6,"This one's a classic and one of the best. The acting, the story, and the subject are all handled with perfection. Get it and add it to your ""Let's see it every couple of years"" shows.",1387670400,,183,4.111111111111111
2764718,2,B000ND91S6,"This was the first ever return I had to make. Both dvds froze up about halfway through. I cleaned them and tried them in 3 different players with the same result. This has nothing to do with the content, what I was able to view I liked, but the freeze ups/lock ups made watching it frustrating. I have to add that the return process was wonderful and hassle free. I was hesitant though to order a replacement since this may have been a manufacturing defect.",1383955200,4,457,4.3882352941176475
2764719,4,B000ND91S6,I enjoyed it and found it interesting and could recommend to anyone interested in stories about U.S. Presidents. Or anyone interested in History.,1382054400,,145,5.3478260869565215

In the course I teach, Values Based Leadership, I use ""Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times"" as a text.  I wrote the book.  I also use films to accompany the chapters which deal with major leaders of the past and present. One of them is Eleanor Roosevelt.  This production is splendid and gives us a feel for her personality, the times in which she lived, the obstacles she faced, as a person and as a woman, and the leadership qualities she exhibited.  The longest chapter in ""Profiles"" is about Eleanor Roosevelt.

The first chapter of ""Profiles"" deals with leadership theory and practice and the concept of being able to ""lead ourselves"" before we lead others.  The essence of the book is the Leadership Secrets, Leadership Traits, Leadership Lessons and Words of Wisdom of several larger than life leaders: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Napoleon, Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher and Oprah Winfrey.  Each faced enormous challenges and taught us life long leadership lessons that are as fresh today as they were when they led others. They give us insights that we can use at this moment and every moment.  The book is designed to be a compass and road map for leaders of all ages.

These movies go hand in hand with ""Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times"" and give us a complete picture of an amazing leader who still captivates our mind and imagination, many years after she left the world scene.",1380758400,,1674,5.428571428571429

She Was sent to a Paris Boarding school where she blossomed as a strong intelligent young woman. Upong her returnto the USA she meets dashing and handsome Franklyn and the rest, as they say is history. The second film shows FDR being stricken with polio, his recovery and his subsiquent presidency. He liked the ladies and Eleanor was long suffering but strong enough to become his eyes, ears and legs up until his death.",1377388800,,524,4.833333333333333
2764722,5,B000ND91S6,"There are so many facets to this DVD. If you are interested in a study of human relationships it is for you. It is also a love story that survived in its own way. It is about how great people develop over time and bring out the best in each other, eventually bringing out the best in the United States of America and with impossible adversity to deal with. It is also well written and acted. Jerree Crouch",1376006400,4,405,4.205128205128205

2764724,5,B000ND91S6,"Not a complaint to be voiced.
Well produced for the time. It was enjoyable and gave a good long glimpse into the Roosevelts. Not an in depth biopic but a good beginners choice.",1370649600,,176,4.363636363636363

2764726,3,B000ND91S6,"While the production of Eleanor and Franklin was excellent, I was disappointed and felt let down by the series.  The show focuses too much attention on Eleanor and not enough on Franklin (who by the way was one of our greatest Presidents and war leaders).  The series should have been entitled; ELEANOR with FRANKLIN in very small letters.  I wron't watch it again.",1367280000,,365,4.761904761904762
2764727,4,B000ND91S6,This was a very good miniseries that I enjoyed when it aired. I bought it to watch again to remind myself what good TV was like and out of interest in American History. It pulled a lot of bits of information together and created a story line using the work of reports. It takes FDR past the polio and rehab all the way through to his death. Edward Herrmann was a good fit for the role and allowed the viewer to focus on the story not on the actor. It covered the sexual aspect of the marriage and presidency. It also showed the political situation  and the events of World War II but not in great detail. It was mainly covered from the perspective of ways they affected the marriage. There was very  little coverage of the Roosevelt family beyond Husband and Wife. There was very little action and less adventure but when the reader remembers that FDR was wheekchair bound it makes sense. I will watch it again over the years.,1366848000,,926,4.377906976744186
2764728,5,B000ND91S6,"I was born in the summer of 1932 in Poughkeepsie, New York.  FDR
was first elected in November of that year.  He lived in Hyde Park, just
up the road from where I lived through high school.  We both had polio.
We were both Democrats and political junkies.  I spent 8 hours viewing
this double feature and WARM SPRINGS.  i learned much about the man,
his wife and his life.  I highly recommend this dvd for those captivated by
history, politics and the public and private iives of the privileged who cared
for the downtrodden.",1366156800,,525,4.473684210526316
2764729,5,B000ND91S6,I am a big fan of dynamic story lines and this mini-series delivers in bunches. The acting and mannerisms are so rich and detailed that you come away thinking you were living in that time. My study of the Roosevelts is that they nailed it. Nothing is left out to include FDR's affair. You find yourself in one with the courageous and modest looking Eleanor whose kindness was known by the Greatest Generation. There are some really heart rendering scenes in this DVD. I am glad I found it.,1365552000,,489,4.50561797752809
2764730,5,B000ND91S6,I remember seeing this when it aired on TV.  The story is timeless and the acting was superlative.  I've watched it several times since then and it is still fresh and topical.  Glad I bought the DVD.,1362268800,,199,4.324324324324325
2764731,5,B000ND91S6,"Very human, highly relateable depiction of the lives of Eleanor Roosevelt and her husband Franklin.  Jane Alexander and Edward Herrmann are great in the title roles.  The Early Years focuses on Eleanor's growth from conventional, underachieving wife of a wealthy, ambitious politician to a strong, able partner of the polio-stricken future president -- the woman who would become the most remarkable first lady in history.  Rosemary Murphy and Ed Flanders are memorable as, respectively, Franklin's formidable mother and loyal campaign lackey.  The White House Years shows highlights of the accomplishments of the Roosevelt Administration with highly personal and relateable insights.  I loved both series when I first saw them in the 1970s.  I found that they held up amazingly well to the test of time when I saw them again a couple weeks ago.",1360886400,,845,5.268656716417911
2764732,5,B000ND91S6,I found this DVD so very interesting and I saw/learned information that our History books do not contain. Eleanor's storytelling starts at the death of the President and she relives her important memories however you do not lose track as she goes from present to past! I found this movie to be very interesting and well made and who Highly Recommend it!,1360368000,,353,4.709677419354839
2764733,5,B000ND91S6,This is a classic series that stars Jane Alexander and Edward Herrman as Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt.  I'm so glad to have this great series.  It's long but good.,1358121600,,165,4.655172413793103

2764735,5,B000ND91S6,"I learned so much about the early influences forming Eleanor and how the marriage with Franklin  evolved, and I really enjoyed it. Though historical fiction, it felt like it could have actually happened. Enjoyed the scenes at the homes and costumes of the early 1900's and late 1800's. Well done in my opinion",1356739200,,309,4.830188679245283

2764737,5,B000ND91S6,This is a very good down to earth movie of the life and times of these two American people who had been appointed to serve this nation at such a time when they did. It does not try to make them into something they were not nor gloss over their weaknesses but all is handled with integrity which is as it should be. This comes highly recommended.,1355961600,,345,4.164179104477612

2764739,4,B000ND91S6,"This is good but still does not tell enough of the real relationship between Eleanor and Franklin. Of his numerous affairs and the somewhat strange and cold person that Eleanor was. And of course there is Mama Roosevelt who controlled Franklin almost all his life. I love history so I do know more than what is shown in the movie, but it is still good. It gives the viewer just enough to make them want to know more especially the White House years which were the most interesting. I have watched it several times.",1344988800,,514,4.4787234042553195
2764740,5,B000ND91S6,"I can't think of another movie about a US president (and his wife) that is nearly as good. In just about every respect--casting, sets, music, etc.--this is a masterpiece and deserved every award it received and then some.  It's hard to believe that it's more than 35 years old; it ages well--much better than such old biopics as Henry Fonda's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"". I also appreciated the earnestness with which the movie attempts to remain faithful to history (unlike, say, Oliver Stone's ""Nixon""). The only negative critique I have was that the make-up job was way overdone in the ""The Early Years""; one of the final scenes depicted E and F considering a run for governor in 1928 when they were in their mid-40s, but they were made up to look like they were in their mid-70s!",1344297600,,775,4.656934306569343

They pretty much had it all, but they devoted their lives to helping those who were poor and/or suffering.

The backgrounds and wardrobe couldn't have been better. The actors captured the emotion behind the events that I had always heard about.

Jane Alexander carries the show and did a masterful job of capturing the speech, diction and ""feel"" for Eleanor, but other than that....  The sets and costumes are tacky and garish, the use of color is overblown, and in every way it looks like a high school production.  The make up to ""age"" Eleanor for the confrontation with her daughter regarding Franklin's final indiscretions is horrid and third rate (compare to what was done with Cicely Tyson in ""Jane Pittman"").  The monologue of Anna to Eleanor at that point is dreadful whitewash.  Not to mention implausible.  For a woman nearing 40, Anna sounds as naive as a school girl and about looks like one.  The immobile helmet of hair didn't help.  It is additionally difficult to envision Eleanor being much upset about finding Lucy was present the day FDR died; any intimacy she and Franklin may have had was long gone by that time, as indicated by her refusal to resume a combined household, a request made by FDR in 1942.  She had moved on from him a long, long time ago by then.  This miniseries could have been much, much more and with a better script, better costumes and sets, and better direction would have been.

2764763,5,B000ND91S6,"'Eleanor and Franklin' is a wonderful miniseries excellently acted by the principals Jane Alexander as Eleanor and Edward Hermann as FDR. 'The Early Years' is especially striking and uses wonderful on location photography of FDR's homes in Hyde Park, New York and Warm Springs, Georgia. The elliptical way the story is done in the first part is also well done. The funeral train of FDR is portrayed in a very historically accurate fashion and in flashbacks Eleanor remembers her tough childhood and her courtship by FDR.

The story being based on Joseph Lash's Pulitzer Prize winning book 'Eleanor and Franklin' is told ,like the book, from Eleanor's perspective. I think the series does wonderfully in humanizing these larger than life characters. It handles the depiction of FDR's battle with Polio very well and in a moving fashion. Another performance of note is the late Ed Flanders excellent, funny portrayal of key FDR adviser Louis Howe. He really handles this juicy character role with aplomb in 'The Early Years'. In the 'The White House Years' this part is played by another actor and he is not quite as memorable as the Flanders portrait of Howe, who was such a key figure in both Roosevelt's life. Also worth mentioning is the evocative score by John Barry. The score sets the tone and mood of the story very well.

The DVD has excellent picture and sound. The picture is really quite splendid for a TV miniseries from the '70s and the DVD has excellent color reproduction. There are also scene selections. The DVD does not contain any other extras which is a pity because I would have liked to have heard more from Jane Alexander and Edward Hermann on what is was like playing these amazing historical characters. Viewers left wanting more visual info are encouraged to obtain the DVD of the PBS American Experience episode on FDR from 1994.

All viewers should try to visit some of the personal locations depicted in the miniseries if ever given the chance. Warm Springs, Georgia has the Little White House preserved and has a great museum. It is a must visit for any Presidential buff. Hyde Park, New York has the FDR presidential library and the big house preserved plus Eleanor's beloved residence Val-Kill and Campobello Island has excellently preserved the summer home the Roosevelts lived in for many years and is the house where Franklin had to suffer through his battle with the dreaded Polio disease. These places are amazing and make the real life stories come to life.

2764775,4,B000ND91S6,"I am not a history buff and appreciate those that can give educated comments on this time (WWII) and the most powerful men on the allied side, Roosevelt and Churchill.  I will say the ABC Mini-series is well done and the acting is excellent.  Even if it varies a bit from history or leaves some things out, it is well worth seeing what the US was up against depression/post depression/ WWII.

That said, I felt the story as told through Eleanor's eyes was slanted against Franklin and his deception around his mistress.  The movie seemed very focused on a betryed women who felt Franklin had given up Lucy Mercer.  It is the long drawn out process in the end that showed he had never given her up despite his promise to her and his mother.  So this is more a look at Elanor and how valiantly she became his legs and ran around the US and the world bringing Franklin's political message.  Again, from what I have read in the reviews this is not an accurate portrayal of either of them.  That is why I have purchased the DVD biographies of both Franklin and Elanor.  Somewhere inbetween lies the truth.

Despite the fact it may not be historically accurate from the relationship side, it was beautifully played out from the ascent of Roosevelt through his wealthy family and how he got the US through the depression and WWII.  One of the most moving scenes in the film is when they are returning his body from Warm Springs AK to Washington.  Along the route the train took, it was lined with common people who came out to watch his train pass.  I especially felt when they passed a group of black people and they begin to sing, it told the whole story of what this man did for many who are or were underserved in this country.  Odd how he was born to such wealth and priviledge to be honored by simple people.  Can't wait to get the biographies of both these strong and history making individuals.",1262822400,2,1895,4.436416184971098

I had purchased Warm Springs earlier and found it to be beautifully done, but it can't hold a candle to this.  This dvd has both The Early Years and The White House Years and the running time together is nearly six hours and I must say I was never bored.  I planned on watching the first part one day and the second the next, but was so completely drawn in I watched it all in one Sunday afternoon.  Jane Alexander  and Edward Herrmann  are the Roosevelts and the film, to be over 30 years old, looks as good as anything new.  The direction by Daniel Petrie is first rate and the script and acting flawless.  It says on the box that both won a combined 18 Emmy Awards and I don't know what the other nominees were but this is some magnificent television.

The movie was well acted however, the writing and direction displayed either a strong ant-FDR bias or ignorance of the reality of the relationship between the couple. After their sixth Child, Eleanor told Franklin in no uncertain terms, that she was DONE with sex and she moved to a separate bedroom. She also informed her daughter, (who thereafter felt sorry for her dad) that sexual intercourse was a thing to be merely endured. However, when the frustrated FDR took a mistress ( Lucy Mercer) Eleanor supported by Sarah, FDR's mother forced him to give up her up or be disinherited. While this resulted in the greatest president in our history, it was at his great personal expense.

Nor did FDR in real life, express the short-tempered anger toward Eleanor which the movie displayed, even though Eleanor constantly badgered him for her pet projects (though sometimes those projects represented good causes) even though he was stressed out with the war and the depression.

Roosevelt was exceptionally tolerant for the woman who bore him six children and cared for him in his decades of paralysis and struggles ad FDR was ever the jolly host, though on rare occasion they did spat, he showed her exceptional patience even building a cottage for her and her female friend on his estate.

I suggest instead of buying this pair of DVD's, one read the two books, FDR, by Jean Edward Smith and Traitor to His Class, by HW Brands. Within those 1900 pages is the true story of their life together. One might add, FDR and Lucy: Lovers and Friends, by Resa Willis.

2764780,5,B000ND91S6,"This story of Eleanor and FDR is simply a masterpeice in every way.  The quality of the transfer is second to none.  The story both written and told with so much sensitivity their love of history of the WW2 period shines through in every word.  I remember the series when it first aired in the 1970's and I saw the price.  I figured they butchered the movies or the transfer was aweful.  I was wrong on both counts.  The DVD transfer was beyond first rate.

The run time for The Early Years is 204 Minutes.

The run time for The White House Years is 156 Minutes.

While there is no way to pardon FDR's love affair with his peice of fluff on the side, I understood the man.  FDR was wheelchair bound.  This young beautiful secretary was interested in him back when he was a scrapping virile able bodied man full of energy and hormones.  Nice as she was on the eyes, this scretary was no where near FDR's intellectual equal.  FDR especially after his cotracting polio needed the rich intellectual stimulation only a lady of quality like Eleanor could give.  FDR's love of Eleanor was sexual but it was vitally intellectual.  Eleanor was FDR's safe harbor and unfortunately he took her role for granted.

The DVD shares all the raw emotions with you.  If shares good points and bad.  If offers insights into the country and world at these most trying of times.

2764781,5,B000ND91S6,"This fine set contains two excellent mini-series which were first shown in the 1970s.  Based on Joseph P. Lash's majestic dual biography, Eleanor and Franklin is a deeply moving portrayal of America's longest serving First Couple.

The Early Years is the better of the two series.  It begins with FDR's death at Warm Springs in 1945 and portrays, in flashbacks through Eleanor's memories, their early lives.  Franklin was a spoiled mama's boy, while Eleanor was a shy girl raised by her strict grandmother after her parents' early deaths.  As distant cousins, Eleanor and Franklin met at family gatherings and knew each other only slightly until they reached adulthood.  Their marriage was a love match and their early years happy until Franklin had an affair with Eleanor's secretary.  The scenes depicting how the couple decided to stay together are highly poignant, as are the scenes showing Franklin falling ill with polio and at first giving way to depression, then with Eleanor's support becoming determined to resume an active life.

The second series depicts the Roosevelts during their White House years.  By that time the couple had largely developed second lives, with FDR pinned down by work and paralysis and Eleanor constantly on the move overseeing New Deal projects and later the war effort.  At times the second series seems a bit jumpy and rushed as it tries to pack 12 years, a depression, and a world war into a bit more than two hours.

One day we got a telephone call from someone from the town asking if we would be interested in being extras in a movie they were shooting down at the train station. Of course we (my mother, brother, sister, and myself) were estatic and said yes. The reason they were filming in Burkeville was because our little train station was one of only a few left where the funeral train carrying President Roosevelt actually travelled. Time came for the filming. It was so exciting. We got to hobnob with the stars. I remember meeting Edward Hermann and realizing how tall he was. Jane Alexander was absolutely beautiful. They were all extremely nice to us, but Ed Flanders took a liking to me and took me on several occasions to the local Tasty Queen for malts. (It made me so sad when I heard he had died). But the reason I think I love this movie the most is because just 1-1/2 years later, my mother passed away.

This is a two disc set...the first disc ""Eleanor and Franklin"" originally debuted on TV in 1976. The first disc focuses on their early life, Eleanor's sad childhood, her meeting and marrying Franklin, their early life and tragedies, including Franklin's contracting polio. This first disc ends with Franklin's triumphal return to public life after years of learning to deal with his disability.

The second disc, ""Eleanor and Franklin, the White House Years"" debuted in 1977. The story continues as Franklin, now President, deals with the issues of the Great Depression and World War II. Eleanor becomes Franklin's ears and eyes as she travels around the country, having overcome her shyness to turn into an advocate for the poor, minorities, soldiers, and more.

The movies star Edward Herrmann as Franklin and Jane Alexander as Eleanor. These two actors give outstanding performances. The supporting cast is also excellent, as are the beautiful, lush interiors and scenery. The movies won a combined 18 Emmy Awards.

The DVD's present the story of how these two strong individuals met and fell in love and how they survived a tumultous marriage.  This would be at a time when the world would face the greatest war in history.

Eleanor & Franklin is a 1976-77 production and runs 6 hours.  The series was made for HBO at what must have cost a king's ransom.  Costumes, scenery, vintage cars, and all the rest--production values are at the highest level.  Yes, the Roosevelts were from the upper crust of American society and lived privileged lives.  But they sacrificed a lot for their country in its greatest hour of need as these dramatizations show so well.

Casting is superb.  Jane Alexander plays Eleanor Roosevelt and Edward Hermann plays her cousin and later, husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR).  The outside jacket of the DVD set says the miniseries won 18 Emmys back in the 1970's.  After viewing it recently for the first time, I wonder how the series didn't win more.  It is a true masterpiece.

In the early-1940's, Benito Mussolini is supposed to have scoffed at the idea of FDR leading the U. S. in a world war.  Mussolini ridiculed FDR as a paralytic who could never lead his country to victory.  Not long after, Mussolini and his criminal partner, Adolph Hitler, would eat those words.  FDR's knowledge of world history and past wars, his experience in the military and in government, and his courage and resolve in the face of evil were exactly what was needed.

For all his flaws as a man, I shudder to think what might have happened had FDR not been U. S. President during this time.  Without question, his partnership with Winston Churchill saved Western Civilization.  Through it all, Eleanor was his supporter and confidant, although you might wonder at times if he deserved her.

Anyone interested in the 1930's and 40's and the tremendous world conflict known as World War II needs to add this bargain-priced set to his library.  These DVD's will provide insight one can get nowhere else.",1182297600,67,2095,4.747922437673131
