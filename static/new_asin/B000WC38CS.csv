2964054,5,B000WC38CS,"This was my first dvd of Leslie Sansone, it is a great workout.  Very motivating, you can stop at one mile or go all the way to three.  The workout band gives your arms something to do, and increases your heartrate for a good overall workout.",1204070400,17,242,4.239130434782608
2964055,5,B000WC38CS,"In 2 weeks I have more energy and a waistline is forming. I walk with the belt and without. I started doing just a mile 2x day and now I'm up to 3 miles a day. I will increase 1 mile every week.(With this cd one can increase to 6 miles a day or more.) I am 57yr and 100 pds over weight. This program is not only for people who has only 10-15pd to loose, but for people like myself.",1202428800,118,381,3.7160493827160495
2964056,5,B000WC38CS,"My first Leslie walking tape.  Health-wise, I am unable to do some exercises, but Leslie just walks.  The Walk Belt is just great also!
For bigger girls, belt is only 47"" around, I had to sew in extra webbing.
Tape really got me going the very first day.",1201824000,31,254,4.270833333333333
2964057,5,B000WC38CS,"I am not a runner or an aerobic class person.  I do not relish the thought of being with a group of people to show them my wiggly bits or to show that I have no rhythm, go left when they say right.  This was a great dvd for me...easy to follow...I can keep up and I feel very good after doing the exercise.  I know I wouldn't do the 4 or 5 mile walk so after doing this dvd I was glad I didn't get that one. I thought the price was great too--almost bought one from QVC for a heck of a lot more--go Amazon!",1201478400,42,506,3.710280373831776

2964061,5,B000WC38CS,"Here's another great one from the ""Queen of Walk""!  Even though I'm an experienced walker, this one still made me sweat and the time flies by!  All the ladies in the video are over 40 too and they are able to keep up!  I especially like that Leslie has a water break built into this routine, which most folks need on a 3 mile walk!  My only suggestion would be to keep the studio bright--this one has a black background.",1197331200,192,420,4.2125
2964062,5,B000WC38CS,"This was an early Christmas present from my sister. I have never used any of the Walk at Home videos before. I didn't expect to even break a sweat, but I did. Leslie is fun and encouraging. You have the option to do 1, 2, or all 3 miles. It's gentle and easy to follow, but you do get your heart rate up. I really enjoyed it.",1197244800,91,325,3.8656716417910446

This is for someone 200-400 Pounds and up!!! This makes you feel like there is hope for you! I dnt care for Jane Fonda because she does exercises for skinny people that overweight people can't accomplish. I gave up until I was introduced to Leslie Sansone.

2964104,4,B000WC38CS,It's a good workout.  My only problem is the cords on the belt are just a bit too long for my arms. If the cords were slightly shorter I could get a more vigorous workout. It would be nice if they would offer the belt in more than one size.,1425945600,,240,3.8

2964123,5,B000WC38CS,"The program works when I decide to cooperate and refrain from eating my favorite desserts so much like carrot cake, peach cobbler, banana pudding etc.  I really like having variation in the walking program.  These dvds are timeless and indeed helpful AND doable.  I highly recommend walk at home!",1400630400,,296,5.0
2964124,5,B000WC38CS,"My grand daughter brought this program when she came for a visit.  It was very catchy and I immediately saw that I could walk at home and get more exercise than actually walking.  Oh, I still like to walk, but I can do this when it is hot, rainy, windy or I just don't feel like leaving the house.  This works up a sweat in the first mile.  I still go for walks, but this one is to get me moving and back into shape !",1400284800,,417,3.813953488372093

2964127,5,B000WC38CS,I would highly recommend this!! I have been walking with Leslie DVD's for years and decided to add this to my collection a couple weeks ago and I LOVE IT! It is pretty fast paced and I love that it works the upper body also!!!,1398384000,,226,4.044444444444444

2964131,5,B000WC38CS,"I am a big fan of Leslie, and have walked with her for years.  I ordered this video because it has the ab band to help shape your waste.  The band is awesome, I can really tell I am working the abs when wearing it and performing the moves Leslie has you do.  It is a good way to bump up the workout.",1394409600,,299,3.7142857142857144

2964133,5,B000WC38CS,"I love Leslie Sansone. I own many of her tapes. I bought this particular one for the belt. I had owned two belts previously, but I couldn't find one this go round just by itself. I had to get a tape that it came with. The belt did not look new although the tape came factory sealed and new.",1391990400,,290,3.9322033898305087
2964134,5,B000WC38CS,"Walk Away Your Waistline is another great waistline weight busting DVD that I highly recommend because it works. There's something positive to say about being able to walk in the safety of your home with great company. Leslie always wears a smile and coaches you onward while highlighting all of the reasons that walking makes a person healthier. Also, if you travel, it's easy to take a DVD with you and pop it in the DVD player and go. You can walk in place or move around based on your available space. It simple and easy, which makes these walking tapes a necessity and it works for all ages as you modify your workout to your needs. For example, you can use the waist belt or not--you can walk with weights, whatever your desire. You are empowered to do what you want on that day. You can stop the DVD wherever you want if your time is limited. You have the power to walk off as much weight as you want--which is fabulous!",1391817600,2,927,4.364161849710983

2964139,4,B000WC38CS,"I like the exercise program but the belt is kind of flimsy and was too big for my waist.

2964140,4,B000WC38CS,"I bought this video because I wanted the belt to work my arms. The video is OK, but my arms are short and the cables attached to the belt aren't adjustable for length, so I don't get the workout I want since there isn't enough tension. Just a thought if you are short as I am; if you are not short, and want arm work, this could suit you fine.  I rarely use this video, since I now have other Leslie videos that I like a lot more.",1386720000,,430,3.8863636363636362

2964150,5,B000WC38CS,"I can customize my workout for 1, 2 or 3 miles. The music is upbeat, and the waistband really helps you concentrate on your abs while giving your arms a bit of a workout as well. I lost the belt, but use dumbells now and can still engage the abs, while getting an even better workout for my arms. Leslie also always brings the large muscles into play with side squats, kickbacks, knee lifts, as you get into target heart rate with the quick marching. It employs all over conditioning, while easy on the knees, feet, and back. (I have injuries) I'm going to buy more of her DVD's!",1380585600,2,579,4.321100917431193

2964152,5,B000WC38CS,"I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan.  I liked how she designed the walk belt and integrated the exercises to it.  It is a shorter workout than some of the other DVDs, but it is  a good exercise.  My favorite DVDs are the 5 miles, but you can do this workout in addition to her other DVDs.",1379376000,,283,3.912280701754386
2964153,5,B000WC38CS,I love all of Leslie's exercise videos...they are easy to follow and she keeps you motivated. My daughter has been working out with Leslie for over a year and has gone from size Petite 12 to a size Petite 8. She looks great and loves Leslie's videos. I got one of the Videos and tried it and I ended up ordering  a few more. One more thing the videos are reasonably priced!!,1378771200,,374,4.194444444444445
2964154,5,B000WC38CS,"The ONLY exercise routine I have faithfully followed over the past fifteen years have been the Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds (waistline, Abs, etc.) programs. They are all the most user friendly and realisitic programs out there. The results are fabulous and Leslie makes it fun! Each new series she creates incorporates all the newest information in exercise physiology and is just plain fun! I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to head to a gym, can't walk outdoors, and is just looking for a program that gets you moving without it being necessary to be a ""dancer"", an athlete, or in boot camp. I have tried many others and always return to my Leslie! The belt in this program really gives you a workout without being overly taxing on joints. I love it!",1376956800,,769,4.661764705882353
2964155,5,B000WC38CS,"It's a good workout for me.  In just a couple of weeks I noticed a difference in my body.  So far I have lost 10 lbs, with the help of the tape and better eating habits!!

2964170,3,B000WC38CS,"I like the  video ""walking at home 3 miles with Leslie Sansone"" which I saw on Exercise TV better than this video.  One of the reasons is that using a waistband during the exercise is very awkward.  The other reason is to be surrounded by some women and Leslie chatting to them during the video is a kind of annoying to me.  I 'd rather want to concentrate the exercise and have her talk only related to the exercise.

I've learned the basic steps, the rhythms that she uses during the video , and I can apply these movements through the first video ""walking at home 3 miles.""  It seems to me the rest of them are just duplicates to me.",1369267200,,636,4.214876033057851
2964171,5,B000WC38CS,I used this just a few times this week and I can already button a jacket that did not even come close to closing before I started this dvd. She makes it fun and I love that you do not have to leave your home or learn any dance steps!,1368921600,,233,3.68
2964172,5,B000WC38CS,Typical Leslie style! she keeps u moving and doesn't disappoint. Fantastic! U won't be disappointed! And the results and quick and amazing. I have about 15 of her DVDs and I'm never dissatisfied with any of them. U really will enjoy this. Buy the DVD and see for yourself. The pace is perfect for any age group.,1368316800,,311,4.473684210526316

2964195,4,B000WC38CS,I have been following Leslie's Walk Away The Pounds for years and really like the Walk Away Your Waistline! I like this video because it let's you stop at the different mile intervals and lets you take a water break. It also makes it easier if you were only planning on doing the first or second mile and not the whole dvd. I find her style of walking to be really effective in maintaining your weight plus it's gentle on your body. My only gripe is that the bands on the belt snap eaily. I've had to repurchase the belt a few times. Other than that this is a great form of exercise!,1362096000,,583,4.168141592920354

I alternate days between sculpting arms and working my waistline. I have lost an incredible amount of inches, firmed and toned in only a week. Probably the best and most favorite piece of equipment I own other than my collection of Leslie Sansone DVDs. The triceps move she uses during the workout has already helped with my underarm jiggle. I didn't think I could ever get rid of that. My core feels so much stronger. I am 5'3"" but feel so tall and fit. This has done in a  couple of weeks what months of yoga did not do. I have renewed confidence and self esteem. Thank you Leslie.",1361318400,4,751,4.326241134751773
2964208,5,B000WC38CS,"I love Leslie's DVDs and this one is no exception! This is a strong 3 miles with the walk belt but can be done without it.
I love the walk belt. I feel like it gives me that extra umph. Not to mention it has given me a little bicep I enjoy flaunting a tad.
I have lost 3 inches from my waist by using this once or twice a week in place of my normal workout.

I love the cast. Women of every age and shape. Plus the crew makes mistakes. I know it seems silly but I like knowing that the cast is not a bunch of amped up perfect androids like other workout tapes. They are human, they sweat and miss a step just like every other human. Rather comforting. Just like some of her other DVDs she has a workout meter to tell you when you have done one mile, two miles, and three miles. That makes it easy to pick and choose how far you want to go. If you need a mini workout then do a mile and then skip to the cool down.
The only downside FOR ME is how much Leslie talks in this one. I love watching her interact with the cast and talk but she gets rather silly this time. To the point it is almost annoying.
Regardless it is a good work and a must for any walk-at-home collections.",1360886400,,1175,3.8958333333333335

In many other DVDs, Leslie uses exercises which work the waistline without any props.  The belt isn't even used that much in the DVD.  I like it because it's a little different and it's good to use a variety of exercises.

2964219,5,B000WC38CS,"I HATE working out, and i mean HATE it. BUT there is something so effortless and yet effective about Leslie Sansone's workout videos. I always try different things because i get bored and one day i came across the Walk Away the Pounds videos and i find myself returning to them no matter what else i try. As a diabetic it's very important for me to work out and using the Walk Away the Pounds videos i've gotten back into shape after 2 back to back pregnancies that had me reeling from gestational diabetes. I found it hard to drop the baby weight after i had my youngest two kids and sure enough i ended up with full blown diabetes and was desperate for any help. of course the medication helped me shed 30lbs quickly, and eating a diabetic friendly diet too, but even after that i had at least 20lbs i wanted to lose. before i was diagnosed i was working out 3 times a day for an hour for 9months while breastfeeding even and never lost more than 5lbs. after the meds, and the diet i was really down on myself about the extra 20lbs i still needed to lose and some of the other workout videos i tried were just insane. i found myself completely worn out by the end of the day and with 4 kids and a busy schedule i just was crawling to my bed in the evenings. Once i started the Walk Away the Pounds videos i found that not only were they easy to follow, but they were fun and i still had tons of energy throughout the day. i do the video once a day, every day first thing in the morning and i'm ready to go the rest of the day. these videos helped me lose the 20lbs i wanted to lose and then something else happened....i saw tightness coming back to my tummy, legs, butt, and arms!! i loved this video in paticular w/the band. i love that you can use the band with any of her workout videos you just modify the moves to fit your own pace. it's really user friendly and versitle and ANYONE can use these videos. i loved it so much that i bought this set for my mother, who has plantar fasciitis and she has loved the video. this video workout isn't just for seniors as i've heard some people saying (around town), they are great for any age, any lifestyle, any person. i've recommened this workout video to so many people and i think it's wonderful that someone like me, someone that HATES working out can say that they truly love this work out video!",1352160000,3,2351,4.19205298013245

Glad that this one includes the walk belt which really puts a blast in to the workout.  Like probably most of her workouts, this one is also based on the 4 basic moves, walking (obviously), side-steps, kicks & knee lifts.  In this workout she has 4 ladies doing it with her.  Personally I do not care for the chit-chat she engages in with them, especially when it distracts her and she stops certain move countdowns more than once.  Her talking to the other ladies also messes her up a couple of times when doing walking up & back.  While it's not necessary to keep pace with her, I prefer to do so because that way I know I'm getting my best workout/calorie burn.  The ""countdown meter"" is kind of useless because it only pops up after she's already told you that it's almost time for another mile marker.  All-in-all, it gets the job done, with just a few annoyances.",1344556800,,989,4.366120218579235

2964223,4,B000WC38CS,"I like Leslie Sansone's DVD.  She make low impact cardio fun.  I was recovering from a back injury when a friend introduced me to this.  It's great if you are a little older have an injury or are new to exercise.  If you are a P90 X person you have no need for this.  It will burn a few calories and make you feel great but I yet to ""walk away my waistline"".  We do this DVD as a group at work and I really enjoy it. While everyone else is hitting the vending machine and getting more coffee my exercise group does this instead.  We feel a lot better for it.

My only complaint and the reason I took away a star is the way she shamelessly plugs ""the belt""  that comes with the DVD.  While it is fun to use I don't think it adds anything to the work out that an ordinary pair of hand weight wouldn't do.  Don't worry if you don't have ""the belt"" it's a silly contraption. Just grab a couple of weights and you will get an even better workout.",1339718400,,941,3.978609625668449

I really hate the workout DVDs where everyone is 40+ in age. It just makes me feel kind of silly, being only 21. But I'll tell you that the feeling went away pretty freaking quickly after I began working up a sweat. This program is awesome! Screw Zumba fitness.

I am amazed how small modifications to familiar moves and using a belt instead of weights could add a little intensity. I'm happy with my purchase and it makes me want to get more of her workouts.

The fist part of mile 3 is still brisk and then the last part of it goes into a cool down. I love all of Leslie's workouts. Whether you are a beginner or advanced you will like this workout. At first I thought there was not enough use of the waist belt the first time I did this workout but the next day I could really feel it and once you learn the moves you can incorporate more of it as you desire too. I do recommend doing the full workout and not breaking it down to just a mile a day. These dvds are great for those days when I don't have time to hit the gym.

She has music that sounds like finger nails on a blackboard and a lot of giggles and useless conversation but most of all she has hand weight, resistance bands and a fitness band. Trouble is she doesn't do any real exercises with them she mostly holds them. If I added up the total time she uses her gizmos, there probably isn't 3 minutes use out of 3 hours of DVD. After watching the DVD a couple of times I turned off the sound and put on my mp3 player. You can do any of the exercises with a couple of 1 lb. and 2 lb. ankle weights. I did loose 15 lbs. with this video and the cheap ankle weights that I held or put on my legs (or both). If you want a low impact workout I recommend this DVD.

Heads up for those people who need to be encouraged during workouts, Leslie is nothing but encouraging throughout all of her workouts and I love her bubbly personality.  I have lost a lot of weight using Leslie's walking videos (along with changes in my diet) and I love the way she motivates during the videos.  This video is unique in that she really does focus on your waistline and you can tell a difference when you use the walkbelt.  I also don't feel pressure to use the walkbelt every time because she encourages you not to use the walkbelt every time in the video.  There is a water break in the video and I find it incredibly helpful to have that little break but to continue to walk too!

Leslie talks, smiles, and jokes throughout the entire DVD.  The other ladies in the DVD are ""real people"" like you and me, and the entire team really helps to keep me motivated because they are upbeat, smiling, and energetic.

2964241,5,B000WC38CS,"I own two of the earlier Leslie Sansone walking DVDs (the one and two mile and the three mile) where she uses the weighted balls.  I wanted to graduate to another level and was intrigued by the addition of the belt to focus on the waistline.

This DVD is much more updated than her earlier ones and, in my opinion, a much better work out (though I still use the old ones--I like to mix it up).  I guarantee that, even if you are fit, you will be perspiring by the end of the workout--have a towel and water close by.  It's so entertaining and varied, though; it's amazing how quickly the time seems to go.  There are four basic steps but she does embellish that from time to time which helps vary the workout.

As is usual with her workouts, you have the option to do the workout with or without the belt (which is included) or do just one or two miles of the full workout.

There is a warm-up, cool down and stretching session.  It speeds up to 5 mph at its fastest, with an average of 4 mph (45 minutes long for the full workout).

This DVD is fun, has a great tempo (think salsa dance) and Leslie is both inspiring and funny.  Even though I've heard it countless times, I still smile at her remarks.

I had been dieting for some time and had hit a plateau in my weight loss.  Since adding this workout to my regimen, I am losing weight (and have dropped sizes) again--it is a great calorie burner.",1308182400,5,1400,4.202247191011236

So slowly building up with her various miles helped me to do a 5k. Now this one with the band had me pretty skeptical. I use free weights up to 5 lbs so I thought this would be nothing. Well the tension was enough on the bands to give a workout you can feel! If you concentrate on tucking your abs you will feel them after the workout as well. The only thing I would say negatively about this workout is Leslie gets too chatty with one of the background walkers at the end of the 3rd mile and not only could I not understand what they were saying, it was rather annoying trying to catch what she was saying.

2964245,5,B000WC38CS,"This was my first video of hers and I enjoy working out to it.  I work out all my life and consider myself advanced but this video is great for an easy workout on a busy or at the end of a work day.  I still use other videos such as the Firm or Gilad but these exercises sometimes can be difficult to begin at the end of a long day.  Leslie Sansone's workouts are easier to get into at the end of a hard day and also are easier on the joints.  It can be alternate with other types of workout to help you stay fit.  Furthermore, I can work out to this late in the evening and still go to sleep easily.  Other types of video can pump up the metabolisms very high and keep you awake late at night.  Leslie's walk still makes you sweat and you can choose to walk from 1 to 5 mile.  However, after you start, the endorphines will kick in and you will want to continue walking longer.  The music is this video is good and she walks with other normal people who are not fitness professionals.  Her talking keeps you going (sometimes too much but she is very friendly and motivating) and I also like her water break in the middle of the walk. Anyone can use her video (easy for beginners and still a good alternate workout for veterans).  The steps and routines are easy to follow.  The belt in this video will add some resistance and help tone up muscle.  The walk inside the home is also great when the weather gets too hot or too cold.  I recommend it.",1300060800,,1447,4.103202846975089
2964246,5,B000WC38CS,I am very happy with this video.  The belt really adds to the exercise and I have lost inches and pounds since I started using this product.,1299110400,,140,4.185185185185185
2964247,4,B000WC38CS,"I like the workout, but find the belt a bit cumbersome.  I must have short arms, because I find the bands too long to be very strenuous and it doesn't look like they are adjustable.  It is a good workout, but not my favorite (I have 7 or 8 of Leslie's DVD's)",1299024000,,258,3.9423076923076925
2964248,5,B000WC38CS,"I bought this video just recently and it is one of Leslie's better workouts. It comes with a workout belt meant to increase the intensity of the workout and exercise the arms. The belt does increase the intensity a bit and adds variety to the workout. It comes as adjustable so anyone can wear it. It is plastic and so, is good for light action.

What I really liked about this workout was that the transitions to different steps and different sections was smooth and continuous, some walking, then a new step right away.  Leslie still has fun in this workout, talking and laughing, but seems more in tune with the steps. I also liked the music in the workout. The arm exercises with the belt are used at intervals throughout the video and the slowdown walk starts early in the third mile. There are also new people in the workout, which I also enjoyed.

Leslie introduces the basic steps at the beginning of the workout, then uses those, some kickbacks, and walking sidesteps to add variety.  I liked that the walking and other steps got about equal time in this video. In other videos, Leslie will keep going with just one step while she talks; she forgets to change steps while she is talking.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-Walk-Away-Your-Waistline/dp/B000WC38CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Away Your Waistline!</a>",1298937600,2,1425,5.292035398230088
2964249,5,B000WC38CS,I have almost all of Leslie's DVDs and this one is among my most fav ones. The 3 mile walk is brisk and the belt is a great addition. I also have a couple of her interval training DVDs and they rock! She is an upbeat trainer and her moves are safe and easy - yet they burn tons of calories..so you don't waste time trying to learn the moves..instead you just start the exercise and have fun. I have gym membership but I prefer these DVDs over a gym anytime. Love her DVDs !!,1298937600,,474,4.0
2964250,5,B000WC38CS,"I put the belt on and started my new Leslie workout!  At first, I was thinking this belt was not going to make much of a difference.  I usually do four miles of walking with one of her other dvd's...by the end, I was glad GLAD that it was only three miles.  The belt makes a huge difference...whew...I am one tired girl!  I feel it even now...thirty minutes after the workout!  I just had to come in here and leave a review...because, I love this belt!  Woo HOO, Leslie!  Thanks",1298505600,3,478,4.2444444444444445
2964251,5,B000WC38CS,"At first I thought I was going to have to take several inches off the walk belt's latex bungies.  The belt's stretchable cables just seemed to easy.  By the time I was finished, I was quite happy that I resisted the temptation to fiddle with the equipment.  What seemed lacking in resistance in the first few minutes, became a fine level mid-way through the first mile.  At some later point, I am sure that I will need to MacGyver the bands a bit, but the muscles aren't quite there yet.

The walk belt is quite a bit too big for me (one size fits all) but that can be easily modified with a decent;y sharp pair of scissors.",1298160000,,624,4.254237288135593

I have increased my activity by 3 miles, who would have thought it.  The DVD is very motivating, I shut my room
door pop in the DVD and walk up a sweat.  Anyone, any age can definitely appreciate this work-out.
Leslie and her crew are very entertaining and sweat right along with you.  My main goal is to lose weight and
firm up in the process with this DVD it's a done deal.. Look out SUMMER  I'ma comin..Looking forward to purchasing more of her DVD's.",1297728000,,568,4.18348623853211
2964253,3,B000WC38CS,"I have several Leslie Sanesone walking workouts, and this one is better than some but not great. The belt and bands were too loose for me, so after a few times I finally tied a knot in the band and it helped. But really I don't feel like she uses the bands enough. She has you tuck the handles into the belt, which makes it uncomfortable to do knee lifts. Then when you pull the bands out again, the belt is loose.

It is a good workout, I do get winded and sweaty, but I don't feel like it uses the bands enough to tone my arms. :-/",1295740800,,533,3.935185185185185
2964254,5,B000WC38CS,Just started this video today.  Was thinking about returning the tape because I was too depressed to start an excercise program.  I am 56 years old and 50 lbs overweight.  I have been suffering from major depressive and bipolar disorder for years and I know that excercise is a great medicine for depression.  I was amazed that I was able to finish the entire 3 miles. It went by so quick! Since I am also somewhat agoraphobic I was impressed I was able to start a walking program in the privacy of my own home. I can't wait till tomorrow for another 3 miles.  The belt was too much for me since I just started.  I will incorporate the belt as I go.  I like Leslie's encouragement throughout the tape and found her chatter as down to earth. I live in a 700 sq. ft apartment with little room for traditional excercises.  Was able to keep up and do all movements.  Thank you Leslie.,1295395200,5,880,4.317073170731708
2964255,5,B000WC38CS,"Tried this for the first time today and I loved it!  I was surprised, however, how little the arm bands were used.  Her voice is going to take some getting used to.  She sounds a bit like a cross between Sarah Palin (which, IMO, is not a good thing) and a Jersey girl (which is!).

Don't be fooled that this is some easy, walk around your living room workout.  It gets your heart rate up and is fun!",1294358400,,399,4.064102564102564
2964256,5,B000WC38CS,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND IT IS GREAT
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT",1294185600,,103,3.727272727272727
2964257,5,B000WC38CS,"Who would have believed it!  Fourteen weeks ago I joined Weight Watchers at work and lost about 15 pounds and know it would be more if I had incorporated exercise which I really dislike.  So it was my fault.  I did go up and down my basement stairs during commercials and hop on this mini stepper but that got boring after a while.  The most that I did is walk for 15 minutes with a friend at work during warm weather.  Well, it being Michigan, I will not go outside if there is the slightest chill in the air.  So basically, September through March, I do not venture out unless I have to shovel snow.

I signed up for another WW session this week and knew that if I wanted to reach my weight loss goals I needed to exercise.  Talk about dread!  So while walking around in SAMS Club saw this and on impulse, purchased it.  As the lady rung this up I rolled my eyeballs thinking...why!  I'll hate it!  I just knew that I would try it, endure it for a while and it will end up being returned or buried in my forgotten DVD drawer.

So I get home and got ready to be disappointed.  NOT!  Immediately after you push play you are walking in place and she starts adding other elements to you walking in place like side steps, leg lifts, back kicks, then always back to just walking in place.  Soon your arms are pumping and you are going quicker, gaining momentum.  Add the waist band and you work on the upper body which is a plus.  It was so easy to follow!  The pace is what get you sweating and heart going but it wasn't overwhelming and you don't feel obligated to follow her perfectly.

I did the whole three miles that first time and LOVED IT!  It truly was a miracle!  I pushed myself that first time when I shouldn't have and was sweating, puffing air, but still LOVED IT!  And Leslie says that you never finish a workout and say you wished you didn't do it.  How true!  I felt great finishing this one!  I think I was more amazed that I couldn't wait to do it again.  Next day I did two miles.  Next day three.  Next day back to work, got home, did three miles and still wanted to do more!  I am still geeked about this!  I wish I could do it at work during my lunch hour! I rather EXERCISE than eat!  I AM JUST SO ASTONISHED that I can actually say...I can't wait to exercise!

I am 43 years old and own a tiny little house.  I do not have much room which this routine addresses.  I don't mind the waist band but prefer to use my 2 lb dumbells.  I like that I do not need to perfectly follow the routine.  Leslie stresses that it is the ""keep moving"" part that is important.  Even if you only do 1 mile a day (15 minutes), you are doing so much for your body and health.  You will be surprised how quickly the 3 miles goes by (45 minutes).  I am always proud of my sweat and after do the whole 3 miles I turn off the DVD, turn on the TV and do another mile on my own.

I like the fact also that she doesn't use perfect models and she isn't perfect.  Real people and real friendly and encouraging instructor.  I am excited about all these reviews and the positive results people are getting.  I order her Ultimate collection on Amazon and can't wait to get it.  I am even thinking about going out to buy myself a work out suit and new walking shoes...just unbelievable!  So I am really curious on how I will do with this next WW session WITH EXERCISE!  I will try to remember to come back and update this review to let you know how I did.

Any age would enjoy this routine!  I highly recommend this product!

UPDATE 03/2011:  Wow!  What a difference.  For the first month I exercised almost every day and then after started to alternate days or do it 3-4 times a week.  I did purchase more of her advance walking DVDs where you do ""Boosted Walking"" which is really low impact jogging - for two minutes each mile and found that I want to jog in place longer.  I really recommend you get more of her DVDs to change it up from time to time.  So here is what I have noticed.

I lost so many inches!  At the end of my first WW session I fit into a size 16 pants.  Now I fit into a size 12!  My butt is toning up because I do extra of the moves that seem to concentrate in that area (leg lifts and back kicks).  Lost an additional 11 pounds (for 27 total).  I don't have to do as much exercise because my metabolism has been built up to the point that missing a day is good and actually equalizes my body to help it keep losing.

People at work are seeing the difference and joining WW and borrowing this DVD.  It is so nice to be an inspiration.  Forget the expensive gym.  Stay at home!

I am proud to report, that since starting this exercise ""Walking at Home""  I have not gained at all which is amazing since some weeks I didn't do very well in the eating area.  I am single and eat out a lot!  But now, my body is processing the food so much more efficiently.  I still have 5 weeks left on this WW session and will report back later.  In summary...looking soooooo good and feeling it too!

UPDATE 05/01/2012:  I met my goal of 40 lbs back in Oct 2011 and have maintained my weight loss.  I signed up for WW Online just to keep on track.  I slacked off on doing the DVDs but that is going to change.  I just found out that the city that I live has been officially named the WORSE place for a single woman to walk NATIONWIDE!  So rather than take the big bat and pepper spray, I am just going to get back to Leslie.  She is still the best!

UPDATE 05/14/2013: Well, I have been on a forced vacation for a few months now and gained some weight back and have had some problems with my knees. Back to Leslie but I am not using the DVDs. I can now do it without the DVDs because it is so easily done. I add my own devised moves to change it up a bit. My weight is coming down again and I am feeling great.",1294099200,54,5801,4.059239610963749

Leslie works the entire body and is much more active during the entire workout.  I was doing the 3 mile workout on the VHS set, but was only able to barely finish the 2 mile DVD.  The belt with this set is also much improved over the belt that came with the VHS set -- it's stronger and therefore a better workout for the upper body.

I would highly recommend this product, and the price was great!!!",1278288000,,545,4.065420560747664

I have a healthy diet; but my job is mainly computer, sedentary work.  I was doing the walk video during my breaks.  Since I have been using the belt along w/the video, it has stepped up my workout and metabolism.  The only problem that I have had is that the belt is quite large and the bands didn't give me enough resistance so I replaced them.

2964266,5,B000WC38CS,"My main concern with other exercise videos is that they make them too complicated.  I am a busy student with a one-year old son.  Frankly, it is not relaxing or exciting for me to have to learn a bunch of new moves to exercise.  I have tried tai-bo, belly dancing, and other dance exercise videos and they must be good for those with better coordination, but not me.

That's why I love Leslie Sansone's videos.  She is so upbeat, happy and all through the video she gives you tips on how to increase or decrease the level of intensity so that really, this video can be for anyone at nearly any level of fitness.  My very active and fit husband tried to jump in and do the video with me at the two mile mark and found he could not keep up!  She really does get results for you and in such an easy, user-friendly way that several times I was so disappointed when the video was over that I replayed it and did another 3 miles with her!",1268870400,3,932,4.173184357541899

It is a heavy duty workout and the Walk Belt helps pump up the intensity of the walk. One thing I didn't like was that even though you can walk 1, 2 or 3 miles, you would have to stop in the middle of the workout at the mile markers. I like my earlier set that has separate workouts for 1, 2, and 3 miles with a warm up and cool down for each one. That way you do not just stop abruptly at 2 miles without gradually reducing the intensity. Otherwise, it's a great workout if you are up to 3 miles!",1267747200,,611,4.0578512396694215

I also liked that you get to choose if you want to do 1, mile, 2 miles or 3 miles. Although you don't get to use the be;t much in the first mile. If you want to really use the belt then I suggest you do at least 2 miles.

All of Leslie's workouts are great and I love the fact that she encourages everyone, no matter what shape they're in.  She explains that you can alter the intensity level and the main thing is to just keep walking.

Leslie is a talker and sometimes we do more reps than intended because she can't stop talking.  I find it humorous, others may find it annoying.

I was given Wii and Wii Fit for Christmas.  I thought Wii Fit would be my new exercise, but after a week or so, I was back to Leslie.  Wii Fit is not a substitute for 'real' exercise, and Leslie's DVD's are REAL exercise.  You will sweat, guaranteed!

In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great.

One thing I'd add about this program is that it is more than walking in place for three miles. You do simple moves - I'd call them like basic calisthenics - side steps and kicks - that keep it fun and work different muscles. That was a surprise to me and a good one.

Hope you enjoy this tape too. I'd definitely buy more of Leslie's stuff. Oh, and it helps that her ""helpers"" in the video are maybe 35-45+. Much more fun (for me as a middle aged woman anyway) than working out with some 20-somethings.",1262476800,,734,4.235714285714286
2964298,3,B000WC38CS,"Leslie Sansone is a woman who has profited greatly from simplicity. This walking workout has all the basic walking steps you will recognize from her other workouts but this time she uses a ""walk belt"" to tone the arms. The place I felt this workout the most was in my hips and abs. The only thing I'd recommend is that you make sure you have the walking belt on tight so it doesn't slip around or go up over your ribs when you lift your arms. Leslie uses the belt in other workouts so it is worth buying in this set. I think once you start doing this workout you will want to go for all three miles. You do of course have the option of only doing one or two miles. I'd recommend this to anyone who has been exercising for a couple of years. The pace is fairly fast and there are a lot of arm movements.

Leslie does a good job mixing up the moves, while nothing is very difficult I am tired and feel great afterward. I can tell I have excercised and the 3 miles is just the right leanth.

I suffer(yes..suffer) with fibromyalgia and can't do anything to harsh to kill myself! :) and this is fine so far, I just walk nice and easy and my heart rate rises and I don't feel like I can't do it.

This is the first Walk at Home program I've tried and I actually feel like I'm doing something great for my body. Your heart rate gets going, you break into a sweat, and you need plenty of water after doing this Walk at Home program. Other reviewers mentioned that Leslie chats or laughs too much but I think it's great because it makes her seem like a regular person; plus, she also gets sweaty and needs to take a water break, which really makes her look less like an intimidating workout instructor. Yes, there were at least two times where she lost track of counting but c'mon, it won't hurt you to do three more reps of knee lifts, will it?

I can't wait to do this routine more; the 3 miles go by really fast and you feel encouraged to keep up your hard work. Highly recommended, especially because it comes with that neat band!",1248134400,6,959,4.211956521739131

It's the workout I am looking for, not great tunes and this one fits the bill!

I love using it.  I'm not the skinniest of women & this belt fits around my waist just fine & it does remind me to keep my abs in while I'm working out.  This DVD does have a black background with the walkers, but that had no significance on me.  It was a good price for a great DVD, plus the walk band.  I just love Leslie's workouts.

But, I enjoy the workout though without the belt.  I just use my hand weights instead or you can even go without using anything.  I love her workouts!
The only other thing is that it doesn't stop after each mile.  It keeps going without any cool downs or stretches so you have the choice to keep going all the way to 3 miles.  I have the original Walk Away The Pounds dvd's and I like how they split them up into separate miles and with separate cool downs and stretches.

Many of the hotels I stay in don't have decent fitness centers, or the fitness room isn't open when I finally have time to exercise after my shows late at night. Walking outside is often not an option in the dangerous and/or unfamiliar neighborhoods where the hotels are. This dvd is the perfect solution for me! At least, the concept is. I loved it the first two times through.  I liked her friendliness, positive attitude, and the fact that she included her girlfriends in the video. But her high pitched voice soon becomes grating -- too annoying to listen to.  And the canned music is awful!!  So I just turn the volume off and play music of my own choice while I walk along with them.  Now I often just do the routine on my own completely, without the dvd at all.  It was a great motivator, though, and I'm glad I bought the dvd. The belt is a good concept, but the elastic is too loose to give me much resistance.  When I'm at home, I skip the belt and use hand weights instead.",1241827200,2,1033,4.321243523316062

When this came I thought I would give it a try, but since I go to the gym and take cardio classes often I wasn't sure if I would get a hard workout from this. I have to say I ended up loving this dvd! This dvd is great for all levels, since you can customize the movements and use the band more often than the girls on the dvd do if you want a little extra or you can not use it at all. I'd recommend this for people of all fitness levels whether you are an avid gym goer and want to add a little something extra to your daily workout or someone who is just beginning or trying to get back into exercise.

We feel terrific have lost weight and toned up- and generally the best thing that has ever happened to us- exercise wise!. The tape that we work out with was made in 2001- this one is much newer- Its nice - but a little to fast for us. She divides the walk into 3 different 1 mile walks on this one and hence its faster with stronger more vigorous miles, for those who want a good 15 minute(1 mile) workout) We always go three miles on the old one(45 minutes). I can't say enough about how good Leslie Sansones dvds are!

*Like that it's 3 miles--so it can be a short day for me.
*Like using the walk belt. it's more comfortable than i expected too.
*Like Leslie and her upbeat personality

*Don't like that mile 3 is too low in intensity. it's like all of mile 3 is cool down. I want 3 intense miles and then a cool down. So, mile 3 is a big disappointment.
*Don't like that she hardly uses the belt. I was really looking forward to more resistance work and whe barely had us use the belt. Could have incorporated it better.
*Didn't care for the interaction b/n cast, espec the whole water and towel bit. They should have stopped taping or done it more than once and edited it better. I don't mind Leslie's chatter but this aspect was annoying.

I have not had a problem with the walk belt, as long as you have it on tight enough.

I liked this one so much I ordered 2 more.  I just did the 5 mile for the first time today and it is also a fantastic workout.

Oftentimes, she talks so much it can get annoying after you've heard it a few times - my sister and I have a lot of the things she says memorized! On this particular DVD, I do like the belt, and feel like it does help with working my arms more during the walking, which I think is great. I also do think it helps with me with my abs too, because I can tell the difference even when I just put it on. So for that, I do think this was a good purchase. However...I do find that Leslie really gets on my nerves in this one. Personally, I prefer the videos where she is by herself, but there are four others in this one with her. I just don't really like how she interacts with them - to me, it's very distracting. Obviously, it is for her too, considering how many times she seems to lose count or forget what she's supposed to be doing! Like I said, she does this in some of the other videos as well, but this one was worse. If it weren't for that, I would rate it much higher, because I do like the actual workout; I just could have done without all the chit-chat!",1239321600,17,1139,4.066666666666666

This video is great because the mile counter on the bottom of the screen lets you choose what type of workout you feel like doing.  Some days I only do 1, but most of the time I stop at 2 or 3.

The resistance band is also a great feature to this workout.  But, as Leslie tells us, it is a good workout without it too!  Some days my arms are too sore to use it, so I do the video without it.  I still feel great after working out and will continue to use her Dvd's and purchase more.  I have lost 40lbs watching my food intake and using Leslie's WATP's!

I have also recently gotten my 70 year old Mother to start using these workouts.  She loves the easy, gently 1 mile workout and has started doing these every morning!

2964474,5,B000WC38CS,"I made a committment this year to get fit. I decided to use Leslie Sansone workouts along with neighborhood walks. The Walk Away Your Waistline gives you an incredible workout. I can see a difference after a few short weeks. In fact, I am walking less in my neighborhood and making this and her other exercise routines apart of my daily activity. If you workout consisently with this program, you will see results. I agree with the other reviewers that you may have to work up to the three miles. It took me two times before I could get through the three miles. I am still striving to be able to complete the three miles with full intensity for the third mile. I use a heart rate monitor and this program keeps my heart rate at a high-calorie burn level. The toning and firming is something I can't get easily walking around my neighborhood. Get this dvd.

2964496,5,B000WC38CS,"I like this workout because I don't have to be super coordinated in order to do it - and as it states, it's a very good workout in just 45 short minutes.  Leslie's constant ""chatter"" gets a little annoying sometimes, but you can't help but enjoy the friendship that seems to exist between her and the other ladies.  And one of my favorite parts of this - those other ladies are mostly middle-aged or older, and don't look like young, sculpted beach babes.  These women are women just like me (except a little more fit) so that I feel like ""hey - I can do this"" instead of thinking ""good grief - I'll never look like THAT!""",1236816000,,622,4.299145299145299

I started walking in the evenings to help my restless legs and this has really helped. It took me almost a week to be able to do the 3 miles but now it feels so good. I don't really notice a difference wearing the walk belt. There's a nice warm up and cool down which is great. I would recommend this to any walker, even those new to Leslie. I love how she is so upbeat and encouraging. I'm hooked and have to walk every night.",1235692800,,543,4.08411214953271
2964498,5,B000WC38CS,"I am a recent but BIG fan of Leslie Sansone. A few weeks ago, I discovered one of her 2-mile programs on my Exercise on Demand Cable channel. I am the proud survivor of two open-heart surgeries, and I'm always looking for a workout that I can keep up with. After doing that for only a few days, I just loved it. I was already firming up and losing weight, combined with eating well.

To ""kick it up a notch"" I decided to buy Walk Away Your Waistline. I tried it today for the first time and I feel fantastic. Some might think it's a bit too brisk for them after watching it. Please don't be intimidated! One of the wonderful things about Leslie is that she just encourages you to stay in motion and do things at your own pace.

The music on this DVD is perfect and really keeps you moving. Leslie Sansone is a very engaging, encouraging, and intelligent instructor. This really is a workout for everybody. You can do it! And you'll be so surprised and proud how quickly even a mile goes.

This DVD comes with her workout belt. If you've not been working out for a while, I'd suggest doing it without the belt for a while. As Leslie promises, you'll still get a fantastic workout. I did it without it, and I was sweating like heck! The moves are not too complicated, the pace is just right (even for a Cardiac patient), and you'll just feel fantastic after you're done.",1235520000,2,1368,4.315175097276264

Great workout.  Really is a good workout on the legs.  I agree with pretty much all the other reviews.  She does at least 3 basic steps besides just walking:  side steps, knee lifts, kick backs, incuding  variations.

2964528,5,B000WC38CS,Leslie takes it up a notch in the video.  I love the walk belt because you can feel the difference when you use it during the workout.  She turns it up enough to break a sweat within the first mile.  One of her best workouts.,1233619200,,225,3.9555555555555557

I enjoy her structured pace and how she keeps the workout upbeat and before you know it the miles have past quickly. I would recommend these videos to both men and women who want to lose weight and have fun while doing it. Each video adds new and different moves and you never get bored.
Ordering from Amazon is easy and reliable. I have ordered from them for years and will continue to do so.  Amazon makes it easy to get whatever you need fast and you never have to worry if this site is secure.",1233532800,,647,4.217741935483871

You wouldn't think you've just worked out for 45 minutes and walked 3 miles! If you're not comfortable with doing all three, trust me and start out with the 1 mile marker and work your way on up. I use this DVD at least 3 days a week,and the walking belt included is helping to tone my muscles and slim my waistline. Don't worry about not being able to follow, she makes every mile easy to follow along.
Since it is a little colder right now, I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking to work up a good sweat!",1233187200,,686,4.088888888888889

As far as the workout I think it's good.  Definitely more than just walking, it's walking and a good exercise. The first time I did it around 9pm and couldn't fall asleep.

2964547,5,B000WC38CS,"I am really not a fan of exercise DVDs but a friend who has been using multiple forms of exercise to achieve her fitness goals recommended Leslie Sansome's DVDs to me. I have found this one to be amazingly valuable. I picked it because it has a focus on trimming the waistline (my most problem area) but it is a good aerobic workout too. You can adjust the intensity to suit you by making the movements larger or smaller according to your own fitness level. You can also do only 1 or 2 miles (15 min. each) if you do not have time for the full DVD which is only 45 minutes. When I opened the package I thought the resistance bands attached to the waist belt were wimpy but they are just right when you are doing arm exercises while walking aerobically! The belt also keeps you focused on tightening those abs during the workout. I am using the DVD several times a week and have not gotten bored with it. One last point to mention is that there are ""real"" women in the DVD doing the workout not models.",1231632000,2,1001,4.2460732984293195

2964549,5,B000WC38CS,"I bought this last summer and didn't even open the box until my New Year resolution.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I have tried a lot of different exercise workouts and for a 51 yr old non-exerciser, most included too much fancy foot work or jumping around.  This workout is great!  I started out with the first 15 minute mile and completed the entire 3 miles the first time.  This isn't about fancy footwork or jumping around.  It's about getting up and moving.  It's so simple to follow and by using your arms, you get just enough of a workout.  I discovered that by holding 1 lb weights during the routine, I could boost it up a bit.  I was so impressed with this workout, that I've been using it every morning for 15 minutes before work and the entire workout on the weekend.  This is my first Leslie Sansone workout and since then I've bought a few more, but this is one of my favorites of the bunch. I love how these are broken down into 15 minute segments. The waist belt is a great addition too.

This would be a great workout for someone who hasn't worked out in years, is very overweight or an older person because all you do is walk with a few small kicks, leg lifts and side steps.  If it's too much to use the arms, then just do the steps. The tempo of the music keeps you going.

On the negative side, Leslie's voice and laugh sort of gets on my nerves more so than in her other workouts but it's tolerable.",1230854400,6,1426,4.237037037037037

In fact I could feel more in my waistline area during other parts of the tape. I did like the workout. It is a good 3 mile workout but the belt is not used to its best advantage.

I usually go to the gym but I run short on time some days and thought this would be a good substitute to my cardio workout at the gym.  I like Leslie, she gives good advice about health and exercise in general and the workout is totally low impact for those of us with back and knee problems.  I get the most out of it with the walk belt.  It was challenging at first but after a few runs at it, I don't feel I break into that much of a sweat.  It does make for a good cardio workout when I am in a pinch.

I have to wake up at 4:30 a.m. as it is my only time to workout (with work and the baby) and there are some mornings that I just don't want to do it. On those mornings I really just think about what Leslie says to you during the workout ""You'll feel so much better"" ""You never say you wished you hadn't worked out"" etc... things like that get me out of bed and get me moving, and she's right. I have more energy, I feel stronger, and I am looking better already. I have dropped 5 pounds in one week (while eating right).

I have rediscovered her on ""On Demand"" TV and now I am hooked!  She is greatly improved and it is a fun workout.  What is the most important factor in an exercise program?  The ability to keep on doing it on a regular basis and for me, I feel this is it because:  1.  Easy to follow  2.  No jarring high impact moves  3.  No feeling of ""I can't keep up""  4.  Yet you feel like you had a great workout  5.  And very important, I enjoy the music.  I cannot overestimate the importance of that.  If I don't like the background music, it just ruins it for me.
If you are one of those that make it a career of weightlifting, harder and harder workouts, and torture, this is not for you.  If you want a workout you feel you can keep up with and even look forward to doing, this is the workout for you!",1218844800,8,935,4.071823204419889
2964686,3,B000WC38CS,"Have enjoyed using Leslie's workouts as variously shown on On Demand TV, so ordered one to own. It is a good workout, however I found it somewhat awkward to follow: I prefer to get into a rhythm and follow in time with her leg movements, and it kept skipping or having unexpected changes (usually when camera off her) that threw me off and were annoying to have to correct. The bigger disappointment though it that the stretches at the end stopped short of equal movements on each side.

So these are really many workouts that you can make yourself!  Leslie is so encouraging during the workout and very sincere (even if sometimes she seems a little corny).

Well after falling off the workout wagon for a few years, I decided to get back on and see if Leslie had added to her workout options. HAS SHE EVER! This is a GREAT workout for beginners and experts alike. The DVD format allows you to do one, two, or three miles (so beginners can start with one mile and then go straight to the cool down). And it's not so ""perfect."" Everyone sweats, they break for towels and water, and some of the girls even mess up from time to time, which makes me feel better when I mess up myself. :-) This is a great way to start the day, break a sweat, and feel you've accomplished something.

I have some older workouts with the belt, but this one is faster paced and I sweated!!!! It has the usual steps for those of us who are uncoordinated for the workouts with too many dance steps.

My only criticism is that during the stretching exercises after the workout, Leslie takes you through what she calls ""yoga inpired"" stretches on one side of the body, but when we switch to the other side, she doesn't repeat those stretches; she just ends after the hamstring stretch.  No worries . . . I repeat the ""yoga-inspired"" stretches while she's giggling with her ""Sisters in Sweat""!",1212796800,2,616,4.675925925925926

The combination of aerobics and strength training with the belt really gives you a complete workout. My exercise previous to this was a two to three mile walk in my neighborhood. This really kicks it up. I think first time exercisers will like the fact that you can start with one mile and then build up to the complete 3 miles. The last mile was easy once you are able to complete the two miles because the intensity lessens. What a bargain, too. Going to the gym requires more time and more money and this is just as good and you can do this whenever you want. I would highly recommend this product.",1211846400,4,689,4.3076923076923075

I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do the workouts because I've been sitting on the sofa for so long, but this is a workout anyone can do.  I live in Arizona and in the summer it's just too hot to go outside so this is ideal for me.

The workout is divided into 3 seperate miles so you have the choice in the amount of time you spend, if you are busy.  Also, she updates you along the way as to how far and how fast you have been walking.  She is a very peppy person (sometimes to the point of being irritating) but you can get past it.

Also, if you travel, it's easy to take a DVD with you and pop it in the DVD player and go. You can walk in place or move around based on your available space. It simple and easy, which makes these walking tapes a necessity and it works for all ages as you modify your workout to your needs. For example, you can use the waist belt or not--you can walk with weights, whatever your desire. You are empowered to do what you want on that day. You can stop the DVD wherever you want if your time is limited. You have the power to walk off as much weight as you want--which is fabulous!",1391817600,2,927,4.364161849710983

Each new series she creates incorporates all the newest information in exercise physiology and is just plain fun! I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to head to a gym, can't walk outdoors, and is just looking for a program that gets you moving without it being necessary to be a ""dancer"", an athlete, or in boot camp.

One of the reasons is that using a waistband during the exercise is very awkward.  The other reason is to be surrounded by some women and Leslie chatting to them during the video is a kind of annoying to me.  I 'd rather want to concentrate the exercise and have her talk only related to the exercise.

I've learned the basic steps, the rhythms that she uses during the video , and I can apply these movements through the first video ""walking at home 3 miles.""  It seems to me the rest of them are just duplicates to me.",1369267200,,636,4.214876033057851

Not impressed with the belt, don't feel much resistance, no more than I can get adding weights and I don't think its really used that much in the 3 mile workout included. I will definately do the miles but probarly skip the belt and use weights.",1364601600,,351,4.253731343283582

3198692,4,B000WC38CS,I have been following Leslie's Walk Away The Pounds for years and really like the Walk Away Your Waistline! I like this video because it let's you stop at the different mile intervals and lets you take a water break. It also makes it easier if you were only planning on doing the first or second mile and not the whole dvd. I find her style of walking to be really effective in maintaining your weight plus it's gentle on your body. My only gripe is that the bands on the belt snap eaily. I've had to repurchase the belt a few times. Other than that this is a great form of exercise!,1362096000,,583,4.168141592920354

3198694,5,B000WC38CS,"When I removed the belt from its box I thought I had wasted my money. Absolutely not!!! I felt results after the first use. It is great for my posture during workouts. I alternate days between sculpting arms and working my waistline. I have lost an incredible amount of inches, firmed and toned in only a week. Probably the best and most favorite piece of equipment I own other than my collection of Leslie Sansone DVDs. The triceps move she uses during the workout has already helped with my underarm jiggle. I didn't think I could ever get rid of that. My core feels so much stronger. I am 5'3"" but feel so tall and fit. This has done in a  couple of weeks what months of yoga did not do. I have renewed confidence and self esteem. Thank you Leslie.",1361318400,4,751,4.326241134751773
3198705,5,B000WC38CS,"I love Leslie's DVDs and this one is no exception! This is a strong 3 miles with the walk belt but can be done without it.
I love the walk belt. I feel like it gives me that extra umph. Not to mention it has given me a little bicep I enjoy flaunting a tad.
I have lost 3 inches from my waist by using this once or twice a week in place of my normal workout.

I love the cast. Women of every age and shape. Plus the crew makes mistakes. I know it seems silly but I like knowing that the cast is not a bunch of amped up perfect androids like other workout tapes. They are human, they sweat and miss a step just like every other human. Rather comforting. Just like some of her other DVDs she has a workout meter to tell you when you have done one mile, two miles, and three miles. That makes it easy to pick and choose how far you want to go. If you need a mini workout then do a mile and then skip to the cool down.
The only downside FOR ME is how much Leslie talks in this one. I love watching her interact with the cast and talk but she gets rather silly this time. To the point it is almost annoying.
Regardless it is a good work and a must for any walk-at-home collections.",1360886400,,1175,3.8958333333333335

3198711,4,B000WC38CS,"I love Leslie Sansone's DVDs and have enjoyed using this.  However, I have to say that you really don't need to use this waistline belt to work this area.  In many other DVDs, Leslie uses exercises which work the waistline without any props.  The belt isn't even used that much in the DVD.  I like it because it's a little different and it's good to use a variety of exercises.  But if you are new to Leslie Sansone, this is probably not the best one to buy.",1357948800,,458,4.218390804597701

3198716,5,B000WC38CS,"I HATE working out, and i mean HATE it. BUT there is something so effortless and yet effective about Leslie Sansone's workout videos. I always try different things because i get bored and one day i came across the Walk Away the Pounds videos and i find myself returning to them no matter what else i try. As a diabetic it's very important for me to work out and using the Walk Away the Pounds videos i've gotten back into shape after 2 back to back pregnancies that had me reeling from gestational diabetes. I found it hard to drop the baby weight after i had my youngest two kids and sure enough i ended up with full blown diabetes and was desperate for any help. of course the medication helped me shed 30lbs quickly, and eating a diabetic friendly diet too, but even after that i had at least 20lbs i wanted to lose. before i was diagnosed i was working out 3 times a day for an hour for 9months while breastfeeding even and never lost more than 5lbs. after the meds, and the diet i was really down on myself about the extra 20lbs i still needed to lose and some of the other workout videos i tried were just insane. i found myself completely worn out by the end of the day and with 4 kids and a busy schedule i just was crawling to my bed in the evenings. Once i started the Walk Away the Pounds videos i found that not only were they easy to follow, but they were fun and i still had tons of energy throughout the day. i do the video once a day, every day first thing in the morning and i'm ready to go the rest of the day. these videos helped me lose the 20lbs i wanted to lose and then something else happened....i saw tightness coming back to my tummy, legs, butt, and arms!! i loved this video in paticular w/the band. i love that you can use the band with any of her workout videos you just modify the moves to fit your own pace. it's really user friendly and versitle and ANYONE can use these videos. i loved it so much that i bought this set for my mother, who has plantar fasciitis and she has loved the video. this video workout isn't just for seniors as i've heard some people saying (around town), they are great for any age, any lifestyle, any person. i've recommened this workout video to so many people and i think it's wonderful that someone like me, someone that HATES working out can say that they truly love this work out video!",1352160000,3,2351,4.19205298013245

Glad that this one includes the walk belt which really puts a blast in to the workout.  Like probably most of her workouts, this one is also based on the 4 basic moves, walking (obviously), side-steps, kicks & knee lifts.  In this workout she has 4 ladies doing it with her.  Personally I do not care for the chit-chat she engages in with them, especially when it distracts her and she stops certain move countdowns more than once.  Her talking to the other ladies also messes her up a couple of times when doing walking up & back.  While it's not necessary to keep pace with her, I prefer to do so because that way I know I'm getting my best workout/calorie burn.  The ""countdown meter"" is kind of useless because it only pops up after she's already told you that it's almost time for another mile marker.  All-in-all, it gets the job done, with just a few annoyances.",1344556800,,989,4.366120218579235

3198720,4,B000WC38CS,"I like Leslie Sansone's DVD.  She make low impact cardio fun.  I was recovering from a back injury when a friend introduced me to this.  It's great if you are a little older have an injury or are new to exercise.  If you are a P90 X person you have no need for this.  It will burn a few calories and make you feel great but I yet to ""walk away my waistline"".  We do this DVD as a group at work and I really enjoy it. While everyone else is hitting the vending machine and getting more coffee my exercise group does this instead.  We feel a lot better for it.

My only complaint and the reason I took away a star is the way she shamelessly plugs ""the belt""  that comes with the DVD.  While it is fun to use I don't think it adds anything to the work out that an ordinary pair of hand weight wouldn't do.  Don't worry if you don't have ""the belt"" it's a silly contraption. Just grab a couple of weights and you will get an even better workout.",1339718400,,941,3.978609625668449

I really hate the workout DVDs where everyone is 40+ in age. It just makes me feel kind of silly, being only 21. But I'll tell you that the feeling went away pretty freaking quickly after I began working up a sweat. This program is awesome! Screw Zumba fitness.

I am amazed how small modifications to familiar moves and using a belt instead of weights could add a little intensity. I'm happy with my purchase and it makes me want to get more of her workouts.

The fist part of mile 3 is still brisk and then the last part of it goes into a cool down. I love all of Leslie's workouts. Whether you are a beginner or advanced you will like this workout. At first I thought there was not enough use of the waist belt the first time I did this workout but the next day I could really feel it and once you learn the moves you can incorporate more of it as you desire too. I do recommend doing the full workout and not breaking it down to just a mile a day. These dvds are great for those days when I don't have time to hit the gym.

But I got off track and stopped working out for awhile and then came back to it a year later and it was not easy! This dvd does include the cast of her friends and I don't mind all the chatting but Leslie does miss her cues and steps a few times due to her talking with the other walkers.

She has music that sounds like finger nails on a blackboard and a lot of giggles and useless conversation but most of all she has hand weight, resistance bands and a fitness band. Trouble is she doesn't do any real exercises with them she mostly holds them. If I added up the total time she uses her gizmos, there probably isn't 3 minutes use out of 3 hours of DVD. After watching the DVD a couple of times I turned off the sound and put on my mp3 player. You can do any of the exercises with a couple of 1 lb. and 2 lb. ankle weights. I did loose 15 lbs. with this video and the cheap ankle weights that I held or put on my legs (or both). If you want a low impact workout I recommend this DVD.

Heads up for those people who need to be encouraged during workouts, Leslie is nothing but encouraging throughout all of her workouts and I love her bubbly personality.  I have lost a lot of weight using Leslie's walking videos (along with changes in my diet) and I love the way she motivates during the videos.  This video is unique in that she really does focus on your waistline and you can tell a difference when you use the walkbelt.  I also don't feel pressure to use the walkbelt every time because she encourages you not to use the walkbelt every time in the video.  There is a water break in the video and I find it incredibly helpful to have that little break but to continue to walk too!

You can choose to do 1, 2, or 3 miles with or without the walk belt.  The belt definitely adds a lot to the exercising!  I use it every other day.

Leslie talks, smiles, and jokes throughout the entire DVD.  The other ladies in the DVD are ""real people"" like you and me, and the entire team really helps to keep me motivated because they are upbeat, smiling, and energetic.

It lasts 48 mins. but you can do less if you don't have as much time.  The waistbelt works really well and is easy to use.  It makes a difference!  I would recommend this to anyone who needs to get in their daily exercise, burn calories, and doesn't want to go to the gym to do it.  She includes sidesteps and kicks and arm exercised as well.

3198738,5,B000WC38CS,"I own two of the earlier Leslie Sansone walking DVDs (the one and two mile and the three mile) where she uses the weighted balls.  I wanted to graduate to another level and was intrigued by the addition of the belt to focus on the waistline.

This DVD is much more updated than her earlier ones and, in my opinion, a much better work out (though I still use the old ones--I like to mix it up).  I guarantee that, even if you are fit, you will be perspiring by the end of the workout--have a towel and water close by.  It's so entertaining and varied, though; it's amazing how quickly the time seems to go.  There are four basic steps but she does embellish that from time to time which helps vary the workout.

As is usual with her workouts, you have the option to do the workout with or without the belt (which is included) or do just one or two miles of the full workout.

There is a warm-up, cool down and stretching session.  It speeds up to 5 mph at its fastest, with an average of 4 mph (45 minutes long for the full workout).

This DVD is fun, has a great tempo (think salsa dance) and Leslie is both inspiring and funny.  Even though I've heard it countless times, I still smile at her remarks.

I had been dieting for some time and had hit a plateau in my weight loss.  Since adding this workout to my regimen, I am losing weight (and have dropped sizes) again--it is a great calorie burner.",1308182400,5,1400,4.202247191011236

So slowly building up with her various miles helped me to do a 5k. Now this one with the band had me pretty skeptical. I use free weights up to 5 lbs so I thought this would be nothing. Well the tension was enough on the bands to give a workout you can feel! If you concentrate on tucking your abs you will feel them after the workout as well. The only thing I would say negatively about this workout is Leslie gets too chatty with one of the background walkers at the end of the 3rd mile and not only could I not understand what they were saying, it was rather annoying trying to catch what she was saying.
Oh well other than that I highly recommend this one!",1302307200,4,818,4.1125

3198742,5,B000WC38CS,"This was my first video of hers and I enjoy working out to it.  I work out all my life and consider myself advanced but this video is great for an easy workout on a busy or at the end of a work day.  I still use other videos such as the Firm or Gilad but these exercises sometimes can be difficult to begin at the end of a long day.  Leslie Sansone's workouts are easier to get into at the end of a hard day and also are easier on the joints.  It can be alternate with other types of workout to help you stay fit.  Furthermore, I can work out to this late in the evening and still go to sleep easily.  Other types of video can pump up the metabolisms very high and keep you awake late at night.  Leslie's walk still makes you sweat and you can choose to walk from 1 to 5 mile.  However, after you start, the endorphines will kick in and you will want to continue walking longer.  The music is this video is good and she walks with other normal people who are not fitness professionals.  Her talking keeps you going (sometimes too much but she is very friendly and motivating) and I also like her water break in the middle of the walk. Anyone can use her video (easy for beginners and still a good alternate workout for veterans).  The steps and routines are easy to follow.  The belt in this video will add some resistance and help tone up muscle.  The walk inside the home is also great when the weather gets too hot or too cold.  I recommend it.",1300060800,,1447,4.103202846975089

3198744,4,B000WC38CS,"I like the workout, but find the belt a bit cumbersome.  I must have short arms, because I find the bands too long to be very strenuous and it doesn't look like they are adjustable.  It is a good workout, but not my favorite (I have 7 or 8 of Leslie's DVD's)",1299024000,,258,3.9423076923076925
3198745,5,B000WC38CS,"I bought this video just recently and it is one of Leslie's better workouts. It comes with a workout belt meant to increase the intensity of the workout and exercise the arms. The belt does increase the intensity a bit and adds variety to the workout. It comes as adjustable so anyone can wear it. It is plastic and so, is good for light action.

What I really liked about this workout was that the transitions to different steps and different sections was smooth and continuous, some walking, then a new step right away.  Leslie still has fun in this workout, talking and laughing, but seems more in tune with the steps. I also liked the music in the workout. The arm exercises with the belt are used at intervals throughout the video and the slowdown walk starts early in the third mile. There are also new people in the workout, which I also enjoyed.

Leslie introduces the basic steps at the beginning of the workout, then uses those, some kickbacks, and walking sidesteps to add variety.  I liked that the walking and other steps got about equal time in this video. In other videos, Leslie will keep going with just one step while she talks; she forgets to change steps while she is talking.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-Walk-Away-Your-Waistline/dp/B000WC38CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Away Your Waistline!</a>",1298937600,2,1425,5.292035398230088
3198746,5,B000WC38CS,I have almost all of Leslie's DVDs and this one is among my most fav ones. The 3 mile walk is brisk and the belt is a great addition. I also have a couple of her interval training DVDs and they rock! She is an upbeat trainer and her moves are safe and easy - yet they burn tons of calories..so you don't waste time trying to learn the moves..instead you just start the exercise and have fun. I have gym membership but I prefer these DVDs over a gym anytime. Love her DVDs !!,1298937600,,474,4.0
3198747,5,B000WC38CS,"I put the belt on and started my new Leslie workout!  At first, I was thinking this belt was not going to make much of a difference.  I usually do four miles of walking with one of her other dvd's...by the end, I was glad GLAD that it was only three miles.  The belt makes a huge difference...whew...I am one tired girl!  I feel it even now...thirty minutes after the workout!  I just had to come in here and leave a review...because, I love this belt!  Woo HOO, Leslie!  Thanks",1298505600,3,478,4.2444444444444445
3198748,5,B000WC38CS,"At first I thought I was going to have to take several inches off the walk belt's latex bungies.  The belt's stretchable cables just seemed to easy.  By the time I was finished, I was quite happy that I resisted the temptation to fiddle with the equipment.  What seemed lacking in resistance in the first few minutes, became a fine level mid-way through the first mile.  At some later point, I am sure that I will need to MacGyver the bands a bit, but the muscles aren't quite there yet.

The walk belt is quite a bit too big for me (one size fits all) but that can be easily modified with a decent;y sharp pair of scissors.",1298160000,,624,4.254237288135593

Leslie and her crew are very entertaining and sweat right along with you.  My main goal is to lose weight and
firm up in the process with this DVD it's a done deal.. Look out SUMMER  I'ma comin..Looking forward to purchasing more of her DVD's.",1297728000,,568,4.18348623853211
3198750,3,B000WC38CS,"I have several Leslie Sanesone walking workouts, and this one is better than some but not great. The belt and bands were too loose for me, so after a few times I finally tied a knot in the band and it helped. But really I don't feel like she uses the bands enough. She has you tuck the handles into the belt, which makes it uncomfortable to do knee lifts. Then when you pull the bands out again, the belt is loose.

It is a good workout, I do get winded and sweaty, but I don't feel like it uses the bands enough to tone my arms. :-/",1295740800,,533,3.935185185185185
3198751,5,B000WC38CS,Just started this video today.  Was thinking about returning the tape because I was too depressed to start an excercise program.  I am 56 years old and 50 lbs overweight.  I have been suffering from major depressive and bipolar disorder for years and I know that excercise is a great medicine for depression.  I was amazed that I was able to finish the entire 3 miles. It went by so quick! Since I am also somewhat agoraphobic I was impressed I was able to start a walking program in the privacy of my own home. I can't wait till tomorrow for another 3 miles.  The belt was too much for me since I just started.  I will incorporate the belt as I go.  I like Leslie's encouragement throughout the tape and found her chatter as down to earth. I live in a 700 sq. ft apartment with little room for traditional excercises.  Was able to keep up and do all movements.  Thank you Leslie.,1295395200,5,880,4.317073170731708
3198752,5,B000WC38CS,"Tried this for the first time today and I loved it!  I was surprised, however, how little the arm bands were used.  Her voice is going to take some getting used to.  She sounds a bit like a cross between Sarah Palin (which, IMO, is not a good thing) and a Jersey girl (which is!).

Don't be fooled that this is some easy, walk around your living room workout.  It gets your heart rate up and is fun!",1294358400,,399,4.064102564102564
3198753,5,B000WC38CS,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND IT IS GREAT
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT",1294185600,,103,3.727272727272727
3198754,5,B000WC38CS,"Who would have believed it!  Fourteen weeks ago I joined Weight Watchers at work and lost about 15 pounds and know it would be more if I had incorporated exercise which I really dislike.  So it was my fault.  I did go up and down my basement stairs during commercials and hop on this mini stepper but that got boring after a while.  The most that I did is walk for 15 minutes with a friend at work during warm weather.  Well, it being Michigan, I will not go outside if there is the slightest chill in the air.  So basically, September through March, I do not venture out unless I have to shovel snow.

I signed up for another WW session this week and knew that if I wanted to reach my weight loss goals I needed to exercise.  Talk about dread!  So while walking around in SAMS Club saw this and on impulse, purchased it.  As the lady rung this up I rolled my eyeballs thinking...why!  I'll hate it!  I just knew that I would try it, endure it for a while and it will end up being returned or buried in my forgotten DVD drawer.

So I get home and got ready to be disappointed.  NOT!  Immediately after you push play you are walking in place and she starts adding other elements to you walking in place like side steps, leg lifts, back kicks, then always back to just walking in place.  Soon your arms are pumping and you are going quicker, gaining momentum.  Add the waist band and you work on the upper body which is a plus.  It was so easy to follow!  The pace is what get you sweating and heart going but it wasn't overwhelming and you don't feel obligated to follow her perfectly.

I did the whole three miles that first time and LOVED IT!  It truly was a miracle!  I pushed myself that first time when I shouldn't have and was sweating, puffing air, but still LOVED IT!  And Leslie says that you never finish a workout and say you wished you didn't do it.  How true!  I felt great finishing this one!  I think I was more amazed that I couldn't wait to do it again.  Next day I did two miles.  Next day three.  Next day back to work, got home, did three miles and still wanted to do more!  I am still geeked about this!  I wish I could do it at work during my lunch hour! I rather EXERCISE than eat!  I AM JUST SO ASTONISHED that I can actually say...I can't wait to exercise!

I am 43 years old and own a tiny little house.  I do not have much room which this routine addresses.  I don't mind the waist band but prefer to use my 2 lb dumbells.  I like that I do not need to perfectly follow the routine.  Leslie stresses that it is the ""keep moving"" part that is important.  Even if you only do 1 mile a day (15 minutes), you are doing so much for your body and health.  You will be surprised how quickly the 3 miles goes by (45 minutes).  I am always proud of my sweat and after do the whole 3 miles I turn off the DVD, turn on the TV and do another mile on my own.

I like the fact also that she doesn't use perfect models and she isn't perfect.  Real people and real friendly and encouraging instructor.  I am excited about all these reviews and the positive results people are getting.  I order her Ultimate collection on Amazon and can't wait to get it.  I am even thinking about going out to buy myself a work out suit and new walking shoes...just unbelievable!  So I am really curious on how I will do with this next WW session WITH EXERCISE!  I will try to remember to come back and update this review to let you know how I did.

Any age would enjoy this routine!  I highly recommend this product!

UPDATE 03/2011:  Wow!  What a difference.  For the first month I exercised almost every day and then after started to alternate days or do it 3-4 times a week.  I did purchase more of her advance walking DVDs where you do ""Boosted Walking"" which is really low impact jogging - for two minutes each mile and found that I want to jog in place longer.  I really recommend you get more of her DVDs to change it up from time to time.  So here is what I have noticed.

I lost so many inches!  At the end of my first WW session I fit into a size 16 pants.  Now I fit into a size 12!  My butt is toning up because I do extra of the moves that seem to concentrate in that area (leg lifts and back kicks).  Lost an additional 11 pounds (for 27 total).  I don't have to do as much exercise because my metabolism has been built up to the point that missing a day is good and actually equalizes my body to help it keep losing.

People at work are seeing the difference and joining WW and borrowing this DVD.  It is so nice to be an inspiration.  Forget the expensive gym.  Stay at home!

I am proud to report, that since starting this exercise ""Walking at Home""  I have not gained at all which is amazing since some weeks I didn't do very well in the eating area.  I am single and eat out a lot!  But now, my body is processing the food so much more efficiently.  I still have 5 weeks left on this WW session and will report back later.  In summary...looking soooooo good and feeling it too!

UPDATE 05/01/2012:  I met my goal of 40 lbs back in Oct 2011 and have maintained my weight loss.  I signed up for WW Online just to keep on track.  I slacked off on doing the DVDs but that is going to change.  I just found out that the city that I live has been officially named the WORSE place for a single woman to walk NATIONWIDE!  So rather than take the big bat and pepper spray, I am just going to get back to Leslie.  She is still the best!

UPDATE 05/14/2013: Well, I have been on a forced vacation for a few months now and gained some weight back and have had some problems with my knees. Back to Leslie but I am not using the DVDs. I can now do it without the DVDs because it is so easily done. I add my own devised moves to change it up a bit. My weight is coming down again and I am feeling great.",1294099200,54,5801,4.059239610963749

Leslie works the entire body and is much more active during the entire workout.  I was doing the 3 mile workout on the VHS set, but was only able to barely finish the 2 mile DVD.  The belt with this set is also much improved over the belt that came with the VHS set -- it's stronger and therefore a better workout for the upper body.

Since I have been using the belt along w/the video, it has stepped up my workout and metabolism.  The only problem that I have had is that the belt is quite large and the bands didn't give me enough resistance so I replaced them.

3198763,5,B000WC38CS,"My main concern with other exercise videos is that they make them too complicated.  I am a busy student with a one-year old son.  Frankly, it is not relaxing or exciting for me to have to learn a bunch of new moves to exercise.  I have tried tai-bo, belly dancing, and other dance exercise videos and they must be good for those with better coordination, but not me.

That's why I love Leslie Sansone's videos.  She is so upbeat, happy and all through the video she gives you tips on how to increase or decrease the level of intensity so that really, this video can be for anyone at nearly any level of fitness.  My very active and fit husband tried to jump in and do the video with me at the two mile mark and found he could not keep up!

It is a heavy duty workout and the Walk Belt helps pump up the intensity of the walk. One thing I didn't like was that even though you can walk 1, 2 or 3 miles, you would have to stop in the middle of the workout at the mile markers. I like my earlier set that has separate workouts for 1, 2, and 3 miles with a warm up and cool down for each one. That way you do not just stop abruptly at 2 miles without gradually reducing the intensity. Otherwise, it's a great workout if you are up to 3 miles!",1267747200,,611,4.0578512396694215

I also liked that you get to choose if you want to do 1, mile, 2 miles or 3 miles. Although you don't get to use the be;t much in the first mile. If you want to really use the belt then I suggest you do at least 2 miles.

All of Leslie's workouts are great and I love the fact that she encourages everyone, no matter what shape they're in.  She explains that you can alter the intensity level and the main thing is to just keep walking.

Leslie is a talker and sometimes we do more reps than intended because she can't stop talking.  I find it humorous, others may find it annoying.

I was given Wii and Wii Fit for Christmas.  I thought Wii Fit would be my new exercise, but after a week or so, I was back to Leslie.  Wii Fit is not a substitute for 'real' exercise, and Leslie's DVD's are REAL exercise.  You will sweat, guaranteed!

In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great.

One thing I'd add about this program is that it is more than walking in place for three miles. You do simple moves - I'd call them like basic calisthenics - side steps and kicks - that keep it fun and work different muscles. That was a surprise to me and a good one.

Hope you enjoy this tape too. I'd definitely buy more of Leslie's stuff. Oh, and it helps that her ""helpers"" in the video are maybe 35-45+. Much more fun (for me as a middle aged woman anyway) than working out with some 20-somethings.",1262476800,,734,4.235714285714286
3198795,3,B000WC38CS,"Leslie Sansone is a woman who has profited greatly from simplicity. This walking workout has all the basic walking steps you will recognize from her other workouts but this time she uses a ""walk belt"" to tone the arms. The place I felt this workout the most was in my hips and abs. The only thing I'd recommend is that you make sure you have the walking belt on tight so it doesn't slip around or go up over your ribs when you lift your arms. Leslie uses the belt in other workouts so it is worth buying in this set. I think once you start doing this workout you will want to go for all three miles. You do of course have the option of only doing one or two miles. I'd recommend this to anyone who has been exercising for a couple of years. The pace is fairly fast and there are a lot of arm movements.

You feel like you just worked out with some friends.  I love my traditional walking but this video gives you an overall better workout targeting different parts of the body.  It's also a great stress buster too.  Thank you Leslie!,1254700800,2,402,4.513888888888889

I suffer(yes..suffer) with fibromyalgia and can't do anything to harsh to kill myself! :) and this is fine so far, I just walk nice and easy and my heart rate rises and I don't feel like I can't do it.

I was hoping to use it with my husband who also enjoys walking for better health, however my husband does not think that it is gender friendly.  He says the verbage is all geared towards women as well as there are no men in the video to support his theory.  Well I like it anyway.  If there are updated versions, that will put my husbands claims to rest, please let me know.

This is the first Walk at Home program I've tried and I actually feel like I'm doing something great for my body. Your heart rate gets going, you break into a sweat, and you need plenty of water after doing this Walk at Home program. Other reviewers mentioned that Leslie chats or laughs too much but I think it's great because it makes her seem like a regular person; plus, she also gets sweaty and needs to take a water break, which really makes her look less like an intimidating workout instructor. Yes, there were at least two times where she lost track of counting but c'mon, it won't hurt you to do three more reps of knee lifts, will it?

I can't wait to do this routine more; the 3 miles go by really fast and you feel encouraged to keep up your hard work. Highly recommended, especially because it comes with that neat band!",1248134400,6,959,4.211956521739131

Doing this video 1-3 times a week gives my body that different boost in calories burned to keep it losing weight at 2 miles. The music is okay. It's the workout I am looking for, not great tunes and this one fits the bill!

I love using it.  I'm not the skinniest of women & this belt fits around my waist just fine & it does remind me to keep my abs in while I'm working out.  This DVD does have a black background with the walkers, but that had no significance on me.  It was a good price for a great DVD, plus the walk band.  I just love Leslie's workouts.

But, I enjoy the workout though without the belt.  I just use my hand weights instead or you can even go without using anything.  I love her workouts!
The only other thing is that it doesn't stop after each mile.  It keeps going without any cool downs or stretches so you have the choice to keep going all the way to 3 miles.  I have the original Walk Away The Pounds dvd's and I like how they split them up into separate miles and with separate cool downs and stretches.  So, keep that in mind if you are used to doing that.",1243209600,10,677,4.007462686567164

Many of the hotels I stay in don't have decent fitness centers, or the fitness room isn't open when I finally have time to exercise after my shows late at night. Walking outside is often not an option in the dangerous and/or unfamiliar neighborhoods where the hotels are. This dvd is the perfect solution for me! At least, the concept is. I loved it the first two times through.  I liked her friendliness, positive attitude, and the fact that she included her girlfriends in the video. But her high pitched voice soon becomes grating -- too annoying to listen to.  And the canned music is awful!!  So I just turn the volume off and play music of my own choice while I walk along with them.  Now I often just do the routine on my own completely, without the dvd at all.  It was a great motivator, though, and I'm glad I bought the dvd. The belt is a good concept, but the elastic is too loose to give me much resistance.  When I'm at home, I skip the belt and use hand weights instead.",1241827200,2,1033,4.321243523316062

I've gone to love Leslie's Walk At Home DVDs. This one is super to target those areas that really to trim down. Belt adds just enough to tummy tuck, & add crunches while you cardiosize yourself.

When this came I thought I would give it a try, but since I go to the gym and take cardio classes often I wasn't sure if I would get a hard workout from this. I have to say I ended up loving this dvd! This dvd is great for all levels, since you can customize the movements and use the band more often than the girls on the dvd do if you want a little extra or you can not use it at all. I'd recommend this for people of all fitness levels whether you are an avid gym goer and want to add a little something extra to your daily workout or someone who is just beginning or trying to get back into exercise.

We feel terrific have lost weight and toned up- and generally the best thing that has ever happened to us- exercise wise!. The tape that we work out with was made in 2001- this one is much newer- Its nice - but a little to fast for us. She divides the walk into 3 different 1 mile walks on this one and hence its faster with stronger more vigorous miles, for those who want a good 15 minute(1 mile) workout) We always go three miles on the old one(45 minutes). I can't say enough about how good Leslie Sansones dvds are!
 Even though we do not yet feel fit enough to use the new DVD(and still use the old one!).. no mind-the belt was worth the price!",1241049600,4,857,4.011695906432749

*Like that it's 3 miles--so it can be a short day for me.
*Like using the walk belt. it's more comfortable than i expected too.
*Like Leslie and her upbeat personality

*Don't like that mile 3 is too low in intensity. it's like all of mile 3 is cool down. I want 3 intense miles and then a cool down. So, mile 3 is a big disappointment.
*Don't like that she hardly uses the belt. I was really looking forward to more resistance work and whe barely had us use the belt. Could have incorporated it better.
*Didn't care for the interaction b/n cast, espec the whole water and towel bit. They should have stopped taping or done it more than once and edited it better. I don't mind Leslie's chatter but this aspect was annoying.

I have not had a problem with the walk belt, as long as you have it on tight enough.

I liked this one so much I ordered 2 more.  I just did the 5 mile for the first time today and it is also a fantastic workout.

Oftentimes, she talks so much it can get annoying after you've heard it a few times - my sister and I have a lot of the things she says memorized! On this particular DVD, I do like the belt, and feel like it does help with working my arms more during the walking, which I think is great. I also do think it helps with me with my abs too, because I can tell the difference even when I just put it on. So for that, I do think this was a good purchase. However...I do find that Leslie really gets on my nerves in this one. Personally, I prefer the videos where she is by herself, but there are four others in this one with her. I just don't really like how she interacts with them - to me, it's very distracting. Obviously, it is for her too, considering how many times she seems to lose count or forget what she's supposed to be doing! Like I said, she does this in some of the other videos as well, but this one was worse. If it weren't for that, I would rate it much higher, because I do like the actual workout; I just could have done without all the chit-chat!",1239321600,17,1139,4.066666666666666

This video is great because the mile counter on the bottom of the screen lets you choose what type of workout you feel like doing.  Some days I only do 1, but most of the time I stop at 2 or 3.

The resistance band is also a great feature to this workout.  But, as Leslie tells us, it is a good workout without it too!  Some days my arms are too sore to use it, so I do the video without it.  I still feel great after working out and will continue to use her Dvd's and purchase more.  I have lost 40lbs watching my food intake and using Leslie's WATP's!

I have also recently gotten my 70 year old Mother to start using these workouts.  She loves the easy, gently 1 mile workout and has started doing these every morning!

If you workout consisently with this program, you will see results. I agree with the other reviewers that you may have to work up to the three miles. It took me two times before I could get through the three miles. I am still striving to be able to complete the three miles with full intensity for the third mile.

3198993,5,B000WC38CS,"I like this workout because I don't have to be super coordinated in order to do it - and as it states, it's a very good workout in just 45 short minutes.  Leslie's constant ""chatter"" gets a little annoying sometimes, but you can't help but enjoy the friendship that seems to exist between her and the other ladies.  And one of my favorite parts of this - those other ladies are mostly middle-aged or older, and don't look like young, sculpted beach babes.  These women are women just like me (except a little more fit) so that I feel like ""hey - I can do this"" instead of thinking ""good grief - I'll never look like THAT!""",1236816000,,622,4.299145299145299
3198994,5,B000WC38CS,"This is the first Leslie Sansone DVD that I have used and I bought it because of other customers favorable reviews. I started walking in the evenings to help my restless legs and this has really helped. It took me almost a week to be able to do the 3 miles but now it feels so good. I don't really notice a difference wearing the walk belt. There's a nice warm up and cool down which is great. I would recommend this to any walker, even those new to Leslie. I love how she is so upbeat and encouraging. I'm hooked and have to walk every night.",1235692800,,543,4.08411214953271
3198995,5,B000WC38CS,"I am a recent but BIG fan of Leslie Sansone. A few weeks ago, I discovered one of her 2-mile programs on my Exercise on Demand Cable channel. I am the proud survivor of two open-heart surgeries, and I'm always looking for a workout that I can keep up with. After doing that for only a few days, I just loved it. I was already firming up and losing weight, combined with eating well.

To ""kick it up a notch"" I decided to buy Walk Away Your Waistline. I tried it today for the first time and I feel fantastic. Some might think it's a bit too brisk for them after watching it. Please don't be intimidated! One of the wonderful things about Leslie is that she just encourages you to stay in motion and do things at your own pace.

The music on this DVD is perfect and really keeps you moving. Leslie Sansone is a very engaging, encouraging, and intelligent instructor. This really is a workout for everybody. You can do it! And you'll be so surprised and proud how quickly even a mile goes.

This DVD comes with her workout belt. If you've not been working out for a while, I'd suggest doing it without the belt for a while. As Leslie promises, you'll still get a fantastic workout. I did it without it, and I was sweating like heck! The moves are not too complicated, the pace is just right (even for a Cardiac patient), and you'll just feel fantastic after you're done.",1235520000,2,1368,4.315175097276264

Great workout.  Really is a good workout on the legs.  I agree with pretty much all the other reviews.  She does at least 3 basic steps besides just walking:  side steps, knee lifts, kick backs, incuding  variations.  I like the belt and wear it to work the core muscles even if I don't actually use the handles.",1233964800,,649,6.950617283950617
3199025,5,B000WC38CS,Leslie takes it up a notch in the video.  I love the walk belt because you can feel the difference when you use it during the workout.  She turns it up enough to break a sweat within the first mile.  One of her best workouts.,1233619200,,225,3.9555555555555557

I enjoy her structured pace and how she keeps the workout upbeat and before you know it the miles have past quickly. I would recommend these videos to both men and women who want to lose weight and have fun while doing it. Each video adds new and different moves and you never get bored.
Ordering from Amazon is easy and reliable. I have ordered from them for years and will continue to do so.  Amazon makes it easy to get whatever you need fast and you never have to worry if this site is secure.",1233532800,,647,4.217741935483871

You wouldn't think you've just worked out for 45 minutes and walked 3 miles! If you're not comfortable with doing all three, trust me and start out with the 1 mile marker and work your way on up. I use this DVD at least 3 days a week,and the walking belt included is helping to tone my muscles and slim my waistline. Don't worry about not being able to follow, she makes every mile easy to follow along.

As far as the workout I think it's good.  Definitely more than just walking, it's walking and a good exercise. The first time I did it around 9pm and couldn't fall asleep.

3199044,5,B000WC38CS,"I am really not a fan of exercise DVDs but a friend who has been using multiple forms of exercise to achieve her fitness goals recommended Leslie Sansome's DVDs to me. I have found this one to be amazingly valuable. I picked it because it has a focus on trimming the waistline (my most problem area) but it is a good aerobic workout too. You can adjust the intensity to suit you by making the movements larger or smaller according to your own fitness level. You can also do only 1 or 2 miles (15 min. each) if you do not have time for the full DVD which is only 45 minutes. When I opened the package I thought the resistance bands attached to the waist belt were wimpy but they are just right when you are doing arm exercises while walking aerobically! The belt also keeps you focused on tightening those abs during the workout. I am using the DVD several times a week and have not gotten bored with it. One last point to mention is that there are ""real"" women in the DVD doing the workout not models.",1231632000,2,1001,4.2460732984293195

3199046,5,B000WC38CS,"I bought this last summer and didn't even open the box until my New Year resolution.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I have tried a lot of different exercise workouts and for a 51 yr old non-exerciser, most included too much fancy foot work or jumping around.  This workout is great!  I started out with the first 15 minute mile and completed the entire 3 miles the first time.  This isn't about fancy footwork or jumping around.  It's about getting up and moving.  It's so simple to follow and by using your arms, you get just enough of a workout.  I discovered that by holding 1 lb weights during the routine, I could boost it up a bit.  I was so impressed with this workout, that I've been using it every morning for 15 minutes before work and the entire workout on the weekend.  This is my first Leslie Sansone workout and since then I've bought a few more, but this is one of my favorites of the bunch. I love how these are broken down into 15 minute segments. The waist belt is a great addition too.

This would be a great workout for someone who hasn't worked out in years, is very overweight or an older person because all you do is walk with a few small kicks, leg lifts and side steps.  If it's too much to use the arms, then just do the steps. The tempo of the music keeps you going.

On the negative side, Leslie's voice and laugh sort of gets on my nerves more so than in her other workouts but it's tolerable.",1230854400,6,1426,4.237037037037037

The belt can be tightened very very small and I can't imagine a human being that small so I didn't bother to measure at the smallest adjustment.",1229904000,2,337,4.106060606060606

In fact I could feel more in my waistline area during other parts of the tape. I did like the workout. It is a good 3 mile workout but the belt is not used to its best advantage.

I usually go to the gym but I run short on time some days and thought this would be a good substitute to my cardio workout at the gym.  I like Leslie, she gives good advice about health and exercise in general and the workout is totally low impact for those of us with back and knee problems.  I get the most out of it with the walk belt.  It was challenging at first but after a few runs at it, I don't feel I break into that much of a sweat.  It does make for a good cardio workout when I am in a pinch.

I have to wake up at 4:30 a.m. as it is my only time to workout (with work and the baby) and there are some mornings that I just don't want to do it. On those mornings I really just think about what Leslie says to you during the workout ""You'll feel so much better"" ""You never say you wished you hadn't worked out"" etc... things like that get me out of bed and get me moving, and she's right. I have more energy, I feel stronger, and I am looking better already. I have dropped 5 pounds in one week (while eating right).

I asked what she did that kept her so trim and toned....she said Leslie Sansone. I wrote the name down and thought no more about it until 3 weeks ago.

I have rediscovered her on ""On Demand"" TV and now I am hooked!  She is greatly improved and it is a fun workout.  What is the most important factor in an exercise program?  The ability to keep on doing it on a regular basis and for me, I feel this is it because:  1.  Easy to follow  2.  No jarring high impact moves  3.  No feeling of ""I can't keep up""  4.  Yet you feel like you had a great workout  5.  And very important, I enjoy the music.  I cannot overestimate the importance of that.  If I don't like the background music, it just ruins it for me.

It is a good workout, however I found it somewhat awkward to follow: I prefer to get into a rhythm and follow in time with her leg movements, and it kept skipping or having unexpected changes (usually when camera off her) that threw me off and were annoying to have to correct. The bigger disappointment though it that the stretches at the end stopped short of equal movements on each side. It is fine, can make it work, it just feels less fun than it could be.",1218326400,11,557,4.365384615384615

I have her 5 mile workout which is great, but I like to do different workouts so I combine this 3 mile workout with another 3 mile workout (only use two miles of one with 3 of another).  So these are really many workouts that you can make yourself!  Leslie is so encouraging during the workout and very sincere (even if sometimes she seems a little corny).

Well after falling off the workout wagon for a few years, I decided to get back on and see if Leslie had added to her workout options. HAS SHE EVER! This is a GREAT workout for beginners and experts alike. The DVD format allows you to do one, two, or three miles (so beginners can start with one mile and then go straight to the cool down). And it's not so ""perfect."" Everyone sweats, they break for towels and water, and some of the girls even mess up from time to time, which makes me feel better when I mess up myself. :-) This is a great way to start the day, break a sweat, and feel you've accomplished something.

I love most of her workouts, and vary them to keep from getting bored. I LOVE the fact that this one is speeded up to the pace of 5 miles per hour, instead of the usual 4mph. I have some older workouts with the belt, but this one is faster paced and I sweated!!!! It has the usual steps for those of us who are uncoordinated for the workouts with too many dance steps.

My only criticism is that during the stretching exercises after the workout, Leslie takes you through what she calls ""yoga inpired"" stretches on one side of the body, but when we switch to the other side, she doesn't repeat those stretches; she just ends after the hamstring stretch.  No worries . . . I repeat the ""yoga-inspired"" stretches while she's giggling with her ""Sisters in Sweat""!",1212796800,2,616,4.675925925925926

The combination of aerobics and strength training with the belt really gives you a complete workout. My exercise previous to this was a two to three mile walk in my neighborhood. This really kicks it up. I think first time exercisers will like the fact that you can start with one mile and then build up to the complete 3 miles. The last mile was easy once you are able to complete the two miles because the intensity lessens. What a bargain, too. Going to the gym requires more time and more money and this is just as good and you can do this whenever you want. I would highly recommend this product.",1211846400,4,689,4.3076923076923075

Unfortunately for me it was not Leslie's best workout it was slow and hardly got you sweating or your heart rate up.  I struggle with my weight so I need a really good work out all the time.

I love that there's absolutely no pressure to follow perfectly, just so that ""you're moving"", as she says. And this particular video gives you steps that you can build to. You can choose to use the walkBelt or not, you can do the arms or not, do 1, 2, or all 3 miles. Whatever you feel like. Though I have to admit I've only worked up to 2 miles, and the 2nd mile is pretty tough. I would say the 2nd and 3rd miles aren't for beginners, as they're pretty tough.

I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do the workouts because I've been sitting on the sofa for so long, but this is a workout anyone can do.  I live in Arizona and in the summer it's just too hot to go outside so this is ideal for me.

The workout is divided into 3 seperate miles so you have the choice in the amount of time you spend, if you are busy.  Also, she updates you along the way as to how far and how fast you have been walking.  She is a very peppy person (sometimes to the point of being irritating) but you can get past it.  The walk belt is a good addition too.  It provides resistance as you do the walking moves.
