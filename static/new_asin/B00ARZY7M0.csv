8557282,4,B00ARZY7M0,"There are only 7 movies in this. ""Stable Days: The Road to Jumping"" is a documentary(a day in the life of a little girl who rides a horse and she grooms him and stuff). I didn't watch that so I can't tell you much about it. They should not have put it in. They should only have included actual movies. The actual movies are great. I love
them. There are 4 on each disc. There is no
play all feature, but if you chapter skip before end credits are over you will get to the next movie, except for ""Stable Days"". ""Stable Days"" is first on the disc and once it is over then you have to go to the first actual movie which is ""The Little Unicorn"" You can chapter skip the movies after that. The discs are single sided. Most if not all are widescreen. The reason I am not sure is because I make my movies into fullscreen. My dvd player has that feature. The other thing I don't like is that they keep putting duplicates in these sets.
The actual movies are:
*Wind Dancer
*Seeker & Fetch
*The Little Unicorn
*Gordy
*Bigfoot: The Unforgettable Encounter
*Little Bigfoot 2: The Journey Home
*Grand Prix: The Winning Tale
*Little Bigfoot 2: The Journey Home
Documentary:
*Stable Days The Road to Jumping",1364688000,,1192,4.349775784753363
