3135060,4,B0014VPFPO,"This is not an all inclusive documentary or very thorough. It's shown from a U.S. military viewpoint with interviews of surviving U.S. veterans. It's all on one disc and about 2 and 1/2 hours long.
It picks up the war in the early 1960's with JFK sending military advisors and ends with the fall of Saigon in 1975, with veterans giving thier recollections for the battles and the time periods they served.
The battle footage is excellent, hard hitting, and not for the faint of heart (lots of blood and gore).
There are interviews with some very famous veterans.  Colonel Hal Moore (who Mel Gibson portrayed in the movie ""We Were Soldiers"").  Philip Caputo, who wrote an excellent early account of his experience in Vietnam, ""A Rumor of War"". Retired General Barry McCaffrey, a military analyst for Fox News, I believe, are the three I knew of.
I'm a 22 year Army veteran.  I joined the Army in 1972 but didn't go to Vietnam (by the the time I went into basic training in April 1972, the U.S. military's commitment in personnel there had dropped way down to around 50,000).  But,as a teenager in the mid to late 1960's, I watched the war unfold on the nightly news and wondered after I turned 18 would I get drafted and go there.  This war had some meaning in my early life, of course no way like those who actually served.
The recollection of some of the veterans gave me a lump in my throat and misty eyes.  Very powerful emotional stuff.
But on the negative side.  There are no interviews with any surviving NVA soldiers or Viet Cong, or any South Vietnamese.
It doesn't cover at all how Vietnam became divided in 1954 or the French involvement prior to that.  The political wrangling and protests in the U.S. are covered just enough to get the jist.
This is still a very good documentary.  Very powerful.",1218499200,122,1808,4.555555555555555

3135063,5,B0014VPFPO,A fantastic overview of the Vietnam War. I now feel like I know the main aspects of what the whole thing was about. This is a very fact-based recollection of the war - including many vet's perspectives - as opposed to almost every other liberally-biased documentary that is shoved down our throats! I have a newfound respect for our veterans. May God bless you!,1462838400,,361,4.65625

3135071,5,B0014VPFPO,I especially liked it because the documentary covered the war from South Vietnam to the DMZ with a great overview of the war from 1965 thru 1975 without concentrating on any specific aspect or operations during that time.  Whether for anyone who had served in Vietnam or someone who wants to learn more about U S involvement there the DVD presents a very attention getting perspective.,1427068800,2,385,4.833333333333333
3135072,5,B0014VPFPO,"I bought this knowing previous conceptions of Nat'l Geographic works wasn't good; I was surprised this didn't have all the liberal crap that is usually said about the US involvement in that war.  Starting with the history of VN and ending on the roof of the US Embassy in April, 1975 it was a well balanced telling of that conflict.  I extend my sincere appreciation to the producer for keeping the bias out and just the facts in made the viewing worthwhile.  For the first time I had second thoughts about my own service and why I volunteered to serve in Viet Nam, hind sight is not fore sight and it is too late to change history.  Recommend this to everyone and especially VN veterans who would appreciate a straight forward look back to the war we didn't lose.",1419292800,,764,4.474820143884892

3135083,5,B0014VPFPO,"A National Geographic production.  I trust this company to excel above others in anything they produce.  My Viet Nam husband wanted this, and watches it frequently.  Historically and graphically on the mark.",1387324800,,207,5.40625
3135084,5,B0014VPFPO,"This is probably one of the best documentaries about the Vietnam war that I have viewed in a very long time and, in fact, on my all time list. Much of the footage is new and not the same old stock footage that you see in too many other documentaries. National Geographic has produced a winner here. I am not very generous with 5 stars, but this one deserves all five. In my opinion, you won't be disappointed with this video. You just won't want it to end. The only knock that I have on this video is the same one that I have on every other Vietnam video and that is that no one ever questions why Walter Cronkite was never challenged as a military expert when he made his scathing attack on the abilities of the US forces in Vietnam. Cronkite had no standing to make the statements that he did and since there was a fairness doctrine in force at the time, someone should have insisted on time on the CBS Evening News to challenge Cronkite and explain where he had no basis for the slander he had committed against all the forces there.

Also, why Johnson, McNamara and Dean Rusk were such chickens when it came to all out war in Indochina. If it was intelligence failures, then the CIA and the NSA should have been dissolved and intelligence gathering initiated from anew. It was patently obvious to even the most casual observer that neither China nor the Soviets were willing to fall on their swords and risk a nuclear war with the US over Vietnam. China was also not prepared for the losses that the B-52 Arc Light sorties would have inflicted on a conventional army and the devastation that would have resulted on southern China from such raids. The Soviets were in no way, shape or form ready to involve itself in this battle because it still had problems in other places and other client states that consumed too much of their resources to support the necessary commitment to sustain a campaign. The US didn't have to conquer North Vietnam, just go so far as to stop the flow of men and equipment and assassinate the leaders in the North who didn't fall into line. Furthermore, Laos and Cambodia should have been dealt with openly, not in a clandestine manner. Finally, the Johnson and/or Nixon administrations should have made a concerted propaganda effort to sell the war to the people of the US. If that had been done early on and had there been anyone but an incompetent fool as the commanding general, the entire course and outcome of this war had the fundamental framework for a very different outcome. That I have never seen in any documentary and why I usually don't give out 5 stars. This one earned its stars because it didn't rely on the same old footage and narrative of most other documentaries. It still doesn't get down to the short hairs as any proper documentary should, but it makes up for it with non-conventional viewings of the war.

The most fundamental question is, why wasn't the Joint Chiefs and Johnson ready to fire Westmoreland after is first disastrous campaign in the Iron Triangle and the C and D Zones around it. The proper commander of US forces in Vietnam should have been the Marine commanding general and he should have been appointed for the duration, as WWII was conducted. Westmoreland was an idiot. The Marines had the right idea about how to win the hearts and minds of the peasants. The US Forces also should have been allowed to force a fair and open election for leadership with a proper three branch government that would have engaged the people in the electoral process and thus the chauvinism of a defense of their homeland. These questions have never been properly explored in any documentary of the era and thus leave you with no better understanding of the reason for the failure of the Vietnam campaign to achieve any objectives at all. This documentary doesn't answer all of these issue or even address them as it should, but it makes up for it in very interesting new footage.",1386460800,2,3936,4.565770862800566
3135085,5,B0014VPFPO,"Really new material that I haven't seen before. For my opinion better than most of the other

3135087,5,B0014VPFPO,"I have two sets of films on the Vietnam War which I can recommend: ""Battlefield Vietnam; from Dien Bien Phu to Peace With Honor"" and ""Vietnam in HD: It's Not The War We Know, It's The War They Fought"" from The History Channel on Blu-ray, ""Inside the  Vietnam War "" is the best film I have seen on the war because of the extensive interviews of the Americans who fought the war. I salute those who fought and woke up with nightmares for years after they returned home. Vietnam is a war we lost, but the brave men who fought it are not to blame. Our leaders made many mistakes. I recommend three award winning documentaries that provide insights on some of our leaders during the war: ""The Fog of War"" on Robert McNamara, ""The Trials of Henry Kissinger"" and ""The Most Dangerous Man In America"" on Daniel Ellsberg, Finally, I would like to mention ""S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine"" about Cambodia's Killing Fields during the Nixon-Kissinger era in Vietnam,",1384041600,4,958,4.60233918128655

3135092,4,B0014VPFPO,"I am trying to document what I went through in Vietnam in 1966 and 1967, but seems like everyting I found, documented the lies the politicians were telling the folks back home. Then I found this, thanks to National Geographic for holding 98% of this to what REALLY was going on there, not what  the politicians were telling the people. It was Hell there, and a lot of the hell was brought down on the troops, by our own Commanders, and Politicians. I once got a ride with an F4 Phantom heading out on a bombing mission over Hanoi, after we were airborne, the pilot told me, we were not going to bomb Hanoi, instead we dropped our bombs on wooden bridges over small creeks in the rice fields. The pilot explained to me, that all of our bombers were doing that, due to orders coming down telling them, they should NOT bomb areas of North Vietnam's cities, and manufacturing areas. With no destructive air power to slow or stop manufacturing of weapons in the North, how could we win.

3135095,4,B0014VPFPO,"I watched this documentary in its entirity on the NGC. IT IS AN EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY FOR AN ORGANIZATION KNOWN FOR DOCUMENTARIES!!!  And as a point. MY USE OF CAPS IS NOT SHOUTING ... I USE IT STRICTLY AS EMPHASIS!!

For you who are upset the the poor little Vietnamese weren't represented.  Wake up. Drink a touch of coffee, a latte', a tea, or whatever it is you folks drink today and pay attention to what's being said/presented. The documentary is MEANT TO BE about the AMERICAN SERVICEMAN WHO SERVED IN COUNTRY/THEATER. Not our enemy or those we were there to assist. (Yeah, that means the poor little South Vietnamese. Who for the most part, bought in on the lies we were some sort of ""monster"" come to ""drag them to hell"" and eat them and their babies. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THEY SAW DIFFERENTLY!!) For those of you who are STILL PROTESTING VIETNAM, AND DOING SO BY ACTIVELY PROTESTING THIS WAR AND OUR TROOPS JUST AS YOU DID US, STOP READING NOW AND GO AWAY! AIN'T NOTHIN' I GOT TO SAY OR CAN SAY, WILL CHANGE Y'ALLS GORKED UP MINDS. Just take another hit; another toke; and go off to SGT. Pepper's Valley, while the rest of us intelligently, reasonably discuss and consider.

I served IN COUNTRY, 14 months as a U.S. ARMY MEDICAL CORPSMAN, 91B10 & 91B20. I saw, lived with, treated, and held hands, heads, and guts of the dead, dieing, and those trying to put all that back together themselves, belonging to American soldiers, South Vietnamese Soldiers, South Vietnamese civilians (including some children), more Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Regulars than I care to think about, and here's a cherry on top of this cupcake. Seven South Vietnamese Catholic nuns and a priest, and some American CHRISTIAN Missionaries, either Later Day Saints, 7th Day Adventist, or plane old Pentecostal. I'm not sure if I ever knew which. But we had a reason for fighting in Vietnam. And at one point, we had leaders who cared!

Our reason for fighting can be summed up in the statement of a Retired US Marine, Gunnery Sergeant Charles A Lockhart, Jr. (Deceased). A 3 tour Vietnam veteran, and a Korean War veteran. Uncle Chuck said, ""We fight 'em there, in Vietnam, Son, because if we don't, we'll fight 'em at home. See Son, the Communists are already in South and Central America raising cane. Causing problems. They call them, ""revolucions'.""  And they too convince the people to be afraid of places like America, England and other countries that enjoy freedom. They convince people they can't function independently being free. So they need, THE STATE. THEY CONVINCE THEM THEY CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THAT HELP IS IN THE FORM OF WELFARE HANDOUTS. AND THE PEOPLE GET DUPED INTO BELIEVEING THAT'S THE BEST THEY CAN DO. AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T PROVIDE WHAT THE ENEMY SAYS THEY DESERVE, THEY TELL THEM, 'REVOLT! BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SERVING YOU AS THEY SHOULD. WE CAN SHOW YOU AND GIVE YOU A NEW AND BETTER WAY, BY TAKING ALL THE MONEY FROM ALL THE RICH, AND REDISTRIBUTING IT. MAKING ALL THE BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED, THUS MAKING SURE YOU HAVE FOOD AND CLOTHES AT A FAIR PRICE. BY CONTROLLING ALL MEDICAL CARE SO EVERYONE HAS MEDICAL CARE REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. CONTROLLING TRNSPORTATION, HOUSING, UTILITIES AND EVERYTHING, SO EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL SHARE.' And from that point on, people buy into a pipe dream, with gold at the end of the tunnel. Only to live under a tyrant, dictator, or totally controlling government that says, 'No. You can't have that three bedroom apartment. Even though you have children and need it. That man, uh, Mr. Trump,(only taking liberty here) needed it more.' No reason given other than that Son. Just, 'WE SAID SO. WE'RE THE GOVERNMENT. WE KNOW BEST. NOW SHUT UP. TAKE WHAT YOU GET, OR GO TO ... STALAG!' And if we're not careful, those people will be in America one day. Starting a civil war, or starting social upheavel by being elected to political office. Those are who get many of these internal national struggles started Son. I hope you have an idea now, Frank, why American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, fight.""

And this documentary, with it's LIBERAL FLARES, shows much of that. The WHY, Americans from Bunker Hill, to Kabul and Kandahar, from Appamatox to Iwo Jima, to Pork Chop and Hamburger Hills, and why America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will continue to fight where we're sent. And why we'll die if we're called on to lay our lives down. Because we don't want the wolf at our nation's door.

I think, if you watch the video, LISTEN TO VETERAN INTERVIEWS, then put the video footage and the interviews TOGETHER, you, as the viewer, will completely see that.

3135097,5,B0014VPFPO,"For those of us who were never there, this is just another perspective - and a valuable one. For those who seek to criticize without substance, it is a waste of money. For me, any perspective into this war is good enough for me. I still seek to find out why the United States government would continually ignore the plight of the soldier's desire to do what they were there for - to win the war. I am constantly amazed when I read that Johnson and Nixon halted bombing when the servicemen just about begged to intensify it and shorten the war. And, I am disappointed in my government's actions that resulted in 58,000 dead Americans and 5,000 downed helicopters.

To the military industrial complex, I say shame on you. You sought to profit from 58 thousand dead Americans who had no focus to follow in winning the Vietnam War while you made millions upon millions. Hopefully, history will blame you and not the American soldier or communist guerilla who were there on orders from a generation of older leaders who remained in the comfort of their complexes and homes.

So, this is indeed a fresh look into a problematic situation which we all hope will not be repeated. Going to war without a purpose, or single goal, is wrong. And, to send young men and women into battle only to lose their lives, limbs or sanity is just plain wrong. We, who have replaced the older generation of that time, owe it to our future warriors to learn from this tragic experience and avoid wars without purpose or focus. This DVD will make us cry, like many others, and I hope learn just what how much the consequences hurt.",1337385600,12,1605,4.531034482758621
3135098,2,B0014VPFPO,"Not terribly useful if one is looking for anything in detail about this long conflict. A n umber of scenes used over and over and over as if there was a paucity of decent film clips. No mention that Walter Cronkite got the significance of Tet '68 totally wrong. It skips lightly over Kennedy's motivations for sending troops in the early 60's, McNamara's duplicity over the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and Johnson's incompetence as commander-in-chief / target analyst for the USAF. At the end of it, I was disappointed. Recommend a good book instead.",1330128000,10,547,4.829787234042553
3135099,4,B0014VPFPO,"So, I just got this dvd and I thought it was pretty decent but nothing that hasn't been covered before. This was somewhat generic as far as the information goes and there wasn't real great combat footage. There were many scenes of actual footage but not much engagement. I think they left out the graphic stuff because this was originally on tv. Also, like every other Vietnam documentary, it excludes most of the war crimes committed, especially anything mentioning agent orange. But aside from all this, the documentary was well done, it definitely wasn't boring and the footage was very crisp and clear, obviously remastered because this is a newer documentary.

3135101,4,B0014VPFPO,"I viewed this DVD and decided to add it to my collection on the History of Vietnam.  I protested the war and all wars beginning with Vietnam.  I had several friends who served and I myelf was drafted three times, the last time I had a back injury, that kept me from going with a classification of 1Y.  I'm proud I protested this war because it was started and faught for the political and military advantage.  Ho Chi Minh was the George Washington of Vietnam during and after WWII, he was stab in the back by america, britian and france, allowing france to take back it's colony.  I'm not stupid and these war heroes who can't recognize that Vietnam wasn't going to be controlled by anyone, need to grow up.  There are DVD'S from the Vietnam point of view.  I visited Vietnam for my own personal history to see what the country was really like and why so many people had to die.  It reminds me of george w, bush and that idiot dick chaney creating two wars with two credit cards to finance it.
Vietnam was worth the trip and I would recommend that any veteran return if they can, the people were very generous and not at all resentful of the end outcome.  I was all over Saigon, Mekong Delta, Da Nang, Hue, Mi Son and Hanoi, I was able to see far more of Vietnam than the soldiers who had to fight to protect american business anf political interests and issues.  If you can't appreciate my point of view fine, I still meet with friends who served, there not critical of my point of view.  The soldier's being interviewed condemn Vietnam for the atrocities; every pilot dropping bombs from 20,000 feet was no more than a HOMECIDE BOMBER, and that includes J.

I found this film to be helpful in the chronological order of things. It also gave me new insights into the problematic duration of the war.  One being the change of four very different American presidents during this time. There never appeared to be a clear cut
plan on what the objective was except to kill as many NV as possible.  Very sad and harrowing to see what our fighting men and women went through and how the South Vietnamese were ""left"" to fend for themselves.",1291075200,12,599,4.588785046728972
3135104,4,B0014VPFPO,"I've read all the reviews, I've seem all the movies and Documentaries,nothing comes close to what Viet Nam was like for the Combat Vet. I served 3 tours in Viet Nam and what this does not show like all the others, was the smells and oders of the dead and dying ,that is something you can never forget or never describe. The true sounds of the war. What it felt like to see your best friend in pieces on the ground. I to was a Volenteer, and came back 3 times total, not because I loved it but I was young dumb and single. I really thought I could save a Dad with kids from going over. War is War I won't go into the details this missed or was right about it. When I came back from my last tour I was in the Hospital For over a Year. During the last few month I was able to leave the hospital for afew hours, that I loved , what I hated we were not allowed to wear our uniforms off base. Seems they were offencive to many of the locals. The things that went on in that country cost me alot , my first heart attack at 29, 3 bouts with cancer, at 61 I can bearly walk, but that is ok I am better off then many. For many many year I hate what the war did to me and others , I hated the way We were treated when we came home, I hate the fact that many more died after coming home from everything for cancer to taking their own lives. For year I could not stand watching how good the troops were treated when they were coming home from other wars, I felt cheat again, I was jealous. Two weeks ago that all changed. I was in a Fry's store (a supermarket ) It was Vetern's week so Had on a Viet Nam vet hat and shirt. I was standing looking at something and felt a light tapping on my back. I turn to find what looked to be a brother and sister maybe 7 to 8 years old, they looked up at me ( i could see just alittle fear in their eyes ).

3135108,5,B0014VPFPO,"Inside the Vietnam War is AN EXCELLENT FILM based on true and/or actual events that happen during a trying time in US history. Having a lot of friends and associates serve in the war gave me a better understanding of what actually happened and a disturbing opinion about the people behind the decision making in the white house.

However, more importantly, this film gave me a better perspective of the way the US media reported events and how they tried to manipulate US citizen's public opinion about this war. We should be outraged. The part of the film that showed Walter Cronkite indicating the TET offensive was a ""stalemate"" was treasonist. Although I do not remember the exact numbers, the body count of the offensive was overwhelmingly in favor of the Americans. Somewhere near 100,000 enemies killed to less than a thousand Americans. In addition, there was not one single offensive launched by the Vietcong (VC) and/or North Vietnam Army (NVA) that the American military did not overtake and win. NOT ONE. And this is undisputed.

In the end, war is HELL. But you go to war to win. And if successfully killing the enemy is an indication of winning the war, then the American military was overwhelmingly successful. The final numbers are mind-boggling; over 1.5 million VC/NVA (and unfortunately Vietnam citizens) to roughly 58,000 American military personnel.

We all should be proud of our American men and women in uniform. They did not ask to go there; they were told and given orders. They obeyed, did their job and did it well. We should be more worried about our decision makers and policy makers than our military.

This film should help everyone become more informative about this war.",1244073600,29,1704,4.885813148788928

3369557,4,B0014VPFPO,"This is not an all inclusive documentary or very thorough. It's shown from a U.S. military viewpoint with interviews of surviving U.S. veterans. It's all on one disc and about 2 and 1/2 hours long.
It picks up the war in the early 1960's with JFK sending military advisors and ends with the fall of Saigon in 1975, with veterans giving thier recollections for the battles and the time periods they served.
The battle footage is excellent, hard hitting, and not for the faint of heart (lots of blood and gore).
There are interviews with some very famous veterans.  Colonel Hal Moore (who Mel Gibson portrayed in the movie ""We Were Soldiers"").  Philip Caputo, who wrote an excellent early account of his experience in Vietnam, ""A Rumor of War"". Retired General Barry McCaffrey, a military analyst for Fox News, I believe, are the three I knew of.
I'm a 22 year Army veteran.  I joined the Army in 1972 but didn't go to Vietnam (by the the time I went into basic training in April 1972, the U.S. military's commitment in personnel there had dropped way down to around 50,000).  But,as a teenager in the mid to late 1960's, I watched the war unfold on the nightly news and wondered after I turned 18 would I get drafted and go there.  This war had some meaning in my early life, of course no way like those who actually served.
The recollection of some of the veterans gave me a lump in my throat and misty eyes.  Very powerful emotional stuff.
But on the negative side.  There are no interviews with any surviving NVA soldiers or Viet Cong, or any South Vietnamese.
It doesn't cover at all how Vietnam became divided in 1954 or the French involvement prior to that.  The political wrangling and protests in the U.S. are covered just enough to get the jist.

I extend my sincere appreciation to the producer for keeping the bias out and just the facts in made the viewing worthwhile.

3369581,5,B0014VPFPO,"This is probably one of the best documentaries about the Vietnam war that I have viewed in a very long time and, in fact, on my all time list. Much of the footage is new and not the same old stock footage that you see in too many other documentaries. National Geographic has produced a winner here. I am not very generous with 5 stars, but this one deserves all five. In my opinion, you won't be disappointed with this video. You just won't want it to end. The only knock that I have on this video is the same one that I have on every other Vietnam video and that is that no one ever questions why Walter Cronkite was never challenged as a military expert when he made his scathing attack on the abilities of the US forces in Vietnam. Cronkite had no standing to make the statements that he did and since there was a fairness doctrine in force at the time, someone should have insisted on time on the CBS Evening News to challenge Cronkite and explain where he had no basis for the slander he had committed against all the forces there.

Also, why Johnson, McNamara and Dean Rusk were such chickens when it came to all out war in Indochina. If it was intelligence failures, then the CIA and the NSA should have been dissolved and intelligence gathering initiated from anew. It was patently obvious to even the most casual observer that neither China nor the Soviets were willing to fall on their swords and risk a nuclear war with the US over Vietnam. China was also not prepared for the losses that the B-52 Arc Light sorties would have inflicted on a conventional army and the devastation that would have resulted on southern China from such raids. The Soviets were in no way, shape or form ready to involve itself in this battle because it still had problems in other places and other client states that consumed too much of their resources to support the necessary commitment to sustain a campaign. The US didn't have to conquer North Vietnam, just go so far as to stop the flow of men and equipment and assassinate the leaders in the North who didn't fall into line. Furthermore, Laos and Cambodia should have been dealt with openly, not in a clandestine manner. Finally, the Johnson and/or Nixon administrations should have made a concerted propaganda effort to sell the war to the people of the US. If that had been done early on and had there been anyone but an incompetent fool as the commanding general, the entire course and outcome of this war had the fundamental framework for a very different outcome. That I have never seen in any documentary and why I usually don't give out 5 stars. This one earned its stars because it didn't rely on the same old footage and narrative of most other documentaries. It still doesn't get down to the short hairs as any proper documentary should, but it makes up for it with non-conventional viewings of the war.

The most fundamental question is, why wasn't the Joint Chiefs and Johnson ready to fire Westmoreland after is first disastrous campaign in the Iron Triangle and the C and D Zones around it. The proper commander of US forces in Vietnam should have been the Marine commanding general and he should have been appointed for the duration, as WWII was conducted. Westmoreland was an idiot. The Marines had the right idea about how to win the hearts and minds of the peasants. The US Forces also should have been allowed to force a fair and open election for leadership with a proper three branch government that would have engaged the people in the electoral process and thus the chauvinism of a defense of their homeland. These questions have never been properly explored in any documentary of the era and thus leave you with no better understanding of the reason for the failure of the Vietnam campaign to achieve any objectives at all. This documentary doesn't answer all of these issue or even address them as it should, but it makes up for it in very interesting new footage.",1386460800,2,3936,4.565770862800566

It was Hell there, and a lot of the hell was brought down on the troops, by our own Commanders, and Politicians.

The pilot explained to me, that all of our bombers were doing that, due to orders coming down telling them, they should NOT bomb areas of North Vietnam's cities, and manufacturing areas.

Who for the most part, bought in on the lies we were some sort of ""monster"" come to ""drag them to hell"" and eat them and their babies. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THEY SAW DIFFERENTLY!!)

AIN'T NOTHIN' I GOT TO SAY OR CAN SAY, WILL CHANGE Y'ALLS GORKED UP MINDS. Just take another hit; another toke; and go off to SGT. Pepper's Valley, while the rest of us intelligently, reasonably discuss and consider.

I served IN COUNTRY, 14 months as a U.S. ARMY MEDICAL CORPSMAN, 91B10 & 91B20. I saw, lived with, treated, and held hands, heads, and guts of the dead, dieing, and those trying to put all that back together themselves, belonging to American soldiers, South Vietnamese Soldiers, South Vietnamese civilians (including some children), more Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Regulars than I care to think about, and here's a cherry on top of this cupcake. Seven South Vietnamese Catholic nuns and a priest, and some American CHRISTIAN Missionaries, either Later Day Saints, 7th Day Adventist, or plane old Pentecostal. I'm not sure if I ever knew which. But we had a reason for fighting in Vietnam. And at one point, we had leaders who cared!

Our reason for fighting can be summed up in the statement of a Retired US Marine, Gunnery Sergeant Charles A Lockhart, Jr. (Deceased). A 3 tour Vietnam veteran, and a Korean War veteran. Uncle Chuck said, ""We fight 'em there, in Vietnam, Son, because if we don't, we'll fight 'em at home. See Son, the Communists are already in South and Central America raising cane. Causing problems. They call them, ""revolucions'.""  And they too convince the people to be afraid of places like America, England and other countries that enjoy freedom. They convince people they can't function independently being free. So they need, THE STATE. THEY CONVINCE THEM THEY CAN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THAT HELP IS IN THE FORM OF WELFARE HANDOUTS. AND THE PEOPLE GET DUPED INTO BELIEVEING THAT'S THE BEST THEY CAN DO. AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T PROVIDE WHAT THE ENEMY SAYS THEY DESERVE, THEY TELL THEM, 'REVOLT! BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SERVING YOU AS THEY SHOULD. WE CAN SHOW YOU AND GIVE YOU A NEW AND BETTER WAY, BY TAKING ALL THE MONEY FROM ALL THE RICH, AND REDISTRIBUTING IT. MAKING ALL THE BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED, THUS MAKING SURE YOU HAVE FOOD AND CLOTHES AT A FAIR PRICE. BY CONTROLLING ALL MEDICAL CARE SO EVERYONE HAS MEDICAL CARE REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. CONTROLLING TRNSPORTATION, HOUSING, UTILITIES AND EVERYTHING, SO EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL SHARE.' And from that point on, people buy into a pipe dream, with gold at the end of the tunnel. Only to live under a tyrant, dictator, or totally controlling government that says, 'No. You can't have that three bedroom apartment. Even though you have children and need it. That man, uh, Mr. Trump,(only taking liberty here) needed it more.' No reason given other than that Son. Just, 'WE SAID SO. WE'RE THE GOVERNMENT. WE KNOW BEST. NOW SHUT UP. TAKE WHAT YOU GET, OR GO TO ... STALAG!' And if we're not careful, those people will be in America one day. Starting a civil war, or starting social upheavel by being elected to political office. Those are who get many of these internal national struggles started Son. I hope you have an idea now, Frank, why American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, fight.""

And this documentary, with it's LIBERAL FLARES, shows much of that. The WHY, Americans from Bunker Hill, to Kabul and Kandahar, from Appamatox to Iwo Jima, to Pork Chop and Hamburger Hills, and why America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will continue to fight where we're sent. And why we'll die if we're called on to lay our lives down. Because we don't want the wolf at our nation's door.

I think, if you watch the video, LISTEN TO VETERAN INTERVIEWS, then put the video footage and the interviews TOGETHER, you, as the viewer, will completely see that.

3369594,5,B0014VPFPO,"For those of us who were never there, this is just another perspective - and a valuable one. For those who seek to criticize without substance, it is a waste of money. For me, any perspective into this war is good enough for me. I still seek to find out why the United States government would continually ignore the plight of the soldier's desire to do what they were there for - to win the war. I am constantly amazed when I read that Johnson and Nixon halted bombing when the servicemen just about begged to intensify it and shorten the war. And, I am disappointed in my government's actions that resulted in 58,000 dead Americans and 5,000 downed helicopters.

To the military industrial complex, I say shame on you. You sought to profit from 58 thousand dead Americans who had no focus to follow in winning the Vietnam War while you made millions upon millions. Hopefully, history will blame you and not the American soldier or communist guerilla who were there on orders from a generation of older leaders who remained in the comfort of their complexes and homes.

So, this is indeed a fresh look into a problematic situation which we all hope will not be repeated. Going to war without a purpose, or single goal, is wrong. And, to send young men and women into battle only to lose their lives, limbs or sanity is just plain wrong. We, who have replaced the older generation of that time, owe it to our future warriors to learn from this tragic experience and avoid wars without purpose or focus.

Also, like every other Vietnam documentary, it excludes most of the war crimes committed, especially anything mentioning agent orange.

Ho Chi Minh was the George Washington of Vietnam during and after WWII, he was stab in the back by america, britian and france, allowing france to take back it's colony.  I'm not stupid and these war heroes who can't recognize that Vietnam wasn't going to be controlled by anyone, need to grow up.  There are DVD'S from the Vietnam point of view.  I visited Vietnam for my own personal history to see what the country was really like and why so many people had to die.  It reminds me of george w, bush and that idiot dick chaney creating two wars with two credit cards to finance it.
Vietnam was worth the trip and I would recommend that any veteran return if they can, the people were very generous and not at all resentful of the end outcome.  I was all over Saigon, Mekong Delta, Da Nang, Hue, Mi Son and Hanoi, I was able to see far more of Vietnam than the soldiers who had to fight to protect american business anf political interests and issues.  If you can't appreciate my point of view fine, I still meet with friends who served, there not critical of my point of view.  The soldier's being interviewed condemn Vietnam for the atrocities; every pilot dropping bombs from 20,000 feet was no more than a HOMECIDE BOMBER, and that includes J. MaCain.",1317168000,3,1666,4.411764705882353

I would recommend this for anyone interested in the Viet Nam war and anyone wanting to have a good overview of the way in which it was fought by those brave Americans. It would give those who do not understand what went on over there a good idea of just how brave those soldiers, airmen, marines, and sailors were.",1316736000,4,402,4.2631578947368425
3369600,4,B0014VPFPO,"During the war I was young (and immature) and didn't really understand all that was happening except for the nightly updates.
I found this film to be helpful in the chronological order of things. It also gave me new insights into the problematic duration of the war.  One being the change of four very different American presidents during this time. There never appeared to be a clear cut
plan on what the objective was except to kill as many NV as possible.  Very sad and harrowing to see what our fighting men and women went through and how the South Vietnamese were ""left"" to fend for themselves.",1291075200,12,599,4.588785046728972
3369601,4,B0014VPFPO,"I've read all the reviews, I've seem all the movies and Documentaries,nothing comes close to what Viet Nam was like for the Combat Vet. I served 3 tours in Viet Nam and what this does not show like all the others, was the smells and oders of the dead and dying ,that is something you can never forget or never describe. The true sounds of the war. What it felt like to see your best friend in pieces on the ground. I to was a Volenteer, and came back 3 times total, not because I loved it but I was young dumb and single. I really thought I could save a Dad with kids from going over. War is War I won't go into the details this missed or was right about it. When I came back from my last tour I was in the Hospital For over a Year. During the last few month I was able to leave the hospital for afew hours, that I loved , what I hated we were not allowed to wear our uniforms off base. Seems they were offencive to many of the locals. The things that went on in that country cost me alot , my first heart attack at 29, 3 bouts with cancer, at 61 I can bearly walk, but that is ok I am better off then many. For many many year I hate what the war did to me and others , I hated the way We were treated when we came home, I hate the fact that many more died after coming home from everything for cancer to taking their own lives. For year I could not stand watching how good the troops were treated when they were coming home from other wars, I felt cheat again, I was jealous. Two weeks ago that all changed. I was in a Fry's store (a supermarket ) It was Vetern's week so Had on a Viet Nam vet hat and shirt. I was standing looking at something and felt a light tapping on my back. I turn to find what looked to be a brother and sister maybe 7 to 8 years old, they looked up at me ( i could see just alittle fear in their eyes ). The little girl said to me ""Welcome Home and the Little boy put out his hand for me to shake and said to me "" Thank you for Serving "". I know it was the parents that told the kids what to do and say. I thanked them both with a salute and a thank you and spent the rest of my time in the store with tears in my eyes. That meant more to me then all the metals, everything. If you want to change a Vets life especially a Viet Nam Vet next time you see one please just take a second and say ""Welcome Home "" thank you for your time and to All Vets From All Wars, THANK YOU AND WELCOME HOME ,,,,,,,,,,",1290384000,83,2426,3.78698224852071

3369603,4,B0014VPFPO,"I remember seen the evening news on this topic. This is the war put in perspective and in detail. It looks more like a great news-magazine with plenty personal accounts. There are some limited comments on the politics of the time. And some limited evaluations of the strategic situation. Then, it occurs to me that may be there was no much strategy to talk about.  Anyway, I fell it was short on strategic and political perspectives. Perhaps that is why it is called ""inside"".",1253664000,2,476,4.666666666666667
3369604,5,B0014VPFPO,"This is the best Vietnam documentary I've seen so far. It is a good source of history on why the United States entered into that war and its consequences. The documentary narrates step by step from the beginning of the Vietnam war until its end in 1975 with excellent footage. I highly recommend it for all those who are interested in knowing the ""truth about this war.""",1252627200,21,370,4.537313432835821
3369605,5,B0014VPFPO,"Inside the Vietnam War is AN EXCELLENT FILM based on true and/or actual events that happen during a trying time in US history. Having a lot of friends and associates serve in the war gave me a better understanding of what actually happened and a disturbing opinion about the people behind the decision making in the white house.

However, more importantly, this film gave me a better perspective of the way the US media reported events and how they tried to manipulate US citizen's public opinion about this war. We should be outraged. The part of the film that showed Walter Cronkite indicating the TET offensive was a ""stalemate"" was treasonist. Although I do not remember the exact numbers, the body count of the offensive was overwhelmingly in favor of the Americans. Somewhere near 100,000 enemies killed to less than a thousand Americans. In addition, there was not one single offensive launched by the Vietcong (VC) and/or North Vietnam Army (NVA) that the American military did not overtake and win. NOT ONE. And this is undisputed.

In the end, war is HELL. But you go to war to win. And if successfully killing the enemy is an indication of winning the war, then the American military was overwhelmingly successful. The final numbers are mind-boggling; over 1.5 million VC/NVA (and unfortunately Vietnam citizens) to roughly 58,000 American military personnel.

We all should be proud of our American men and women in uniform. They did not ask to go there; they were told and given orders. They obeyed, did their job and did it well. We should be more worried about our decision makers and policy makers than our military.

This film should help everyone become more informative about this war.",1244073600,29,1704,4.885813148788928
