7962362,2,B000066NRU,"Ok so tonight I go to visit my friends and they happen to be watching this movie. At first it seemed alright, the beginning is probably the BEST part of the entire movie, then you start noticing things. Like the timing is off [meaning the sound does not match the action/speech of the film] and seeing that they used a Kung-Fu based plot I guess that could of been on purpose. Anyway as mentioned in almost all of the other reviews the acting is HORRIBLE. The plot is questionable, I think they had a good idea they just didn't take enough time to complete the thought. Anyway the film will make you laugh, I seriously think that ""Thug Life"" is the worst title this movie could have, it is more of a parody if you ask me, but anyway it is worth a watch at least for some laughs.",1292630400,,778,4.228187919463087
7962363,3,B000066NRU,"Watching this film brought back great memories of visiting the set and eventually being selected as an extra in this film.  It was made during the summer of 2000 here in Houston.  I knew some of the cast and crew members and just happened to visit them the night of the shoot when they told me about some film being made.  Anyway, it was this film.  I also didn't realize that I was in the same film with Napoleon (a member of the legendary 2Pac Outlaws group).  My high school classmate choreographed the kung fu moves and had a small cameo in the film as well.  I thought the acting was cool.  I did learn a lot of things while on the set.

As for the movie, itself:  after watching it, I thought that the acting could have used a little more work.  But, the film was still watchable and enjoyable.  I still watch it to this day and memories start flowing through my mind.  Give this film a try.  You might like it.  I certainly enjoyed being a part of it as well as liked it when I watched it.",1281484800,,996,4.146596858638744
7962364,4,B000066NRU,"The lead character is a straight negro. Notice i said negro. The story line is good. It's real! As far as the martial-arts experience? It's ideal. Though, none of these actors real seem to know martial arts. I do remember the days of the panther, where martial arts was part of the law. I mean you had to know how to defend yourself back then. This movie is a reminder of that. Though, it's not quite real enough it's still an ideal scenario. This would be a movie where grown ups have that child ""Conquer and destroy"" Mentality. Like ""This is our clubhouse! Who goes there?"" type ish (Ninja Turtles). So, it's cool in a way. I believe the kung fu master type action should be deaded and more official. As far as black folks? We just go for what we know. In the streets it ain't much. Um, maybe a crow-bar, a rock, a rusty screw-driver, umm some scrap metal........ Kung fu? how many of us can afforded? How many actually believe they need it? Mama got kitchen knives, Pops got a gun, big bro plays baseball. So their you have it. A good ideal movie with a lil extra activity that might take you from the concept. Though, it was fun to watch, and it makes me think...hmmmm what if black culture had more involved like Martial Art. But if you can look past the little martial arts slow motion fighting and the unexperience artists. You could really enjoy this flick heartful. Big ups to the team and cast that put this together cause it ain't too far off from the black origin. Always keep it real. Though this movie is straight entertainment. It's also one of my favorite underground indie films from black-america. Great Music! I imagine this movie redone with just ""Go for what you know fighting (on the real). It's Gangsta! Big Ups!",1071100800,3,1735,4.459119496855346
7962365,4,B000066NRU,it was an alright movie. I liked it because it took place in my hometown which is houston and its representing that shut em down records and thats my familys buisness,1056672000,,166,4.387096774193548
7962366,1,B000066NRU,"I saw this movie on TMC one night......First off I'd like to say, ""Who in the hell keeps making these types movies"" It attracted me because it had ""the Lady of Rage"" in it. too much cursing, no real plot and just a bad script. Two friends from the Hood who seem to be martial arts experts. who are into all the bad things the Hood has to offer. I thought martial arts was to supossed to keep you out of trouble!",1054080000,,411,4.024390243902439
7962367,4,B000066NRU,"It was ok not very good description of life here in Houston, but worth watching thinks to the characters Boo, and Mecca. It's about a Boo an ex street thug helping a friend out and getting caught up in a gang rivalry, along with a murder and having to try to survive life in the south while trying to escape.",1016150400,2,308,4.15
7962368,3,B000066NRU,"Well, I bought this movie for the simple fact that it had ""THUG LIFE"" on the front of the box. I didn't read the back of the box or anything I just got it cuz it said ""Thug Life."" Well, I watched the movie and I think that it's alright, it don't live up to Thug Life movies like Boyz in tha Hood or Menace II Society but it's alright. I recommend you rent this movie first and you decide to buy it.",992476800,,398,3.8072289156626504
