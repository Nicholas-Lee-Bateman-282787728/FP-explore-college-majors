Expected much more from the way this set was promoted....  Sign me, ""Disappointed"".",1315526400,7,246,5.54054054054054
8459173,2,B0056486RE,"Despite acceptable cinematography here and there, Doug Phillips has little of substance to say in these 300 minutes; and sometimes what he does say is downright embarrassingsuch as his gushing over the Ica Stones, almost certainly modern hoaxes.  Perhaps a decent 58-minute film could have been cobbled together from this material; but as it is, this four-video set is without form and void.",1451433600,,391,5.2063492063492065
8459174,1,B0056486RE,"If you want to see one man's face for hours and hours, and listen to him constantly, without seeing much of the beauty of the Amazon jungle, then this is the movie for you.  I gave up after fast forwarding two of the DVDs and have no desire to see the rest.",1441670400,2,257,3.9423076923076925
8459175,5,B0056486RE,"I am more than excited to launch into this series about the Amazon, for this part of our world is just breathtakingly an explorer's dream.  I have always had a desire to travel to this unique part of South America to not only see all the animals, but the numerous people groups that call it their home.",1431820800,,302,4.298245614035087
8459176,1,B0056486RE,"What a disappointment!  Our whole family sat down to watch what we thought would be an exciting adventure film about the Amazon.  However, this film turned out to be Doug Phillips standing in front of a tree in the Amazon giving what seemed like a sermon.  There was very little filming of the actual Amazon, the camera seemed to be soley on Doug Phillips the whole time, which made for a very boring film!  This would have been much better if there had been more scenes of God's creation with beautiful music....less talking/lecturing and more scenery!  I think we'll stick with Planet Earth.  I would not recommend buying this, it was a waste of money.",1380931200,6,654,4.643478260869565
8459177,5,B0056486RE,This is a beautifully produced set of videos on the Amazon from Vision Forum. I thoroughly enjoyed watching as did my husband and children. My youngest is eight and she enjoyed it as much as my sixteen year old did. I found it to be an enlightening look into a whole different world!,1380067200,,283,4.3584905660377355
8459178,3,B0056486RE,"""Into the Amazon"" follows a tour group of 30 men as they explore the Amazon, the Inca Stones, Great Peruvian Desert, the Nazca lines, and Machu Picchu. The visual was nicely done overall, but sometimes the audio was difficult to hear due to people in the background making noise or when the sound dropped when those speaking turned their head or moved too fast.

The focus of the series was primarily ""biblical dominion versus radial environmentalism."" Don't expect a creation science focus, though the speakers do come from a biblical viewpoint.

The first disc contained the episodes:
""The Mystery of the Meaning of the Amazon"" (15 minutes and 35 seconds) and ""The Mystery of the Lost Legacy of Adventure & Dominion--Part One and Two"" (22 minutes 34 seconds). This disc was mainly aimed at men. Much of it was Doug Phillips standing in front of a tree giving a lecture on some of the history of the exploration of the Amazon and on what he feels is the biblical view of dominion and adventure. (What he qualifies as dominion and adventure seemed very narrowly defined to me.) It also included the group hiking in the Amazon and not turning back soon enough. They ended up lost in the dark and, after having fun being lost for a while, they finally used their GPS to get home.

The second disc contained the episodes:
""The Mystery of the Strange Creatures of the Amazon"" (34 minutes) which showed some captive animals up close, then we follow their trips out to find some wild animals. They were successful at finding monkeys and cave bats but not at finding anacondas. In ""The Mystery of the Plants of the Amazon"" (22 minutes), we're shown a variety of plants and told how they are used medically by the locals. In ""The Mystery of the Lost Tribes (21 minutes, 21 seconds), we learn about remote Amazon tribes and about missionary efforts to these tribes. We follow the group as they go to a remote village to offer a medical clinic (though we only briefly see the medical clinic).

The third disc contained the episodes:
""The Mystery of the Inca Stones, the Nazca Lines, and the Great Peruvian Desert"" (25 minutes 9 seconds) which follows the tour group as they study the Inca Stone collection and discuss them, fly over the Nazca Lines and discuss them, and play in the Great Peruvian Desert and look for whale bones there. ""The Mystery of Machu Picchu"" (29 minutes 38 seconds) gave a detailed tour of Machu Picchu. While Doug Phillips stated some things as fact that archaeologists don't all agree on, he did a nice job of showing the viewer all over Machu Picchu. This disc was more what I had been expecting of the whole series, and I enjoyed it a lot.

The fourth disc contained some bonus clips of other things they saw (mainly things in the cities they went through) and episode trailers.",1354233600,6,2797,4.642424242424243
8459179,5,B0056486RE,"I thought it was beautifully done. I lived in Central America for a time and it transported me back. There was respect for the cultures and information about ancient peoples I had never heard before. My 9-year-old watched for a while, but in general I'd say this is more for 12-year-olds and up.",1353715200,4,295,4.584905660377358
8459180,1,B0056486RE,"Just another VF product with Philips exercising his dominion of the screen. Would have enjoyed seeing more of the 'adventure' and hearing a lot less lecture. After about 1 hour, my kids switched back to 'Planet Earth'. I'd much rather point out the evolutionary fallacies of the BBC than endure self-inflated lecture and novice videography.",1341532800,7,340,5.2
8459181,1,B0056486RE,"I have longed to see the Amazon through the eyes of Christian creationists for a very long time. But this movie was a huge let down. I plan on traveling to Peru one day, but I'm not learning much that will help me from this movie. The movie commentator is overly excited about every little thing, but there is not much substance to the movie. Honestly, I felt like perhaps I should have watched something from the discovery channel and gained way more.",1335744000,9,452,4.457831325301205
8459182,5,B0056486RE,"I'm going to borrow part of ""Andrew's"" review because it is exactly how I feel about this documentary.

Andrew wrote: ""This is a wonderful educational film for the whole family. The best part is that it is NOT another evolutionary, environmental propaganda piece, but is based on a biblical worldview.""

I completely agree!!!!

Though it is true, that there is a small portion of the documentary that the audio is weak for a few minutes due to the weather conditions it is no way diminishes the whole set!

It is a great addition to HSing. Enhance it with some wonderful online or book photography and it's a great way to make a lapbook, and/or a oral or written report.

I do not regret purchasing this at all. Wonderfully instructional!",1318982400,11,738,4.689922480620155
