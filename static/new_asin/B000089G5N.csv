* Synopsis *
========
<Out of the Past (Part 1)>
Wolverines former love, Yuriko, comes to seek revenge because she thinks he caused her fathers death.
<Out of the Past (Part 2)>
The X Men stop Yuriko from killing Wolverine.
<Nightcrawler>
Gambit, Rogue, and Wolverine take a ski trip in Germany for some much-needed R & R. While Gambit and Rogue seem to be enjoying themselves, Wolverine is restless, and longs for some action. When he hears reports of a demon hiding in a local monastery, his investigation reveals not a demon, but a mutant, Nightcrawler, whose devilish appearance is in stark contrast to his peaceful and deeply philosophical nature. While the X-Men convince the townsfolk not to fear what they do not understand, Wolverine, too, learns something about the nature of faith.
<The Lotus and the Steel>
Wolverine, losing control, quits the X-Men to return to rural Japan, site of happier times, in an effort to find himself. He works peacefully with a former spiritual teacher, the monk Oku, to build a temple. But the neighboring village is about to be attacked by bandits, led by the merciless Silver Samurai, unless payment is made. Some of the villagers want to resist, and ask Wolverine for help. Wolverine is torn. This is just the sort of thing he had wanted to leave behind. Meanwhile, Jubilee, blaming herself for Wolverine's abrupt departure, is searching rural Japan for him.
<The Final Decision>
Recovering from their initial battle with the X-Men, Gyrich and Trask have resumed Project Wideawake by creating the ultimate Sentinel: the Master Mold, a walking factory capable of creating Sentinel robots at an assembly-line pace. The X-Men must join with their oldest nemesis, Magneto, to destroy the Master Mold and prevent the extermination of all mutantkind.",1051574400,8,2034,4.950292397660819
1831600,5,B000089G5N,"This DVD featuring the best of 1990s X-Men cartoons about Wolverine contains a great selection of cartoon.  I love 1990s Marvel cartoons because they actually remain true to the comic itself for the most part.  What is this Evolution crud?  Anyway, I just think they should come out with all of the seasons of the 1990s X-Men cartoon.  And while they're at it, they should come out with all the Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, and Hulk cartoons from the 90s. Come on Marvel! Stop depriving us of what's rightfully ours.  We buy your wonderful comics and your...ugh movies (Hulk, X-2, Fantastic Four) to name a few, just give us our seasons once and for all...that's an order!",1122336000,4,671,4.75
1831601,5,B000089G5N,"I would love this dvd collection of X-Mens: Wolverine. It's talking about his life on how he became a mutant, this dvd has five episodes. The 90's cartoons had some good drawings on American cartoons and it's not even anime.",1118707200,,224,4.625
1831602,4,B000089G5N,"As a kid I enjoyed watching X-Men with my brother, those were the good old days... My brother's friend, who is a Marvel nerd, let us borrow this, and we enjoyed watching one of our favorite cartoons from the past!

You must be warned though, ""Nightcrawler"" is the only episode not dealing with Wolverine. He just argues with eceryone and *SPOILER* decides to pray more and read the Bible.

I reccomend you buy this one if you like the 90's X-Men to enjoy the good times again.",1107648000,,476,4.459770114942529
1831603,4,B000089G5N,"""The Chris Claremont interview shows what a dull/uninventive writer he really is. I'm glad he's not involved with the X-Men movies in any way. Only Stan Lee is."" -A Viewer (See below)

Is he kidding?  Not only is Chris Claremont CURRENTLY writing Uncanny X-men, he's also the best writer they ever had, penning for example a funny little tale called THE PHOENIX SAGA!  Which X-Men 3 is going to be based on!! Stan Lee's great, but Chris Claremont did for X-Men what Miller did for Daredevil... he brought them to the next level.

I agree with the other reviews that this show was great, but why are they giving them to us bit by bit?  X-Men is the most popular comic of all time, and this show is arguably as good as Batman's show, if in different ways.  They are releasing Batman properly, so why not X-Men?",1101686400,6,808,4.462585034013605
1831604,3,B000089G5N,"I bought this DVD, it generally was good, however it's sopposed to be about the history of WOLVERINE, not his ""currrent"" adventures... the WWII episode would have been better & some of the other Weapon X and Sabretooth oriented episodes would have been welcomed, personally I WOULD KILL(literally) for a boxed set of all 76(or so) episodes, in their entirety on DVD... that would make the greatest Chirstmas gift ever, now that's an X-FANS dream come true!!",1080086400,11,457,4.9480519480519485
1831605,3,B000089G5N,"The video quality is about an 8 at best.  Chris Claremont's commentary often has nothing to do with what you're seeing on screen.  ""The Lotus and the Steel"" is somewhat boring, and ""Out of the Past"" isn't all that interesting either.  So what's good about this DVD?  First of all, ""Nightcrawler"" and second, the bonus feature ""The Final Decision.""  If you were a big fan of the 90s TV series (like me), then by all means get this DVD. Just shop around first ;-)",1060992000,4,461,4.440476190476191
1831606,4,B000089G5N,"I like these episodes. In fact the bonus episode The Final Decision may be one of the best X-men episodes, but come on. I wish they'd start releasing the whole series on DVD. The way they've done it, they're just teasing all of the fans out there. Throwing us a bone every now and then.
I think there were probably some episodes that might have given us more insight into Wolverine than some of these did. Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape would have been a good one, but They're still good episodes. I love the commentary. It's very good, although he could be a little more relevant at times. I'd say over all it's an excellent DVD, picture and sound are great. It's just too little, but it's not too late. If they'd get a TV station to start showing this again, peak some interest in the young kids, they could sell the whole series on DVD and it would sell great. It's one of the greatest cartoon series of all time and they should market it more.",1055980800,3,946,4.320224719101123
1831607,4,B000089G5N,"After seeing X2, my interest in X-Men once again came alive.  This DVD is great.  They picked some very good episodes from the cartoon series and it felt very nostalgic.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was because another episode or 2 would have been appreciated.",1052438400,,262,4.416666666666667
1831608,4,B000089G5N,"The collection of cartoons from the X-Men cartoon series includes:
""Out of the Past-Parts I & II""  These two episodes explore the origins of Wolverine and explain how his former love became a hated nemesis, the feared Lady Deathstrike.
""Nightcrawler""  This episode of the series introduces the X-Men to the mutant of faith, Nightcrawler.
""The Lotus and the Steel""  Taking a plot directly from THE SEVEN SAMURI, Wolverine leaves the X-Men and goes to Japan in order to find inner peace. He finds instead is a village under the reign of a gang of terror and discovers that in order to find peace with the world, one must find peace with one's self first.
This DVD also includes the bonus episode:
""X-Men: The Final Decision""  The X-Men join forces with Magneto to prevent the collapse of all mankind, mutants and non-mutants alike.
The DVD also includes an interview with X-Men writer, Chris Claremont; Chris Claremont's talk about each of the episodes on the DVD; and a brief interview with Stan Lee.
I enjoyed watching each one of these cartoons. They work well as an introduction to the X-Men (especially Wolverine and Nightcrawler) and are full of action. The interviews with Chris Claremont and Stan Lee are especially interesting and full of nuggets of Marvel trivia. A nice collection for a fan of the X-Men or for someone interesting in learning more about this superhero team.",1052352000,11,1383,4.872340425531915
1831609,5,B000089G5N,"This collection has my favorite episode of all times. The one with Nitecrawler. It is without a doubt one of the most frank dealings with christianity I have ever seen in all my times in comics. I mean Kurt hands Logan a bible for goodness sake. This dvd is worth the money for that 1 espisode alone. On the down side I'd rather have these episodes released 1 season at a time. Oh and there's no mention of ""Cold Vengence"" which is probably one of the best X-men cartoons ever.",1051833600,,477,4.311111111111111

7980664,1,B000089G5N,"This is exactly why Amazon needs to make a deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment. This is one of my favorite cartoons as a child, this release only has a few episodes, and not very good ones either. WE NEED FULL SEASON BOXSETS OF THIS SHOW AMAZON, PLEASE! Buena Vista Home Entertainment has the rights to this show, and they simply refuse to release it on Season boxsets. You did a good job by getting Nickelodeon shows, please try to make a deal with them. I know that it would sell.",1222819200,,487,4.362637362637362
7980665,5,B000089G5N,"I've adored this show since the '90s and these are some great episodes--some weird alien ship and something that eats people's consciousness, one about Nightcrawler, some Wolverine claw action, and one about the Sentinels and Master Mold.  ""That is illogical.  Mutants ARE humans!""

Great stuff, but please, put out the box sets!  People will buy it, I can assure you!  It'll be #1 on my get list!  PUT OUT THE BOX SETS!!!!  PLEEEEASE!!  PLEEEASE!!",1179187200,,448,4.95945945945946
7980666,5,B000089G5N,"First of all, this collection has nothing to do with the legend of Wolverine. We X-men fans deserve better! So many episodes were released on tape but few on DvD. They need to release each season. The is stories are great,animation is acceptable and wondeful voice acting! Please, don't let us wait any longer! Better for them to realease this out on dvd!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Savage-Land-Strange-Heart-Dark-Phoenix-Special-Edition/dp/B00004Y563/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men - Savage Land/Strange Heart/Dark Phoenix - Special Edition</a>",1178928000,,601,7.135135135135135
7980667,1,B000089G5N,I want to know when they will release an entire season of the X-Men series. They did it with thundercats and its about time they should do it for X-men. This was an amazing series that I wish I could own and they don't seem to be putting it out correctly. I don't think I will be buying any intallments of the X-men series until they come out with entire seasons of them. I think someone should start a petition because I think thats what got the Thundercats series on dvd.,1148860800,9,473,4.208791208791209
