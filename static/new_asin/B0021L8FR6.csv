3835943,5,B0021L8FR6,"LOST is one of those rare TV shows that come around once a decade.  I was hoping for a good deal on a ""Complete Season"" Blu-Ray set but did not expect this deal!  I am glad I checked Slickdeals dot net tonight...  If you have never watched Lost and LOVE briliant writing, intriguing characters and great acting (also great HD!) then BUY THIS SET NOW!  At this price ($108) it is a steal for the amount of entertainment you will get.

I am not your typical TV series fanatic and I rarely get ""caught up"" in a series.  LOST hooked me from day one in Sept. 2004 and I have never looked back... (or have I?...)  ;-)",1260230400,,611,4.170940170940171
3835944,5,B0021L8FR6,"My husband is a big fan of the Lost series, I missed the first few seasons and have felt left out ever since! So now this was my opportunity to get caught up! Hooray! Thanks Amazon!",1260230400,,181,4.055555555555555
3835945,5,B0021L8FR6,You have to be crazy not to get this disc set at that great price. The show is shot so wonderfully and in HD it is even better. The price makes it a no-Brainer. If you're a fan of this show its a must own!,1260230400,,205,3.577777777777778
3835946,5,B0021L8FR6,uummm...Mine mine mine. This is amazing. All I have to say is Lost. Its all you need to know and the price blows my mind.,1260230400,2,121,3.88
3835947,5,B0021L8FR6,"Everyone should be aware that there is NOTHING in this set that's not in the individual edition. Each of the seasons in its separate box, shrink-wrapped and sealed.

Anyone who already has the individual seasons should have no reason to get this unless they wish to upgrade from DVD to Blu. Those who don't have LOST yet, this should the right set to buy or... wait until the 6-seasons sets become available next year.

To me, LOST is the best TV series of the third millennium, so far. In fact, I am very surprised that a TV series could be made this good these days when cost cutting and declining standards seem to be the norm everywhere else. But, not in the world of television, it seems. Or, rather, LOST and a couple other shows (Heroes is another favorite of mine) happen to be the exception.

LOST employs a cast of dozens to tell a big story. How big the story is? Well... five years and it's still going so... it's big. Slowly, what begins as your run of the mill airliner crash survivors story keeps adding layers on top of layers, expands, branches out in unexpected directions and, episode after episode after episode keeps us mesmerized, guessing, mourning those lost and left behind, surprised, intrigued and always ready for more. 100 episodes later and we are used to expect the unexpected now. I will not reveal the plot but it's probably proper to note that you are going to see peoples struggling to overcome extreme circumstances, stories of friendship, love, solidarity, spontaneous cooperation, the inevitable conflicts between people of many different upbringings, chasing different dreams, sometimes competing for the same rewards. Facing danger, the unknown and, what appears to be the incomprehensible, the initial state of anarchy spontaneously gains textures and a fragile structures are formed only to unravel or morph into something else.

LOST has an incredibly well-written story line, great acting and it's shown to us in the highest quality picture and sound. It is, without a doubt, one of the best TV series I've watched in a long, long time. If you haven't watched the weekly episodes on TV, you should consider yourself lucky. I haven't either and I am glad I didn't have to wait, week after week, for yet another mystery to solve itself in the next episodes. We are very likely to go through the first five seasons at least once, possibly twice before season six is released.

Oh, and, one more thing that you should keep in mind - but you will constantly fail at it: NOTHING is what what it seems to be and nobody is what he/she claims to be.

Happy viewing :)

As a frame of reference, this set was available at Amazon for ONE day, on Dec. 9, 2009, for 108.99. I am highly doubtful that such an opportunity will present itself again until maybe next year when the 6-seasons set could be made available for one day or a for a few hour at a comparatively great price.",1260230400,26,2953,4.75390625
3835948,5,B0021L8FR6,"hello, good night, best series in the world, of all time really do not know what happened in the season finale but I'm sure will be impressive, I must know if the season include captions in Portuguese, Spanish or German, thanks I hope I clarified doubt.",1259280000,2,253,4.521739130434782
3835949,4,B0021L8FR6,"I have been a fan from the start. I have enjoyed the show and look forward to each season. I have to say that season 3 & 4 were a bit slow. Season 5 was great! The story line is all in order and flows smoothly from season to season. I can't wait for season 6. I have the first 4 seasons on DVD, not opened yet. I want to wait until the release of season 6 and watch all 6 seasons back to back-to-back etc until the end. A marathon if you will.

To explain what the show is about would take more time than I would care to write or read. Characters are well developed, and move freely with the story line. Some die and are dropped from the story line, but they die to carry the story line further, to the next steps.

If you are interested in the show, watch it from the beginning to get the full effect.",1259280000,,802,3.914110429447853
3835950,5,B0021L8FR6,"This is one of the best shows on TV. Every season seems to get better and better. If you want a great show to get into...this is the show. It's full of great acting, well thought out plot lines, intense suspense and a great cast. This show will make you want to watch more. Can't wait for every ""hole"" to be revealed in season 6.",1257465600,3,329,4.076923076923077
3835951,5,B0021L8FR6,"I don't agree with the first review. It's a lot to easy just to define LOST as an ongoing mystery-TV-show that does not answer questions!

First of all, one of the most important questions ""dude, where are we?"" that was asked in the pilot, has not been answered yet and this is so for a good reason (we know what happened with TWIN PEAKS when the murderer was revealed...).

Second, LOST has always been from Season 1 about mysteries. Very often answers were given, but the fans sometimes didn't even appreciate the answering of questions (or maybe it was not the answer they expected). Personally, I cannot think of any other TV-show that changes so dramatically from Season to Season. Normally TV-shows are really repetitive and have the same themes everey season. In LOST however, and this is true for all seasons (except maybe the fourth one) the audience can't actually tell when, where and how the show is going to continue. We didn't really know the content of the hatch, we didn't know what would happen to Desmond at the end of S2, how did the Losties get back to the main land? Why did John Locke die (we got the answer to that, but many fans didn't appreciate that answer!), where did the Island go? And now after Season 5: What happened to Jacob? Where did the Losties go? Now if you don't like to think and if you prefer some lame and boring TV-show then LOST is simply not your thing. Quentin Tarantino once said: You don't go to a metallica concert and tell the fu...rs to turn the volume down.

We must not forget that the producers of LOST wanted to tell a very specific story from the very beginning. The two skeletons are absolutely crucial, Carlton Cuse stated in an interview that when LOST will be told the Skeletons in Season 1 will be the proof that they knew from the very beginning what the story was going to be they wanted to tell and they did not make it up while telling! I think it is not fair to judge theoverall  quality of LOST when the story is not told to the end. Let's just wait and see how they are going to blow us away with Season 6. I can't tell you why, but from the bottom of my heart I know that Season 6 ist going to be the most awe-inspiring and breath-taking Seson in the overall history of LOST. When LOTS has ended the greatest TV-show in the history of television will have ended!",1257033600,8,2331,4.3764434180138565

3836047,1,B0021L8FR6,"If you saw my previous review of Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan seen here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FA87HDS0M80G/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J97P8ZW&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=2858778011&store=instant-video you'll notice that I didn't complain about giving it one star because it at least deserved one because Dom was hosting it and it has one of his biggest and most well-known passions. Dominic Monaghan should NEVER have been on Lost because for one his character was a huge asset to the story line and should never have died in the first place. Lost is what I like to call the utmost in cheese!!! Of course, Emilie DeRavin shouldn't have been on Lost either, basically because she can't act her way out of a paper sack. They gave her the role the pregnant ho for a reason, it's easy for her pea-sized brain to understand. It was obvious she has trouble memorizing lines. And don't tell me it was a bad script, girl. You should try your hand at being the porn star who invites the mailman over to rub peanut butter all over her. Yuck! Anyway! They should've killed her off after she had her baby.

Jack: Claire. OMG! She's hyperventilating. Charlie, do something! Please.

Charlie: *shrugs* Eh, she was a bad actress anyway.

Jack: CHARLIE!?!?!?

Charlie: I'm gonna go help Hurley catch fish. *wanders off to help Hurley*

That scene alone would make the show watchable. And what is it with the number obsession! Did someone with by bipolar disorder write this script??? Seriously! My ex-husband was bipolar so yes, he could've wrote the script to Lost. Then he would've better contributed as a husband. Nah, then I would've ran into Dom too soon and left my husband. So nah, it was meant to happen this way.

Anyhow, Lost holds up to its name so you gotta give it credit for that at least. Wanna see a kick ass T.V. series that should've lasted much longer? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441135/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Lost should've been kicked to the curb after the 1st season. But, J.J. Abrams was nice enough to torture us for five gut-wrenching seasons. Thank you! Never experienced suicidal thoughts before? Watch Lost. I guarantee you will after that!",1435795200,,2169,5.1303116147308785

3836095,5,B0021L8FR6,"after the 3rd season the show lost its edge, I feel they focused too much on closing up the story.  Great music, great scenery, great graphics, wonderful characters, but I think the writing was rushed after season 3. I wish they had taken the time to flesh everything out before filming, worked through all the logic and details, and then began production. But even though it was rushed, this was an epic adventure I am so glad I didn't miss.",1394064000,,442,4.525
3836096,2,B0021L8FR6,"I unfortunately bought the whole series without seeing much of it on TV. Very shallow and sloppy script writing and I still do not know what the plot was. There were so many loose ends, forward and flashbacks, it was hard to figure out WTF was going on after season one . I hoped that Terry O' Quinn would be able to save the series...not. His character did sort of follow the ""Peter"" character in Millennium, but with the backdrop of other characters, his task was impossible.

I know it is fictional TV, but there was little technical accuracy. No way are you going to ""stitch"" someone up with a needle and thread, much less walk someone through an appendectomy. The political correctness was in your face, including the interracial marriage, all ethnicities represented, an obese glutton with an eating disorder, and WWII guns with 10 round magazines only.

I tried to watch it a second time, because I fell asleep during many of the episodes. Yes, it was that bad. I think I will wind up selling it back to Amazon. Whatever happened to network shows and writers like Steven Bochco of St. Elsewhere and Hill Street Blues?",1390521600,,1124,4.64321608040201

She is much sharper then I am and she is getting it.  This is my favorite TV show along with West Wing.  My favorite episode is ""Tricia Tanaka Is Dead""  Q.V. Shambala - Three Dog Night""...  I'm'a thinking you have to be a pentagenerian to really appreciate all that I just offered...  Anyway Lost seasons 1 through SIX are great television...",1385942400,,514,4.582417582417582

3836100,5,B0021L8FR6,I watched Lost on Netflix and had to purchase it have for my own if that tells you how good this series is. It will leave you confused and wondering but in a good way. I highly recommend this purchase!,1369094400,,201,4.05

3836102,5,B0021L8FR6,"My family of five started watching LOST on DVD last Nov or Dec (2012) and only one of us had EVER seen Lost before. I never watched it EVER when it was on TV but my husband did (wasn't my husband then) and when we married in 2011 he BEGGED me to watch the LOST seasons with him but I didn't buy into all the hype back when it was on and didn't want to start now.

But I gave it more thought and I decided to go ahead and ""try"" and see if I could ""get through"" the first few episodes before telling him ""well I tried and it's just not that good"". Well, I was WRONG!!!! I could not believe how HOOKED my girls and I got from the very first episode and we still are! We cannot get enough of LOST. My 17 year old loves it and my 13 year old is absolutely obsessed with it!! She even started watching it from the very first episode ALL OVER AGAIN during times we aren't watching where we currently are at!! She's on Season 3 on her ""own time"" while we all watch it together.

We have watched Season 1-5 now with last night being the finale of season 5. We are VERY sad that season 6 is upon us already and will be very sad when we're all caught up and we're done. I bought season 3-6 on Amazon and I am SOOO glad I did!! I HOPE you will watch every single episode of LOST and give it a chance. We think it is the BEST show we have EVER seen!!

Heck, I even dream about it pretty much every night. The only thing I don't like is that there aren't enough episodes in season 5 and 6!!!! I cannot recommend LOST highly enough! There just isn't enough ""stars"" available to rate this show!!! You will fall in LOVE with the characters (we LOVE to list our favorite characters IN ORDER and discuss why and what's going on during each episode), LOVE the plot, LOVE the scenery, LOVE the humor!!! LOVE the whole CONCEPT of the show and LOVE LOVE LOVE being engrossed in it!!!!! Thank God we can pause the Blu Ray player because we always have to pause it and go ""no way!!! what!?!"" and discuss what is going on!! It is SOOOO exciting!!!!!!",1359849600,,2024,4.055

My kids enjoyed them so much, I decided to buy them all the seasons for Christmas. I sat down to watch 1 show with them and I was hooked! After work and for a couple weeks, we would sit there and watch show after show. So nice not to have to deal with commercials and waiting the next week for an episode to come out.

3836498,5,B0021L8FR6,"Well I am 15, and I had never watched the series before. I've always seen previws and tv ads for it, but I never took the time to watch it. After I noticed that the last season was going to air,
I said *Maybe now is great time to start watching LOST, and catch the last season when it comes to Blu-Ray* (the high definition is incredible, and the product was in excellent conditions when
I recieved it, of you have a Blu-Ray player or PS3, definetly get it on Blu Ray).
  Let me tell you that for a teenager it is weird, not to catch this type of series. It mixes the intrigue and the  sense of suspense perfectly, which makes it a remarkable tv show compered to
the trash that is out there.
The show starts with the catastrophic plane crash, and it gets more and more interesting with every episode that you watch. Many questions are raised and later answered, but  it never
looses its sense of suspense and adventure.
Now, looking at the cast and main roles in this series, you can say that they are put together perfectly, and they really improve as the series moves on.
Matthew Fox leads the series as Jack Shephard, and he really delivers a sense of leadership and command with the development of his character and the series.
The other actors deliver remarkable performances in every episode. Every episode focuses on one certain character and we are introduced to their back stories and how everything is connected
between them.
Take John Locke for example. He seems to have a strange connection with the island and nature, as he always brings something new to the table. ( Excellent performance by the way. )

Overall this series is a masterpiece of television. It might have its up and downs, but it really delivers what the viewer is expecting to watch.
This package containing the first 5 seasons, is delivered with excellent quality and gives a you a long time to get lost in the world of LOST.",1268524800,,1906,4.497109826589595

I ordered this set from someone I thought was a trustworthy seller here in the Amazon Marketplace. But when I got the DVDs I had been sold some international edition of the show. They were not the U.S. DVDs. The episodes seemed to be the same and in English but the box art was not. And the season 5 DVD menu was in some Asian language. I didn't even know how to start the DVD because I couldn't read anything. It took an e-mail to the seller demanding a refund and some help from Amazon to resolve the issue. My point is, be sure to communicate with the seller to make sure you are not getting some bootleg or international edition. It seems more commonplace now and it has happened to me twice here on Amazon. The show itself is worth buying and watching. Just be careful who you buy from.",1267315200,3,873,4.233532934131737

3836596,5,B0021L8FR6,"This is definately my favorite show from the past decade, just when I thought Network T.V. had become reality T.V., ABC/Disney cranks out this one, there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, except to give my viewpoint, what I think makes this show appealing is the characters from all walks of life coming together for a simple cause, to stay alive & hope for rescue, to me characters drive a show to its success, characters have always driven every successful show, if you don't care about the characters, you won't care about the show simply put... now on to the review...

Season 1>>>>  is by far the season where you get to know everyone, the mystery surrounding the island was definately original, & in this season we get a glimpse of who everyone is or was, before & after the plane crash, this season really defined the characters like it needed too, we are introduced to Jack(doctor), Kate(running from the law), Sawyer(con man), Hurley(recent lotto winner), Locke(handicapped & down on his luck until now), Sayid(former Iraqi soldier), Michael(single father), Sun & Jinn(married Japenese couple), Boone & Shannon (brother & sister), Claire(pregnant woman), Charlie(rock star), & others who crashed on the other side of the island Michelle(former cop) & Mr. Ecko(former drug runner, now preacher), again all walks of life are here, there is also a smoke monster/presence, polar bears, signal tower, a dead man walking, a hatch underground, a mysterious french woman & many other mysteries

Season 2>>> To me this one is even better than 1, because now we get to the heart of what the island may or may not be, this one centers on the infamous Hatch, which was definately original that apparently has been occupied by many who have to push buttons to keep a series of chain reactions that are not quite made clear until later seasons from happening, Desmond is a new character who gets introduced who is currently overseeing the Hatch, we also meet the others who are not what they appear to be & we meet Ben, who becomes the castaways antagonist in more ways than one

Season 3>>> Despite what many people felt about this one, it was on par with the first two seasons, yes, some unanswered questions got answered, but we found out who the others were, & we got introduced to Juliett who many viewers I think despised at first, but later warmed up to, this season's end finally sees a rescue, but what kind of rescue we all wondered.

Season 4>>> To me, this one was a departure from the mystery angle of the first 3 seasons, this one mainly concentrated on the rescue attempt that we learned had not been in the best interest of the castaways as more mysteries came to light, such as why they were never rescued sooner & how a billionaire had faked the plane crash under water claiming no survivors to the world while at the same time trying to silence anyone & everyone on the island by sending ruthless mercenaries to continue his cover-up, this one was a bit more violent than the previous 3 seasons, & its ending is where this show started to get more complex than ever as Ben is able to make the island disappear by moving it in an attempt to keep it safe, while six of the castaways (Jack, Kate, Sayid, Hurley, Sun, & Claire's child) make it to society & are rescued, but later realize that their lives on the island are far from over

Season 5>>> After Ben moves the island, the survivors find themselves moving through time, don't get me wrong, I like time-travel stories just as much as the next guy, but where it fits here, I don't know, Locke, Sawyer, Juliett, Jinn, Faraday, & others find themselves moving through time to 1954 to 2004 to 1974 & so on, Jinn even ends up in 1988 where he meets the younger french woman, this one is by far the most confusing one that can only be resolved in Season 6, we also finally meet Jacob who was so talked about in the previous seasons.

again, there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, but this is by far one of the most innovative a creative shows ever made, if you haven't watched it, then you are missing out on some great stuff here!!",1265846400,,4131,4.574324324324325

3836599,5,B0021L8FR6,"It's a vast mass of mysteries, bizarre twists and supernatural occurrences -- and it's brilliant.  ""Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5"" has some bumps along its way (particularly in the second season), but it blossoms once it finds its footing, and starts working towards a brain-bending, epic clash between the forces of light and darkness. Think of it as ""Swiss Family Robinson"" by way of Stephen King.

A plane crashes on a remote tropical island, leaving a terrified band of survivors including a doctor named Jack (Matthew Fox), a spoiled brother and sister, a single dad and his strange son, an Iraqi ex-soldier, a Korean couple, chubby lottery winner, an escaped prisoner, a hostile con-man, a man cured of paralysis, and a junkie rocker.

Unfortunately, the island has countless perils that crop up as the survivors try to survive there, and strange people are hidden in its depths. What's more, the island has a history that stretches back countless years -- there are remnants of a powerful organization called Dharma, a collection of ""Others"" living in a luxurious modern village, a metal hatch with a button that MUST be pushed, and ancient statues and temples from ancient times.

The survivors do their best to keep alive and to fight back the Others, but they lose many of their number -- and when a small band of them do escape, they find that they have somehow disrupted the island's primal forces, and the fabric of time itself. But even when they fight their way back to the island, they find that not all is as it should be -- and in an effort to set things right once and for all, they must take the ultimate risk and set off a terrifying series of events...

Yes, it's a weird show -- ""Lost"" might make more sense if you're drunk or stoned, because it can swing wildly from the downright surreal to the mundane. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one. J.J. Adams, best known for ""Alias,"" outdoes his first hit TV show with something totally different -- not just from his past work, but from everything else on TV.

The gorgeous Hawaiian landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline, although the writers do stumble occasionally (the first half of the second season is a total misfire). Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense, and he twines together dozens of mysteries -- the island's nature, its prior inhabitants, and its countless mysteries. Some mysteries have been answered, and some are left dangling for the sixth and final season -- and every time Adams unravels one puzzle, it just reveals a new one.

And ""Lost"" is truly an ensemble show -- every character gets to shine (including some we don't care about), and flashbacks (and flash-forwards) reveal what makes them tick. And some, like Jin, Sun and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer are evolved far beyond their original characterization.

Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor... even though the self-righteous Jack eventually gets kind of annoying. Fotunately, there's a brilliant supporting cast -- Dominic Monaghan, Jorge Garcia (""Dude, that was a Jedi moment!""), Terry O'Quinn, Evangeline Lilly, the brilliant Naveen Andrews and Josh Holloway, Yunjin Kim, Elizabeth Mitchell, Daniel Dae Kim. Two brilliant supporting roles are Michael Emerson as the creepy-eyed Other leader, and Henry Ian Cusick as the tormented ex-soldier/monk Desmond -- and there are a LOT of memorable supporting characters.

""Lost"" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television. Creepy, funny, romantic, tragic and sometimes just weird -- and be prepared for the mother of all cliffhangers.",1265673600,,3729,4.944089456869009

Season play does not seem to store it's info on my Samsung blu ray player. Season play remembers where you are in watching the season, and tells you what disk to put in to continue watching and will go back to the exact point you stopped last and you can save this info for more than one person.

3836995,5,B0021L8FR6,"I decided to get this DVD set as a gift for my mother for Christmas, with the intention that we would watch the whole show together and try to catch up in time to watch the new season. Neither one of us had ever seen it before.

As for LOST, I'm sure almost everyone has their opinions about it already. It is a very difficult show to describe to someone who has never watched it, and this is why it took me so long to be convinced. I will say right now that it's the most compelling and exciting show I have ever seen. The only less than stellar thing about this show is occasional problems with pacing. Sometimes it seems that Seasons 4 and 5 could have easily been condensed into one 16 episode season, but at the same time it is also disappointing that Seasons 4, 5, and 6 only have 16 episodes each, instead of 24. The trend seems to be that major events are decided ahead of time as season finales, and then everything up to that is build-up and lead-in. In the case of Season 4, it felt like almost nothing happened until this finale, and the mysterious newcomers to the island were just stalling for time until then. No, I won't tell you why I'm here. Just do what I say before I shoot you with this gun. Sometimes the show resorts too often to taking prisoners and hostages, being prisoners, being led around at gunpoint, and punching people in the face. Hopefully, the 6th and final season will be more than just another wave of strangers with demands, guns, and secrets.

This particular DVD set featured all ""widescreen"" boxes, but I found that on our Sony Bravia, the resolution before stretching or zooming of any kind was fullscreen, and I had trouble making it look right with the DVD player and that television. On the Samsung television with a Blu-Ray player, the picture quality was much better and displayed at a much more believable widescreen resolution.

The DVD extras were not particularly fulfilling. On the back of the boxes, the descriptions of the features promise explanations or new insight about the mysteries presented in each season, but upon watching the features, you find that no questions are answered whatsoever; they are merely asked again. Those hoping to get any additional information about the show will not find it in these features. Instead, what you get is a little bit of behind-the-scenes peeks, some mildly amusing gag reels of actors forgetting their lines and giggling, and a lot of rehashing and fluff. Most discs feature a commentary track for an episode or two, but as we were watching each episode for the first time, we did not want to use them.

However, the presentation of these extras and the menus is very impressive. The menu screen is often a shot of a location of interest from the previous or current disc, and in later seasons features people walking around or milling about doing things. The extras menus are themed to something featured in the season; for example, the Season 2 extras are made to resemble an old 1980's video. It is clear that the DVD production team put their utmost effort into these box sets.

In the end, the only small disappointments about this box set come from the fact that if you become a LOST fan, you always want more.",1265328000,2,3216,4.566724436741768
3836996,1,B0021L8FR6,"I ordered this entire collection in Early Dec 2009 when the offer was on so was very pleased with my 'bargain' and excited to watch all 5 seasons again!

However, 2 months later and I am still waiting for it to arrive in the post, I have contacted Amazon support who after 1 month decided to agree it was missing and sent another set.... This has not turned up yet either and yet again appears to be LOST!!!

I am very dissapointed really as season 6 starts tonight (in the uk anyway) and I was hoping to watch the first 5 seasons before tonight!

3836997,5,B0021L8FR6,"I'll make this brief.  LOST has become my favorite show of all time, bar none.  It combines all the right elements in amazing ways: unique mythology, drama, survival, science fiction, humor, action, larger philosophical questions...it's got a little of everything.  Unfortunately, some people will never be sold on it, but that's life.

I was cautious about buying the show simply because it can already be viewed for free (and in excellent quality!) on ABC's website.  But when I saw that Amazon was having a one-day 70%-off sale on this 5-season set, I couldn't resist!  And let me tell you, these Blu-rays do not disappoint.  This is already a visually stunning show, but in HD, it becomes even more mindblowing.  You really can see every pore, every leaf, every film grain.  Although the features are the same as on the DVDs, these are excellent features nonetheless.  (And you won't see those online!)

Bottom line, if you are a fan of the show, you need to buy these sooner or later.  The show is simply too good to not watch over...and over...and over again, and let's face it - ABC can't show it online forever!",1265328000,,1119,4.740932642487047

What an amazing show. From the mystery of John Locke to the love romance between Kate and Jack, to the comedy of Charlie and Hugo, all the way to the drama of Ben Linus. This show has it all. Action, adventure, beauty, drama, you name it.

I got lucky when this set went on sale for 110 dollars for all five seasons on Blu-ray, which was definitely worth it. The High Definition makes the Hawaii scenery worth watching just for that fact alone, and then the special features go deep as well. I've turned myself into a huge Lost fan, watching season after season over and over again. With commentary, without commentary, you name it. I find myself checking out deleted scenes only to see if any questions can get answered.

There's just one small problem: Season 3 doesn't come with a slip cover! I know it isn't that big of a deal, but I like my sets to be complete. Amazon refunded me 10% of my purchase on an already deeply discounted item, so I can't really complain. Apparently, anywhere you get Season 3, it doesn't include a slip case, so I guess in the end it doesn't really matter that it didn't come with one. I can't really blame Amazon, I guess I'll have to blame ABC or whoever puts out the box sets.

Other than that small setback, the episodes all look beautiful and the sound is also incredible. Pick this up if you're a diehard Lost fan, it seems to always be on sale.",1262736000,,898,4.011173184357542

It was a SUPER purchase!  My son and I have been riveted to the television for episode after episode over the Christmas holiday.  We find ourselves coming home, allowing time to squeeze in an episode or two in the eveing.  It's that good!! If you can get it at a decent price, buy it.

3837082,4,B0021L8FR6,"I jumped all over this deal when i saw it, i almost didn't get on the site that day but checked by just in time to see it in the last 10 minutes. My girlfriend loves lost and i didn't have a clue what to get her for christmas then this was just there. I was a fan but lost interest around the third seeason when i felt they opened more questions than they answered and never did anything proper with the original questions brought up. Only real problem here was when i received my box one end was never taped, just left open, the other end was torn and there was one flat piece of flat packaging smashed into the corner. Also i was a bit dissapointed that there was no collector packaging for the set such as the customer picture that was presented, that would have just made the appearance more impressive. Overall this was a great deal and all minor complaints can be easily pushed aside considering the money i saved and getting pulled out of a nice jam.",1261353600,,957,4.263736263736264
3837083,5,B0021L8FR6,"This show is beautiful.  The oceans, the plants, the island... it's just one of the most striking things to look at on a nice TV.

Usually, upscaled DVD is more than good enough for me, but this is the first time I've been able to say, with no doubt, that blu-ray is much prettier, sharper, clearer.

If you've got a nice setup, and you're inclined to watch this show, this is practically a must-buy.

LOST as a show is engaging, with great actors and production values, and a mysterious plot about an island.  Like Twin Peaks without all the problems and in a much prettier environment.  Is there a supernatural explanation?  Some deep exotic scientific one?  Are they in purgatory?  Time travel implications?  All I can say is that the island challenges the plane crash survivors in many novel ways, and this is pure creativity.  The show actually uses its potential to put the characters into interesting situations much more effectively than other adventure shows.

[Edit to add: I'm one of those who didn't like Season 6.  I found the resolution to many of the mysteries that made the show engaging to be ... uncreative.  I also found the character resolutions to be very poor.  I highly suggest watching the first 5 seasons and leaving the resolution to your own creativity.  It's still beautiful to watch and I wonder what could have been].",1261094400,3,1347,4.716738197424893
3837084,4,B0021L8FR6,"As others have stated, Lost is a very good TV show created/produced by JJ Abrams (of TV and movie fame... see also: Transformers, Alias, The Office, Armageddon, Cloverfield, the new Star Trek Movie, etc.).  The cinematics, audio, and acting are what you would expect from Feature Films, yet it is in an on-going episodic television show.  My reason for giving it 4-stars, and writing this review, is to let people know, that the series will hook you right away in the first three episodes, and keep you glued to your seat for the entire first season... BUT, the script does get a bit convoluted, and somewhat dull halfway through season 2, and on into season 4.  My advice is to stick with it.  By Season 5 they really get back to the matters at hand, and return to an engaging, and enjoyable plot.  You will not be sorry you trudged your way through the less exciting seasons to get back to the good stuff !

Sorry I can't be more specific on this, but even the slightest bit of plot from later seasons will give away a lot from the first seasons... and the mystery really is what drives interest in the story.",1261008000,,1111,4.448275862068965

If you are a fan of any of JJ Abrhams work and haven't watched this series yet, what are you waiting for? HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  I can't wait for an Felicity or Alias on Blu-ray.",1260835200,,278,4.0
3837168,3,B0021L8FR6,"Just wanted to first say that I think that Lost is an incredible show, and that it looks absolutely amazing on these blu-ray discs.  My review focuses more on the misleading picture Amazon has for the bundle.

Amazon's photo for this bundle is not representative of what is shipped.  Season 3 is not in a box that matches the other 4 seasons, unlike what is shown in the bundle product picture.  Season 3 has no cardboard sleeve or box, and looks quite strange when placed in the middle of two sets of seasons with cardboard sleeves.  I ended up pulling the sleeves off the other four to make them match, which is not a good alternative (the cardboard sleeves look much better than the plastic cases), but one that works.  I just wanted to warn any other customers that care about the appearance of their DVD/Blu-ray sets, because I was unhappy when I received this one.

P.S. Two people have posted alternate pictures that show what the bundle ships as.  They were not their when I purchased the product and I'm grateful that someone posted something up.  However, I still think Amazon should take their misleading product picture down.",1260748800,5,1137,4.673366834170854
3837169,5,B0021L8FR6,I bought this when Amazon made this the Deal Of The Day for about $109. I jumped on it. This show is a must own. For all five seasons and for that price I couldn't resist.

3837172,5,B0021L8FR6,"I cant really say much that hasn't already been said.  But if you are the type of person who likes to look for clues and discuss them among fans this is your show.  Its not like the Desperate Housewife's or Grey's Anatomy of today where everything is spoon-fed to the audience, or where the plot keeps repeating (example, someone new comes to town/hospital, main character sleeps with them, they move away, and repeat for next season.)

Back to Lost, its one of my favorite shows of all time.  If you like sci-fi, tropical islands, and smoke monsters this is your show.

Lets just pray the writers use season 6 to tie up everything nicely. :)",1260230400,,642,4.547826086956522

(and I was just starting season 1) So if you wanna get surprised please do not watch that video!

What can i say about the show? well it's so addicting that I watch the entire show in 2 weeks, and now i'm re-watching it again with some friends. Every time you re-watch you find more stuff that you never notice and if you watch it with friends then believe me, you're going to have a great conversation for hours with bunch of theories and before you know it, you are so hooked that you will dream about the Island!
This is a must see show and this is a AWESOME deal you don't wanna miss!
