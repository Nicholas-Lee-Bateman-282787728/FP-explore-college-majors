8392013,5,0977304469,"This is another fabulous & highly educational documentary from film maker Paula Fouce. I highly recommend this movie for anyone wanting to learn more about the history of religion, religious discord, & tolerance.

This intriguing film features the 14th Dalai Lama, Robert Thurman Ph. D. along with many other leaders of different faiths.

Parts of the film are unbelievably beautiful.

A must see!",1336348800,4,397,5.26984126984127
8392014,5,0977304469,"This film is very educational and very interesting, regardless of what religion one follows. I have several friends and teachers who have been to India and who have experienced extreme conflicts and riots first hand being locked into their hotel room for days not knowing whether they will make it out alive. This documentary makes one want to re-think things. Tolerance is something we need more of. People are too judgemental these days, too close minded, and maybe too spoiled. I am so glad I happened to flip thru the channels and see this on PBS. I can only recommend it. Just to hear the different leaders talk...like the Dalai Lama, he is fascinating. I will def buy this DVD. Great info on your website. I really like the Tolerance quotes. Thank you for sharing this with us.",1272412800,6,783,4.681159420289855
