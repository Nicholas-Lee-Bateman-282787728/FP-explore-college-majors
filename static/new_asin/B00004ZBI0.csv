I love everyone of his songs, they are performed with power and passion...yes albeit in the smoldering and brooding mood. I wish there were more videos ( vhs or dvd ) for Enrique's other tours and albums...Eg the VIVIR tour..This item is a must have for die hard fans and collectors !",1497052800,,508,4.655555555555556
7928384,2,B00004ZBI0,"Musically this tape is a wasteland of drippy, boring songs, and one that only his most ardent fans will appreciate.
He seems to sing with sincerity, but there is little that truly marks him as a unique artist in this selection of songs, and it is hard to tell exactly what he is capable of vocally, because of the monotonous, weak material.
The song list is:
1, ""Inalcanzable"" is played over the introduction, which shows Enrique arriving in a helicopter for a performance, signing autographs, etc.
2, ""Experiencia Religiosa""; 3, ""Mueca Cruel"" and 4, ""Por Amarte"", are from the Festival Argentina, and show Enrique in concert, with throngs of screaming girls in the audience.
The rest are videos, are well photographed and produced, and most of them have a ""lost and lonely guy"" theme: 5, ""Si Tu Te Vas""; 6, ""Experiencia Religiosa"" again; 7, ""Trapecista""; 8, ""Solo en Ti""; 9, ""Enamorado por Primera Vez""; and 10, ""Esperanza"".
Enrique is a handsome young man with a winning personality, and one hopes as he matures his voice will continue to develop and that he will select songs that are more interesting, with some melody and distinction. This tape from 1999 is entirely in Spanish, and the total time is 45 minutes.",1064966400,4,1217,4.827751196172249
