7903192,5,B000003TXX,"This story is filled with extremely vivid illustrations that makes the story extremely exotic and beautiful. Geena Davis's narration and the music of Micheal Hedges also gives the story a beautiful touch of the magic of the Indian tribes back then.

The story also has a great moral for eveyone to hear about. When Princess Scargo's village is threatened by the drought and all the fishes had died, Princess Scargo has to make a decision about whether she should keep her birthday present to herself or use her present to save the village she loves. This video discusses about the issue of keeping one's prized to her/himself or use it for a more wiser purpose, such as saving one's life. This film is excellent for the whole family to learn from and the illustrations will get the attention of the younger viewers.",1093651200,2,815,4.73943661971831
