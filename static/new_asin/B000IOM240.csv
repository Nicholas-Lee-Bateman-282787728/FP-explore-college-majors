8146886,4,B000IOM240,"Released before Amores Perros, this movie falls in between the same lines.  It has no real heros or villians, just tragic characters with their selfish desires.  Of course they all desire different things, opposing one another, and that is where the drama begins.
It is a humorous, honest film exposing human frailty in which Mexican storytellers do best.  I recommend the film for its unpredictable story, direction and characters, which at the end of the film will leave you thinking as all great films do.",1084579200,15,508,4.952941176470588
