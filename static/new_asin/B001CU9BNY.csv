8289828,5,B001CU9BNY,"I am a railfan looking for the Santa Fe's ""war bonnet"" design which is very popular in Lionel Trains! This is a very good DVD on early diesel locomotives. When steam was going out very few people captured the early diesel era, they were preoccupied with the end of steam.  You can't go wrong with History DVDs. Great entertainment value. You can see why the Diesel became king over steam! This is 5 stars!",1258934400,,405,4.472972972972973
