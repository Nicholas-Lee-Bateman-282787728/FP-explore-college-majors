8198392,1,B000R211C2,"BEWARE! I bought the Days That Shook The World Series 1 to 3 Box Set from MovieMars, an Amazon US reseller,expecting to receive DVDs that would be region 1 US format (even though it wasn't specified), whereas I knew if I ordered from a UK reseller, it would be region 2 because it was so specified. Unfortunately, the DVDs are region 2 and 4 PAL only and CANNOT BE READ ON US PLAYERS.",1363651200,4,384,4.273972602739726
8198393,5,B000R211C2,This DVD set is amazing.  They reenact all of the stories with great detail and accuracy. My favorite was the story on Hiroshima. It was gripping and made me feel like I was part of the experience that took place.  This set will make a great addition to anyone's collection. Two thumbs up!,1330300800,,289,4.433962264150943
8198394,1,B000R211C2,I have seen the show a few times and decided to check for the dvd. I found the complete series for just $31. I ordered it two months ago and it still hasn't arrived. I never recieved anything from Amazon except an email saying if it doesnt ship by a certain date the order will be cancelled. I didn't understand until I checked on it today. I apparently bought it when the price was misquoted. I bought it for $31 when it was supposed to be $131. I find it funny that Amazon is being so selfish over $100. They really lost alot more as in a customer with many future purchases.,1305158400,3,577,4.160714285714286
