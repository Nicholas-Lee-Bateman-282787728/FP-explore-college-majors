8237129,4,B00105301U,"LOVE OR MONEY is a dramedy that aired on UK television in 2001, and I think the entire sum of its viewership numbered myself and possibly five other random people. Or so it seems. Whenever I mention LOVE OR MONEY, folks assume I'm talking about the Michael J. Fox / Gabrielle Anwar romantic comedy vehicle (which, by the way, I also liked).

The plot takes full advantage of the reality programming craze that's swept the nations. Two competitors, both unlucky in love and strangers to each other, are selected to wed by the voting audience of a dating reality show. Glasgow hair stylist Daniel Conti (Steven Duffy) and Leeds physiotherapist Samantha Clough (Emma Cunniffe) meet face to face for the first time at the altar. They have six months in which to get to know each other and build a real relationship, after which time they'll be invited back to the show to answer a series of intimate and personal questions as chosen by the viewers. Should their respective responses match, they walk away with a cool million pounds.

Except it's not so easy living these falsely perfect lives, not when Daniel and Sam are under the constant scrutiny of the show's cameras and the always lurking paparazzi. Someone in this arranged marriage nurses an agenda, is mercenary more so than starry-eyed. Not to mention, intrusive relatives, significant exes, and clumsy dust-ups in the bedroom tend to sink the romance before it even takes off. It's tough sledding when one's dirty laundry is aired out hot to the presses and to the Nielsen populace. Both Daniel and Sam make their share of foul-ups that end up in headlines. In all this artifice, can true love blossom?

If you're looking for some sort of damning expos on the evils of reality television and the media passing itself off as Big Brother, there's a tiny bit of that here but, mostly, this teleplay is played for laughs. This isn't at all as incisive as, say, NETWORK, although there is some mean snark targeted predominantly at the reality show hosts. Me, I enjoyed LOVE OR MONEY for what it is: an amiable, slow burn romantic comedy that occasionally dips into dramatic territory. It features fine performances by its two leads. Emma Cunniffe and Steven Duffy share an easy rapport. I like that it takes time for these two damaged people to trust and finally fall for each other. I even like the pretty ridiculous moment in which Samantha, six months later, once and for all decides what's more important to her: love or money. Give this movie a try. There's enough of an uncertainty with regards to Sam's once neglectful, long-distance lorry driver of an ex-husband - who now wants to give the marriage another go - that you are sort of left twisting in the wind.

You should also avoid the despicable Bollywood remake.",1338249600,,2776,4.753112033195021
