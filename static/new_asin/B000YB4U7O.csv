8231681,4,B000YB4U7O,"Let's be honest here, some of the best sci-fi films originate from other countries--this is a fact; most definitely from anime. While Japan remains the dominant force in driving philosophical themed, ""cyberpunk"" anime, South Korea makes an effort to match their Japanese counterparts with their own Korean anime--a gorgeous little film called ""WONDERFUL DAYS"" (2003,better known as ""Sky Blue"" in Western countries). The film may not be as deep or intelligent as Mamuru Oshii's masterpieces with philosophical content, but the film can stand on its own. Directed and written by Moon-Saeng Kim, the film rivals the animation in ""Final Fantasy Spirits Within"" with a very effective story. Not bad for South Korea's first big-budget anime effort.

2140 A.D. in a dystrophic future. Earth has been decimated by war, exploitation of its natural resources, and over pollution. Dark Clouds have enveloped the sky blocking the sunlight, it rains a lot, and the human race in on the brink of extinction. In this chaos, a group of elites have created a safe haven powered by pollution itself, a huge city called ""Ecoban"". Thousands of refugees flock to the Marr in the hopes of gaining entry to the technologically advanced city. However, this is a place for the elite few and they are denied entry. The refugees now called ""Marrians"" have become slave laborers to create the pollution Ecoban requires.
Now, it seems like the earth is starting to recover, and pollution is running low. The Elites of Ecoban will do anything to maintain their level of power. Now, a former Ecoban resident named Shua aided by a rogue scientist named Dr. Noah, must penetrate the city's power source called the Delos system--but his childhood friend, a beautiful woman named Jay may stand in his way. Can they settle their differences in time to save the world?

The film's premise may not be wholly original, and borrows from the black and white sci-fi film ""Metropolis"". ""Wonderful Days"" is all about modern issues such as ecological disaster, pollution, environmental abuses, and social struggles. It is quite simple and there is nothing very subtle with its commentaries about those issues. The film is also about the denial of authority figures of the truth, that people who have power may indeed abuse their power; they would abandon morality and embrace injustice to maintain such power. The elite may have at one point saved some lives in their creation of the city, but all those efforts were motivated by their own selfish goals rather than the fact that it needed to be done to preserve the lives of others. It was all because of the opportunity to seize power.

Outside Ecoban, the world remains a wasteland, and the human populace is slowly declining. The film also displays bits of protests in the form of riots--the Marrians are superior in number, but they hardly have any resources, therefore, the elites with all their technology is in control. The Marrians have no resources because Ecoban needs them to work and maintain their way of life; the unfortunate must remain in poverty and sacrificed. A strong commentary about authority figures is expressed; that some political figures cannot be trusted. (No surprise to this viewpoint, since the Korean people fought hard for their democracy)

Jay is a woman very much loyal to the laws of Ecoban, but there are times that she doubts their methods. The reappearance of childhood friend, Shua proves to be the catalyst for her reawakening. The two have very strong links years ago which was severed when Shua disappeared and thought dead. Now, Shua's goals is to show his little brother the blue sky, a simple goal but motivated by a noble cause. Cade is the one man who threatens their friendship and budding romance, there is a love triangle around the screenplay but it doesn't really take center stage. The film keeps its focus on the manipulations of the elite and the struggles of the Marrians. Korean performers Joon-ho Chung, Hye-jin Yu and Ji-Tae Yu did an exceptional job in bringing life to their animated counterparts. (I prefer to watch my movies in their original language, I did not watch it with the English dubbed track)

The clever blend of 2D/3D animation is just impressive. The backgrounds are rendered and motion control is used to give it the look of CGI which maintains a dark and brooding atmosphere, the city looks very advanced while the Marr, well, it looked like our usual ghettos which is the melting pot of chaos. The sound is also quite phenomenal and mimics 3-Dimensional sound. On a technical standpoint, the film doesn't pull any stops; it just looks gorgeous throughout. Director Moon Saeng-Kim utilizes superb real-life mapping and film effects  to emulate realism. He uses everything in the book of animation trickery--from focused backgrounds, shifting central points, shaky camera tricks and a use of wide perspective shots. The only thing that made it a tad inferior to other CGI animated pieces (such as Final Fantasy) is that the characters remained within the confines of 2D rendering. But then again, it was intentionally done this way; and the visuals are equal to ""Vexille"" and ""Appleseed"". Oh, the characters doesn't have over-expressive eyes and perfect complexion, they looked simple but anime-inspired. The action is quite good and maintains within the realms of gunplay, martial arts sequences, and chases--with touches of blood and some gore (the Korean release is 3 minutes longer). The technologically advanced bikes were just very impressive and the air ships by the Ecoban cops were also reminiscent of ""Appleseed""--it was hard to believe that they were rendered. The film just looked very cool and fresh.

""WONDERFUL DAYS"" is a visual marvel. It is a pure cyberpunk feature and has an effective depiction of social hardships, a sordid dissident, an over-indulging elite and flawed heroes--and it just has loads of style to spare. Fans of sci-fi anime will not be disappointed, and while the film doesn't come close to the brilliance of the original ""Ghost in the Shell"", it is worth a look or two. The story does move along quite well and the action is definitely entertaining enough. Again, the story isn't intricately groundbreaking or complex; it is quite good if you're a fan of ""cyberpunk"" movies. The quality of the animation alone is worth the price of the Dvd, and it does deserve a place among the sci-fi anime films worth watching.

Highly Recommended! [4 Stars]",1235347200,6,6465,4.996285979572888
