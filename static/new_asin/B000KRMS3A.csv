8158795,3,B000KRMS3A,"Let me say the production of this video is top notch. The moves are easily and clearly seen. HOWEVER, this is tournament-style jiu jitsu. 90% of the moves require you to 'pull guard'. This would just be asking for you to get your head kicked in real Vale Tudo/Pride fighting. The title is very misleading. NO STRIKING, minimal takedown training. Like I said, this video show some good tournament style jiu jitsu moves that require 'pulling guard'. I wouldn't recommend 90% of the moves be used in a vale tudo match.",1173052800,,515,4.670329670329671
