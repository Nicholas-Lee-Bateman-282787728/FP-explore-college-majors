5000428,5,B006K1ALI4,"This is about as painless as it gets. Doug Boduch does a great job breaking down these songs and performing them as well. In fact, he probably plays them better than the man himself does in concert (as far as the way the were originally recorded). Another valuable thing this DVD does is give a player a workable ONE guitar/standard tuning arrangement of the songs. I wish they had these types of ""tools"" when I was just starting out. It's almost like cheating. But it is fun.",1342828800,8,476,4.482758620689655

8499971,3,B006K1ALI4,"Cons
  Many songs are not their full length so you don't get to learn the complete recorded song.  Sharp Dressed Man is missing 45 seconds.  Legs is missing a whole minute at the end when Billy plays the outro solo.
  Play Along and Demo Track for Sharp Dressed Man has an annoying orchestral cymbal crescendo every bar that is wrong.
  Song selection - If you have Waiting For The Bus on here, then it should be followed by Jesus Just Left Chicago.  Every Top fan knows that.
  Like all Play Along series you are not going to get all the backing parts tabbed and shown.  So if there is a cool rhythm change behind a solo, that is not going to be covered.  So if you really want to know all the parts you have to buy a songbook, research the web or figure it out yourself.  That's why I tend to buy the Play It Along DVD's that focus on one guitar bands with minimal overdubbing to avoid that pitfall.
  Pros
 Billy Gibbons style sounds like he is moving all over the place on the neck but in reality many of the things he does are very subtle.  Economy of motion, muting, pinch harmonics, hybrid picking are more fully realized in a video format with multiple angles.
 Other than the Sharp Dressed Man cymbal snafu all the audio tracks are clear and well recorded.

  Summary
 This DVD was average.  There is simply no excuse for two songs missing extensive sections that have prominent guitar solos.  I will probably buy the Lick Library Learn To Play ZZ Top volume 2 by Danny Gill when it becomes available.  I have found that series superior to the Hal Leonard Play Along series.  Gill covers songs extensively (every note, technique, tone) and is a top notch musician and teacher.",1385510400,,1685,4.421568627450981
8499972,5,B006K1ALI4,"So far I've learned just ""Sharp Dressed Man"" from the DVD.

The Guitar Solos are included in Tab and also Doug Boduch plays them in real time.  He doesn't do a step by step of the solos, but I'm fine with the tab and watching him play it. (One reviewer had said there were no solos on the DVD, but there is).

So you can watch the instructor, follow the tab, and learn the solos yourself.  One thing I liked is that he does the solo in standard tuning (rather than open G tuning with a slide) because when you are doing both rhythm and lead guitar, it is impossible to change tunings mid-song :)

The DVD has multiple views.  Wide view with tab is what I use.  The ""Player's view"" only confuses me because my brain is used to processing as though I were facing another guitarist.  But it is nice that they include these different views anyway.

I would like if the tabs could be printed out, or if there were a screen view of the tabs in larger pieces than 2 measures at a time.

I like the instructor, he's pleasant and knowledgeable.",1380844800,5,1035,4.23469387755102
8499973,3,B006K1ALI4,"If you are a good player who just needs to see these songs played to pick them up this DVD is good.
Unfortunately the lessons are not very in depth and they don't really go over the solos, pretty much just shows you the song and tells you what the key changes are.  No playing tips no solos.  The other reason for a low rating, you cannot play the backing tracks separately.  Unable to use the Hal Leonard amazing slow downer and use the backing tracks separate from the DVD was very disappointing.
I had to buy the Play Along #99 as a companion making this a little pricey.",1366156800,5,574,4.247706422018348
