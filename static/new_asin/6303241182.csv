616913,4,6303241182,"KINO markets ""Sidewalks of London"" under its alternate name, ST. MARTIN'S LANE. Their SP speed, full screen VHS dub is from a well-preserved source film. Audio is Hi-Fi.

The movie's title is the address of Charles Staggers (Laughton), who is one of a dying breed-- a busker. These street performers were a common sight in London in the early 20th Century. For coppers and shillings, they'd ""work"" a crowd waiting in line outside a legitimate theater. Dancers, musicians, comedians, tumblers, singers and orators all plied their wares then passed the hat around.

Liberty (Leigh) picks pockets when she's not dancing for coin. After he sees her dance, Charles asks Libby to be his busking partner. They later form a quartet with two musicians. Songwriter Prentiss gives the talented Libby a foot up onto the legitimate stage; she eventually becomes a star. (Also outstanding here is virtuoso harmonicanist Larry Adler, who plays both on-screen and off.)

616914,4,6303241182,"This is a review of ST. MARTIN'S LANE (1939) directed by Tim Whelan. ST. MARTIN'S LANE is about street performers in the London theater district in the time just before WWII. They were called by the name, ""Buskers."" Anecdotes about their ups and downs and how one of them , Liberty, played by Vivian Leigh, actually makes a smash hit on the legitimate stage mostly because of her native wit, talent and beauty and the fact that a theatrical producer played by Rex Harrison is bonkers for her.

Pretty unusual for a theatrical film but definitely worth seeing for if nothing else, bang up performances by Charles Laughton, Rex Harrison, Larry Adler, et al.  I just realized that the London theater district milieu puts me to mind of Chaplain's LIMELIGHT. While ST.MARTIN'S LANE is no LIMELIGHT it is a snapshot of a way of life that probably no lomger exists.

616915,3,6303241182,"I bought this as a gift, and was disapointed to find out that the second title (Wings of the Morning) would not play. I tried it on several players with the same result. Did a return and got a replacement, with excellent, speedy service, but the second disk has the same problem. I found however that we could play the movie by sneaking up on it with chapter search, and then it worked well.

This was the first Technicolor film shot in England, and colors can be a bit odd, and the sound is weak, but all in all a worthwhile film. Too bad the menu system is goofy.",1256083200,5,565,4.18348623853211
616916,1,6303241182,I was very disappointed in the DVD of these classic films.  The color television in Wings of the Morning was not as in the original film and I found St. Martin's Lane very loud and boring.  I didn't like having to bother with it to get to Wings of the Morning.  I returned it to seller for credit as not with color TV  as described on the cover.,1241222400,,345,4.029411764705882

SYNOPSES--

WINGS OF THE MORNING
An Irish Lord (Banks) marries a gypsy (Annabella). When he later dies in an equestrian accident, his family runs the hated woman off. She goes to Spain. To avoid the Spanish Revolution a half-century later, the now elderly gypsy returns to Ireland with granddaughter Maria (Annabella again) in tow. Maria meets and falls in love with a Canadian horse trainer (Fonda). Film includes stunning views of the Irish countryside. (Watch for great Irish tenor John McCormack, as himself.)

616919,5,6303241182,"A heart-wrenching, crushingly tender tragicomedy, showing an intimate portrait of the lives of England's professional buskers, or street performers, who were on the run in the face of the modern entertainment industry.  Vivian Leigh, Rex Harrison and Charles Laughton star in this powerful film, which demolishes the pollyanna-ish conventions of the American-style, Busby Berkeley-Harry Warren musicals.  Laughton steals the show as Charlie, the leader of a struggling busking troupe, in a heartbreaking performance that paves the way for his famous turn as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  Beautifully shot, but also with a dynamic and well-written script, this film doesn't have a weak moment in it.  I'd never heard of it before; now it's one of my favorite films.",1029283200,23,764,5.394957983193278

7842637,5,6303241182,"In 1956 I was in London as a young tourist and witnessed the possible last of the Buskers who performed in the theater district. The acts were so much fun, from a juggler to a guy playing the accordian to a couple of tap dancers and they made the rather long wait to get into the theater delightful.

""St. Martin's Lane"" is Charles Laughton's film. His performance as a Busker reciting poems like ""If"" by Rudyard Kipling and his portrayal of Charlie, the fat and very plain Charlie, will bring tears to your eyes. Charlie takes in a lively. indigent young woman played perfectly by Vivien Leigh, and makes her part of his Busker troupe, but she is spotted by a theater producer, Rex Harrison, and soon eclipses Charlie in the  legitimate theater and is mobbed outside the theater by autograph seekers. Laughton's feelings, the feelings of a man who appears to wear his heart on his sleeve but whose real heart is broken will almost break your heart, too. A lesson in humanity, the struggles of a few men and women who search sometimes blindly to find themselves and a purpose in life echo the struggles of people  everywhere but ""St. Martin's Lane"" is unusually poignant and you will come away feeling better about the human race. Handsome, suave Rex Harrison, by the way, is in this movie like icing on the cake but Charles Laughton is the cake.",1412726400,3,1346,4.6

7842639,5,6303241182,He was without question one of the best actors on film despite his lack of conventional good looks. This rating is a little misleading. I give 5 stars for his musical moments. The story itself is nothing much and Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison don't really help it along. And yet I can watch it over and over to listen to Charles performing his numbers.,1394064000,3,352,4.430769230769231

7842641,4,6303241182,"This classic starring Charles Laughton, Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison will make you laugh and cry. These are the best British actors of their time and the on-screen chemistry never stops for the entire 90 minutes. Laughton and Leigh will brings tears to your eyes with just their facial expressions. Vivien Leigh will thrill classic fashion enthusiasts with the rare case of a 1938 actress dancing in sleek slacks instead of a skirt. Laughton will break your heart right along with that of his character by wearing his heart on his sleeve and openly professing his love for a girl half his age.

Also known as ""The Streets of London,"" this movie is a bit of a sleeper for classics enthusiasts, but once you find it, you'll want to add it to your collection. Get it while it is available.",1373673600,,787,4.621428571428571
