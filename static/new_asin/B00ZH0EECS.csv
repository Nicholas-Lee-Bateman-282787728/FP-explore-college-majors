7283007,1,B00ZH0EECS,I had to shut this off after only 4 minutes. The opening scrawl and screechy music were just too annoying. And why did the voice-over person sound so angry?,1480982400,,156,4.413793103448276
7283008,1,B00ZH0EECS,"It's a fake documentary, and not really my style of humor, especially not 90 minutes of it.  I made it through about a third of it.",1475366400,,131,4.038461538461538
7283009,1,B00ZH0EECS,WTH. Dumbest movie ever. I am guessing the other reviewers had a hand in making this snooze fest.,1474070400,,97,4.444444444444445

7283012,5,B00ZH0EECS,Truly the best movie ever made.  It says so right on the box.  It's a little slow and a little weird but I have not laughed so hard at a movie in a loooooooong time.  Enjoy:),1472601600,3,174,3.7777777777777777
7283013,5,B00ZH0EECS,Documentary meets comedy!  The humor in this film kept us watching even as the credits rolled.,1439942400,,94,4.875
7283014,5,B00ZH0EECS,"This is the kind of independent film making everyone can love.  I really enjoyed its mockumentary style.  It is a clever conceit.  The protagonist never breaks character, keeping the running joke of the often seen ""athlete overcomes"" plot going to absurd, yet believable, levels.  I saw this with my family during its run in theaters, and bought the DVD as soon as it came out.  Bought a couple of copies for gifts as well.  It's too bad Hollywood doesn't have more originality like this.  I am always hesitant to see a relatively low budget, independent film.  You never know what you are going to get.  This one definitely pays off.  I laughed from the beginning to the end.  I even laughed after the end; the credits are also funny.",1437868800,,735,4.62015503875969

8720317,5,B00ZH0EECS,A very original documentary (mockumentary) about a real tournament in New Jersey. And a real competitor. It is a clever and original look at a real skee ball tournament at an arcade on the Jersey shore. Funny and well done.,1531353600,,223,4.6
8720318,5,B00ZH0EECS,30 percent documentary....70 percent mockumentary....100 percent entertaining.  Hit em with the Heinnnnnnnn!,1531180800,,108,8.0
8720319,2,B00ZH0EECS,"I appreciate the effort, however it was boring.",1530662400,,47,5.0
8720320,1,B00ZH0EECS,"I watched this on my Amazon Prime so I'm glad that I didn't throw any money away on this movie. It's a sophmoric and moronic satirical mockumentary that looses your attention within the first ten minutes possibly sooner. I skipped through it to see if something would grab my attention further in the movie, but it was just as boring and idiotic at any point that I stopped and tried to watch again. The funny thing is that the producers in keeping with concept of this movie were probably also wanting one-star poor reviews. If so, they got it!",1503532800,,545,4.515151515151516
8720321,1,B00ZH0EECS,Wish I went to the reviews first.  You can jump to 61 minutes in to watch what you thought this movie would be about and stop watching 5 minutes later.,1500768000,,151,4.033333333333333
8720322,5,B00ZH0EECS,You'll like this one.,1486598400,,21,4.5

8720324,1,B00ZH0EECS,I don't want to give it any stars. What the hell was that?,1484697600,,58,3.5384615384615383
8720325,1,B00ZH0EECS,"Terrible fake documentary. There are those that do mockumentaries really well, and then there is this pile of trash.",1482710400,,116,5.157894736842105
