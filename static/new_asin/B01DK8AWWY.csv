8756147,5,B01DK8AWWY,"Mystery, murder, humor, and Japanese folklore all wrapped up in a beautifully packaged Hungarian movie. Pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be so good (in my opinion).",1532131200,,174,5.25
8756148,5,B01DK8AWWY,"I saw this a couple years ago at the Seattle International Film Festival and loved it -- so glad to be able to have other friends see this now via Prime.  This is a very dark Hungarian fantasy, sort of ""Ameilie"" meets ""Eating Raoul.""  The story is told with a lot of imaginative visuals and revolves around Liza's attempt to meet her life's love on her birthday.  The story is set in 1970's Hungary and Liza is a live-in nurse to the widow of the Japanese ambassador.  The other resident of the apartment is the eternally-young ghost of a Japanese pop singer.  So, yeah, your usual blockbuster premise...",1531180800,,604,4.555555555555555

8756151,5,B01DK8AWWY,"I saw this movie on viooz.ac in the original Hungarian language without subtitles.  This movie is a scream!!!  I love it.  I wish it was in the original language (Hungarian) with English subtitles. It reads like a surrealistic folk tale from Japan plastered onto a 1960's communist Hungary!  The heroine is in her late 20s looking for love, i.e. marriage.  All her suitors meet with varying degrees of misfortune and even death due to a ""curse"" inflicted on the heroine by a dead 1960s Japanese pop idol, hence the ""fox fairy"" handle. Totally wild innovation.  The photography and clothing has that Tim Burton feel akin to his ""Edward Scissorhands"" film. No, that's all I'm saying about this very creative and funny movie plot. To play this movie from Amazon you will need to own an ""all region"" dvd player (  I own a pioneer all region player and adapter -through Amazon)  I intend to get my hands on this film next month through Amazon.  This is a fabulous movie.",1469145600,5,965,4.662721893491124
