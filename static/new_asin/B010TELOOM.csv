8723152,5,B010TELOOM,"This was a very good mini series. I saw it on some cable channel one October because of the Halloween season. It was about a year or so before The Conjuring 2 was released. This mini series made the concept for Conjuring 2 even more appealing. You might even like this series better.

I usually don't write reviews too often, but I am disappointed at the people writing bad reviews about this series because they neglected to notice that it was a Region 2 DVD. It was noted in the product details, and the UK ratings on the cover are also a dead giveaway. If you can't return the DVD, spend a little extra and buy a multi-region DVD or Blu Ray player. Then you can purchase other region DVDs without the disappointment.",1495756800,4,719,4.406015037593985

8723154,1,B010TELOOM,"I wasn't told that there was a region code in order to play this movie. I was so disappointed because I was really excited about it. I just wish that there had been a disclaimer or something saying you couldn't watch it in the US, otherwise I wouldn't have waisted my money. But i figured that I can at least warn others. IF YOU LIVE INE THE US DON'T BUY THIS, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO WATCH IT.",1475452800,5,391,4.0256410256410255

This is a TV mini-series consisting of three 45 minute episodes. In August 1977, the Hodgson family has been bothered by a rash of poltergeist. It seems to center around Janet (Eleanor Worthington-Cox) an 11 year old girl who likes to play pranks and tell scary stories. They call in Maurice Grosse (Timothy Spall) who coincidentally had a daughter Janet who died one year ago on a motorcycle accident. It seems Janet is being bothered by a poltergeist named Joe with a dirty mouth. They make a pretty big deal over it so they can run a mini-series.

I like the film, although this haunting wasn't too horrific...that ""based on a true story"" thing tends to water things down a bit as reality is dry. Interesting to watch, just wished it went somewhere.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1448841600,4,827,4.612244897959184
