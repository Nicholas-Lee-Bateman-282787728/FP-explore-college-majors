7909540,4,B00000I4OM,"When I jumbled through the VHS $1 rack at this video store, I saw two men in seperate beds on the this video cover. I'm gay, and I thought this was a SUBtextual gay movie. I wuz wrong!! This was a very sensitive, intellectually stimulating film!! It wuz billed as an Odd Couple for College. I HATED the Odd Couple!! But, this movie was very very well written and acting was excellent. The gay character in FAME (the movie) was in this with Lance (""The Last Starfighter"" a favourite SF sleeper of mine) Guest.
  Guest played the hung up, tightly wound scholar heading for medical school. The FAME guy was a kooky eastern philosophy loving slacker in 1959 Northwestern University. Both were highly intellectual and there were hints that FAME guy was gay (the actor from also X-Files was gay). They both learn about life's journey from each other.
  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! ARC <heykidscomics242> (on buyer's marketplace).",1214784000,,916,4.852564102564102
7909541,5,B00000I4OM,"Set in 1952, this tells of two young men who are polar opposites being assigned to the same dorm room at Northwestern University. Cool movie if you are from Chicago or attended Northwestern University. Plus it has John Cameron Mitchell of Hedwig and the Angry Inch fame and Shortbus! Who knew back then! The question is whatever happened to Lance Guest or Barry Miller. Definately worth the price since its not on dvd and won't be anytime soon. You can buy it for $14.54 if you need to see the cover art also on Amazon. Good Movie for the Price!",1210377600,,545,4.46
