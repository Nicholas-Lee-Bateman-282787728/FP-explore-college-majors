8490961,5,B0061T5R3O,"Was looking for an older edition for my mother since the newer Paris By Night are not any good. The new versions try to rap, dress inappropriate, and try to emulate American singers, etc. This version was perfect and she enjoyed it, this is just singing and remembering the country of Vietnam including the war, and some of the talented singers that made this show great in the first place. I couldn't find this anywhere else, so I'm glad to find it here on Amazon. Wonderful quality DVD with great sound, menu, and outstanding video. I did buy this new so I cannot vouch for any other types of video.",1420156800,,601,4.472727272727273
