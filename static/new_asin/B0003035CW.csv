2154577,3,B0003035CW,"I think someone like Yaya Decosta would have played the black girlfriend so much better. Zoe Zaldana as usal was too harsh/plastic to convince me she was deeply in love and into the relationship. Plus did anyone take time to notice the huge difference in facial/racial asthetics between her, Bernie Mac, the mother and her sister? These are some of the things that made it a bit unbelieveable. But it had it's funny moments. Ashton Kutcher was good playing the bumbling affectionate boyfriend and Bernie Mac the comedic over-possessive father... though not particuarily believable as Zoe Zaldana's father or a member of a conservative black family. Think it could have gone deeper too into the love story too about why and how they connected. They played it safe. My Boss's Daughter as a comedy was much funnier....",1515628800,,815,4.956204379562044

2154608,5,B0003035CW,"Part of what made this a great movie is that the writers did not avoid all of the hard issues.  I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan in general, but in this he did a good job.  Zoe Saldana and Bernie Mac gave their usual wonderful performance.  Not going to give spoilers, but their are parts of this that are hard to watch if you are at all mixed.  Still a love story (or two), a comedy, and lesson.",1507852800,,394,3.949367088607595

I would've given it another star, but nothing made sense after the part where the women left. Seemed like the ending was just thrown together because they didn't know how to bring it all back together right, and improvised in slap-dash kind of way.",1497139200,,420,4.467532467532467

2154678,1,B0003035CW,"I did not like this movie, it was very distasteful, disrespectful, and just plain vulger. Its promoting racemixing which the Bible clearly forbids, in several verses. The UN section 2 International law forbids racemixing known as racial genocide, which this movie also promotes and its perverted and should be banned from being sold to anyone. Its like promoting a modern day Sodum and Gammora. This is not racist or offensive only stating the facts.",1490486400,,450,5.094594594594595
2154679,5,B0003035CW,"There is something about Canada I love and not the least of that is the utterly fantastic The Guess Who.  When I was a kid and AM radio was king, Im taliking abut the late 60s/early 70s, there was this band that cut through with something more substantial than, say, Tommy Roe.  It was The Guess Who.  In short order there was some meatier pop which included Creedence Clearwater and even Three Dog Night to a certain extent.  You could tell this was superior songwriting with some strong instrumental accompaniment.  Like CCR The Guess Who was a real band with songwriters in the band who could deliver the goods.  I was hooked and I wasn't even a teenager yet.

FWWThis concert so many years later captures what I was already cued into as a ten year old.  Burton Cummings is a superior vocalist if not the consummate frontman (hell do however based on talent).  Randy BachmanWell, hes not that far removed from the Canadian Paul McCartney.  Yeah, hes really a treasure.  Canada in many ways is like The Crowns US sibling.  They have had to so often stand in the shadow.  Well, on this nigh they didnt.  Even the extremely crappy weather couldn't stop this train.  I say that with the respect that the elements, the weather, is definitely more powerful than man.  That said, this crowd wouldnt part.  With lightning and wild wind driven rain The Guess Who and their Canadian fans delivered an exceptional night.  We can all be glad it was captured on film to which this DVD is proof.  I could go on and on.  Its nigh perfect in a myriad of ways.  It encompasses not just The Guess Whos perfect pop, but the garage rock of BTO songs by Randy as well as a couple of Cummings solo endeavors.  This concert has gravitas and soul.  It has its heart in a place that surely connects with the loving audience.  You know what?  Im with them!  Ive been to Canada once in my life and stayed with a Canadian family for a couple of days and I love Canada.  Its a great country and The Guess Who is my favorite Canadian music export ever to which thei fantastic concert underscores.

This is a concert for the ages.  I know it will be forgotten by the masses, but for the faithful it should be raised up high.  It is that great.  I am proud to have purchased this one and I utterly prod you to please buy it.  Keep this flame alive.  Maybe the greatest Canadian band of all timeat least the equal of Rush who now get their just deserved place in the rock world.  Hurry up and click on buy before it disappears!!!",1489795200,,2499,4.384279475982533

The storm going on in the background adds a unique sense of drama, and the comments from the band between songs are interesting and entertaining. Aside from the AWESOME performances of the band, we were struck by how resilient, well mannered, and patriotic the fans in Winnipeg were. They were not thwarted by a fierce downpour of rain, and did not leave when the band needed to exit the stage for nearly an hour because of the bad weather. Risky? Perhaps. But it goes to show that Canadians are a very hardy bunch, that's for sure!

Every member is on top of their game.  For me, ""Glamour Boy "" is one standout.  Randy puts in a lead that the song didn't even have before.  They headlined in LR in ""74"" with Blue Oyster Cult opening, odd pairing but fun. They played for over two hours...not a clunker in the set...then played another 30 min. for about 500 that wouldn't leave Barton...met Burton in LR years later on the Ringo All Starr Tour...very nice guy...a pro...anyway, buy this...it is great.",1431475200,4,701,4.395348837209302

2155047,5,B0003035CW,"This is, quite simply, an extraordinary rock n' roll document. I own a boxload of these, and this is by far the best.

What may be the most amazing thing of all is that this concert, in Winnipeg's Goldeyes Stadium, captures the hometown reunion of a bunch of guys who by all rights ought to be playing the oldies circuit at county fairgrounds. There are three of the original RCA-label members (Randy Bachman, Burton Cummings, and drummer Garry Peterson--how long has it been since these fellas recorded ""These Eyes"" and ""Laughing""?) Added to the mix are virtuoso guitarist Donnie McDougall and bassist Bill Wallace, who came along quite a bit later in the Guess Who's history, long after Bachman had left and founded Brave Belt--which soon morphed into Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Yeah, the guys have all put on a few years (and a few pounds). But like all serious musicians, over the years they have just gotten better.

With due respect to the late Kurt Winter, Jim Kale, and others who played an important part in the Guess Who's long history, this just may be the band's best-ever incarnation. I have no idea how the ""original three"" hooked up with the other two, but the combination is genius. Even though Randy Bachman doesn't need guitar support from anyone (a very old joke has it that Bachman was so good that he had to be replaced by TWO guitarists), Don McDougall's strong vocals are a welcome addition to the band's structured harmonies and the fact that Bachman allows him his share of the guitar solos doesn't hurt either. Some of us may forget that McDougall bore a lot of the Guess Who's guitar burden in their later years.

There is an awful lot of atmosphere that contributes to the overall vibe of this concert, some of it relating to the weather and some to the excellent cinematography. The opening shots feature Bachman and Cummings mounting the stage with an ominous prairie thunderstorm towering in the distance (Cummings mouths the word ""whew!"") while the opening bars of ""Runnin' Back to Saskatoon"" reverberate in the background.  ""Runnin'"" here has considerably more edge than any version of the song you've heard before, and right away you can tell that this is a band reborn, here to take no prisoners. There are plenty of shots of Randy Bachman's incendiary guitar soloing during this opener, and even though ""Runnin'"" dates from the Kurt Winter era, you can tell from Randy's ""air vocals"" how much he loves the song. It gives a new meaning to the word ""reunion.""

I guess that comparisons with 1972's ""Live at the Paramount"" (the first album, I believe, to feature McDougall--who turned in a great solo vocal on ""Glace Bay Blues"") are inevitable. Let's just say that the highlights of ""Paramount""--""Pain Train,"" ""Truckin' Off Across the Sky"" and the aforementioned ""Glace Bay""--are easily matched here by ""Runnin' Back to Saskatoon"" (the Paramount version pales in comparison), ""Takin' Care of Business,"" and the old acoustic gem ""Talisman."" I am fully aware that many Guess Who fans believe that the Paramount version of ""American Woman"" could never be matched, but the version rendered here fixes what were to me a few problems at the Paramount: Excessive length, a rather overly-stoned guitar excursion by Winter that goes nowhere, and, yes, the lack of Randy Bachman, who co-authored the song and gave it its unique guitar snarl.

Let's keep in mind, too, that ""Paramount"" was recorded 28 years before ""Running Back Thru Canada."" That's a mighty long time, and some reviewers have taken from that not much more than that Burton Cummings' voice isn't quite what it was in, well, 1972. That may be true, but he does a fine job regardless (he may not go for ALL the old high notes, but he doesn't hit clinkers either) and as some others have noted, his piano and harmonica skills have increased exponentially since the ""good old days."" No one drags this show down, and that goes for Burton as well. He has a hard job, singing all these difficult songs one after another, and you can tell how grateful he is when he takes a long swig of water and turns the lead vocals over to Randy for a song or two (the audience seems to love the one-two punch of Guess Who classics followed by BTO standards--just look at all those Canadian flags waving).

Another strength of this collection is the set list. In addition to all of the Guess Who warhorses you might expect, there is some unexpected back catalogue (""Guns, Guns, Guns"", ""Heartbroken Bopper"", and the aforementioned ""Talisman""); Cummings gets to stretch out his old lounge-lizard persona on chestnuts like ""Glamour Boy"" and ""Sour Suite"" (""the song with the zip code!"" Cummings exults). Best of all, Bachman shows off his incredible jazz guitar chops on the Guess Who's ""Undun"" and BTO's ""Looking Out for Number One."" And I would be remiss if I did not mention a very interesting ""coffee-house"" version of ""Let It Ride,"" which features a fine acoustic solo by McDougall.

I think you can see that this is a can't-miss concert event for any fan of the Guess Who (or, for that matter, Bachman-Turner Overdrive). The dramatic weather, the enthusiastic hometown crowd that endures an hour-long downpour without budging an inch, and the eclectic set list all add up to an unforgettable viewing experience. Some reviewers have noted the cumbersome feature of the six ""bonus tracks"" being cut off from the rest of the show, but that's really not such a great drawback. I've owned the abridged audio CD of this concert for years, and I'd  much rather have to ""click and choose"" to hear the bonus tracks (with video, of course) than to miss out on some very significant inclusions to what was one of rock's  greatest reunion shows.

By the way, the ""rehearsal hall"" bonus clip shows why the truly great rock n' roll bands sound better than all the other rock n' roll bands out there. Pay attention, young musicians!",1378771200,7,5886,4.8063241106719365

I have several concerts on DVD, some make me want to keep watching them over and over, I wouldn't say this one had that effect.",1365465600,,339,3.9558823529411766
2155077,4,B0003035CW,"Running Back Through Canada features a live performance of a reformed version of the Guess Who, recorded in 2000, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the hometown of members Burton Cummings, Randy Bachman, Bill Wallace, Garry Peterson, and Donnie McDougall.

This performance is particularly notable, because the band had to stop playing and leave the stage, due to rain and a lightning storm.  Fortunately, they were able to return and continue the performance, before a loyal and appreciative audience, who waited through the rain.  The main feature is a 15 song 90 minute performance.  Among the bonus features are six additional songs, an interview with the members of the band, and extensive rehearsal footage.  All in all, this a really nice release for fans of these veteran rockers.

Although challenged by the weather conditions, and the pressure of playing before a hometown audience, everyone on stage seems very relaxed and in good spirits.  Dressed in an Elvis shirt, Burton Cummings is centerstage behind his keyboard stand.  His voice sounds more mature, but still has power, and displays the same unique singing style, that first made the band a major success in the late 60's.

Randy Bachman is showing his age a bit, but is clearly having a wonderful time.  Even with the massive career he went on to have with Bachman Turner Overdrive, Randy has always been underrated as a guitarist and songwriter.  It's very cool that the Guess Who included three BTO songs in their set, ""Looking Out For #1"" and ""Let It Ride"", both performed with acoustic guitars, and the rocker ""Takin' Care Of Business"".

Most of the band's better known songs are included in either the main performance or the bonus tracks.  High points include ""No Time"", ""Undun"", ""These Eyes"", ""American Woman"", ""Laughing"", ""Hand Me Down World"", ""Share The Land, and ""No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature"".  The lesser known ""Tailsman"", is also a special treat.

The video presentation is very relaxed and easy going, without the constant cuts prevalent today.  Coverage of the band is good, and the editing is sensible.  When a solo is being played, that's what the cameras are usually focused on.  Image quality however, isn't always the greatest, as there are some instances of softness and pixelization.  Perhaps the weather was a factor, but it's not really that big of a distraction.  Sound options are Dolby 2.0 stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.

Bachman, Cummings, and Peterson, formed the nucleus of the group, during their breakout period in the late 60's.  McDougall and Wallace joined the band post-Bachman,  during the 70's.  Although this particular lineup never played together as the Guess Who during the band's glory days, they still have good chemistry together, and are obviously intimately familiar with the material.  If you are a Guess Who fan, you will certainly appreciate this DVD, and the warm memories it may generate.",1364515200,2,2921,5.086134453781512

The individual gave the actors their props--especially the chemistry between Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac--but felt that the film itself fell short of his expectations.  I disagree because he was comparing this movie with the original GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER? with Sidney Poitier.  I felt it was an unfair comparison because thematically they shared the same premise but Kutcher, to his credit, did not have the poise nor the presence of Mr Poitier which enhanced his supposed ineligibility to qualify as a future son in law.  All Kutcher brought to the table was his love, dedication and spunk and he was going to make every effort to prove himself worthy to his boss, to Bernie Mac and most of all, to Zoe Saldaa who had her moment of questioning the viability of their relationship.",1362441600,,849,4.794520547945205

Every last song was familar to me & I could have sang along to every one(except no one,including myself,wants to hear me sing).They were, and still are, a great band. I saw them live once but by then Domenic Troiano had replaced Bachman.(I can't blame Bachman for leaving- he sold 30 million albums with Bachman Turner Overdrive). There are 4 BTO songs performed here as well as the Guess Who hits(no complaint). Burton still has a great voice & Bachman has left a big mark in r&r history.
Unfortunately the video quality is not very good considering this concert is from 2000. The close-ups are fine but it seems the further the shot the worse the video quality. This was quite noticable on my 55"" tv. It's also 4:3 aspect ratio. This concert with a 16:9 ratio & blu-ray quality would have got 10 stars from me(yes, out of 5)

Obviously Bernie Mac was funny it, but Ashton Kutcher had some really funny scenes as well, and as usual, is great looking (yes I am biased and would probably like any movie Ashton was in). It is also nice that it isn't a typical boring cliche romantic comedy, it actually has a social issue behind it. A few things that annoyed me about the movie though were the scene at dinner where they are egging him on to say racist jokes... This is an example of an obvious double standard, and it's pretty obvious throughout the scene that it wasn't going to end well, but they continued to encourage him. The whole scene was not one of my favorites. I also didn't particularly like the part where the women leave and then the men have to come and apologize and the women are always right, etc... (brings up a lot about the relationships between men and women, and no, the man is not always wrong). In short though, this is a movie I would recommend.",1311379200,,992,4.426229508196721

2155106,4,B0003035CW,"AS far as the company who sent the DVD - fast delivery and it arrived in great  condition.

Now for the movie.  I would give it a B-/C+.  It was entertaining and funny, at times, but the plot lingered on for the last 30-45 minutes and I started getting bored with the same conversational themes.  The plot was the typical relationship comedy - not bad as far as that goes. This movie is quite different from the the orginal  movie with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, but it needed to be somewhat different in terms of blending in with the current social climate.  The serious social conflicts encountered in non-traditional relationships was emphacized and a recurring theme presented with a comical twist.  Most of the movie focused on the interaction between the bride's parents and the groom, but the movie did not include the groom's parents or their interactions with the brides parents, which was a pivotal element in the original movie.

If you are looking for a drama paralleling the original ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" then you might be dissappointed, especially if you're a serious movie buff.  However, If you just want a sweet, somwhat comical dysfunctional family and love story, then this movie is worth the money. It's not 1 of those movies that I will watch repeatedly, like I did with the orginal movie classic (which by the way was before my time).  Maybe I'll bring it out again on a  rainy day.",1305504000,,1425,4.724696356275303
2155107,5,B0003035CW,"""Guess Who"" is an excellent and funny comedy about an African/American man who discovers that his beloved daughter is much in love with a white boy. Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher, who play the father and the girl's love interest, have wonderful chemistry as each try to prove to the other they are looking out for the girl's best interest.

 This is really one of my favorite Ashton films as the script is beautifully directed and the leads give standout performances.

 Like many Ashton Kutcher romantic comedies ""Guess Who"" (loosley based on the 1967 film ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"") was an enormous success garnering over $100,000,000 at the box office.

 The DVD includes deleted scenes, gag reel, commentary by the film's director, and the featurette ""Love is the Melody: The Making of Guess Who"".",1295395200,,807,4.940740740740741
2155108,5,B0003035CW,"Living in Canada and being of a certain age, you tend to forget how many songs The Guess Who created that became part of the soundtrack of when you were growing up. This concert DVD pulls together most of those songs in what is a tremendous performance. Burton Cummings might not be the easiest guy to work with, but his talent is unquestionable and he gives a good effort here, even though his voice isn't quite what it was in his prime. Randy Bachman these days may be better known as a radio show host on CBC, but the man was and is an incredible guitarist and songwriter. Some of his guitar work on this DVD is fantastic, to the point where he blows up one guitar in the middle of American Woman and the guitar tech has to provide a replacement. Donnie MacDougall is hugely underrated, as he is a talented vocalist and fine guitar player. Garry Petersen and Bill Wallace keep the beat as a solid rhythm section and add good backing vocals. One of the things you forget about The Guess Who is the quality of their vocal arrangements, and this lineup does a good job of recreating those.

A comment on American Woman -- the version here is the same as that on ""Live at the Paramount"", with the extended bluesy opening... ""whatcha gonna do when the roast beef's gone?""... just fabulous, I had a smile on my face a foot wide.

There are two downsides to this set. The concert was shot on video in 2000 in standard-def and so video quality is not of the same standard as later DVD sets. There is also an annoying sound issue with the concert on some tracks, where volume seems to be capped or filtered for some reason, and the level seems to vary. I didn't notice it on every track, but it's definitely there on a few.

For me, these are minor issues for such a superb performance by such a great band. Buy this. You won't regret it.",1288915200,4,1832,4.335276967930029

2155114,5,B0003035CW,"Percy Jones takes great pride in the knowledge that he is always right, especially when it comes to the welfare of his family. When his daughter Theresa brings her new boyfriend, Simon Green, home to meet Percy and his wife Marilyn, he is unaware that Simon has already proposed to Theresa and plans to announce the engagement at Percy and Marilyn's 25th anniversary party. As far as Percy's concerned, no man will ever be good enough for his baby girl and the long line of struggling-artist types Theresa has dated so far has only served to bolster his conviction. So that there are no unpleasant surprises this time around, Percy, a bank loan officer, runs a credit check on Simon. The young man, a successful stockbroker, certainly looks good on paper, and for the first time, Percy is actually looking forward to meeting one of his daughter's boyfriends. However, the young man he has envisioned--a dazzling combination of Denzel Washington, Colin Powell and Tiger Woods--is not who arrives at his doorstep. Percy is aghast and more than a little indignant when his daughter presents her decidedly Caucasian boyfriend. Once he is over his initial shock, Percy begins interrogating Simon about his family history, education, career, and favorite sports. Feeling pressured to impress his prospective father-in-law, Simon boasts of his (nonexistent) past as a NASCAR driver, which only serves to arouse Percy's suspicions. Regardless, Simon's repeated attempts to make a good impression are futile. Percy rebuffs him at every turn and makes it his mission to expose Simon as a fraud and undermine his daughter's new relationship. This movie goes down very smoothly.

2155117,4,B0003035CW,"No band - American, Canadian or Zimbabwean - laid down the clever, melodic, insightful and fun tracks in the 70's record after record with the constant personnel changes and upheaval the GW had to deal with. In the marketplace, they held their own but could and should have been a commercial behemoth. Maybe we diehards are lucky they weren't; we may not have ""Live At The Paramount"" in it's expanded version to feed us smart, cynical, edgy pop/rock all these decades hence.

The DVD has it's problems, for sure, but I don't think they add up to all that much. I like what I hear a whole lot and like what see a little less. But the best bands of the '70's tended to be uninterested in image and instead concerned themselves with superior songwriting and kick [...] live performances. This sort of work and marketing ethic is foreign to most modern bands and their fans, but it sure made for some awesomely great records. That it fails to deliver us sexy video in 2009, well, you'll excuse me for excusing them.

I have admired Burton Cummings' feisty attitude, craftsman's work ethic and consistent fearlessness in the studio and onstage for 40 years. Bachman is a superb musician, whose jazz chops delight me every time. But Cummings threw some risky long balls without him on ""Share The Land"", while Bachman was handing off to less talented journeymen with BTO.

I know I have failed miserably to actually review this DVD. Can't help it. I love this band, admire everything about them, and while I note the technical problems with the DVD, they do not stop me from enjoying the proceedings thoroughly. Get the CD if the visuals don't work for you. If the sound is a bummer for you, pull out the old CD's and relish how great they were. Personally, I want it all. This band was just too friggin' good.

BTW...avoid the current ""GW"" like the plague. It's original rhythm section Peterson & Kale with 3 or 4 ringers. Kale was booted from the band in 1973 for being a selfish drunk. Now, he thinks he's getting revenge. Don't give this goon the satisfaction. JUST SAY 'NO' to ""Kale's Klones"" masquerading as The GW ! Imagine Pink Floyd without Gilmour OR Waters...the Stones without Mick OR Keith...The Who without Townshend OR Daltrey. That is what you are in for with this fraud GW. Remember folks, Bachman/Cummings are the real deal and they write, play and perform like it. Kale brings a ""C"" game band to parking lot barbeques and off brand state fairs everywhere.",1252800000,4,2467,4.651376146788991

I really loved the whole thing. What a juiced up version of TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS. Great keyboards from Burton, Bachman sounded great for a dinosaur, too.

You could tell the band wanted to be there-and the people loved them. I am glad that no one got barbecued by water, electricity and lightning.

  I'd recommend this video to anyone but caution them that the vocals are not what you remembered The Guess Who to be.",1231632000,4,642,4.587719298245614

2155127,4,B0003035CW,"For me, as a long-time fan, this DVD is a treasure that I have sought for
years.  For casual fans, the flaws might reduce this to 3 stars.

Let's start with the weaknesses.

Weaknesses:

At his peak, Burton Cummings had a great voice.  Over the years, however, he has lost much of his voice.  When he can't hit the high notes, he constricts his throat instead, and the effect is irritating.  By the time this DVD was made in the year 2000, the combination of age and possibly illness left his voice quite strained, and the problem is particularly noticeable on ""Laughing"" and ""Undun"".

The concert is interspersed with interview clips, which are interesting the first time that you see them, but you probably don't want to see them every time you to play the concert.  There ought to be a way to play the concert without the interview interrupting.

Although it's not surprising that the camera focuses primarily on Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman, it would have been nice to see more of the rest of the band, especially bass player Bill Wallace, who is rarely on camera.

One of the other reviewers said that the video quality was terrible on his HDTV.  I usually play this on a 27"" non-HD TV and it looks reasonably good.  However, I played part of it briefly on a very good HDTV, and indeed it looked bad on HDTV.

Strengths:

The band included different people at different times, and these 5 people (Burton Cummings, Randy Bachman, Gary Peterson, Don McDougal, and Bill Wallace) were never all in the band at the same time during the band's peak creative and commercial years (late 1960's and early 1970's).  It's therefore a pleasant surprise that this may be the band's strongest lineup.

The backup vocals by Peterson, McDougal, and Wallace are generally good, and on ""No Time"" they are almost perfect.  The vocal arrangements are more complex than you might realize; in some songs, such as ""Raindance"" and ""No Time"", the backup vocalists are singing at least two or three different lines of music (in addition to Burton's lead).  The bonus material showing the band rehearsing in a concert hall reinforces my admiration for their under-appreciated backup vocal work.

Although Bachman is the big name lead guitarist, second guitarist McDougal has some solos, including one in ""Guns, Guns, Guns"" and even the Bachman-Turner Overdrive song ""Let It Ride"".  He does a fine job on each, and it's a pleasure to see Bachman share the spotlight with the lesser-known but talented McDougal.

Although Cummings has lost a lot of his voice, he hasn't lost his ability to ""tickle the ivories"".  Until you see him showing off at a few points in this concert, you might not realize how fluid a keyboard player he can be.

This concert takes place outdoors during a thunderstorm, and at one point lightning forces the band members to leave the stage for their own safety -- a lightning storm is not the best time be standing on a metal platform holding wet electrified instruments.  In a subsequent interview, Cummings says that he was worried that the concert would turn into the ""disaster of the summer"".  But the fans stay through the rain and lightning, and the band returns.  The footage during this period might seem extraneous to people looking for a pure concert, but I (and obviously the band), felt that this adds to the drama of the concert, and that the audience deserved recognition for their patience and dedication.

I have been a big fan of the Guess Who for more than 30 years.  I was too young to see the original lineup play live.  I saw this lineup play in the U.S. around the year 2001/2002, and they did a good job.

For a fan like me, this DVD is a treasure, and would have earned 5 stars if Burton's voice were better.  For those who are not already hard-core fans, this is certainly a good video, but not a ""must-have"".  I give it a solid 4 stars for hard-core fans and 3+ stars for others.",1224547200,8,3911,4.646288209606987

It was at night and those feelings are amplified at nighttime. A friend had sent me ""Guess Who"" and due to the negative reviews it received, I had  thought I would not like it, so I had postponed watching it.  I put it in the dvd player earlier that day and as I stood in the house trying to decided what to do - whether to go to a motel to spend the night or not - I remembered that I had put ""Guess Who"" in the dvd player earilier that day and had liked the voices of the lead characters for the few minutes it played in the background.

Bernie Mac is hilarious as a father who does not take kindly to Ashton Kutcher's bumbly potential son-in-law, and hilarious sparks are ignited all over the place.

I believe this movie is highly, HIGHLY original although I will admit it does borrow a little bit from the movie Meet The Parents.  But otherwise it's extremely unique and a comedy classic which is better than old-time movies that had people like Cary Grant and Charlie Chaplin or whatever.  I think Bernie Mac is ridiculously funny, and all you have to do is watch his crazy faces that he makes and you will lose it, I promise you.  If they ever do decide to remake this movie they should think about Sinbad and Sean William Scott, because they're terrific too.

I love this movie because it's exactly like real life, and it holds a mirror up to society and shows us that we're all funny like Bernie Mac deep down inside whether we're black, white, red, yellow, or polka-dotted.  Go see this movie immediately and the only thing that will be Punk'd is your heart for this gentle, bold, provocative drama-comedy that is fun like a train ride!",1211155200,2,1306,4.485232067510548

Otherwise, one of the greatest band out of Canada and a pure pleasure to see all the originals doing many of their songs strongly even after all these years....

2155137,3,B0003035CW,"Whimsically, I borrowed a copy of ""Guess Who"" from the Public Library. OK, I confess - I chose it chiefly because I enjoy looking at Ashton Kutcher's face; a guilty pleasure. (Who says a man can't coast through his career on looks alone?) As for the movie itself, I didn't expect much and guess what? - I didn't get it, either. It's just your average generically bland, dopey movie. And though ""Guess Who"" is supposed to be something of an update of the 40 year old ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", I noticed more gender stereotypes than racial ones; i.e. the frivolous female fluff muffins 'bonding' over strawberry daiquiris. I imagined the (male) creators of this film expecting women to find these scenes 'empowering'; gag me with a spoon.

But ""Guess Who"" is probably no worse than dozens of movies that are released every month; it's just that discriminating viewers will try to bypass them. If you have an IQ in the three digits, you might want to set your sights on something higher, unless you too are slumming by succumbing to eye candy.",1197676800,,1046,4.684782608695652

Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings doing every Guess Who hit I can remember, and some that I didn't.  I had a vague memory of Rain Dance and Albert Flasher but I hadn't heard them in years and didn't even know that they were Guess Who songs.

The thunder storm!

Some interviews spliced in during the concert, but not too much.  I thought they made the concert more interesting.

A separate interview bonus feature.

A great additional set of bonus songs (but why not just leave them as part of the concert.  I don't get it, but they're great).

About 20 minutes of rehersal footage which actually has several interesting renditions of their songs.  It's well worth watching.

2155144,3,B0003035CW,"There's really nothing new within `Guess Who' but that doesn't make it worth the sit down.  It's pretty much `Meet the Parents' redux without the brilliance that was Robert DeNiro, but it's funny in it's own right and offers enough humor to satisfy the average moviegoer.  It's a comedic remake of the classic film `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', a film that at the time was pushing boundaries and asking important questions.  Now the issue of race is more a forced discussion topic as apposed to a real problem.  Racism, while it does still exist, is mostly embellished and scrutinized in an unreasonable way and thus becomes more of an annoyance than a real problem.  The point being that there is no real morale center to `Guess Who' despite the point that Bernie Mac's character may be a tad bit racist in his viewpoints.  `Guess Who' is mainly just good ol' fun.

When Percy and Marilyn decide to renew their wedding vows after 25 years of marriage they are pleased to find out they are to meet their daughter's boyfriend, but when he turns out to be white Percy is not pleased and becomes determined to find something, anything wrong with Simon in order to ruin his chances with his daughter.  Simon is just trying to make a good impression but nothing he does will ever be good enough.  In the end of course there is some reckoning on the parts of both Percy and Simon and they all become one big happy family, but getting there, while familiar, is still fun.

Ashton Kutcher does a fine job of filling in Ben Stiller's shoes.  Notice I will continue to liken `Guess Who' to `Meet the Parents' mainly because they come across in sections to be the same film.  Ashton is funny when he needs to be, convincing, and precisely on point when it comes to Simon.  He may not be the most talented bird in the coop, but he does do this brand of comedy well.  Bernie Mac is also funny, but he can't live up to the award worthy brilliance that was Robert DeNiro.  DeNiro delivered each line so convincingly, so effortlessly hilariously dead-pan while Bernie Mac seems to be overwhelmed at times as if he knows he can't truly stack up.  The rest of the characters are mainly background noise.  Zoe Saldana doesn't have to do anything but be gorgeous, and that she is, and Judith Scott, well she's no Blythe Danner that's for sure.

In the end `Guess Who' is worth the watch through.  It's nothing spectacular and definitely nothing fresh and new but it's funny and that's all that really matters.",1188259200,,2491,4.557303370786517

2155148,5,B0003035CW,"Some reviewers have said that interracial romance has come a long way since the original film GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER? played in theaters four decades ago. For instance,on the CBS sitcom THE JEFFERSONS,Tom Willis,a caucasian and his negro wife Helen Douglas Willis. Bernie Mac is Percy Jones,the role portrayed by Sidney Poitier in the original film. At first Percy is initially shocked but welcomes Simon Green(Ashton Kutcher),a caucasian,to the family with open arms. Simon is engaged to Percy's daughter Teresa(Zoe Saldana). Also Percy and his wife Marilyn are renewing their wedding vows on their 25th anniversary. At a family gathering,Simon is telling skin color jokes and everybody laughs until he tells the final,offensive one. Percy and Simon sleep in the same bed for a few nights. Of course,Percy and Marilyn have a big fight just before the big vow renewal,as do Simon and Teresa. Percy and Simon are Wall Street stocktraders,and Simon ends up quitting. But Percy tells that Simon was terminated(""He's broke,unemployed and loves my daughter.""). In the final scene,we see DVD menus of the videotaped vow renewal. I thought this film suddenly broke and I had to navigate with my own player! I also thought if this film was anything like the Jeffersons,I'd enjoy it. And it was somewhat,with a once-mention of ""honky"" by Percy's father. Also,pre-JEFFERSONS,the late Isabel Sanford appeared in the original film. Also get a load of Percy and Simon racing cars. One of Teresa's sisters is named Keshia,probably inspired by the Cosby Show actress Keshia Knight Pulliam. Mac and Kutcher are FOX sitcom veterans,Mac is the star of The Bernie Mac Show and Kutcher, aka Mr. Demi Moore,gained notoriety on The 70's Show.

Let me also say that this is a fine concert -- the band is really on, playing before friends and family during a violent thunderstorm in Winnipeg.  The performance is great, and the production (meaning sound quality, in the sense of balance and clarity) is great, too.

So why only 2 stars?  Because the volume of the DVD is variable, not constant, as if there were some sort of limiter in the processing.

Some great DVD concerts that excel in both audio and video quality are Santana's ""Supernatural"" and Peter Frampton's ""Live In Detroit"".  Those are both excellent concerts.

Burt Cummings voice has changed or his style has changed since most of his original early recordings.  He doesn't have the deep powerful voice we are familiar with on the early recordings and he now puts a Axl Rose from Gun-n-Roses twang on the end of a lot of his words.

The problems (and there are problems) with this movie have been touched on somewhat by the other reviewers, but I shall try to lay them to rest here once and for all by nailing them on the head.

First, the film takes the wrong approach to the race issue by modeling ""MEET THE PARENTS"" rather than ""GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER.""  This film should have been less misleadingly named ""MEET THE BLACK PARENTS.""  The chosen approach, as it is, makes parental approval of ""the boy"" the focus of the film, rather than the larger issue of societal approval of ""the interracial union.""  There is a big difference between our cheering for Bernie to accept this sweet, noble kid (and how could he not?) and our applauding of societal change.

Second, the film is blatantly dishonest in a manner typical of sitcoms.  As we all know, in order to garner laughs week after week, the sitcom offers a watered-down, ""safe"", toothless reflection of contemporary truth.  Everybody seems to get along.  The problems are always superficial and the main characters can always point to someone off-set as ""the cause of the world's ills.""  There are too few exceptions to this rule--""All in the Family,"" ""The Jeffersons,"" ""Good Times""--and even they become watered down after the first few seasons and start feeling ""safe.""

And there is the key to this movie's dishonesty.  We feel safe watching it.  Why is that?  Why do we Americans (with our history) feel safe watching a movie about race?  We do NOT feel safe watching the original ""GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER,"" not at all, despite the genuine humor in it.  We feel safe with this one because we know right up front that the premise is not . . . honest.  It's funny, true, silly as heck, true, but not honest: a successful black man is upset because his daughter has brought home a fiance who is handsome, well-mannered, successful and white.  I'm sorry.  I must have missed something here.  Where is the big problem with THAT?

See, for white people this is an issue, but for blacks it is a mere shrug and then dismissal.  The boy is white.  So what.  Most of us have some white in us from way back, if you know what I mean.  Look at how fair skinned some of us are. Look at how fair skinned MOST of us are compared to our brethren straight from Africa.  Oh, every now and then there'll be a snide remark about the boy.  Some jealousy.  Maybe even something a bit stronger.  But for the most part, THAT relationship, as far as African American kin are concerned, will go unnoticed in the course of things.

This is not to say that African Americans are not racist.  In many ways African Americans are just as racist as white Americans.  But it is only in the world of TV and movies do black people show THIS PARTICULAR kind of racist sentiment to such a degree that it is worth writing a screenplay about.  Our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks who could afford to from living in neighborhoods with whites of similar earning power.  Our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks from working at jobs they were qualified to do simply because they were not white.  Our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks from attending colleges that they had been accepted into simply because they were not white.  Finally, our history tells us that American racism prevented blacks from marrying people that they were in love with if those people had white skin.  See where I'm going with this?

The point is that African Americans, believe it or not, have been fighting since 1865 and then 1968 to live where they could afford to live, to work at jobs they were qualified to hold, to attend colleges that they had been accepted into, and to wed, white or black, those that they had fallen in love with.

Do you see the dishonesty now?  Making a movie about a successful black man who does not want his daughter to marry the good, clean, honest man she loves, black or white, is sort of like making a movie about a well educated black man who does not want his bright, gifted child to attend Harvard or Yale or any other top school the child has been accepted into.  ""What?  How dare you turn down your Spellman scholarship for Harvard!  I am so upset with you!""  Well, I'm sure it does happen from time to time, but not often enough to make a fuss (or a big budget movie) about.",1167868800,3,4594,4.557457212713937

It includes so many hits by what is arguably the greatest band ever to come out of the Great White North (some would say anywhere) and for those that are wondering, no it doesn't restrict itself to just tracks by TGW alone.  When they performed Takin' Care of Business from the BTO days, even the dog stopped what he was doing to watch...  The originals like American Woman, These Eyes, etc., are pure gems.  The concert includes some of their lesser known tracks as well, which is nice because it takes you on a trip down memory lane that you usually don't get without pulling out the vinyl, since they almost never show up on the oldies stations.

""Guess Who"" is a funny film about a black girl bringing home her white boyfriend to see her parents who, especially the dad, is shocked to discover that their daughter's boyfriend is white. It is a good setup for some hilarious moments, which it does have some, but only for a one time viewing. I have never seen the original film that this movie is based on, so I can't compare this to the original ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" Yeah, this movie has some really funny parts but I tried to watch it again and it wasn't as good the second time around.

2155167,2,B0003035CW,"**1/2

When it was released in 1967, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" was acclaimed as a ""breakthrough"" film for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial romance.  In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so-called ""mixed marriages"" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic.  And that is exactly the case with ""Guess Who,"" a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original.

The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around.  Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier) home to meet the family.  On the distaff side, we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter.

Since interracial marriage is no longer the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama.  Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target of a securities-and-exchange commission probe.  Indeed, with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father-in-law, ""Guess Who"" feels more like a remake of ""Meet the Parents"" than of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.""

The real problem with ""Guess Who"" is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions.  Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate sitcom.  For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo, etc.).

All of the performers are fine, especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles.  However, they just haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here.  ""Guess Who"" might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.

Still, it's been 38 years since ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" first shocked the nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition.  Which is why, in the year 2005, ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a breakthrough film and ""Guess Who"" was not.",1151280000,,3097,4.959381044487428
2155168,3,B0003035CW,"I went to see this movie with my boyfriend on a Friday night, and it was good. I though it was a good date movie. It's funny, not long, but it's definitely predictable. Though there might have been some racist jokes or comments, it was pretty funny. It seemed like it could happen in a real life, and I think many face that problem. It's good to address those kind of problems in funny movies.",1149206400,9,393,4.253333333333333
2155169,4,B0003035CW,"I did NOT have high hopes for this, when it was marketed as an Ashton Kutcher comedy based on a switcheroo on the ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" premise.  Girlfriend Theresa and Simon (Kutcher's part) return to her home for her parents' 25th wedding anniversary, but she has neglected to tell her parents he is white.  It just wasn't clear to me that when an upscale black girl brings home a goofy white guy hilarity would automatically ensue.

The fellow who lifts this above its premise is Bernie Mac, playing Percy Jones, the father of girlfriend Theresa.  The part is a parody of a parody - Dad makes Ashton sleep on the sofabed to keep him out of Daughter's bed, Dad gets into slapstick competition with Ashton because he doesn't think the dude is good enough for his daughter, etc.  But Mac is not only a gifted verbal comic, he is a world-class physical comedian.  At the same time he endows this silly part with a real dignity - you can really believe this is a guy who holds his family together, who loves his wife as much as he did 25 years ago.

I don't need to see another parody of a Spencer Tracy movie (I can't imagine anyone who would actually), but I'd love to see more of Bernie Mac.",1147996800,14,1201,4.382882882882883
2155170,4,B0003035CW,"I thought that the movie was pretty funny, but there were so many places during the movie where I cringed with embarassment for Ashton's character.  He had to jump through some major hoops and not a soul on her side of the family was truly helping.  Being in an interracial marriage myself, I understood some of the uncomfortable scenes.  There was quite a bit of stereotypical mumbo jumbo that seems to always be put in movies on this topic, but all in all a pretty good little comedy.  As a side note, I thought they made such a cute couple.  Thumbs up in my opinion.",1147737600,,569,4.380952380952381
2155171,3,B0003035CW,"""Guess Who"" is a two-headed beast.  It's a decent buddy comedy featuring an over-protective father and his goofy, soon-to-be son-in-law.  It's also a mild and somewhat boring romantic comedy.  When the primary characters, Percy Jones(Bernie Mac) and Simon Green(Ashton Kutcher), interact with each other, the film manages to conjure some solid laughs from the viewer.  But when Kutcher and Mac attempt to be romantic with their respective female leads, this flick falls apart.

Taking it's main plotline from ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner,"" this film manages to give the viewer a role-reversal in race relations.  I have to admit that it was nice to see the white guy on the receiving end of prejudice in a film.  Remember folks, racists aren't always white.  Mac's character pushes this particular matter to a head at the dinner table, where he makes Kutcher tell some black jokes.  At first, the jokes are relatively tame, cute even, but one joke in particular nudges Mac over the edge, and I personally believe that his reaction was uncalled for in the situation.  To be honest, I've heard plenty of other black jokes that could send anybody, no matter what their color, reeling with anger or embarassment, depending on which end of the spectrum you are on.  The particular joke that Kutcher tells is offensive, but it is no more offensive than any of the previous jokes that he tells.  He is made out to be the bad man, even though he was simply giving Mac what he wanted.

As stated before, the film falls flat when romance is thrown into the equation.  Had this film stuck with the buddy comedy routine, it probably would have been much better.  Bernie Mac is much funnier than Percy Jones allows him to be, and Kutcher is just too much of a dolt to be a believable successful and sweet guy.

Mildly recommended, though there are much better comedies out there right now.",1146700800,,1877,4.764705882352941
2155172,5,B0003035CW,"I rate this Guess Who concert above and beyond the standard 5 stars. It's fabulous. There are about 22 songs including their bonus songs. Burton Cummings has not lost anything over the years. Not even his boyish and crazy charm with adorable,sexy expressions. He looks great and is as gorgeous as ever. If possible, Burtons voice is better than it ever was. They do all their hits almost exactly in the original format with alot of extra added to them. I loved them back in the 60's and 70's and do still now. Randys incredible on the guitar too with mega closeups of his hands playing. Infact, ever solitary one of them are incredible musicians. Better than I remember. American woman was done in such an incredible way but one song that sticks out as well is Talisman. They have never performed it in concert other than in their Finland concert tour. It seems to me that all the groups that were popular when I was young(Not that I'm that old. I am 48 to be exact) are coming back or or are still going strong. It goes to show exactly where all the musical talents lie and there is no doubt in my mind that The Guess Who is back and will be for a very long time. The songs performed are:Albert Flasher, No Time, These Eyes,Glamour Boy,Rain Dance,American Woman,Talisman,No Sugar Tonight,Lookin' Out for #1,Share the Land,New Mother Nature,Runnin' Back to Saskatoon,Takin' Care of Business,Laughing,Bus Rider & Undun. Plus you get 6 bonus songs and a 20 minute interview and rehersal hall segment. The Guess Who plays for their home town crowd in Winnipeg and the crowd adores them and it is very obvious. Infact, the group performed in a very bad thunder and lightening storm that included severe down pours but never the less with the bad storm and all the entire crowd didn't budge. They stayed for the entire concert rain and all. It was so dangerous that the group had to leave the stage for about an hour and when they returned everyone was still there. Absolutely one incredible and very exciting concert from one of the best musical talents in the world. I recommend this to everyone. It is well worth the price. I have many concerts plus I am a musician and this has got to be now my favorite. I don't know what else to say other than if you are a Guess Who fan then you will most assuredly love this dvd. I recommend buying it before you can't anymore. The entire concert is over 2 hours. Also....the camera man did one heck of a job filming this with many closeups of all their faces and their hands playing. The band features Burton Cummings,Randy Bachman,Garry Peterson,Donnie Mc Dougall and Bill Wallace. Simply awesome!!!!What a performance they give!!!!!",1143676800,59,2671,4.625263157894737

I can't believe in this day and age they can make a movie about black people not accepting white people and vice versa. and not only that going on and on and on about it too. Apart from that I felt this movie was just a rip off of ""Meet The Parents"" the only twist being the racial subject. I must admit I've never been a Bernie Mac fan and after seeing this movie I know for sure I am not a fan. There are some really bad and stupid moments in this film too like the first night Bernie meets Ashton he witnesses some hanky panky between Ashton and his daughter so he wants him out of the house and drives him to a motel, and the scene where they go go cart driving, I mean it was all just too far fetched. The only part of this 50 minute movie I thought had some nice moments was when Ashton was telling black jokes at the dinner table, but the negative of that scene is is that they make out that it's wrong to tell black jokes but it's quite alright for Bernie and his family to make a huge deal about Ashton because he's white. In closing this movie has too much loose ends and is still living in the dark ages, and the casting, writing, directing, acting and story are just all wrong.",1142640000,3,1329,4.095785440613027
2155175,3,B0003035CW,"`Guess Who' is not going to make a bold statement about racial consciousness. It is not a Spike Lee film; it is a comedy starring Ashton Kutcher, and that tells you a thing or two about the nature of `Guess Who' a remake of the 1967 Stanley Kramer film. Though it is not very ambitious and original, `Guess Who' is still an amiable and pretty funny comedy with Kutcher, Zoe Saldana, and Bernie Mac. And you know, it is hard not to make a funny comedy with Bernie Mac in it.

A nice and charming Afro-American girl Theresa brings her nice boyfriend Simon home to introduce him to her father Percy. Ashton Kutcher is the nice guy, and Zoe Saldana is the nice and charming girl. The film's story starts when always reliable Bernie Mac as Theresa's daddy comes to know that his daughter's boyfriend is a white. And Simon has to confess that he has recently quit (or lost, depending on your perspective) his job.

Predictable? Yes, it is. Well, the filmmakers do know that, and they also know that interracial marriage alone is not enough to make a feature film these days. So they added several set-pieces that could be found in `Meet the Parents.' Those episodes are not especially original - like wild go-cart chase scenes between Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher revealing their rivalry - but they are well-acted and certainly funny. Kutcher is always good when doing goofy scenes, and Bernie Mac can be always hilarious without exaggerating his acting.

At certain level, the film poses some questions as to the racial barriers between whites and blacks at the black family's dinner scene, in which Kutcher's white character tells racial jokes. The idea is interesting, but the film refuses to push the issue further, and its momentarily serious tone is soon dispersed by the following romantic/comedic mood. Some would find the film's attitudes weak and timid; others find it acceptable, thinking it just a comedy.

Though it is not exactly the best comedy in 2005, `Guess Who' is still pleasing and likable comedy thanks to the capable cast. And any film with Bernie Mac is worth our time and money.",1142035200,,2098,4.739726027397261

This was billed as a comedy and I did not find anything even remotely funny in it.  Bernie Mac tries to be tough (a la Robert DiNero in Meet the Parents) but fails miserably to be convincing.

The only bright spot in the movie is the actress who plays Bernic Mac's wife who gets mad at Mac for not taking seriously their planned remarriage and goes to bond with her sister and girlfriends.  The rest of this putrid attempt at comedy really leaves a bad taste in your mouth and makes you wish you had gotten Sidney Potier's movie instead.",1140393600,,695,4.156716417910448

The story is about a black girl (Zoe Saldana) who is in love with a white boy (Ashton Kutcher) and wants to announce their engagement on her parent's 25th marriage anniversary. Her dad (Bernie Mac) won't approve the white guy, not because he is a racist, but also uncomfortable about his daughter's relation with him. The movie is all fun, can be watched with family and as said before will keep everyone laughing.

Bernie Mac's character as Percy Jones is awesome, and he the one character you will keep watching the movie for. Ashton Kutcher, is all right and improvement in his acting is evident.

2155184,4,B0003035CW,"Guess Who is a Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher comedy that bears no resemblance to the 1967 Guess Whose Coming to Dinner starring Sydney Poitier.  I haven't seen the original but understand it was more of a drama and socially revelant.  The 2005 version shares the plot of a white guy with a black girlfriend coming home to meet the girl's family.  This movie however, is straight comedy, played for laughs.  There could have been some uncomfortable racial situations, but there weren't.

I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Kutcher plays Simon, who is dating Theresa and she is black.  She takes him home meet her family without telling her family Simon is white.  Bernie Mac, playing the over protective father Percy, can't believe his daughter is dating a white boy and sets out to make Simon's stay at the house as uncomfortable as possible.  The scenes between Simon and Percy are the best.  Theresa's character takes a back seat in this movie.  She exists because she has too.

This is a fun movie that is straight comedy.  There are few moments that try to comment on the problems of interracial relationships, but the movie quickly moves on to another scene of Kutcher or Mac hamming it up from the camera.  Don't hold it against this movie that it is a remake of a classic.  It isn't trying to be better than the original.  It is mainly just borrowing the plot which is a good one and great one for pure comedy.",1138579200,,1408,4.572

In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great), while the humor, the dialogues and the plot are just average if not slightly below average.

Strongly resembling Meet the Parents, it plays on white-black race relations.  Yawn... Boring...

Moreover, the characters are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting, not to mention that to call the ending ""predictable"" is the understatement of the year!

I thought Butterfly Effect was simply amazing but with ""Guess Who"" he fails to make a faint impression. This is easily the most skip worthy film I have seen in a while. It lacks humor and falls flat on it's face as far as acting,direction and screenplay goes.

2155195,4,B0003035CW,"I hate to admit that I actually watched an Ashton Kutcher movie (but, in my defense, it did have the very funny Bernie Mac in it), much less that I actually enjoyed it.  Not for Kutcher, of course, who makes Keanu Reeves look like a master thespian, but despite him.  Bernie Mac pretty much carries the movie single-handedly; every scene without him is something of a chore to get through.

The premise is very simple.  Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) is quite horrified when his daughter Theresa (Zoe Saldana) brings home her new boyfriend for her parents' twenty-fifth anniversary celebration.  Percy had checked up on our boy Simon Green (Kutcher) and was quite encouraged by his credit report and the fact that he worked for a prestigious investment firm (at least, he did work for a prestigious investment firm - but he quit just before making the trip to meet his prospective in-laws, a fact that no one, including Theresa, knows about yet).  Simon isn't what he was expecting at all, though - not by a long shot.  It has a lot to do with the fact that Simon is white, but let's face it - every father's worst nightmare is the thought of his baby girl bringing Ashton Kutcher home with her.  It's not even completely about race; the boy is just not right in the head, and Percy thinks he's hiding something (which he is).  This father takes extraordinary steps to make sure Simon and his little girl don't get up to any hanky-panky there in his house - and who can blame him for that?  As the days pass, things don't get any better, much comic hilarity ensues (capped off with a round of ethnic jokes told around the dinner table), and there's a big row that temporarily splits up both couples.  Wouldn't it be funny if, just once, a movie didn't go for the pat, obvious ending?  I think it would, but we'll have to wait a little longer to know for sure because Guess Who plays out just as you knew it would.

This is a comedy, and it doesn't try to be anything more than that.  Without Bernie Mac, it would have flopped like a fish out of water, but Bernie Mac can make anything funny, even scenes with Ashton Kutcher.  He really ought to get some kind of award for that - maybe a special Oscar for actually making an Ashton Kutcher film funny and enjoyable.",1130112000,2,2258,4.446601941747573

I don't think interracial relationships are as shocking as they once were, so Bernie Mac gave a believable performance as a Black father who was not exactly thrilled with his daughter dating outside of her race.

2155207,1,B0003035CW,"For me, it's not about the fact that this movie is supposed to be a light-hearted remake of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, or that it's a 'racial' version of Meet the Parents. I hadn't even seen that many previews of the movie. I just heard it was a good film, and I thought I'd check it out.

Perhaps if the black love interest in this movie were as 'black' as Sydney Poitier, it would hold a bit more water for me. Once again, though, we black women must battle the eurocentric beauty standard. A white man falls in love with a black woman. Really? I suppose I would have been more intrigued if the woman had kinky hair, wide hips, generous lips and an ethnic nose. This woman looked like a 'europeanized' version of a black woman. I mean, really, make her skin a tad lighter and she could have been white! You wouldn't even have to TOUCH her hair! Forget the fact that the movie wasn't funny, and that I laughed maybe once throughout. Forget the fact that Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher (both of whom I really like) are the leading names in such a watered-down film. I'm talking about the subliminals here. Why would the black father be so uptight about her daughter dating a white guy (notice how he glances around to see what neighbors might be looking when his daughter first steps into the yard with her white boyfriend?) when he lives in what is likely a predominantly white suburb? He's living the life successful white men live every day --- should he even be surprised that his daughter is dating a white man? I have an even harder time believing that, despite this affluent lifestyle the parents lead, we see the wife chucking it up with her very 'black' friends over at her sister's house. You just KNOW that folks like these have got to have some white friends --- so where are THEY in the film??? It all seems to contrived to me, particularly this Cosby-like black fantasy world of affluence and family togetherness. It all feels very made up. Cast Angie Stone as the love interest and I may take it more seriously.",1126483200,13,2028,4.451612903225806
2155208,4,B0003035CW,"Wow, the reviews panning this cute and entertaining film absolutely overwhelm me.  Folks, lighten up!  This is not a remake of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner""; it does borrow the premise from that Sixties classic of an interracial relationship, and a father having a hard time coming to grips with it.  But aside from that, GUESS WHO stands wonderfully on its own merits--and should be judged accordingly.

Bernie Mac as stern and proud papa Percy Jones steals every scene he's in, which is fine with me, as the actor has amazing comedic timing and panache.  Percy and his wife Marilyn (Judith Scott) are celebrating their 25th anniversary by renewing their wedding vows; on top of that, their eldest daughter Theresa (played by a very attractive Zoe Saldana) is bringing her boyfriend home from New York.  Percy just knows his baby girl is in love with a man just like himself:  aggressive, hardnosed, athletic. . .and black.  So when he actually meets his daughter's love interest, a somewhat nerdy guy named Simon (Ashton Kutcher)--a nerdy guy who's white--well, let's just say that's when all the fun starts.

And there's plenty of fun in GUESS WHO, as father and boyfriend square off in a battle of wits that had me howling with laughter.  This is a very funny film; some of the scenes, including the go-kart race and the family dinner, were hysterical.  This is a lighthearted comedy that will also warm your heart; for those expecting an epic to compare with Tracy and Hepburn, get a grip.

Ashton Kutcher is growing on me, as I'm not currently a huge fan of his.  He just always seems so dorky, no matter what role he is playing.  It's fitting for this movie, and I think he did well.

Better yet, have you imagined what would happen when you introduced your significant other to your parents? This is the backdrop for this movie, a comedy with some funny moments mixed together with a script that is mostly predictable.

This movie is similar to the 1967 classic, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and many viewers who enjoyed that movie will want to compare this movie to it. In ""Guess Who"", the same situation is presented, except this time a black woman played by actress Zoe Saldana is bringing home a white man, played by Ashton Kutcher, to meet her parents. Tensions are felt all around, but the person who is most uneasy is Percy Jones, played by actor Bernie Mac. He claims that it doesn't bother him, but he continues to look for ways to break his daughter and her fianc&eacute; up, even though he has always told his kids that they should be color blind and accepting of all people.

While Bernie Mack is struggling with his acceptance of his daughter's new boyfriend, he is also trying to plan a party where he and his wife (played by Judith Scott) will renew their wedding vows. Toward the end of the film, his wife gets upset at him and it looks like the party is off. Now, it is up to him to apologize and win back his wife's affections. It is here, at this point, that he realizes how much his wife means to him and how much his daughter means to her boyfriend. This subplot is, again, mostly predictable. But it at least fits into the movie's theme and keeps the movie flowing.

Bernie Mack, Zoe Saldana, and Judith Scott are all pretty good in this film and they have a good grip on their respective roles and the personification of their characters. My only reservations are with Ashton Kutcher, who plays the role of Simon Green. His performance seems a little off the mark and the chemistry between him and Zoe Saldana wasn't quite there. Saldana throws her heart into the role, but Kutcher seems like he doesn't rally want to be here.

Overall, this film is a good one and it does have some good comedic moments. Its greatest flaws are its predictability and formula- driven script. But I liked it enough to recommend. Bernie Mac's comedic talent alone is worth giving this movie a watch.",1125360000,3,2323,4.536992840095466

The jokes were forced out for the most part, and the actors looked like they were going through the motions. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the the leading male and female in this. At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father, and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'. Ashton was silly while trying to be funny, which is his style and personality. But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious. Ashton is just in over his head with this kind of acting.

In short, this is one I would suggest waiting to see on video. If you were thinking of a good evening out, I would suggest Hitch or go with a totally different genre of movie.",1125187200,,1218,4.413333333333333
2155219,4,B0003035CW,"A great comedy with perfect casting adds a twist to the old classic ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.""

Successful NY yuppie Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher) has a busy weekend ahead of him, he gets canned from his job and must find a way to impress his soon to be in-laws. But there is a snag, that good old racial divide rears its ugly head. Green's fiance, Theresa Jones (Zo Saldana) just happens to be of another race but that's where all the fun begins. Meet Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) a racist for the sake of his race but mostly just a stern and caring father who would probably not accept any man being good enough for his baby. Will they bond or disagree? Finding out is the fun part!

In yet another ""meet the parents"" farce issues of race are dealt with respectfully and with great humor. Bernie Mac is fantastic as the rigid and successful father. Perfectly matched to Mac's humor is the often ineptly funny Ashton Kutcher, together the actors feed one another and form a perfect comedy team. The other actors pale in comparison to Mac-Kutcher but they offer the proper support for the wise-cracks. Let the competition begin because it a great one!",1124928000,2,1151,4.555555555555555
2155220,2,B0003035CW,"As some other reviewers noted, this film has very little in common with the earlier film, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"".  In fact, this was a complete rip-off of ""Meet the Parents"" to degree that really surprised me.  The writer of ""Meet the Parents"" should ask for some royalties from ""Guess Who"".  Here are some of the similarities:

1) A boyfriend is coming to his girlfriend's parents home and plans to announce an engagement.

2) The father immediately dislikes the boyfriend and immediately begins trying to intimidate him.

3) The boyfriend begins spinning lies about his past to the parents.

4)  The father suspects the lies and dislikes the boyfriend even more.

5)  The father discovers something suggesting disturbing sexual practices by the boyfriend.

6)  The father is determined to keep the boyfriend from sleeping with his daughter.

7)  A wedding (or renewing of vows) is being planned to occur in the parents BACKYARD.

8)  Lies are discovered and the boyfriend is driven from the home.  He heads home via a train or a plane.

9)  For no apparent reason, the father suddenly changes his mind about the boyfriend and rushes to the train station (airport), where he talks the boyfriend into returning.

The racial situations are just for window dressing to throw a smokescreen over the obvious plagerism.

Having said all of the above, if plagerism doesn't bother you, you will find a few funny scenes, but nothing special.  Don't expect any significant commentary on race relations in America or any other deeper message.  This is the type of film that is only worth seeing if you can't find anything else that's interesting.  I guess I'm saying that it is better than staring at a blank TV screen and is not terrible, but it's just very average.

Ashton Kutcher gives a ""C"" performance and just isn't all that funny.  Bernie Mac is excellent and keeps the film above a 1 star rating.  The other others are just role players and give decent performances but nothing special",1124668800,5,1992,4.833827893175074
2155221,4,B0003035CW,"Disappointed by Meet The Fokkers, we were at first hesitant to get Guess Who. After reading reviews here, I was even more prepared to find another trite, tasteless bit of film fluff.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a very well done and touching film, in spite of its comedic overtones.

Bernie Mac gives one of his best performances yet, as the seemingly stern, overprotective and loving Percy Jones. In spite of his gruff and cranky surface, inside lies the soul of a man deeply committed to his home and family. His role plays off beautifully against Judith Scott as his wife. Although I felt hers was one of the weakest roles in the film, she managed to be the ideal foil for Percy.

Much has been said about the trite or superficial stereotypical racial handling of the subject matter in this film. I disagree. I found it to be one of the more realistic films of this type. Both Percy and Simon (Ashton Kutcher) create tensions relating to his being white in a very understated manner. The producers didn't go for the easy, but rather created a quieter tension, that leaves the viewer wondering how much is the dislike between Simon and Percy motivated by race or by other things entirely.

Simons fiancee, Zoe Saldana gives a fine sensitive performance as the daughter torn between needing her fathers approval and her deepening love for Simon. She's an actress to watch, I believe she has a great untapped range in her, that should lead to bigger, deeper roles.

This is a great film for whiling away a hot summers afternoon. The only problem I found with Guess Who, came near the end, where Percy's female in-laws, take the moral high ground and in what I feel was the only truly racist stereotyping of the entire film occurs.

I recommend this film for it's low key humor, thoughtful performances, and for the sheer pleasure of watching Bernie Mac hit his stride.",1124582400,4,1886,4.648648648648648

This is the first time I saw Ashton Kutcher do any meaningful acting.  About time.  His efforts receive valiant support from Bernie Mac's skill at taking the load off him.  Mac puts in another pretty good performance as an actor, and by also assuming the heavy lifting as the antagonist, he makes it easy for Kutcher to look like he knows what he's doing.

Whoever was in charge did an artful job of keeping the comedy flowing while making it help the story unfold rather than hinder it which is all too often the case in contemporary romantic comedies.

Better scenes pit the two men against each other in go-carts, and show their apologies in front of all of the women's friends.

Yet, the story the director chose to portray could have been fleshed out much better if they would have focused on some things.

2155241,3,B0003035CW,"To say this movie is not as bad as I was anticipating is actually my way of complimenting director Kevin Rodney Sullivan for his patently inoffensive, occasionally perceptive update of 1967's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"". Whereas Stanley Kramer's earlier film is often lambasted for deifying its principal character, the esteemed, tragically widowed black doctor portrayed by Sidney Poitier, the race-reversed 2005 film goes the opposite route by making its protagonist, a self-absorbed Wall Street trader named Simon Green, a morally flawed, buffoonish romantic.

The conceit of the switch is fine, but the execution is simply not as gutsy as the concept. Consequently it is useless to make any further comparisons between the movies as the former was written as a 1960's social statement at the height of the civil rights movement, while the latter feels like race is being used as a generic plot device for a series of soft-hearted comedy bits similar to those in the ""Meet the Parents/Fockers"" movies. The threadbare plot focuses on Simon, the upwardly mobile boyfriend of Theresa, a free-spirited photographer. Of course, he's white, she's black and they travel to New Jersey to meet her parents, Percy and Marilyn Jones, who are planning a celebration around their 25th anniversary and - color me surprised - don't know Simon is white.

What happens thereafter until the inevitable conclusion is relatively inconsequential, as most of the comedy is predictably derivative - the mistaken identity greeting; Percy and Simon having to share a bed (a pale rip-off of the much funnier ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles""); the testosterone-driven go-kart competition gone awry; a sexually questionable party organizer that recalls Martin Short's loopier turn in ""Father of the Bride""; the male-bonding all-nighter between Simon and Percy; and a hen-party of men-bashing women cackling and giving poor advice to Theresa and Marilyn (shades of ""Waiting to Exhale"").

An hour into the film, there is a surprisingly provocative dinner scene in which Simon tells a succession of ""black jokes"" at Percy's goading until he inevitably crosses the line to offensiveness. If the rest of the film maintained the edginess of that moment, it could have gained some much-needed resonance. But instead of a thoughtful look at contemporary racism, we have a ""fish out of water"" story that flows downstream. Yet, the movie somehow manages a genuine sense of goodwill by the end, for example, there is a subtle moment when Theresa explains Simon's work situation in surprising detail to her father and then catches herself caring about him before going further.

Bernie Mac plays Percy with his trademark comic bluster - hilariously brilliant on TV but here rather constrained by the conventions of his character and the weak-willed script. The female performances help the proceedings considerably - Zoe Saldana is refreshing as Theresa, exuding a Thandie Newton-like quality of dewiness but with greater verve; Judith Scott makes Marilyn the ideal wife and mother - sexy, no-nonsense and sympathetic; and Kellee Stewart makes her moments count as sassy little sister Keisha (she delivers the movie's best line when she first sees Simon: ""Oh my God, are we being audited?""). Unfortunately, like Adam Sandler and Ben Affleck, Ashton Kutcher is part of a generation of actors who suffer from a lack of dramatic gravitas. Although likeable at times, he lacks sufficient depth and texture to carry a movie with a social message, even one as watered-down as the one presented here.

The DVD is a fairly standard package that includes Sullivan's thoughtful commentary on an alternate track and a making-of featurette that reflects the actors' vaunted opinions of the movie's intended social message. There are a handful of deleted scenes, which honestly seem as good as what is left in the movie, as well as a disposable goof reel.

2155246,1,B0003035CW,"This is a review of the GUESS WHO DVD.  Not so much the movie, as of the DVD itself.

This GUESS WHO DVD opens with the usual time-stealers.

First, the DVD steals our time by forcing us to sit through two promos before we can get to the main menu.  Then when we think we can finally see GUESS WHO, we're forced to sit through two WARNINGS not to infringe copyright, then two DISCLAIMERS about the audio commentary.

Finally, I think I'm going to GUESS WHO.  Only, DVD manufacturing is so poor, the film skips and stalls fifty minutes into the film.  And I can't get to the main menu, because the DVD has disabled that feature.  You see the little stop sign in the corner of your TV as you attempt to return to the menu while watching the film.

So I can't go to the menu to try and return to the scene again, to see if the DVD won't skip a second time.  I must remove the DVD and sit through the promos and warnings and disclaimers once again.

I was unable to see GUESS WHO beyond fifty minutes.  Too bad, because it seemed an okay film.  But the quesion remains, why do SO MANY DVDs skip and stall?

If DVDs are so fragile, why don't CDs and CD-ROMs have this problem?

There was a theory in VIDEO magazine in the 1980s that the studios were releasing poor quality VHS tapes because they didn't want consumers to build longterm libraries.  That makes sense.

Remember, the studios never wanted to sell their movies, they only wanted to rent tapes to video stores.  It was a series of court cases in the 1970s/80s concerning antitrust, restraint of trade, and fair use in copyright, (such as the Sony Betamax case) that barred the studios from restricting the trade of independent video stores.

Yet the studios made a bundle when people built tape libraries.  Another bundle now that people are replacing their fragile tapes with fragile DVDs.

I can see why the studios don't want to manufacture decent quality DVDs, lest consumers have permanent movies floating around for decades.  Studios earn nothing on the sale of used DVDs.  Better for them to manufacture fragile DVDs that won't last, so consumers will more easily replace their scratchy DVDs when the next format comes along.

I'm really tired of SO MANY rental DVDs skipping and stalling, and SO MANY DVDs having promos I can't bypass.  I wish there was more consumer outrage against these crappy studio practices.

I'd give GUESS WHO three stars (based on the first 50 minutes) but must deduct for the (intentionally?) poor manufacturing.",1123113600,17,2503,4.581081081081081
2155247,4,B0003035CW,"Granted, it would be easy to dismiss ""Guess Who"" as a tacky flip of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?""  But then no one needs to tell Bernie Mac that he is no Spencer Tracy anymore than the difference had to be brought to Steve Martin's attention when he remade ""Father of the Bride.""  Since he quits his job two minutes into the film Ashton Kutcher's character is not going to be mistaken for the one played by Sidney Poitier, but then the race of Kutcher's character is not held against him.  Judith Scott is not trying to compare to Katharine Hepburn and definitely makes her own impression, but the most fortunate cast member has to be Zo Salda&ntilde;a who was never going to be hurt by comparisons to Katharine Houghton.  More importantly, her character makes the best impression of the bunch, and while this 2005 comedy is about an African-American father trying to deal with the fact his daughter wants to marry a ""white boy,"" do not forget that the viewing audience also has to approve of the couple as well.  Fortunately, Theresa Jones is as much of a catch as her mother, Marilyn, and that at least gives Simon Green and Percy Jones something to agree about--eventually.

Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back "") comments that while race is the hook of ""Guess Who,"" that love is the melody.  He is right, and that is what saves this film from turning into a regrettable remake.  The trailer emphasizes the go-cart race between Percy and Simon, but while that seen provides laughs it is relatively unimportant to the central dynamic of the film (just as the cross-dressing scene is unnecessary to add to the inherent tension of the situation).  Yes, Percy is put off that Theresa did not say she was bringing home a white boy, but Percy clearly is not going to be happy with anybody who wants to sleep under his roof and try to sneak around and do who knows exactly what in the middle of the night.  Plus Percy knows that Simon is hiding some things and lying is not a question of race.

The screenplay by David Ronn & Jay Scherick and Peter Tolan has a couple of things going for it that allows ""Guess Who"" to move beyond its 1967 ancestor.  First, we are given scenes establishing Simon and Theresa as a couple in love before they show up on daddy's doorstep.  Simon also gets to articulate exactly why he would love someone with whom he clearly has nothing in common.  Consequently, we totally buy the relationship, which has been going on for months and is not something that sprung up during a short vacation.  Second, the reason Theresa has dragged Simon home is because her parents are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary with a renewal of their vows.  That means Percy has other headaches besides Theresa's boyfriend, and one of the best scenes comes in the film when the boys have each stepped over the line and Marilyn goes to her sister's house, dragging Theresa along, for lots of drinks with her wonderful support group.

Most importantly, the best humor in ""Guess Who"" comes from the characters and not their race.  Obviously the key dynamic is between Mac and Kutcher, but Mac has strong rapports with Scott and Salda&ntilde;a as well, which is the respect in which this film is most like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" (where Houghton had the advantage of being Hepburn's niece).  The shift from friction to family is predictable in films such as this, but that does not stop it from being effective because I buy the characters and have no trouble rooting for all four of them to reach the requisite happy ending.  In the final analysis, while inspired by an earlier film, ""Guess Who"" carves out its own path and becomes an enjoyable comedy; that is to say, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would going in, and that is a pleasant surprise given how disappointing so many movies are where the trailer is better than the film.  I am happy to report that is decidedly not the case here.

Final note: My most serious quibble with the script comes in the dinner scene where Percy pushes Simon into telling racial jokes.  While the first few jokes are perfect for the situation, I really think that the inevitable point where Simon goes too far is one joke earlier than when the film thinks that it is (and in the joke that goes too far the third part does not fit the other two, plus is obviously untrue just on the basis of the people sitting in the room, so that it is as stupid as it is racist).  Fortunately it is the telling of the jokes and not the jokes themselves that are the point of the scene, so this remains a quibble and not a cause for the reading of the riot act.",1123027200,,4640,4.5227272727272725
2155248,4,B0003035CW,"Almost forty years after the Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) a remake is appropriate with the same racial theme, but this time the situation is reversed.  It is time for the Caucasian, Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher), to visit his future African-American family-in-law for the first time.  Much has changed since 1967 when Sidney Poitier visited Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, yet some of the racial tensions still linger within the society.  Kevin Rodney Sullivan, who some recognize from How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998), decides to bring comic relief into these racial tensions.

The stress of visiting ones future father-in-law can be overwhelming.  On top of this stress, Simon quits his prestigious job at the investment firm JP Oliver, an obvious allusion towards JP Morgan.  In addition, Simon does not inform his fiance Theresa Jones (Zoe Saldana) about his recent unemployment while they plan on telling her parents about their engagement at the parents 25th Wedding Anniversary.  Simon manages the situation very well, a sign that he has a very high stress level.  However, his stress level is about to be tested when he is about to meet Theresa's overly protective father, Percy Jones (Bernie Mac), for the first time.

Meanwhile, Percy checks out Simon's credit history, as he is a bank loan officer, and this impresses him.  Percy is also excited about Simon working at JP Oliver, but does not know that he has quit. Bernie Mac, who often comes across a grand character, does a good job here down-playing his strong persona.  This helps the film deliver a better cinematic experience, as the focus is on all the members of the family.

The first encounter between Simon and Percy is a scene with mixed identities, which will certainly bring the audience to laughter.  The film continues to play with situational comedy that seems familiar with the comedy on many sitcoms.  Nonetheless, there are moments when the comedy actually elevates beyond sitcom level, and even brings a tear to the eye.  It is important that the audience does not forget the power of laughter, as it can help bring people together.  Sullivan does exactly this with Guess Who where he lets the comedy do the talking while presenting the racial issues.

There are several situations in the film where Sullivan presents interesting notions in regards to human differences such as in the cab on the way to Theresa's parents and the night when they have supper together with Theresa's grandfather.  These situations deliver numerous opportunities to further extend to the racial tensions within the society.  Unfortunately, the film does not take any risks by exploring these new territories, which leaves the film behind from being a finer cinematic experience.  Even so, the film succeeds in presenting an enjoyable film that can continue to soften the rigid notions that still linger within society.",1123027200,8,2897,5.058947368421053

2155252,3,B0003035CW,"""Guess who"" has some very funny scenes and Bernie mac and Ashton Kutcher  are a good comedy tag team. But Some boring drawn out scenes hurt the flow of this movie and hurts it overall.

The Plot-""Guess who"" is about a white man named Simon(Kutcher) who works on Wall street and has a black girlfriend named teresa and the couple go to her fathers (who is named Percy(bernie mac) house and spend the weekend because he is renewing his marraige vows with his wife.

Little does simon know that Percy is a strict man and tries to discourage simon in various ways while he is at his house and tries to make him look like a liar who is racist.

Positives-This movie does have some funny scenes. Here is a look at some

-The first meeting between Simon and percy is when Simon and his girlfriend pull up to her fathers driveway and Percy thinks that the Black Taxi cab driver is her boyfriend and Percy makes simon look stupid by telling him ""UHM Sir you can drop the bags inside the livingroom""

-Simon and his girlfriend are in the bedroom and simon gets the urge to play around with her red lingerie and he puts it on, gets on his knees on the bed and teresa tries to take it back and then Percy walks in on them.

-Simon says he once drove for NASCAR which is a lie and Percy challenges him to a Go-Cart Race which ends very funny.

-While Simon is attending dinner with teresa's family Percy urges Simon to say black jokes which starts innocent enough but ends with Percy and his father offended.

These are some of the funny scenes of the movie there are more but these are the highlights.

Negatives-When the movie is not trying to be funny it's very sappy and annoying.

-For example after Simon escapes from the basement(where he was sharing a bed with percy) he goes with teresa to a bridge and start to chat about their past relationships and how much they care for each other, Which lasts about 10 minutes...it's not funny and it feels filler and ruins the flow of the comedy.

-percy's wife and simons girlfriend are mad at their men and go to a friends house, again we are hit with another 10 minute not funny scene with just the women chatting about how useless men are.

These Scenes dearly mess up this movie and ruin the flow and no you don't get these scenes back to back you get one after a couple of funny scenes and that hurts the pacing of the film.

The Ending is another negative of this film as it's been done hundreds and hundreds of times and is so cliche' it's annoying.

conclusion-This film has some very funny scenes and again i will say that Mac and Kutcher play off each other very well but some long filler scenes hurt the flow of the movie and it's cliche' ending seals it as an average film.

Alot of people didn't like the movie because the ""Black man, white woman"" courtship was tooken out and replaced.

The plot wasn't all that great due to the fact that Teresa's(Zoe) first interracial relationship was with Simon(Ashton).

The first and most important problem is that the topic and main subject of dialogue is an anachronism.  Interrational relationships used to be an issue and the original film was a smart approach to tough subject matter.  It opened the issue up for discussion among the masses.  Because  it is a dead issue this remake attempts to inject a dose of humor.  The result is campy mess. There is little in this DVD to be entertained by, let alone challenged.  Bernie Mac is funny and offers a couple of lines that produce a chuckle.  He should be in more true comedy films.  Ashton Kutcher is unwatchable, i.e. the new Adam Sandler.

The sound guys did an amazing job with all of the bad weather and all.  The line up is my dream (with respect to Curt Winter) Guess Who and they did not disappoint .

2155260,3,B0003035CW,"A comic twist to the 1967 Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Houghton ground-breaking picture Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. This time around the proverbial shoe is on the other foot as Ashton Kutcher (a.k.a. Simon Green) tries to finagle his way into the hearts of the Percy Jones Family; patriarch by Mr. Bernie Mac.

Simon Green is an upwardly mobile individual, full of potential and possessing the two things that Percy Jones demands in potential suitors for his daughter: (1) an excellent credit report, and (2) a job. Of course, after meeting Simon, Percy realizes that he might have a third requirement. However, unbeknownst to everyone involved, Simon has just quit his job. Simon has joined his fiance, Theresa, on her parent's 25th wedding anniversary; they are planning to use this event to announce their own engagement.

Percy Jones resides in an upper income neighborhood, and wants nothing but the best for the little girl. Although, the sight of his future son-in-law does take him back. As in the first film, the mothers are easier to win over. However, Percy is skeptical to say the least. After some very embarrassing circumstances, both Percy and Simon are left without their significant other; this provides the perfect opportunity for them to get to know one another. After a long heart-to-heart conversation, Percy realizes that Simon, though jobless, does love his daughter.

The events that follow are corny, but comical. I did enjoy this film. The reversal of switching to a black family dealing with a white fiance was original enough, and Bernie Mac is Pure Genius. I think you will enjoy this film as well, if you give it a chance.

2155264,4,B0003035CW,"Great escapist fantasy.

Went with my partner to this one, and it was very much a 'meet the parents' type comedy without so much as a skerrik of the original ""Guess Who's coming to dinner"".

Light hearted and fluffy with a few unbelievable references to the racism the inter-racial couple have endured, it's much more in the ""Meet The Parent's"" vein of comedic relief.

And Ashton Kutchner is extremely funny, although one winces at the occasional ""Punk'd"" overt reference.  Hoot-worthy comic performance, and excessively handsome, it's a girlie film, but with enough humour to make it a tolerable 'couples' movie.

A feel good romantic comedy.

Ashton Kutchner & his  fiancee played by beautiful Zo Sandaa are returning to her parents house for the parents 25th wedding anniversary. Planning to reveal their engagement, all is postponed when the fact that Kutchner isn't black is a BIG deal to her dad.

Hilarious escapades ensue, and it should please audiences looking for a quick laugh.

Deep and thoughtful it is not, but you oughtta been warned off when you saw Ashton Kutchners name in the credits, guys! I mean, come on!

He plays a variation on the character we last saw in the Brittany Murphy/Kutchner comedy Just Married - but this time, he's a lot funnier. Oh, and he's fairly attractive as well, did I mention that?!

Should I end my review on a rant about the Demi Moore connection? Nah, I'll leave it.

A lot of it has been done before by Ben Stiller, but it still is good for a laugh, if not entirely fresh material. Go with your girlfriends or go with your partner, but don't look for more than a little bit of escapist fluff & floss.

2155266,2,B0003035CW,"Simon (Ashton Kutcher) and his girlfriend, Theresa (Zoe Saldana) are going to suburban New Jersey to meet her parents on the weekend of their 25th Anniversary. During the ride there, he learns that she hasn't told her father that he is white. Upon meeting her parents (Bernie Mac and Judith Scott), her father, Percy immediately takes a disliking to him. He doesn't trust him but insists it's not because he is white. Throughout the weekend, events escalate until no one is talking to anyone else and everyone has to look into their hearts and figure out why they love each other.

""Guess Who"" is a strange project for Hollywood. Making remakes and `reinterpretations' is nothing new. Hollywood seems to dislike attempts to create anything new, preferring sequels and remakes. Many years ago, musicals were often made from dramas and comedies. Currently, a couple of films are being made of hit Broadway musicals based on comedies. But why make a comedy based on a drama from the late 60s, starring Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier. Cutting edge for its time, ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" is an interesting film, for the time, but now appears very dated. Presumably, the filmmakers were attracted to the thought of updating the material and mining it for laughs.

The `updating' comes from switching the races of all characters. Instead of a white woman taking a black man home to meet her parents, a black woman takes a white man home to meet her parents. This is pretty much the extent of the filmmaker's attempts to update the material. Percy's family lives in a suburban home which could have been lifted out of the original drama. His values are pretty much from the late 60s as well. Before he meets Simon, Percy is excited because he does a credit report on the new boyfriend and learns that he works with a large stock brokerage and has a great future. When he first meets Simon, he doesn't like him because of the color of his skin. Simon and Theresa are given the more modern sensibilities. They are living in a modern loft, she's an artist, they talk a lot about their feelings. There is a single moment in which Theresa tells her father that she and Simon are frequently treated differently by other people. This is pretty much the only attempt to address the modern aspect of two people living in an interracial relationship.

All of this would be excusable, I guess, if the film were extremely funny. Instead, the filmmakers seem intent on recycling situations from ""Meet The Parents"", but watering the down until they resemble something more like ""Father of The Bride"". Simon is nervous when he first meets Percy, so naturally he lies about sports. He concocts a ludicrous, and frankly strange, lie about working with Jeff Gordon and NASCAR drivers. You can probably guess where that joke will go. Simon quits his job the day before he goes to meet her parents. Again, you can probably guess where this will lead the action. Percy doesn't trust Simon, so he sleeps with him in a sofa bed in the basement.  Percy doesn't want to dance the tango with his wife at the ceremony and Simon's mom ran a dance studio. I wonder where that will go. The finale is also one of the most forced and contrived I have seen in some time.

The filmmakers have relied on cheap sitcom laughs and situations, robbing the film of any depth and any laughs.

I too give it 3 stars (though out of 5). The movie not only greatly exceeded my expectations but I actually found myself laughing and understanding the couples interacial woes. Simon (Krutcher) is the well meaning boyfriend/fiance who has (had) a great job and future ahead of him. Percy (Mac) is the over protective father, who would be so regardless of what Simon refers to as a ""pigment challanged"" guy.

The secondary characters (funny that one of them includes Zoe) fill their roles quite well. Theressa (Zoe) has put together another solid performance in what is one of her bigger roles (earlier impressive turns have been Pirates of the Carribean and more recently The Terminal). The mother does a routine but solid job nonetheless as the understanding parent who just wants the best for her daughter.

The only downfall is that the story lacks the edge and depth in the what could have been an important statement for interacial relationships. Instead the movie mostly tip-toes or makes light of the situation which I suppose makes it more watchable  than culturally challenging. When the movie chooses to acknowledge the importance of the racial issue it does so well (the dinner table sequence with Simon telling racial jokes and the inevitable fight between Simon and Theressa). Also the fact that Simon comes from a single parent home (his father we learn left when he was 3) and Theressa comes from a middle class, home owning, career having, parents of 25 years background makes the story much more interesting.

Another 1/2 hour focused on the above issues would have given the film more credibility and would have made for a much better statement but for what its worth the film is a joy to watch.",1112486400,,1977,4.769005847953216

What ever happened to ingenuity and originality in filmmaking? Look elsewhere.",1111968000,19,739,4.7734375
2155275,5,B0003035CW,"""Guess Who"" is funny! Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are a great comedic team. It is a very impressive retake on ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"".",1111795200,,143,4.538461538461538
2155276,2,B0003035CW,"""Guess Who"" is a mere two words of the original title, ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner."" Too bad it has an even smaller fraction of the comic value. This awkward racial comedy is watered down and goofed up, and only Bernie Mac's performance gets a chance to shine. Too bad he wasn't opposite the Wilson brothers.

The original 1967 race comedy had a white girl bringing her African-American fiancee home. This time there is a reversal: Percy (Bernie Mac) and wife Marilyn (Judith Scott) are sort-of-eagerly awaiting the arrival of their young daughter Teresa (Zoe Saldana), who is supposed to bring her fiancee there. They expected a nice, financially stable, black man. What they get: A goofy, well-to-do white guy, Simon (Ashton Kutcher).

Percy isn't exactly pleased with this, especially after some ""Meet the Parents"" stunts like Simon prancing around in lingerie. He does have to admit that Simon's past career has been ""a thing of beauty,"" but more problems arise when they learn that Simon has actually quit his job recently.

I'm not sure why they bill ""Guess Who"" as a remake. It has almost nothing in common with the original -- even the title feels goofily incomplete. (""Guess Who""? Guess who what?) The hot-button race relations are replaced with oddball slapstick. And Sidney Poitier's elegant performance is replaced by... Ashton Kutcher. I think the problems are obvious.

But even taken by itself, ""Guess Who"" feels like a race-based version of ""Meet the Parents,"" with the awkward young man meeting his future in-laws, except with an even thinner storyline. Kevin Rodney Sullivan simply doesn't seem to have enough funny scenarios to flesh out a simple storyline, so he fills it in with sitcommish antics and awkward interactions.

There is one redeeming factor to this movie -- outside the framework of the 1960s, it displays that racism is not restricted to one race. Unfortunately, it gets mired in scenes like Mac and Kutcher sharing a bed in the basement. It could have had a strong message, but it chickens out.

The two leads are a study in opposites. Bernie Mac gives a really fun performance as the father-in-law from hell, and he plays the role with such aplomb that he redeems many a flagging scene. Kutcher, on the other hand, hasn't made a single good career decision since signing onto ""That 70s Show,"" and this isn't going to break the trend. In ""Guess Who,"" he is bland. Very bland. Bland bland bland. Forget white -- he's white bread.

""Guess Who"" won't keep you guessing -- this lame comedy is strictly by the numbers. It has the occasional moments of excellence, but besides Mac's performance, it's a bomb that probably has Poitier rolling his eyes.",1111708800,40,2683,4.89647577092511
2155277,4,B0003035CW,"I enjoyed this movie for two reasons: First, The plot of this movie touch on some real issues between the races and what happens when there are bigotry on both sides. The realistic and funny way it is deal with. Second,The casting of Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana were just perfect. Besides the movie being funny and serious at the same time. It is really great.",1111708800,3,378,4.492753623188406
2155278,4,B0003035CW,"Yeah, the picture quality of the DVD isn't what it could be, but once these five seasoned pros take the stage in Winnipeg, it doesn't make any difference. This really is great. From ""Running Back to Saskatoon"" on through the anthemic ""Share The Land,"" Cummings, Bachman, McDougall, Wallace and Peterson are all in top form. What really surprised me (since I never had the chance to see the band live back in the Seventies) is hearing and seeing how great a guitarist Donnie McDougall is. Randy Bachman, sure, he's as terrific here as I thought he'd be, but McDougall holds his own with him just fine and his solos on ""Guns, Guns, Guns"" (featured in the ""Bonus Songs"" section) really smoke!

Reunions of bands from the 60s, 70s and 80s often end up being very disappointing, but the Guess Who reunion, as seen on this DVD, is a thrill to watch, great to sing along with and, for this 50-something, a great reason to strap on the air-guitar and rock with the band. Real fine!",1110240000,20,973,4.56
2155279,2,B0003035CW,"Oh dear, what can the matter be?  The picture quality is by far the worst one I have seen for any DVD, period.  What were they using for a camera(s)?  It appears as if their equipment was purchased at Walmart or obtained from a garage sale!

I have a 51"" HDTV Toshiba that is capable of illustrating a brilliant screen picture.  My music DVDs are transformed into a personalized concert and becomes the next best thing to actually being in the audience.  This is not the case with this poor and inexcusable piece of work.

This ""Guess Who"" concert should not be viewed on a screen larger than 12 inches. The pixels that comprise the picture are so noticeable that one starts to feel nauseated by watching it. Guess What? I had to turn off the TV and finish the show without a picture to enjoy it.

Another annoying aspect was the little interviews between some of the songs.  Why ruin the feel and mood of the event with this lame procedure?  Nobody wants to hear them talk in the middle of it.  Save it for the Special Features next time.  Speaking of next time, one DVD by them, is more than plenty.

Buy the CD, not the DVD.",1110067200,7,1127,4.3349282296650715

The Fact The Band Chose To Ride Out Weather Conditions At This Show Proves How Dedicated They Were To The Fans. You Can't Say That About A Lot Other Bands. It's Great To See A Group Of Guys Having Fun And Seemingly Not Doing It For The Money (Gene $immon$, Take Note). The Guess Who Kicks Ass And This DVD Proves It.

2155281,5,B0003035CW,"I was lucky enough to both see this band in Montreal on the 2000 tour and catch the CBC special after the tour wrapped up. This is an extended version of the special, and a magical night it was for Winnipegers and GW fans everywhere. The night they played Montreal, the video cameras were on them as they were headed to the stage, and the thunder that came from the audience would make you think God had approached the stage...Bachman and Cummings are the Lennon & McCartney of the Great White North, and from the performances that night and on the CD...they're playing better than they ever did the first time around (and I had seen them back in 1971). Some people may consider Mr. Cummings a bit full of himself...but he's earned it if he comes across that way...the legendary material he and Randy (and all his other collaborators in the band including the late Kurt Winter) have given us over the years is some truly great rock & roll...this band deserves a spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame...if the powers that be ever get their heads in the right geographical location. The morning after I saw the Guess Who in Montreal, the morning guy on CHOM-FM said it all: ""I've been to a ton of concerts over the years, but I've never been to a show where I sang along with every single song all the way through... but I did last night."" This is one of those shows...worth your money and worth them taking it on the road again next year (and hopefully to the US as well as Canada...if not, I guess I'll just travel north again). Bravo Burton, Randy, Bill, Donnie and Garry. After 35, nearly 40 years I am still a solid fan!",1101772800,70,1622,4.374172185430464
2155282,4,B0003035CW,"I did not attend the concert so hold no bias from being there.  This DVD features good video, especially for an outdoor concert and good sound.  Not on par with exceptioanl DVD's like those from the Eagles, Beegees, Styx, Fleetwood Mac, etc but still very enjoyable with no critical flaws.  I thought the instrumentals overwhelmed the vocals a bit.  Exceptioanl selection of songs, I recongnized each one upon hearing it even though I didn't recognize the name of the tune from the DVD jacket. The rehearsal hall bonus was very amusing and enlightening for a non musician such as me.  This is a solid 4+ out of 5 and definitely a keeper.",1101427200,8,637,4.651785714285714
2155283,5,B0003035CW,"As I was shopping with my Mom, I spotted the newly released Guess Who DVD, Running Back Thru Canada, which was filmed at the Goldeyes' baseball park in Winnipeg, in June, 2000. I was at the concert and I will never forget it. I can recall the darkening, menacing skies, with lightening flickering all over the area. Would we be spared from a downpour? We weren't, but with an unforcasted intermission, the show went on. The ten-minute intermission lasted over an hour due to the weather. Fortunately, the rain didn't last all evening. They actually risked electrocution by playing on instead of calling it a night, which made the evening all the more special. From watching the DVD commentary in between songs, the band was actually more concerned about the wind picking up and blowing apart the covered stage.

The band sounded fantastic. You might expect the sound at an outdoor show to be mediocre, but that wasn't the case from I stood, on the field. Seeing Randy Bachman play live only enhanced, in my mind, his status as a guitar virtuoso. Witness his euphoric, dazzling soloing on the jam part of American Woman. The Guess Who are my favorite Canadian band and at this warm summer evening show, I was in my glory. I only wish they had played another encore. Clearly, they left the audience wanting more. I know I would see them again and again and again, if I could.

The Guess Who have a huge amount of strong material, much more than they could play in a show. Some of the lesser known, but equally appealing songs that were played included: Rain Dance, Guns Guns Guns, Talisman and Glamour Boy. Also included was the Bachman-penned BTO hit, Takin' Care of Business and Takin' Care of Number One.

The now swelte Bachman looked liked a well-fed grandfather, with the beard and a bit too much girth. Donnie McDoougall and Bill Wallace on guitar and bass, respectively, didn't look anywhere near their 50-something years from my vantage point. Burton Cummings looked like he was in his 40s. Drummer Gary Peterson looked like he could lose a lot of weight, but he was solid in his performance and that's all that really matters.

There are some things you see in the DVD that I didn't notice from the show. During the American Woman jam, Bachman took a drumstick from Cummings and used it to run up and down the fretboard, which resulted in a string breaking, You suddenly see the broken string swaying by itself in the camera close-up.

There are a couple of things about the DVD that I was disappointed in. The concert was originally filmed for a 2-hour television broadcast. Consequently, six of the tracks are not part of the main feature, but they are relegated to the bonus section of the disc. It would have been better if all 21 tracks were played sequentially. There an inlay card, but no extensive liner notes. There's nothing that actually tells you who is in the lineup on the card.

The DVD also includes an interview and footage from one of their rehearsals. Although the concert was already aired on TV, I'm glad I purcased the DVD and I know I will watch it over and over again.",1100044800,9,3100,4.627272727272727
