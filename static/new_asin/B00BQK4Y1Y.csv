The center spoke that holds the dvd's in place was broken into 4 pieces that were moving inside the container.  It made noise even before the dvd was opened.  I have no way to secure the dvd's inside.",1372032000,,273,4.42
5666513,1,B00BQK4Y1Y,I have collected all Ghost Hunters DVD's and have tolerated the absolutely crappy DVD cases they use. But this time I have had enough. The 4th CD in my set had the last 2 episodes and extended/deleted scenes. The 2 episodes were completely useless because the audio and video were out of synch with each other. How can something like that get past quality control? It will be a cold day in Hell when I ever buy another Ghost Hunters DVD set. Prospective buyers beware.,1371945600,7,468,4.517647058823529
5666514,5,B00BQK4Y1Y,I ordered season 8.2 of TAPS. It has four discs. The first three work perfectly but disc four does not. So i contacted Amazon to get a replacement. They were great about the return and even gave me free 2 DAY shipping. So i got the replacement this morning i popped in disc four and same problem so i put it in my ps3 still would not play. Then i put it in my other dvd player and its the disc. There were no scratches or finger prints. I was thinking about contacting Amazon again about this issue but its only one disc with two episodes that i can watch on you tube.,1371600000,9,568,4.035398230088496

But Disc 4 is so out-of-synch (audio v. visual) that you can't follow the show.  Not sure how SyFy released this bad batch.  Amazon should pull it until a functional batch is ready for sale.",1371254400,11,323,4.333333333333333

5666535,3,B00BQK4Y1Y,I have not purchased this item. I was looking here to do so but now I won't after seeing that everyone has problems viewing the dvds. I wanted to say that I checked this set out at the local library and out of the 4 discs only disc two would play on my laptop. I will say they were scratched a bit as happens with loner dvds but I was able to play disc one on my mobile dvd player and the same with disc 3 but that one kept stopping and going. I thought maybe the dvds were formatted differently  but now I see it is a manufacturing flaw of some sort. Very disappointing. I won't be buying this item after all. : (,1418169600,,614,3.912

5666540,5,B00BQK4Y1Y,Ghost hunter is a fun paranormal show. I like the fact that they go in to disprove a haunting. I also like the fact that they do use any so call person who can talk to the other side. They use technology to prove their findings,1411862400,,227,3.9565217391304346

5666548,5,B00BQK4Y1Y,Love this show. I was just disappointed that the case part was broken when arrived. The circle thing that holds the disc's in place. Other than that good.,1406678400,,154,4.535714285714286
5666549,3,B00BQK4Y1Y,"I had no trouble with disc 4 like some of the other reviews indicate. I may have been lucky. The discs were loose in the case however and the case was broken. It seems like my other volumes of this show have all suffered from cheap dvd cases so this is no surprise. The content worked however and all the shows played with no problems.

I will tell you that my chief complaint about this show is the annoying music. This is a show you  want to watch late when others may be asleep. The tribal like drumming and loud crescendos at seemingly inappropriate points during the show are just annoying. I think some music would be necessary  but I hate the fact that the music competes with the dialogue forcing you to either turn it up  loud or strain to hear the actual show.

 That being said I would rather go along trying to hear the ghosts as the investigation ensues. They make it seem like a treat when they pause the music long enough for me to hear. In some cases the music roars as the investigator proclaims ""what the f was that"" while I sit there feeling left out. So even though I cannot imagine a show with no music in the case of Ghost Hunters it is a slippery slope.  I think a much lower volume less intense sound track that does not interfere with the enjoyment of the show would be much better. On the up side I do see improvement in other aspects of the program when compared to early seasons. The audio is much better overall and the technology has improved.",1405296000,,1473,4.276978417266187
5666550,4,B00BQK4Y1Y,"Part 2 didn't have Grant.  I can see the show getting better as time goes on, such a big adjustment to make and it was sad to just see Jason walking from his van without Grant at the beginning of the DVD.  The cases on Part 2 were great - very indepth and a lot of evidence is found.  There are even some really funny scenes so I hope they continue to keep humourous situations in each episode.  Most of them get put in the Deleted Scenes.  Love Jason's daughter - Hailey - hope she stays involved alot with Amy going on maternity leave.

I have a problem with 2 of the investigators.  I just don't want to watch episodes with these 2 particular investigators.

Ghost Hunters has come a long way and will continue to go far.  Kudos guys!!!",1403654400,,739,4.2214285714285715

5666552,5,B00BQK4Y1Y,"Well, I have been wanting to see Grant's last cases and figured out this was that last season he is on.  As you can see from the picture on the box, at this time of this season, he has already completed all the shows he was scheduled for.  I like Ghost Hunters and even though I was thinking it might have lost something after he departed, which it did, the other team members are trying to find the better way for the show to run without him.  Great season.",1400976000,,458,4.123595505617978

They ONLY reason this gets 4 stars is because the storage case was BROKEN yet again.  This makes the 3rd 1/2season in a row that the case busted one way or another.

People return their bad dvds and they re-sell them!  Still love the show.  It's too bad the digital eps got pulled.  Very mysterious.  I would have prefered to buy this digital and avoid the quality issues. I think Grant left the show and they must be fighting over copyright control...  I emailed Syfy and asked them to put them back.  If I get a nice set of dvds next time, I will tell all.  The newest episodes are still really good even after Grant left. *doesn't believe in ghosts but loves this show oodles*  Ghost Hunters is my tv comfort food.

Update 3 months later:  Okay, this show has a shocking lack of concern for quality which has run through multiple seasons, but I am trying not to become bitter.",1376092800,,884,4.284848484848485

Would someone please let me know if the ones that may be purchased one episode at a time are okay.  If they are, I will buy them at some point.  That would be the last...two of Season 8, I believe.

5666581,2,B00BQK4Y1Y,"I love Ghost Hunters and if I was reviewing the show this would show five stars.  However, I think its more important to review the DVD itself at this point.  Each of the last three seasons I have experienced serious problems with at least one disc.  The season 6 part 2 blu-ray third disc contained errors that would not allow me to get past the first few minutes of the first episode and the other episodes would not play either.

Season 7 had similar issues on two discs but my dvd player was able to fight through them.

Season 8 part 2 contained a new error.  On the last disc the video play back halted every few seconds,  however the audio played fine.  This resulted in the audio gradually getting further and further ahead of the video and basically unwatchable episodes.

The systems for holding the discs in place in the DVD cases (which for some reason they change every year) have also been week and/or damaged on several other seasons.

I own every season and the two full length Halloween specials.  However, the last three season's DVD/blu-rays having these issues makes it unlikely that I will continue this.  Syfy needs to get its act together and produce quality products or they will have lost a loyal viewer/customer.  On top of all this they don't even offer the episodes for digital download/viewing.

I won't tell you to not to buy this.  However, I will tell you not to buy it if you don't want to deal with the possibility sending it back.",1374364800,,1465,4.538167938931298

8572629,2,B00BQK4Y1Y,"I was really looking forward to buying this DVD set!  The main reason is because I used to live & work in Rochester, NY.  I worked at the Rochester Public Library (where they investigated) & it was my very 'first' job when I was 18 years old.  So, it was VERY special since I have been a huge fan of the show since it all began.  The disk that it is on is damaged & no one seems to make any effort to 'fix' the problem!!  I don't know who manufactures the DVD's, but I wish they would LISTEN!!!",1429401600,,494,3.9494949494949494
