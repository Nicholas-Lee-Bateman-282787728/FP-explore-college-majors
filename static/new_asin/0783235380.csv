65570,4,0783235380,I watched this movie on HBO and cant wait to own it. I think it is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It was funny and there was so much chemistry between Ben Affleck and sandra bulluck... I just really  liked this movie.,954720000,,238,3.836734693877551
65571,3,0783235380,I usually like movies that Sandra Bullock is in but this movie was not in my taste of movies. I say if you really want to see this movie then see it.,954633600,,149,3.6875
65572,5,0783235380,"""Forces of Nature"" is a delightful romantic comedy about a young man, Ben Holmes, (portrayed by Ben Affleck) who is held back by the forces of mother nature on his way to his wedding.  But while on this whirlwind of  a journey he just happens to be seatted next to the eye of the hurrican  herself (portrayed by Sandra Bullock.) The duo travel alongside eachother  in a series of unlikly comic mishaps that makes Ben queastion his thoughts  of being with just one person for the rest of your life.  This will be a  movie that you will never forget, so hold on tight cause the wild adventure  is about to begin!",951609600,2,610,4.383928571428571
65573,2,0783235380,"forces of nature is a movie that just isn't very good.  The plot seems ok at first but as the movie progresses it doesn't really build up to an anticipated climax.  The relationship between Bullock and Affleck is forced  and does not come naturally.  It seems as if there is not much passion or  forbidden love between the two the way the movie builds it up to be.  I  think Affleck made the right choice at the end though, because the girl he  chose was prettier and seemed like she would be more stable and faithful to  her man.",950745600,,530,4.2727272727272725
65574,2,0783235380,"this movie is a triumph of cliche: the plot is one you've seen so many times before that you can't believe anyone would flog it one more time(a road/buddie movie where the leads are of opposite temperament and gender,  and end up (surprise! ) entangled). the characters are similarly  stereotyped: the blonde-next-door sweetheart, the befuddled, bewildered,  stodgy male, the whore with the heart of gold who sets him free (to return  to his sweetheart as a wiser and deeper man). the dialogue,the  situations,the plot twists, are all so predictably stale that you're not  sure if you've wandered into some three-digit channel at 3am. the basic  fallacy behind this movie is the ""what do you do with a dead  horse?"" answer: ""pump him up with air and he'll float.""",948931200,3,763,4.90625

65597,4,0783235380,"""Forces of Nature"" tells the story of a man who tries to get to his wedding, but natural disasters occur.. Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock play the two main characters. Ben (Affleck) is engaged to a woman named Bridgette (Maura Tierney) and the day he lives for Savannah his plane experiences technical difficulties when a bird is caught in the engine causing it to crash. Along the way he meets Sarah (Bullock) a divorced woman who is on her way to see her son for his birthday. As they try to get Ben to his wedding, he begins to wonder if he should stay with Bridgette or let fate pair him up with Sarah. Affleck's acting is somewhat dismal, and Bullock and everyone else show him up at times.

This looks like it should have been made years ago. If this had been made about 10 years or more ago it would have ended up differently for sure.
Seems like modern times have made folks a little bit too stick in the mud and not up to make life an adventure as it should be.
Ben looked about 10 years younger than he does now. Sandra looked lovely as ever.  I was happy to see her in this movie but I think it could have ended better.

The other actors did fine, but the director did not give them much of an opportunity to give a supporting role. They were more like extras than supporting actors.

65616,5,0783235380,"I enjoyed the film excepted for it's twisted ending. One will assume when two people meet and the chemistry is flowing between them, this is it! Found the one, that moves Ben and her to higher levels of enjoyment like never before. They meet every hardship that nature threw at them, with laughter and bonding between them. Not anger or hard-feeling, or blaming each other got in their way. A real model of behavior to show ""How to bear Hardship"".
But Ben has to break the news to the so-called wife to be, falls flat on his face, and can not call off the marriage. Ben does not know his true self. The so-called ending summary of love, what it is, is exactly like ANY kind of relationship between family members, friends, and just trying to get along with people. Hardship breeds bonding and inner spiritual peace when it all over and they are together. And Ben last saying ""he will never forget her"" shows that ever lasting love. Ben grow up and do it with Trump.",1487894400,,965,4.4576271186440675

65626,2,0783235380,"Not about love at all.  The character of Sara needed a likeable actress like Sandra Bullock.  Sara was a hot, unholy mess and if it weren't for her good looks and Ben's character, Ben, being so moronic there'd  be no story.  Any normal man who hadn't grown up in a bomb shelter for 28 years would have met plenty of women like Sara long before now and not been impressed.  He'd have learned that fun and crazy can loose you money, sanity and get even the nicest guy locked-up in jail for almost choking a crazy b-out.  SPOILER ALERT****A twice married, once divorced chick whose kid at the age of 6 left HER to stay with the dad is telling.  I did like how the movie didn't hide the results of her disastrous behavior, but the way it interjected her exuberant nature to almost dismiss the horrible consequences of her actions was forced. What every undiagnosed mental problems Sara had they were nothing to be ignored.  The puppy dog love of Ben's character and his final choice to marry his fianc&eacute;e was peculiar. This wasn't even about soon to be married guy getting cold feet. If you have cold feet you run off with an unencumbered hippy chick in her early 20s or maybe even the stripper at your bachelor party (if you're feeling particularly nasty and your pockets are deep...strippers cost money...they don't love you..sorry to break the news.)  Sara had  MAJOR baggage and was old enough to be weighed down by it, shifting her into quick depression.  The writer(s) of this movie must have just gotten a divorce for the 3rd time, because he  hates love, marriage, and couples in general.  I don't know what the reviews were when it came out, but this movie is friggen depressing .  Ben and his so-called true love declaration  to his fianc&eacute;e is disingenuous... almost tacked on by the cynical writer just to please the initial testing audience.  I kind of hated this movie. You can feel a sneering creepiness, hatred,  and condescension for the viewing audience who actually came to see a romantic comedy from the writer(s) who delivered a cess pool of cynicism. I forgot to mention terrible blue lighting to add fantasy or magical or ( I don't know the @@#4) what to this movie.  If Ben was so enamored by Sara, what's to keep him from leaving his wife if she comes back into his life again when his marriage gets boring or stressful?  Nothing.  French Kiss is a better movie about a putz  getting cold fee and drops his long term fianc&eacute;e for a new hot chick--at least the fianc&eacute;e wakes up to the recognize the kind of idiot she almost married...and it's actually a funny movie.",1486512000,12,2611,4.620390455531453

Kudos to cinematographer and director. Watch it on a large screen to appreciate. I wish the director, Hughes, would do more film. The music score is wonderful and never overwhelms the story. The trajectory of the story is not your usual, predictable romantic comedy. These two drive each other crazy but can't deny the chemistry. You see them grow through the process of liking and disliking each other and sharing ridiculous and frustrating circumstances. The road trip is funny & clever but not slapstick. Bullock & Affleck own these characters and it doesn't end in the usual cliche manner. In the end, you realize that they're both going to be OK and that out of those detours in life that sometimes seem so difficult and unexplained, come the greatest gifts.",1417910400,,935,4.886792452830188

The movie begins with Ben (Ben Affleck) and Sarah (Sandra Bullock) inadvertently winding up as traveling companions from New York to Savannah after the plane they're on skids off the runway. Along the way they run into all sorts of difficulties. Among other things, they lose their cash, and Ben has to do a striptease in a gay bar to raise the money for them to reach their destination. (One would have thought that two upper middle class people would have credit cards with them. And certainly they could have gotten someone to wire them money, if necessary. But that wouldn't have been good for a cheap laugh.) Then there's the segment when they're on a tour bus filled with senior citizens, although there's no really good reason why they couldn't have found a more conventional mode of transportation. And, of course, they become emotionally (though not physically) involved, despite the fact that Ben is going to Savannah for his wedding to Bridget (Maura Tierney), which, by the time he and Sarah arrive in Savannah, we're sure he'll call off.

The movie is partially redeemed by the excellent acting on the part of Affleck and Bullock. And it is lighthearted and makes for easy watching, which helps, so long as you can get past the implausibilities along the way.",1381104000,,1360,4.787234042553192

65695,3,0783235380,"I'll spare the plot summary since there are already 72 reviews as of this writing so I'll write on the jist of the movie. Remove all the unrealistic scenes and this movie is basically a good conversation piece for you and your lover (wife, girlfriend, whatever) because it has to do with choices in relationships. Yes, the movie will reflect the basic sentiment prevalent nowadays regarding marriage which is basically that a successful one is a crap shot. But for those who have been run over by that train before we all know that relationships are work.

So jumping from partner to partner when things don't go the way you thought or want them too and you decide that you're ""not happy"" just doesn't really work for the average person. All you end up doing is carry your emotional baggage to the next relationship as Sarah's character slowly unfolded. Bottom line is that Ben went through a classic infatuation episode but in the end he did the nobler thing.

If you think that marriage is going to be a perpetual dose of dopamine that will leave you elated and euphoric every day of your life then think again. You have to both make it work and keep reminding each other of what brung you together in the first place before the kids, in-laws, and career.

As for the best acting, Sandra Bullock took the prize. I enjoyed seeing her free spirited bohemian side. She basically made Ben look good.

Ironically enough though, this movie was done before the Beniffer drama - remember that? He basically had the ""forces of nature"" in the form of paparazzi to help him walk away from that one. Not exactly the same ending as in this movie.",1186099200,3,1635,4.589041095890411

So in the commercial, the woman gives a little scream, sways back and forth, looks like she's going to be sick, and then instead pulls a rabbit out of the dryer.  Just like this movie because it's not that good until the end, and then JUST LIKE A MAGIC TRICK it all works out in the end.

65697,2,0783235380,"I disagree with virtually all of the reviewers about this film.  It was touted as a comedy and ""outrageously funny"".  Well it wasn't overly funny and it made a real effort to be funny but the ""funny"" scenes were so obviously forced and so obviously dumb that they just came across as stupid. Finding a rental car is not that difficult and that is the basis for this movie. I can't believe that anyone is as stupid as these people were supposed to be. Bullock is supposed to be a free spirit but she comes across as immature, undisciplined, and self absorbed.  This was a total waste of talent and Affleck and Bullock did their best but why people of their abilities agreed to appear in this film is a mystery.  I think what put me off of this film is it's totally unrealistic view of marriage.  Of course these are all Hollywood types where any marriage lasting longer than a month is viewed as unusual.  This film would have you believe that every marriage is at its core -- unhappy and that most people are divorced or adulterers. Men and women are unhappy with their partners and anyone who gets married should expect to be unhappy -- that is the message here, but it is also how most Hollywood types view marriage. Beyond that we have the usual Hollywood view that EVERYONE smokes Marijuana or takes drugs of some sort -- EVERYBODY DOES.  Well I don't think so and I thought this film was simply not funny and I don't see anything humorous about being arrested for drugs.  At no level was this film realistic and none of the actions were logical or believable (imagine holding an outside wedding even though hurricane flags are flying -- is anyone really that stupid?)  I gave this film 2 stars only because I watched it to the end -- why I have no idea because it wasn't worth it.",1166054400,2,1785,4.434250764525994
65698,3,0783235380,"Forces of Nature, was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock among others.

The movie sheds light on a man en route to Savannah, Georgia, for his wedding.  On the way he meets a woman who will have a tremendous effect on him, changing his whole approach to life.  Thus, the trip ends up being quite ""bumpy"" and with quite a few unexpected ""twists and turns...""

The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.

The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are just about average.

In addition, this movie does not seem to be Sandra Bullock's type of film.  Even though she is a wonderful actress, this role was not really for her and thus she is not that convincing in it.

Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.",1140134400,2,1083,4.365

They started out on the same flight but engine problems prevent their departure. They work together to try and find their way south. This provides for some amusement along the way as they get themselves from or mess to another but that is not the real story. The real story is how they fall for each other. This is particularly bad timing since the groom is expected to be a ""groom"" the next day.

The two seem mismatched and they are. Even so, each helps the other along. What gets in the way is faithfulness. It discloses nothing secret to say that the groom has second thoughts. Sandra Bullock has that effect on men. The real story is in how those second thoughts are handled.

This is by no means a great film but it does have its moments. Besides, Sandra is worth watching just for the scenery.",1129507200,4,944,4.419540229885057
65700,2,0783235380,"If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell.

Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning.

Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle?

The acting in this movie is ""meh"", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part.

The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you.

You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable.",1118361600,6,1450,4.43609022556391

The DVD isn't great - image isn't very high quality, and there's no commentary.  But the deleted scenes and featurette are a nice
feature.",1111363200,,409,4.513513513513513

Same sequence: airplane delays, then train occurrence, then bus, then jalopy-type car. But, since I totally enjoyed the Steve Martin movie, I also enjoyed 'Forces of Nature'. The writer even threw in some weather and fire, same as 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles'. Because of the similarities, I rated it four stars instead of five.

I thought the movie was cute and I like both Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck. I saw the movie as being typical of infatuation with a good-looking person to whom we've been thrown together with for a brief unlikely encounter and of indecisiveness prior to the marrage ceremony , but Ben was, indeed, committed to his fiance and to his future, which was a positive attribute on his behalf.

Unlike some other reviewers who stated commitment was void, I felt it was very much stated in this movie, in spite of other's around them having their own relationships fall apart.

Sarah's life was to be her son and her relationship with him - to build it up after some years of absence. The movie ended correctly. Everyone got what they wanted.

65703,1,0783235380,"Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole ""We're married and my husband's a doctor."" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and ""Dr. Holmes"" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?

What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.

Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?

Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us ""don't do it!"" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!

It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap.",1109721600,38,2584,4.361169102296451

Ben and Sarah are on a flight on its way to Savannah, but the plane has an accident. Ben is on his way to a wedding, and Sarah has to go to Savannah to claim $25 grand by selling a donut shops she owns. They hitch a ride in a rental car with a guy named Vic who smokes pot, and they are later caught and held, eventually released. Other events occur, such as them hitcing a ride with a real estate bus, pretending to be married so they can find their way down to Savannah. She lies about them being married, and him being a doctor. Of course they spar heads a few times, he is uneasy with her carefree attitude and she wants him to live a little more. Their lies catch up with them and put them in compromising positions, prompting Ben to strip in a gay bar for money to buy a car, so they can leave this town before they are arrested for fraud and not paying their motel bill. There's lots going on, and fate doesn't seem to be on their side. Ben takes this to mean he shouldn't get married, everyone gives him bad advice on marriage, and he is starting to doubt his intentions as well. We later find out Sarah is married and has a child from a previous marriage, who she had not seen in 2 years. She wants to give him the money she is after, but we find out her child was taken away from her, which is basically a sore spot for her. In the end, when Ben thinks he is going to dump his bride, he makes it and decides to marry her in Hawaii...and Sarah is reunited with her son and seems to be on the road to reconciliation with him.

Maura Tierney does an excellent job with her role and actually saves this film from being just another clich statement on boy-meets-other-girl. Your heat will just go out to Tierney. Sandra Bullock also has more at stake if she just falls for Affleck. The script tries to put you in the mind of Affleck and the indecisiveness he is experiencing. This is more than just a head-over-heels love story on a whim. It makes the viewer experience the emotional turmoil that the main characters are going through.

65711,3,0783235380,"In the realm of romantic comedy, Forces of Nature might be described as earnest. Its makers intended to make something original, and while they did not succeed, it was not from lack of trying. The laughs and, to a degree, the romance are here, but the movie never reaches the heights it aims for.
Ben and Bridget [Ben Affleck and Maury Tierney] are to be wed in a few days at her parents' home in Savannah. He is to fly from New York City for the event. Ben writes blurbs for book jackets for a living. He's a somewhat stuffy fellow who never lets himself go. On the airplane, he meets Sarah [Sandra Bullock], a whacky free spirits with a heart of gold - the kind who exists only in movies. [You know this character. It's the one that makes a complete mess of life, yet always ends up somehow nobler than everyone else.] She tries to strikes up a merry conversation with the reticent Ben. Her attempts are interrupted when a seagull gets sucked into one of the plane's engines. This causes the craft to veer off the runway while attempting take off. Unscathed, the two find themselves hitching a ride with a mad man. Thus begins their often hilarious road trip together. Ben must make it to the wedding on time, and Sarah must get to Savannah for her own reasons.
Forces of Nature is Bullock's third foray into playing a romantic lead, and it is her best attempt. It is Affleck's first try. There is a certain amount of chemistry between the two leads, but I am convinced that Bullock's forte will eventual prove to be in other areas. This is not necessarily a negative criticism, for the same can be said of Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver and Meryl Streep. As for Affleck, he still exhibits an immaturity which does not lend itself well to this kind of role.
Most of the humor is not provided by the two stars. It comes in the form of the characters they run into, whose observations about relationships and marriage are sharp and witty. Interest is also provided by a series of calamities, many of them natural, which conspire to delay the couple from reaching their destination.
The film's major flaw, unfortunately, is its ending. Given the premise that the forces of nature will conspire to keep you from going down the wrong path in life, the conclusion seems exceptionally unnatural.",1016755200,2,2289,4.571776155717761

It is true that this movie did contain some lines of good humor, and some traits and sequences intended to make the easily laughable laugh, and I can see why people would write ""this movie is horrible"" in their review, simply based on this humor.

65713,3,0783235380,"Yet again the talents of the wonderful Sandra Bullock are wasted in an average movie. Ben Affleck plays Ben who is on his way to his wedding but gets stuck with the kooky Sarah (Bullock) when their plane crashes. Then a manic road journey takes place as together they attempt to reach their destination. Except the journey never is that manic and the comedy is constrained somewhat by some drama elements. To give the film credit it is beautifully shot, almost to the point of distraction. Sandra is lost in dodgy make up as the wacky Sarah who serves as a temptation to uptight Ben. The fact that they inspire each other is predicatable, but the ending is not. That this film is billed as a romantic comedy is not quite accurate. It is not funny enough, there is the dramatic edge to the story that is almost more effective and the romance is not supplied in the usual way. This is the stumbling block, if the film makers had chosen which route they wanted to take this could have been an outstanding film. What we are left with instead is an enjoyable but unremarkable way to waste 90 minutes.",990316800,,1095,4.48

Only the only sad part was that it has a bit of a sad ending, since Sandra is my favorite...  The movie goes like this: It's only two days before Ben's (Ben Affleck) wedding when his plane ""crashes"". He ""rescues"" Sarah (Sandra Bullock), and decides not to fly to his wedding in Savannah. He ends up with Sarah in a car of a strange guy, because there was no other transportation possible, and ends up in jail for a night. After that everything is going to be a disaster. The only positive thing is that Sarah keeps him company, and makes the journey more enjoyable.

65716,2,0783235380,"There's nothing really more irritating than sitting down to a movie that you think is going to be good and ends up falling flat on its face. ""Forces of Nature,"" while trying to be funny and cheerful, succeeds only in achieving this goal, and, I must say, very admirably. Promoted as a bright and sassy comedy about a guy trying desperately to get to his wedding, it ends up being more, so much more, in fact, that it bogs the film down in a blithering mess of subplot and washed up one-liners which carry on for too long.
The husband in question is Ben Holmes, who hates bachelor parties and can't wait to get hitched with his soulmate sweetheart. Of course, they both live in New York, and since the story needs a great deal of distance to separate our two love birds for a long period of time, the wedding is going to take place in Savannah, where her parents are planning a very festive celebration. Ben's parents want to marry him off for some reason not discussed in the plot. She flies down before him (why not together?), and he soon boards his own plane which has an accident on the runway, leaving him and his seating partner Sarah stranded. Sarah is a bit wild and evasive, without a care in the world it seems, though her admissions will later prove otherwise. Thus begins the wild race down to Savannah, involving natural and human disasters which stand in his way, not to mention his undeniable attraction to the illustrious Sarah.
The story seems like it has a lot going for it. So why does it fail in so many places during the movie? Well, there's a lot of things wrong with it: the contrivance of the plot, the bad execution of most of the key scenes, the let-down ending, and most of all, the character of Ben.
Throughout the entire movie, our two little nomads run into one problem after another, from things like stalled planes to switched train cars, from stormy weather to geriatrics on a travel bus who believe the lie about Ben being a doctor, Ben and Sarah run into just about anything you can possibly think of. While this may sound amusing, it gets to the point where you keep wishing he'd do one of two things: call his parents and get their credit card number to purchase a ticket to Savannah, or screw Sarah like he knows he wants to, call his fiancee and break the wedding off, and run away into the sunset and never be seen again.
The way some of the scenes in this film were carried out, as well as their content, are too contrived and unbelievable to make the movie work. one of these scenes that especially stands out is the trip they take to K-Mart to get out of a rainstorm. Here, they are seen romping through the store, using walkie-talkies to communicate while shopping, sitting in beach lounge chairs having drinks and talking like they own the chain of stores. I'm not sure how they usually operate things at K-Mart, but in my town, they'd be kicked out by management. The ending is the biggest contrivance, and since I cannot give it away, let's just say that there's no way you can have a wedding like that.
The characters of the film turn out to be a major disappointment, especially when they are given the opportunity to shine. Ben, portrayed by Ben Affleck, is portrayed as nothing more than a mushy, whining idiot who you wish would trip and break his face at least ten times throughout the movie. While his inner struggle is supposed to provide a dramatic factor for the movie, it does nothing more than make him and the story more annoying and unbearable. Sandra Bullock, while charming and radiant, proves that her character is a big fat waste of talent. Her free-spiritedness and wit grow even more tired than Affleck's whining, though she does have her monents of hilarity. The saddest waste of actress is Maura Tierney, who plays Ben's fiancee. During her stay in Savannah, awaiting the arrival of Ben, all she can do is pout about his inability to reach her sooner, get drunk with friends, be seduced without success by an old high school male friend, and listen to her parents gripe and complain about her fiancee's tardiness.
One an even worse note, I must comment on the decision to try and have a parental storyline going on in the midst of everything else (as if there weren't enough to keep up with already). Tierney's parents turn out to be separated, while Affleck's are happily married. They keep popping up just when you think they've been obliterated by the scriptwriter who was deciding to give us a blessing.
My summation: too much plot going on, hardly a shred of believability, even if you suspend disbelief, and less-than-amusing characters, all combined into one large mess that makes ""Forces of Nature"" a very confused and sloppy attempt at a romantic comedy. To thou who wouldst see this movie, I charge thee beware endless subplots and annoyances that make your own life's discord seem like posies in a breezy field.",980294400,5,4891,4.571753986332574
65717,5,0783235380,"That's the point of this movie--2 people who shouldn't be together, but who teach each other something along the way while also learning a lot about themselves.
Why is it that every time Sandra Bullock goes beyond the cutesy ""While You Were Sleeping"" format (which I admit to loving), she cops it? She's fantastic as the likeable Sarah who doesn't see just how likeable she is, and learns to accept herself during the journey. Ben Affleck is a stiff? He's *supposed* to be, and that adds value to the film, especially his embarrassment at having to peel 'Sarah' off the floor of a K-Mart they're sheltering in. And then there's the striptease in the gay bar--gorgeous.
Obviously I was looking at it from a different angle, because I thought Bullock & Affleck had a lot of chemistry going on and played off each other nicely. Combine that with a great support cast, especially Steve Zahn as Affleck's best friend, and Moira Tierney as his fiance, and you've got a great, fun flick. It deserves 5 stars for recognizing that there will always be temptation--how we chose to deal with it is the ultimate test of character.",977097600,34,1118,4.709183673469388

When you watch it the second time look for  these forces and note the wonderful camera angles and cinematography during  the weather scenes.  Also note that weather is not the only force out  there.  The scenes weren't dark it was a filter.  The director wanted you  to see it through this sorta blue filter and I don't think it would have  worked as well without it.

65725,3,0783235380,"In ""Forces of Nature,"" Ben Affleck stars as Ben, a repressed,  buttoned-up stuffed shirt writer who, through a series of natural and  manmade mishaps, ends up spending the several days before his impending  marriage in the company of a freespirited, totally spontaneous and  liberated young woman named Sarah, played by Sandra Bullock.
For the  vast majority of the film's running time, the screenplay follows the  conventions of the opposites-attract scenario almost slavishly. The script  even provides Ben's fiancee with an overly-convenient replacement in the  form of a now-hunky childhood friend she has not seen in years who  rekindles sparks with her on the eve of the wedding.
Thus, with the  troublesome fiance conveniently out of the way, the stage is set for the  predictable true love romantic finale. But, damn, if the writers don't pull  the rug out from under us and shatter the time-honored cliche. This is  particularly surprising because, up to now, the film has exhibited no trace  of iconoclasm in either its plot or character development. In fact, the  screenplay is less a full-fledged narrative than a series of photographic  montage sequences strung lazily together as Ben and Sarah engage in one  cutesy situation and encounter after another. Thus, the unconventionality  of the resolution comes as an even more stunning surprise than it otherwise  might.
Affleck and Bullock are very appealing as two young people who  complement each other's strengths and weaknesses and who learn to offer one  another valuable life lessons. ""Forces of Nature"" emerges as one  of those rare films that is, perhaps, actually better in retrospect than in  the watching.",964483200,27,1679,5.2293233082706765

65727,4,0783235380,"""Forces of Nature"", interesting chemistry between two talented actors with a slightly above average love story.
I was first recommended the movie by a friend.  I guess many of us guys who plan to get married  should watch this movie because it does hit straight for your heart.
The  movie itself is not the greatest love story but it's nevertheless pretty  good.  I wondered before the movie on how the chemistry between Affleck and  Bullock would be and in my opinion the two did pretty well for their  characters. &#63728;&#63728; The movie showed a lot of colors but  many times it's dark.  I wonder why the director chose this and thus I wish  they added a director's commentary with this DVD.
According to the  booklet, this movie was shot before Affleck's popularity which was  interesting.  The special effects for the movie are well done and sound  good in your 5.1 digital surround system.  But where the movie is a little  above average and the sound and video well done (I noticed just a little  artifacts but nothing severe).
A letdown for the DVD was in the extras  department.  Hardly any.  But I have seen worse and I'm just glad they  included the deleted scenes, trailers and featurette.
The alternative  ending was quite interesting and I'm glad they left it out.  It would of  ruined the movie I think.
All in all, it's your average love story on DVD  but I give it a slightly above average rating for the twist and the ending.
For those who have friends who are thinking about marriage and thinks  about it continuously like I have, let your friend borrow the DVD or tell  him to buy it.  Because this movie in a way somewhat makes us evaluate our  own relationships.",959385600,2,1687,4.60472972972973
65728,4,0783235380,"_Forces of Nature_ is an exploration into the nature of happiness.  It posits the somewhat controversial notion that personal truth can be discovered through infidelity, and that life's answers are to be found in  random acts of nature.  Some may well find these suppositions difficult to  swallow, and may discover nothing redeeming in the ultimate conclusions of  the piece.
I, however, found the film charming and plausible.  I very  much like the weather metaphors, and the fact that, for the brief time the  movie charts,  the characters seem to have no power over what's happening  to them.  It is that surrender to the uncontrollable which, in satisfying  irony, ultimately brings stability and genuine change to the characters'  lives.  The director amplifies the meaning of this metaphor through the  clever use of special effects in a way usually reserved to science fiction  films.  It's a very interesting technique to find in a romantic comedy.  Unfortunately, to speak specifically about it would be to give away the  ending,  Suffice it to say that it's a great example of how special effects  can be used to bring emotional impact to a film, not just to create worlds.
If there is a fault to the film, it is that the chemistry between  Affleck and Bullock works so very well, that it is emotionally difficult to  understand why Affleck would find his bride-to-be, played by Maura Tierney,  worthy of marriage. It is as if the filmmakers would have us simply believe  that if Tierney and Affleck got to the point of a wedding, the relationship  must necessarily be a strong one.  Of course, we can accept that, but  somehow the strength of that relationship is never quite *shown*.  Without  a demonstration of the Tierney's attractive qualities, some of the film's  conclusions don't make emotional sense to us-even if they're perfectly  sensible.
Still, the film is a great date movie, and may well have  special meaning to couples who met in random ways.  Its well-crafted enough  that it could be on some people's `favorite romance' list, and I doubt many  would find it unenjoyable.  It's definitely one of the top 20 romantic  comedies I've seen.
