8594597,3,B00DMUFWVM,"I only purchased this for one movie in particular and that was Restoration. Although, I could've purchased that buy itself I decided that having the collection would be nice. I won't say it was a bad decision because some of the movies are pretty good, such as Jane Ayre starring George C. Scott. I would recommend this just don't expect all the movies to be top notch. But you may be pleasantly surprised. :-)",1397606400,4,410,4.554054054054054
