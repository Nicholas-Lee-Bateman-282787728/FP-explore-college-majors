8553287,5,B008RZF5KA,This is a nice introductory course to shadow work...Diane Hamilton is a great presenter who engages the listener with effective communicative techniques.,1351036800,,153,6.0
8553288,5,B008RZF5KA,"As someone who has spent zero time in analysis,and with definite reservations about the entire process, I found Dianne to be incredibly engaging,and enjoyed the program immensely. Even  with no knowledge of Jungian psychology, I benefited greatly and learned how to use ""shadow work"" as a way of improving and understanding myself. The program was not only useful but entertaining, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in better understanding oneself.",1348358400,2,467,5.3108108108108105
8553289,5,B008RZF5KA,"Diane is a pleasure to watch. She works in a participatory way, engaging the audience rather than merely lecturing. By this hands-on method, she shows how ""shadow work"" can be done on one's own or with a partner, but without the need to engage an analyst and spend thousands of dollars in analysis. It's useful, informative, and entertaining all at the same time. If you enjoy Jungian psychology and would like to apply it in your life in a concrete way, the video is for you.",1348272000,2,476,4.546511627906977
