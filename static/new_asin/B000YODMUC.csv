8325950,5,B000YODMUC,"I waited almost a year for this film. It was better than I expected. Sweet shots from Israel, Canada and Merlins house. This action packed film starts out with Andreu Lacondeguy. His first trick is a huge double backflip. It is one of three double backflips to pedals ever landed on a mountain bike. Next is solid work from Wayne Goss. A sweet segment from the Kona Clump team in the middle, and awesome music from then on. It is the only mountain bike film you need.",1194739200,,467,4.379310344827586
