7878593,5,6304879490,"One needs an acquired taste to enjoy French cinema. By the way I have noticed that all good comedies in the USA are remakes of old original French comedies. But always the originals are far better. Cannot believe to my eyes while reading these reviews here, I guess these people need Disney movies with elementary appeal.",1509321600,,321,4.75
7878594,3,6304879490,"The DVD pictured on Amazon.com is a French language only NTSC region 1 DVD from the studio (distributor) Axia Films produced for sale in Canada, targeting the French Canadian population in Quebec -- this is the product I received when I ordered this DVD from Amazon.com, which is accurately described on the DVD back cover pictured that can be enlarged when it is viewed on Amazon.com. The Amazon.com Product Description lists an English language NTSC DVD from a studio named ""Imports"", which may or may not exist.

The 90 minute French film ""Un Indien dans la Ville"" was released theatrically in the USA March 22, 1996, by Disney under their Touchstone Pictures label with the title ""Little Indian, Big City"" and with its soundtrack dubbed into English in what reviewer Leonard Maltin described as ""terrible American dubbing"" -- it grossed only $1M theatrically in the USA. (This was also released on VHS videocassette in 1997.) Meanwhile, from May to August, 1996,  Disney reshot the screenplay, keeping the same Venezuelan locations but changing the principal location from Paris to New York City and released this remake in the USA March 7, 1997, under the title ""Jungle 2 Jungle"" which grossed $59.9M theatrically making it the 31st largest grossing film in the USA in 1997.

The popularity of ""Un Indien dans la Ville"" in France has been compared to the popularity of ""Home Alone"" (1990) in the USA ($281.5M theatric US gross). The cooler reception of ""Jungle 2 Jungle"" in the USA might be attributable in part to age: Sam Huntington playing Mimi-Siku was 14 years old when ""Jungle 2 Jungle"" was shot whereas Ludwig Briand playing Mimi-Siku was 12 when ""Un Indien dans la Ville"" was shot. Plus, Briand has large brown eyes that reminds one of the look of Elijah Wood when he was that age. (Of course, Macauly Culkin was only 9 when ""Home Alone"" was shot.)",1492732800,,1861,4.845911949685535

7878597,5,6304879490,"This one was written and produced BEFORE jungle to jungle. The characters are different, of course, but JtoJ was stolen from this, almost word for word! Instead of occurring in NY, this happens in Paris. The kid in this one is a little younger than Sam Huntington, but he seems to have more fun. Worth it if you can find it at the right price.",1366588800,2,343,4.292307692307692

7878600,1,6304879490,"This movie is poor in every dimension.  The most egregious of its inadequacies is the director's inability to tell such a simple story.  Any scene of impending interest is killed; leaving the feeling that the director is trying to create a movie out of loosely related short vignettes, thus deliberately downplaying anything that could be mistaken for a plot.  The only reason I finished this movie was because I could not believe how bad it was.  I have turned off many a ""better"" movie.  This could be ranked as one of the ten worst directed movies in history.  Unfortunately, you can not rank something as zero stars on Amazon.",1192838400,,630,4.73394495412844
7878601,3,6304879490,"This film is a predecessor to Jungle to Jungle with Tim Allen and Sam Huntington.  Since I didn't have the orinal sleeve with all the details I can only guess that it is in French and dubbed English.  The mouth moveing and then words a split second later gave it away.  This film starts in the jungle then moves to Paris then back to the jungle.  A boy grows up in the jungle with his mom.  Dad is a broker and wants to remarry but has to get the divorce signed by his wife.. you got it, in the jungle ""half way around the world.""  The best actor of the whole thing is Ludwig Briand an affable little guy that is better in this film, although somewhat younger, than Sam Huntington in Jungle to Jungle.  He's really enjoying himself I think.
  While half naked he: climbs the Eiffle Tower, Terrorizes his dads girl friend with his pet Tarantula; pins a pigeon to the wall of his dad's neighbor; and wins the heart of a girl; all while smiling and acting like it is no big deal.
  I liked the story line but the adult actors were there for support, or not.  Ludwig Briand is superb and does his job well.
Get both films and compare.  Little Indian Big City will win hands down, although Jungle To Jungle was better acted and directed Ludwig I think had a better time making the film and it comes accross quite nicely in the finished product.
  Adults in the film 1 star, kids 5 stars.",1049500800,7,1382,4.241379310344827
