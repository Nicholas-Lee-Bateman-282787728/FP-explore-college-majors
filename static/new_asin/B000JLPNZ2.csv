8151636,5,B000JLPNZ2,"A DVD and CD of botch's final show for 15 bucks? If you're a botch fan, do yourself a favor and buy this for your collection.  It's definitely worth the money.  The show was recorded with handheld video cameras and then edited together so you get multiple angles. Sound quality is great too.",1509753600,,291,4.471698113207547

8151639,4,B000JLPNZ2,One of the best live DVDs I have ever watched. The audio quality is acceptable and the commentary feature where the set is played with the members of the band reminiscing is probably better than the set itself!,1282867200,,210,4.552631578947368
8151640,5,B000JLPNZ2,"im one of the few people who happend to get into botch too late, and since i never got the chance to see them live this is as close as i get. its really an incredible performance to watch. the packaging for the dvd is really awesome aswell. it really makes you miss this band. this is definitly a must for anyone who is a fan of Botch and is thinking about buying this. also listen to the band the guitar player is now in, they're called MINUS THE BEAR. they're also a really incredible rock band.",1239062400,,497,4.134020618556701

8151642,5,B000JLPNZ2,"So I always knew that these guys are awesome there's no doubt about it but when I got this DVD it made me realize even more how crazily insanely awesome they are! It's a great show to watch not only becuase they know how to rock but also becuase it was their very last show and you can tell that they are putting everything into it, blood sweat and tears, literally they get a bit choked up towards the end of the show. On the lighter side watch this with the commentary on, it freakin funny! Anyways they play awesome live on this, it also comes with a cd with all the same tracks that they play on the DVD.",1170720000,3,608,4.075
8151643,4,B000JLPNZ2,"Great show. Very energetic, occasionally sloppy, though you can excuse them, since it's their last show. They play all the classic Botch songs. The commentary on the show is very funny as well. In addition, there is another show from a couple years before that also sounds great. Comes with a CD. If you like Botch, spend the money.",1166486400,5,332,4.6440677966101696
