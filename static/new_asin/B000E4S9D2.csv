Watch this with your spouse or by yourself don't watch it with your parents or your kids. Turn off the cell phones and sit down and watch it then talk about. You will find that it will answer many of your questions that you have and many that you were afraid to ask because they might be too embarrassing. I bought this movie and loved it.",1406505600,,515,4.108910891089109
