4861111,5,B005RT5ON2,"This movie gives a much better and more truthful telling of St. John XXIII's life; more so than the Ignatius Press' version with Ed Asner; their version made him out to be something he was not; a man of tolerance and accommodating; this version with Bob Hoskins showed his heart and soul to us and made us cry; something that was lacking in the Ignatius Press; everything about this movie Good Pope John XXIII was so much more upper class than Ignatius Press.

I highly recommend this movie rather than the Ignatius press version; and make it known that this version is the one to sell than the other one.",1401321600,2,605,4.5
4861112,5,B005RT5ON2,"I just purchased this movie and loved it!  It is a wonderful movie that shows how Pope John XXIII with great Faith in GOD would see that nothing was impossible.  A man full of peace, happiness, joy, hope and all the beautiful gifts that God has for us he had them and shared them with all those around him. He served the Lord with love. Total obedience, and forgave those that hurt him.  He lived with suffering when cancer was diagnosed, but still fought to the end, and served the God just like we all should do.

 I have watched it 2 times already as it is a very inspirational movie that I wish humans would take it to their hearts to heal internally and do of their lives what God wants us to do and be.  We are his children and many have forgotten to thank HIM for all he has given us. Many people now a days are hypocrites saying they love God, but yet many times the bad actions of a good human can show the pain a heart can carry when for the love of money, power,  greed, and ego is what tends to destroy internally and worse others that sometimes tend to be your own family.  Religious and non religious  people should do their daily check up on their conscience in the morning, afternoon, and all day so they can all be disciples of God, and the non religious to see how they can also look inside and see what they need to work on to be better.  If mother and father would give real love to their children specially when in high school they would know love vs material goods and would value family more than material goods.  It is easy for parents to give them all that money can buy, but where is LOVE? True love.  many parents want to be blind when their teenagers when going  to high school letting them raise themselves most of the times as parents are to busy making money to compete with others, buy more and stay on top of the food chain, but if they would focus on raising good children these future generations would be better. Many right now have abandoned our Lord. Many only care to just get out of their houses for they see their mothers are control freaks vs mentors, friends and showing no tenderness when they have had rough times... their escape is ""can't wait to get out to college"" and party as they have been under a regimen through those teenage years.  Parents do not know how to build trust among their teenagers anymore, because many times they do not even take the time to get to know them once they reach their teens, but only buy them fancy cars, ipads,etc. Parent love being blind during this phase to avoid headaches and ignoring if they sleep around, do drugs and alcohol. The excuse parents have in their brain is ""Well that is all expected from when teenagers go off to College"" ""teenagers are rebels"", but why should we allow them to do destroy themselves? Why not guide them better from day one. This is a lack of parenting.  We must as parents take responsibility. It is our job to guide them since they are young. We must feed them the right things for them to be great children of God even to College and further.  It is a hard job, but very rewarding when you see them doing good and staying out of bad habits that only cause them to destroy their good hearts. If we all as parents take this movies to push us to be better people teenager would have more values and morals something that this country is bringing down.  Please be involved in the life of your teenagers and guide them vs controlling them or spoiling them.  Grow disciples not destruction. Are all focusing their lives in power. Greed. Many want to blame the church leaders on their reasoning of why they leave the church, but that is an excuse.  We go to church to go see God our creator and thank HIM  not judge the priest or their figures. Who are we to judge. Only God will judge us when the right time comes. So leave it to HIM and forgive those that have harm others. We are here to go visit the Lord to his house. Live our lives with HIM.  I am divorced and catholic and  have do not listened to the rules of the church for those that are divorced, because I go see the real Father.  He is the one that needs me. I do not judge those that represent God in our church.  No rule will stop me from loving HIM.  Every Sunday I go be with HIM as he loves me, and that is all it matters.  All I can say is purify your hearts specially when watching this great movies, and work to healing internally so you can forgive, and love back again all those that have attacked you this is the only way you will live your life in peace, happiness, joy, harmony and love. Cherish these beautiful gifts that only God can give us  so you can love your life and GOD to its fullest.

Keep making this kind of great movie please!",1400630400,3,4729,4.241917502787068
4861113,5,B005RT5ON2,"Bob Hoskins stars as Pope John XXIII in this 3-hour Italian miniseries on the life of ""The Good Pope"" with a distinctive Ennio Morricone score reminiscent of his old Spaghetti Western themes. Finally released to DVD in Region 1, this film covers much of the same ground as ""John XXIII"" (2008) with Ed Asner, sometimes feeling like a scene-by-scene remake. But ""The Good Pope"" is in many ways superior.

Firstly, this DVD comes only in English, and the dubbing of Italian voices is far superior to that of the Ed Asner film. Lip movements and voices match the words and faces here, for the most part, with some of the actors even seeming to be speaking in their own voices with strong Italian accents. In any event, ""The Good Pope"" appears to have been filmed in English and the lip movements generally match, despite the fact that Hoskins is the only native English speaker in a major role.

By contrast, the Ed Asner film includes two equally disappointing soundtrack options: You can choose either English with terribly cartoonish dubbing of all the actors other than Asner, or Italian where everybody's lips match but Asner is dubbed by an Italian. Despite Asner's very warm and spot-on imitation of John XXIII, there's just no good way to watch that DVD.

Secondly, the framing method for the flashbacks works better here than the Asner film. While ""John XXIII"" focuses on the papal conclave and keeps flashing back to vignettes in the pope's earlier life, ""The Good Pope"" looks back through the eyes of a cardinal and minimizes back-and-forth cutting. All of the same milestones in Angelo Roncalli's life are covered in both films, and Asner's film gives a stronger sense of the ecclesiastical politics that elected him as pope, but there's considerably less cheese in this Hoskins film.

Thirdly, Hoskins is superior in many ways to Asner in the role of John XXIII, bringing more gravitas and depth to his performance. As a Catholic, Hoskins seems to have a deeper grasp on the character's inner motivations than the Jewish Asner, who is stronger at imitating the late pope's waddling walk and hand gestures. When Hoskins finally appears on screen in the first half of the film, replacing lesser known Italian actors who had played the younger Roncalli, there is a clear elevation in the quality of this film. As he had done in his portrayal of the dictator Noriega in ""God's Favorite,"" Hoskins simply becomes his role.

Unlike the ""John XXIII"" DVD with Ed Asner, which features a documentary, there are no special features on this disc, but merely an option to play the entire film at once or both parts separately. The two halves are not edited into one seamless film, but include end credits at the end of part one and then a repetition of the main titles at the start of part two. The Ignatius Press DVD of the Ed Asner film is also broken into two parts with intervening credits, with both films focusing on pre-papacy Roncalli in part one and on his papacy in part two.

This film is not always coherent or involving, but it includes far less fictionalizing than the Ed Asner film, being produced by Mediatrade rather than RAI. The second half, centering on Roncalli's papacy, is stronger than the first half on his childhood and early priestly career. It's not in the same league as the Emmy-nominated CBS Miniseries ""Pope John Paul II"" with Jon Voight, the gold standard of papal biography films, but there are some worthwhile things here. Despite the requisite hokey and cutesy vignettes that litter these papal hagiography films, the movie finds some focus and energy when it reaches John XXIII's calling of the Second Vatican Council and work on behalf of world peace.",1399680000,23,3685,4.804416403785489

He started to be ill with stomach problems in 1956.  Knowing that he wasn;t especially well, he should never have accepted election as Pope.",1431907200,,480,4.546511627906977

4861128,1,B005RT5ON2,"You like the movie. The acting is good. The film flows well. All is well. Or is it?
How relevant is the truth? If you take an untruth, throw in some events that did transpire, would that make it truthful or factual? By no means. Half truths are far worse that outright lies. After all that is the ploy that Satan uses to deceive, for the boundary between truth and falsehood becomes obscure. And this is exactly what this film has done.

To begin let us take the tile: The Good Pope John XXIII (Truth); the MOST REVOLUTIONARY pope of all time (Fiction). He touched the hearts of millions (Truth) and changed history (Fiction).
First and foremost,the Church nor her Popes have been Revolutionary. The Church and the Popes have always been COUNTER-revolutionary. Its role is to educate and to interpret its teaching when society is either at peace (which has been rare due to our fallen nature) or in the throes of revolution and turmoil. That is what St. John XXIII did with the Second Vatican Council, which,in the revolutionary spirit of the 60's was necessary.

Regarding the film; this movie is wonderful in portraying his childhood years. That is actually the only part that I actually liked along with other aspects that actually involve some fact. But for most part it portrays him as a  flaming liberal,a modernist disillusioned with the church and wanting to usurp it. This is the gist of the producers, writers and directors. Sorry to pop their balloon, but Roncalli was actually a staunch conservative. Read his life. Truth is stranger than fiction.

The other things that are disturbing which consists of half truths and outright lies:
- Roncalli, in his seminary years  seems to be a covert sympathizer of the Modernist heresy.
- A friend of Roncalli's (a modernist heretic) accuses the church of wanting to keep it in the dark ages and voices his support for Emmanuel Kant. Roncalli seems to support this man and it explicitly shows that Roncalli agrees with him.
- Conservatives are continuously portrayed as the villains, resistant to modernism (though it was denounced by Pope St. Pius X another 'son of the soil' who like St. John XXIII was born to poor peasants, but then that never is mentioned, is it?). The communists and liberals are portrayed as so oppressed and so heroic.
- Roncalli is shown marching the streets of Bergamo with Communists demanding justice. Very cliched portrayal of a march with red banners and cards.

One thing should be made EXTREMELY CLEAR : THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT DEMANDING JUSTICE,FAIR PLAY AND DIGNITY FOR EVERYONE. IT IS IN THE SOCIAL TEACHINGS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE CATECHISM! LOOK IT UP YOURSELVES, BE IT THE BALTIMORE OR THE MORE MODERN VERSION.
HOWEVER IT NEVER COLLABORATES WITH MOVEMENTS OR SOCIETIES OR AGENDAS THAT STAND IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH OR THE KINGSHIP OF CHRIST!
Father Roncalli did support trade unions, but CATHOLIC trade unions, which this film fails deliberately to point out.

But the ultimate cherry on this dung cake of a film is that they show that the Tridentine Latin Mass is liked by the Nazis. So everyone who like the Tridentine mass, in the eyes of the makers of this movie is a....well what do you know!....a NAZI. (Despite the fact that the creative team has used very little research in making this film,one would think they would have at least tried to find out who released the 1962 missal....?).

All of the above is only in the first part of the movie, within the first hour or so. Watching the second part, therefore for me, would've been a colossal waste of time.

To conclude this movie has a biased political agenda that desires to hijack the memory of this Saint and its release was to coincide with his canonization to make THEIR point or intepret his life as THEY SEE IT.

Catholic viewers, I seriously do NOT recommend this film. It will not feed your soul, nor impart any knowledge. It might in fact hurt it and leave you confused. I suggest reading a book on his life such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journal-of-a-Soul-The-Autobiography-of-Pope-John-XXIII/dp/0385497547/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journal of a Soul: The Autobiography of Pope John XXIII</a>which is his autobiography.
A reviewer sated that this film is better than Ed Asner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-XXIII/dp/B001EPKKV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John XXIII</a>artistically. It may be so. However it is not filled with half truths or outright lies like this one.

This movie in my view point is so disgustingly phoney that it is the first (and I hope, only) movie that I rate 1 star.

A political yarn that is a waste of time and money.",1409011200,10,4766,5.041931385006353
4861129,4,B005RT5ON2,"A good chronicle of the life of Pope John XXXIII, taking the viewer from his childhood to his death in 1963.

If you would like to know something about pope John XXIII, I would instead recommend John XXIII- The Pope of Peace with Edward Asner. Not only Asner who shows the pope in triumph, in charge, and occasionally in despair, but also the younger incarnations of John XXIII are wonderful actors, and so are those surrounding him. The only concession to saintliness in that movie is the final scene in which John and Cardinal Ottaviani reconcile. In fact Ottaviani remained irreconcilable up to his own death.
