8593807,3,B000066C7Q,"For the very very basic stuff the video covers it does a good job. But I expected more on a whole DVD. It has just about 30 minutes of material just showing the absolute basics. As an example, there is very limited information on buzzing on this DVD. I found much more information on playing the trumpet on the Internet using search engines while I was waiting for the DVD to arrive. The DVD also has a few PDF files with basic music theory/sheet music reading but it is too basic and without any context to help you understand it and use it.",1113696000,6,542,4.271844660194175
