7815414,4,6301801202,"Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror, 1942 film

The Voice of Terror transmits from Germany to spread fear to the people of England by telling them of defeats and accidents. What can be done against this? The Inner Council will call Sherlock Holmes, but some protest. There is a prediction of a train accident. It occurs! Do what you can says one man. Holmes will act. Captain Shaw asks that the Inner Council be kept informed. Back home Watson cleans his revolver. Holmes listens to a broadcast while using an oscilloscope. What does he observe? A man enters and collapses after saying Christopher. Holmes and Watson visit the Limehouse district. A Nazi agent points a gun at them!

But waterfront boys attack him, and he manages a surprise escape! Back home Kitty visits Meade and finds shelter from the police. Holmes deduced a leak from the Inner Council. Who can it be? Kitty tells something will happen at Seven Oaks that night. An enemy plane prepares to land but Sir Evan shoots at it. Meade escapes and returns to his home. The Voice of Terror predicts an air invasion in the north tomorrow. But Holmes observed a change in this speech. Holmes leads soldiers to a site in the south and captures a gang of Nazis. The traitor is unmasked. The German attack was defeated. But Meade grabs a gun and shoots Kitty! Its his last act. Holmes says a cold and bitter east wind is coming but a better stronger land will stay in the sunshine when the storm is over. [Does this ending remind you of E. Phillip Oppenheims story The Great Impersonation rather than His Last Bow?]

This was the first Sherlock Holmes story to be set in modern time, a change from previous movies. It uses WW II for its background. Was it just propaganda? The threat of espionage is ever present in war or peace, whether a country is big or small. Past examples in European history provide examples. These movies with Basil Rathbone were popular on television decades ago, they set an example to match against other movies. Lord Haw-Haw broadcast propaganda from Germany during WW II. Universal Studios also produced many of the horror movies of that era about the Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, etc. These were also set in modern times, as were many of the Westerns popular then.",1453852800,2,2278,4.69

7815417,3,6301801202,"The initial 1942 entry in Universal's modernized Sherlock Holmes series doesn't match the high standards of later installments. Happily, the inimitable Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce compensate for a  routine script. Efficient direction by John Rawlins, but the atmospheric work of Roy William Neill proved a better fit.",1371081600,,320,5.666666666666667
7815418,3,6301801202,"This was the first in the 11 film series featuring Basil Rathbone ( excellent ) and Nigel Bruce (irritating ) as the great team of Holmes and Watson respectively .They are called in by the British government ,then conducting the war against Hitler , to unmask a traitor ,the eponymous Voice .He is infiltrating the airwaves broadcasting dire prophecies of defeat to the British nation .His prophecies of impending military disaster come true .In the face of opposition from some Cabinet members Holmes digs into the case uncovewring a traitor from within the Cbinet itself ,eventually unmasking the culprit in a climax in a ruined church
Good performances all round apart from Bruce ,who to be fair was compelled to play the role as bumbling comic relief and not the stalwart comrade that Doyle wrote .Henry Daniell is excellent as a supercillious civil servant who turns out to be on the side of the angels .
Enjoyable B -movie that shows what an accomplished actor Rathbone was -pure class in every role however under-written",1088121600,4,1027,4.908045977011494
