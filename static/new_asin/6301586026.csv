334174,5,6301586026,"If there is any romanticism in your heart, this movie will just sweep you away.  Two people who are engaged to others meet on a ship and they try to deny their feelings for eachother.  They decide that they need to take care  of all loose ends before they can continue past a stolen kiss (wonderfully  romantic) - and they decide to meet 6 months later (after they break their  engagements) on the top of the empire state building.  Tragedy of course  occurs, and the end doesn't leave a dry eye in the house.  Cary is at his  best, and Deborah Kerr is completely charming.",920851200,7,573,4.380952380952381

Can you go wrong with Cary Grant though? He's so sweet and charming.

Short summary:
Handsome playboy Nicky and singer Terry McKay have a romance while on a cruise from France to New York. Despite being involved with other people, both agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months time. However, an unfortunate event keeps Terry from meeting, and Nicky is afraid that she has married or does not love him anymore.",1512518400,,533,4.541666666666667

334241,5,6301586026,"This was a great movie. The clothing was so fine and beautiful. It was so much fun to watch and live vicariously through these love stricken jet setting people surrounded by divine things. The part when they were in the Chapel together and Nikki suddenly ""came down to earth"" because he was sharing such a personal, intimate experience of prayer and love with Terry was so poignant. After just revisiting Sleepless in Seattle, we realized that we had to finally see this move. We loved that Sleepless in Seattle continued this love affair with not only a love story but also the Empire State building. How romantic it all is. They are both wonderful and heart opening movies that will make you feel high on LOVE!",1510963200,,712,4.658730158730159

Grant was really at his peak of charisma and attractiveness here and Kerr is so lovely, warm and believable. It's a story from a lost era, with all the romance and sophistication of New York in the 50s. The musical numbers are a little corny, but it's fun to pick out the faces of kids who went on to have acting careers as adults. Beyond that, it reminds us that love happens to people, we don't choose it. But when it's the real thing, you better hold on tight.",1483401600,5,561,4.30188679245283

Spoil alert, both songs are fun to ride along with. I wonder why the doctor doesn't want her to go to the Christmas Program? I never figured that out and it' s a little absurd that Cary Grant can't figure out or even asks why  she's tied to the couch in the last scene but I love the way he discovers her uhhh, special need, classic.

Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant were expertly cast, especially Grant as Nicky. Turning the appauling playboy into a lovestruck schmuck is such a gratifying thread that only a great storyline could weave. Coupled with the scenes of his maman, their rapport, his devotion to her, and her openness to Kerr, just served to further the collective audience's heartmelt. Much of the banter in this movie is unscripted, by the way. Kerr and Grant were so in-sync that they were able to ad-lib whole swaths of dialogue (the ship scene by the pool) and banter with witty quips. I can't even with those two. Also, this is the film Sleepless in Seattle is drawing from. From one great film of the Silver Screen to another of the modern era, this tale is as old as time, but no one tells it quite like An Affair To Remember. DO NOT TURN IT OFF BEFORE THE END. You will be so sorry. And you will not reach your tear quota...",1476489600,,1048,4.407216494845361

Whoever made this decision ruined the presentation. My one star is for Amazon Prime's butchering of the original film. HDTVs can display CinemaScope movies beautifully. There was no need to chop off the sides and enlarge the middle and not even use all the pixels HDTV is capable of.

335803,3,6301586026,"Warning -- My review contains spoilers.

I watched this movie tonight knowing nothing about it.  Most people think this is a great movie.  I thought it was okay.  I didn't care for what I perceive to be a religious (Christian) angle to the movie.  Now most any movie can be made to look that way if the viewer has a mind for it (even if it wasn't intended by the director, script, etc.).  But this was out in the open.  It felt intentional.  The movie basically portrays two people having an affair but there's no sex and they never really get down to business.  It's all so clean.  Even the first kiss is hidden from the viewer.  All you see is legs on a staircase.  It's like porn for evangelicals.  Nothing against the actors.  And Cary Grant is always fun to watch.  But it felt like a morality play.  First there was the grandmother's chapel, then the priest and the kids singing a religious song and then Deborah Kerr gets hit by a car and breaks her legs (God's wrath? Karmic justice?).  No doubt, one's world view and beliefs, or lack thereof, will color how they think of this film.  In closing, I wish they would have spent more time with how the two main characters weaseled out of their prior romantic relationships -- which was all too easy in the movie -- and less time with Cary's grandmother and especially the kids singing.  That added nothing to the plot or story.",1462320000,,1382,4.412698412698413

Deborah Kerr, the same - elegance defined.  Don't be an ass - be the gentleman that you should be, and don't be afraid to show all the clods out there just how it's done.

It's a magnificent movie that will make you see that all tragedy and triumph does not occur in the sports arena.

336095,4,6301586026,"Cary Grant is not known for his superb acting and in most of his movies, there is a comic slant in his characters, though not all by his own making. But this film seems to have perfectly matched the flirty slant of Grant's acting (the other movies that come close to it were Suspicion and North by Northwest). The movie has beautiful characters, beautiful story and excellent music. Though both Grant and Kerr are at the top of their performance, the acting is not exactly tops to deserve 5 stars in my opinion. I also found the repeated chance-encounters between Grant and Kerr somewhat staged. But it is a beautiful movie to watch repeatedly which in my case, lets me discover new angles at every scene. I was particularly touched by the final scene which was also the best scene of the movie both in performance and dramatic effects.",1456531200,3,836,4.617449664429531

336623,4,6301586026,"In the beginning  Nicky Ferrante (Cary Grant) is sailing across the Atlantic to meet up with his fiance in New York City. During the trip Ferrante shows a romantic interest in Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr), who is also in a serious, committed relationship. Both Ferrante and McKay are being financially supported by their partners. Ferrante has a long history of changing women like most men change their underwear, until he got engaged to his fiance who is a multi-millionaire. Given his history, the beginning of the movie where Ferrante is making romantic gestures to yet another woman (McKay), is not very interesting and I fast-forwarded through part of it. During the trip the ship docks for a few hours and McKay accompanies Ferrante to visit his grandmother. The scenery is gorgeous and the two have a good visit with the elderly grandmother who likes McKay very much but the visit isn't anything special otherwise.
Near the middle of the film, though, viewers begin to see that Ferrante is serious about McKay and willing to work hard to have a successful relationship with her. We see what sacrifices both characters are willing to make so they can be together and the story becomes much, much better.",1441843200,,1208,4.892682926829268

336761,5,6301586026,"I loved every moment of this great movie. It must be one of the most romantic things I ever saw on the screen and the two main actors are simply unbelievably perfect. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

Nickie Ferrante (Cary Grant), is a man in his late 40s and a well-known playboy who until the beginning of the film had a pleasant but rather futile life. Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr) is a gal in her late 30s, who until the beginning of this film had a relatively comfortable but rather unsatisfying life. They are both involved with someone else. They meet aboard the Transatlantic ocean liner SS Constitution en route from Europe to New York and their first meeting doesn't go all that well. And then the film really begins and I will say nothing more about the story.

This film is a remake of 1939 ""Love Affair"", starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. I didn't see the 1939 film, but it seems that this remake is very faithful to the original - which is understandable, as both films had the same director, Leo McCarey.

""An affair to remember"" is a charming movie, with a great scenario and excellent dialogs. Both main actors were talented and experienced and director Leo McCarey led them with the skill of a great master. I don't think there is one scene or one dialog line which can be faulted here. Watching this film was pure pleasure from the first to the last second and at the end I had tears in my eyes - even if I am really NOT a young girl...

Parts of this film inspired ""Sleepless in Seattle"", but the story here is very, very different - and I like this film much more. A remake was also made in 1994, with the title switching again to ""Love affair"" and Warren Beatty and Annette Bening starring. I didn't see it but it bombed totally at the box office, was savaged by critics and was named for Razzie of worst remake or sequel - and honestly, once you saw this film you will probably understand why any idea of making a remake was probably a bad one. ""An affair to remember"" still didn't age one bit and I think it never will and remaking it is simply useless...

I will keep this review deliberately short because I really don't want to provide to much spoilers. It is a GREAT MASTERPIECE, deservedly loved and considered as one of the BEST LOVE STORIES ever shown on the screen. Buy it, watch it, love it and keep it for your children. ENJOY!",1439337600,,2391,4.412698412698413
336762,4,6301586026,"Cary Grant is so debonaire in this movie. Deborah Kerr is beautiful and witty.  She is the perfect foil for Grants bad boy.  This is a remake of a Chas. Boyer movie that my mother and I adored.  With all remakes some are good some not so good.  This one is good, but be sure to see the original.  Suspend your beliefs in reality as this love story is only loosely based on reality.  Be ready to swoon over Grant and Kerr.",1438992000,,421,4.073170731707317

Cary Grant is ever so save was usual meets  Deborah Kerr on an ocean liner where they both fall deeply in love. At the time both are engaged to other people. When it comes time to part they agree that if the romantic feelings remain to meet six months later at the top of the Empire State Building. An accident prevents their rendezvous as the twists begin.

336928,4,6301586026,"It's hard not to like Cary Grant movies, but if you've also seen the 1939 black-and-white film Love Affair with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne, it's much harder to really like this one as much. Both movies are essentially the same script, slightly different circumstances, and so on, but otherwise, the same story and much of the same dialog. My problem is that Irene Dunne was just so much more delightful in her role than Deborah Kerr was, and much easier to fall in love with, so to speak.

Nevertheless, both of these are classic romantic comedies, with memorable moments worthy of a view. This one, of course, was referenced in ""Sleepless In Seattle"" just in case you missed that. The signature climactic scene in her apartment is screenwriting at its very best.",1435276800,,766,4.7593984962406015

In this poignant and humorous love story nominated for four Academy Awards where Nickie [Cary Grant] and Terry [Deborah Kerr] meet on board an ocean liner and fall deeply in love.

FILM FACT: An Affair to Remember was nominated at the Academy Awards for four Oscars and they were Best Song, Best Cinematography, Best Score and Best Costume Design.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: An Affair to Remember is one of the most popular love stories ever made in Hollywood. Many fans would hail it as the most romantic film ever made. With its mix of sophistication and sentimentality, the film offers one of the most complete expressions of Leo McCarey's personality as a writer-director. In particular, auteur critics have hailed his ability to make the transition from comedy in the early scenes to the more deeply romantic mood of the film's ending, a characteristic of such other Leo McCarey films as Going My Way [1944] and The Bells of St. Mary's [1945].

Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories. . . Weve already missed the spring, laments Deborah Kerrs Terry McKay of the 1957 classic An Affair to Remember and an unforgettable romance that has managed to melt frost-bitten hearts everywhere for more than half a century. Though it is well-known for being the romantic film to end all romantic films, An Affair to Remember is more than a mere cultural touchstone and its a great film in and of itself.

Nickie [Cary Grant] a notorious playboy and Terry [Deborah Kerr], an heiress, meet on the SS Constitution ocean liner. Bonded by their shared love of the finer things in life (including but not limited to pink champagne and sailing around the Mediterranean), the two instantly hit it off. Exchanging witty banter and stolen glances, their chemistry is apparent. Theres only one problem, both parties are engaged to other people. Upon docking in New York City, the pair, unable to deny their mutual attraction, agrees to meet in six months time at the top of the Empire State Building. However, when an unfortunate accident hinders Terry from attending their reunion, it looks as though their seemingly-fated love affair is no longer on the cards. But, of course, the heart wants what the heart wants and as chance (or indeed, Hollywood) would have it, Terry and Nickie cross paths again in the most unexpected way.

This is a film about the slow-burn of attraction, delighting in the small moments that form the prelude to a kiss (and one of the most memorable on-screen first kisses of all-time, at that). Sparks fly as the couple tease one another with a barrage of whip-smart quips, the on-screen sexual tension between stars Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant is smouldering, who brings the film alive, managing to capture the inexplicable magic of falling in love.

In fact, its almost impossible not to feel ones own knees buckle as the dizzying intensity with which the couple fall in love unfolds. In one particularly beautiful scene, they visit Nickies doting Grandma Janou [Cathleen Nesbitt] in her home on the French Riviera. Nickies relationship with the tender-hearted Grandma Janou is a window that allows Terry a rare glimpse into the charismatic bachelors childhood. Cary Grant balances Nickies artistic sensibilities with cheeky cocksure confidence, showing us and indeed, seducing us with Nickies vulnerable side. And yet, despite their debonair appearances, it is the unsaid feelings and heart-pounding what-ifs that have us rooting for Nickie and Terry and reaching for the tissues right until the very end. Beautifully shot in vivid Color By DeLuxe, and accompanied by Harry Warrens rich, romantic score, this bittersweet romance is a nostalgic cinematic experience that has truly stood the test of time.

The result was An Affair to Remember [1957], one of the most popular love stories ever made in Hollywood. Many fans would hail it as the most romantic movie ever made. With its mix of sophistication and sentimentality, the film offers one of the most complete expressions of Leo McCarey's personality as a writer-director. In particular, auteur critics have hailed his ability to make the transition from comedy in the early scenes to the more deeply romantic mood of the film's ending, a characteristic of such other Leo McCarey films as Going My Way [1944] and The Bells of St. Mary's [1945]. The film was also Leo McCarey's last great success, capping a career that stretched back to the silent comedies he wrote and directed for Hal Roach.

An Affair to Remember was one of three 1957 films that brought Cary Grant out of retirement after his performance in To Catch a Thief two years earlier. With the critical and box-office failure of his other two 1957 films, The Pride and the Passion and Kiss Them for Me and it provided the success Cary Grant needed to keep him making films until his ultimate retirement in 1966. It remains one of his most popular films. The film also remains Deborah Kerr's most popular. Throughout her later years, she was always pleased when she met fans and they told her they had most recently seen her in An Affair to Remember and was the most successful of the three films Cary Grant made with Deborah Kerr. Although the two seemed perfectly matched, their other vehicles, Dream Wife [1953] and The Grass Is Greener [1960], did not capture their chemistry as effectively. The film was producer Jerry Wald's first under contract to 20th Century Fox, where he would finish his career with such acclaimed features as Peyton Place [1957], The Long, Hot Summer [1958] and Sons and Lovers [1960].

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films stunning Cinemascope aspect ratio of 2.35:1 is replicated to perfection and so is the beautiful 1080p encoded image transfer. Colour is nicely saturated without being overblown (though stock photography and rear screen projection looks much less impressive). Flesh tones, from the nut brown tan that Cary Grant sports to the peaches n cream complexion of Deborah Kerr, are spot on. Black levels aren't very deep and are the weakest aspect of the transfer. Its very clean, however, with no visible scratches or blemishes, and sharpness is nicely achieved.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Blu-ray offers both English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo. The 2.0 Dolby Digital stereo soundtrack is somewhat loud and it is a bit harsher sounding than the with the 5.1 DTS-HD MA mix, which is much more refined and smoother. Theres a tiny bit of hiss in some of the earlier quieter scenes of the film, but its never intrusive to the listening experience. Apart from the music score, there isn't much surround activity here. Dialogue is always easily discernible in the centre channel though it is clear there was quite a bit of work with the film soundtrack.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Beautiful 24 pages Collectable DigiBook Packaging: That features text about the story, the stars and the director, and also stills in gorgeous Colour and some mostly in Black-and-White photographs.

Audio Commentary: Audio Commentary by Singer Marnie Nixon and Film Historian Joseph McBride: The audio commentary is provided by American film historian Joseph McBride and singer Marni Nixon who talk lovingly about the Leo McArey remake of his original black-and-white Love Affair. Marni Nixon wished she had sung the film song title, but heaps great praise on Vic Damones interpretation of the films title song. We get to hear Joseph McBride has great affection to this film and the director, as he has so many interesting facts about the process of making An Affair to Remember. Another interesting information we hear is the fact that Marni Nixon had worked before with Deborah Kerr in dubbing her voice in the film The King and I, but because Marni Nixon had a years contract with NBC, she wondered how she could work on this particular film, but Deborah Kerr assured Marni Nixon that she knew how to dub her singing voice for this film. But to show how professional Marni Nixon was, because the film was released in different in different languages; well Marni Nixon assured the studio executives that she could sing in all the different languages. But overall I can really recommend you give this brilliant Audi Commentary a good try out, as Joseph McBride is a real joy to listen to and it is one of the best audio commentaries I have heard in a very long time.

Feature Documentary: Affairs to Remember: Deborah Kerr [2007] [1080p] [16:9] [5:34] Peter Viertel [Husband to Deborah Kerr] talks about he met Deborah Kerr, who was already married to Tony Bartley, who was extremely jealous of Ms. Deborah Kerr success and eventually they both got divorced. Sadly in her later years, Deborah Kerr suffered from a serious illness of Parkinson and eventually passed away in England on 16th October, 2007 at the age of 86.

Feature Documentary: Affairs to Remember: Cary Grant [2007] [1080p] [16:9] [9:48] Barbara Grant James [Cary Grants Widow] talks very affectionately about how she met Cary Grant in the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London. Barbara Grant admitted that she never hardly saw any of Cary Grants films and how charming he was off screen. Despite Barbara Grant and Cary Grant were both in a relationship at the time, but eventually grew closer together and finally both got divorced, and were finally able to live together until Cary Grant passed away on the 29th November, 1986 in Davenport, Iowa.

Feature Documentary: Directed by Leo McCarey [2007] [1080p] [16:9] [22:33] Scott McIsaac [Film Historian]; Paul Harrill [Author/Film Professor]; Peter Bogdanovich [Author/Film Maker]; and Rick Jewel [USC Professor Cinema-Television] talk glowingly about this giant among directors of his luminary work of his classic films. You hear about how Leo McCarey tried different career choices. First he tried to become a prize fighter, a miner, a sports writer for the LA Times. Then he went to the USC to study law and eventually became a lawyer, but this did not last long due to an unsuccessful court case that went badly wrong, and eventually got a job in Hollywood as a script girl for the director Todd Browning. When he finally got to direct films, he famously worked with Laurel & Hardy, Harold Lloyd, Mae West, The Marx Brothers, Charles Laughton, Cary grant, Irene Dunne and many more famous actors. He directed the Love Affair film and then went onto to do the remake An Affair to Remember. He also made other classic films, which included his last film he made was Satan never Sleeps which he hated directing, plus he hated all the actors and eventually sadly passed away suffering from emphysema in 1969.

Feature Documentary: A Producer to Remember: Jerry Wald [2007] [1080p] [16:9] [16:06] Malvin Wald [Brother to Screenwriter]; Robby Wald [Son]; Richard Baer [Writer]; Andrew Wald [Son] and Constance Wald [Widow of Jerry Wald] talk glowingly and affectionate about the life and times of this special Producer jerry Wald, who worked in different film companies from 1944 to 1962, who was also passionate about his work in films. The passion sort of started when Jerry Wald worked with his father, who to get any business, would tell them very elaborate stories, to the point he persuaded to get orders for the Company Jerry Walds father worked for. So this how Jerry Wald got into the film industry, as he could also weave a good story to the film executives to get certain stars into a particular film. But his greatest gift was working with top authors and turning their books into a working film script, and also appreciating the importance of the audience who went to see the films he worked on. He was totally motivated by the whole film industry and a total workaholic and sadly this was his undoing and eventually passed away at the age of 50 after three heart attacks. Despite this sad fact, his volume of work for the film industry, speaks for itself.

Feature Documentary: The Look of An Affair to Remember [2007] [1080p] [16:9] [9:01] With any film, it has to have a look, and also how the director and the production designer wants the film image looks in the frame and to guide us through this homage to An Affair to Remember we have contributions from John Cork [Film Historian]; Peter Bogdanovich [Author/Film Maker]; Wes Gehring [Author/Film Professor] and Rick Jewell [USC Professor Cinema-Television]. With all these contributors they give great praise on the director Leo McArey and his use of the CinemaScope aspect ratio, to make you fall in love with this particular film. One great surprise you hear is how Cary Grant insisted he wanted to shoot the film an actual liner, but Leo McArey insisted that he would only film most of the film on the backlot of the studio and that is why the director made An Affair to Remember such a magical joyous classic romantic film, that has stood the test of time.

Feature Documentary: AMC Backstory: An Affair to Remember [2001] [480i] [4:3] [24:27] This made for TV documentary, tells in great detail about the backstage story about the main stars Cary grant and Deborah Kerr, which reflected their screen personalities, and their secret private lives. People contributing to this documentary are Peter Bogdanovich [Author/Film Maker]; A.E. Holchner [Sophia Lorens Biographer]; Roy Mosley [Cary Grants Biographer]; Curtis Harrington [Former Assistant to jerry Wald]; Deborah Kerr [Actress]; Francesca Shrapnel [Deborah Kerrs Daughter]; Rudy Behlmer [Film Historian]; Nancy Nelson [Cary Grants Biographer] and Anne Hutton [Deborah Kerrs Manager/Friend]. We hear about when Cary Grant worked on the film The Pride and The Passion where he fell madly in love with the leading female star Sophia Loren, who was seriously romantically involved with producer Carlo Ponti. We also get to see a short clip from a very rare promotional film the 20th Century Fox presents A Special CinemaScope Picture entitled The Big Show to promote the film An Affair to Remember. Leo McCarey found two main stars got on very well together, that he allowed them to sometimes to improvise occasionally from the script. We also get lots of clips from the film, as well as certain outtakes. Although critics slated the film, but of course it was a massive big hit with audiences and also its deservedly Academy Awards Nominations. Narrated by Rino Romano.

Fox Movietone News: An Affair to Remember Shipboard Premiere Attracts Celebrities [1957] [1080p] [4:3] [00:56] This short film packs in a lot and you see most of the stars, as well as the director and producer involved with the film. But you also get to see other celebrities attending the premiere, which includes Celeste Holm, Shelley Winters, Arlene Dahl, Fernando Lamas and Deborah Paget.

Theatrical Trailer: [1957] [480i] [4:3] [2:53] Here we get to see the actual 20th Century Fox present a Special CinemaScope Picture The Big Show.

Finally, keep the Kleenex nearby for this 10 hanky tearjerker; its a classic of romantic cinema that has influenced the genre for decades of other romantic films. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr make it easy to believe everything about this love story. Cary Grant is a certain kind of charming that can never be duplicated. Hes the kind of actor that makes you fall in love with him no matter what year it is. The transition from playboy to love fool is so effortless for Cary Grant. His sincerity and expression in certain scenes makes you feel the way he does, as if another love like this will never come again. Deborah Kerr is a timeless beauty, who plays the part of the woman with strength well. Bottom line is, for those true romantics out there; this is one you shouldnt pass up. This is what a romantic film should be all about. A love like this goes hand and hand with class, something that many stars today cant even get close to. An Affair to Remember will always be one to remember. They don't make them like this anymore, so this is one to purchase for certain. It makes an excellent, stay-at-home romantic date night film especially, as well for the whole family. Highly Recommended!

337423,4,6301586026,"An Affair to Remember(July/57)stars,among others,Cary Grant,Deborah Kerr and Richard Denning. This film is a wonderful,bitter sweet one,full of romance and the charm only Cary Grant could project.
The story involves Grant as a high flying playboy. He is on an ocean voyage headed for France. On the ship also is Kerr who is engaged. The two strike up an innocent conversation. Kerr knows Cary's rep but is having nothing to do with it. Eventually however his charm and charisma start to break through her wall. She becomes intrigued enough at one point to tag along with him when they reach France. Cary tells her it is to go ashore and visit his grandmother. She doesn't believe a word. Well it turns out to be true and Kerr spends what she terms is the best day of her life,with she and the grandmother hitting it off remarkably well.
The two return to the boat and by this time Kerr's defenses are down to almost nothing. However, they have a tete a' tete,and Kerr decides they must try and remain aloof at least for the passengers sake,even though both are now head over heels in love. Before they're half way home a ships photographer has snapped a few ""compromising"" pictures of them and has started selling them to other passengers. After this they leave their cares behind them and act normally. What have they got to lose?
Once back in New York the two vow to meet in six months atop the Empire State Building,on July 1. Cary vows,in that time,to get honest work and start making a real living. To this end,being an ex-painter,he decides to start his craft up again. Meanwhile Kerr has broken the news to her boyfriend about she and Cary,and while taking it hard,remains friends and supportive of her. She continues her life and Cary's painting start to sell slowly but surely.
The magical date both have been waiting for comes and Cary is atop the building awaiting his love's arrival. Kerr takes a cab but gets stuck in traffic. Impatient she jumps out of the cab and runs towards her destination. However she gets struck down by a car and is paralyzed from the waist down. Cary waits until late at night for his love who will never arrive. Dejected he finally leaves during a thunderstorm.
Kerr ends up in the hospital for weeks and when finally released gets a position at a local parish helping teach the local youngsters in singing. Wheelchair bound,she doesn't want Cary to know anything about her accident until she can walk again and meet him on a ""normal""level.
Months go by and inevitably the two meet at a ballet as Cary is leaving;the first time since they last parted. She is seated so he won't know of her condition. The two say their polite hello's and part. Kerr's ex boyfriend has accompanied her and he wants to tell Cary on her behalf but she won't have it.
More time passes and it is Christmas. Who should knock on her apartment door but Cary. He has stumbled upon her address and phone number by accident. Cary you can tell is hurt, but he couches his words in subtle sarcasm,making like HE is the one who should apologize because HE didn't show up on the date they said they would. Kerr quickly gets his drift and she becomes very guarded in what she says. As he about to depart he tells her of a painting that he recently gave away( a portrait of her)to someone who couldn't afford it and in....his words drift off. He was going to say wheelchair, but the wheels in his mind are turning and he goes into the next room and there is the painting. It instantly becomes clear to Cary what has gone on. He returns to her and asks all the whys he needs to before they embrace,never to part.fade to black.
I found myself literally yelling at the screen at Cary near the end telling him to not leave,and to Kerr telling her to come clean about her illness. Such is the power of this film to draw you in. Leo McCarey(Laurel and Hardy's old director)is in fine form in this film and deftly directs the two through this romantic affair. It is nice how Kerr is at first wise to Cary's advances and how she rebuffs him,but eventually the circumstances overwhelm her and she can't fight what she feels any longer. Cary of course is always the gentleman,backing off at just the right time and coming back only at Kerr's behest. Also the scenes with Cary's grandmother in France were done especially well.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras abound in this 50th anniversary edition including commentary,the trailer,news footage of the premiere,and several featurettes and interviews. This is a two disc set.
All in all a fabulous film,full of romance and tears. As soon as the ship is sailing you are hooked. Kerr and Grant do a fabulous turn together and both are totally believable in their parts. 4 1/2 stars.",1425168000,,4782,4.568102444703143

The only exception to this was when he had the conversation with his grandmother, at the beginning of the story, that was kind of touching and he seemed a bit more believable in that scene.

337769,1,6301586026,"This is one of those movies I love to hate: it is brimming with schlocky 1950s pseudo-morality and pseudo-religiosity, all cloaked in hypocritical and puritanical ideas about sex. That morality rolls over the Deborah Kerr character like a steam roller: she gets put in a wheel chair for her sins, while the Cary Grant character gets off scott free after his callous treatment of all the women he's had. EXCEPT that he is condemned to paint embarrassingly ugly paintings which he tries to sell. I mean, really: what is the audience to think of the mercifully few glances we get of his paintings? Even by 1950s standards they are ghastly: I cringe in horror whenever they are shown.

There are so many awkward moments: where do I begin? The kiss off camera on the boat; the scenes in the ship's dining room with everyone laughing at the lovers; Kerr's religious experience in the grandmother's chapel: I had time to run to the kitchen and pop corn while she was in there praying for forgiveness. Thus, she is transformed from some guy's well-kept mistress/chanteuse into the best darn singing teacher for orphans in the city. (I fast-forwarded through the songs which were going to make me cringe even more than the paintings.)

Good things come to those who don't fornicate, I guess. The two chaste lovers are reunited at the end: I can just see them living on canned beans and franks, given the amount of money they'll be pulling in with her teaching and his, er, painting. This movie confirms my belief that the 1950s personified the banality of evil, as does the wretched title tune sung by Vic Damone.",1418601600,3,1604,4.725
337770,5,6301586026,"This 1957 film was a remake of one called LOVE AFFAIR made in 1939 starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. I have never seen that one. Another remake was made after this one starring Warren Beatty and Annette Benning, which I did see. It was a huge disappointment for me.

AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, which was made in 1957, in my opinion, is the GREATEST ROMANTIC MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I have seen it dozens of times and each time I do, I cry at the ending. It has been and always will be my favorite movie.

This is the film that Meg Ryan talks about in the movie SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, If you have seen SLEEPLESS...and are curious about the film she refers to, watch An Affair to Remember. It is a classic that will leave you wanting to watch it again and again! Hollywood just doesn't make them like this anymore!",1418601600,,845,4.3081761006289305

It seems this movie is based on a film called ""Love Affair"" which came out in 1939, and that there is a 1994 remake of that. I have not seen either, but would be interested to view them and compare.

""Sleepless in Seattle"" shows some clips from ""An Affair to Remember."" All said, I prefer ""Sleepless in Seattle"" over ""An Affair to Remember.""",1417996800,,511,4.483870967741935

Brilliant way to do it. Iconic acting. Even a bit of humor peppered throughout. Best part was the visit to grandmother's house. It brought so much warmth to the characters and to the movie as a whole.
Note: Technically both of these characters are ""cheating"" on their lovers, but as no one is married at the time, it's not as awful as cheating on a marriage.",1414454400,,521,4.612903225806452

For the first hour, it was light and fluffy, as one expects from this genre.  However, half way through, Deborah Kerr gets hit by a car, and the plot becomes incomprehensible.  Turns out there's a reason Cary confined himself to the 40s-50s stuff with cocktails and cigarettes.  He was great at being debonair in the ubiquitous tuxedo.  Remember ""Arsenic and Old Lace""? Wonderful!  When Cary tries to show deep affect because of the injury, it is a disaster.
Give this one a pass.",1413936000,,590,4.782178217821782

338258,5,6301586026,"The ending which Cary used reverse psychology for apology was impeccable.  The words evoked Deborah in deep emotion especially about the thunderstorm.  This really differentiate current romance movies with speaking love out loud and action in order to charm the ladies.  The classic to remember is to show love in a subtle way which they know deep down rather than expressive through words or actions.  I wish movies can make like this again.  In fact, why doesn't Hollywood remake these classic movies using the same stories.  Perhaps the difficult part is to find the right actor/actress with right chemistry to make it believable.",1413849600,,633,5.097087378640777

338347,5,6301586026,Cary Grant is so prolific as an actor. While I did not grow up when he was acting in films I have enjoyed many of them. An Affair to Remember is a sentimental love story where the characters are likeable and the acting enjoyable. If the story was told today it would be filled with explicit innuendo and foul language.

338452,5,6301586026,"Classic movie with Carrie Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Yes, it is horribly tied to its time and sensibilities...expect that.  Sleepless in Seatle tried to update the movie and did so (in my opinion, fairly successfully).  But, this classic is to be watched on its own merrits.

What I enjoyed most:  The time they give the actors to act... to build their emotions to the point where they are going.  Notice, for instance, when we meet Nicolo's grandmother: She doesn't know that he is ""home"" and builds to an excitement that is palpable.  In addition, Kerr's performance is a treasure, as she knows that Grant's character is not to be trusted, not to be respected...and yet, in the midst of her hesitations, we see her see him for what he could be... and for what he is, when not in the media spotlight....and she responds to THAT person, slowly...building from her reserve to her acceptance, and yes, love.

What I didn't care for:  [plot foreshadowing] the heroic, ""I am not worthy of his love now that I am a cripple"" just doesn't work.  I can't imagine it working then, and it certainly doesn't  now.  But, I suppose we are suppose to view it as just hideous pride, that Grant's character must somehow overcome.

Worth the watch.  To be sure, women will likely enjoy the show on different levels and intensities.  The whole ""Affair to Remember"" genre is bound to bring tears and hope for a love that would give up all, that would pine for years, that would do everything to bridge the gap (yes, even the gap that she builds unnecessarily through senseless pride) in order to have the love he so ardently desires.
And to be sure, it is his dedication to the love he has for his beloved that makes this work so well.",1413072000,,1714,4.555555555555555

338487,5,6301586026,"Absolutely one of the greatest (if not the greatest) romance movies of all time. The timeless Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr demonstrate a chemistry that is rarely seen on the silver screen. A remake of the 1939 'Love Afffair', it follows it's predecessor scene for scene. The original was so successful that the original director Leo McCarey, hit a major home run with his second direction of the story.
Cary Grant originally declined the role but when Deborah Kerr (the third pick for the character McKay) was signed he insisted on having the part. He so loved working with Kerr and hoped to be able to co-star with her once more.
For such an early movie the characters were amazingly believable for the period. A true great film with the perfect leading cast. This film was remade again in 1994, 'An Affair'.
Once of my favorite all time moves that I can watch and watch again. An Affair to Remember is unquestionably one of the greatest love stories both in plot and chacterization to ever hit the silver screen.",1412985600,4,1013,4.664804469273743

I remember seeing it at the time, but wow! How times and our perceptions have changed! Deborah Kerr looked like she was wearing all-over clown-white makeup next to Cary's permanent dark tan. And my dear, the gown she wore--in the day time on ship board. Cary Grant--already old at that time, but always charming and irresistible. Don't know how men find him though. I'd be interested to hear. Would have liked to have been able to sit through it--as I remember, it was a rather sweet, though gooey, romantic story. Ah well.",1412812800,2,662,4.525

And of course I saw it often through the years on tv.  An ideal motion picture....beautiful, a tear jerker.

So naturally when it popped up on my Prime I hurried to watch it again.

But there was something wrong.  I think it was the color.  it destroyed the beauty.

When an artist plans a masterpiece in soft blacks and greys, it is made that way and it fits.  When harsh brighter lights and garish colors are added. it isn't right.  I found I simply could not watch it.  I did not finish it.",1412812800,,754,4.35251798561151

338594,4,6301586026,"This film is personally interesting to me as I wasn't even a year old when it was made. Considered to be one of the most classic romantic movies of all time, the film was actually a remake of McCarey's 1939 film Love Affair, starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. In this 1957 (Cary Grant) remake, French playboy Michel Marnet and American Terry McKay fall in love aboard ship despite both being nearly engaged to someone else. They arrange to reunite 6 months later, after they detach gracefully from their existing relationships and Michel has had a chance to earn a decent living. The cruise, the ending is a classic.

The acting is excellent, with even the pregnant pauses of a new relationship handled with authenticity. so while this is basically a classic chick's flick, from a man's perspective it's great to see Grant deftly handling the lady, the on-lookers, and his other relationships with aplomb.",1412812800,,910,4.870967741935484

The ending is amazing. Although the main characters' love affair is out of moral code, their love affair prove itself as true love due to the ending. Years went by, and both characters couldn't keep the promise as they wished, but still their love still withstands. I like the last sentences that Miss Mckay says, ""It was nearest thing to heaven. You were there. Darling, don't worry...If you can paint, I can walk. Anything can happen. Don't you think?"" This movie makes me want to believe that true romantic love exists.

I felt nothing watching this and i didn't care whether they got together in the end.  They needed to cut out the scenes with the children all together.  I just found them annoying and fast forwarded through the last one when they came to see her before their Christmas program - enough already.

An Affair to Remember is the epitome of romantic movies acted by two screen legends, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. The story line includes many wonderful scenes to their meeting on the cruise line and at Nickie's grandmother's house when Cary Grant plays the piano.

The movie itself was really good.  I rented with my husband on VDay since neither of us had seen it, but had heard about it for years.  What stuck out to me was Deborah Kerr's character and dialogue.  She was easy to like and relate to, even in modern day time frame.  That of all things is what will help this movie endure as a classic film forever.  There are some over the top movie tactics rarely seen in modern cinema, like the children's choir performing two songs, including a dance number.  Other than those entertainment ploys that pull against the story line, this movie seemed to really nail the emotion and characters that make a romantic comedy great.",1393372800,,824,4.595890410958904

339500,5,6301586026,"This old romantic story still charms mainly because of the chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant. Grant's usual casual wit and charm are never more on exhibition than in this flick, but Kerr displays her own comedic style that never becomes slapstick. This witty soaper is set on a luxury liner sailing between Europe and the USA with a stop along the French Riviera. Cathleen Nesbitt makes an appearance as Grant's widowed grandmother. This chick-flick made a surprising come-back  after it was touted in ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" but the charm of the film is not so much in the story line as it is in the on-screen chemistry between Grant & Kerr.",1373932800,,654,4.787610619469026

Alone, or with a girlfriend, I appreciated each emotion and character nuance portrayed by the actors.  This is a fine classic movie that will stand forever in outstanding movie romances.

339502,2,6301586026,"I saw another review that called this film Hokey. I was thinking sappy, over produced romantic tripe myself.  I think with someone different from Gary Grant it might have worked better.  He was and always will be Gary Grant and he wasn't believable in this part. His performance makes Deborah Kerr's performance seem to be too sappy and forced too.  The whole thing tells like a fairy tale with the picturesque grandmother in the picturesque villa on the picturesque island and, of course, the picturesque lace shawl. I love old classic movies as much as anybody and probably more than most but I don't like to find myself cringing at the too beautiful people doing too much emoting just to get to the final scene which is, of course, too overdone as is the rest of the movie. It would have been a wonderful movie but they just Hollywooded it up to the point where it is damned near insufferable and certainly embarrassing.",1373673600,,923,4.6503067484662575

I will now get my love of romance with watching this in good color and not woren.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is clean, full of fun and the two of them are wonderful in their parts.  You get a little of everything.  I loved her meeting him, her humor, his love of her humor, and then they began.  He keep running into her and both are on a trip to go home to marry someone else.  They fall in love, but the scene of his taking her to his Grandmother and then the love of that area up on the Mt looking down and the sound of the boat whistle for them to leave was so touching, as was the scene of her singing to the Grandmother playing the piano, the lovely area that one would have to whisper as it is so beautiful.  The best movie that Cary Grand and Deborah Kerr ever made.  It is my faovirte of them.  So happy to have it.  Get it, you will never be sorry, and you have a clean movie with lots of things going on.  It is a show stopper!

339642,5,6301586026,"Whatever movies these two made together was romance magic.  They had a great chemistry. This movie requires tissues, at least two boxes. They capture each others heart and then yours.",1361318400,,183,5.1
339643,3,6301586026,"I am trying to get into the shoes of director Leo McCarey... Why would he repeat practically the same film after the 1939 ""A Love Affair?"" of his? Maybe he counted on the ongoing popularity of Cary Grant in the 1950's to revive his own directorial career. He partly succeeded with the approach - ""An Affair to Remember"" is a much-better known film than its predecessor, starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. That's what you call marketing / public relations.

Still, the 1939 version has at least three things better than this one. First, it is some 25 minutes shorter (Deborah Kerr's 1957 singing exercises with her pupils are very tedious).

Second, there is a greater chemistry between Boyer and Dunne (subjectively, of course) - without taking any merit away from artistry of Grant or Kerr. And there are other things. For example, I do not have to wait to be moved until the final scene. My eyes are already wet when Terry comes back to hug Michel's grandmother goodbye in her home at Madeira.

And third... the 1939 film just has that real (although hard to define) class and rings with more genuine emotion.

""An Affair to Remember"" is one of the films, which reputation is in actuality better than the movie itself. I know this is a notorious tearjerker and a sentimental favorite for many and the template for Sleepless in Seattle (which in my opinion is not even best Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan collaboration). But still - if you like this one, you may well find ""A Love Affair"" even better. No wonder, really - it was produced in 1939, alongside such great movies as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Ninotchka"" or the French gem ""Rules of the Game"".

And as for directorial class of Leo McCarey, check ""A Night at the Opera"" with Marx Brothers, ""The Awful Truth"" combining Cary Grant and Irene Dunne (that's chemistry!) and even ""Going My Way"" / ""The Bells of St Mary's""  with Bing Crosby.",1361232000,,1916,4.670623145400594

For the life of me, I can't understand why she would keep from finding him after the accident.  If she really loved him, how could she stay away?  Through that whole last part of this movie I kept asking my wife to explain it.  If it pride it was pretty stupid.  Oh, and let's not forget the singing!  What were they thinking??  I don't get it!  All those annoying singing segments.

For me, even if you take out the singing and the crazy last part, there is still something missing.  It's just a weak story that is saved only by the greatness of Cary Grant.

I already own the original starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, and love it, so this remake was acquired mainly out of curiosity. Distinct disappointment! Woefully wooden acting, especially on the part of the marvelous Cary Grant, who usually performs masterfully in any role. Deborah Kerr wholly lacking in Irene Dunne's warmth, charm and spontaniety, looking very lackluster throughout but giving a bit more to her role than her flat co-star.
The sets and costumes monochrome, utilitarian in feel and lacking glamour. More specifically, I find myself wondering why he likes her, and why she likes him, and above all why I am sitting through this film. The production team is virtually the same, but alas, the times have changed. The collie dog outside the chapel door (if I'm not mistaken, actually the film star, Lassie) does give a superior performance to its counterpart's in the 1939 version... but how I miss Maria Ouspenskaya and 'Plaisir d'Amour' as sung by the talented Dunne!  Can but shake my head over all the good reviews on here.  This film for me is flawed and flat and slow-moving, lacking sparkle, lacking warmth.

I was excellent acting. Everything was well-done, including the scenery, fashions, etc.
The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was the obvious deliberate display of not showing a lip to lip kiss. I looked all over the internet for an answer as to why this was not displayed in this movie, but I could not find the answer. It really was very unnatural, especially at the end of the movie, when these two characters, who are so in love with each other, and finally are committed to each other for life, are filled with emotion of love, do not kiss lip to lip.
Also, it was very obvious and also awkward to not show their kiss on the boat, on the stairs. It was as though the camera shot was a mistake.
My only reasoning is that either Deborah Kerr or Cary Grant requested that they should not kiss lip to lip, and the director may have had to work the movie shots in a different way.

I rented the 50th Anniversary Edition to see what extras were included and after watching them, I went out and bought the set immediately.  We all know that the movie is terrific, but the bonus DVD was filled with wonderful information that makes movie buffs squeal with delight.  There were wonderful interviews with Peter Viertel and Francesca Schrapnel, Deborah Kerr's husband and daughter, and Barbara Grant, Cary Grant's widow. There is even a brief snippet of Ms. Kerr, probably from the late 80s, before she became ill. I especially found poignant the fact that the copyright on these interviews was 2007 which was the year that both Ms. Kerr and her husband died and the fact that he talked about how limited she was with Parkinsons. It made me sad that such a lovely and talented lady spent her later years living with such a horrible disease.

339832,3,6301586026,"Although directed by McCarey, this film can't compare to his original Love Affair. Grant and Kerr, albeit their good acting, seem to be trying to imitate the gestures of the actors in the original film. It seems that McCarey wanted to repeat the film in the exact manner as in the original.

Secondly, the scene where the leading lady prays to the virgin has a better effect in the first film. The Virgin looks quite impressive, and the light shining upon the woman lends her a powerful image of redemption for the millionaire playboy. The room and the light both give that scene a mystical quality that explains why the playboy would change. The light also shines on Irene Dunne which connects her to the mystical qualities of Michel's religion, the devotion of his mother, and his cultural background. The use of light and shadow (perhaps a quality of German Expressionism) in this scene can explain a change of heart in Michel.  In the Grant/Kerr picture this scene loses that power. It seems as if the color version steals the emotional depth of this scene. In this film, the room looks too ordinary and the virgin is only a small image on a table. The use of color also takes away the color effects of the earlier scene. Other scenes where Affair to Remember have a weaker effect on the audience are: the part when the lady looks at the Empire State Building (it looks so much smaller); the part where the leading lady is singing in the restaurant (Kerr couldn't match the dynamism of the original actress); and the picture painted in this latter film was less impressive than the original one where the woman's shroud was stressed.

I think that the Grant/Kerr presence made them, the stars, the major attraction, making everything else less important in this film. It was as if McCarey repeated this film for the sake of having these two great stars working in this romantic tale. McCarey's original was trying to convey a genuine romantic tale.",1302825600,,1952,4.701754385964913
339833,5,6301586026,"I first came across this movie after having watched Sleepless In Seattle. In that story the characters talked about the An Affair To Remember and the tragic meeting at the Empire State Building and the love affair that almost never happened. Of course, those who know Sleepless In Seattle realise that a lot of its story comes straight out of An Affair To Remember! Although I like both stories, An Affair to Remember has more depth than Sleepless. The sophistication of Cary Grant with the devil-may-care attitude makes a lot of the movie and the twist with the love of a woman who never turns up for their date, months after they have met. It is a good story!
The disc itself is great too. The picture quality on Blu-Ray is very good and majority is very sharp. The extras on Blu-Ray include Cary Grant's life along with interviews of people who knew him, lived with him or were friends. Overall a very good disc and one to bring out for a romantic night with a partner. Highly recommended.",1300320000,4,992,4.5474860335195535

339835,5,6301586026,"""An Affair to Remember"" is said to be number 5 out of the top 100 romantic movies of all time by AFI. That's a pretty big claim and having never seen this film before, I really was curious if it would live up to the hype. This film has been referenced in the movie ""Sleepless in Seattle"" where Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan eventually met at the top of the Empire State Building and more recently in the TV Show, ""How I Met Your Mother"" where a tactic out of Barney Stinson's playbook is to go up to women at the top of the Empire State Building and say, ""He's not coming."" It's worth dusting this one off in your memory and watching it again and I dare say I might have a little old school crush on 1957 Cary Grant.
The Blu-ray disc is housed in a collectible book format, a very thin case, great if you need the storage space in your collection. Built into the case is 24 pages of images and stories from the film and behind the scenes of the film and personal lives of the actors, director, and producer. It is easy to see when the actors are on a sound stage versus a location, but the lighting and costumes are fantastic and the performances are so engrossing that those tiny details won't matter so much. The Blu-ray keeps the picture clean and crisp with the focus always on faces.

The premise is that two people have a chance meeting on a ship and have an instant attraction to each other. Nickie, played by Cary Grant, is a world traveling playboy engaged to a wealthy heiress and can't stop looking at other women, but is particularly intrigued by this woman who doesn't fall immediately to his charms and turns him down. Terry, played by Deborah Kerr, is an uptown English woman raised in Boston, a former night club singer, and has been groomed to be a good wife to her nice guy husband-to-be who wanted to take her away from her former life and put her in a penthouse. Nickie and Terry keep bumping into each other and when others on the ship begin to notice, they eventually give up the charade of indifference and spend some precious few moments together. They agree that if they are meant to be together, they should meet in six months on the Empire State building.  I won't spoil the ending (which has already been spoiled if you've seen ""Sleepless in Seattle"") but I'll just say that while I didn't actually cry, my heart did swell up for the both of them.

The film itself still holds up amazingly well. Today we might scoff at the creative pursuits both leads attempt to make themselves worthy of each other apart from their rich significant others, but it still doesn't stop it from being endearing. It's unrealistic for Nickie to succeed as a painter under a fake name and Terry as a singer, but through goodwill, hope, and persistence, they make it happen despite bumps in the road. If I had to change one thing about this film, I would nix the kids. Terry's career takes a hit after an unfortunate incident and she decides to ""coach"" a children's singing group and they are a little annoying and could stand to go.

Bonus Features:

There are featurettes on both lead actors. Deborah Kerr's is from her husband's point of view. He had been previously married and she had been in a relationship when the two met and they eventually married and spent four decades together and he talks about how she was a model wife and mother. Cary Grant's is from his widow's point of view and once again, he and his future wife were both in relationships with other people when they met as well. She put off his advances at first and eventually realized he was interested in her. He was married four times before marrying Barbara Harris who was 47 years younger than him. They only had five years of marriage before he passed away.

There's also a feature on director Leo McCarey whose films were nominated for 36 Oscars and won 3. He had an amazing and tumultuous personal life before going into Hollywood. ""An Affair to Remember"" was actually a remake of a previous film he had done called ""Love Affair."" Then there's a featurette on the producer, Jerry Wald, a great storyteller. Last there are several short featurettes on the look of the film with lighting, set pieces, and making a sound stage feel intimate and concentrate on the actors. The AMC backstory talks about the impact this film had a pop culture, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and the background of Cary Grant being in love with Sophia Loren while being married to Betsy Drake and having a short affair she ended and he attempted to continue during the film.

All in all, a well-done collector's Blu-ray of a wonderful timeless romance in a thoughtfully thin book case to better fit on your shelf.",1298419200,3,4661,4.482921083627797
339836,5,6301586026,"I have read a previous review on here bemoaning the quality of the image on this Blu-ray; guaging the period in which this film was released and the instability of the film stock (3 strip Technicolor was long gone), the High-Def version on this disc is probably the best this movie is going to look. There is also quite a bit of process photography going on in this film, which also does very little for a high-quality detailed image. Mixed all together, it is somewhat unfair to expect a movie from 1957 to look as good as a current movie or even an older movie that hails its source from a Technicolor negative. That  being said...I am personally very happy with the way the movie appeared on my home theater system. The sound is not extremely dynamic or jarring, but the lush orchestration and witty dialogue is clean and crisp and makes for a more than pleasant experience.

The story will tear at your heart strings; although not necessarily the most innovative premise, it succeeds because of the perfect chemistry between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Their subtle comedic timing and ways with a line keep the movie from getting overly sentimental or trite. There is the perfect mix of comedy and pathos. Their characters meet aboard a luxury liner, and both are in loveless relationships that have allowed them to live a complacent (you could substitute the word ""kept"") lifestyle. Reawakening their passions not only about each other but their lives and artistic talents, the two part from their cruise vowing to make it possible to be reunited in 6 months once they sort their lives out. That is as far as I'll go on the plot line.

The highlights of the film include a visit to Grant's character's grandmother's home. She is a wise woman  nearing the end of her life, and expertly played by Cathleen Nesbitt. It is her wisdom and desire for Grant and Kerr to be together that helps the two see what a vibrant life they could have together. The low points are few, but they do exist, particularly in the musical numbers towards the end where Kerr's character is a music teacher for children. These scenes are really dated and somewhat stereotypical. They slow the pace of the movie down somewhat.

This blu-ray set comes in a Digibook case with a beautifully illustrated 26 page book with background info on the movie and the stars. The extras are wonderful, too:

* Commentary by Singer Marni Nixon and Film Historian Joseph McBride: The commentary is mainly from McBride, but there are a number of times where Nixon jumps in to discuss her relationship with Deborah Kerr and how she prepared herself to dub Kerr's singing voice for the movie, as well as dubbing Kerr for the foreign versions. McBride's comments are very informative and interesting as well. Worth listening to.

* Featurette: Affairs to Remember - Deborah Kerr (5:32 480i): Details Kerr's unhappy marriage that she was suffering through while making this movie and the love she found with her next husband.

* Featurette: Affairs to Remember - Cary Grant (9:47 480i): This one discusses Grant's love for Sophia Loren after they had an affair during the previous movie they made together. Grant was already married, but that didn't deter him from pursuing Loren, even though she went back to Carlo Ponti after they completed the movie.

Both star's unfulfilled romances most likely added to the poignancy of the story they were playing out for the cameras.

* Featurette: Directed by Leo McCarey (22:33 480i): Not necessarily a name remembered today, the man was responsible for some of the most beloved comedies by Laurel & Hardy and the Marx Brothers. This is a short look back at his career and how important it was for him to make a comeback with this particular movie.

* Featurette: A Producer to Remember: Jerry Wald (15:59 480i): One of the hardest working men in the biz, his family fondly remembers how would alternate between making ""money"" movies and ""arty"" (or more redeeming) pictures. A master of publicity, he knew how to pick movies with great stories and scripts.

* Featurette: The Look of Affair to Remember (8:53 480i): Discussing the colors (such as the orange palette of Kerr's clothing), settings, and processes used to make this film to give it the dreamy and artificial look that it has.

* AMC Backstory Episode: ""An Affair to Remember"" ( 24:27 480i ): A look back at the production of the movie, with some duplication of info from the other featurettes shown here. Still very enjoyable. Interesting that Cary Grant was initially upset about 2 things on this movie: the New York Empire State Building being swapped out for San Francisco for the climactic ending and also the fact that the movie was being filmed on a soundstage and not overseas on location. Grant won out on 1 out of the two gripes!

* Movietone Newsreel (Shipboard Premiere) ( :56 480i )

* Trailer (2:53 480i)

339837,2,6301586026,"This review is not about the movie, which I love, but about the blu-ray transfer.  I was hoping for a quality level at least as good as what has been done with some other classic movies, such as White Christmas, for example, which was an awesome restoration compared to this one. This was one of the classic movies I was hoping they would bring to blu-ray, and I was excited when it was announced. Well, I bought the blu-ray for a ridiculous premium price, and now I've watched it, and the jury is in. Very disappointing from the very first frame. Detail is lacking, colors are muted. The print looks dull and aged. There is not one single time where you are struck by an awesome picture.  Yes, it's an improvement over any previous release of the movie on dvd, but nowhere near the potential that blu-ray has to offer. It just doesn't look like a first-rate restoration of a worthy classic movie. Definitely not worth a premium price, and it's very misleading how they offer it in the digibook case, which makes it appear like this is an example of the best that blu-ray has to offer.  If you can wait long enough, they should eventually stick the disc in a cheap plastic box and sell it for a much lower price more in keeping with the level of quality for this transfer.",1296691200,32,1272,4.427350427350428
339858,1,6301586026,"For years and years I've heard about this movie, how great and romantic it is. So when I saw it was on my local cable companies free on demand TCM movie channel I decided to take two hours and watch it. I now thank my lucky stars I did not buy this movie.

Don't get me wrong. I love and am a huge fan of romantic movies. But this movie? I feel I must be missing something or have watched a different version of the movie than most people have seen.

Where exactly is the chemistry between Gary Grant and Deborah Kerr? I didn't notice any real chemistry between them during the entire movie. The dialogue between them didn't inspire any passion that I could see. Then there were all the other items in this movie that made my go UGH. My first cringe was the dinner scene on the boat and the other passengers laughing. Come on, this would never happen. People might stare for sure, but to break out in such laughter? Then there is Terry McKay's long suffering boyfriend Ken Bradley. What man is going to keep hanging on like this? Ken had the looks (for the time the movie was made) and his character apparently had money, so why would any guy in his right mind keep hanging on and waiting around for a woman who is in love with someone else? Ken needed to grow a backbone (among other things) and tell Terry to push off. Don't even get me started with Nickie's fiancee Lois Clark. Personally I can't see Nickie's character blowing off all that money for someone he thinks he loves and whom he just met. Come on, this just isn't how things work in the real world.

Then there are the other really annoying parts of the movie itself. Can you say ""Treacle Children's Choir""? To sit through the first scene with them was bad enough, but two scene's? The second scene in Terry's apartment is beyond watching so I hit the fast forward button double quick. Plus does anyone notice in the first scene when the children sing only the two black children come down in front and dance? OMG! I guess this was acceptable for the time the movie was made, but now? (By the way, I'm caucasion and this part of the movie really bothered me)

The only part of the movie that showed any promise is when Nickie see's the painting on the wall of Terry's bedroom. At this one point in the movie you can see some real emotion come through on the face of Mr. Grant.

Like I said I'm glad I didn't buy this movie and it certainly is a mystery to me on what makes it ""one of the most romantic movies of all time"". Personally I wish the movie script had been thrown overboard.",1296432000,7,2548,4.288981288981289

339860,5,6301586026,An Affair to Remember is a must see and not simply for those who love romance.  It truly is a cinematic masterpiece that defines one of the greatest eras in film.  The manner in which the narrative unfolds is imaginative and heart warming.,1294099200,2,239,4.534883720930233
339861,4,6301586026,"Cary Grant says more in his body language than 99% of actors today can say with 100's of pages of script.  His acting is timeless, the last scene when he discovers who owns his ""best"" painting is classic, no actor today can match this response, he says volumes as he stands in the open door, his face registering a thousand unspoken words, then turns to return to Kerr with the answer to all the questions she refused to address.  He moves like a dancer with a fluid grace that is amazing to watch, he glides rather than walks and has an confident eloquence few actors can achieve.  Cary Grant movies lack the ""face sucking"", open-mouth, jaws-like kisses movie makers and lesser actors need today to translate ""romance"" into a movie but Grant exudes more sexual attraction and heart-warming romance than them all.  He and Kerr play well off each other in this movie, it doesn't come up to the electrified chemistry with Ingrid Bergman in Notorious--but that's a movie in a class by itself.

339865,5,6301586026,"""An Affair to Remember"" is an almost perfect film. It is as deep and rich as it is stylish and romantic. And if someone tells you it is just a soap opera -- that person would be very, very wrong.

Yes, the film has style to burn. Deborah Kerr was never more beautiful. Her skin looks like cream; her pert, pinched nose like a blossom. She's never been more appealing than she is here. The scene where she smiles from a boat at her fianc on shore alone is worth the price of admission.

Cary Grant seems to sleep in tuxedos. He is a walking model of male perfection.

Less observant viewers come away from this movie thinking that nothing happened, that nothing was ever at stake, that nothing was risked or gained. How wrong they are.

Kerr's amazing dresses -- how about the one with the pumpkin colored ribbons woven through the front? -- Grant's suavity, and the south of France settings are not just there to pose for the camera.

All of the beauty of this film is there to do very hard work -- to tell a less than beautiful story.

And, no, this is not a movie where nothing happens. Something is happening in every scene -- you just have to be paying attention, and you just have to be mature enough, or have your antenna up high enough, to catch the subtle messages the film is sending, and to feel in your own solar plexus, the resonances of loves, dreams, and selves risked and gained, or lost.

Nicki and Terry are both gambling much here. They are wounded people in a world of high glamor; they speak in arch codes, even as their hearts are bleeding, or their breath is caught against the cage of dreams.

Grant's character, Nicki Ferrante, is a lazy gigolo. ""Gigolo"" is a pretty word for an ugly situation. Ferrante is a talented artist, but he knows that he can market something else he does -- seduce women -- far more easily, and for a higher price, than he can get for his paintings.

Kerr's character, Terry McKay, as she says, had to grow up very fast, and fight off a boss who -- well -- she faced some bad stuff in her life. When a steady, but less than thrilling, man offered to set her up, she, no fool, took the offer.

These are two beautiful people swanning through life over some very ugly circumstances. They have both sold their best selves for easy money.

And, then, completely by chance, on shipboard, they meet their soul mates. This meeting doesn't just present them with an opportunity for a one night stand. It demands that they face their own fears, and become their best selves.

I'm one of those cynical people who doesn't believe in love, never mind soul mates, but this movie carries it all off so well, it makes me believe.

Grant and Kerr begin with the lightest, and subtlest, of exchanges. they say things to each other -- example: ""I'd be surprised if you were surprised"" -- that, if you are not paying attention and that if you don't know a lot about life -- would just go over your head.

Slowly but surely their effervescent, and yet irresistible, attraction becomes truly heavy. The scene with Grandmere Janou (Cathleen Nesbit) is amazing for all it says, without actually saying anything.

I could see a naive film-goer taking in that scene and then asking, ""What was the point of that scene?"" You really have to have your eyes on the screen, and have a sensitivity to human interactions. Who is looking at whom; whose face is suddenly hidden and why; who is saying what without actually saying it; and why does the sound of that boat whistle bring tears -- you have to be willing to pay attention, and to have a sense of life and human relationships, and, yes, an openness to the possibility of there being a God to understand that scene.

Here you have a man and a woman who have, basically, sold themselves to the highest bidder, and who, at that point, are perilously close to cheating. What happens? Their love is blessed by the Virgin Mary. Heavy stuff.

""We changed our course today."" Truer words were never spoken.

I've got to hand it to Leo McCarey, who wrote and directed this film as well as the Academy Award winning ""Going My Way."" He so wonderfully brings the best, and most complex, aspects of Catholicism to the screen here. Catholicism is associated with the romance languages -- French, Italian -- and it also is friendly to this kind of romance -- a romance where fallen beauties are blindsided by the kind of tortuous, redemptive, overwhelming, fated love that demands, and gets, everything, after which, you are never the same.

If you haven't seen the movie, or ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as, really, very few films I've ever seen can make me cry. These tears are their own species.",1283644800,2,4765,4.494212962962963

I wish I could say there were no bad bits in this movie, but I am bound to honesty. I was not a fan of either rendition of ""Tomorrow-Land,"" and the whole children's chorus thing got way too much play. Maybe I am also a little tired of the ""Sharp-Eyed Old Lady Full of Wisdom and Matchmaking Inclinations"" movie cliche, but I guess that was only one scene (albeit an important one) in the midst of an epically wonderful movie that I otherwise loved every moment of. And the score was ... ever-present. The nicest way of putting it. But those are minor complaints.

Watch this movie for:
The chemistry. The way they met. The brief scene where she's leaving the dining hall just as he goes in, so she tells him to try the bouillabaisse and he just says ""Oh, shut up."" The sentimentality (if you like that sort of thing), the title song, their stubbornness, how much of a twerp Nick is, and how movie-magically-easy it was to turn him from a devil-may-care playboy into a deeply feeling and goodhearted potential husband. How Terry was always able to laugh at herself and be blunt and real and plain and yet hopelessly sexy all at the same time. How you don't even have to feel bad for her jilted ex because he is incredibly attractive in his own right and will probably end up happy with someone else.

The best element, though, was how these two people who were so assertive in their independence - not in the way self-described independents often look in worse movies, like ""I cannot bring myself to respect any woman, and only use them for woo-hoo!"" or ""A man once hurt me terribly and now I distrust the entire sex!"" (oh dear, how are we going to get THESE two to fall in love?, ugh, etc.), but a little more realistically than that - came to desperately need one another. When they first meet, their interaction is obviously charming, but there's no real cause on either side to pursue it as anything more than a fling. Nick is just bored and overconfident, and I guess Terry feels emancipated and a little on the reckless side, but always smooth and in control. AND YET... next thing you know they're swimming together, and once you've seen each other in a bathing suit you might as well get married. I mean Cary Grant in swim trunks is not just going to skip out of my life.
Even better, when they're off traveling together and visiting sharp-eyed old ladies, they are still not acting foolish or twitterpated or even especially cute. They have my personal favorite type of movie chemistry, which is 90% banter and 10% love-you-anyway knowledge of the other's flaws that occasionally involves confrontation but only of the most loving sort. It seems... I don't know, ""mature."" Maybe just because everyone I know is still in high school.
So yeah, they're deeply in love, but not in that pathetic and obnoxious way where they're weeping in the rain into each other's faces and abandoning all others - rather in a way that makes you feel kind of proud of them. Neither has to debase him or herself for the relationship, neither one becomes pathetic or loses sight of themselves. That's what I hate to see in movies, the sort of reckless hurling of one into their partner because NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. It's unrelateable and always makes me anxious, like, what if they break up?... Ugh. Kerr's character is so much more admirable this way, I mean in that she has a spine, and it MAKES SENSE, because of how her pride (a shortcoming, and her defining characteristic, present at every crucial plot point) actually almost prevents the happy ending that is still within her reach. God that's a scene.

Summary: An excellent movie for when you're feeling unapologetically romantic, or any time you want to feel the heartache without suffering the unhappy ending. Because in the movies, love can even cure paralysis. And Cary Grant wears swim trunks.",1275523200,,4276,4.592931937172775
339869,5,6301586026,"I'm 62 years old; and I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie since I was a girl, but I never tire of seeing it again. I have the Irene Dunn version of ""Love Affair"", as well as the Warren Beatty version of ""Love Affair"" (the latter is not really worth mentioning); but neither holds a candle to Grant/Kerr's ""An Affair to Remember"".
I never knew Cary Grant could act until I saw this movie. I had always thought him rather silly, and I didn't understand why he was considered a romantic lead. But when you see the emotion on his face in the scene at his grandmother's house after her death, and then when you see the pain in his face when he sees the painting hanging in Terry's bedroom, you know that only a good actor could convey those emotions so well. So well, in fact, that I never fail to cry when I see those scenes.
What makes this one of the best all time romantic movies? Nowadays, you can see anything you want in a movie, leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. Well, that's not romance. In ""An Affair to Remember"", you see absolutely nothing, not even a kiss; and somehow that makes it all the more romantic. There is one scene when a kiss is implied: Nicky and Terry are coming down the steps to the lower deck on the ship, they stop, go back up a step where you can't see their heads, stand perfectly still for a minute, and you're left to draw your own conclusion. Now that is more romantic than all the passionate love scenes in all the movies put together. Of course, the beautiful musical score doesn't hurt.
Well, that is one old lady's opinion. Hope someone finds it helpful.

Full disclosure: I'm a sucker for a good, sentimental romance. Love Cary Grant. Love Deborah Kerr.

But this movie is overwhelmingly cheesy -- when it's not overpoweringly saccharine, that is. The script is hackneyed, and the major plot twist is preposterous. Without adding a spoiler here, does the very perceptive and intelligent Terry McKay not know how to use a telephone? or write a letter? If they love one another as profoundly as they both know, then certainly Nickie would not have rejected her, but embraced her unconditionally. The shark jumps even higher when the Treacle Children's Choir shows up. TWICE, just in case their 'cuteness' wasn't hammered home the first time. Awful.

There wasn't one car chase; one shootout; not one time Cary Grant grabbed Deborah Kerr's you-know-what(s).

No sex, no violence, and way too many sex-starved violins.

And Cary Grant posing as a Greek!  (Oh, the humanity!!!)

Still, all the gals who just LOVE this movie.  Did you love the part where, as they past the Empire State Building, Deborah Kerr *curtsies* to Cary Grant?  Eh?  I forget her exact line to Cary but it was something like: ""Your wish is my command.""  ... Now there's a liberated chick for ya!  (Yeah, baby!)

I otherwise like Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant.  (And, God knows, they've never had a harsh word for me.) But this movie is laughable.  A prima facie case of prima facie pretense.  (And half a pound of baloney while you're at it.)  This isn't love, even in La-La Land.

I've seen better making-out at the Junior Prom.  (Greeks and all!)

And talk about manipulating the audience's emotions.  Sheesh.  All Deborah Kerr needed in her wheelchair was a puppy dog, an American flag and a picture of the little baby Jesus.  (That other cocker.)

Also, what about the guy Deborah Kerr was supposed to marry?  She comes home from her cruise and what does she do?  She dumps the bum.  Just like that.  And he (mirabile dictu) -- he just bows out of the picture, no questions asked.  Get outta town!

Go ahead, try it sometime, lady. ... ""Hey, Fred, you know that we were supposed to get married.  Well, guess what -- forget you, Fred!  And the caterer truck you came in on.""

There shold have at least been a decent fistfight between Cary Grant and the jilted fiancee.

Of course this would have meant that Cary would have gotten his nice Brooks Bros. suit all wrinkled.  But so what?  Besides, what the fark is it with Cary Grant and his suits?  In jst about every picture he's in, he's got a suit on.  He sure never takes it off in this flicker.

Enough already with the suit, Archibald.

Mind you, it's not that I'm jealous.  So Cary Grant is handsome.  So what.  Take away his suave manners, his Continetal charm, his feency-schmancy suit, and what do you got? ... A horny guy running around in his underwear looking for the Empire State Building.

(Rim shot!  Ba-da-bing-bing!)

Listen up, pilgrim: anybody who jerked a tear over this facockta movie needs therapy.  Fast!  ""Weep-weep-weep, what can I do, what can I do?  I can't help crying over poor Debbie and poor Cary.""

What can you do?  What can you do?!  YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN!  Look at you crying like a woman.  ""What-can-I-do?-what-can-I-do?""

Listen, you look terrible.  I want all you nutty people who gave this turkey five stars to eat.  And I want you to lock yourselves in your room with a dozen or so Gary Oldman movies, a dozen or so Chuck Norris flicks and a life-size inflatable doll of Freddy Krueger.

Did they really fall in love on the ship? Could have fooled me. Some ""love affair"" to ""remember"". I think I'd have forgotten it the second I left the ship.

The fact remains that the veteran director told the same tale in just 87 minutes back in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1939/dp/B0000A0DTV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1939</a>, and the extra half-hour feels like pure padding in the update. Moreover, the sentimental wash of the love story feels even more contrived on the grander scale of a full-color CinemaScope production. You certainly couldn't ask for stars more luminous than Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr at this point in Hollywood history, but their charms can only go so far in sustaining interest in their characters' burgeoning romance.

The familiar story goes like this. Traveling alone on a transatlantic ocean liner, playboy bon vivant Nickie Ferrante is trying to avoid public glare over his recent engagement to a prominent New York socialite. Onboard, he meets comely nightclub singer Terry McKay, who is also engaged and also traveling alone. The pair strikes sparks quickly, but a combination of guilt and gossipmongers keeps the would-be lovers apart. Things change considerably when they visit Nickie's kindly grandmother at one of the ports-o-call, and Terry sees his more sensitive side under the elderly woman's becalming influence. Needing to attend to their impending marriages, Nickie and Terry vow to reunite on top of the Empire State Building in six months' time. As anyone who has seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>&nbsp;knows, fate intervenes, and their lives take a different route than either expected.

Grant is on cruise control as Nickie, exhibiting his debonair manner with easy assurance. His big moment of revelation in the final scene is the only time Grant shows something deeper in the character than a suave lover and a frustrated artist. As Terry, Kerr stands in the considerable shadow of Irene Dunne, whose natural lan and sparkling wit elevated the original to classic status. Another key difference is that while Dunne exhibited her own impressive singing talents, Kerr's voice is dubbed by Marni Nixon on Terry's two nightclub numbers. Still, Kerr manages to convey enough of her character's sharp sensibilities and romantic vulnerability, and the chemistry with Grant is very much in evidence here. Cathleen Nesbitt plays the Maria Ouspenskaya role of Grandmother Janou with twinkly, wizened charm, the same valedictory role Katharine Hepburn played in Warren Beatty's inferior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1994-remake/dp/B00005RRJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1994 remake</a>. The rest of the supporting cast is purely incidental with special mention going to the avuncular Charles Watts playing an obnoxious passenger who follows the illicit pair without remorse.

The 2008 two-disc 50th Anniversary Edition DVD package seems excessive for anyone but the film's most devout fans. Disc One contains a pristine print of the film along with a perfunctory commentary track from film historian Joseph McBride with additional comments from Nixon, who shares her personal memories of the production. Disc Two has a number of featurettes starting with a pair of retrospective featurettes, one on Kerr, the other on Grant. Just before his death, screenwriter Peter Viertel reminisces about his wife Kerr, while Grant's widow Barbara does the same. The featurette on McCarey is more interesting in that it shows colleagues and film critics contributing their insight to his impressive body of work. Other shorts focus on producer Jerry Wald and the film's cinematography courtesy of Milton R. Krasner. The best extra is an AMC Backstory documentary on the film's production and legacy. Completing the package is vintage newsreel footage as well as a couple of photo galleries. For fans only.",1250553600,7,4291,6.077557755775578

339882,5,6301586026,"With Cary Grant's dapper charm and Deborah Kerr's elegance, one would have to be blind not to fall in love with this film's surface good looks, but what makes `An Affair to Remember' so unforgettable is that it reaches far below that surface to deliver a believable love story that embellishes the star's undeniable charisma.

In a word, `An Affair to Remember' is...memorable.

The film tells of playboy Nickie Ferrante who just so happens to be settling down.  On a cruise he happens to meet Terry McKay, a charming woman who also happens to be settling down.  The two are instantly attracted to one another, but Nickie's reputation has Terry attempting to avoid him.  His charm is too much and before long they are spending a lot of time together, innocently at first, but it doesn't take long for genuine feelings to creep up within both parties.  They try and separate themselves in order to remain true to their significant others, but their desire runs too deep and before the cruise has ended they have fallen in love.  Wanting to be sure that this is the real thing, they decide to separate for six months (giving Nickie the opportunity to actually work for his catch in more ways than one) only to reunite on the Empire State Building.

But will they ever meet again?

The first half of the film is brilliantly fleshed out.  This isn't your average `boy meets girl, falls in love, believe it or not' type story.  The screenwriters (McCarey, Daves & Stewart) worked really hard to make the love affair between Nickie and Terry authentic and believable.  You can see them falling in love, slowly but genuinely.  The second half is not nearly as good as the first, but it is still good (don't think I'm putting it down any).  With the two stars separated it lacks some of the first half's undeniable charm and appeal.

Grant, much like George Clooney, Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio, is often seen for his looks and charm before his acting talent, but here he is a brilliant mixture of elegance and human emotional complexity.  He really understands how to reign in his charming demeanor for the films climax and portray a man scorned by something he doesn't quite understand.  The coldness he demonstrates is without flaw.  Deborah Kerr is marvelous here as well, matching Grant step for step in the films first half and then completely capturing her character's emotional dilemma in the films second half.  Without her dedicated performance the finale would not have worked.

Oozing with sensual lavishness (is it just me or was that off screen kiss on the cruise ship one of the most beautifully captured displays of affection in all of cinematic history), `An Affair to Remember' gets it all right, and then some.  It's charming, witty, alluring and touching; a film that will make you laugh, make you cry and make you fall in love.",1244678400,4,2843,4.737804878048781

The 50th Anniversary of this film will remind us all of the innocent times of yesteryear.  Romantic and cute, the first part played on an ocean liner. Playboy, Nicki Ferrante, meets the woman he is fated to fall in love with, Terry McKay. They meet, discover they like each other and this turns to love. They visit Nicki's grandmother in France, and this scene is the one we remember. An overly romantic day filled with memories of a loved one and the sweet times ahead.

Finally realizing that they love each other, but have other people in their lives, they make a decision. They decide to meet each other at the Empire State Building in 6 months. Nicki needs to find a job, he has never had a full time job to support himself, never mind a wife.  Nicki starts painting and Terry goes back to singing. The day arrives and...

""The hook comes almost exactly at the halfway point, and while that's the thing most people remember about the film, it also marks the start of its downhill slide."" says Peter Harris. Terry has an accident and is transported to the hospital. Nicki waits at the Empire State Building until midnight. Why didn't they communicate? Is this a case of not knowing each other well? And for six months they lived on faith, but at this crucial moment, no one calls the other?  Far fetched, yes.  But we know that true lovers will find each other and, of course, that does occur.

Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are two of the actors of old Hollywood. The romantic and innocent era of love. This is the 50th anniversary of the film, and it comes at a time when romance and innocence are at a low ebb.
Lovely music sung by Vic Damone. Beautiful scenery and an age old love story.

Nickie Ferrante (Grant) is a smooth-talking playboy who has a new girl every night, but his free reign as a bachelor is coming to an end as he's about to marry millionaire Lois Clark. Terry McKay is a nightclub singer in Boston and is in a long-term relationship. Nickie pursues Terry, who at first refuses, but the two fall deeply in love aboard the SS Constitution and try to hide their blossoming romance from curious onlookers and the ship's photographer. Nickie takes Terry to meet his octogenarian grandmother during a shore leave, and Terry is deeply attracted to the peaceful haven overlooking the Mediterranean.

When they arrive in New York, they agree that they'll meet in six months at the top of the Empire State Building; this will give Nickie time to save up money for a wedding, and for Terry to break the news to her fianc. But on their six-month anniversary, fate intervenes and all does not go as planned.

An Affair to Remember is practically a carbon copy of Love Affair, with the addition of Technicolor and the theme song sung by Vic Damone. Grant and Kerr have a crackling energy and sparkling repartee that make them a joy to root for (both actors did their share of ad libbing). Some of the scenes, particularly those of Terry teaching a children's choir, felt like unabashed filler (and some modern viewers find the tap dance scene by the only two African-American kids in the choir to be racially offensive). Bonus features include an audio commentary by film critic Joseph McBride and Marni Nixon, the singing voice of Terry McKay, profiles of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, bios of director McCarey and producer Jerry Wald, a featurette on the look of An Affair to Remember, and a 25-minute AMC backstory of the filming. There's also a poster and stills gallery to peruse. Overall, this is a cute romance, not the best film you'll ever see but one that's had an impact on popular culture for decades, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle-10th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle (10th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Affair/dp/B00005RRJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Affair</a>.",1226793600,,2627,5.856396866840731
339908,5,6301586026,"Well said Lawrence Ryan, ""An Affair to Remember"" is a story that is well worth remembering for all people in every time or place, and thank you, I for one am one of those girls who like to see Real men around, those who are strong enough to wait six months, or longer, for the girl they love, the girl who loved him enough to want to give her whole heart and not just a one night stand, or even a one cruise stand ! The girl who was wonderful enough to give everything or nothing.
My mother loved this story, it was very emotional for her, for she too, like Terry McKay, had been in a horrible accident, leaving her nearly bed ridden the rest of her life. My Mother called herself, Genu, after Nicki's grandmother, she was like her, having to stay within the bounderies of her small world, as Nicki's grandmother called her beautiful home in France, where Nicki introduced her to Terry McKay.
Though mostly bedridden my mother managed to homeschool me, and my brother and sister, and I will always be grateful for what she gave us. My mother is gone now, but she left her children with an understanding of life that will guide us wherever we go, principles that will guide us whatever situation we find ourselves in, and a love of a timeless classic, ""An Affair to Remember."" {note: my Dad stayed by her side, too, till the day she died}!
My comment to a reviewer on the 1994 remake, ""Love Affair"":
Yes, nearly the exact same script, but that isn't good enough, when they start changing main issues, such as the main couple getting in bed together before they get married, is changing everything; wasn't Terry McKay a good girl? And wasn't the whole point of the story that she was able to stand off the playboy so well, and by so doing win his heart?
If you ask me that is the kind of heart to win, one that loves us for ourselves, even without giving him a thrill in bed before he has committed himself to her .
And because of her example he learned something wonderful, that he too was actually strong enough to control the desire for such thrills for a whole six months just to show he was indeed worthy of her!
I don't care if the movie doesn't show such things explicitly, you still are being told what's going on, and is that really what we want our children to learn? Sex without committment?
Committment is the whole theme, and point of, ""An Affair to Remember"".

339961,5,6301586026,"One of the great motion picture romances, ""An Affair to Remember"" stars the legendary Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr as two engaged to be wed people meeting aboard a cruise to New York. The pair soon become acquainted and their friendship blooms into romance.

They agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building six months from then, provided they still feel the same way about each other. However, through a tragic series of events, their romance seems doomed forever.

The film boasts stellar performances from Grant as a lovable playboy finally wishing to settle down with his ideal woman; Kerr is particularly engaging in the second half of the film regarding what has happened to their relationship.

The film glides by seemlessly and without a moment of boredom as the viewer hopes for a happy ending. It is not however, the thought that everything could go wrong for the couple; but rather the way in which this is presented in terms of character, plot and narrative. The final, heartbreaking scene is only effective when taking into consideration the pasts of the two characters and how perfect they seem for each other.

Short answer: a resounding NO!  What they (whoever they are) did was take a movie classic that millions love and that, as Deborah Kerr says,  ""people watch every six months to have a good cry,"" and bury it in blather.

 Here's what's on disc two: 1. A few minutes of  the Widow Grant talking about her love affair with Cary in the most  unrevealing way imaginable.  2. A few minutes of screenwriter Peter Viertel, Kerr's second husband, talking about how their love affair broke up Kerr's first marriage, then inferring that he played around during their 30 years together and she put up with it because ""she was a saint."" 3. Endless minutes of  Peter Bogdanovich and an all male bunch of  academic talking heads blathering on about the life and works of  director Leo McCarey, who also played around and was an alcoholic and  whose suavity was said to be the inspiration for  Cary Grant's screen personna.  4.  Jerry Wald's brother and sons with a  bio of  the  producer.  5. The return of the blathering academics  to dissect the look of the movie. 6. Newsreel clips from the premiere and  TA DA!...7. the only interesting and professional-looking  piece on the entire bonus  disc: an AMC ""Backstory"" feature which you may well have already seen on TV and which dishes some interesting dirt accompanied by decent visuals.

 Having wasted my ears on disc 2 before trying out the commentary track on disc 1, I was admittedly blathered out and it didn't help that the film historian-commentator early on started  getting some plot points wrong.  But what pushed me to the ""off"" button was his anecdote about meeting Cary Grant after Grant's retirement and introducing himself by saying (oh barf) ""I come to you with a message from the women of America: they want you to return to the screen,"" to which good old Cary replied, ""What did you do, take a poll?""

 You'll note that they waited to release the 50th anniversary edition of this 1957 movie until 2008. I suspect the reason is they had to wait for all the principals to be dead (Kerr and Viertel died in the fall of '07) before they could get away with producing a tribute that's  so on-the-cheap and unworthy.

 Ah,  how I would have loved to read Nora Ephron's take on this debacle.

 As the British radio guy says in his sign-off at the beginning of the movie: ""Well....there you have it.""",1200355200,23,2638,4.693654266958425

339994,5,6301586026,"Since Deborah Kerr passed away last week, I feel compelled to write a review of this wonderful motion picture which, after more viewings than I can even count, remains in my top five alltime favorites.  Yes, the movie is corny.  Yes, it's mostly unbelievable.  What two people, so in love as Terry and Nicky, would promise to meet in six months and have absoloutely no contact with each other during the six months?  I like to think of it as a test of their love.  After all, they gained some depth of character while on the ship together.  I like to think that they wanted to see if the changes in themselves would last.  Yes, it's unbelievable that Nicky would not try to find Terry when she didn't show up atop the Empire State Building.  Yes, it's unbelievable that Terry would not tell Nicky why she wasn't there.  But, It's a movie, for goodness sakes.  And movies, at least for me, are about escapism.  They're not about the ""real world.""  They are a place I go to fantasize, to dream, to cry tears of happiness.  This classic love story gives me all of these 'places.' And it gives me so much more.  I only wish that those days were not long gone from the hills of Hollywood.

Deborah kerr was 86 years old when she passed away last week.  But, to me, she will always be Terry McKay who, once upon a time on a cruise ship, fell in love with Nicky Ferrante and who, after going through hell, found her way back into his arms sitting on a couch beside a warm fireplace at Christmas time.",1193270400,22,1493,4.335740072202166

My only complaints are that it may be overly dramatic that Kerr's character wouldn't want to tell Grant what happened to her; equally unreasonable is the motivation for Grant's character not looking for Kerr after she disappears. Love is likened to a perfect, spiritual state of being that is not a choice, and in Real Life, the whole drama could have easily been avoided... but then, why make a movie? From an ideological standpoint, the way disability is portrayed is problematic, what with the overcoming-all-the-odds bit, but it was the 50s. The children's musical interludes also drag a bit. However, the development of both the lead characters is phenomenal due to the exquisite acting and the delivery of intelligent, subtle dialogue. The tone is restrained and the dialogue is flippant and a little blas, but this only serves to clearly convey the emotional truths of the characters - I'm a sucker for this one.",1116460800,4,1116,4.848167539267016

I think it may be its reference in ""Sleepless in Seattle"", another good but overrated film, that has made this one so popular today and even though the 1939 version, ""Love Affair"" (also directed by Leo McCarey)is considerably better, people, in this actor-obsessed age in which we live in, are drawn to this one because it has Cary Grant in it. Unfortunately this version has no soul to it and the two main actors have almost no chemistry between them.  I would find myself nodding off from time to time if it weren't for the nice scenery and excellent story because the actors themselves seem to be sleepwalking through the story.  In fact, even the 1994 version, ""Love Affair"" is better than this.  I do like Cary Grant and I want to like this movie more but I cannot in good conscience rate it any higher than this. I wish people would try out the superior 1939 version instead, but I realize that that is unlikely to happen. I don't want to beat up on this version too much.  Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are still good actors and they do a fine job here.  I just think that it is a mistake for so many to make a bee-line for this one film in the classics section of the video store and pass over so many other great movies.

340090,4,6301586026,"Director, Leo McCarey's remake of his own ""Love Affair"" is a masterful attempt to update a classic for the post war generation.  Yet, regardless of whether you see the original or its remake, this ""An Affair To Remember"", the net result of your cinematic experience is ultimately slated to turn out the same - bring Kleenex!
Cary Grant is Nicky Ferranti, a big time 'dame' hunter who is all set to marry an heiress when he falls, but hard, for Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr), the park avenue play-thing of a wealthy New York financier.  As in the original, McKay and Ferranti discover that love may not be enough to keep their dreams alive, particularly after one of them suffers a tragic accident that alters the course for both their futures.
This is the sort of grand romantic melodramatic canvas on which such broad, yet stirring, brush strokes have been painted,  that one can not help but become emotionally involved.  Yes, there are several musical numbers (a shame since they're neither visually appealing, nor do they advance the story) and yes, the material is heavily dated.  But there must be something to this movie - still a tear jerker forty-five years later.
When Fox Home Video first issued this movie on DVD it was widescreen but not enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  There was a considerable amount of film and digital grit and colors, though dated throughout, seemed excessively garish. There was also some slight edge enhancement and aliasing detected.
I am happy to say that most of these anomolies have been corrected, providing us with a much smoother looking, color consistant transfer that is a marked improvement over the previous DVD.  This one is also anamorphic.
While fine film grain and dirt and scratches in the original print are still present, this time around, they are not obtrusive to the eye.
The soundtrack on this disc is virtually identical to the previously released DVD.  At times it has a nice spread. But this is the very same, dumbed down, Dolby Surround mix that was imported from Fox's original laserdisc, instead of being  rematrixed to a 5.1 track.  All Cinemascope movies were recorded in six track stereo so a revamped soundtrack for this movie should have been considered.
Extras: an all too short documentary on the making of this movie that spends much of its time dishing dirt on Cary Grant, his medicinal use of LSD and thwarted affair with Sophia Loren.  Honestly, did I really need another American icon humiliated in this way?  There are also some stills and a theatrical trailer.  Overall, the extras are disappointing but hey, at roughly twenty dollars a pop - depending on where you buy this movie, I suppose the customer gets what he or she has paid for.

The two musical interludes featuring a singing Terry (Deborah Kerr) and kids were really unnecessary -- did she still think that she was Anna from 'The King And I?'

Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr star as two love-jaded individuals who meet on an ocean liner, each concerned with their own love affairs.

Suffice it to say that one heck of a misunderstanding ensues and many a hard word is passed before The Great Realization of the last scene.
""An Affair to Remember"" is a special movie for many folks; it's not all that special for me, but it's pretty good regardless. One thing that I don't like about it--and you see it in many movies of the period--is that in The Misunderstanding, Grant gets to say a lot of mean things to Kerr. How come we never see one of those Misunderstandings where the woman gets to berate the man for a change? Ever notice how it is always the woman getting castigated? My personal peeve, I guess. It's a true soap opera-type movie where terrible odds are overcome and true love reigns supreme in spite of it all. Watch it with the girlfriends and bond.",1029024000,,1392,4.549800796812749
340098,3,6301586026,"I can't quite figure out why so many people absolutely adore this movie. Perhaps it is simply because I am not a fan of tearjerkers at all - instead of making me cry, they make me just want to turn them off. But, if you are a fan of that type of film, this would be the ultimate film to watch. No other romance can quite equal the charm of this movie, and even though it is not my style of movie, I can recognize that it is the best of its kind.
Essentially, An Affair to Remember is about an irresponsible ladies man (Cary Grant, at his most charming) who meets and falls in love with a beautiful, sincere woman (Deborah Kerr) on a boat. It describes their subsequent romance, complete with many shipboard scenes, the famous Empire State scene, and ""heartbreaking"" events. The last scene is famous for making people cry - although I personally didn't - it is a very emotional scene.
Anyhow, even though as a rule I detest tearjerkers, the fact that I tolerate this movie, and even think it is somewhat good in parts, shows that it is really a good movie for people who enjoy romances/tearjerkers. Mainly, this is because of the fantastic stars, the glamorous and handsome Cary Grant (so talented he makes it all look so easy) and beautiful Deborah Kerr. This movie is also very innocent and has no inappropriate material, unlike some similar movies that are made now. So, I would say that if you enjoy what I consider ""sappy"" romances or tearjerkers, this would surely be the movie for you.

Well ""An Affair to Remember"" is one of those classics that belong to the tragic love affair file....but with a happy ending.
Cary and Deberah Kerr are a perfect combination for this.
Like Charles Boyer and Irene Dunn before them, Grant and Kerr find even more depth with general facial expressions and gestures,  that remind me of Capra-esque qualities in their characters.
The scene where Grant is revisiting the home of his Grandmother who had just passed away...returning to the scene in his mind where Love was new and the sounds he hears of the afternoon when he had much to look foward to.....it's heartbreaking to want to touch something that once housed his affection.....we realise then that Grants love for Kerr is as real to us also.

If you see them both you will notice that one of the most amusing aspects of the later production is that the scenery is a mirror image of the original, right down to the last stairway.  Beyond the scenery and productions, however, the riveting intensity of the performances of Boyer and Dunne sear your heart like very few others movies can.
The grandmother on Madeira in ""Love Affair"" is far more realistic then in an ""Affair to Remember"" and gives a performance so vivid that anyone seeing it will end up hating boat whistles too!
Finally, there's the music which the children sing towards the end of the movie.  In ""Love Affair"", pleasant, albeit somewhat corny, tunes are rendered by ""real"" children.

The newer 1994 version with Waren Beatty & Annette Bening has great chemistry AND breathtaking island views!  I have no idea why this version is the one that gets all the kudos... it must be the <sigh> Cary Grant factor.  If you're going to get this one, get the other two as well.  ;o)",1001635200,5,440,4.45

And when they trot out the ivory-skinned, rosy-cheeked Singing Cherubs you'll have to use all your self-control to keep from laughing out loud, or losing your lunch, depending on your mood.

340127,5,6301586026,"From the beautiful opening song crooned by Vic Damone to the tearful last scene, this movie will have you alternately crying, laughing, and crying again. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are perfection as the two people who meet on a ship and fall in love.  Because they are each engaged to other people, they decide to put their feelings to the test of time.  They agree to meet atop the Empire State Building in six months if they feel the same.  One shows up, one doesn't because of tragic circumstances. When they accidentally meet months later at a ballet, it is awkward, yet the chemistry cannot be denied. A sentimental painting, an art dealer's story of a lady in a wheelchair, and Cary Grant's dramatic opening of a door lead to an ending that requires a full box of tissues but is one of Hollywood's most memorable scenes.  In addition, this movie is enhanced by a delighful choir of orphans, a grandmother with an idyllic villa, and Richard Denning in a superb supporting role.  Traditionally a movie to watch with the one you love on Valentine's Day, this movie is excellent alone, as a duo, or in a large group.  Not just a chick flick, but a movie for everyone who has ever loved or dreamed of being in love.",982368000,179,1217,4.509090909090909
340128,5,6301586026,"I must confess, as an 18 year old guy, you may not take my review seriously. But I must say, this is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. A beautiful story that hits you straight at the deepest pit of your being. I rented the movie after I saw sleepless in seatle (another great movie) and saw the scenes involved, and the context used. It was well worth the effort. The story is beautifully timed, with the pace set perfectly, and the 'viewer story' working perfectly with the 'character version' You see just enough of what 'they' do not to make this movie a beautiful tear jerker, with a wonderful ending. Do yourself a favor. Buy this.",981936000,13,653,4.404958677685951
340129,5,6301586026,"Even in this more cynical age, some two generations after this film was made, I'm not really surprised it's still in print. What we have here is a shipboard romance that both Holland America and Carnival Lines know better than to promise prospective passengers. Cary Grant stars as Nicky Ferrante, a pre-Jet Set playboy on the verge of a marriage of convenience. Deborah Kerr stars as, Terry McKay,  a former lounge singer who's met ""Mr. Right"" in the form of a patron where she used to sing. It's a bit unsubtle the way we know that both upcoming marriages are ""the right thing to do"" very early on. That is, until Nicky and Terry meet on the ship. Grant plays the debonair role we came to expect of him over the years, while Kerr's earnest performance and wholesome beauty remind us that Meryl Streep did not invent character acting. Robert Q Lewis is forgettable in a cameo as a previous-generation Robin Leach type, but Cathleen Nesbitt shines as Grant's subtly-matchmaking French grandmother, a role pleasantly similar to her later role in the '60s TV series ""The Farmer's Daughter"". Neva Patterson is predictable as Grant's too-glamorous fiancee, but Richard Denning is impressive as Kerr's man Ken--a standup guy who may have lost her hand, but he evidently believes in Robert Heinlein's definition of love--when another person's happiness is essential to your own. Especially since he remains in Terry's life as a supportive friend after she was supposed to have met Nicky at the top of the Empire State Building but is hit by a car right in front of the building. So when Terry and Nicky meet by chance for the first time since her accident, Ken begs her to let him tell Nicky what went wrong with their rendezvous. That impresses me every time I see the film. If I lost a girl to another guy, I probably could bring myself to be nice to her, but a gesture like Ken's approaches sainthood. At least with me, this film stands the test of time--I'm nowhere near the romantic I was when I first saw it, but it still does things to me.",978048000,28,2040,4.6353591160221
340130,5,6301586026,"One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, ""An Affair to Remember"" is one of the most enchanting love stories ever put on film. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr star in the film, and the two are an elegant pair: Grant's classy wit and Kerr's stylistic charm were made for each other.
Grant is an amorous playboy aboard a ship heading to Europe. Also on board ship is Kerr, an engaged ex-singer. The two meet accidentally and through a series of events, are smitten after a few days. Torn about their own romantic prospects, they finally decide to break off their respective engagements and meet at the top of the Empire State Building in six months, when he has collected some necessary funds. But fate intervenes and their planned meeting is jeopardized...
A beautiful blend of script, direction, acting, and cinematography, (not to mention a glorious title song) ""An Affair to Remember"" is a very romantic, very lovely film that is great for early morning-watching on Christmas Day with a sweetheart. Buy this one and you'll fall in love with it forever.",975196800,37,1056,4.775956284153006
340131,5,6301586026,"When I was young (less than 10 years old), I have seen this movie twice time in the television. As I remember, it was a great romantic &  classic movie one which has made me want to see it again. Unfortunately, I  could not remember the title name of this movie, but only remember 2-3  scenes (such as the beautiful garden on the hill of the grand mother of the  leading actor, the ocean liner on the sea, and many children around the  leading actress).  I have tried 15 years to find this movie by seeing many  old and classic movies, but they are still not exactly what I want. My  friends, many video shop manager who has much experience of old movie  cannot help me because of too short detail of my memory.
Thanks to  AMAZON.COM's design of powerful searching for what we want to buy.  Last  week I read many short stories of many classical movies of Amazon.com and I  thought that it might be ""An affair to remember"".  Finally, I  bought a dvd disc of this movie to try and found that it is the one that I  have tried hard to find it.  After I saw it again, the conclusion is  ""it really worth my attempt of 15 years for finding it""
Now I  am very happy to have it in my collection. No more question of the name of  the movie I have searched for.",965865600,,1252,4.1375
340132,3,6301586026,"The scene where Grant notices a painting in Kerr's apartment prior to Kerr's classic line: ""If you can paint, I can walk"" is alone worth the price of admission. Although I personally prefer LOVE AFFAIR with Boyer and Dunne (of which this glossy number is a re-make), this version has grander production values and it's filmed in decent colour. My only real pet peeve is Nesbitt's interpretation of Nicki's Grandmother; I simply don't think she's effectively convincing (look at the marvelous Maria Ouspenskaya in the original, and you may get my drift!).",958608000,,554,5.032608695652174

Yes, for women who like  Rita Wilson's character in Sleepless In Seattle who go overboard in weeping  over a movie. Yes, for those who are stuck in finding a date-video. Yes,  for filmbuffs who are into Classics. Stay for witty scenes in the 1st half  - Cary Grant in his element, Deborah Kerr - ever so elegant. Stay for the  drama in the third half.

340145,5,6301586026,"I love ""An Affair to Remember"" for many reasons. Most of all, I rate it right after ""Casablanca"" on my list of favorite films because it too deals honestly and in a heart-felt way about people and what they often wish they felt more often in their lives: simple yet passionate love for another. Nicky Ferrante  and Terry McKay cannot really live without each other - - - now, that is how  people who say that they are in love ought to feel, not the mediocre, middling (practical?) manner that one often sees manifested by couples in the present. Now, Cary  Grant - - - he's definitely ""da man,"" all we blokes out here can only  hope to be so gracious, cool, and yet humbly self-aware as this fellow. I have long watched Cary Grant for clues about personal deportment, appearance, dress, and, more importantly, how to treat those who I meet along the way of my life. Not that Deborah  Kerr is a slouch - - - she is as feminine as I like (i.e., a lady such as the ones Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert, and Audrey Hepburn played in their movies), not  to mention lively, lovely, and strong. ""An Affair to Remember""  has the kind of chemistry that all of our romances should have (if only we  guys could all be like Cary Grant, the world would be a more peaceful, pleasant, and romantic place).",951696000,4,1289,4.409282700421941

340148,4,6301586026,"""An Affair to Remember"" with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr has a lot to offer.  I was skeptical when my wife brought this video home for ""us"" to watch, but I decided to give it an honest try.  Once the  movie got underway, and the character development started to take place, I  became interested.  There was more to Grant than a womanizing cad (thought  it took a while for him to shake that image in the movie), and Kerr came  across as a world-wise, yet innocent (in a sense), former night club  singer.
While they are both committed to other people, Grant and Kerr  meet and fall in love on a ship cruising from Europe to America.
Some  of the dialogue and situations appear to be somewhat contrived, but the  acting and story line development stirs true emotion.
This is probably  not a movie for the bump and grind Monday Night Football crowd, but it is  both watchable and enjoyable.  Maybe I was primed to watch it by seeing  ""Sleepless in Seattle"" recently, a movie that my wife and I both  enjoy.
Anyway, give this movie a chance...it's somewhat dated, but it's  still got something to offer.",949622400,22,1100,4.50253807106599
