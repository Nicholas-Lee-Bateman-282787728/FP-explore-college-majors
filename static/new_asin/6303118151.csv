The Bloopers are not great but pretty good. While still a filler video, it's still a fun tape to watch. I give this tape a 6 out of 10.",1451001600,,279,4.090909090909091

Not saying something by accident instead of something else, but more him just messing up on the telepromter.  The matches stink too.  SKIP!!!!",1329868800,,274,5.136363636363637
