6546426,3,B00M1CFWGC,"Based on the graphic novel of the same name by Dan Schaffer, The Scribbler is a dark journey through the looking glass of a psychotic mind with multiple personalities. Schaffer pens the script for this adaptation, a unique mixture of trippy storytelling and stylish direction by John Suits. The marketing campaign for The Scribbler sells it as a superhero movie, which is a bit misleading. Katie Cassidy (Laurel on Arrow) plays a young woman living in a mysterious halfway house, suffering from multiple personality disorder. One of her personalities is known as the Scribbler, a costumed heroine with superpowers. The Scribbler takes you on a wild, mind-bending ride as this woman deals with an eclectic group of supporting characters.

The Scribbler begins with Suki, played by a virtually unrecognizable Katie Cassidy if you are familiar with the CW's Arrow, recounting her wild tale to a criminal psychologist, Jennifer Silk (Eliza Dushku). This film boasts an impressive cast for an independent production, featuring small roles by Gina Gershon, Michelle Tractenberg, Billy Campbell, Sasha Grey, and others, all in fairly memorable but brief scenes. Gershon walks around in her limited role with a huge snake draped over her body. Suki has been living at Juniper Tower, a halfway home for the mentally ill. She suffers from multiple personality disorder and is undergoing a radical new treatment by Dr. Sinclair (Billy Campbell) to cure her of it. He has invented a machine that ""burns"" through her alters, a term for alternate personalities. She hopes the machine will leave her core personality intact while eliminating the other personalities. Will the cure be worse than the disease? Complicating matters is that residents of Juniper Tower keep showing up dead and it might be Suki's fault. It is not until the end do we learn what is real and what is fantasy, in a narrative that constantly plays with our perceptions.

Suki's only friend happens to be the sole man living in Juniper Tower. Hogan (veteran television actor Garret Dillahunt) is seemingly sleeping with most of the residents in the halfway house. The place has quite a menagerie of strange women, including Cleo (Gina Gershon) with her massive snake and another woman with an aversion to wearing clothes. Did I mention the talking dog with a Cockney accent?

The Scribbler is firmly grounded in dark science fiction despite its pretensions of being superhero entertainment. The story and direction are most reminiscent of David Cronenberg's work, most notably Existenz. Since the characters we meet inside Juniper Tower have mental problems and the central protagonist has multiple personalities, it is hard separating fantasy from reality in The Scribbler's narrative. This is probably for the better, as it keeps interest up for at least the first two acts. The script does attempt some philosophical meanderings about conformity in society and what that means for a fractured mind.

The film does take a strange, almost unpredictable turn in its final act. Suki fully embraces the persona of the Scribbler, her super-powered alter, leading to an epic battle pulled from Hong Kong cinema. I would have had less problem with the hectic finale if the antagonist had been more fully developed, but instead the villain is practically pulled out of a hat, ready to do battle. It is one twist that should have been left on the cutting room floor.

Some cool, innovative ideas happen in The Scribbler. It definitely gets the tone and atmosphere correct for a trippy ride through the mind of a woman with hidden powers. Backward writing plays a pivotal role in the narrative, it is almost imperative to use the pause-button if you want to catch the only way Suki's alter communicates with her. The visuals and production design are remarkably effective in conveying the shifting mental state of Suki. This kind of psychedelic filmmaking often goes astray, losing the plot. The Scribbler does not fall victim to that trend as it stays on a tight track. The performances are decent, especially Katie Cassidy's lead role. Suki could easily have been butchered with all of her complexity as a character. Cassidy breathes life into the tortured woman coping with severe mental problems.

The Scribbler has a weird vibe, almost from its first moments. At times edgy with its violent and sexually provocative content, the R-rated film is not lighthearted superhero fare. It is a hard, dark, twisted fantasy world, crafted with some care by the writer and director. Despite the occasionally suspect VFX, there is enough here to make it a solid recommendation for adventurous viewers.

Several months later, I decided to watch it again and found that it was even better the second time around because of elements and dialog that I did not pick up on the first time around.  Clever dialog, stylish everything, and original story are a few descriptions that come to mind.

6546437,4,B00M1CFWGC,"There are a lot of things to say about The Scribbler. And not all of them are complementary. But before that, I have to say how outstanding Katie Cassidy is in the film. She's virtually unrecognizable, but not because of makeup or anything like that. She manages to do what few actors canbecome someone else entirely from the person we know her as. I was really blown away by her performance and hope she doesn't get trapped in Canadian sci-fi purgatory because of Arrow.

The script falters in not admitting its conceit. You already know the premise of the film, I assume, which is that Suki (Katie Cassidy) suffers with DID and is using a machine called the ""Siamese Burn"" to rid herself of unwanted personalities. This all takes place in a high-rise apartment complex that acts as a half-way house for mentally disturbed women. Some SPOILERS here: Each of the women in the half-way house, excluding Suki, is blatantly one-dimensional. And each time Suki uses the machine to burn out a personality, one of these women dies. It's not hard to connect the dots that the apartment complex is just Suki's mind and each of these cardboard cutout women is a different personality. I assumed that conceit was meant to be built into the world and would be fully revealed to Suki as the movie progressed, but it never really happened. That really harmed the narrative arc, I think. END SPOILERS

The movie was a good effort for a low budget. I wouldn't bump it to the top of your watch list, but it's worth a view when you get the chance if you're interested in seeing Katie Cassidy stretch her acting ability past Laurel from Arrow and/or if you enjoy visually rich films.",1436400000,,1665,4.640677966101695

6546442,4,B00M1CFWGC,"Trying to be as objective as I can and spoiler-free I will say that I had no expectations going into this film. I didn't look up the actors or reviews before. I just saw psychological thriller and let it rip. I was pleasantly surprised to see several familiar cast members and a plot that left me thinking instead of a ""meh"".

While most of the characters are fundamentally flawed, what I took away from this was a thought provoking thriller that asks: What is normal? Are our personalities shaped by our experiences, what we would like the world to see, or a compelling mixture?

Starts off provoking, slows a bit in the middle while developing plot and characters, and finishes up well.

Some sci-fi elements add flare - not a whole lot of action here but I was not disappointed. The ending opens a bit of opportunity for expansion, but there was definitely more room for more character development. I would recommend and watch a sequel.",1425686400,,939,4.644578313253012
6546443,4,B00M1CFWGC,"Here's one for the ""esoteric"" column. Supposedly based on a graphic novel (sorry, never heard of it), this movie plays like an amalgam of superhero metaphysical science-fiction psychological thriller: it's all over the place in both a disjointed irrational yet satisfactory ""all-comes-together"" way. Such an ambitious multifaceted hodge-podge production handled in such a straight-laced non-cynical manner in theory should not work at all, and thus cause the viewer to scrunch-up his/her face in an expression of disbelief & confusion, wondering what the heck they'd just got finished watching... but for some reason, the makers of this film have taken what we should normally expect to be an impossible task and somehow made it something where we could comfortably cast aside our utter disbelief and have us accept everything we'd just saw. However, this is both the movie's curse as well as its blessing, because in the end we are going to be sharply divided into two opposing camps: we'll either praise it for what it managed to accomplish and uphold it to a ""cult"" status, or we'll praise it for what it managed to accomplish but still find it too fantastical and too implausible to give it anything more than just warm kudos in passing and likely never reconsidering it or mentioning it again (I count myself among that ""second"" group of general viewership). No one is likely to be disappointed with this movie, but it would still be best to play it safe with a full initial ""no-obligation"" viewing before deciding to ""commit"" to it by way of making a purchase of ownership.",1424995200,,1579,4.984848484848484
6546444,5,B00M1CFWGC,"The film opens with Suki (Katie Cassidy) being interrogated about murders at Juniper Towers. Suki has Dissociative Identity Disorder, i.e. multiple personalities, one of which is ""The Scribbler"" who writes backwards and doesn't speak. Juniper Towers is a half way house for ""crazy"" people, most of whom jump out of a window. She has an electrical shock machine which eliminates one of her personalities, and when she does someone in the building dies during her blackout.

The film was ""Napoleon Dynamite"" weird with the darkness of ""Sucker Punch."" The characters were memorable and quirky. The dialogue was crisp. There is symbolism such as the goldfish living in a jar being like the imprisonment of being normal. Some of my favorite lines:

""A passenger in my own body.""

""Crazy people don't play by the rules.""

""If I did it, it wasn't me.""

""I can't talk without a pen.""

This is not a film for everybody. Suki questions if she wants to be normal. It is bizarre and dark.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Katie Cassidy- daughter of teen idol David Cassidy, Ashlynn Yennie. Oddly adult film star Sasha Grey keeps her clothes on. Must be some deleted scenes.)",1420934400,2,1170,4.908629441624366

8669670,3,B00M1CFWGC,"PROs
 Strong cast... very strong (more on that in the Comment section).
 Heavily stylized visuals for appealing to both graphic novel and neo-noir moviegoers.

CONs
 Not half as clever as it thinks it is.
 Bad dialogue. I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with The Movie Guy this time: the script is crap. Sooo disappointing that these accomplished actors weren't given better material to work with.

COMMENT:
 It's a bit puzzling why there are only two dozen reviews here for a film released fully two years ago featuring actors from several serials with huge fan bases and even fandoms. Occam's razor suggests this is because The Scribbler just isn't all that great.

 Buffy the Vampire Slayer reunion. The whole reason I found The Scribbler in the first place was to see what Michelle Trachtenberg is up to these days. Low and behold, not only was Buffy's kid sister onscreen as an antagonist, but so was Eliza Dushku (aka Faith, the foil Slayer from Whedon's Buffyverse) as Silk, a criminal psychologist.

Another cult show (although not as popular as Buffy), and another pair: Billy Campbell (aka Jordan Collier), and Garret Dillahunt (aka Matthew Ross). I can see why Garret Dillahunt signed on (who would not want to be in a practically softcore scene with Katie Cassidy? Yes, Katie Cassidy is naked in this movie), but poor Billy Campbell must not have known he was signing up for an anemic flick (I'm sure this film looked good on paper... no pun intended).

  Not to mention, we get Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos) as Detective Moss, Gina Gershon (Showgirls) as Cleo, Richard Riehle (a man with 347 acting credits to his name, and a personal favorite) as Officer O'Reilly (a cop who's encountered one too many donuts), and if all that wasn't enough, Bunny was portrayed by Sasha Grey, former porn star gone legit.

 Somebody thought it would be a good idea to add a patient who walks around nude, just for the hell of it... I'll admit, the gimmick did keep me from falling asleep... but when a flick needs to resort to that, it is reaching.",1459728000,4,2211,5.119777158774373
