8256138,4,B0014OR5NG,"This book is a serious look at the West's philosophy, showing it's weaknesses in that it is quite a limited philosophy. Unlike the alcharinga (Aboriginal philosophy) the West loses perspective because it ignores the bigger understandings that exist in the alcharinga. Sophie's World is a challenging look at the West's philosophy, very interesting and enlightening with arguments on major points of the philosophy in question.",1384819200,,426,5.569230769230769
8256139,3,B0014OR5NG,"It was a gift for a friend, and I'm quite certain that he was happy with this. I could do a better review had it been purchased for myself.",1369094400,,139,3.8275862068965516
8256140,4,B0014OR5NG,"I saw this program on sbs a long time ago, and managed to tape all except the first episode.  I love the whole feel of the movie, the quietness and the surreality of it all; and the beautiful music.  My only complaint is that the movie Amazon has here, has a section missing: and one of my favourite sections!  The movie sequence with the cynics is completely missing, and any other scenes in it's general vicinity are missing also, cutting right to the midsummer's eve party.  I was so disappointed!
Having said that, it's still a wonderful movie.  But I would have liked to have the complete program.
And it would have been nice to have been told it was an abridged version.",1294790400,5,676,4.463414634146342
