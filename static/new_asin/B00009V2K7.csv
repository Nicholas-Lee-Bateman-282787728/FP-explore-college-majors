7993012,4,B00009V2K7,"Unfortunately as great as 3 of the matches were on this show, the undercard was just too weak to give a show a 5 star rating.
Sunday Night Heat ""bonus"":  Val Venis vs Matt Hardy:
Considering they had 5 minutes they told a fairly decent story.  I wish this match has been on the PPV instead of some of the other matches on this undercard.  7/10
Shelton Benjamin vs Ric Flair:
Benjamin has loads of talent and he was in the middle of a good push at the time of this match.  However this was not the best effort by either guy and what should have been a very good opening match ended up being tolerable, nothing more.  6/10
Tajiri vs The Coach:
Coach is an entertaining guy, but he should NOT be in the ring on a freakin PPV.  Way better than expected as Tajiri is excellent but the way it ended with a single punch KO from outside was just dumb.  At least hit the guy with a weapon?!  4/10
Chris Jericho vs Christian and Trish Stratus:
Fantastic match that was a lone brightspot in the show when it took place on the card.  Should have been much closer to the main event.  Despite the length of the feud these guys still put on a unique match compared to previous effort and it told a great story.  Jericho needs a more consistent finisher but the timing was perfect.  8.5/10
Victoria vs Lita (women's title):
Lita showed serious ring rust and the match fell flat.  3/10
Randy Orton vs Mick Foley (IC title):
Orton and Mick did not quite have the chemistry of Foley vs HHH which made Hunter a star (moreso).  The fact that the chemistry wasn't as good and yet Orton still came out a star tells you just how good these guys were that night.  Huge props to Orton who gained everyone's respect by taking some of the insane bumps everyone knew would happen but most people thought Foley would take them all as per usual.  Going in I held a 0% chance of Foley winning due to only signing a short contract but when he dropped that elbow..... I was marking out like a little kid and believed there was a chance that Foley could add the IC title to his career resume, off the charts.  9.9/10 (because 2000 Royal Rumble was just that itsy bitsy tiny bit better)
Hurricane and Rosey vs La Resistance (#1 contender tag-team):
This match has no business being this high on the card.  Not a bad performance but the use of Eugene overshadowed the match completely and made it a total waste.  6/10 before Eugene and 3/10 after.
Edge vs Kane:
Everyone in the building knew waaaaaaay before this match who was going to win.  Nobody took Kane seriously and it hurt the match cause the crowd was totally dead despite the return of the Canadian on a show in Canada.  Edge got the big pop at the end but the match itself was also nowhere near what either guy is capable of.  Edge was rusty and Kane looked worse but it was still better than some of the matches and even when rusty, Edge was still able to pull out a 6/10 from me.
Benoit vs HHH vs Shawn Michaels (World Title):
Not quite at the level of WMXX but how could it have been?  You can't possibly re-create the energy of Wrestlemania and Benoit winning his first WWE World Title.  Fortunately it was not that far off.  Plenty of momentum changes and excellent high spots.  All 3 of these guys were performing near the top of their abilities and the match flowed very well.  The way that the screwjob finished was teased was absolutely perfect and the end result could not have possibly been any better.  In the theatre I originally watched this in I even caught myself saying ""thanks Shawn"" out loud and anyone who has been a Canadian wrestling fan since before Survivor Series 97 knows exactly what I'm talking about.  10/10
Getting Benoit's speech in Calgary the next night as part of the DVD was also a very nice touch.  You can see all the Flames jerseys as that night was game 7 against Vancouver and the Saddledome was very close to the HUGE party that took place very shortly after the WWE Raw was over when the Flames won :D  Ok, enough side tracking, bottom line is this was not a very balanced PPV but the good was so good that the bad didn't seem to matter so much. A good buy for a collection for sure!",1092182400,,4150,4.322997416020672
7993013,5,B00009V2K7,I live about 15 mins out of Edmonton and I went to this PPV I loved it live and love it just as much on VHS/DVD. This PPV is simply in the top 10 all time Pay Per Views. With a Wrestkemaina main even rematch for the world title. Which includes Hometown Chris Benoit vs Shawn Michales vs The Game Triple H. And also to my mind the best no holds barred Intercontinetal title match ever. Which had Living Leged/ Legend Killer Randy Orton fight WWE hall of famer Mick FOley as Cactus Jack. This match was barberic and I am sure you will love this PPV as much as I did.,1090800000,,564,4.044642857142857
