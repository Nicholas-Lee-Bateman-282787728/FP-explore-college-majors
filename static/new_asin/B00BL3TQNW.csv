8570176,5,B00BL3TQNW,"A classic. Zita johann, star of ""The Mummy"" w/Boris Karloff in 1931 had that indefinable star quality. She's been forgotten by most but deserves lasting film recognition.",1495411200,,170,5.333333333333333

8570178,1,B00BL3TQNW,"Lets put it this way: Zita Johan is built NOTHING like the artwork on the cover, OK ?",1440892800,3,85,3.7777777777777777
8570179,3,B00BL3TQNW,"I bought this for its curiosity value and am satisfied with the purchase. The picture is a low-budget effort but more to the point its makers were not very experienced, so the writing and direction are amateurish. The cast is good, but they can only do so much with the material. What makes it worth seeing is that it is intended to arouse prurient interest, to be luridly sensational, and fit succeeds.",1434067200,6,403,4.611111111111111

8570181,4,B00BL3TQNW,Pre-code (Hayes) plot that includes adultery and murder combined with well done special effects we take for granted today.  Worth a look.,1362268800,8,137,5.2272727272727275
