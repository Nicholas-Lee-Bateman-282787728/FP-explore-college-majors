5968246,5,B00F6EJHH2,"Simon & Garfunkel: The Concert In Central Park. COLUMBIA/Sony Music DVD Video 88883796669.
I really like this 1981 concert album by Simon & Garfunkel in Central Park, New York City, even though there are not any extras on the DVD, just the concert itself. I prefer to play it using the VLC media player program, as it allows me to take snapshots of the concert as the concert proceeds. Trying to get a snapshot of Paul Simon smiling, is a real challenge, but I keep trying to get a photo of both singers smiling at the same time.  The twenty-two songs on the album,  are mostly a best-of collection of their greatest hits.  It took some doing, but at allmusic.com,  I managed to get ahold of a list of the band members in that concert, as they were not listed on either the non-existent liner notes, or on the album cover.  It sometimes seems like a lost cause, but I feel that the backup band members contribute a lot to any album, and that they should also get liner and cover credits for doing so. The band members are, in alphabetical order:

David Brown, Guitar.
Pete Carr, Guitar.
John Eckert, Trumpet.
Art Garfunkel,  Arranger, Producer, Vocals.
John Gatchell, Trumpet.
Anthony Jackson, Bass.
Rob Mounsey, Synthesizer.
Gerry Niewood, Saxophone.
Simon & Garfunkel,  Primary Artist.
Paul Simon, Arranger, Composer, Guitar, Producer, Vocals.
Grady Tate, Drums.
Richard Tee, Keyboards.
David Tofani, Saxophone.

The songs on the album are: 1.) Mrs. Robinson.  2.) Homeward Bound.  3.) America.  4.) Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard.  5.) Scarborough Fair.  6.) April Come She Will.  7.) Wake Up Little Susie.  8.) Still Crazy After All These Years.  9.) American Tune.  10.) Late In The Evening.  11.) Slip Slidin' Away.  12.) A Heart In New York.  13.) The Late Great Johnny Ace.  14. Kodachrome/Maybelline.  15.) Bridge Over Troubled Water.  16.) 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover.  17.) The Boxer.  18.) Old Friends.  19.) Bookends.  20.) The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy).  21.) The Sound of Silence.  22.) Late In The Evening.

I gave this album five Amazon stars for the performances and the recording quality of the DVD. Now, if they could only add some extras, some liner notes, and band member credits, it would be perfect.

5968247,1,B00F6EJHH2,"I ordered this DVD to replace a VHS recording I have of this wonderful concert.  The product detail at the Amazon site stated this disc to be multiple format, import, NTSC.  NTSC is the format that is compatible with American DVD players.  But the dvd would not play for me.  I noticed the letters PAL on the DVD case and looked it up online. PAL means the dvd can be played in Europe and a few other countries.  When I attempted to return it for replacement, I was not able to because it was 4 days past the limited return period.

Let me get the negatives out of the way first.  1) This DVD would not play in my DVD player.  It did play in my laptop, though, so that was fine with me.  2) There were spots where the sound was just enough out of sync to be annoying and spots where the video quality is not very good.  That's the reason for four stars instead of five.  Its hard to tell if the fault lies with the general production of the concert or if this is just a sub-par transfer.  The sync and video quality were okay during close-ups of Simon and Garfunkel so I put up with less-than-ideal quality during other parts of the video.

Now the positives.  This is one brilliant concert!  I had surprisingly not seen the whole video prior to today.  I had only caught a glimpse of it on HBO a couple of years ago.  I remember what a big deal this concert was in 1981.  Simon and Garfunkel had parted ways and no one thought they would reunite.  I think you can feel some residual tension between them during the concert but there are moments where you can see that these two gifted musicians share a pretty magical bond.  Their voices were in fine form and their harmonies are near-angelic.  I was moved to tears on more than one occasion as they sang some of my favorites.  They really are an amazing duo.  Take one look at this video and youll see what I mean in case you don't already know that.  Its wonderful that this was captured on film for posterity.  If you're a fan on theirs, I highly recommend this DVD.",1510099200,,1538,4.270833333333333
