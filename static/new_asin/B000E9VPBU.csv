8107953,3,B000E9VPBU,"An anachronistic, over-the-top live action cartoon. The film has a constant, silly tone that may irritate some, and others may find very charming. All the actors ham it up, Sam Raimi rips off classic Looney Tunes moments left and right, and the sets and costumes (seeming to run the gamut from the 20's, through the 50's, but anchored in the 80's) create a surreal feel. An interesting, different comedy",1260835200,2,403,4.855072463768116
8107954,1,B000E9VPBU,"There's a chance the nonstop idiocy of Crimewave might appeal to the lowest of lowbrow sensibilities. Sure, stylistically there's probably nothing else quite like it, but why would there be? For most who would choose to engage their cerebra, this piece of nearly incomprehensible cartoony trash is clearly a product of gung ho mis-inspiration on the part of Raimi and the Coen Brothers fed by too much available talent and money...and possibly chemicals.

That this was shot in my hometown of Detroit compelled me to watch to the bitter end; at least I got to see the Belle Isle Bridge.",1248393600,,586,4.86
