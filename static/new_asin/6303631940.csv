690640,1,6303631940,"Episodes like these are what make Doctor Who about as embarrassing to watch as ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"". Which is a pity because Sylvester McCoy turned out to be an excellent Doctor in his following season. And the customer who said Mel was better than Peri needs to get their head examined. This is probably, if not, the worst first episode for a Doctor beating out ""The Twin Dilemma"" by a country mile. The Rani has hijacked the TARDIS causing the Doctor to regenerate (apparently he bumps his head during the fall) and mistakes the Rani for his companion Mel. How I'm not sure. ... Rani's plan is to use the Doctor's genius in this giant brain she's constructed with all the genius's throughout time and space to rule the galaxy. Again, it's better not to ask. But if you are wanting to check out Sylvester McCoy's episodes for the first time, I recommend ""Greatest Show in the Galaxy"", ""Happiness Patrol"", ""Battlefield"", ""Ghostlight"" or ""Survival"".

690641,4,6303631940,"As Mr. Pilato wrote in his review, ""Time and the Rani"" might be one of the most underrated Who stories. Certainly, this adventure is no ""Spearhead From Space"" or ""Castrovalva"", but compared  to ""The Twin Dilemma"", it's a masterpiece! What's great about  this story, is that it jumps into the teeth of the storm. It doesn't give  us any explanation about the Sixth Doctor's injuries leading to his  regeneration. But when has a Who story been forthcoming about certain  elements of the a story? Romana's regeneration comes to mind. But it's  Sylvester McCoy's portrayal of the Time Lord in a state of confusion and  Kate O'Mara's impersonation of Mel that really help the flow of the plot.  Even Mel, although some may not agree, is very good in this one, Pip and  Jane Baker, being the only writers to give her anything decent to say. The  Tetraps are also the fastest moving aliens in the JNT era, they are  realised VERY well. And why do fans and critics have a problem with the  Lakertyians? Great make up! Some wonderfully overblown dialogue, great  design, impressive special effects, and incredibly different and innovative  soundtrack by Keff McCulloch! McCoy's misquotes throughout the story is a  nice touch. Love the ending....""I'll grow on you, Mel!""",960854400,4,1261,4.909952606635071

690643,1,6303631940,"As with the sadly under-rated Colin Baker era, there are a lot of people who tend to base their views of the McCoy era on his incarnation of the Doctor's first story.
From its ridiculous, uninventive name onwards, this  story is a case of style over substance.  True, there is the odd dodgy  special effect - those fake-looking facial scales for example - but most of  the effects on display here are visually very impressive.
But the plot is  a nonevent, one long runaround filled with captures, escapes, re-captures  and other examples of economical storytelling.  The Rani's plan is just  complete gibberish (and if she's so super-intelligent why doesn't it dawn  on her to build a rocket with an adjustable trajectory?), the Teraps are  wasted, Mel is irritating in her every scene and the music is just dire.  No onder the raings went downwards from here onwards - as far as the public  were concerned the series had apparently become a cosily bland pantomime  and they gave up on it.  Even the much-hated 'Horns of Nimon' was far  better than this.
If you want to see McCoy's Doctor in action then you'd  be better off watching 'Curse of Fenric', 'Ghost Light' or 'Remembrance of  the Daleks' which are all-time classics.",955065600,2,1227,4.766666666666667
690644,4,6303631940,"I an just shocked at most of the reviews from so called fans of the program. This happens to be one  of the most exciting regeneration stories ever! If you take account of what happened, the production team did a very  good job. The execution, the OTT acting and dialogue, and design  is  wonderful. McCoy is wonderfully looney. Keff McCulloch's soundtrack is  unlike anything to be heard on Doctor Who. Shame on all Who fans who can't  enjoy it!",951609600,4,446,4.582278481012659
690645,3,6303631940,"Well. I don't want to write too much here, though I often do... um... anyway... I just want to say that I do appreciate the swell of frustration with McCoy's first season and its severely orginal and comic bent.  However, I say (!)NEVER(!) has a Dr. Who story been so misguidedly  underrated than this one by fans, if you ask me.
Clearly, it is silly in  its way... withdrawing enormous dramatic potentials from a regeneration  story -- always a high-dramatic-potential situation in Dr. Who.  Colin's  departure from the series was most tragicly timed and handled,  surely.
However, so much looked-over good is here in the shadows of the  comic and wacky Pip-'n'-Jane-ity nonsense.  What I like here, anyway, is  the freshness of this production.  I had never seen anything like it until  it came along.  The effects and makeup are really better than practically  anything seen before on Doctor Who (and I believe that anyone that says  otherwise is really saying so only because they want to hate this  difference -- this weird new show -- along with the rest of the  unrestfuls... who I'm not better than...).  The fun of it all (instead of  the twisted mania of the C. Baker Era) -- the zaniness of ""first""  McCoy (I also love ""more hasta less vista""!) -- Mel's nutty  apparel and the Rani's impression of her -- is really a charmingly  appropriate element in this setting.  And pretty much everything about this  setting is uniformly well-mixed and handled, actually -- from the Rani's  manic over-the-top-ness to the Tetraps' goofiness-and-horror-at-once.
Fun  is rarely as appreciated as it should be in Doctor Who fandom -- especially  by the most serious fans.  ""Time and the Rani"" is no  masterpiecely marvel, but it is easily enjoyable on the level of, say,  (another zany underrated charmer) ""The Horns of Nimon"" or (a true  classic in Dr. Who fun) ""The Romans"".  For that matter, I must  say that not all ""fun"" Doctor Who stories are all that defensible  (e.g. ""Delta and the Bannermen"" later this same season).
But  still, folks.  You simply have to be easier on the  ""debut  stories"" of our various Doctors.  They are, all of them, bound to be  VERY different from what comes immediately before and what comes  immediately after -- the show is still learning how to handle the change.  Their inadequacies must be forgiven a bit more readily than other stories'  inadequacies.  This new McCoy-Doctor does indeed extend into the rest of  his era -- he is not completely reborn at any time later on.  (From here  straight on until Lungbarrow in the NAs Books or, if you like,  ""Survival"" at the end of season twent-six, he is, clearly, the  same man.) And the freshness of it all is really what should be judged, if  you ask  me -- and the consideration of just how well the new Doctor is  introduced there -- alon with, as always, how well the story is told.
My  last little sermon:  The only ""debut story"" that deserves high  criticism and ridicule for its mishandling is ""Enemy Within"", the  1996 TV movie.  Now THAT didn't feel like Doctor Who (a complaint about the  also underrated ""The Twin Dilemma"" and ""Time and the  Rani"").  I suppose that's another discussion, though.
[BTW, if I  could, I'd give this one three and a half stars out of five instead of  three... but I do think it deserves placing closer to three than to four.]",933552000,6,3349,4.708333333333333

690793,2,6303631940,"""Doctor Who"" was a British television show that was produced from 1963 to 1989. While ""Doctor Who"" was specifically developed for children, folks of all ages have been enjoying the show for more than 50 years (i.e., it was a ""family show""). The title character (The Doctor) is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who can travel through all space and time in his TARDIS (which, due to a broken chameleon circuit, is stuck in the form of a blue police box).

During the show's 26 seasons, there were seven different actors who played The Doctor. I have seen every episode for the third (Jon Pertwee), fourth (Tom Baker), fifth (Peter Davison), sixth (Colin Baker), and seventh (Sylvester McCoy) Doctors. I have seen most of the available episodes for the first (William Hartnell) and second (Patrick Troughton) Doctors (many of the episodes are not available because the BBC reused the video tapes on which they were recorded).

I recently watched all of the ""Doctor Who"" episodes featuring Sylvester McCoy (the seventh Doctor) in order. Overall, these episodes are bad. As Verity Lambert (the first producer of ""Doctor Who,"" from 1963 to 1965) said, ""You've got to be able to suspend your disbelief, and with Sylvester McCoy it got so camp. It was ridiculous, and I think that's why people stopped watching it."" Most folks hated seeing The Doctor over-acting, behaving like a clown, and rolling his Rs (e.g., ""Rrrrrrrrrrobot""). Sylvester McCoy was not responsible for the poor quality of the ""Doctor Who"" shows during his years; producer John Nathan-Turn (J N-T) and script editor Andrew Cartmel were entirely to blame for the horrible shows made during the McCoy years.

Time and the Rani is the first episode of Season 24 from 1987. This episode is important because it features the first appearance of the seventh Doctor, played by Sylvester McCoy. Of the 159 stories in the original Doctor Who series, I would say that ""Time and the Rani"" is among the 20 worst. The ""Mighty 200 Poll"" conducted by Doctor Who Magazine (which rated 200 episodes from the old and new Doctor Who shows) rated ""Time and the Rani"" 198 out of 200 (third from the bottom). The same poll rated Sylvester McCoy as the second worst Doctor (with, of course, Colin Baker being the worst).

In ""Time and the Rani,"" The Rani (an evil renegade Time Lord whom we met in ""Mark of the Rani"") causes the TARDIS to crash-land on the planet Lakertya. At the very beginning of the story, the Doctor ""regenerates"" into his new form (Sylvester McCoy). Very shortly, we learn that The Rani has kidnapped the Doctor to repair equipment she needs for some evil plan. As is customary following a Time Lord's regeneration, the Doctor is very disoriented and confused and not quite himself (neither his old self nor his new self).

Pros:
- Excellent video quality.
- The original story by Pip and Jane Baker is pretty good, although it has way, way too much ""filler."" Pip and Jane Baker also wrote ""Mark of the Rani"" which was shown in Season 22. Unfortunately, their original story was vitiated by changes mandated by the new story editor, the producer, and a BBC exec.
- Good first-time use of digital special effects.
- Good supporting cast.
- Interesting costumes and makeup.
- Good outdoor scenes (which were notoriously difficult to shoot).
- Witty dialog here and there.

Cons:
- Criminally bad portrayal of The Doctor by Sylvester McCoy. Mr. McCoy plays The Doctor as a buffoon. While the Doctor had sometimes been whimsical and funny (as with the Patrick Troughton's second Doctor and Top Baker's fourth Doctor), he had never before been portrayed as a clown. This ruined the series for me. When The Doctor played the spoons (including Kate O'Mara's breasts as a percussive surface) I knew that the show was doomed.
- The Doctor's companion, Mel (Melanie Bush, played by Bonnie Langford), is dreadful. Before producer John Nathan-Turner, Doctor Who had some truly great companions; after J N-T took control of ""Doctor Who,"" he originated the most annoying and hated companions in the series. For example, compare Mel to Leela (a companion of the fourth Doctor): when confronted with a monster, Mel (like Peri before her) screams and screams and screams and screams; in contrast, Leela might turn to the Doctor and (with a gleam in her eye) says, ""Doctor, we must make weapons and kill the beast!!!"" In fact, Leela might just pull her knife and plunge it into the heart of the monster without saying a word.
- The portrayal of The Rani was not as good as it was in ""Mark of the Rani.""
- Horrible background music.
- The question-marks on The Doctor's costume. This was an idiotic idea of producer John Nathan-Turner, started in the last season of the fourth doctor. J N-T is also responsible for dressing the sixth Doctor, Colin Baker, in that ridiculous clown suit.

In summary, you should skip this story until you have seen the episodes for Doctors 1 through 5. With a few exceptions, the Sylvester McCoy years were rather bad in comparison. Even so, I am glad I got this DVD because I liked the Special Features.",1415923200,,5081,4.7867730900798175

It was great to see the Rani impersonate Mel (pretty funny actually) but the story made little sense and the bat creatures were just silly (although they did scare my 2 year old).

690883,1,6303631940,"There are so many things that don't work with this serial.  I can't imagine what people thought watching this for the first time.  After a couple spotty years of C Baker I'd imagine that there were people really looking forward to the change.  But, as much as I wasn't a huge fan of the previous seasons, I honestly can't say anything redeeming about this change.

Mel wasn't bad in Terror of the Vervoids (better than Peri on her good days), and while she was a bit of a wall flower in The Ultimate Foe, she's the through-line from the last season. So, you think that we'd get to see her interaction with the new Doctor.  Nope.  Instead, they are split up at the beginning, and all she does is run around and scream and scream and scream (so much for having a the personality that she was gifted in The Vervoids).  She's preaches to anyone that listens about The Doctor's ""humanity"", but we don't really ever see that she knows The Doctor other than the video of what might happen between the two of them in the future in Trial of the Timelord.

The Rani was something of an intriguing character in The Mark of the Rani, and it is a bit of a shame that she ended up taking the back seat to The Master.  I was looking forward to seeing her character shine, but here she is just too OTT, with nothing interesting to her character.  Her only personality trait is that she is evil (oh, I guess she is also conniving).

McCoy is hamming it up.  He doesn't really know what his Doctor is supposed to be like yet, and clearly the writers don't either.  That is the least offense, but it exposes how flimsy his relationship is with Mel, and showcases how terrible The Rani is overacting.

Watching any interaction between the three of them is like watching a bad high school play (and I do later like McCoy as the Doctor, but it takes a while).

On top of that we are bombarded by the garish costume design for the Lakyrtians, and the rubber suited Tetraps while having to muscle through the cloying synth soundrack pasted on top of every scene.

Everything looks cheap, and feels cheap.  It is a good indicator of the bad things to come.",1313971200,7,2131,4.3816793893129775

It, like all of McCoy's first season, also commits the cardinal sin of being both excruciating and boring. Don't give up on McCoy though. Check out some of his stories from later in his run like Remembrance of  the Daleks and  Curse of Fenric.",1309046400,,545,4.869565217391305
690886,5,6303631940,"I admit...I like the first season of McCoy...for several reasons.  These stories were written with Colin Baker in mind. I am in the minority in this, but I do like Mel, screaming and all; she's much better than that miserable little character that follows her.  They hadn't started tampering with the Doctor's background yet. That happens the following season. Finally, the left-wing writing that dominates the next two seasons is not evident during McCoy's first year.

In fact, Time And The Rani is quite the opposite. It slaps Marxism and Socialism in the face. Case in point, the Lakertyans represent a race that has become indolent, with all their needs fulfilled, everything handed to them, causing them to lose their will to strive, therefore losing their ability to survive.  Using this laziness against them, The Rani steps in to subjugate the planet, using them to do her bidding. It's a stern message. Don't depend on government handouts or you will become slaves.

Time And The Rani is quite an enjoyable romp. I really don't understand fandom's negativity towards it. It has many similarities to the previous Doctor's debut story, The Twin Dilemma, another story I enjoy. The Rani (Mestor) subjugates a planet, Laketya (Jaconda) with the help of a collaborator, Beyus (Edgeworth), enslaving the people to assist in causing a cosmic phenomenon which as a side-effect will destroy the planet for the intended effect of being able to take over the universe.  If only they would have continued this path for McCoy, the series may never have been cancelled two years down the road.",1308441600,3,1589,5.0
690887,3,6303631940,"Let's be honest. Colin Baker was NOT bad. He was not a bad actor, or a bad Doctor. Sure, he was uppity, arrogant, boisterous, loud, and a little rude, but I found that to be a very interesting way to portray the character. As much as I love Peter Davison, Colin Baker was a pleasant change. And really, he wasn't as bad as people claimed he was (minus the choking scene in Twin Dilemma). He genuinely loved Peri, and you could tell. His tenure was a bit more violent, but they were trying to make it a bit more adult by putting the show back on Saturdays and with new 45 minute episodes. We got some classics in the form of Vengeance on Varos and Revelation of the Daleks, and some blunders in the form of Timelash and Attack of the Cybermen (which wasn't too bad, just not great). And people complained. The violence was too much. Those 7 million faithful viewers were letdown and so was Colin Baker. His next season sucked. And he got sacked.

Enter Time and the Rani, the beginning of the McCoy era. Where to begin? Yes, it is a very, very, very hated story (not so much as Twin Dilemma, but still). The story is goofy, Kate O'Mara is starring in a panto, and McCoy is literally clowning around, rolling his rrrrr's and acting like a child's street performer. And yet, there's a little bit of pity that goes into this. The writers didn't know Colin wouldn't be coming back, and so they did their best to reincorporate new elements into the script. On the DVD, the writers even mention a request to make the script funnier, and that they could write comedy and they could write drama, but they couldn't do both in the same script. And it shows. The story is a mess. It doesn't really make since, and it drags on a lot. I hate the Tetraps, they're annoying and not well designed in my opinion. They don't scare anyone and they're goofy. And what's the point of 4 eyes if you don't ever use them? They snuck past them so many damn times. Are those eyes just for show?

The Lakertyans, the natives to the planet or generic quarry as I see it, look well enough. Their make up doesn't come off and some thought seems to be put into them and they genuinely feel alien (although they look ridiculous running with their hands jammed straight down). Faroon and Beyus are good characters and their actors are fantastic. Ikona is a bit annoying but he does the part well I suppose.

The special effects are good though, and as dumb as this sounds, the bubble traps look cool. The sets don't look too bad, although the Center of Leisure was a bit of an undercooked idea and just reminded me of the Leisure Hive. Mel is okay in this episode. She does scream a load though, and is a bit useless, but that's alright. She could've been a good companion had they have just done more with her. Bit of a wasted opportunity. McCoy stumbles to find a good medium in a not-so-great script and the classic sayings screw ups is annoying. Thank God that was dropped.

So why buy this disc? The extras! And what a good load they give you here. I guess this is pure compensation. You get a great commentary where Bonnie Langford and Sylvester McCoy are fun to listen to, but Pip and Jane Baker (the writers) can be a bit of a bore. There's a fascinating documentary explaining the rough beginning of the McCoy era and the sacking of Colin Baker with a few interviews from JN-T himself and Sylvester McCoy's audition with Janet Fielding. One feature talks about how Lakertya was planned to be a forest and one about Kate O'Mara's experience with her co-stars. There's a feature on visual effects and a look at the creation of the first CGI title sequence, an on location look and a small Blue Peter segment. Wrapping up the extras is an 8-minute photo gallery, production notes subtitles, radio times listings, and remastered picture and sound.

So, if you were going to buy this, the extras make it worth your money. And the story is probably fun to watch... if your not quite sane at the moment, give or take a little tipsy. As much as people hate it, it is a definite turning point in the series. Luckily, the McCoy era would see much, much better days to come and a return to the show's former glory.",1308182400,5,4178,4.4067357512953365
690888,5,6303631940,"I wasn't to impressed with ""The Mark of the Rani"", but ""Time and the Rani"" is an excellent Dr. Who story. This is by far the best one out of Season 24, which is considered by most people, me included, to be one of Doctor Who's worst seasons. The special effects are pretty good for the most part (I really loved the spinning death globes), the story is exciting and action-packed, performances are great, Sylvester McCoy makes a great Doctor - a great change from Colin Baker's, and even Bonnie Langford as Mel is better in this one than she was in her other stories. And considering that they only had one actor to do the regeneration scene, I thought it was quite effective. Although it still would have been better if they had Colin Baker to do the scene with. Over all, I thought this made a great and exciting Dr. Who adventure.

Highly recommended!",1304380800,,854,4.4743589743589745
690919,3,6303631940,"A weak first episode for Sylvester Mcoy's run as the 7th Doctor. Due to the bad blood between Colin Baker and the BBC,  this story begins with a quick regeneration instead of a more dignified exit for the 6th actor (Although Colin has a solid list of audio adventures to this very day many stronger than his last season). So 'Time & the Rani' opens with Mcoy prone and be-wigged for the regeneration sequence which is the worst in the show's 40+ history! Apparently the Doctor is regenerating due to a forced landing caused by the Rani, perhaps, making a return appearance without having to split screen time with the Master ( shame that, cuz the verbal sparing between the two in 'Mark of the Rani' made that weak story stronger). Anyway the pilot to mess with Time and Strange Matter unfolds, companion Mel is confused and there are cameos my Einstein and H.G. Wells helps out, too. The New theme and heavily Digital FX are a distraction, but there's a good Doctor portrayal fighting to emerge here... Did I mention the Chicken People?!

Violently wrenched out of time, the TARDIS is brought crashing down onto the planet Lakertya by the villainous Rani. Caught within the maelstrom, the Doctor is forced to regenerate. Imprisoning the Doctor in her stronghold, the Rani seizes upon his vulnerable state. By impersonating his friend Mel, the Rani deceives the unwitting Doctor into helping her achieve her audacious plan. Just what is she up to? Why has she enslaved Albert Einstein and a host of geniuses? And as an asteroid composed of Strange Matter approaches Lakertya, can a weakened Doctor save the universe when he has little idea of who he really is?

690921,5,6303631940,"I wasn't to impressed with ""The Mark of the Rani"", but ""Time and the Rani"" is an excellent Dr. Who story. This is by far the best one out of Season 24, which is considered by most people, me included, to be one of Doctor Who's worst seasons. The special effects are pretty good for the most part (I really loved the spinning death globes), the story is exciting and action-packed, performances are great, Sylvester McCoy makes a great Doctor - a great change from Colin Baker's, and even Bonnie Langford as Mel is better in this one than she was in her other stories. And considering that they only had one actor to do the regeneration scene, I thought it was quite effective. Although it still would have been better if they had Colin Baker to do the scene with. Over all, I thought this made a great and exciting Dr. Who adventure.

Highly recommended!",1294272000,,854,4.4743589743589745
690922,1,6303631940,"Bad decisions by the BBC, further bad producing by JNT and bad writing make this perhaps the worst first episode ever for any emerging Doctor. If you are a completist, you'll have to get it and I'm sure there must be some saving grace in the episode, though none comes to mind except maybe Syl McCoy should be given some pity for having to put up with a horrible, horrible first season. He's the only one I don't blame for this science fiction abortion. If I could give this story a negative 3 I would. Could be worse though. It could be Dragonfire.",1286841600,2,549,4.339805825242719
690923,1,6303631940,"Strange title, but that is what I thought when I saw Time and the Rani. Mary Whitehouse and the BBC had been forever whinging and whining about Doctor Who, what with Whitehouse's comments about the show being ""too violent"" for ""kids"" and constantly trying to get it toned down (honestly, who did she think it was being made for? Three year olds? What did she think this was? Sesame Street? Play School?), this season-opener (and indeed, the rest of McCoy's first season) must have been a dream come true for her.

Because that is what it feels like. With most of this season, for the first time, I'm feeling like I'm watching a children's show. And a horribly made children's show at that. Time and the Rani brought on the Dark Ages of Doctor Who (yes, Time and the Rani. Trial was for the most part an intriguing mystery season). From the moment of the ridiculous opening where we see the monster turning over the ""Sixth Doctor"" (and you can tell it's not Baker, that costume is wayyyyyy too big on the person) and we're forced to endure McCoy in a blonde wig (Why couldn't you just have him lying on the floor in Baker's costume, having regenerated unseen?) I cringe in embarrassment, and wonder what it was I liked about the show again.

The Rani? Oh, no, far from the intelligent and rational scientist in her first outing, doing what she merely wants to do. Oh, no, now she's a meglomaniac, another imitation of the Master. Arrgh, was it so hard to think of a storyline to better suit the character? The Mel disguise is probably the only thing worth remembering... simply for the ""so bad it's good"" factor, and O'Mara relishing the scene.

Oh, and Mel... talk about your ""typical screaming companion?"" More like an insult to every companion whose been in the series. In a way, I've felt a lot of the 80's female companions were WORSE than the 70's or even 60's at times... What was the best thing about Mel, her best trait? Oh, yeah, to scream for three minutes in the reprise of the end of Episode One, trip over, get unconscious... I read the rough inital character sketch off the Net that she was supposed to be this smart computer programmer and feminist... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh, stop, I can't breathe, that was better than any stand-up comic.

I haven't mentioned McCoy yet, but that was because I was trying to avoid it. JNT and co. have set up a situation similar to Twin Dilemma, a completely forgettable and awful story, but this time around, Colin and Nicola aren't around to save it. Twin became a good story because of its real storyline of The Sixth Doctor's regeneration trauma. With McCoy and Mel, there's no real electrifying scenes, and the only one that really sticks out is where they suspect each other of being impostors. After that it was back to business. The played down of the scene worked in Robot, with a fun adventure to get into, but when one lead actor is barely acting, and the lead actress makes you want to shoot yourself, that leaves... nothing.

Time and the Rani. The gateway to the sorry state of what Doctor Who was (with some exceptions). It's one thing if the writers intended the story to be a humourous one, but Pip and Jane apparently thought this was a dramatic way to start the season! And you can tell how prejudiced Michael Grade was against Baker, after this season he declared Sylvester McCoy the man who saved Doctor Who!",1203206400,20,3387,4.5917355371900825
690924,4,6303631940,"New theme -- the most emotional theme of the Doctors! It gives you the feeling ""it's the last doctor theme."" First time computer graphics were used. The best theme, in the 1980's is Colins' when he did Trial of a Timelord, which sounds very ""dream like."" It says Part 1,2,3 4 in the episode rather than on title theme -- much rather like in 1960's Doctor Who. The first story explains the use of the Tardis in the bubble.

I love the quarry set, the special effects! It looks more 3-dimensonal! It looks like one big area of caves and amongst a huge quarry! I was initially upset that that Colin was fired previously! I didn't enjoy seeing McCoy in Colin's outfit -- he looked awful in it and he was in it for quite a long time almost entirely in episodes 1 and 2. And yes I actually like Mel as a character (she reminds me of Jo so much -- particularly with that similar dialect of the English accent! I don't know why other people didn't pick that up!) but she does scream rather much! It gets on your nerves at times! Especially when she is trapped in one of the Rani's bubbles -- at least the special effects are good though. The screaming is fairly frequent, but it doesn't ruin the story. But...you think to yourself, I don't think someone her age in real life would scream that much! Maybe a teenager 15 years old, no more!

There are strange creatures that serve the rani -- which have eyes all around their heads which speak in a rather inaudible voice at times. They throw spider webs on their victims to trap them and are quite a bit agile in nature compared with other monsters in Doctor Who.

In a funny way, when the Rani wants her machine fixed and impersonates Mel, she does look similar I wouldn't mind her as a substitute! ha ha But Mel is a very nice person in the show -- she actually likes the doctor and does everything in her will to help him -- like the way she did with Colin's doctor was on trial. I'd certain want someone to rely on like that!

I had doubts about this, but the more I watched it, the more I liked it. Throughout the episode, Sylvester gets familiar sayings mixed up. At the end, for example, he says ""Time and tide waits for no man."" I think when he said ""I'll grow on you Mel, I'll grow on you,"" I think that sums it up pretty well.",1136937600,8,2277,4.23963133640553
690925,3,6303631940,"Following the unceremonious dismissal of Sixth Doctor Colin Baker, the BBC appointed Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the new Doctor, and presumably to gain viewers, brought back Kate O'Mara as the deadly Rani, the cold scientific Time Lord from the Mark Of The Rani story two seasons back.
In the pre-title sequence, the Rani hijacks the TARDIS.  It crash lands, knocking both Mel and the Doctor unconscious and triggering the latter's regeneration, done by McCoy donning a blonde wig while some special effects complete the regeneration.
""The Rani always dabbles on a grand scale"" the Doctor tells Mel, and this involves an asteroid made of a super-dense ""strange matter.""  However, the Rani needs the Doctor to repair something faulty in one of her machines.  To that end, she has commandeered the planet Lakertya, inhabited by yellow-skinned humanoids with reptilian influences and wild hairdos at home on members of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, and taken hostage Beyus, the leader.  There isn't much resistance because the Lakertyans are an indolent race.  The exception is the young Ikona, who survives on the surface avoiding the Tetraps, the Rani's alien servants.  And in a moment that stretches credibility and might even make the Rani retch at doing something so undignified, the Rani disguises herself as Mel, down to her clothing and red wig.
In The Mark of the Rani, the Rani laid some ingenious mines in the forest.  Here, she has more deadly traps, requiring special effects, which involves an energy bubble that traps the victim and sends it flying until it hits a solid surface and then...BOOM!  Pretty devious.
Ikona takes Mel hostage, thinking she is in league with the Rani, but is convinced that she is good and helps her get into the Rani's citadel in search of the Doctor.
The new snazzy title sequence by CAL video used computer graphics for the first time, along with a souped-up keyboard synth version of the theme tune.  The animation of the sequence also used a digital editing system and the Quantel Paintbox colouring system.
Sylvester McCoy has the misfortune of being the Doctor with the worst debut story, but that's not his fault, as his acting of someone in the throes of artificially-induced memory loss, and his rapid-fire delivery is superb.  It's more the plausibility of the story.  I  And the first two episodes seem to consist of the Rani leading the Doctor to her damaged machine and the Doctor getting distracted and wandering around the lab, only to have the Rani lead him back to the machine.  However, he does have a funny time misquoting sayings:  ""Fit as a trombone,"" ""drawing the short plank"", and my favourite, ""absence makes the nose grow longer,"" to the exasperation of the Rani.  Oh, and he has fun playing the spoons.
Another debit is the Tetraps.  Furry dog-faced creatures with bat-like wings, they have four eyes, one on either side of their head, so why does one have to turn around when it can see in all directions?  Their leader Urak seems very impressed with the Rani, though.
Bonnie Langford does good as the vivacious Mel, but I wonder if she outdoes Deborah Watling (Victoria in the Patrick Troughton series) as being the queen screamer, as she exercises her lungs a couple of times upon seeing a Tetraps.
Kate O'Mara shines again as the Rani, even more ruthless than in her debut role two seasons before.  A new hairstyle, maroon outfit, and some makeup are further assets.  Her indifference to the Lakertyans are enhanced by her cold scientifically progressive approach:  ""Am I to abandon my research because of the side effects on inferior species?  Are you prepared to abandon walking in case you squash an insect underfoot?"" she asks the Doctor.
Wanda Ventham, who plays Faroon, Beyus's wife, appeared in the Doctor Who story Image of the Fendahl as Thea Ransome.
Apart from the aforementioned debits, Time of the Rani isn't as bad as its reputation, but could've been better.",1076803200,4,3941,4.914027149321267
690926,4,6303631940,"Except for ""Silver Nemesis,"" this is probably the least popular McCoy episode.  Personally, though, I've always liked it.  Even if the regeneration was poorly explained, I was very glad to be rid of the obnoxious sixth doctor.  I thought the strange matter asteroid and the chronon manipulating device were clever uses of physics concepts (the McCoy era would later drift more and more toward mysticism, something rather at odds with most of Who history).  The Rani herself is a fun character who should have been used more (she was dispassionately amoral rather than actively cruel like the Master).  And I must admit to being greatly amused by the silly closing bit with the Doctor rescuing history's scientists and returning them home in the TARDIS, with Einstein giving a baffled glance at the TARDIS control panel.
McCoy's characterization as a manipulator and pacifist had not been established yet, but I think that's forgiveable in a regeneration episode, the gist of which must always be the new Doctor trying to determine just what his new persona will be like.  I'm fond of the scene where, after being misled by the Rani concerning his past, the Doctor comments that he's afraid that he may not like himself very much.
Lastly--and this point must be emphasized--this episode taught me that absolutely any story can be improved by the inclusion of a giant disembodied brain as a plot point.  Giant disembodied brains are simply cool.  The Brain of Morbius was on the right track, I suppose, but the Rani's synthetic gestalt brain is the size of a Volkswagon, and in my opinion, that makes all the difference in the world.  (For the record, other plot points which improve almost any story in which they appear are meditations on the relationship of the soul to physical reality, magnetic railguns, bellbottom trousers, and elephants).
This was a good episode, a return to older styles of storytelling with a modest, comprehensible plot, a sense of humor, and a welcome departure from the violence and bullroar of the 6th Doctor's era.",1075593600,3,2044,4.953216374269005
690927,2,6303631940,"It has been said that anyone writing the first story for a new Doctor is in trouble, as they're not yet certain how the still-to-be-cast actor will adopt in the role of the series' central character.
But that is hardly an excuse for coming up with a story which is uninspired and uninspiring.  Despite the flashy special effects, nice-looking sets and imaginative design, this story gets off to a bad start and never really improves.  After a pathetic regeneration sequence (though I suppose we should be thankful there was one at all), the whole thing descends into farce as the Doctor blunders about.  The story just seems to consist of characters running about.
You get the feeling it was all written with Colin Baker in mind.  The Doctor's arrogance, brutality (showing a Tetrap to its death) and general carrying-on throughout this story is totally at odds with McCoy's more psychological, sophisticated incarnation.  It makes me really furious when people base their views on the McCoy era on episodes such as this.  Most of the stories in his era are strong and well-written, especially during Seasons 25 and 26.  Meanwhile, Time and the Rani gets two stars for at least being mindly entertaining, if hardly a classic.",1040688000,3,1225,4.91747572815534
690928,2,6303631940,"What a waste. Colin Baker's unceremonious firing as the (sixth)Doctor the preveous season dooms this one from the very begining and we have a chessy regeneration scene. The story (written by the horrible Pip & Jane Baker)is bad, the cliffhangers are awful and while there are some decent special effects, the make-up and costumes are hideous. It only gets two stars becuase it is Dr. Who and I don't have the heart to give it only one.",1002153600,,435,4.662337662337662

As a long time fan of Doctor Who, I wanted to add this to my library.  The name of Sylvester McCoy's co- star in this episode is Kate O'Mara. I have a personal fondness for this episode since I initially watched this with my mom. She's not a Whovian like her son, but she is a fan of Dynasty; so we watched this one episode together.
