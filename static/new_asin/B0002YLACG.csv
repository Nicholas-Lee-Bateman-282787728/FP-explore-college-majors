8174901,5,B0002YLACG,"This boxed set contains four of the B & W Edgar Wallace films from Rialto films. The transfers are very nice and in their correct aspect ratios, including the first of the films shot in Ultrascope (a Germam CinemaScope format). These transfers also contain both German and English soundtracks, although not all of the films in this series of boxed sets do. These films are admittedly an acquired taste, but if you're into these films, these are the best versions available. Please note they are all in the Pal format and require an all regions player. The German sellar was also very nice about emailing me (being in the US) about the films being in the Pal format and packing them well for the long trip from Germany to here.",1397606400,2,726,4.592307692307692
8174902,5,B0002YLACG,"Superb, widescreen transfers and english audio. Four great krimi films from the early sixties. Unbelievable, stunning photography, incredibly stylish direction and high production! These films are unique, something like a combination of James Bond films with italian goth horror. Three of the 4 films are directed by the great Alfred Vohrer. Four dvds in 4 individual, ordinary keep cases! There is also the original german audio with english subtitles. This is one of the best box sets ever.",1384560000,2,492,5.32051282051282
