1623880,5,B00005M2C0,"Owing perhaps a little to the earlier and very influential 'The Road Warrior', Besson's film is a minor masterpiece in its own right.  Despite a few apparent flaws and an ending that is a little too happy, Besson and the film's star Pierre Jolivet have crafted a unique view of one person's survival in a brutal post-apocalyptic world.
'Le Dernier Combat' presents a believably dead world where a few humans struggle to survive and even fewer retain a sense of humanity.  The director fills the movie with striking imagery that grabs your attention and doesn't ever let go.  At one point during a rainstorm it begins to downpour fish; later during another rainstorm two of the film's characters get caught in a hailstorm of rocks!  Scenes such as the very unusual opening shot, Jolivet drowning his sorrows with several bottles of liquor, his escape on a makeshift glider and many others never leave the memory once viewed.  My personal favorite: two of the characters share a bottle of wine at dinner and, as is the civilized custom, each takes a sip from their glass and nod approvingly; cut immediately to an empty wine bottle balanced on a pedestal that someone is using as a target to hone their skills with a sword.  It provides a brilliant parallel between the two types of people struggling against each other here.
What sets 'Le Dernier Combat' apart from others in the post-apocalyptic film genre is the fact that there is no dialogue spoken at all.  Contrary to the criticism that it is a novelty, instead the absence of dialogue draws you into the movie, helping you become intimately connected to the survivors and sharing their experiences as if they were your own.  Moments of suspense, despair, isolation, melancholy, elation, defeat and great joy are all conveyed superbly by the cast without the benefit of speaking.  There is a singular moment where two of the characters say ""Hello"" to one another with the aid of what I believe is helium, but beyond that you won't hear a word spoken in this film.
Most deserving of it's cult status, the movie is best seen on the big screen due to it's being filmed in CineScope.  The DVD release from Columbia Tristar is presented in widescreen and it is an absolutely clean and error free copy that will please any fan of 'Le Dernier Combat'.  Though Luc Besson has had many other film successes since this was released in 1983 this one gets my vote for his best.",1039219200,54,2420,4.710900473933649
1623881,4,B00005M2C0,"This film, Luc Besson's first, is a fascinating work:  originally released in 1983, it's black and white, and with almost no dialogue until close to the end of the film.  In the near future, buildings are mere rubble, and the few people who are left (mostly) cannot speak.  The lead male actor, Pierre Jolivet, who also co-wrote the script, wanders around searching for--something, anything that will let him connect to what remains of humanity.
While some may say this is a pointless exercise, I disagree.  What would you do given those circumstances?  The obvious retort to that question is, Yes, I understand, but why make that into a film?  The answer:  because it DOES capture the imagination of the viewer.  Close to the end of the film, Jolivet finds more than he had dared to think possible.  And you know this is true because you can feel, through his gestures and actions, through the course of the film, what he feels, where his head is.  And where his heart is.  Those he meets, too, are looking for the answer to--why are we still alive?  What are we doing here, anyway?  And when one of them finds another, Who are you?  And who am I to you?
The translation of the film is The Last Battle--to discover these who's and why's.  What these survivors are fighting is the easy but ultimately fatal way out of becoming as desolate, as isolated as a single piece of rubble each of them roams around in.
I won't give anything away about the ending, but let's say that, cliched as it sounds, hope springs eternal.  The manner in which this message is conveyed is far from cliched.  It's a great ending to a captivating film.",1005782400,33,1629,4.562068965517241
1623882,5,B00005M2C0,"""Le Dernier Combat"" takes place in a grim post-apocalyptic future and is Luc Besson's first feature. Even though it won a lot of praise from critics, it has rarely if ever been available in the U.S. If you like Besson, read the history of this outstanding film and buy it.

7944750,4,B00005M2C0,"I don't think its an original, as it offered Korean as a language as soon as I turned it on, but switched it back to English the quality is good for the price. Also, remember it was filmed in the early 80's.",1508889600,,207,3.9523809523809526

7944752,4,B00005M2C0,"A very impressive first film, made on a tiny budget, this highly imaginative, sometimes darkly funny view of a post-apocalyptic world where no one can speak is beautifully shot and designed, elements that would become hallmarks of Bessons style.

There isn't much of a plot, we just observe as several male characters struggle against the elements and each other to survive in the meager pickings of remains of the civilized world.  (For much of the film, we don't know if there are any women left at all). Sand has overtaken and filled office buildings and water is in scarce supply.  If the film were made today, one might guess global warning was the culprit of human decline, but like much else, what happened in the past is allowed to remain a mystery.  And how nice that Bresson has the courage not only to make a film without words, but also without endless exposition.

For all the action implied by the title, this is no Mad Max. While there are a few quite well done fights, much of the film is given over to slower, smaller more human moments, most touchingly, when people try  against all odds  to connect and form bonds.

There are weaknesses.  The film can feel thin, even drawn out at times, and the score can be downright awful.  Why this beautiful, sad, macabre film got an early 80s poppy disco-synth score is beyond me.  Im sure Besson had his reasons, but its been a long time since a score so aggressively took me out of a film.  There are also some logic questions that start to become bothersome.  E.g. Its one thing to postulate that for some reason no one can speak, but since its clear they can read and remember language (and want to speak) why does no one ever write a note? A small thing, but when you leave so much open to question - generally a strength - you do run the risk of those questions becoming vexing.

All that said, I enjoyed the film a good deal, event if I was a bit disappointed, when all was said and done, that it didn't pack more of an emotional or intellectual punch.

BTW - The transfer on the U.K. Optimum 'Luc Besson Collection' blu-ray is terrific, clean and rich, maximizing all the grey tones of Besson's stunning black and white photography.  That can be ordered for a reasonable price from Amazon.uk, but you will need a region-free (or region ""B"") blu-ray player.",1388361600,,2322,4.519138755980861
7944753,4,B00005M2C0,"In a world populated by savages, among the remains of a destroyed civilization, few humans survive.

Brutalized, they have lost the ability to speak and communicate themselves by gestures, fighting to the death for food, or shelter and even life itself.

Shot in glorious black and white, practically no dialogue, this is the first film from director Luc Besson. A cult classic that explores the idea of survival after the apocalypse.",1376092800,,434,5.098591549295775
7944754,5,B00005M2C0,A GREAT FILM! No Dialog. Black & White. Minimal Characters and Weird Scenarios. French New Wave! Pierre Jolivet & Jean Reno star.,1359676800,,129,4.909090909090909
7944755,1,B00005M2C0,"I bought it because I need new ideas in imagination and this flick had none. Yeah, people killing others for no visible reasons is nothing new, sex with sex doll behind suitcase not really fun to watch, kinda drifting aimlessly and finally the hero rewarded with good looking female face. Yes, face is all we see as it ends immediately. Gee, I could do better in kindergarden. Not to mention nobody say anything through all movie and lousy choice of music doesnt add to positive thinking. The movie is supposedly French and sure enough music from another French flick ""La Marge"" was hitting on brain cells.",1357948800,,606,4.726415094339623
