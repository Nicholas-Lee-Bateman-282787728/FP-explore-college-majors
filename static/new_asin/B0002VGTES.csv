8170926,1,B0002VGTES,"Another bad documentary. Good mafia documentaries are rare. This one is just another one with the usual rehashed scenes and photographs. On top of that, there are historical errors. It goes so far as to say that Joe Adonis (Joe Doto) was not Italian (he immigrated from Italy) and that Crazy Joe Gallo was a member of the Gambino family (he really was part of the Colombo family). It seems like this documentary was put together in a hurry just to reap a buck. It totally neglected to compose a qualitative, detailed, and informative historical outline of the Mafia.",1110067200,33,566,4.7272727272727275
