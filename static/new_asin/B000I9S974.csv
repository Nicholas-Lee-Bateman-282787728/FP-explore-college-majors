8144580,4,B000I9S974,"Students all over America have been made to fear tests like little else in life.  I remember an old Val Kilmer movie in which he passes out while being interrogated by Nazis, dreams he is taking an algebra test, then wakes up to his torturers and says ""Thank God it was only a dream!""  I have used this video many times to try to persuade students - who typically will not study for any test because by the time they get to high school they assume they will fail regardless - to put a little effort into passing.  Over the years, I have heard a lot of kids complain about the narrator's bad acting, but I have also had a lot of students tell me it really helped them.  That is, of course, the ultimate test of its value.  I usually show it about 2 weeks before Finals.  It isn't ideal, but then, is anything in the dysfunctional, inhuman world of public education ideal?  It helps, and that is what matters.",1325808000,,907,4.269005847953216
