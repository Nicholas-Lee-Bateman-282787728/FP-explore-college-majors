6453822,3,B00KYL7XZA,"Good entertainment. However, I was expecting more details on each model year. It's 2 1/2 hours long. It does talk about people's love for the car but not each year of car. It has a lot of old commercials and how it came to be. I just thought it would be more informative on the different years and show more examples.",1408147200,3,317,4.213114754098361
6453823,5,B00KYL7XZA,"I love the way this DVD set both tells the history of the evolution of the Mustang as well as interviews actual owners of Mustangs of older and new Mustangs. I didn't know that the Mustang was almost not produced because Ford was still hurting from the failure of the Edsel!

A really nice professionally-produced DVD.

This is a great video as a present for a husband, father or just car-loving friends. I'm going to buy another one to give to my daughter-in-law's father for Christmas because he loves his red Mustang convertible!",1403568000,,532,4.709677419354839

6453827,1,B00KYL7XZA,"This was supposed to be a two disc set but my DVD set only contained 1 DVD.  Since this was a Christmas present, the receiver was very upset.

6453832,4,B00KYL7XZA,Excellent history of the Mustang development and good coverage of all the various Mustang generations. The Mustang story is supported by interesting interviews with Mustang owners and collectors. Good archival material in the form of period tv advertisements.

8662644,2,B00KYL7XZA,"If you're looking for any depth about the origins and creation of the Mustang, you won't find it here. Consists mostly of repetitive stock footage, cheesy music, dull summaries of the Mustang's cultural genesis, and the same footage over and over of different models of the Mustang speeding down a road. Very disappointing lack of substance in the archival material, the narration, and in the choice of interviews, with the exception of perhaps Gale Halderman, who executed the design but didn't originate or engineer it. Basically a collection of sound bites from collectors about why they like Mustangs and how they customized their models, with everyone repeating the same adjectives over and over. Narration sounds like it's by a 1982 MTV-jay. I learned more about the surfer who owns a 4th generation Mach III than I did about Hal Sperlich. As the other reviewer pointed out, almost the only thing of value were the contemporary era commercials for the Mustang at the end. I would expect more interesting information from an 8th grader doing a school report. I was so disappointed, especially for a two-disc set. The whole thing feels like a rush job and has a tacky style overall.",1437004800,2,1186,4.935
