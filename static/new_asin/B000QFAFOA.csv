2837276,4,B000QFAFOA,Great DVD.  Exact episodes that air on Travel Channel without all the commercials. I love it and a great price too!,1234656000,,115,4.476190476190476
2837277,5,B000QFAFOA,"This was my introduction to Passport to Europe with Samantha Brown. I have long been a Rick Steves fan, but lately he has been putting more and more emphasis on visiting churches and this is not one of my interests as a tourist. So when someone recommended Samantha Brown, I remembered that our local library has some of her DVDs.

These seven episodes have just the degree of superficial touristy fun that I was looking for. Samantha Brown is an easy-to-take guide who seems to be having a good time. Her commentary is a little goofy sometimes, but she seems to realize it and doesn't mind laughing at herself.

Since these shows were made for the Travel Channel, they are more commercial than Rick Steves' public TV-oriented programs. Samantha shows us her hotel in each city, taking care to emphasize the name and location. And, as another viewer noted, ""She always shows the bathroom."" There is also a close-up of her shoes in every episode, and usually another accessory (handbag, raincoat) will feature. You won't catch her wearing boring walking shoes or a local sweatshirt. Check the credits and you'll discover that those shoes are paying for her trip.

In spite of these obvious commercial plugs, I found the episodes to be pleasant and informative. In addition to the usual tourist sites that you won't want to miss, there is also at least one off-the-wall sight in each show. In Prague, Samantha buys apple strudel the size and shape of giant burritos, in Amsterdam she buys a fat doobie in a coffee shop, in Brussels she tries raw herring and doesn't gag. In Seville, she visits a bar where the motif is kitschy Roman Catholic -- the bar looks like an altar and there are tacky Virgin Mary and Christ statuettes everywhere. The bartender, in his priest get-up, suggests the house cocktail special: Blood of Christ. Take that, Rick Steves.",1228694400,4,1851,4.778125

2837279,5,B000QFAFOA,"Host Samantha Brown travels to

-  Brussels, Belgium
- Prague, Czech Republic
- Amsterdam, Netherlands
- Lisbon, Portugal
- Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, Spain.

Each show format is a little bit of history of each location, places to visit and travel tips. Samantha Brown also spends some time showing each of the hotels she is staying in, chats with locals, eats some food and looks at Cathedrals, historical buildings and museums.  The hotels she stays at and the way she travels is definitely on a high budget and she can spend a lot more then most people.  The architecture in these cities shown in the DVD is amazing.

If you like travel shows and/or are interested in learning more about Europe and some interesting places to visit, this is a good DVD. Samantha is a fun host and is likeable. I think the travel host has a lot to do with liking the series or not.",1197763200,21,870,4.544871794871795
2837280,5,B000QFAFOA,"I enjoyed this travel DVD, and certainly would recommend it to anyone wishing to travel to Europe, to see things and go to places off the tourist route.  Her Americanism is not annoying, and you do get a laugh at some of her comments.  She mingles with the locals in all regions, takes you to enjoyable places to eat and drink, and talks about the accommodation and gives prices.  She choses the middle to upper types of accommodation in each region, as she travelled in the low season.
I can understand why she was awarded the Emmy for 'Outstanding Lifestyle Directing"".",1193443200,3,571,4.633663366336633
2837281,4,B000QFAFOA,"Of course i love the show, but I don't like how the DVD's are packaged.  There are several episodes missing and I purchased all of the Passport to Europe DVD's.  Why couldn't they just have a season 1 and 2 or at least do one on just Italy, etc.  I would've purchased all the episodes.",1191801600,7,285,4.1454545454545455

8196005,4,B000QFAFOA,"Samantha Brown is hit or miss. Samantha Brown behind door #1 is exciting and adventurous. Samantha Brown behind door #2 is an annoying airhead. The problem is that you don't know which one you're getting until you buy the DVD. I enjoyed her Singapore episode. Her London episodes were good, but could've been better. Her Paris and Japan episodes were horrible.

I bought this DVD solely for the Amsterdam and Madrid episodes- I didn't care about the other cities. In the Amsterdam episode, she showed the city's beautiful canals and parks. She also visited the Anne Frank museum. That was the only time that I ever saw Samantha speak in a somber tone. Samantha really shocked me when she went to a ""coffee shop"" towards the end of the episode as well as the Red Light District. Prior to this episode, I thought of her as a blonde Rachael Ray.

The Madrid episode began with her riding this high speed train. Madrid is an underrated city. It's actually larger than Paris, but not as popular. She went to the Plaza Mayor, which is an outdoor plaza full of shops and restaurants. Samantha made the mistake of stopping by when it was raining and the place was empty. That's why I subtracted one star. She also visited the Prado Museum and this nice looking park. The funniest part of the episode was when she bought cookies from the nuns. The episode concluded with her showing Madrid's exciting nightlife.

I didn't watch the other episodes but if you're just interested in Amsterdam and Madrid, buy this DVD.",1377907200,,1506,4.675471698113207
8196006,4,B000QFAFOA,this is a good show.  it is a travel log type of show.  Sam Brown is a good tour guide in this series she always has some good side comments.  this shows a few places that the every day tourist might not think about taking in.  .,1365552000,,229,3.8085106382978724
8196007,2,B000QFAFOA,"samantha brown should stay away from europe. it is not her turf.  her asian travel videos are far more entertaining than this one in europe. her personality does not fit the aristocracy, boredom and laid back atmosphere of europe.  her vibrancy is fitted well to the asian culture.  watch her asian travel videos and you will see the difference.  the europe travels are boring and too slow and showed mostly old building of yesteryears compared with the vibrancy and progressiveness of asia.",1320019200,,491,4.951219512195122
8196008,5,B000QFAFOA,"Whether or not you enjoy Samantha Brown is very much a matter of taste.  My daughter and I were discussing this and agreed that Brown points out some of the meaningful things to do in each city and warns her audience about some of the touristy things, all the while keeping her show entertaining.  I've been to Brussels, Amsterdam and Barcelona, and thought she did a terrific job with them.  Of course I could whine that she didn't mention the fantastic art museum in Brussels, or the amazing museum of musical instruments; I could be horrified that she said not one word about the fantastic Parc Guell in Barcelona.  But why complain when Brown has whetted my appetite for the enjoyment of a place.  Perhaps the test for me is her show on Prague: I've never been there.  By the time she was five minutes into her tour of Prague, I couldn't wait to buy a Fodor guide and start planning a trip there.

My usual travelling companion swears by Rick Steves; I get nothing out of him.  A matter of taste...",1299456000,,1002,4.467032967032967
8196009,2,B000QFAFOA,"I bought this to show in my Spanish class.  I previewed it and was very disappointed.  It was mostly fluff, too much focused on her reactions rather than the sights, and too silly for my high school students.  Rick Steves is much better.",1287878400,2,237,4.465116279069767
8196010,1,B000QFAFOA,"I thought this might be interesting to see, seven cities in Europe. I was extremely disappointed. The superficial approach that the author takes is utterly boring.
Her comment, ""Barcelona is my favorite city, this is the third time I've been here..."" Blah, I've been there once and have a better appreciation of Barcelona than she does. Barceloneta is a wonderful corner of the city, it's narrow streets and small cafes and restaurants are to be experienced and explored. She plops down in one of the fancy restaurants on the waterfront completely without character or interest.
Her statement about Gaudi's thankfully unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia, was even further off the mark. Once visited you understand why the poor man jumped in front of a bus so he wouldn't have to complete this hideous work. There was no way to finish it. Most people in Barcelona, if she would have asked, would have told her the same thing.
Rick Steves may be a bit dorky, but he's nice in his own way, he gives the viewer a small peak of what it might be like to live in the places he visits.
Samantha Brown makes you feel like you are in a bad movie like ""If this is Thursday it must be Belgium"". It was and I wish I could have gotten off sooner.
Don't view this, don't buy this, don't throw your money away on this DVD. It was a total waste of time. Save your money, go to Europe, experience it for yourselves.",1240358400,4,1405,4.535433070866142
