8194855,5,B000Q7WNDO,"I wish this product had been available to me when I was breastfeeding my own children. I was new mom many miles away from family and a support group of other new moms. Like many women who believe in the benefits of breastfeeding, I was surprised to discover that it's not as easy or intuitive as it seems.  This video would have been very reassuring as I struggled with nursing my first son. The information one needs is beautifully produced in this video.",1182384000,3,456,4.493975903614458
