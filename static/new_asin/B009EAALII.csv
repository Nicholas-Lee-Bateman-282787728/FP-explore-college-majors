5322297,3,B009EAALII,Only 14 songs featured out of a concert that had well over 20 songs and only five tracks were featured from Beyond the Sun recording. Performance of all tracks are first rate though.,1356480000,2,182,4.545454545454546
5322298,3,B009EAALII,This DVD only goes for 55 minutes which is disappointing when you see the song list in the bonus material.  Sound quality is good and performance is great which is not unexpected if you have ever seen Chris Isaak live.,1356307200,7,218,4.45
5322299,2,B009EAALII,"After listening to his previous bluray release (Chris Isaak: Live / Greatest Hits: Live [Blu-ray] (2005)):
(...)
I was expecting the same level of video and audio quality.  Unfortunately this production falls far short in both areas.  The audio level is quite low and the audience applause seems to much more elevated in the rear channels.  In addition fast moving objects have a strobe-like effect -- similar to a 24fps->30fps transfer without motion compensation.  Whoever did the mastering on this disc obviously did not know what they were doing.  Finally, for whatever reason, they cut out the Wanda Jackson parts.  So if you're expecting the same performance that was broadcast on PBS you'll be disappointed.

I'm a huge Isaak fan and this disc is a disservice to him and his band.",1355011200,22,787,4.961832061068702
5322300,5,B009EAALII,great quality in sound and picture. a must for any chris isaak fan or a fan of the memphis style,1354838400,2,96,3.85
5322301,4,B009EAALII,"he's the man. saw him in concert recently and as always, does not disappoint. what a talented dude. this is a good concert with a nice selection of his hit music. I would have bought it in blue ray if it was available.",1412208000,,218,4.093023255813954
5322302,5,B009EAALII,"Great stuff, good video not too much surround sound and must for any collection",1408752000,,79,4.714285714285714
5322303,5,B009EAALII,Sounds good,1404777600,,11,5.0
5322304,5,B009EAALII,"Love him and love his music, costume changes are fabulous, music out of this world...watch it everyday along with the other DVD's of Chris's.  A new and avid fan.",1393200000,,162,4.586206896551724
5322305,5,B009EAALII,"What a great tribute to the musicians and the music Chris covers here. Covered just like the originals only ""cleaner"" if you know what I mean. He brought the same songs done in the 50's and 60's, done exactly the same way, into a full fidelity 2013 recording. Not cleaned up and un click and popped, but full frequency and dynamic range! His efforts to get it right certainly paid off. Both the vocals and instrumental portions are spot on. Always been a Chris fan but this blows me away. What range!",1382572800,,500,4.445652173913044
5322306,1,B009EAALII,"I was really disappointed. This is a stereo recording transformed in surround, or the sound engineer doesnt know whatnhe is doing. The voice should come out of the center speaker.
The quality of the sound is embarrasing as well. Waste of money.
I have the Baja sessions from Chris Isaak on CD: a fantastic recording! Don't know what happened on this Blu Ray.",1379462400,,358,4.698412698412699
5322307,5,B009EAALII,"This video and music was great and enyoyable to listen to.  Chris Isaak represents all the artists for Sun Records in the best way with his versions of their music. I would recomment this music to anyone, great entertainment.",1367539200,2,225,4.769230769230769
5322308,3,B009EAALII,"This was a DVD taken from a recent PBS special. The PBS show was great! This DVD, however, leaves a little bit lacking from the original Beyond the Sun concert and A LOT lacking in the ""bonus feature/special guest"" catagory. The ""bonus freature"" is mearly a repeat of the last chapter of the concert and for those of us who saw the PBS show, the Wanda Jackson live performance is TOTALLY missing! Big rip!",1366848000,,405,4.486486486486487
5322309,5,B009EAALII,"This is my first Chris Isaak DVD and I really enjoyed it. I would have preferred more of the Sun Sessions music, but it was still great to watch.",1364774400,,145,4.0344827586206895
5322310,4,B009EAALII,"Only comment is, 't would be nice if the running time was approx 1h30m.
Now it over before you know.

Thanks Chris and band for the nice performance.",1362787200,,149,4.321428571428571
5322311,5,B009EAALII,"Chis Isaak covers some the best hits of Sun Records with great style.  The only thing better
than listening to him sing is watching him sing.",1362182400,,141,4.423076923076923
5322312,4,B009EAALII,"Another great live performance from the master himself. The only complaint could be that there was just not enough material included. I have tickets to his shows here in a few weeks and this is what I expect to see, just heaps more.",1362009600,,232,4.4186046511627906
5322313,3,B009EAALII,Cheesy production values.  It did not capture the great feeling of a live performance.  Too many shots of the audience.,1361836800,,119,4.9
5322314,3,B009EAALII,"Isaak and his terrific band are in top form, and Isaak's voice is sublime. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of songs from Isaak's ""Beyond The Sun effort"", where Isaak's exquisite voice it truly at home. The Austin City Limits ""Beyond The Sun"" DVD will be available, soon. Until then, this dvd satisfies, featuring a hair-raising version of Isaak's  ""Wicked Game.""",1361145600,,370,5.065573770491803
5322315,5,B009EAALII,"I watched the special on PBS and loved it. This is so much better without the annoying pitches for donations. Mr Isaak and his band always give 100% any time they perform. If you've never seen them in concert, GO! If you like good music this is one very talented guy.",1360281600,2,267,4.254901960784314

5322317,5,B009EAALII,"This blu-ray of Chris Isaak is enjoyable as all his music is.  These hi-def videos are a substantial improvement in video quality over regular DVDs, which makes for a very good viewing experience.",1359244800,,196,4.9393939393939394
5322318,5,B009EAALII,"We went to a Chris Isaak concert last year and this video is very similar to the concert we attended. High Energy, and fun to watch.",1358380800,,132,4.115384615384615
5322319,5,B009EAALII,Can not go wrong with Chris Isaac music. He is the best my wife loves him and thought this was a great album.,1358208000,,109,3.782608695652174
5322320,2,B009EAALII,"Being a huge CI fan, and loving his Beyond The Sun CD set, I was really looking forward to this DVD of the Beyond The Sun concert.  But this isn't it.  This is a very badly put together DVD.  No opening credits, it is filmed on 3 different stages, there is only about 2 songs from the Beyond the Sun album, and the rest are the traditional CI favorites filmed and released for about the 5th time.  The crowd shots are endless, and rather sad to see that CI's fan base now consists of 40+ year olds looking for a early night so they can get home before the baby sitter's go into golden time.  On the music side, the band is as great as ever, the performances first rate!  It's just the song selection, and billing the disk as Beyond The Sun Live is certainly misleading.  Leave this one alone.",1356652800,4,792,4.2052980132450335

8540541,5,B009EAALII,Chris Isaak sings. Only wish it had more of the songs from the cds. Enjoyable but misleading and not what I expected Still a good buy.,1506124800,,134,4.1923076923076925
8540542,5,B009EAALII,"What can I say...I absolutely love Chris & his whole band! This is absolutely awesome. If you've never been to a Chris Isaak concert or don't know much about this mucision, for goodness sakes buy this! You will immediately fall in love with Chris!",1492041600,,247,4.636363636363637
