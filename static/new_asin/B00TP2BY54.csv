7013520,1,B00TP2BY54,"So, it seems MOD on DVD-R is the new way to go!

Well, that will only encourage illegal download, because this support is not available OUTSIDE THE USA!  So if you happen to want to legally buy a physical support but with an international destination, you're out of luck.  And it's not available on Amazon Canada.  This has been the same thing for YEARS about the digital music sold on Amazon.com, and now movies & tv shows too?

And what is the duration of the support?  What will happen if it stops working in 5 years, even if it's not scratched?  Will I be able to ask for a refund0replacement?  No info on quality support life & quality...

This rating/review is not related to the show itself, because I just can't see it.",1442102400,,727,4.406015037593985

7013522,5,B00TP2BY54,"I've been in love with the show Awkward. since it's very first episode. <3 I have literally seen every episode multiple times. I have even went out to own all the seasons on DVD. (: It's kind of a bummer, that this is going to be like all the other DVD-R items on here. :\ But, at least I'll be able to own the fourth season, which is one of the BEST seasons so far, on DVD at last! I'm also super stoked and excited for the new season premiere in August!! <3",1435363200,3,459,3.946236559139785
7013523,3,B00TP2BY54,"I rated this 3 Stars, mainly because this product is being released as a DVD-R product. My BIG question is ""WHY???"" I have purchased seasons one, two, and three and none of them were made using the DVD-R format, so why does this one have to be? I have previously purchased some of Amazons DVD-R materials and have had serious issues with them not working. It's not fun, especially when the item costs almost $30 or more. It's ridiculous. Why pay that much, just for a burnt DVD? I love the show Awkward. I'm just disappointed that it won't be getting an official release this time. I mean, c'mon. There is only season four and five left. Why can't they just release them instead of having amazon burn them and release them as DVD-R material. All I have to say, these DVD-R ones better work!",1429056000,12,790,4.455172413793103

7013528,2,B00TP2BY54,"Love the show, I bought season 2 a few months ago when it was in its own DVD (not the recently released season 1 & 2 DVD), and I had the same issue this time as I did then, before I even opened the wrapper on the DVD, I could already hear loose pieces in my case. I opened it up, and 1 of the discs fell right out. It was already scratched up and would barely play. I haven't played the scratched disc of season 4 yet to see if it works, but I've only had this problem with the MTV DVDs off of Amazon with Awkward, Teen Wolf, etc. Anything else selling from Amazon works well. They need to work on getting more sturdy cases, cause otherwise I'd have a great DVD working. Some items were Xmas gifts and I can't give those out now.",1447804800,,729,3.9659863945578233

7013530,4,B00TP2BY54,Awkward is the perfect name for this show. It is basically nothing like real high school but something about it just makes you keep watching. Having it on DVD makes it much more bearable to watch since they're only 30 minutes long.,1447545600,,231,4.523809523809524

7013533,3,B00TP2BY54,"Well, MTV thinks enough of this show to air it, but not enough to allow its fans to preserve it in the best quality available.

Also, I understand the bleeping on MTV, but it is OUTRAGEOUS to purchase a DVD (even DVD-R) and have the dialog, AND EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, EVEN THE 4 YEAR OLDS THAT MIGHT WATCH THE SHOW, bleeped.  No other show I've ever seen or heard of bleeps out words on their DVD.  Comedy Central even allows all those words now on their shows, and the last I heard, anyone who can get Comedy Central can get MTV.",1444003200,,544,4.211538461538462
