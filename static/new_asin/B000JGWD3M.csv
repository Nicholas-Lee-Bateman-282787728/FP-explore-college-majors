8404653,5,B000JGWD3M,I bought it because I am Welsh and belong to a Welsh Club here in Florida.  I presented the film last Tuesday and from the applause after the end of the film I would say that the film is at the top of the list.  It was nice to know how long Wales has been a country and also how proud I am of being Welsh.  I have quite a few DVD's on Wales but this one deserves five stars.,1487289600,,374,3.65
