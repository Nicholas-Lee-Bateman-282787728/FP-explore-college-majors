8294252,4,B001DN7IUI,"This is an outstanding highly recommended collection of the first six films directed by the Japanese multi-media phenomenon Kitano Takeshi. Variously known as Kitano Takeshi, Beat Takeshi or just plain Takeshi (I will call him Takeshi from now on), this is a film director who is widely misunderstood both at home and overseas. Here in Japan Takeshi is known mainly as a comedian who famously began his career in a strip club in Tokyos red light district in Asakusa called France-za. He teamed up with Kaneko Kiyoshi to make a manzai comedy duo on stage known as The Two Beats with Kaneko playing the straight man (tsukkomi) to Takeshis funny guy (boke). Eventually making his breakthrough on TV and minus his partner, Beat Takeshi (the name he adopts for his TV work and the films which he has to do rather than wants to do) became one of the Big Three comedians in Japan and began his enormously successful TV career which took off in the late 70s and continues to this very day. He still has around ten shows and is firmly established in the Japanese mind as a TV talent. His film career, starting with an acting role in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1982, Nagisa Oshima) and then breaking into directing in 1989 when Fukasaku Kinji pulled out of directing Violent Cop and the producers invited him on-board, was seen in Japan as a mere hobby. He was a TV talent who made films as an occasional pastime and which weren't to be taken seriously. That is how all the films in this set were originally seen by Japanese audiences. It was only when Hana-bi (Fireworks, 1997) won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival that some people sat up and began to pay attention to Takeshi as a serious film director. The fact that Takeshis films subsequently took a dip in quality after Hana-bi means the jury has remained permanently out on him for a great many. Zatoichi (2003) was his extremely successful comeback after the failures of Kikujiro (1999), Brother (2000) and Dolls (2002), but even that suffered in the eyes of many who compared it unfavorably with Katsu Shintaros 1960s immortalization of the role.

Overseas, Takeshis story and reputation goes to the opposite extreme. In Europe and America people were unaware of his TV reputation and as is the case with virtually all subtitled foreign films his work was given the art house treatment by distributors. The French in particular seized on the films in this box with Sonatine being shown at Cannes in 1993 to great acclaim. His first four films were shown at the London Film Festival in 1994 and he suddenly became a director superstar, a major player in international cinema and even Japans new Kurosawa. So which is it? Is he a TV talent making films part-time as an idle hobby, or is he a director God to lay beside Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi and all the greats of yore?

Calling Takeshi a part-timer is just as off the mark as calling him a Kurosawa. Obviously the truth lies somewhere in the middle. He is definitely NOT an art house director. His films do not have the thematic depth or consistency to really amount to a serious artistic statement on anything. On the other hand, his films are always extremely well made, fluidly edited, highly individual and nuanced to a degree which is rarely found. I would describe Takeshi as an extremely accomplished director working at the top end of the commercial film-making range. He generally works well within genres and his art lies in extending the possibilities of what genre can do. Three titles in this box (Violent Cop, Boiling Point, Sonatine) are crime/yakuza gangster films, one (Kids Return) is a youth film part set in the yakuza milieu, one (A Scene at the Sea) is a straightforward love story and the last one (Getting Any?) is an anarchic comedy which sees the Beat Takeshi of TV unwisely stray onto film with unfortunate results. He is Japans answer to Sam Mendes, Anthony Minghella or perhaps Michael Mann, except of course he always works on a limited budget and with actors unknown except for himself. Those directors mold their films using swift cutting, music and conventions which audiences all recognize instantly. Takeshis aesthetic goes against the norm, standing out for his use of long static camera takes, a po-faced style in which characters don't say much and a sense of humor which is black and dead-pan in the tradition perhaps of Jim Jarmusch. Comedy is mixed with sudden violence to startling effect, but there is also sometimes an exquisite lyricism which we see in the last part of Sonatine and throughout the whole of A Scene at the Sea. Takeshis trademark humor is often controversially aimed at marginalized social groups  the old, the stupid, the sick, women, delinquent kids  but he also parodies the yakuza and the police with laconic tough guys often bearing a death wish. The austerity of his world may well recall Bresson and Melville for some, but his aims are ultimately too commercial for this comparison to bear out. The absurdity usual comes with humour attached and is much closer to Aki Kaurismaki say.

Of the six films here only Getting Any? is a stinker, but even that has enough successful jokes in the first half to make it worth a watch. My favorites of the other five are Sonatine and Kids Return which both strike me as being mature muscular working-outs of their material. A Scene at the Sea is a beautiful achievement whose slightness is deceptive. Watch it a few times and its riches will become apparent, or at least they did for me! Boiling Point is the film that initiates the trademark Takeshi yakuza style and the story is richly worked out. Violent Cop wasn't originally Takeshis project though he was always the main star involved, but there is a subtlety here in the inversion of the old Dirty Harry dynamic in which cops and robbers are really just two sides of the same coin. Its an impressive first feature if not in the same class as the later Sonatine. Takeshis most fully-achieved film is Hana-bi which sadly is not included here, but I see it is cheaply available at this point of writing. That is more than I can say for this box which Amazon want over 50 pounds for! If you can find this cheaply elsewhere it is well worth buying. The DVD transfers on Violent Cop, Boiling Point and Sonatine are a shade murky with slight shading in dark scenes, but the films remain eminently watchable. Theres nothing wrong with the other three at all.
