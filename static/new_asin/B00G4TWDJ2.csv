6060118,5,B00G4TWDJ2,"Didn't know this was even available.  Used to watch the Maurice Evans ""mini"" productions.  This was my favorite, and so far as I know, the only one rescued from tape, which was often reused.",1415836800,3,190,4.5588235294117645
6060119,4,B00G4TWDJ2,Image quality is poor but no surprise considering the technology of the time and age of the footage.  Great fun to see so many prominent actors in one sweep.  Special effects have come a long way since then; but you can appreciate what they could do back then nonetheless.,1414108800,7,272,4.530612244897959

6060121,5,B00G4TWDJ2,"The colors may be a little garish - but that's 1960 TV - but what a cast.  Those actors who are well known are from all sorts of training, and they fit together brilliantly.  Maurice Evans was at the end of a distinguished career, but his Prospero makes Shakespeare into music.  For Richard Burton (in Camelot mode at the time) to give us Caliban is luxury casting indeed. Roddy McDowell is Ariel (see the album cover), and he is fabulous.  Others are well trained actors less well known - except for Tom Poston (a Trinculo to enjoy) and Lee Remick (lovely, young and perfect.)  I find this a wonderful addition to Shakespeare movies of Hamlet (pick on), Henry V (ditto), and others.",1409875200,15,683,4.565573770491803
6060122,5,B00G4TWDJ2,"I saw this production on tv back in the 60's and was thrilled to see it finally available. McDowell, Burton and Evans. What a classic!",1391126400,3,134,4.4
6060123,4,B00G4TWDJ2,"The visual quality of this DVD could be a lot better. I would very much like to see a restored version of this production so that we get a better picture quality. However for what it is we can at least still make out what the actors are doing and we can see their faces fairly clearly in medium shots or closer. The audio quality is very good by comparison, so very fortunately we can hear what the actors are saying.
As for the production itself, it is quite bizarre, but entertaining. What else can you say about a famous spectacle-driven Shakespeare comedy about supernatural creatures?
I recommend checking this out if you are a Shakespeare aficionado, or if you're a fan of any of the actors in the cast.",1386633600,12,709,4.461538461538462
8620794,4,B00G4TWDJ2,"Review of The Tempest
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

Everyone knows Lee Remick is beautiful. If you watch Days of Wine and Roses, its clear she can act, too. Lots of people don't know this, but she can also sing and dance, as seen during her Broadway stint of Anyone Can Whistle and her role in the concert version of Follies. But did you know she can speak Shakespeare, too? I didnt, and when I saw her name in the opening credits of The Tempest, I decided not to hold my breath for a believable performance. She was absolutely lovely. Her hair in tendrils, and dressed in a typical white toga, she looked like she just popped out of the forest from A Midsummer Nights Dream. And not only did she look the part, but she delivered her lines beautifully. Very few actors can make me pay attention during Shakespearian plays, and Lee has just joined that list.

Ill admit I consulted Marcia Williamss Tales of Shakespeare before watching this taped live performance. I didn't know the plot, and Marcia helped me out immensely. The Tempest is the story of a father and daughter, isolated on an island. The father has the power to conjure storms, or tempests, and to force sprites to do his bidding. One storm shipwrecks a young man to the island, and sparks fly between the visitor and the daughter. I like this story, and this version was very fun to watch. The costumes were pretty, and all the actors knew their way around the difficult prose. This play walks the fine line between comedy and tragedy, so for those who like their Shakespeare without blood and guts, this ones good for you.",1500595200,,1589,4.513888888888889
8620795,5,B00G4TWDJ2,"This is the very first version of ""The Tempest"" that I saw when I was about 7 years old.  I never forgot it and it was a joy to see it again.  Roddy McDowall's costume impressed me then as it still does today.  There was never a better Ariel.  I'm very surprised that it has survived in such a good condition.",1497225600,3,309,4.016393442622951
8620796,5,B00G4TWDJ2,"This is the TV production that got me hooked on Shakespeare.  Picture quality isn't the best, but the sound is good and the cast top-notch",1458086400,2,138,4.52
8620797,5,B00G4TWDJ2,"This was colorized from the B&W TV production. It is very good. You must make the picture window as small as possible to overcome
the shortcomings of the primitive technology of that time/era.

The cast is superb. Of course it is dated but so is WilliamShakespeare's work by hundreds of years.

Go for this if you are a Shakespeare aficionado.

This is a dynamite addition to my Shakespeare collection.

I remain snobby and pompous. By the way Phoenix Arizona is without culture of any kind.

Unfortunately there is no entertainment in Phoenix like watching the grass grow because it is in the desert.
Observing the paint dry is about all this town as to offer.",1456185600,4,661,4.71304347826087

8620800,5,B00G4TWDJ2,"Terrific. I had an old VHS tape of this. Was so pleased to find it on DVD. Simple performance, dated, but great cast. Richard Burton (Caliban) and Roddy McDowell (Ariel) are outstanding.",1440201600,5,186,4.84375
8620801,1,B00G4TWDJ2,"Garbage.  There is a disclaimer on this saying it is from the early days of TV and it is flawed, but it is not flawed.  It is so smudgy it is unwatchable.",1435536000,,154,3.78125
8620802,4,B00G4TWDJ2,"The video quality is dreadful, but this is to expected from a kinescope transfer. Watch it on a set-top DVD player, and the picture will look like basketweave. Watch it on a computer at reduced size, and the image quality will approach acceptable. The packaging is about as bare-bones as these things get.

All this aside, I was happy to sit though the production again for the first time in fifty-five years. Roddy McDowell's performance as Ariel is worth the price of admission.",1430352000,2,480,4.783132530120482
