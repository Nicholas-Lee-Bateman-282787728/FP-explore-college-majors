8560450,5,B00B0ZTQRW,"First time I watched this show was mid to late seventies. Would watch every episode however I cannot remember if I ever cried while watching.
As soon as I saw it being sold here on Amazon I decided to buy it. The episodes are exactly as I remember, however, I could not stop from crying. This Japanese animation is about friendship, love, trust, hope, hurt, deceit, in other words... life.
Now, in regards to the box the dvd comes in may I say for the price I paid for it, I am not impressed. Higher quality of wood and the construction of it would have been better.
I am giving five stars to the dvd but only three to the box.",1372291200,6,627,4.190082644628099
