2413278,5,B000BC8T1E,"Sad to say,but Season Five was all she wrote for The Twilight Zone. As a TZ fan and for this incredible release of the entire
series in ""The Definitive Edition"" i give five stars for the
fifth season and the entire set altogether! The reproduction of
the master film negatives of this series is absolutely a work
of art. For all of the (many of the) sour grape reviews that
have been posted here at Amazon about pricing and the sets not
worth buying are just that - sour grapes. Sci Fi Channel ran a
TZ marathon this past New Years Day(as usual)and i checked in
just to have a look see. The quality was absolutely awful,as in
real bad and i used to think they looked good for their age...
man if any of you saw those on t.v. and compared them to this
set,like me,you would have been shocked. As far as Season 5
being the weakest of the series,compared to itself and Season
4,maybe,but it still beats anything out there. Episodes from
this season absolutely rank near the top of all the earlier
seasons. Remember- Nightmare at 20,000 Feet-Steel-Living Doll-
The 7th Is Made Up Of Phantoms-Number 12 looks just like you-
Night Call-The Masks-Stopover in a Quiet town-RinG-A-Ding girl-
A kind of Stopwatch-Spur of the Moment...these are no slouches.
All the remaining episodes were very good and many i had
forgotten about,all with moral endings and relating to us as
human beings with all of our faults and good and bad qualities.
There is even the ""old time version"" of ""Christine"" titled -
""You Drive"" long before ""Christine"" was made! You are missing a
real treat if you don't invest in this series .In fact,i will
bet that before long - this ""Entire series,all 5"" will be re-
leased as one set. Either way,dont miss out! MUST ADD THOUGH:
The worst TZ in history is the last one made""The Bewitching
Pool"" - a real bad CLUNKER!",1136332800,8,1827,4.539393939393939
2413279,5,B000BC8T1E,"Alas, we have the final season set of the original Twilight Zone series.  The final season of any TV series always seem to run a bit low on gas but there are so-so episodes in all 4 of the previous seasons.  Season 5 does have a couple of mediocre episodes but flashes of pure brilliance shine with the likes of 'Living Doll' and the one episiode that still makes me jump in my seat, 'Nightmare at 20,000 Feet', especially when William Shatner pulls back that airplane window curtain.  ""Brrrr""!!!!!!

In all a very decent season set to conclude Rod Serling's  magnificent 'Definitive' Twilight Zone series.",1130976000,23,606,4.733333333333333
2413280,4,B000BC8T1E,"By 1963-64, when the final season of Twilight Zone was being filmed/aired, the show had already gone through a cancellation, a name change, a change in length and was going on it's 3rd president in office. So many wonderous ideas had made it onto the screen that the well understandably began to run dry. In the realm of science fiction, quite often a writer will begin to rely on cliches more so often after years in the genre.

  Such is the case with season 5 of Twilight Zone. Shows of this season lacked the precise structuring and engaging story lines of earlier seasons. Episodes such as 'Uncle Simon', 'Ring-A-Ding Girl' and 'Ninety Years Without Slumbering' simply lacked a feeling of involvement, and others such as 'The Bewitching Pool' were just poorly made, going so far as to intercut an overdubbed adult voice for that of a child character. Yet with all these complaints, I would be the first to say that with a show like Twilight Zone, I find myself returning to the clunkers with blissful abandonment, as there is a certain charm to even the worst that this series has to offer. And there are certainly plenty of clunkers available here for those viewers so inclined to induldge.

  But in a strictly objective sense, season 5 was arguably the worst of the series, with season 4 the only other contendor (although the different length format makes the two almost impossible to compare). However, the winners of this season unquestionably stand with the best of any other, amongst them being 'The Masks', 'Living Doll', 'Garrity and the Graves', 'Steel', 'In Praise of Pip', 'Last Night of a Jockey' and probably the most well known of the season, 'Nightmare at 20,000 Feet'.

  The probable cause of the downfall of this season (other than Serling just becoming drained and disinterested), as mentioned in Mark Scott Zicree's companion book, has to do with the fact that the final 10 to 15 shows of the season were written by authors who had never previously done work on the show and who probably had no deeper understanding of the mechanics inherant therein. Twilight Zone always had certain thematic elements that were steadfast, involving evil getting it's 'just dessert' alla 'Death's Head Revisited', and depicting human tradegy as devastating, alla 'Time Enough At Last'. However, you will notice that shows in the 5th season written by these lesser authors thematically violated the time-tested zone structure, although again I find this to be curiously interesting from a fan's point of view.

  I suppose the bottom line is that, regardless of how poor many of the shows from season 5 were, they are still better than 99% of the trash on TV today, and any fan of the series should own this one. Flaws aside, the gems included more than make up for any shortcomings.",1129680000,145,2792,4.830188679245283

2413464,5,B000BC8T1E,The Ambrose Bierce short story that this episode is based on is an excellent work of fiction. When I first read it I thought this would make a great episode of the twilight zone. How delighted to find that there was an episode  (though actually a French movie). It was excellently done and well worth watching several times. One of the best episodes ever and would recommend it to everyone. With the exception of a song that was in it (which should have been deleted) no more than a dozen words were spoken in the entire episode yet it accurately portrayed the story as it should have.

I love this product better than the definitive edition because I only care about watching the episodes and the special features are very superfluous to me. The DVD case on this product is also a lot thinner than the definitive edition dvd case. highly recommend for fans of the Twilight Zone. I consider season 5 to be the worst of all 5 seasons of the original series. Season 5 still has some great episodes such as Nightmare at 20,000 feet and living doll starring Telly Savalas, However the show really started to lose its pride by this final season.

I am living it now. My mother and brother could not hear the lessons, and now live in big  houses and yet rail against the rich. They have no idea that they are insane, stupid and immoral, like the soldiers. I am a woman of virtue in a world of deception which would either cage me or kill me. However, the mans's ""fantasy"" is the reality of heaven, and this shared manifestation is hell. I'm just observing as regression continues, as heaven is the opposite of that: eternal progression. Honesty is rare. Deception is everywhere. What a waste. Those with all the potential for magnitude choose a desceding world of fakery celebrity and form over substance.

2413752,3,B000BC8T1E,"My opinion about the last season in this 5 year run of a very popular early TV program like Twilight Zone is that the series was progressively getting into more edgy and dark themes that did nothing good for one's night of sleep.  This continued to be borne out as a later series called ""Night Gallery"" was broadcast by CBS and I saw a distinct change in thematic delivery and program writing that was dark, darker, and darkest.  Instead of very clever writing themes, the story flow resulted in unsatisfactory outcomes that showed no resemblence to reality.  Sorry, but I just did not like the changes occurring.",1403308800,,613,4.710280373831775

The quality of the restoration of the episodes makes it all too clear to me now why I have such a warped mind.  Seriously, I believe that each generation can appreciate the series, whether for its psychological 'gotchas,' its stellar writing, acting and direction, or even just to see famous actors in their younger days.

I know some of them almost by heart although I haven't watched them in 50 years.  This was the Golden Age of TV at its best.  Some of the stories I would rank among the best TV dramas ever written.  There was usually a unusual twist in the story line that made think about them for years.  Many of the stores also reflected the fears of sixties:  an imminent nuclear threat or the Red Scare.  There were as much commentary on current events as they were on human nature.",1400112000,,578,4.238532110091743

2413788,5,B000BC8T1E,"It is amazing that this show is 50 years old and still delivers a powerful message in many of its episodes. Some episodes even have influence on popular young adult literature.  Number 12 Looks Just like You Is expanded in the book/series, ""The Uglies"", where teens get new bodies and new minds to make them mindless and easy to control. I am not mentioning this to imply the author had no imagination, the series is far more involved than a 24 minute show, I only wanted to make the point that a 50 year old show had a story that popular culture today finds fascinating. The acting is serious in these shows, and the characters are well played. Getting beyond the social factors, where the men cant seem to cook for themselves and the women are always stuck somewhere in uncomfortable footwear.

The one thing that can throw me off in the Twilight Zone is the technology, which can sometimes turn an episode from serious into downright humorous. I am not saying the show is in anyway bad, I just don't think the technology consultant (if there was such a person) thought things through on some episodes. From Agnes-With Love is a perfect example, as this advanced computer is giving advice to a human, it does so on what looks like a piece of cardboard. However, it does not print, there is no lag, it just appears. Even with computers today, we need to wait for data to generate either on the screen or printer. Nothing just pops up in full sentence form faster than human speech, like a human flipping dialogue cards. So, it was rather amusing.

On the other end of that is the interesting piece. Some of us viewers never lived in this time, others may have been born when television already had 120 channels. The point is, things were done differently, like kids had fun kicking a can? Not sure why. Or running around the yard with a big hoop and hitting it with a stick, not sure what that was either. Then the swim wear was interesting. Payphones were extremely popular, so were train rides. It is like this window into the past that you won't learn about in a traditional way that most people care about. In some sense, it is like being dependent on a show about the future to reveal its mysteries of how things work. They don't have cellphones, computers, or faxhow will they ever get to see that picture? Its fun, well I think so anyway.",1392508800,,2346,4.502347417840376

2413794,3,B000BC8T1E,"Season five would be the final season in the original run of the legendary TV show but it still managed to produce some of the series best episodes.  Despite that, CBS pulled the plug on the show in 1964.  There was interest from ABC in bringing the series over to their network although the version they had in mind was far different from that of Rod Serlings so he declined.

Richard Matheson contributed four stories to the fifth season including one of the greatest episodes ever, Nighmare at 20,000 feet which finds a terrified airplane passenger named Bob Wilson played by a young William Shatner, seeing a horrific monster on the wing of the airplane, attempting to bring the plane down.  While Wilson is taken away in a strait jacket when the plane lands, the airport crew finds what appears to be scratches on the planes wing.  Terrific and horrifying episode which would later be remade starring John Lithgow in a segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie.

Steel based on another Matheson story, isn't a great episode, but its tale of robot boxers would be remade in 2011 as the big screen film Real Steel.

Another one of the shows great episodes was An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge based on the tale by Ambrose Bierce.  A Civil War prisoner is set to be hung by a group of Union soldiers.  But as he drops, the rope remarkably breaks allowing him to fall safely into the creek and escape.  He arrives home to his elated wife and is about to hug her when he falls at the end of the rope and his neck snapshe had been hallucinating about escaping the entire time.

Other outstanding episodes from season five include Caesar and me about a down and out ventriloquist and his dummy that comes to life and Stopover in a Quiet Town about a couple who wake up in a strange house and find that the food and telephone are mere fake propsthey then discover they are merely the toys of a giant girl and are inside of her dollhouse.",1391299200,,1929,4.482857142857143

2413806,5,B000BC8T1E,"The final season of Rod Serling's weird-a-thon continues the tradition: occasionally uplifting, sometimes downright scary, but always entertaining.

Perhaps the highlight of the season is the-thing-on-the-wing drama, ""Nightmare at Twenty Thousand Feet,"" featuring a pre-Star Trek William Shatner, trying desperately to act his way out of a paper bag. Other heavyweights include Lee Marvin, Anny Blyth, Sterling Holloway, Mariette Hartley and Ed Binnsto mention only a few.

The intentional -- and sometimes, from a modern perspective, unintentional -- stereotyping plays out more-or-less as you'd expect from a '60s TZ (always ahead of its time in confronting racial issues) but there's more to this than a simple morality play. Some great storytelling and a potentially ambiguous ending makes this a standout.

Instead of ordering the hard DVD, I downloaded episode 23 of Twilight Zone's season 5 for a few bucks -- the high-def version. It played beautifully! In short, if you want to view this unique short film, which Rod Serling chose to relay to American audiences on his show, then download it.

2413897,4,B000BC8T1E,"As a kid I really enjoyed watching the Twilight Zone because it was such a relief and departure from the rest of the drivel that was part of the vast wasteland that was then and especially now television.  The other show that I loved was One Step Beyond and that show was unappreciated as more people enjoyed Serling's hamminess and grimacing than John Newland's subtlety and irony.  The shows here are interesting and many of the authors, like Charles Beaumont, are favorites of mine so there are many things I like.  The one thing I dislike is the none too subtle hammer that Serling or who ever else is writing or directing used to pound  their message at you.  If you're watching the Twilight Zone, especially then, you had to have accepted the basic concepts of good and evil and the brotherhood of man so that basically they were preaching to the choir.  Did they think the local Klan was going to watch the show and stop the cross burning because now they were so ashamed?  The best show here doesn't have a message.  That's the one about a National Guard unit maneuvering around the Little Big Horn.  It has Warren Oates  and it's just fun to watch.  That's the case for the most part. The most enjoyable shows are just flights of imagination and humor and set the preaching aside for the moment.",1368921600,,1304,4.52991452991453

This the fifth and final season is now in Blu-Ray format and while not every episode looks great on 1080p due to the various states of deterioration of the original master tapes they are certainly a whole lot better than the dvds. The sound quality for the most part has been cleaned up and hisses are few and far between. What I like about the Twilight Zone is that I never seem to tire of watching the episodes over and over again as I always seem to find something new that I missed on previous times. Not all the episodes in this fifth season score but the ones I liked the most are: ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet"", ""Living Doll"", ""You Drive"", ""An Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge"", ""The Jeopardy Room"", ""The Encounter"", and ""Mr. Garrity and the Graves"".

Most episodes have excellent picture and sound quality and in fact this has improved a great deal over the previous seasons as well. Overall this is a very good blu-ray set of season five of the series.

The Transformation is a form of beauty conditioning that causes every man and woman to be graced with a standard beautiful face, well-sculpted body, and long life besides.  Who would not want to do this?  Well, the young lady protagonist in this story decides that she would just rather be herself with her own average face, body, and looks.  Her choice, right?  Not so fast.  This is both a humorous episode, and one with a subtle and profound message about the pressures of conformity.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1328313600,,662,4.787610619469026
2413940,5,B000BC8T1E,"I've been a fan of The Twilight Zone ever since I saw William Shatner's classic performance in Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. Normally, I'm skeptical about older shows being remastered like this for Blu-ray, but overall, I'm pretty impressed. In a nutshell, here's what I think about The Twilight Zone on Blu-ray.

GOOD
- the quality of the transfers look very impressive in HD, there's no artifacts or other anomologies sometimes seen in the DVD version
- the audio tracks have been restored and remastered and they give a lot of new depth to some of the classic episodes
- a nice collection of episodes that still stand the test of time
- great extras are included, including interviews and other behind the scenes bits

BAD
- the set can be kinda pricey, so shop around for the best deal

Even if you have these on regular DVD, I realize that it can be daunting to buy another series AGAIN, just to have it in HD, but trust me, it's worth it.",1326326400,,940,4.485380116959064
2413941,5,B000BC8T1E,"This is an amazing story of a man, whose son, Pip, is dying in Vietnam. ""There wasn't even supposed to be a war there."" The father says. Keep in mind that this episode was released in 1963; early days of Vietnam. Pip goes through surgery and the doctor says if the kid survives an hour he might make it through a long life. During that one hour, in the Twilight Zone, the man has one last chance to make things right with his son.",1317513600,,430,4.130952380952381

Whether it be a first time purchase or replacement for the regular definitive dvd versions, the crystal clarity and remastered sound is simply stunning.  The resolution is so high that, in close ups, you can see the pores on people's faces and see the individual fibers that make up their clothing.  I am simply amazed that they could take old film and make it look so good.  What you see on this set is likely better than anyone has ever seen them, even when they were originally broadcast.  The bonus features are cool and also in HD as well.  I love the packaging.  It's slim and the same size as any other single disc bluray release.  It has two sturdy flaps on the inside that hold the discs very nicely.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  You will not be disappointed!!!",1316217600,8,836,4.398692810457517
2413944,5,B000BC8T1E,"KUDOS to the folks at Image for NOT using evil DNR which would have destroyed Mr. Serling's original intent. To those that do not know, grain is an literally part of the physical composition of silver nitrate. Grain=Detail not the opposite. To remove grain no matter how carefully always removes fine detail. So much detail is in this Blu-ray set you can even see the ripples and sheen of Rod Serling's herringbone suits in some of the intro's. That and the tiny lines on actors faces is detail to the MAX, almost like viewing the original film elements.  Look how realistic Shatner's [over exagerrated :)] facial expressions are in Nightmare at 20000 Feet. On my 50"" plasma I can see every tiny line on his face as if he were actually standing in front of me.  You don't get that when DNR is used, what you do get with DNR is a waxy unnatural/unhuman look. See example here: [...]

The folks at Image should also be proud for giving us unaltered, uncompressed sound as an option. For those of us who despise unnatural processed modern digital sound and this is a blessing of blessings. Coupled with the pristine video which thankfully was left totally unmarred in transfer due to no DNR or ee [edge enhancement], this Blu-ray set is as close to as a pristine 35MM print as any of us will ever get. This set showcases Mr Serling's genius rather than try to conceal it in a shoddy revisionist modern manner and is truly reference quality.

Only negative for me is the non inclusion of the PBS American Masters ""Submitted For Your Approval"" documentary that was present on the Season 5 DVD set. While this set is still 5 stars, the absence of the documentary leaves it just short of perfection. Brief note to Image, if you include it on the eventual complete  5 Season Blu-Ray box set, I will be taking away stars for being shafted.

To the people at Image thank you again for NOT using amateurish cheapo digital hacks like DNR or EE and PLEASE PRODUCE ALL your Blu-Ray using the same level of quality and professional efforts as your Zone sets!!!!!

Many company's [ie: the morons at Anchor Bay or New Line] could learn many valuable lessons on proper Blu-Ray mastering from the people at Image who worked on these zone sets.",1315699200,29,2224,4.586901763224182

2413946,5,B000BC8T1E,"There are pros and cons to this fifth and final set.  First of all season 5 did not go without a fight, there are memorable episodes, In Praise of PIP, Number 12 looks just like you, Nightmare at 20,000 feet, You Drive and many many more.  There were 12 original audio commentaries from the standard definition DVD set.  The Blu Ray includes them plus 20 somewhat more.  Sadly the turkeys get some audio commentary such as Uncle Simon and Probe 7 over and out.  I was kind of hoping Stopover in a quiet town would get some treatment, However the most conversational Episode ever ""The Encounter"" gets audio commentary with Twilight Zone Companion Author Marc Scott Zicree as well as George Takei who stared in the episode.  I like the fact that you get some more of the Twilight Zone Radio Dramas......what I don't like is that the 90 minute documentary Submitted For your approval is not included......It was in the fifth season SD version why not the Blu Ray?  Well this was a show about writers and irony so sit back relax and get into the zone.",1314748800,5,1047,4.537234042553192
2413947,4,B000BC8T1E,"There are great episodes in Season Five such as the classic Nightmare at 20,000 Feet; The Masks; Living Doll; Last Night of the Jockey (featuring Mickey Rooney who provides a wonderful character study of a pathetic yet defiant loser with a literally out-sized view of himself); Night Call; An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge and A Stopover in a Quiet Town. Then there were some genuine surprises including entries during the so-called dead zone of the last 10-15 episodes. I was struck by how good and though-provoking The Encounter was. I cannot imagine it not stirring up some controversy when it was first released. Neither character is a hero or villain. Both are deeply conflicted in a way that feeds into the dark, tragic ending of this underrated masterpiece with two wonderful performances by George Takei and Neville Brand. I expected The Jeopardy Room to be a throwaway but it was anything but that . . .feeling like a pilot episode of one of CBS's next great classics - Mission Impossible, both in its feel and intensity. I found that the topics of race; hatred and the mob mentality were intelligently explored in I am the Night: Color Me Black. Even the ones that felt like variations on themes that were previously touched upon in TZ were well-acted and executed - Uncle Simon; Queen of the Nile; A Kind of Stopwatch; Caesar and Me; The Fear and The Brain Center at Whipples- albeit with an occasional line or two in the dialogue or plot that could have been been rendered more imaginatively. There are a few dogs including boring and aimless Come Wander with Me; The 7th is Made of Phantoms which simply approached its intriguing premise all wrong from the get go (despite the presence of such lumineries as Warren Oates and Greg Morris) and the insufferable Sounds and Silences which wasted John McGiver's talents on an script that manages to be far more overbearing than its odious central character.  But even the misses such as the Old Man and the Cave; Uncle Simon and Probe 7, Over and Out have been far more watchable than I expected. I have got about 11 more to go in the Season and will no doubt be sad to see The Twilight Zone come to an end. Oh well, there is always Lost and Fringe to be explored.",1314489600,2,2222,4.611111111111111

The episodes have been restored to pristine condition and the set featutes an array of features that will more than please fans.

2413949,5,B000BC8T1E,"The 1963-1964 TV season would mark the final year for ""The Twilight Zone"". Creator and headwriter Rod Serling simply became exhausted from writing the bulk of the series' scripts and he was tired of always butting heads with sponsors and network executives, namely James Aubrey, who wanted ""Twilight Zone"" off the air the first day he became head of CBS. Many ardent ""Twilight Zone"" fans have referred to the last season as the shows' worse, but thankfully these episodes are on DVD, uncut, without commercials for enthusiasts to enjoy for posterity. Serling also didn't write many of the the shows' last epsiodes and this is eveident: the scripts were not as strong and involving as other seasons.

2413950,5,B000BC8T1E,"After season Four's experiment with the hour long format, in which stories got more depth and time to unfold, sometimes a very desireable thing, season five finds a return to the half hour format and a little ""tighter"" storytelling.

With a return to the half hour, the stories have to move along and we don't get to dwell on or ponder things as much. But, because the writing was still very good, they managed to keep the stories interesting and maintain consistent quality content.

Yes, by now the series was beginning to run short on ideas, and sadly, it does show. However, compared to what is out there in today's market, these stories hold up very well for forty year old tales. Because the quality of writing was generally better back then, even for ""bad"" shows, compared to today, we can visit these episodes and find them quite enjoyable.

The nice thing about stories such as these is that though the costumes and cars and things like that are ""dated"", the characters and stories are not. And much of the subject matter throughout the whole series remains reasonably topical even today. And shows that deal with the human condition - which doesn't change - generally fare better over time than those that try to capitalize on the trendy stuff of the time in which they were created.

For that reason, I find the whole of the Twilight Zone series of consistent high quality and can easily recommend it to fans of the fantasy/science fiction camp.",1266192000,2,1456,4.698039215686275

As described in the promotional literature, newly struck prints from the original camera negatives are used for the transfer to DVD, providing a superb image, and especially good when played on an upconverting player.  The extras throughout the 5 seasons are great, my favorite being the appearance of Rod Serling on the Jack Benny Program.(This is not in the 5th season, however.)

Get yourself a copy of the ""Twilight Zone Companion"" book, and decide which episodes you like best.  Then get the seasons containing them if you can find them, or the entire series if you have to.  (Retail $250-$300)",1252627200,,774,4.923076923076923

There is an extra DVD in this set, a laughable documentary titled ""Submitted for Your Approval"" which is also available as a single on Amazon. Just noting it so you don't buy both and find yourself in possession with a duplicate.

One small note: I definately agree with other reviewers. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages includes ""everything"" about the classic series and is a wonderful companion with the DVDs. The book details Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you. What you do is watch an episode and then read up on it in the book and you'll discover a wealth of trivia that makes this worthy of appreciation. Both the DVD set and the book is on Amazon.com.

I spent less than $140 for the complete DVD set and discovered more treasures, rare filmed interviews, bonus extras and high-quality transfers that are far superior to what I have been watching the past 20 years.

Some of the series' best gems can be found in this box set. The commercial billboards are great. The radio audio dramas are enjoyable. Some of these episodes, however, do not include original music score compositions. Mickey Rooney's audio commentary is awful. Grouchy, grumpy and frankly, the only reason I see them even including the commentary is to show the public how grumpy he can be. And rude. Other than that, the box set is great.

The retail price keep lowering over the months but by now it's beyond affordable. I recommend you grab this season box set today.

I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun.

2413969,5,B000BC8T1E,"Twilight Zone has entered popular culture over the decades because of its unique approach and vision. Rod Serling set out to produce a science-fiction/fantasy series of quality. He strove for it and acheived it and this is why the show has become legendary. The episodes are so well done that they bear up over repeated viewings. Extremely well in fact. Season 5 of this landmark show does have its ups and downs but most of these episodes are classics. ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet"" with William Shatner is one. ""In Praise Of Pip"" is another. How about Mickey Rooney in ""Last Night Of A Jockey""? And there's ""Night Call"", ""The Encounter"" with George Takei... Many classics I am hesitant to discuss lest the enjoyment of a first-time viewer be lessened. Also, the set has been digitally remastered from the original film negatives for a beautiful picture and sound. And the bonus features are great, featuring interviews on screen and audio with many of the people involved with these episodes. If you've never taken a trip to the Twilight Zone then I envy you because you have the opportunity to experience these timeless tales for the first time. Enjoy!",1148947200,3,1152,4.852791878172589
2413970,5,B000BC8T1E,"The Twilight Zone is one of my black & white shows of all time. I am so glad all the seasons are now released on DVD. Season five is my favorite season. Although most will argue that the fifth and final season was the weakest, I believe the fifth season had quite a few gems in it. My favorite episodes include: Night Call, The Fear, The Masks, The Bewitchin' Pool, From Agnes with Love,A Stopover in a Quiet Town, You Drive, Number twelve looks just like you, Old Man's Fancy, and that William Shatner epsiode Nightmare at 20,000 feet. I love all the seasons, even the hour episodes from the fourth season. But there is something sad and special about the fifth season, I know creator/genius Rod Serling did not write a lot of episodes the fifth season but his other writers are incredible and creative like he was (Charles Beumont, and Richard Matheson). Don't waste another moment, buy this season today! ""You are traveling into another demension....""",1147824000,3,954,4.684523809523809
2413971,4,B000BC8T1E,"Considering the quality of todays science fiction, season 5 of TZ is monumental.  The TZ storys are well crafted, and not just monsters in space with lots of blood and gore and guts.

""Cowboys in space, shoot 'um ups"" get rather tiring, so, all five seasons fo TZ are a good place to spend time, being at one, with your brain cells.",1142985600,3,332,4.338709677419355
2413972,5,B000BC8T1E,"I THINK THAT THE THING THAT SCARES ME THE MOST IS THAT THIS MAY BE THE LAST SEASON. THE FIRST FIVE DISC'S OF SEASON 5 CONTAIN THE USUAL TWILIGHT ZONE EPISODES. BUT DISC SIX ""SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL,"" GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS.  I WON'T GIVE AWAY THE BEGINNING, BUT AS ODD AS IT MAY APPEAR OF AN INTRODUCTION FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET, I THINK THAT ROD WOULD HAVE REALLY APPRECIATED IT.  MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS HOW DISTASTFUL TO MAKE A MOCKERY OUT OF SOMEONES DEATH, BUT AS YOU KEEP WATCHING THE REST OF STORY, YOU START TO GET A DEEP INSIGHT INTO ROD SERLING.  AND YOU JUST KIND OF KNOW THAT ROD WOULD HAVE APPROVED. EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE OTHER TWILIGHT ZONE DEFINITIVE EDISION SEASONS, YOU MUST GET THIS ONE.",1142294400,3,734,4.343065693430657
2413973,5,B000BC8T1E,"Season Five offers far more good or great episodes than weak or bad ones, and the influx of new writers toward the end of the season infused the series with hefty doses of much-needed creativity.

In fact, casual Twilight Zone viewers and even aficionados may find this Season Five collection to be *more* rewarding than Seasons 1-3, since many of these episodes are far less widely circulated, but every bit as well done.",1140912000,4,422,4.780821917808219
2413974,5,B000BC8T1E,"...I love this collection.

I got a few of the previous DVD release (the ones grouped by theme rather than chorologically), but knew I couldn't afford to get all of the episodes in that manner. I started buying the ""definitive"" series about the time the third season came out. It took about a year all together, but it was much less cost and effort than the previous releases.

The quality is outstanding (but then, I'm easy to please), and I really enjoy the trailers for ""next week's show"" at the end of each. The commentary tracks on some episodes and occasional interviews are fun as well.",1140739200,5,593,4.584905660377358
2413975,5,B000BC8T1E,"The twilight zone is heavily based on the metaphysical outcomes of quantum physics, relativity and psychology. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is cristal. I won't have to wait for the sci-fi channel marathon to watch them. Overall: EXCELLENT!",1137024000,5,257,5.2926829268292686
2413976,5,B000BC8T1E,"I am not sure why none of the product descriptions online have the correct information about the audio commentaries and video interviews for Season 5.  Here is what's included on Season 5:
Audio commentaries: Mickey Rooney, Mariette Hartley, Martin Landau, June Foray, Bill Mumy, (and TZ Companion author Marc Zicree).  Video interviews: Terry Becker, June Foray, Nancy Malone, Bill Mumy, Carolyn Kearney, Michael Forest, and writers Earl Hamner, Richard Matheson, George Clayton Johnson.
These were splendidly produced...and I sure wish Seasons 1-3 had the video interviews.  Oh well, hopefully they'll release TZ again someday and they'll be included.  Although the video interviews are all great, a few of the audio commentaries (for this set, and on the previous seasons) leave something to be desired.  Mickey Rooney's borders on insane - he's so elderly now and obviously sick of discussing his career.  He pretty much grumbles his way through the 23 minutes of his episode and obviously only agreed to do it for the money.  Martin Landau, too, fakes his way through the episode he appeared in, obviously remembering nothing significant about it.
The video interviews were edited well, and the actors & writers mostly comment on their careers and the time period of Twilight Zone, not quite as much about the episodes they starred in/wrote.  The other bonus features on this set, including ""Conversations with Rod Serling"" and a bonus disc of ""Submitted for Your Approval"" (90 minute documentary) are great.  I hope someday more of Rod Serling's stuff is released on DVD.  This Definitive Edition series is splendid, overall.",1136678400,28,1631,5.2384615384615385
2413977,5,B000BC8T1E,"Let me start off by saying that I am sick of reviewers and other people whining and moaning about how ""they"" are just trying to make money by re-releasing The Twilight Zone.

Well, duh!

Since when has an Entertainment Megacorporation been a charity?

At least they are re-releasing it in an incredible way.

The earlier sets, in random order and practically special feature-less, were made when DVD was in its infancy. The format has gone under a lot of change, and expectations have been raised.

Image flies over those expectations. These new Twilight Zone sets truly are ""definitive"" and the show will never, ever get a better treatment than this on DVD. In fact, except for slightly higher image quality (the shows look great enough here) I really can't see it ever getting better treatment when future formats come out.

If you didn't buy those other sets or single DVDs that came out years ago, then this is well worth the money. This season happens to have many of the series' most famous episodes, like ""Living Doll"" and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.""

Even those who did buy the other sets, if they're fan enough, might consider buying the DVDs over again.

They don't have to buy it, but they'll most certainly envy those who have.",1136592000,,1239,4.730232558139535
2413978,4,B000BC8T1E,"I love all the Twilight Zones and was thrilled that I could get them on dvd but I hate the fact that there is no PLAY ALL option on any of these sets 'cuz I really would love my own marathon instead of having to turn on each one individually. But oh well.. great series, worth it for sure :)",1136505600,8,291,3.8666666666666667
2413979,5,B000BC8T1E,"It's a real shame that The Twilight Zone didn't go beyond a 5th season.  I have been a die-hard fan of the show when it was popular as a rerun in the 1980s.  Personally, season 5 was my favorite of the Twilight Zone.

To me there were many underrated classics in this season: ""You Drive,"" ""Night Call,"" ""An Occurance At Owl Creek Bridge"" (actually this episode is a French film.  The story was written by Ambrose Bierce), ""What's in The Box,"" ""Stopover In A Quiet Town"" and the rare non-syndicated episode ""The Encounter.""  It also includes the more well-known classics: ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet,"" ""Mr. Garrity And The Graves,"" ""The Masks"" and ""Living Doll.""

There are also some great bonus features including a 90-minute in-depth documentary about the life of Rod Serling titled ""Submitted For Your Approval.""

Also included are audio commentary with some of the stars like Martin Landau (The Jeopardy Room), Mickey Rooney (The Last Night Of A Jockey), Bill Mumy (Praise Of Pip) and Alan Sues (The Masks).  Interviews with Rod Serling; remastered picture and sound for superior quality and much, much more.
