8064446,4,B0009P1YZ6,"For a long time, I thought there were only three old tv shows that held up for modern viewers: Perry Mason, Star Trek, and Have Gun -- Will Travel.  (Yes, I've watched Twilight Zone recently.  I loved it, and watched every show, when it was on the air.  Now it bores the hell out of me.)  The Third Man is a strong contender for another old tv show that can still be watched with pleasure today.",1421884800,,395,4.157894736842105
8064447,4,B0009P1YZ6,"This is a series of short programs that are loosely based on the 1949 movie of the same name. The T.V. series uses the same theme music as the movie. We only get 10 of the 72 episodes. Someone is holding back.

1. The Third Medallion
  It was surprising to see all the actors as you watch the story unfold. At first they will over power the characters they are playing. Given the nature of the show I should have planned on Werner Klemperer.

Watch as Harry pulls a rabbit out of the hat at the last moment to wrap up the mystery.

2. A Pocketful of Sin
  By now we realize that Jonathan Harris is with us to stay as Lime's assistant Bradford Webster. He makes all the faces and jesters that you found him in ""Lost in Space."" This review would be too long if I were to identify all the almost fifty recognizable actors in the series. Some very phony French accents.

Tricky ending but not that tricky as you are thinking.

The balance if the programs are technically the same formula. If you enjoyed the first two episodes you will enjoy the balance.

8064448,3,B0009P1YZ6,"It's probably best to disassociate Carol Reed's classic 1949 film ""The Third Man"" from this late Fifties/early Sixties syndicated television series of the same name that starred Michael Rennie as Harry Lime, the role originated by Orson Welles in the film.  The tone and texture of the series is much lighter than the film and the basic premise, that Harry Lime is a flawed man who tries to right the wrongs of the world, is far removed from the Lime character of the film.  Anton Karas' memorable theme music is the only real carryover from the film.  That said, the series is enjoyable on its own terms and those who enjoy the Roger Moore series ""The Saint"" will see more obvious comparisons with that series than with the film.  Jonathan Harris, prior to his role as ""Dr. Zachary Smith"" in ""Lost in Space"" appears in some of the episodes as Lime's assistant Brad Webster.

This is a rare series to see and hasn't been broadcast in decades but, unfortunately, this 4-episode DVD doesn't do the show much justice.  The source material used for this release are unrestored syndication prints, so while they are certainly watchable, you'll encounter the occasional splice and audio dropout, and there are film speckles from time to time.  The DVD says that this is ""Volume 1,"" but this DVD has been available since 2004 and there's never been any follow-up release to date.  One wishes for an official studio release of this series but, given its age and the fact that it was filmed in black & white, that's probably unrealistic.",1150761600,19,1528,4.739622641509434
