294374,5,6300274268,"An amazing adaptation of Lewis Carroll's work. It has such a surreal and dreamlike progression, it seems to float through a stream of consciousness. Definitely one of my favorite Disney films. (Even more Surreal at times  then Dumbo's Pink Elephants and Pooh's Hephalumps and Woozils)""  Top-notch voice characterizations from  Richard Haydn(Caterpillar), Ed  Wynn(Madd-Hatter), Jerry Colonna(MarchHare), Bill Thompson(White  Rabbit/Dodo), JPat OMalley(Tweedles, Walrus&Carpenter) and Sterling  Holloway(Cheshire Cat.",926553600,2,516,6.861538461538461
294375,5,6300274268,"Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful video for all ages! Unlike some Disney movies that can be frightening for some younger children, Alice is a great story for everyone. The Mad Hatter and the Walrus and Carpenter are great!  The poetry is timeless, too. I would highly recommend this to everyone and  anyone! Enjoy!",920678400,,315,4.814814814814815
294556,2,6300274268,"They often tell you ""there may be a small delay"" when switching layers on dual-layer discs, but that's never been an issue for me. This time it was. Every time the movie, a featurette, or even the previews end, the disc srruggles to find its footing and ends up unresponsive. I tried three times just to watch the movie. I'd recommend getting an older DVD edition or try the 65th anniversary edition if you're in the Disney Movie Club",1523750400,,434,4.506329113924051

Im sure if you enjoy this movie , then youll love this Blu Ray edition ! The animation is so crisp and the sound quality is sublime  . Disney really knows how to restore their classics .

294685,3,6300274268,"I have a daughter who is curious about the Alice In Wonderland story & characters, so I thought this would be a good movie for us all to watch on family movie night. The DVDs themselves were in brand new perfect condition & played perfectly on our DVD/Blueray player, but the movie itself was not really one I could say I liked, the story itself was rather strange. I just don't understand what makes it such a classic since it doesn't really have much of a story itself...it just seems like a weird pointless dream Alice has & not really much else, but then again, I had never read the book Alice In Wonderland either, so maybe if I had read it before watching the movie, that might have made more sense to me, but I'm not so sure I want to...the way the characters interacted most of the time with each other in this movie seemed rather rude & negative. On the plus side, the movie itself was colorful, bright & clear as was the sound, and it kept both of my daughter's attention. There were some scenes in the movie they found amusing & made them laugh... they seemed to enjoy it, so that was good... they liked the characters of the Cheshire Cat & the White Rabbit best. I am giving it 3 stars because while I didn't really care for this particular movie, it kept my kids entertained & the DVDs themselves played perfectly. I am considering getting the movie version of AIW starring Johnny Depp....I really like him as an actor & maybe that one will be more enjoyable for me....although I will have to watch it first before I decide whether I will have my daughters watch it.",1516147200,,1579,4.374149659863946

295316,4,6300274268,"ALICE IN WONDERLAND is another great classic Disney movie now in Blu-ray + DVD and at a great price for the 2-Disc 60th Anniversary Version. My only disappointment was that it did not not include the Digital HD Version also, as many of the Disney classics now include as a part of the package set.  Still a great buy at $9.99 for the 2-Disc Blu-ray + DVD set of this Disney classic.  Would Recommend purchase even without the Digital Version, although that would make it a 5-Star in my opinion.",1489276800,7,494,4.477777777777778

295346,3,6300274268,"I love the film.  The Special Features are not so special.  The documentary about the Disney/Carroll connection/making of the film is less than enthralling.  There's an annoying, split-screen throughout its length, one side is various animators, Disney people, and Carroll scholars holding forth (which is interesting, overall), and the other side is a manically edited montage of clips from the film.  Non-Stop.  It truly is headache inducing, at least for me.  And BTW, Kathryn Beaumont appears for all of 20 seconds, introducing the doc, and later for another 10 seconds, introducing an old clip of her, as a child, working on the film and enacting a scene for the animators to follow, which lasts about 30 seconds.  And the DVD menu, as with all Disney ""Anniversary"" DVDs, is problematic, confusing, often freezing, and often malfunctioning.",1487548800,3,845,5.214814814814815

295348,4,6300274268,"This Disney classic follows young Alice after she falls down a rabbit hole into the magical world of Wonderland, where there is no logic but everything makes sense. On her journey she encounters a talking white rabbit, singing flowers, and a mad queen (just to name a few). Alice is a bit timid (this was made in 1951, so it fits the time) and sometimes you just want her to get up and do something about the situations she end up in - which is why I prefer the live-action Disney version, but this one is still a classic.",1487289600,2,522,4.282828282828283

It's an odd, disconcerting film, but that's to be expected given the source. Should children watch it? Sure, as they are likely to understand as much as adults would.

While not entirely my cup of tea, it's hard to deny the film's quality.",1486598400,,430,4.958333333333333

the plot

Alice, a British blonde preteen grows both restless and bored as she endures a history lesson from her older sister outside, under a tree on this beautiful summer's day. Instead of even pretending to try learning anything, Alice retorts to her sister Mathilda's lessons on logic with meaningless jibber-jabber. Alice begins to daydream of a world of her own where nothing really makes sense and chaos rules.

Interrupting her thoughts was a worried white rabbit who was looking at his pocket watch, running by exclaiming verbally that he was indeed late. But, late for what? Alice was aiming to find out. She followed a rabbit to a rabbit hole, where when she leaned over too far she fell into it. She fell for a long time, and at about halfway down, the rules and laws were beginning to change before her eyes. She ended up in an enchanted forest, which mirrored her fantasy of just a few moments ago.

Her main goal was to find the white rabbit to find out where he was going, yet on the way she met an odd set of twins, a talking doorknob, a smoking caterpillar, a walrus, a carpenter, another rabbit called March Hare, the Mad Hatter, and of course the Cheshire Cat. All of these colorful characters ultimately are never helpful to Alice. She becomes quickly disenchanted with this enchanted forest and she attempts to find her way back home. Yet the forest and its inhabitants may have other plans. Will Alice be able to escape the dangers of this insane place? Find out when you watch Disney's classic 1951 version of Alice in Wonderland.

the breakdown

It seems that Walt Disney has had a love of this story for a long time before this animated classic was finally realized. Most of his early works from the mid-1920s were focused on producing the silent short films called Alice Comedies. In fact, before Mickey Mouse made his debut in 1928, Walt's main focus was on these classic shorts that revolve the idea of Lewis Carroll's characters and books. When the unheard of idea of creating full-length animated features arose, Walt must have thought of Alice right away. Different ideas were considered for taking on Alice in Wonderland, including using the model he created for the Alice Comedies where a live action actress was used for Alice surrounded by a world based in animation. In fact, it went through a bunch of ideas before they started the serious work on it. I for one am thankful for the many unforeseen delays, as I absolutely love the fully animated version.

This is perhaps one of the most colorful features from Walt Disney Studios. Just about every one of the odd characters Alice runs into wears a different color from the last one encountered, which makes it visually interesting. The different characters Alice meets on her way to locate the white rabbit results in a consecutive series of short stories, which I think would normally ruin a movie, but here it works somehow to witness a bunch of short cartoons that make up this film. The idea of this chaotic and illogical world of Wonderland seems to be complimented by the format.

Kathryn Beaumont provided the voice for Alice, which was an adequate fit. Beaumont was around twelve years old when she portrayed Alice, plus her proper British accent with perfect diction had all the right qualifications for this film, another British-based story that Walt Disney Productions decided to undertake around this time. Ed Wynn's distinctive voice was a perfect fit for the zany Mad Hatter. Sterling Holloway, a veteran Disney actor even by this date stole the show by many viewers as the mystical Cheshire Cat. Holloway's distinctive voice is synonymous with Walt Disney classic animation.

There are some dark subject matters within Alice in Wonderland. For instance, the Walrus and the Carpenter story where the two scheme to lead a school of child oysters to their nasty death where the hungry Walrus gobbles them all up. The caterpillar character is seen constantly smoking some strange substance. Although we're not sure of what the main ingredient is, we have to assume it grows wild in this forest, possibly making everyone else here loopy as well. Of course, we can't forget the Queen of Hearts who only wants to chop off Alice's head for some meaningless crime.

Clearly Alice In Wonderland is visually engaging, but unlike most other Disney classics, this film is lacking any real memorable songs. It hampers the rewatchability factor a bit, and very rarely will you find any Alice tunes on the Disney compilation CDs. Also with the absence of any real good songs, kids may not have the patience to sit through the whole film. Having said that, the Mad Hatter scene with the ""Very Merry Unbirthday"" song never fails to please.

blu-ray features-

Bonus Features:
 Backstage Disney- Through the Keyhole: A Companion's Guide to Wonderland, Reference Footage: Alice and the Doorknob, Pencil Test: Alice Shrinks

Through the Keyhole gives the chance to watch the film with a unique type of commentary given by Brian Sibley (a Lewis Carroll and Walt Disney historian), Charles Solomon (animation critic and historian) Morton Cohen (Victorian Literature specialist) Daniel Singer (Disney Imagineer) and Paula Sigmond (Disney historian). While the film is seen at all times, and heard in the background, you see either the people given commentary, or illustrations and/or pictures of Lewis Carroll and his history mostly. They share stories and history of Lewis Carroll and his writings especially this story. After watching ""through this keyhole"" it would be hard not to be impressed with Carroll's life and works. Not only was he a natural story teller, but he was a mathematician, clergyman and a pioneer within photography. The commentary naturally leads into the story of how Walt Disney's interest in the Alice Stories led to the silent short films of the Alice Comedies. Everyone should take at least one time around viewing this beautiful high definition documentary of Lewis Carroll/Walt Disney and the development of Alice in Wonderland. 76 minutes

Reference Footage: Alice and the Doorknob is hosted by Kathryn Beaumont herself. This is a quick documentary showing pictures and video of herself acting out onstage for the animators to copy her action while conversing with the doorknob. In hi-def. 1:33 minutes

Pencil Test is again hosted by Kathryn Beaumont. A very short, newly discovered animated pencil sketch of Alice shrinking next to the doorknob. 1 minute.

The Family Play section consists of two features. One is the original 1 minute Christmas time introduction to the TV airing of Alice in Wonderland. Amazingly, we hear Walt himself, back in 1959 mention future Disney classics like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast that were made years after his death.

Games and Activities has an addictive game called Painting the Roses Red. A puzzle game in where you have to move the paintbrush around the block of first nine, then sixteen, then finally 25 roses and paint the roses red with your remote. Actually, I'm not sure if 25 roses is the largest, because I couldn't get passed that level.

Then they thoughtfully  included the classic DVD bonus features which includes I'm Odd, a newly discovered song sung by the Cheshire Cat. Sadly this is not presented in hi-def. Yet, thankfully the Mickey Mouse short Thru the Looking Glass is in hi-def.

The jewel of these features is the one hour special from 1950 named One Hour In Wonderland. It's the full length Christmas special that features Kathryn Beaumont as Alice, Walt Disney, his two daughters, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Mickey Mouse, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Magic Mirror, Donald Duck, Uncle Remus, Goofy and more. This also may be the closest that most of us will see the cartoon shorts from Song of the South featuring Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear.  This is also presented in high definition, although naturally full screen.

All of these hours and hours of bonus features make this blu-ray the definitive guide to everything that has to do with Disney's version of Alice In Wonderland. This set also comes with a DVD version as well.

They seem to think it was a factory error on Disney's part. I was still hesitant to order a replacement, but did anyway after the wonderful lady on the phone said they would take it back if it happened again. The new DVD arrived in two days, fully intact, both disks and works perfectly. Glad to have this Disney classic as a part of my children's collection.

I'm so disappointed! What a rip off! I purchased the ""2 Disc Special Edition"", and there's only one DVD. And to top it off, it's the bonus material, not even the actual movie. Will be returning.",1460160000,5,681,4.448

My only gripe is not with the movie but with the presentation:

I purchased (via prime) to play this a portion of this movie to my elementary class (as we're reading the novel as a class). The video played well full screen if I wasn't moving the mouse or making the bar (showing how much time has passed/is left). When the bottom bar was visible (by mouse movement or spacebar press or other) there was an annoying bar on the left side showing advertisements. It may have been to other amazon movies or sites, but given they had to do with Lewis Carroll (and sported some odd pictures and images) made it so next time I plan to play a movie in my class (or purchase for home use) I'll purchase the actual DVD. Advertisement bars anytime you want to watch a movie which you have purchased are very saddening and lead me to not purchase any more movies online because of the intrusion.",1459209600,,985,4.4972067039106145

296522,5,6300274268,"Alice isn't considered(at least by Disney) to be in their 1st tier of Disney Animated Movies, and I don't understand why.  Alice is very comparable to other movies that Disney considers Diamond, platinum, masterpiece, or whatever.

1.  The Animation:  I love the animation of this movie.  Alice with Peter Pan mark for me the beauty of what ink and paint can do in the most classical sense.  The colors are vibrant, and the characters are wonderfully drawn.

2.  The story:  Disney does a great job of capturing the absolute madness of this story.  Some would say the plot makes no sense, and I'd say....exactly.

3.  The voice talents:  Disney had an incredible stable of talent from Ed Wynn, Sterling Holloway, J. Pat O'Malley, Thurl Ravenscroft, Mel Blanc,
and the voice of Alice is Kathryn Beaumont, who was also the voice of Wendy in Peter Pan.

The Movie I think deserves more respect than Disney gives it, it's a true masterpiece",1456272000,5,936,4.76875

296654,5,6300274268,"This movie has been my Disney favorite since I was a kid and still to this day I can watch it and still feel the same enjoyment like when I was a kid. I think this is one of those Disney movies that can still reach kids of this generation and you do not need new graphic designs for it. Now when kid shows that are Disney related are revamped they have this new graphic design which is really odd and very 3D like. I do not personally like, however, I find some older Disney movies kids might not like because the graphic shift over the years.

However, I think movies like Alice in Wonderland and Mulan are movies that graphics wise are still very rich and grab everyone's attention. Alice is such a great Disney movie because of the randomness of it all. The witty craziness of the characters and how it all comes together in weird ways. As a kid it's very entertaining and makes you want to live in Alice's world. I know I did!

My little cousin loves Frozen and Tangled just like any kids right now but she also has said to me about how much she loves Alice in Wonderland. I find it's really nice to see people still giving the older movies a chance and they can really stand up next to movies coming out now,I think. Alice is uplifting and adventurous. It's also dark and intriguing. It's everything you want in a story playing out in front of you.",1452988800,4,1353,4.260700389105058

296821,5,6300274268,"I always loved this movie as a child. Now I am a parent of two little kids, ages 6 and 4, and am writing this review with them in mind.  I realize that there are over a thousand reviews on here already but what the heck...

We borrowed Alice from the library today at my insistence and they watched it this evening. This was the first time my children had seen it. I wasn't able to watch the entire movie with them but I watched bits and pieces.  They loved it so much. They laughed out loud at all the silliness, including Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, how they bump into each other and make noises while doing so.  The soundtrack is excellent and its excellence goes well beyond just the music.  All the little ways sound is used to enhance the animation and the Wonderland experience are simply wonderful.  I had forgotten just how tight this movie is with all of the amazing details.

Unlike many other Disney movies, Alice in Wonderland is not scary or traumatic for very little children.  There really isn't anything terrifying to little kids in it.  There is the general off-kilterness which was slightly upsetting to my four-year old at first until she started laughing her head off at all the ridiculousness.  I reassured her that the movie is just silly and Alice turns out just fine.  By comparison, my mom left me on my own to watch Bambi when I was five and I think I spent the whole time crying in a corner.  Snow White is terrifying because of the evil stepmother and the poisoned apple.  Ditto for Sleeping Beauty.  The scariest thing about this one is the Queen of Hearts but she is so ridiculous it is hard to be genuinely scared.  In fact, my six-year old son thought the belligerent Queen was the funniest part because she was so ridiculous.

They loved the mad hatter and the Un-Birthday party, of course.  Every time I poked my head in to see what was going on in the movie, I was reminded of how intelligent and imaginative it is. The animation is amazing, the characters are great, the soundtrack is great, there are wonderful silly ideas everywhere and all sorts of character types.

After it was over, my son (the 6 year old) told me how much he loved this exciting movie.  I could tell he found it truly inspiring and that's just about all any of us hope for from a movie!  I seriously feel like this movie is perfection for a kids' movie.  I don't see how it could be improved upon!",1450569600,,2409,4.404977375565611

(Screaming and crying) they said she wants Alice in Wonderland. I grabbed my phone found the movie in about 10 sec rented it. By this time the little one was put in another room to calm down. I started the movie and walked up to her and said, hey nugget. Here I got this for you. She looked at my phone, still crying, stops abruptly smiles the biggest smile I've ever seen and said. THANKS!!! Layed down and watch the movie. Needless to say. This movie, one of my favorites, and Amazon Prime saved the night. ",1448064000,,670,4.275590551181103

Charming and cute characters in a fast paced adventure. There isn't a lot of drama or loss and love, love lost, death and all the other drama of Disney movies, so this is a true G in my opinion. Suitable for all ages and emotional capabilities. Unlike some other G movies like Bambi, Dumbo and the Fox and the Hound. Good Grief, that one still haunts me!",1447113600,,484,4.271739130434782

297012,1,6300274268,"Not Disney's greatest work (or even close). Animation was so-so and the story line is extremely hard to follow for a child. Musical scores: not good. Disney also took way too many liberties with twisting the original Lewis Carroll  book and his characters, I'm sure that Carroll was turning in his grave when this movie was released.  Don't watch this movie - make some time in your evening to READ the original Alice in Wonderland story book to your child!

My four year old only saw 30 minutes of the movie, and random parts at that, the first few times. Why keep selling it? It was very aggravating. Now that we can watch it in Blu-Ray, it plays like a dream. The picture is also crisper and the colors are more vibrant.",1430870400,2,522,4.1683168316831685

298350,5,6300274268,"Well, it's nice to finally meet you.
I've been waiting for your call.
I've noticed you've been crying,
And, I've watched you pace the halls.

Whatever has been hurting you,
I can make it disappear.
You know you have nothing to lose,
Nothing to live for, nothing to fear.

Thank you, for your invention.
I'll be sure not to leave your side.
We'll become very fast acquainted.
My naive child, there's no use trying to hide.

I should probably introduce myself.
I am your very own addiction.
But, you can not be angry with me.
I am you own self-conviction.

I bet you feel rather stupid,
Falling right into my lap.
I'm a master at manipulation.
You'll never escape my trap.

How does it feel to dance with the Devil?
For he and I are one in the same.
God, has completely abandoned you,
So, you might as well stay in the game.

Are you honestly going to try and beat me?
A useless battle if you want to know.
Go ahead and make an attempt.
Besides, I'm in the mood for a good show.

I guess, you think your special.
But, your sobriety has only lasted a year.
I'm still around every corner,
In the back of your mind
I'm your greatest fear.

I'll always be your dirty little secret.
I won't disappear over time.
Twenty years from now you may falter,
And, I'll be the first thing that comes to mind.

A vicious cycle, that's what your thinking,
But, I'm only speaking the truth.
I'm Satin's weapon of mass destruction.
The silent killer of America's youth.

It's genius when you think of it.
Everyone's looking for some Armageddon war.
But, what the fools don't realize,
Is everyday Armageddon walks through their front door",1425945600,73,1616,4.447457627118644

298649,5,6300274268,"Somehow, this was the first time I had seen the original Disney version of Alice in Wonderland. I really don't know how that is possible, but as I was watching it, I kept thinking, Ive never seen this before.

Disneys Alice is a very fun, albeit frustrating romp through Wonderland, though it still retains the creepiness of the original story, even though it is for kids. Because its quite a bit shorter, Alice doesnt encounter as many of the inhabitants of Wonderland as she does in other versions. But all the important ones are there: The Mad Tea Party, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, and Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee, among others.

The animation is in the lovely vein that Disney had going in the 50s and 60s, similar to Sleeping Beauty and 101 Dalmatians. Its a bit more whimsical and soft than those two, but theres something so pretty about it that I wish Disney would bring back. Wonderland is extremely colorful, of course, and the art is zany and fun to go along with the insane inhabitants. The script is clever and seamless, with Alice wandering through the place and running into character after character.

I so appreciate that Alice gets frustrated. She sits down and cries a few times; shes what, 11? I don't remember her exact age, but I can imagine that being in that situation would be frustrating. I also love that she is so sassy in this version; she actually felt like a real little girl. In other versions, its sort of like, oh look, strange things are happening. Ok.

Not this version. Shes a sassy little British kid that is not taking any of Wonderlands nonsense.

And she still happens to be adorable and ladylike as well.

Just as with all the old Disney movies, songs are blended into the script, creating charming musical scenes that sometimes Alice participates in and sometimes shes trying to get away from. Of course, everyones favorite scene (dont lie), happens to be the Mad Tea Party, where The Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse all sing A Very Merry Unbirthday, though perhaps what makes this scene so adorable are the tea pots chiming the instrumental bits.

There are many numbers like this one throughout the movie, giving it that adorable, classic Disney feel.

If you're a fan of Alice in Wonderland, you cant go wrong with this classic Disney version. It is perhaps a little simpler and less inclusive, but it is charming and whimsical, and a joy to watch. A great addition to your movie library.

298726,4,6300274268,"Based on the Lewis Carroll novel, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a highly strange movie about a weird dream Alice has after she falls asleep. Depending on where she is and what she eats, she shrinks or grows, and while on her journey she runs into an assortment of odd characters she interacts with. This movie is entertaining but a bit complicated unless you've read the book. Certainly a movie the kids can appreciate.",1421625600,,414,4.684931506849315

299158,5,6300274268,"In 1945, Disney hired Aldous Huxley to re-write and already beleaguered script for Alice in Wonderland.  He ended up scrapping the famous author's work because it was ""too much of a literal adaptation of Carroll's book"" and one can't have a faithful adaptation when one is Disney.  Naturally, he played fast and loose with the two books, smashing them together as only Disney would.  It's not as though Carroll was going to sue him from the grave.  When first released in 1951, fans of Carroll's books accused Disney of ""Americanizing"" a great work of English literature.  The film did not do well, earning about $2.4 million.  It's speculated that one of the reasons it failed was due to inconsistency, having had five directors vying to outdo each other with the segments they were assigned.  Disney said it failed ""because Alice had no heart.""  Oddly enough, it was rediscovered during the 60s by college students who related it to acid trips.  Shocked, the Disney Company refused to issue prints of the film to universities until 1974, when Alice in Wonderland was rereleased in theaters.  Belatedly, people now consider this to be one of Disney's finest achievements in animation.

My first introduction to this film was on television, in black and white, sometime after Christmas, eons ago.  I love the silliness of the characters, the swift pace, and the songs.  I've learned to live with the liberties they took with the books.  Every once in awhile I trot it out for another viewing.",1416787200,,1492,4.892430278884462

299218,5,6300274268,"It is a tribute to this version of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is better known than the 21 other film versions which have already been made, including the recent pastiche in 2010, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp.

The story is relatively true to Carroll's novel, but some things are left out and some things, for the sake of music, have been added. The film creates an entirely new aesthetic,  in contrast to John Tenniell's original black and white, pen and ink drawings.  Disney's Cheshire cat, White Rabbit, Mad Tea Party, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, caterpillar, and Alice herself have replaced Tenniell's images in the popular imagination.

This is done at the height of the Disney studio's conventional animation technique, released between Cinderella and Peter Pan. At the time, the technique was vastly superior to TV animation, except for the shorts which began as material for the big screen. I watched this film a few days ago, after buying the DVD, and my impression is that the animation is almost as good as Disney's best, but it seems to lack the subtitles I see in Bambi or Fantasia.

But, after 64 years, the film holds its own and charms me one more time. This may be the best Alice worth buying, even if you could find the older ones on DVD or even tape.",1416009600,12,1297,4.6960352422907485

299318,5,6300274268,"Color and music bring this reworked tale from Lewis Carroll to life.

""Alice in Wonderland"" is a 1951 film from Walt Disney Animation Studios.
It follows a young 10 year old named Alice (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) and her curiosity. One minute she's falling down a rabbit hole next thing you know she's singing with a bunch of beautiful but rude flowers. Ed Wynn, Sterling Holloway, J. Pat O'Malley and Verna Felton also star in this charming classic.

What makes this movie stand out is the colors and the music. Characters are great you have a charming Mad Hatter and a tempermental queen.

Despite the bad reputation it earned in the '70s because it was bootlegged and shown at campuses where students were high on LSD or other drugs, it reminds us of a time where the world was innocent.

I find it to be a cute movie and unlike most Disney's that have subtle PG content this one is more friendly for children under 6 years of age.

I highly recommend it, great for the whole family.",1412640000,,988,4.52808988764045

There's some parts I don't remember, like Alice sitting in a field of flowers singing or how she visits the white rabbit's house. But it didn't take away from the magical experience that I remember. Yes, I had heard about the drugs joke and while it does seem tripped out, it's not the only film that has whacked out proportions. Take Dumbo with the whole pink elephants thing. Now that seemed like people were on drugs while creating that movie. Anyway, back on topic, I loved the special features and I think it has been the most special features I have seen in a Disney movie.

299582,5,6300274268,"Walt didn't like ""Alice"" according to Wikipedia anyway. He thought she was ""boring"", and indeed she is because Alice is the STRAIGHTMAN/GIRL! All the madcap zaniness happens TO Alice! She is the foil, the Abbot to the insane world populated with the Costellos of Wonderland. Think of all the characters that have become part of Western culture: the Hatter and Hare, the Cheshire Cat, Tweedledee and Dum, the Red Queen; they are the ones that make the show. Alice is a quite proper little English girl whom most assiduously seeks to always do the right and  virtuous thing  as opposed to the anarchy that surrounds her as she makes her way thru Wonderland. If she was as crazy as the rest it simply would not work. Alice is a delight! I have all the Disney animated movies from Snow White to Sleeping Beauty and Alice is my favorite as an enjoyable viewing experience. Snow White and Pinocchio are the pinnacle of animation art, Alice falls short there (as do all the others), but so what? It is still top drawer, as far as I am concerned it took Disney 60 years to equal it in hand drawn animation with The Princess And The Frog. Let me also say this: no other studio produces BDs with the uncanny PERFECTION of Disney. Everyone of my BDs is an utter delight. $18 for this classic on Blu ray is a steal. I watch Alice once a month and she never fails to put a big smile on my face all the way thru. I wish more parents would forgo all the lame Grrrrl Power dreck that Disney produced in the last 20 years and buy classic Disney for themselves and their children.",1403395200,,1562,4.401384083044983

There is a wealth of extra material for the Disneyphile (I guess I qualify).  They do an excellent job of packaging these classics.  I'm glad I got this one.  I've stayed with my non Blue-ray Snow White and Fantasia for ""purists"" sake but this, being a ""modern classic"" deserves the treatment it got.",1399334400,,417,4.581081081081081

299608,5,6300274268,"I just love this movie, and I consider it to be the best Disney cartoon of all time. It is colourful, and its tone is warm, but the most of the characters are not too friendly to Alice - and it is such a wonderful contrast. And so many great, beautiful songs!
I love the Queen, the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit and all the rest of them. I love the Tulgey Wood scenes, for they are suddenly so dark, the sad song about a very good advice that Alice sings is so wonderful.
Of course, the tea party scene is so great too! And the Queen of Hearts is so funny. The story of the Walrus and the Carpenter is, maybe, a little too long, but it is worthy anyway because of the acting and the dancing of the Walrus.
Wonderful, just wonderful cartoon. I heard that Walt Disney himself said that he didn't like it - and if it's true, I really don't know why. So much wonderful work was put into this film.
""Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there?
I wonder where...""

On the DVD the picture quality is great, and the remastered audio track sounds very good to me - especially the songs. There is also the original mono audio track for the film available on this DVD.

Some of the bonus materials are really good, but some are not. My favourite additional materials are:
1. ""From Wonderland To Never Land"", in which a very beautiful song called ""Beyond the Laughing Sky"" is featured
2. ""Operation Wonderland"" - a behind-the-scenes video
3. ""The Fred Waring Show"" - live action play of Alice in Wonderland featuring appearences of Kathryn Beaumont and Sterling Holloway in their original roles from the cartoon
But there are a few disappointments among the bonus materials. First, the Virtual Wonderland Party is just awful. It has simple none of the spirit of Alice in Wonderland film. And also there is a ""set top game"" - it is clearly made with much effort, but the game itself, sadly, is not interesting at all.",1398556800,,1946,4.417827298050139

299782,4,6300274268,"I actually genuinely liked this movie, both as child and growing up. Regardless of what critics say I don't think this movie was a ""minor"" Disney film, in fact it has its own section in the Cinderella's Castle area of Disney land, with rides and a shop dedicated to just it.

As a child my mother only let me watch this movie on special occasions because of the Caterpillar doing opium, however I had no idea at 5 what that was. I feel one of the reasons critics didn't like this movie was because it was so ahead of its time, and willing to show things that the area was no ready to see.

We start with Alice following the white rabbit who is ""late, late for a very important date."" In this version we go down the rabbit whole with him. Some retelling stories of Alice discuss the looking glass because the story of Alice in Wonderland refers to a series of Alice books, not all of which I have read, but most of them I have, they are little harder to find because they are older novels, but only one is a classic.

Here we meet Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb. Two characters who annoy me, however they make a huge impression upon the audience, and so much so that my other called my brother and I by those names when we were being to rambunctious as children. My favorite part of the movie happens after this, the song and story about the eating of the sea food. I laugh and I cry.

We continue on throughout the story on the trail and meet many an amazing character. From talking flowers that cannot guess her name, to cookies that make you grow and shrink, and to a Caterpillar that does hallucinogenics and wants to know who she is.

We also see some very important characters such as the Red Queen and The Mad Hatter who are (and no offence to Johnny Depp I love him so much) much closer to the novelization versions the story is based upon here then in the more current movie. We also meet my favorite character, the Cheshire Cat.

It is a great movie that is fun and fresh. It does feel like a dream, or an acid trip (at least how I assume one would feel). Still, it is a fun family movie that will give you a much needed break from life.",1387238400,,2144,4.204379562043796

299879,5,6300274268,"Disney Studios 13th full length animated feature film is also their most bizarre offering. Walt Disney had Alice in Wonderland in his sights for years before this film was made. Starting with his Alice shorts, the live action little girl placed in a cartoon. It's wouldn't be until after the war and the success of Cinderella before he would see his vision brought to screen.

The Blu Ray looks great with colors popping all over the place, the film has never looking this good in any other release to date. This really brings out Mary Blair's color conceptions and vision. I personally never saw the fascination with this film and viewing the Blu Ray was probably only my third or forth time seeing it in my lifetime. It's a beautiful looking film in this format, but the chaotic nature of the story grows tiresome for me. It's a personal choice, I'm not condemning the film in any way and it still deserves the title of ""classic"" because of it's innovative style and incredible animation.

The extras are very good, but of course we have the exclusions from previous releases yet again, overall this is a very satisfying release. The story is simple, the characters and songs are memorable. It's no wonder this is a fan favorite.

If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.",1376438400,,1306,4.620689655172414

299918,1,6300274268,"There's no doubt that this is a very good movie for the entire family.

If so, why would Disney prevent you from watching your digital movie on more than one monitor simultaneously?

I have a dual monitor graphics card; at first I couldn't figure out why the Disney movies wouldn't play on any of my two monitors. Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played. Presto, I realized later on that when I have both monitors connected to my graphics card Disney has fixed so that you and I cannot watch the digital movie, we paid big bucks for, on two monitors at the same time via your computer. I have many other digital movies from Universal, Warner etc. and they all play whether or not I have one or two monitors plugged into my graphics card.

So beware. If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual-monitor graphics card and say one day you and your family decide to watch Snow White but you and your wife want to watch it in the bedroom and the kids in their room--forget it--it's not going to happen. Why did Disney do this? Control? They don't believe you own it?

Whatever the reason, it's not good for business.",1370822400,,1208,4.355555555555555

299954,5,6300274268,"I am so tired, frankly, of all the ""heroines"" in children's films.  I mean, where are characters that are kids I can identify with, kids that sound like kids and act like kids?  Sure I was sometimes ""brave"" and ""fearless"" as a child, but not always!  I wish Disney would stop making that a ""requirement"" for all female characters.  I mean, enough already, we aren't all Joan of Arc, and even then not always.

I happened to chance upon this playing a few weeks ago on Disney, and I absolutely fell in love with Alice and this story!  It has a perfect blend of almost scary oddness, even bordering on insanity, like Lewis Carroll's story itself, but, thanks to the era this was made, it does NOT go over the top and leave you or your child freaked out.  I thought the dialogue was excellent, and the characters all adorable, even when they are being a little ""freaky"".  That's the charm of the story!  But it is Alice herself, that I just loved.  She has a believable and charming amount of pluckiness alternating with just plain fear and sadness.  (who wouldn't?)  When she breaks down and cries at her plight, I felt it tug my heartstrings, it was just 'real' sounding.

After Mowgli and the Jungle Book characters, 101 Dalmations, this is now one of my Disney favorites, and Alice is one of my favorite characters of all time.  I highly recommend!  Girls especially, will like Alice in Wonderland.",1364601600,,1399,4.562248995983936
299955,1,6300274268,"I can't believe this is a children's movie. It must have been a joke. I thought it was a cute movie at first.  The little girl seemed so real and life-like.
(I am going to give my review based on how a child would view this movie.) Due to her curiosity, Alice fell into a rabbit's hole, which seemed like a 150 story building as she floated to the bottom.  She drank a mysterious drink (from a stranger) or a potion that by today's standards could have been poison. She talked to and followed a stranger or a large bunny rabbit (i think?) Then she put something or a cookie in her mouth and ate it to become large again.  She cried huge tears due to home sick and flooded the whole room and her self.  Next she drank from the potion bottle again and became tiny to get in a tiny bottle and float safely or survive the flood.
I found the movie traumatic and scary as I witnessed from the point of view of a small child.  A little girl was in danger and no one was around to help.  This movie would need adult supervision if little children watched.  So many truths would have to be taught such as stranger danger, don't talk to strangers, don't eat or drink things that a stranger gives you, it could be drugs or poison, don't run away from home or leave the home without a parent, you could get hurt and everyone is not nice. It would also be overwhelming for small children to watch a Alice cry the enormous tears she cried.  She was in so much distress and no adult was around to soothe, calm or listen to her. Lastly, this movie is for adult supervision only.  One must not assume a child will not take it seriously.  If Alice, a child was afraid, little children watching her will be also.
I gave this movie one star because it is marketed for children and it crosses so many limits that are unacceptable for children to watch.  And it sends too many wrong messages that are not good for the safety of children. I do not find it entertaining to see a child in distress or doing things that can bring her harm. We have enough of that in real life.",1364601600,4,2050,4.204081632653061

300033,5,6300274268,"For material that does not lend itself very easily to cinema, this is a good adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" with some enjoyable characters and sequences. It succeeds, at least in a basic way, in capturing part of the manic but imaginative nature of Lewis Carroll's story.

Much of the language, poetry, and ideas that make the original story so captivating cannot really be conveyed very easily in a movie, and so it would be nearly impossible for any cinema version of Alice to be completely satisfying to those who love the book. Instead, this version simply tries to make the characters come to life, and to use the animation to recreate the feel, if not the depth, of Alice's experience.

The animation drives most of the movie, and at times it is pretty imaginative. Some of the voices work very well, too, with the likes of Ed Wynn and Sterling Holloway fitting the animated characters quite well.

Carroll's stories are so enchanting and creative that it is no surprise that there have been so many efforts through the years to capture the magic of the Alice stories on film. None of the cinema versions has yet come close to matching the books, yet the material itself has made most of them worth watching. In this one, the overall production has a definite Disney style to it, which makes it different from the original, but as a movie it works pretty well.",1360022400,2,1371,4.6570247933884295

300092,4,6300274268,"Disney tries to turn a bitter satire into a fantasy escape movie that you could watch on a cold, cold day in winter. But even Disney can't erase the incidents in the story that were put there by Lewis Carroll. When the Mad hatter wants to have a tea party on the ceiling it shows that he has no respect for Victorian mores. When the Rabbit dashes past Alice saying, ""I'm late, I'm late for a very important date,"" Disney can't change the satiric reference to the so-called established order of Victorian society where every respectable person is supposed to be somewhere on time. The Queen of Hearts is perhaps the most satiric figure. Someone who yells, ""Off with their heads!"" has no place in a Disney film, which at that point turns into a dark nightmare as the cards chase Alice and her friends until Alice finally wakes up and finds herself back home. The nightmare quality of the ending shows what seamy depths lay under the facade of calm and order of mid-nineteenth century society in Great Britain.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-Carroll-s-Alice-s-Adventures-in-Wonderland-With-Artwork-by-Yayoi-Kusama-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141197307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: With Artwork by Yayoi Kusama (Penguin Classics)</a>

She falls downs a rabbit hole and arrives at a wonderland. There Alice meet the White Rabbit, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum & Tweedledee, and the Cheshire Cat and has the adventure of a lifetime. That is the movie in a nutshell. This is one of the rare Disney movies that I find hard to follow and have even a harder time making sense. When Alice In Wonderland first came out in theaters it was booed by the critics, but have since then found a cult following. Alice In Wonderland only gets a C from me.

300243,4,6300274268,"I watched Disney's animated ""Alice In Wonderland"" at the request of my 10 year-old daughter. Based on my (decades-old) memories of seeing this in the theater, I was fully expecting a sugar overload. To my surprise and great pleasure, I was treated to a riot of color, manic activity and enough edgy darkness to make this a truly worthy Lewis Carroll adaptation.

Featuring voice-work from some of old Hollywood's greatest character actors, the animators seemed inspired to explore the limits of their wildest imaginings...creating a Wonderland of marvels, wackiness and more than a bit of real danger.

The result is an animated film that is a visual joy for youngsters, and a guilty pleasure for their parents.
If you don't have a kid, but luv great animated films...treat yourself to ""Alice In Wonderland"" anyway.",1350777600,2,815,5.074626865671642
300244,4,6300274268,"I loved the story of Alice from the first time I read it as a child.  It is the 3rd most quoted literature in English after the Bible and Shakespeare.  The surrealism does a better job of portraying the absurdity of our modern world than any other piece.

I have yet to see a film that does justice to Alice, but Disney comes closest, and is therefore the best way to introduce children and uninitiated adults to Wonderland.  Salvador Dali praised Disney as America's only real surrealist, and the surrealism is adeptly employed in this wonderful film.

This may be my favorite of all the animated Disney films.",1350000000,,611,4.62037037037037

300297,3,6300274268,"After its initial, and critically-savaged, release in 1951, ""Alice"" languished in the Disney vaults for more than 20 years, until the late-60s craze for all things psychedelic, renewed interest in ""Alice"" and made it a cult-favorite for college rentals. Finally re-released to theaters in the early 70s, I saw it 5 times as a Tween. In contrast to today's glut of animated fare, back then ""Alice"" was like water in the desert.

What kept me coming back? it wasn't the craziness of all the characters Alice meets -- the ""draw"" was the animation of Alice herself, so beautifully and gracefully done. Many years later I found out how the animators (Disney's legendary ""nine old men"") did it: They made a live-action film first, to use as a reference.

Like me at that time, Alice dreams of a ""world of my own,"" an escape from her boring life of dreary, colorless schoolbooks with no pictures. But in the grand old tradition of ""be careful what you wish for,"" once she gets what she wants, she finds that a wonder-world where ""everything is nonsense"" is peopled with zanies who range from unbearably frustrating to downright nasty. Ever notice that the nicest character in the film is the doorknob?

Storywise, the film isn't much. Alice's Adventures are episodic and disjointed; she goes from one encounter to the next, and there doesn't seem to be any real point to the story except the aforementioned ""be careful what you wish for."" Unlike Cinderella or Snow White, Alice undergoes no great transformation or dream-come-true -- she goes back to her dreadfully dull life, presumably still the same girl she was at the beginning. (""That's it? Seriously?"")

That said, the film is still a visual feast, abounding in sight gags both large and small. Largest is the positively brilliant ""March of the Cards."" But don't overlook the funny species of birds Alice runs into, when she's lost in the woods -- nor the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when the Dodo picks up an entire campfire in his bare wings.

Musically, ""Alice"" has more songs than most Disney films -- too bad most of them are mere snippets! I wish ""Jabberwocky"" and the sensual ""A-E-I-O-U"" could have had longer arrangements. But the lush ""Golden Afternoon"" is the envy of any Sweet-Adelines chorus. And did you ever notice that everything the Queen of Hearts says, is punctuated by a brass section? Sometimes I wish I could turn the vocals off and just study the orchestrations!",1348876800,,2438,4.879227053140097
300298,5,6300274268,The feelings of nostalgia crept through me as my daughter watch the movie. Seen her excited about Alice and the rabbit brought back feelings of how I enjoyed it when I originally watched it.,1348185600,,190,4.617647058823529

When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues as a posted review for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (this title) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp, as these are the two most well known Alice's. Rather than attempt to add yet-another-review here, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse for a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon will have a specific review of the relevant production with same title used throughout.

To continue...
I claim to be neither a Lewis Carroll nor an Alice in Wonderland expert. Rather, I went into this project naive... ignorant of the details of the story of Alice in Wonderland... ignorant of the poems within the story, and certainly ignorant of the comings and goings in Lewis Carroll's life that set up the circumstances allowing him to imagine the story of Alice in Wonderland (originally entitled ""Alice's Adventures Underground"", by the way).

Watching that 1951 Disney rendition of AIW was a remarkable experience. It was fun to ""remember"" the story of Alice again, but also, it left me with a desire to see how else the Alice story has been rendered. The Disney film is of course animation. So how would Alice in Wonderland be portrayed in other mediums? What I learned is that AIW has been rendered in about every way you can imagine. Most familiar of course is the telling of the Alice story in film, with live action, animation, and various combinations of both. In fact since the invention of film at the turn of the 20th century not a decade has gone where at least one (and usually several) fresh renderings of the Alice story been told in moving pictures.

Beyond that however the Alice story has been told in many forms: audio recordings, plays, ballets, operas, and musicals. It's been done with the use of puppets and marionettes, with stop motion ""Gumby style"" animation, in games, in home-brew backyard productions posted to YouTube, and as an Alice in Wonderland theme park. There's even been an X rated version done as a musical (quite good). A number of established shows have done a take on the Alice story; The Muppets, Sesame Street, The Care Bears, Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, Barney, Scooby Doo, The Simpsons, Star Trek TOS, and even `Hello Kitty' took a shot at Alice.

What's more, a wide variety of famous actors and celebrities have appeared in an Alice film. Stars from W.C. Fields to Cary Grant to Peter Sellers to Richard Burton... The Smothers Brothers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Dudley Moore, Brooke Shields, Maryl Streep, Debbie Allen, Nathan Lane, Sammy Davis Jr., Ringo Starr, Terry Garr, and Whoopi Goldberg, just to name a few, have been involved in some sort of Alice production.

And then there are the numerous Alice based endeavors, from Woody Allan's `Alice' with Mia Farrow, to Jefferson Airplane's `White Rabbit'.

Why? Why is Lewis Carroll's story of a young girl who fell down a mythical rabbit hole so compelling? What gives the story such staying power? How is it that people of virtually all ages are so inexplicably drawn toward Alice and her land of wonders?

I don't know.

I've tried to steer clear of scholarly answers that address that question. There have been many attempts to do so. On the surface we can locate several plausible reasons that explain why Alice in Wonderland resonates with so many. We have a young, [seemingly] helpless girl. She's an underdog. Out of her element. A vulnerable character put in jeopardy. We ask, ""what will happen next?"", as the story takes one unexpected turn after another. And of course animals with human attributes in any story is compelling. Walt Disney discovered that innate attraction and made an industry of it. But do these answers get to the heart of the question?

I happen to believe the explanation of Alice in Wonderland's universal appeal is that we, all of us, all human beings, young and old, have been to Wonderland ourselves. We go there in our dreams. We can all relate to the experience of logic and proportion falling away because it has happened to us. We understand how, in all the bizarreness of the wonderlands we fall into at night, that we rarely lose our heads. We should be really scared. Alice should be really scared. But somehow we accept what we see. Such is the worlds of dreams.

Furthermore, how many of us have wondered if we continue to dream after we die? Are dreams what the afterlife is composed of? We don't fully understand the nature of dreams, so we contemplate upon them. Even the errant machine HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey asked if he would dream after he was turned off.

And now to return to the original question I postulated. How did I somehow know the story of Alice in Wonderland without having a particular recollection of reading the book? Or seeing a movie? One answer of course is that pieces of the story just leaked into my consciousness over the years. A movie clip here. A verbal explanation there. But could there be a deeper reason? It may have to do with ""archetype"". It is certain that Alice in Wonderland acts as a metaphor for dreams, but the Alice Stories seems to delve deeper... into a primal archetype --a ""template"" if you will-- out of which human circumstances arise. Because of that we recognize Alice's dilemma in a deep and fundamental way.

To write the story of Alice in Wonderland Lewis Carroll had in some way become conscious of the meta-physical world. The world beyond normal perception. A world that is, as Rod Serling put it, ""beyond that which is known to man"". Whereas visual artists such as Hieronymus Bosch reflected their visions of the other-world in paintings, Lewis Carroll's palette was paper and words. I would not be surprised if Carroll had at some point and in some fashion become ""experienced"", in a Jimmy Hendrix sort of way.

Anyway, enjoy every telling of the Alice story you can get your hands on. Each one is unique. It's fascinating to see how the core Alice story is manifested in different media. It's fun to see how the various animals are rendered. If you can, read the books first. If you can't, remember that anything to with a playing card motif, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Hearts, the stolen tarts, the Duchess, falling down the rabbit hole and the pool of tears, the White Rabbit, growing and shrinking, the Mad Hatter (and tea party), Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Mock Turtle, and the Gryphon, -phew- all come from Alice in Wonderland.

A motif based upon a chessboard, The Red King and Queen, the White King and Queen, the Red Knight and White Knight, the Jabberwocky, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, Hatta and Haighaa (a disguised appearance by the Mad Hatter and the March Hare), and the The Walrus and the Carpenter come from Through the Looking Glass.

You'll find that many renderings of Alice in Wonderland combine elements of both books, and you know...

Not everyone likes what's often been done
turning the story of Alice on ear
but I say, it's in spirit of fun
there's really nothing at all to fear

so what if Walt Disney brought forth Tweedledum and Tweedl-dee
and introduced Alice to the Walrus and his carpenter bud-ee
and all those talking flowers! Such beau-tees
it's been done by others dontcha see
all for the sake of cre-a-ti-vi-ty

yeah, Disney took license with the main stor-ee
added song and dance, and a touch of glee
a lovely embellished for all to see
this movie will last for an e-ter-ni-tee

so yeah
you-know-what?
it's really O-K.
It's all just a dream an-y-old-way

of the many many versions of this fine tale
hardly any of the a-dap-ta-tions fail
they've all been done with narry a shred of malice
all in all it's in the spirit of our dear friend Alice

so go visit Netflix
Amazon
and Youtube
No one will care...
an Alice you'll love will be waiting for you there
and if the telling don't exactly track Mr. Dodgson's theme
like we said before... it's only a dream

True, recent ones haven't been up to par -- too treacly, preachy, or, worst of all, politically correct.  But 1951's ""Alice in Wonderland"" has all the artistry, charm, and magic one expects from Disney's Golden Age.  That being said, and despite some terrific moments and scenes, I was dismayed by the lack of thought and effort that went into this interpretation of the Lewis Carroll classic.  In addition to some unexpected tedium, the plot was disjointed, and never really built on itself or went anywhere.  Worst of all was the ending, which was abrupt and unsatisfying.

300338,4,6300274268,"This is the Disney version of the movie I'm reviewing; the one with Katherine Beaumont playing the voice of the curious, energetic, dinner-bell-shaped, delightfully-pedantic character of Alice.  I'm just going to say this up front; it has little to teach anyone morally or religiously, but in spite of this, I think this is one of the most fun movies I've ever watched.

In retrospect, in fact, there are a couple of really good ways to watch this film; both of which are very enjoyable.

Way number one is to look for the symbolism in the story, and believe me when I say that it is there.  The original Alice in Wonderland books were brilliantly-disguised pieces of social and political sattire, with the behaviors of the various characters poking fun at a number of trends which existed at the time, and much the same thing can be found here.

You can easily see corrupt, greedy elitists in the Walrus, hardworking, but still rather selfish ordinary people in the Carpenter, Dodo could be a parody of every foolish figure in public office who tries to solve problems by making them worse, and seems utterly oblivious to the cares of those he's hurting, etc...  Then, of course, the symbolism found in characters like the stuck-up, in-crowdy flower patch, the beatnik caterpillar and the Queen of Hearts are so easy to decypher as to be laughable.

On the other hand, you could just watch it the way that I nearly always watch it; laugh in delight as Alice uses her apparently-magic skirt to parachute down into Wonderland, grows and shrinks incessantly, and meets all manner of ridiculous things and people in the process.  In short, you could watch the movie just for fun; as a welcome escape from the world of men.

My favorite animated Disney movies of all time are Fantasia, Beauty and the Beast, and this movie.  Each plays a special role and each does something different.  Fantasia tells no single, concrete story.  Beauty and the Beast tells a very definite story.  Alice in Wonderland is middle-of-the-roadish, in that it tells a series of mini-stories which last only a short time, and are rather disconnected from one another.  Weird things happen, the main character moves on, and more weird things happen.  This is the element of the movie that every child loves.

However, as an adult, I find something more in Alice than I do in Wonderland.  To be perfectly honest, I think the personality of Alice is as much of a draw for me as the land she explores.  Alice is very curious and brave; daring and bold, but not obnoxious.  Perhaps most distinctively, Alice distinguishes herself from other cartoon heroines in that she seems to have a raging obsession with formality, dignity and politeness, which I still find one of the most charming traits any protagonist could possibly have.

Speaking personally, I never saw Alice as an everyman type, or an avatar for the viewer.  Of all the amazing things in Wonderland, she, a child who's truly concerned with being polite, may be one of the most amazing.  Children may relate to her confusion at seeing so many strange things in the world, and her sense of wonder when she encounters them, but I think it would be too much to suggest that there is any child quite like her.

Any problems that I might have with this film stem entirely from its lack of any clear message or moral, and that's merely a personal bias of mine.  I also would have liked it to be longer, but I think that about most of the movies I really enjoy.  If you like odd characters, strange behaviors, weird situations, bizarre creatures, and just plain unusualness all around, seen with the eyes of a protagonist who's as dignified and polite as the world is strange, then what you're looking for can probably be found in Wonderland.

In fact, in a way, all of this is reminiscent of our own desired destiny; a journey onwards into a world of great wonders and fewer limits in terms of what is and isn't possible.",1338422400,2,3945,4.689404934687953

300340,4,6300274268,"OK, I know what happened. I don't think I ever saw this in a theater, and I'm pretty sure I never saw it in color. We only had a black and white TV in the days when I was watching the Disney TV show, and this movie was originally 1 1/4 hour long. So when it was on TV, it was cut to fit an hour-long show minus time for commercials. I think the cutting must have been pretty artful, because the parts I don't remember were not all that germane to the story. But one that helps understand what happened to Alice is the part before she followed the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole. She sings a song about a world of her own, where everything is nonsense. And of course elements of the song show up later in her adventures underground.

One thing I've always disliked about the Disney adaptation is that it took things from both Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, and mashed them together in such a way that my generation grew up not even realizing we were talking about two different books.

This movie is an old friend, and indeed I took a dozen screen shots to keep. I think the artwork has survived my adulthood rather better than the story as a whole.

300392,5,6300274268,"The 2-disc ""Un-Anniversary"" DVD is a wonderful set that complements the wonderful film with a treasure trove of interesting bonus content for the Disney enthusiasts and film historians among us.  It's a thoroughly satisfying DVD, though I can't offer a comparison to other versions that have been released.

THE MOVIE:

I loved watching the Disney animated films on VHS when I was a kid, but as I got older I tended to favor the more recent Disney hits (""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"", etc.) over the original classics.  I hadn't enjoyed ""Alice in Wonderland"" as much as, say, ""Peter Pan"" or even ""101 Dalmatians"", so the tape gathered dust over the years and my recollection of the movie got buried in my mind.  It had been so long since I'd seen ""Alice"" that when I watched this DVD I found there were scenes and songs that I'd forgotten all about, so it was like viewing the film with a fresh perspective.

And I must say that this movie is great.  It's delightfully surreal and whimsical, and it's filled with fun characters and memorable scenes.  The animation by Disney's team is, unsurprisingly, fantastic and the art, styled after Mary Blair's graphic sensibilities, is beautiful.  The movie may not pack the wallop of some of Disney's higher-rated masterpieces, but it's a wonderful animated adventure.

THE BONUS FEATURES:

Although this DVD doesn't contain a full-length audio commentary, the ""Reflections On Alice"" featurette is a satisfying retrospective on Lewis Carroll's stories, Walt Disney's efforts to bring them to the screen, and the impact of the 1951 film.

""Operation Wonderland"" is a fascinating vintage promotional featurette that takes a behind-the-scenes look at the making of ""Alice in Wonderland"" at the Disney animation studio.  Walt Disney leads narrator James Melton through the studio, showing how animation cels are photographed, how sequences are storyboarded, and how animators reference live-action performances.  There's some priceless footage of vaudeville comedian Ed Wynn (the voice of the Mad Hatter), Kathryn Beaumont (Alice), and Jerry Colonna (the March Hare) acting out the tea party scene on a soundstage while the animators sketch away.  (Improvised dialogue from these sessions was incorporated into the final film.)

A more awkward curiosity is the half-hour excerpt from an episode of The Fred Waring Show, which promotes the music of the Disney film, featuring Kathryn Beaumont and Sterling Holloway (the Cheshire Cat) along with a chorus dressed in disturbingly crude costumes.

The DVD also contains several demo recordings of songs that did not make it into the final film, as well as an early storyboard sequence of the scene from the book with the Duchess and her baby (which didn't make it into the film either).  The extensive art gallery features concept art from some different artists, including a showcase of Mary Blair's beautifully stylized work, along with some behind-the-scenes photos of Walt Disney and his animators.

We even get two of Walt's television introductions to the film (a black & white one from 1954 and a very similar color one from 1964) and two theatrical trailers.

Disc One contains the classic (and totally relevant) Mickey Mouse cartoon ""Thru the Mirror"", and Disc Two contains the early 1920s live-action/animation hybrid short ""Alice's Wonderland"".

""One Hour in Wonderland"" is a family-friendly holiday television special from 1950 featuring Walt Disney, Kathryn Beaumont, Edgar Bergen (with his pals Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, of course), and Bobby Driscoll.  It shows clips from Mickey Mouse cartoons and Disney films like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Song of the South"" (Uncle Remus!), and, you guessed it, the soon-to-be-released ""Alice in Wonderland"".  (The black & white program has been reconstructed for DVD to include movie clips in full color.)  There's also a neat appearance by the Firehouse Five Plus Two, the dixieland band made of Disney animators.

For the younger crowd, Disc One contains interactive games and activities (""Virtual Wonderland Party"" and ""Adventures in Wonderland"") which can be played using the remote control.  So there's enough extras to satisfy just about anyone.

THE VERDICT:

""Alice in Wonderland"" is a unique fantasy from the glory days of Walt Disney animation.  It's enchanting to kids and adults alike, and really is a work of art.  The 2010 ""Un-Anniversary Edition"" DVD is a delightful package for anyone who loves the film and a welcome addition to any collection.  Definitely worth buying if you're interested, although this version may be outdated by more recent re-releases.",1332720000,2,4629,5.2317073170731705

This film is one of the most mature and thoughtful of all Disney films, and manages to capture some of the dreamy, frightening, enchanting and nightmarish atmosphere of the books. Alice is a children's story in name only: it is best described as a semi-benign nightmare of epic proportions.

Alice's chase down the rabbit hole leads to her encounters with many odd characters culled from both books, from Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee to the Walrus and the Carpenter to the Cheshire Cat and the Caterpillar. Much has been made of the caterpillar with the hookah, not without some justification, one feels, and likewise the Cheshire Cat - all very surreal and distant. When Alice grows very quickly after eating the biscuit, the next 10 minutes of images are beyond all doubt of an extremely lewd nature, and once you have grasped this it becomes very obvious. I am astonished that Disney got away with it as it is so blatant, but it is charmingly done ..... I have always thought this but have seen it suggested elsewhere in print only recently.

The music in the DVD is very good and the voices are just superb. Alice's precise, confused, petulant and adolescent nature is well-captured by the ever-excellent Kathryn Beaumont. Disney Stalwart Pat O'Malley sings and acts his way through the film in superb form (T Dum and T Dee, Walrus and Carpenter)and Sterling Holloway is as classy as ever. Songs that really work are ""Unbirthday"" ""Painting the Roses Red"" ""Father William"" and many others.

Highly recommended, and any film that has one Dink Trout as the King of Hearts gets my vote. Probably the closest Disney ever came to getting the right ""feel"" to a film and in places this is actually pretty subversive.

The colors are vibrant, the picture clear. It looks like a modern film, but it still has the charms of a classic. I can't think of any way to emphasize how great the blu ray conversion is. It.......wow.

Should I review the film itself? It's a classic Disney film, what else? In this adaption of the classic tale, Alice falls into Wonderland, meeting the usual suspects but told in a way only Disney can. Things are removed, things added, but it doesn't seem inappropriate. it flows beautifully with Disney's adapted tale.

The blu ray includes many bonus features which should be in the description. Most are very insightful, great for avid fans. One or two are pointless, but that's something minor.

The real problem isn't that this adaptation dilutes or distorts the original story, it's that it just isn't a very good film -- the script is disjointed and confusing and the animation follows suit.  Obviously, it being a Disney film, there are millions of people who love it, so take what I say with a grain of salt... just look at the hundreds of ""five star"" reviews that surround mine.

300493,3,6300274268,"Disney had an affinity for Alice novels going back to his initial years in the industry with Alice and Cartoonland. He attempted to make a live-action version with Mary Pickford in 1933 while affiliated with United Artists though its more than obvious that it was not commercially viable firstly because of Paramount's adaption secondly has to with that its not fathomable for that type of adaption to have the same impact as Snow White which shaped the family film market as we know it today, contrary to what people might have previously thought however is that Disney's films did have psychological undertones not akin to what would be seen in a children's movie.

Alice in Wonderland seems to be Walt's original labor of love gone awry due to conflicting interests in other endeavors such as building up Disneyland or advocating for the space program to counter the Russians Alice among other films took second seat. Again Walt is quite the multi-tasker in the 1950's that not every film is to up to par with what he had previously established. Being invested in so many other endeavors inhibits Walt to invest at the film at task since he is so focused on other endeavors this is exactly what sabatoged a good bulk of his movies.

One of the redeeming qualities is Mary Blair's conceptual influence on the film. However it doesn't seem to have much else artistically or stylistically going for it. Its episodic, serialized like many other previous Disney endeavors however in many cases the atmosphere itself seems the same throughout. The environment doesn't really change because it is inherent of Mary Blair's influence, while talented it is overly dependent on her skill. The other thing to take into consideration is our heroines naivety which makes many of the bi-polar villains in this film such as the Queen of Hearts and Mad Hatter unwilling to cope. She never really shows remorse because personality is not effective and she acts as if she has no muscles or any actual sincere emotions, only Milt Kahl and Marc Davis animate her effectively again it seems that there are conflicting interests to focus on other things instead of this film so there is little invest to make this project work. Also again when it comes to coming up short on personality this is a contradiction of the company who established personality in the early to mid-thirties when they were technologically building up their company.",1305936000,,2420,4.9

Celebrating its 60th anniversary, Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland looks perfect on Blu-ray. The movie was nominated for one Oscar (best score) and contains a number of songs, as well as having a strong musical presence throughout.

Watching a classic Disney title is like stepping back in time. Compared to modern animation, the classics contain more warmth and less peril. There's also considerably less action. The stories are full of wonder and revel in showing the viewer the setting. One common theme running through all of the titles is the friendly nature of animals and inanimate objects.

In Alice in Wonderland, all of the animals talk. You'll also hear from flowers and a door knob. It's a strange fantasy world inhabited by weird creatures. The adventure begins when Alice follows a white rabbit down a hole. She stumbles across such creatures as oysters, a walrus, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat and an army of somewhat threatening playing cards.

Alice can change size by eating things in Wonderland. This can be helpful, but regularly causes her problems. Nothing is logical because it's the stuff of dreams. Most of the creatures are friendly and well-meaning, but there are a few moments of danger when Alice encounters the Queen of Hearts.

The movie has a few too many songs for my particular taste, although it works perfectly as a family film. It's not hard to see why the movie has enchanted children for the past 60 years as there's always something interesting happening. For adults watching it alone, it won't appeal to everyone in the way that perhaps a Pixar movie would. This is mainly aimed at children.

I found myself recognizing some of the voices. The Cheshire Cat was voiced by Sterling Holloway who also played Winnie the Pooh and Kaa the Snake in The Jungle Book. Kathryn Beaumont, who is still alive, voiced Wendy Darling in Peter Pan.

While the movie is a lot of fun, it lacks the heart and innocence of other early Disney classics such as Bambi or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. That said, it deserves a place in your library if you have young children. The colors, songs, memorable creatures and fast pace will hold the attention of most children.

Video Quality 5/5
Quite simply, the transfer couldn't be better. The colors are bright and the image is clean. It looks like the characters were drawn yesterday. The only thing that makes the movie look dated is the style of the animation. It's a lot flatter and lacks the three-dimensional appearance of modern Disney movies such as Bolt or the Pixar titles. Nobody will be disappointed with the appearance of this 60th anniversary Blu-ray edition.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
There are two English audio tracks included, along with French and Spanish tracks. One English track is a restored stereo version of the original soundtrack. My preferred version is the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix. Everything is clear, but the track is front-heavy. You will hear something from your rears, but it won't match more recent releases. However, this is another fine upgrade over previous releases.

Special Features 5/5

There are over four hours of additional features, the best of which is the 76-minute Through the Keyhole: A Companion's Guide to Wonderland feature.

Deleted Materials includes 21 minutes of footage that didn't make it into the film.

The remaining features include a song, an interactive game, TV specials and reflections on the film.

The Alice in Wonderland Blu-ray offers a huge jump in quality over previous releases of the film. Disney hasn't disappointed me yet. Also included is a DVD version. It's not the best of the classic Disney titles, but is worthy of being in any collection.

300528,5,6300274268,"""Alice in Wonderland"" looks great in this Blu-ray 60th Anniversary Special Edition.  The 1951 animated classic is based mostly on Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" with a few elements from ""Through the Looking Glass.""  Walt Disney first thought about adapting Carroll's book into a full-length movie back in 1923 when he was a 21-year-old filmmaker trying to make a name for himself.

This ""Alice ..."" was made well before digital animation existed, so every image is hand-drawn, hand-painted, and individually photographed.  Voice talent includes Kathryn Beaumont (Alice), Ed Wynn (Mad Hatter), Verna Felton (Queen of Hearts), Sterling Holloway (Cheshire Cat), Richard Haydn (Caterpillar), and Bill Thompson (White Rabbit).

As with most Disney Blu-ray and DVD releases, there is a huge number of bonus features.  ""Through the Keyhole: A Companion's Guide to Wonderland"" accompanies the movie with references to the original Carroll classic. ""Reference Footage: Alice and the Doorknob"" shows Kathryn Beaumont, the voice of Alice, providing an introduction to newly discovered footage of Alice talking to the doorknob.  Also included are a newly discovered Cheshire Cat song, ""I'm Old,"" the animated cartoon ""Thru the Mirror"" starring Mickey Mouse, deleted scenes, storyboards, original song demos, and Walt Disney TV introductions from 1954 and 1964.",1297814400,2,1369,5.681372549019608
300529,4,6300274268,"""I'm going to be late...very late"" is a quote from Alice in Wonderland that I think I have heard almost all my life.  Alice in Wonderland has captured the hearts of generations because Alice's dream seems so real yet so different from she is used to.  Alice is a child who is being pressured to act and enjoy things that older children enjoy and her dream puts her into the world of childhood fun and adventure.  Alice in Wonderland has now released for its 60th Anniversary on Blu-ray with never before seen parts and stunning color.

Synopsis: ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a story about a young girl who grows bored listening to her older sister read aloud from a history book about William I of England. While dozing off, she dreams about falling down a rabbit hole (""Wonderland"") that is populated by a peculiar series of misadventures. The always sensible Alice whirls through a world of contradictions, imagination and surprises where she encounters amazing creatures - including a pocket watch-toting White Rabbit, the imperious Queen of Hearts and her army of playing cards, a Cheshire Cat with a lingering smile in an unforgettable fantasy, and the off-kilter Madhatter - and tests her sensibility and courage. In the end it's all a dream, she is awakened by her sister's voice, and as the two of them return home for teatime where she realizes that perhaps logic and reason exist for purpose. And in return, her sister realizes affectionately that Alice is still young, but will grow-up in time.

My Opinion:  It had been a long time since I had seen Alice in Wonderland and viewing it from the eyes of an adult versus a child made the movie watching completely different for me.  The White Rabbit has always been my favorite character.  His veracity for time makes him lovable yet obnoxious.  It made me think that the White Rabbit really relates to many adults as we rush around with our time lines and agendas.  We never have time to play and enjoy life.

Alice shrinking has always been a favorite part for me especially as a child because I dreamed of being a smaller size and entering a different world other than my own.  The Queen of Hearts also scared me as a child and I believe that a small child could definitely still be afraid of both the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter.  It is not a movie that my children any time soon because of their age and lack of understanding.  I love how Alice's sister realizes that Alice is still just a child and not to rush her into adulthood.  This is something that I need to remember as I work with my children.

Disney has taken Alice in Wonderland to new heights of color, sound, and quality by putting her on Blu-ray.  I loved seeing the movie in a new way.  This special edition with its new games and special intro by Walt is definitely a great addition to collector's edition and for those who have never seen the classic Alice in Wonderland.",1297468800,4,4879,4.7452153110047846

I enjoy watching version after version, each taking a shot at making Lewis Carroll's dreamlike, episodic prose and poetry into a film or TV production that is cohesive and at the same time, worthy of the fantastic images we all have in our minds as we read.

Unless the story is changed markedly--as Tim Burton did with his 2010 version, the only big screen ""Alice"" that was a box office smash--many have tried with varying results. Walt Disney's 1951 version, which is presented for the first time on a ""60th Anniversary"" Blu-Ray combo package in this edition also including a not-quite-so-decked-out-with-bonus-materials DVD.

The ""Alice"" material was clearly close to Walt Disney since he did his own twist on the idea in his first successful film series, the Alice comedies, in which a live action Virginia Davis interacted with animated creatures. ""Alice in Wonderland"" was also almost the first Disney animated feature until ""Snow White"" was ultimately selected. Mary Pickford was to play a live Alice for Disney, along with Ginger Rogers--and even Margaret O'Brien, whose mother turned it down because of the price offered (a fact she recently told talk show host Stu Shostak on a recent shokusradio.com broadcast).

By the time ""Alice"" was underway as an all-animated feature, the studio was still hurting from WWII losses, the 1950 release ""Cinderella"" had helped things considerably and high hopes were dashed when ""Alice"" initially underperformed at the box office.

The musical score lived on through the decades, even though the film was out of general release for 23 years and shown twice in edited form on TV. The ultimate public embrace of Disney's ""Alice"" came over the last few decades as it became a staple of home video and cable TV. Now, as Alice voice Kathryn Beaumont states quite truthfully in the new bonus documentary, it is absolutely now one of the most popular and beloved Disney animated features.

The very things that were problematic for ""Alice"" as a '50s movie have become assets in modern times. The choppy, episodic nature makes it ideal for television and video. It's loose, zany, irreverent style is welcome to kids brought up on Spongebob and Bullwinkle. The voice cast, once almost completely well-known to the world at large, now fits the characters better than ever--and have become iconic on their own. And perhaps above all, the look of the film is a monument to the legendary Disney art director Mary Blair. See the recent New York Times review for more about that.

For those on the fence about investing in Blu-ray, ""Alice"" provides a very strong argument. The crisp angles are razor sharp and each color's nuance is shown to best advantage.

But my favorite feature on the Blu-ray disc is ""Through the Keyhole-A Companion's Guide to Wonderland,"" which is better described as a ""video commentary."" Like an audio commentary, this bonus feature accompanies the entire film, which plays on one part of the screen or another while expert commentators like Brian Sibley, Paula Sigman and many others discuss the film, Walt Disney, and especially Lewis Carroll, in a very sensitive and non-sensational way, offering thoughtful insights and endless details.

For DVD owners, you may want to keep your previous editions (there are three) to hang onto all the features, many of which have been included only on the Blu-ray this time around (though DVD player owners can still enjoy very nice ""Reflections on Alice"" featurette, which includes comments from the marvelously effervescent Stacia Martin and others). But I still don't think that absolutely all the marvelous features from the wondrous laserdisc of Alice have all been included on any DVD or Blu-ray.

But if they want to do another reissue, that's fine with me. Like ""Mary Poppins,"" regular home video reissues keep the films fresh and in the public eye. If that makes me a little ""mad,"" well, don't let's be silly!",1297382400,4,3966,5.015197568389058
300553,5,6300274268,"Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"" finally comes to Blu-ray & the wait is well worth it. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a film that was just begging for a high-definition home transfer & now that it has been released in Blu-ray, you can see that this is true. I don't think there is another animated Disney movie that uses colors quite like Alice does. And on Blu-ray, the colors are the star of this film. So bright, so sharp, so...perfect! The colors are perfect, but the film itself is also pristine. Not a speck of dust or grain appears in the entire film. I was totally blow away by this release. Normally, when watching a high-definition picture, my first impression (if the picture is good) is ""Wow!"" & then as the film goes on, my brain settles in & I don't notice the high-def anymore. But with Alice, this wasn't the case. For the entire movie, I was blown away. I noticed how great the backgrounds are in the film. Check them out in the real world at the beginning of the film. Just fantastic! Then check out how they change when Alice enters Wonderland. Angles change. They're sharp & just like Wonderland itself, crazy!

I must recommend highly to add this film to your Blu-ray collection. Besides the movie itself, there is tons of bonus material, including a running video commentary that runs along-side the film, which tells the story of the making of the film, as well as the making of the book. As with the other 1:33 to 1 Disney movies that have been released on Blu-ray before Alice, this disc has the absolutely useless feature of ""Disney View"", which adds annoying, out-of-place artwork on the sides of film to needlessly fill in your wide-screen TV. Does anyone really use Disney View?

Anyway, the bottom line is this is the best looking Blu-ray I've ever seen & you owe it to yourself to own it.",1297382400,2,1811,4.552147239263804

I have Snow White, Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast, etc. and every time the phenomenal restorations blow my mind.  My eyes are usually bugged out in amazement release after release. Thus, by now you'd think that my expectations would be well prepared for what I was about to see with Alice in Wonderland--but no, just seconds into this 60-year-old masterpiece I started to cry.  No, not a gushing pool-of-tears sort of crying, but a crying nonetheless.

The 1080p transfer is Amazing.  It's better than Amazing--it's somewhere between Mesmerizing, Astonishing, Perfect, and Life-Changing.  I'm comparing it to the VHS copy I watched till it broke as a kid, as well as the more recent 2004 ""Masterpiece Edition"" DVD that I not-so-secretly watched a bazillion times as an adult.  I can't even begin to describe how beautiful the picture looks, but the reds are pure fire, the tea party is a kaleidoscope of every vibrant color you could dream of, the Rabbit's eyes are are a hypnotic magenta that I've never seen before because the standard definitions couldn't bold them enough.  The sound quality is rich and lively, it might as well have been recorded in the world's top recording studio yesterday.

Overall, without question this is one of the most important Vault Disney titles to get.  Don't let your mind be rotted by Tim Burton's commercialist adaptation with dancing Depp when you can experience a masterpiece of visual art, music, and storytelling from Walt Disney himself.  Alice in Wonderland has always been one of my top five favorite Disney films.  It's the only adaptation, as far as I'm concerned, that correctly portrays the childish innocence from the Lewis Carroll books, along side the adult brilliance in the characters, ""morals"", and possibly herb-induced inspirations.  I haven't got around to watching the extras yet, but they really don't matter to me.  I got the most stunning Blu Ray transfer of one of my favorite movies for an affordable price.  I'm very satisfied. :)

This picture quality is indeed superb and makes this blu-ray very much worthwhile.

Unfortunately, the advertised DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix must be proactively selected.  Unlike most Disney Classics Blu-rays, the default on Alice is stereo Dolby Digital.  That's a shame, because the lossless DTS-HD MA track is very well done and nicely balanced.  Given the importance of audio on the blu-ray format (and frankly, to Disney Animation), unless someone can provide a good reason for defaulting to lossy, stereo, Dolby Digital, i'm docking this otherwise beautiful transfer 2 stars.",1296777600,,721,5.2894736842105265
300557,5,6300274268,"""Alice in Wonderland"", the 1951 Walt Disney animated classic is probably more well-known to this current generation for the live action film that came out in 2010 but for previous generations, the Walt Disney animated classic, the 13th film of the Walt Disney Animated Classics Series captured the hearts of Americans as it technically was an impressive and colorful film.

But ""Alice in Wonderland"" was one of the most difficult films for Walt Disney.  Originally planned for creation in the '30s, the film would not come out until the early '50s.  With various written adaptations, the difficulty was trying to take the original 1865 novel and bring it to life via animated.

Part of the problem lies in the fact that the original novel featured a unique style for its fantasy world from its artwork to its original story.  Many wanted to capture Lewis Carroll's story but Walt Disney felt it was too literal and it was not what he wanted.

It's important for people to know that prior to ""Alice in Wonderland"",  Walt Disney and its studios were heavily affected because of World War II, also where the first animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" were a financial success, the second film ""Pinocchio"" was not and other films that would recoup money through worldwide release, wouldn't happen because of the war.  They needed a film that would be a financial hit at the box office and something that would doom the company.

While ""Dumbo"" was cheaper and did make its money back, ""Bambi"" would lose money because of World War II and this delayed ""Alice in Wonderland"" (and also ""Peter Pan"").  In fact, Walt Disney was heavily in debt from the '30s and '40s that in 1950, everything was put on the line with the film ""Cinderella"" and fortunately, the film was financially successful and eventually gave Disney the freedom it needed to create more animated films.

""Alice in Wonderland"" (which can be seen as one of the books in the opening of ""Pinocchio"") would finally be created after nearly 18 years of discussion of the project and almost 30 years after Walt Disney made the original ""Alice Comedy"".

And this film would follow visuals full of color courtesy of Mary Blair and company.  Music would be the focus of the film (the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film) and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrol's books (this of course would anger British film and literary critics).

But unfortunately, the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be re-released theatrically, ""Alice in Wonderland"" was not re-released during Walt Disney's lifetime but only on television.  In ""The Disney Films"", animator Ward Kimball is quoted as saying the film failed because there were too many directors.  Each director trying to one-up the other director.  In his words, ""had a self-canceling effect of the final product"".

But ""Alice in Wonderland"" did find new life and that was during the late '60s as drugged out college students loved films that were trippy and cool and eventually along with ""Fantasia"" and ""The Three Caballeros"", ""Alice in Wonderland"" became popular.  But of course, Disney didn't want this film associated with the drug culture and withdrew prints from universities.  But Disney eventually would issue a re-release of the film in 1974.

But for today's current generation who have watched only the live action film of ""Alice in Wonderland"", now is the time to watch ""Alice in Wonderland"" as the film is receiving its 60th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray and DVD.

But before watching this film, for those only familiar with the live action film, think about ""Alice in Wonderland"" (live action) as a sequel to this animated film.  Where the live action focuses on Alice as a young woman, the animated film focusing on Alice as young teenage girl.

VIDEO:

""Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition, Full Screen (1:33:1).  And as anyone who have watched any of the Walt Disney animated classics on Blu-ray, knows that Disney's treatment has been nothing short of perfect.  And because this classic is known for its colors, its animation and presentation, the picture quality of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is magnificent.

I have tested this film on two different types of televisions and suffice to say, this film doesn't look 60-years-old at all.  Wonderland looks absolutely beautiful!  Colors are vibrant and really come out with clarity and as always with Disney, their frame-by-frame restoration shows as there is not one blemish at all.  Alice's blue dress, the Queen's red and black dress, the artistic backgrounds used throughout the colorful world, everything is full of detail.

There are no color blemishes, artifacting, banding, DNR that takes away this visual presentation of this animated classic.  Once again, Disney continues to aim for perfection and again, Disney has achieved it!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The lossless track sounds exquisite and because this film does feature a lot of music, this is the best I have heard of ""Alice in Wonderland"".  Dialogue and music is crystal clear, I didn't notice any hissing, crackle or pop despite this animated film being 60-years-old.  This release is the best I have heard of any video release of ""Alice in Wonderland"" thus far.  Magnificent!

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I find it quite interesting because as a child, I admit that I didn't care for ""Alice in Wonderland"" as I felt it was devoid the action/adventure of ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"" and ""Dumbo"" and even when it was released on video during my teenage and young adult years back in the early through late '90s, I passed on the VHS, LD and the later DVD version.

But with these animated classics being released on Blu-ray, as a reviewer, as a parent, ""Alice in Wonderland"" has been a film that I have stayed away from until today.  This is the first time I have watched ""Alice in Wonderland"" since it was re-released in theaters back in 1981.

And 30-years later, watching it today, I have a better appreciation for the film.  For one, how close the animators were in capturing Kathryn Beaumont's mannerism and movements via the live tapings that were done of her back then.  But also watching how Disney has evolved animation-wise with the overall look and feel of ""Alice in Wonderland"".

Having watched the documentary ""Walt & El Grupo: The Untold Adventures"" and seeing how the 1942 South American  trip helped illustrators grasp a new style with colors, and of course knowing the phenomenal Mary Blair's contribution to ""Alice in Wonderland"" because of her influence from that South American trip, although this film has been discussed since the '30s and it went through so many screenplays and character designs, the long wait by Walt Disney seemed to pay off as the film is a visual feast.  The animation is fantastic, the artistic backgrounds painted for this film is spectacular and if anything, it's a different kind of animated film that Disney has done before.

I have to also say that part of my accepting of this animated film is the fact that I have not read the entire Lewis Carrol stories.  I know that this is a very loosely-based adaptation of the book but Walt Disney wasn't going for accuracy, at the time, he knew what Walt Disney was facing as a company and he needed to create films that were big box office hits and having to tailor it to an audience who have been used to prior Disney-style of animation and storyline and family friendly has always been Disney's focal point.

With that being said, if one was to ask me how I rank ""Alice in Wonderland"", I would give high marks for animation but as for storyline, while a good and fun family film at times, because Walt Disney was going for a visual film with music than a film with a tight narrative, it's not a film that I can easily compare to a ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"" or ""Dumbo"".  It's like comparing apples and oranges, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is entertaining but I similar to ""Fantasia"", I feel that I enjoy parts of the film.  I can say that I enjoy when Alice meets up with the White Rabbit and Dodo Bird moreso than when she met Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.  When it comes to music, I felt I enjoyed songs that were sung by Alice vs. songs sung by the walrus and Cheshire Cat.

I also have to admit that while I enjoy the beginning when Alice arrives to Wonderland, I felt that my interest in the film was more towards scenes in which there was some sort of action.  May it be Alice trying to get use to her changing sizes or her encounter with the Red Queen.

But overall, ""Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary"" is an amazing Blu-ray release.  The amount of entertaining and vintage special features included in this release is impressive and the fact that even some of the original special features from the previous DVD release have been given HD treatment is awesome!

If you are a big fan of this animated Disney classic, you can feel confident that you are going to get the best looking, best sounding, most complete (in terms of special features) version of the film as of this time on Blu-ray.  It's another magnificent Disney classic released on Blu-ray and is highly recommended!",1296691200,33,13231,4.897931654676259

300559,5,6300274268,"Disney continues its slow roll-out of its classic animated features on Bluray; this time, taking another tumble down the rabbit hole to view Alice in Wonderland in all its high-def glory. Rather than yet another review of a much-discussed classic film, I'll talk about the features unique to this latest re-release.

The digitally restored, high-def transfer is breathtaking in scope in that it seems not one frame was left un(re)touched and cleaned. The film sparkles with vibrancy and appears to have been shot yesterday. The colors seem to be as on-target and faithful as those in the Sleeping Beauty bluray. There is a 5.1 Dolby sound option that offers somewhat mixed results in the battle between modern sound-mixing techniques vs. 60 year old monaural masters. Purists can take it or leave; because a restored original monaural version is also offered on the disc.

There are actually few extras that weren't seen in previous dvd releases, but this version trumps them all with its ""Through the Keyhole"" option. This is a very unique commentary/documentary that can be played during the entirety of the film. It offers informative and chatty on-camera interviews with Disney and Carroll historians, generous with little-seen artwork. It plays more like a feature-length documentary than a dvd commentary, is loaded with witty and interesting commentators and is something that I hope dozens of other bluray producers take to heart and attempt to recreate for future releases.

The 1:85:1 aspect ratio of the film is misleading and confusing to many, it seems. The film has not been cropped; it absolutely appears in its original aspect ratio. The widescreen format only refers to the film as seen in ""Disney View"" option, which is an extra that adds an illustrated frame on either side of the original film. (Similar frames were used on the Snow White and Pinocchio blurays). The frame was created solely to placate those persons who'd otherwise freak out at the sight of blackness on the vertical sides of their widescreen televisions while viewing a 1:33:1 film. Film purists and the not-so-easily annoyed will be more than happy to ignore this feature completely.

As to the question of whether to upgrade; well, it depends on what you want from this film and how high it is on your list. As I said, ""Through the Keyhole"" is almost like a feature unto itself, is interesting and is probably worth the price of the disc itself. Seeing ""Alice"" in high-def, of course, is a glorious thing: unseen details pop out for the first time, background characters spring to life and the colors and timing are unsurpassed. Therefore, I give the disc 5 stars, remove my hat for the Disney technicians who worked so hard on faithfully restoring this film and engineering it for bluray, and hope that you will join me in enjoying this release.",1296604800,7,2837,4.9663157894736845
300560,5,6300274268,The movie and sound quality are great. My only issue is that I can now purchase this same Blu-ray Title on Disney.com or at Target for only $9.99,1296604800,,145,4.214285714285714
300561,5,6300274268,"Of all the feature films Walt Disney personally produced, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is one of the best. It easily holds its own with the Big Five, and is one of the high points of post-War animation. It is a near-masterpiece.

I didn't used to think this way. This was partly due to feeling Disney deviated too much from the original (which I was wrong about), as well as recognizing that Carroll's original is impossible to dramatize in a way that preserves the character of the original (which /is/ true). If you kick back and take the sequence of largely disconnected events as they come, it's a lot of fun.

Kathryn Beaumont's Alice is spot-on, perfectly capturing the character's hard-headed common sense, and occasional naivete/vulnerability. Her performance gave the animators exactly what they needed, and they capture her personality perfectly. (I'm not bothered by her brief song about not taking her own advice. It gives a rather hectic film a moment's pause, and it's consistent with Carroll's description of Alice as someone who boxed herself on her own ears in annoyance at her own behavior.) She also looks a lot like Shelley Long. Ed Wynn and Jerry Collonna are perfectly cast as the Mad Hatter and March Hare. (Rocky & Bullwinkle fans will note that Captain Peachfuzz is a direct lift of the Mad Hatter.)

""Alice"" represents a major change in Disney's animation style. For the first time, characters are drawn in an un-naturalistic, severely minimalist style, no more complex than a comic-strip drawing (Tweedle Dum/Dee, the Carpenter, Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts). Some backgrounds verge on the abstract, particularly in the Queen of Hearts sequence. The March of the Cards, with its memorable music, is a tour-de-force of animation, especially the startling end.

The songs are of consistently high quality, with the settings of several Carroll verses standouts. For comparison, listen to Alec Wilder's boringly academic settings for the otherwise delightful readings of the books by Cyril Ritchard.

Box-office-wise, ""Alice"" did the ol' flopperino, which Disney ascribed to its ""having no heart"". Well, neither do the books. Disney has to be congratulated for largely sticking with the original, and not trying to sentimentalize the books. * For someone so determinedly middle-brow, Disney was often well-ahead of his audience.

As with similar direct transfers from the Technicolor negative, there is a huge gain in sharpness, resolution, and shadow detail, along with a reduction in ""smear"" and ""muddiness"". This edition of ""Alice"" looks like no previous edition, and in this case, I'm not complaining. The vividness is appropriate for a story set in a fantastical world. Kris Deering's ignorant review for ""Home Theater"" not only describes this edition as being sourced from a print (!!!), but calls the animation style ""dated"". Hello? Dated in what way?

I've seen many versions of ""Alice in Wonderland"" (including Jan Svankmajer's boring and pretentious film), and Disney's is far and away the most-successful.

* The common criticism the Disney sentimentalized his sources is largely wrong. Disney films are largely free of sentimentality.",1296604800,8,3161,5.233201581027668
300582,3,6300274268,"I'm a little confused.  The product details for the Blu-ray version given by Amazon indicate an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 for this 1951 film of Walt Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland.""  Is this correct?  This aspect ratio wasn't initiated until 1954.  This 1951 movie would have played in theaters with the then standard aspect ratio of 1.37:1.  Did the Disney company crop the frame to get it to fit 1.85:1?  I wouldn't put it past them.  In my opinion the Disney company, these days, will do anything for a dollar.

That being said, this has always been my favorite feature length (only 75 minutes) Disney animated feature and for one reason:  It is funny!  This can't be said for the general run of Disney animated features which are are alternately cute, frightening or sad.  ""Alice in Wonderland"" has zany backgrounds and wonderful voices provided by many great radio performers of the time:  Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, Bill Thompson, Sterling Holloway and the like.  How would anyone not like a cartoon feature with those voices?  I never understood the negative response this film originally received other than that it wasn't what Disney fans had expected.  It makes dream references that are very accurate.  It begins at day, innocently enough, and gradually turns to night with Alice alone and lost in the forest.  I've had many similar dreams which turn from day to night while I'm trying to find my car which has disappeared.

This is not a review of the Blu-ray version of this picture;  I have what is called the Masterpiece Edition which was beautifully processed and done in the films's original aspect ratio or close to it.  Since these are line drawn cartoons, I'm not at all certain that the Blu-ray process could provide much additional visual data.",1296518400,2,1773,4.846666666666667

300586,4,6300274268,"I was first drawn to purchase the original cartoon version of Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland, after watching  Lewis Carroll's 1865 fantasy novel, ""Alice in Wonderland, which featured the stars:  Mia Wasikowska, and Johnny Depp version in 2010.  It was an amazing piece of cinematography, directed by Tim Burton in both digitized computer animation through both IMAX 3D and Disney Digital 3-D, as well as in traditional theaters.
What amazed me while watching the whole re-introduction of this new Alice in Wonderland,  Mia Wasikowska plays the now nineteen-year-old Alice, who 13 years later returns for the first time as a young woman; I could not help but draw parallels to the original Disney presentation, way back in 1951.
In the original Disney film version of 1951, Alice becomes bored and her mind starts to wander. She sees a white rabbit who appears to be in a hurry. She chases it into its burrow and then a most bizarre series of adventures begins.  Kathryn Beaumont plays Alice, and Ed Wynn plays the Mad Hatter.  During the recording sessions, Ed Wynn ad libbed the speech where the Mad Hatter tries to ""fix"" the White Rabbit's watch. (""Muthtard? Leth not be thilly!"") These comical scenes in the first movie made it quite memorable. The comical bits and animation, made an indelible impression on my mind as a child. Such as a fairy tale book come to life - you couldn't help but laugh at the bids, throughout the film.
Also, as a child growing up in the fifties, (yes, I am  baby boomer! ) Walt Disney, was one of the few forms of entertainment, where you could be entertained by real life animation, in full color ( the majority of TV was black and white in those days, before color TV became widely available.) meaning, it was as close to true-to-life cartoon action, you could ever deliver for the technology available in those days.
Part of the special features on disc2 are numerous short featurettes which Walt Disney himself narrated about the production and the storyboards that were carefully crafted and drawn throughout the film.  He shows how Disney studios went through the pain staking process of crafting the movie, in consideration of Lewis Carroll's original artwork in the book, and how Disney put his own personal techniques making the story more colorful and imaginative.  Also, he explained how Alice in Wonderland was one of  the first Disney films that included more musical productions than his earlier works, Snow White and Cinderella, with far most orchestra musical pieces and songs including a theme song, sung by Kathryn Beaumont herself.  It is easy to see how Walt Disney became such a mainstay of the American entertainment industry, it has certainly remained in my imagination all these years into adulthood. This video is definitely a classic and worth the purchase for the children in your life to enjoy.

Mary Blair is referenced for her contributions as are other fine animators and artists.  Kathryn Beaumont is even on here revealing her history with both this picture and the the ensuing Peter Pan.

What this film deserves is a re-mastered Blu-ray release.  It's warranted as many people enjoy this classic animated movie.  Even the historians interviewed on the supplemental material claim that this film is forever embedded in our pop culture consciousness.

300638,5,6300274268,"My wife and I agree, this time.  Disney's 1951 animated feature is the best version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" ever put on the silver screen.  In its re-mastered form the audio and video are just sensational.  And all the old characters, like Ed Wynn, as the Mad Hatter; Sterling Holloway, as the Cheshire Cat; Jerry Colona, as the March Hare; and even Kathryn Beaumont, as Alice, are brighter than ever before.  What is a puzzle, frankly, is why movie makers keep trying to improve on this rendition of the story.  How do you improve on perfection?

Another really nice thing about this DVD are all the Special Features that have background on the making of the 1951 film and various promos and extras.  Included in the latter are clips from the heart-warming, ""Song of the South,"" also by Disney Studios.  How anyone could take exception to this film as racist or negative toward African Americans is another mystery.  It's almost criminal to keep this feature from being made available to the viewing public because a few ultra-sensitive people find negative tones in the show.  Moreover, the visionary, Walt Disney, would never tolerate racism and it's an insult to his memory to say otherwise.

Back on ""Alice in Wonderland,"" go buy this DVD even if you have prior versions taped or recorded some other way.  The sound and picture of the newly-released edition is more than worth the money.  The music, alone, makes the movie a winner.  Then add in all the comedy and story-telling and you have a masterpiece.  My wife and I give this DVD five (5) stars.

My wife and I bought this movie to share with our three-year old daugheter, but there are too many characters and the animation is too busy and quick for her to actually appreciate it.  She basically needs to see the movie 3-4 more times before she can understand all the characters and the scene transitions.  Also, the walrus and the oyster scene, and others, are a little rough to watch.  The animation for the time was good, but even on an HDTV/DVD, you see that the technology is dated.  The animation doesn't pop like today's movies do... but it is what it is (I don't see any need for a blu ray disc for this, because I have the Snow White blu ray disc and there's no point for that either).

As time went on, my memories of it faded and, even when it was on TV, it wasn't a movie I was dieing to see again. So thanks to this new release, I bought it for my sister and finally saw the whole thing from beginning to end. It really isn't, to me anyway, a Disney Classic when compared to Snow White, Bambi, Dumbo or Cinderella. The story is all over the place, but that might also work for it as Wonderland really isn't a coherent place. I don't think Disney should've tried to make a musical out of it. The songs really add nothing to the plot (especially the song Alice sings in the beginning) and while a few are memorable (the Unbirthday Song for example), they're not as memorable as Baby Mine, Someday My Prince Will Come, Feed the Birds, etc. The supporting characters are memorable; the Mad Hatter, March Hare, Queen of Hearts for example do leave an impression (mainly, I think, due to their voice actors), its Alice who is ultimately the blandest character of the whole production. She's not all that interesting as at first she's like ""In my world things that do this would do that and things that do that would this"", then she chases the White Rabbit, runs into a character, resumes her chase of the White Rabbit and then cries how she wants to go home, which to me, makes Alice seem more or less of a Dorothy clone. Her voice actress also doesn't help make the character stand out among the Disney pantheon. I know its the same girl who does Wendy's voice in Peter Pan (again, not really a stand out movie or character in the Disney library), but in either case, she doesn't seem to do anything to make the character memorable. She's dull, listless and I swear she gets one of the most awkward dialog to song transitions in musical history (it happens as she sits in the forest wondering why she doesn't listen to the advice she gives herself). On another good note, the animation that Disney was known for is a standout, the backgrounds imparticular, which were probably one of the reasons this has linked itself to the drug culture of the late 60s. What it comes down to is that, while not outright bad like some of the stuff the studio does today, it really isn't one of their finest moments and its a really lifeless story that doesn't do the author's work any justice. And the fact that three (possibly more from what I've heard) directors don't seem to add anything, making it seem like each one was trying to outdo the other (much like the 5 directors featured in the 1967 Casino Royale, another jumbled mess of a film but more or less entertaining).",1271548800,3,2670,4.439918533604888

300727,5,6300274268,"While Tim Burton's rather shameless breakdancing ripoff of The Looking Glass Wars and American McGee's Alice has been shaking up the box office, you cannot deny the classic visual ecstacy of the 1951 Disney animated movie. I'm really suprised that Disney didn't bother giving the live-action sequal/reboot a different title, at least to seperate it from the original. Although the more recent film seemed like Disney was just rehashing their Return To Oz premise but with Lewis Carroll's work. But, it is still impossible not to enjoy their classic first shot at it.

Taking place in England(probably in the late-19th Century), young Alice is bored out her mind listening to her sister trying to teach her history. She then follows a slightly anthropomorphic White Rabbit down a hole, but instead of ending up in Bugs Bunny's place, she enters a ""dimension of sight and sound"". After having emotional problems with a chatty doorknob, she washes up on the shores of Wonderland. She's then thrust into a caucas race, forced into a dream sequence by pushy twins, wrecks the Rabbit's house, and gets pestered by pushy flowers, all while having some serious height issues. Fortunately, a poetic caterpillar gives her some good mushrooms(?), and Alice manages to stabilize her size. The enigmatic Cheshire Cat then leads her to the highlight of the movie, the Mad Tea Party(you can't not love the Doormouse freaking out!). After a little more wandering around amongst the bizarre forest animals, Alice does something that most Disney heroines do, and realizes that her own world was better after all, and decides to try and get home. The Cheshire Cat shows up again and leads her to the loudmouthed Queen of Hearts who has a serious decaptiation fetish. Instead of getting her head chopped off, Alice is given the weirdest trial outside of Judge Judy. She then proceeds into the craziest Benny Hill-styled chase in animated film history, and wakes up because the whole thing was just a dream(or was it?).

For the lucky 13th of Disney's full-length cartoon movies, this broke alot of molds for them. First off, it was actually a meltdown of more than one book, while being mostly from the Alice In Wonderland book, there are segments from Through The Looking Glass too, but they manage to bring it together in a coherent way, which is suprising considering the source material. The other great aspect of it was their use of allowing the visual elements and music tell most of the story.

300767,5,6300274268,"Like many other Disney Classics such as Fantasia, Bambi and Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland was not a smash success when it premiered in 1951. Adapted from the famous books from Lewis Carroll, the movie has an inmense challenge to please fans of the books and moviegoers in general. While it failed in its initial run, Alice has now grown in popularity and now it is regarded like a Disney Classic with some of the best animation that had ever come from the studio.

While not a straight adaptation of the Lewis Carroll's books (which Disney film is?), Alice in Wonderland takes what works in screen and transforms it in an amazing environment. Wonderland is truly an accomplishment in animation as are the characters that populated it. Full of bright colors you have some of the best artwork that has come from Disney before or since. The humor is great, the characters are memorable and the story maintains you hooked up most of the time. The problem with Alice is the pacing. While some sequences like the Mad Tea Party are spectacular, others like the Tulgey Wood one is a downer and detracts viewers from the whole experience. Still, the movie does more right than wrong and is non-sensical creative enteratinment that will delight everyone. I liked the Tim Burton version, but the Walt Disney version has something more magical and whimsical that makes it superior in every regard to its live-action counterpart.

Finally, Disney released Alice in Wonderland on Blu-Ray commemorating its 60th anniversary and what a release it is!!!

Video & Audio

WOW! WOW! WOW!, that's all I can said for the video quality of Alice. Disney has really outdone itself with this restorarion. The picture is inmaculate, bright, clear with no artifacts or compression issues whatsoever. Colors literally pop out the screen. A magical transfer for a magical film.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also a great audio if not spectacular. But, you can't expect a 60 year old film to hear like Inception. Still, this lossless mix is very appropiate for the film and is far superior than previous remixes.

Bonus Features:

You have all the DVD carry overs like the ""Reflections on Alice"" featurette, deleted scenes, trailers, art galleries, ""An Hour in Wonderland"" program now in HD and much much more.

New to this release is one of the best state-of the art documentaries called: ""Through the Keyhole: A companion's guide to Wonderland"". Much like the ""Inside Walt's Story Meetings"", this documentary delves on everything that concerns the production of the film and its releation with the book. We have Carroll's historians, Disney's historians and Disney animators who talk about who was Lewis Carroll, why he wrote the book and all the producion of the Disney film. An excellent piece that nobody should miss. In addition we have a live-action reference footage and a pencil test which are introduced by Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of Alice), you also have a Walt Disney color introduction and an interactive game.

A DVD is also offered and while it looks great, its vastly inferior to the quality of the BD.

Closing Thoughts:

With each passing year, it seems that Alice grows in reputation and deservely so. The film is really an amazing journey though imagination. With spectacular (and I mean SPECTACULAR) picture and sound and a great amount of bonus features, including a fantatstic documentary, Alice in Wonderland on BD is highly recommended to everyone.",1264550400,,3445,4.953206239168111
300768,1,6300274268,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

Very simply, this movie is a mess.  It overdoes its cute quotient, and summarily dismisses the darker elements of Lewis Carroll's original book.  If not for the insistent marketing muscle Disney can throw behind this misfire, it would barely be remembered today.

With the voice talents of Kathryn Beaumont(Disney's much better ""Peter Pan""), Ed Wynn(""Mary Poppins""), and Verna Felton(Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty""), this movie should have been much better than it is.  It is sunk by passionless, directionless storytelling which only vaguely resembles its superior source material.  Additionally, an unwelcome feeling of boredom begins to creep in AFTER Alice gets to Wonderland.  Where was the creativity Walt Disney had mustered just the previous year for ""Cinderella?""  This whole effort feels like he wanted to do it simply because ""Alice in Wonderland"" was a great fairytale he had not yet adapted at that point.

For a much better adaptation, search out the 1985 TV production ""Alice in Wonderland.""  It gives a fuller account of Lewis Carroll's story, and features a wonderful cast for its era.  It is also currently on DVD, and done in live action.  As for this movie, don't bother with it.",1264291200,6,1212,5.190721649484536

It has been years since I've read the book, which is up next on my list, and I've never seen the film.  My grandson Noah watched it with me, and his giggles and exclamations told me how delightful this experience was for him.

I am sure that the movie, like the book, is full of symbolism that certainly escaped me in my childhood, and which my grandson was not noticing, either.

But in this moment, I felt like simply enjoying the playful creatures.  Instead of being upset by growing larger and smaller, or by the strange playing cards that danced, Alice was obviously living in the moment, simply exclaiming ""Curiouser and curiouser.""

Living in a world that defies the logic that we are accustomed to reminds me of the society in which we now live.  Perhaps this tale is a statement about our world and Alice's response to the events and creatures she encounters could be a lesson of sorts.

It shows.

Disney's Alice is not the critical observer Carroll created at all. She is indistinguishable from all of that era's Disney heroines - helplessly feminine and mindless, but sweet. Thank goodness everyone has moved on.

Unfortunately this is a film that (like Wuthering Heights) had yet to be made. But maybe that's not so bad. Alice is all about narrative, nonsense, and a subtle humor that makes the book suitable for reading at any age.

300897,4,6300274268,"One day while Alice (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) is trying to pay attention to her lessons, she sees a White Rabbit (Bill Thompson) go by.  This is no ordinary White Rabbit, however.  He's looking at his pocket watch and worrying about being late.  Curious, Alice follows him only to fall down a hole and land in Wonderland.

And what sort of place is Wonderland?  It's a place where anything and everything can talk.  Besides the animals, we've got a talking doorknob.  Eating and drinking can make Alice grow and shrink.  As she tries to follow the White Rabbit and find out where he is going, she meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee (J. Pat O'Malley), joins an Unbirthday Party with the Mad Hatter (Ed Wynn) and the March Hare (Jerry Colonna), has a couple run ins with the Cheshire Cat (Sterling Holloway), gets lost in a strange wood, and has plays crochet with the Queen of Hearts (Verna Felton).  Will she ever get home?

It had been years since I'd seen this, so I had forgotten just how many songs there are in the movie.  Just about every character sings one at some point.  But there is a reason you don't remember most of them.  They're just okay.

Really, this movie is just a series of adventures loosely held together by the White Rabbit.  While that works for the books this movie is based on, it doesn't work quite as well here.  I tend to get bored before we meet up with the Queen.  Still, there are several funny scenes and several enjoyable songs.

Honestly, I enjoyed it more then I remember enjoying it.  The kids will particularly love this wacky tale.",1229040000,,1572,4.55
300898,4,6300274268,getting a original alice in wonderland is no easy task and there is a very good reason this is a excellent movie and definitely a most own classic,1226793600,,146,4.25
300899,5,6300274268,"Early on in Walt Disney's career, he had wanted to tell the story of Alice in Wonderland. As early as 1923 he had begun a series of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/short-films/dp/B000ATQYUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">short films</a>, which featured a young girl in the role of Alice and integrated her live-action performance with animation. So it's no surprise that he wished to make a full-length film based upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-Carroll-s-classic-stories/dp/0517220776/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis Carroll's classic stories</a>. What is a surprise is that, in 1951 when the film was finally released, Walt Disney was extremely disappointed. He felt that the film lacked an emotional center and that the characters were weak and unmemorable. Perhaps his discontentment was caused by his high expectations or maybe Walt simply didn't understand that the film was a masterpiece, but whatever the reason for his disliking the film, it has gone on to become a classic (of all of the films made while Walt Disney was alive this,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella/dp/B0007Z9R7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeping-Beauty/dp/B0013ND30M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeping Beauty</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/101-Dalmatians/dp/B000YERP2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">101 Dalmatians</a>&nbsp;are my favorites).

But of all the film adaptations inspired by the Alice books, this is one of the most faithful to the spirit and essence of the books despite the many changes to chronology and the deletion of many sequences. Disney's Alice in Wonderland is a delightful, song-filled and beautifully animated adventure into a world of nonsense and absurdity.

The story begins with Alice, who's grown tired of her lessons in history, daydreaming of a world of her own; a world where flowers talk, where animals behave like people and people behave like fools, a world where the laws of physics wouldn't apply. Suddenly her fantasy is intruded upon by a white rabbit, dressed in his finest and carrying an umbrella and pocket watch, who frantically intones, ""I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!"" Intrigued, for she has never met a talking rabbit before, Alice runs after the White Rabbit and crawls into his rabbit hole. Within the dark confines of the hole, Alice blindly progresses until she finds herself plummeting into a dark abyss. She falls and falls and falls, all the while taking notice of her strange surroundings. When she finally lands she continues her pursuit of the White Rabbit until she comes to a door. The Doorknob insists that Alice is much too big to fit through such a tiny door, so he suggests that she drink from the bottle on the table, which appears out of nowhere, and then will change size. Alice drinks from the bottle and shrinks until she's just the right height to fit through the door when the Doorknob tells her that he is locked and that the key is on the table far above them. This is remedied when a box of cookies magically appear and when Alice takes a bite she grows taller than ever before. Though she can now reach the key, she's no longer able to fit through the door and thus she begins to cry. Soon her tears form an ocean and when Alice drinks from the bottle and shrinks again, she lands in this ocean where she is eventually carried to shore. Now her adventures really begin as she meets one bizarre character after another. First she meets the sea captain, Dodo Bird and then the mischievous brothers Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Soon she catches up to the White Rabbit only to face greater obstacles. She encounters talking flowers who think she's a common weed, an erudite caterpillar that gives her lessons in grammar, and she meets the mysterious Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. She discovers a kingdom of playing cards that are ruled over by the cruel Queen of Hearts, who demands obedience or else threatens beheading. Alice's Wonderland becomes a surreal nightmare and she barely manages to escape the only way she knows how, by waking up.

This DVD contains a glorious restoration of the film as well as numerous bonus features including a Virtual Wonderland Party, two Sing Along Songs, Adventures in Wonderland set-top game, a newly discovered Cheshire Cat song, and the classic Mickey Mouse cartoon, Thru the Mirror. Also included is Walt Disney's first televised program One Hour in Wonderland, two theatrical trailers, two television introductions by Walt Disney, a behind the scenes featurette, an excerpt from the Fred Waring Show, deleted songs and storyboard sequence, and an art gallery.
With all of these features this DVD deserves a place on your shelf of Disney favorites. However Walt Disney Home Entertainment has discontinued this wonderful 2-disc Masterpiece Edition of Alice in Wonderland so if you are fortunate enough to come across a copy, I would urge you to buy it as this will in all likelihood be the final DVD release of the film.

However, the movie consists of several episodes which don't blend together very smoothly. And the characters Alice meets are nearly all really weird or nasty, which is not very appealing to a young child. (I don't see how a walrus tricking baby clams to leave their mother, only to be eaten, is good child entertainment). We have bought several other Disney classics which our daughter enjoys more. But she did like this one to a certain extent, as she sympathized with Alice.

The songs in this movie were not as catchy as those in other Disney productions, such as Peter Pan and Cinderella.

There is a strong irony to this movie, as Disney was all about creating magical fantasy worlds, and Alice in Wonderland is about how a fantasy world can be bizarre, sad, and ultimately dangerous. Wonderland is not wonderful at all.",1209686400,,974,4.86144578313253

Well, widescreen was pretty much non-existent at the time this film came out and the first film Disney did for widescreen theaters was Lady and the Tramp, this movie was never widescreen.

That aside this is truly a Disney classic, it has a great cast of characters and follows a somewhat skit style in that the film is mostly seperated in to individual encounters, each one as entertaining as those before it. There's some musical portions and comedic portions which usually border on the wierd side of the comedy spectrum, but not in a bad way.

The story is used more as a means to facilitate the encounters rather than serve as a focus for the audience, which actually works quite well in making the film enjoyable but not overly dramatic. The animation is very well done for its day and it has a few decent extra's that consist mostly of old TV spots and shows from when Alice was released.",1203120000,2,1073,4.525773195876289

300978,5,6300274268,"One of the best of the Golden Age of Disney, Alice in Wonderland remains a delight for all ages.  Unlike recent Disney films using computer generated images, Alice was created by hand. Beautifully drawn, one frame at a time, by true artists who could create subtle emotion on the faces of the most nonsensical creatures.  This was true artistic talent, something sadly gone now from Disney Studios.  One of the most likeable things, besides the witty story, the absolutely whacky characters and the endless movement from one crazy situation to another, is the fact that unlike all of the Disney films in the past 20 years, the film makers do not PREACH their own agenda at you.  How quickly have films like Pocohontas and Squanto, rife with holier-than-thou moralizing about a Utopian world despoiled by inherently evil and stupid western males, passed to the second or even third tier of forgettable Disney fims.  Alice in Wonderland remains at the top with films like Pinnochio for one reason, they entertain. Unlike the boring, preachy, agenda riddled and UNFUNNY ""cartoons"" presented to kids today, here is a funny feast of escapism that with cause your kids to actually laugh while having their imaginations set free.",1192579200,4,1222,5.0

300980,5,6300274268,"`Alice in Wonderland' is a story about nonsense.  It makes this very clear within the first few moments.  Alice wants her world to be filled with nonsense, talking flowers and cats, nothing is what it is, what's that is this and what's this is that.  Knowing this makes following and appreciating `Alice in Wonderland' possible because it really has no clue as to which direction it's going.  Nothing really fits together, there's no rhyme and or reason to the sequences of events, to the disorder within Alice's world, and if the audience isn't aware of the concept behind this cartoon they may find themselves a little turned off.  I find this one of the most fascinating of Walt Disney's cartoons just because of the sheer magnitude of its cascade of creations.  Everything within Alice's world is intriguing and interesting and color (literally and figuratively) and it provides one fun, spellbinding good time.

Alice gets her world of nonsense when she spots a white rabbit with a clock complaining about being late for something.  She, out of pure curiosity, follows him into a world unlike any she's ever known.  From the moment she crawls into the rabbit hole till she escapes the clutches of the evil Queen of Hearts the story is just about all over the place.  Alice meets a slew of interesting characters, legendary in the world of Disney.  She meets Tweedledee and Tweedledum who tell her the cautionary tale of the Walrus and the Carpenter in a warning of her growing curiosity.  She meets the Cheshire Cat who leads her in directions unbecoming.  She meets the singing flowers of the field who mistake her for a weed and the strange Caterpillar who smokes himself into a butterfly.  She comes across the Mad Hatter and March Hare who are busy celebrating their un-birthdays to help Alice find her rabbit.  And then of course we have the Queen of Hearts and the ultimate showdown between her and Alice.

With everything that goes on in `Alice in Wonderland' I'm tempted to say there really is no moral, which is usually consistent with Walt Disney films.  If there is a moral it's that we all need a little order in our lives, but even that could be a stretch.  In fact, `Alice in Wonderland' is really nothing more than good fun.  It's entertaining to everyone, even myself, and it's sure to be a favorite amongst the little ones.  It's the first cartoon I bought for my daughter and I hope as she gets older it becomes one of her favorites.  I have yet to read the novels by Lewis Carroll but from what I hear this cartoon adaptation is a good comparison, which may explain for it's strangeness to a degree.  This is actually based on two of his novels, `Alice in Wonderland' & `Through the Looking Glass'.  I'm anxious to know what a modern adaptation would look like.  Until that day we have this classic masterpiece to watch and rewatch again and again.",1190073600,3,2872,4.675298804780876

(Or down the rabbit hole).

Alas, Disney has yet again come to the ultimate rescue for the children's book story lovers in us all. After I've finished reading the original book of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland, and Through The Looking-Glass, I am always drawn to constant re-watching of this animated version.

I admit, I am a Disney fan to begin with, and ""wonder"" just how picky am I, since most of his animations seem to please me.

Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is no exception, and I love the storybook look of it on the silver screen, or television. I like all the zaniness, the madcap humor, the ""curious"" adlibs, and great use of animation and color techniques. I remember Mr. Disney did apologize for this production because it had no ""heart."" He should really look at the last fifteen minutes. . .there are plenty of hearts!

Alice character is superb, and uniquely Disney's. The Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the White Rabbit, the Queen Of Hearts, the Caterpillar, and the one and only Cheshire Cat, all work together!

There are some references to hallucinogenics, since Alice experiances outburst changes in form and size, and the appearing cup changes from various rocks and stones towards the end of the movie, suggest just that.

301046,5,6300274268,"Most films age over time. In 20 years will Titanic still be as amazing as it was in 1998? Will Jurassic Park still have people gawping open mouthed at the cinema screen? I think not. Its a rarity, but sometimes, just sometimes, there comes a movie that is timeless, magical and eternal, one such film is Alice in Wonderland.

It seems to me, when watching most Disney films, that Walt Disney had an evil masterplan to mess with the minds of children, young and old. Dumbo is a film about an outsider, Pinocchio is a film about a freak child who cannot stop lying. Walt only made these films family viewing through constantly having a moral ending. Dumbo can fly and Pinocchio is rewarded for risking his life to save another, however, these moral endings do not disguise the fact that, at times, Disney films were quite peculiar.

Alice in Wonderland on the surface is a dreamlike fantasy about a child nodding off and visiting a wonderful wonderland where flowers sing, caterpillars smoke and rabbits talk. However, this film is not about the surface values, its is about the dark, seedy undertones that exist beneath the aesthetic surface.

Below its surface lies a wealth of wholly unlikeable and unhelpful creatures. Aside from the King of Hearts, each character only serves to hinder Alice in her attempts to come to terms with her warped dream. The Cheshire Cat is responsible for putting Alice in court, the White Rabbit wants to have Alice destroyed when he finds her at his home, the flowers shun Alice when they incorrectly perceive her to be a common garden weed, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare also shun Alice for no reason whatsoever, this list is as long as the tunnel that leads Alice into her Wonderland.

To look back at the film nowadays, one could surmount that the ending is nothing more than a cop-out. She dreamt it all along is nothing more than saying, here, we'll give you licence to create a magical world, no boundaries because it all exists inside a young girls mind.

It is for these warped reasons and the context of what the film represents or least what it should represent that I absolutely adore it. Walt Disney might have had a masterplan to screw with the minds of his children, but I say, good luck to him.

Sleep is only a state of mind, it's what happens in this state of mind that really matters. Or at least, what mattered to Walt.

For material that does not lend itself very easily to cinema, this is a pretty good adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" with some enjoyable characters and sequences. It succeeds, at least in a basic way, in capturing part of the manic but imaginative nature of Lewis Carroll's story.

Much of the language, poetry, and ideas that make the original story so captivating cannot really be conveyed very easily in a movie, and so it would be nearly impossible for any cinema version of Alice to be completely satisfying to those who love the book. Instead, this version simply tries to make the characters come to life, and to use the animation to recreate the feel, if not the depth, of Alice's experience.

The animation drives most of the movie, and at times it is pretty imaginative. Some of the voices work very well, too, with the likes of Ed Wynn and Sterling Holloway fitting the animated characters quite well.

Carroll's stories are so enchanting and creative that it is no surprise that there have been so many efforts through the years to capture the magic of the Alice stories on film. None of the cinema versions has yet come close to matching the books, yet the material itself has made most of them worth watching. In this one, the overall production has a definite Disney style to it, which makes it different from the original, but as a movie it works pretty well.

The Masterpiece Edition (playable only for NTSC or Multi-Region DVD Players, unfortunately) has some terrific extras, and this version is definitely the most complete Alice in Wonderland experience.

I remember feeling a bit disappointed at how dry and colourless they looked, being a really big fan of the Disney animated film at the time. If I'm honest about it, this animation is probably somewhere in my top 25 favorite movies.

The film's loosely based on Lewis Carrol's book ""Alice in Wonderland"" with a twist of ""Through the Looking Glass"" and a sprinkling of unique but just as curious characters (like the Doorknob, the bircage bird and the dog with a broom for a head). There's lots I like about this film: the rich colours, the motion, the look of the characters, the wordplays and quotable lines, Kathryn Beaumont's Alice voice, all sorts of things. The music is probably my favorite in a Disney film as well. Quite a few classic tunes, I reckon, some silly, some pretty, all fun to listen to. Some of my favorite songs are ""I'm Late, I'm Late!"", ""How Do You Do And Shake Hands"", ""Walrus and the Carpenter"", ""A Very Happy Unbirthday"", ""Painting the Roses Red"", but I like them all really.

301074,4,6300274268,"The story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.

Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.

Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled ""drink me"" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.

Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing ""Alice in Wonderland"" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.

Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.

I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.

For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches ""Fantasia"" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.

This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!",1151884800,9,3486,4.737541528239203

Alice realizes that something has happened, but is not able to handle all this nonsense, which in fact are just a product of her own mind.

So it's odd that so many of Alice's scenes are pop culture even when it didn't have the warmest welcome on release. Granted we're not talking Disney's masterpiece level but still, it's quite a quirky movie.

Alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water. She follows it and stumbles down a long hole and enters the world of Wonderland. She ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, talking flowers and the White Rabbit.

Even though it's a film unto itself, many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they're just pop culture iconic scenes. And of course the Matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery. The film however didn't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd. It's even written Walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down.

This is probably the most atypical film Disney's released, although other films such as Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis are quite different. While those 2 were pretty devoid of characters breaking out into song, Alice has a bunch of songs. The imagery of course is odd as we get walking pencils, talking flowers, tears turning into raging waters and a cat who has a habit of disappearing. You can obviously tell why critics couldn't understand it. It's still cited as one of Disney's more better ""smart"" films such as Fantasia.

You should check it out? Of course but word of caution: by no means are you going to see a quintessential Disney classic but still you'll probably like it and enjoy it...probably.",1140912000,2,1997,4.7298850574712645
301079,4,6300274268,"Thank God for Disney releasing completely restaured Dvds of its greatest classics!

Alice is one of the best movies Disney released during its Golden Years. The dvd treatment here is fantastic: the colors are bright, image sharp as ever.

Alice is bored with the real world, and she wants things to be a bit different. To her surprise, she finds a running rabbit wearing a red coat, and carrying a big watch. She decides to follow him, out of mere curiosity. The rest of the story is very well known to everyone, but this DVD makes it very fresh and enjoyable. The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is well... the Oyster scene. It is a bit off topic and doesn't quite fit with the rest of the story. Also, the Ugly Duchess was not included in the film, which is one of my favorite characters from the book. They should have cut out the Oyster story instead!

However, this dvd is a MUST HAVE for sure.",1140739200,2,912,4.352941176470588
301080,4,6300274268,"In the mid 90's, Disney released a lavish laserdisc box set of Alice In Wonderland, which included all kinds of bonus materials, song demos, radio programs, galleries, and more. Much of that material has made it onto this new wonderful DVD treatment of Alice In Wonderland, but it's disappointing to know what was left off. But first, some words on what IS on the DVD.

The centerpiece is a new beautifully restored and remastered transfer of the movie. All previous VHS and DVD releases pale in comparison to this DVD's gorgeous transfer. Colors pop out, the image is clean, clear, sharp, and pristine. It's been given the same care as many of their more popular films.

Disc 1 contains the Mickey Mouse cartoon ""Thru The Mirror,"" sing-alongs, a Virtual Wonderland Party, and a great deleted song titled ""I'm Odd.""

Disc 2 contains the real meat. The 1950 TV special ""One Hour In Wonderland"" is presented complete with Coca Cola advertisements. It's a wonderful nostalgic look at classic TV. Other TV excerpts are included, as well as the ""Operation Wonderland"" theatrical featurette, trailers, the 1920's ""Alice's Wonderland"" short, galleries, and deleted songs.

However, a lot of material from the LD box set has been left off of this DVD release:

* ""Alice in Wonderland"" BBC Radio Broadcast of July 4, 1951.
One Hour radio dramatization with Walt Disney and Kathryn Beaumont.

* BBC Christmas Radio Broadcast (1951)
Pre-recorded in California for broadcast by the BBC at Christmastime in 1951, this show features Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of Alice) and Walt Disney, who also provides the voice of Mickey Mouse. It was recorded as separate segments that introduced songs from classic Disney movies. The material included for presentation here (the segments setting up the songs) is all that's known to survive of this show.

Disney's omission of these features is unfortunate. However, what has been included is a wonderful look at the making of the film, and the film is presented beautifully. I still recommend this DVD for fans of the film.

EDIT: This DVD has been locked up in the Disney Vault as of January 31, 2008, so make sure to pick it up while you still can. Currently, Disney has not announced a re-release, and based on Disney's past history of putting 2-Disc sets in the vault in favor of overly fluffy single-disc reissues, I can't currently predict whether we're in for an improved 2-Disc set or a light and fluffy single-disc reissue along the veins of Tarzan's ""Special Edition"" DVD and the recent reissues of titles like Robin Hood and The Aristocats. Not to mention the rumor about Disney adding Alice to the Platinum Edition line. However, when a DVD of a Disney catalogue title like Alice goes into the vault, it's almost always because of an upcoming reissue, so it shouldn't be unavailable for long. I'll post more updates and details as I get them. Hopefully they're planning a new 2-Disc set with a making-of documentary and some of those missing special edition laserdisc bonus materials.",1138579200,5,4629,4.817380352644836

The pink elephant scene in Dumbo, the entire Fantasia and Alice, what were Walt and his buddies smoking? I know the acid heads loved to drop some and watch Fantasia.

I can watch Snow White and Pinocchio over and over again, but this movie drives me insane. Maybe I'm too cerebral?

The quality of the filmmaking is, of course, stellar and second to none.",1136764800,3,469,4.318181818181818
301101,4,6300274268,"As a film ""Alice in Wonderland"" has always been in the bottom 10 of Disney animated features for me(high on the bottom ten).  Not for technical reasons or characters.  I guess I never liked how abruptly this film ends.  She wakes up from her freaky dream...  ...film over.  I think I actually enjoy it more as I grow older but the end just always bugged me.

However, as a DVD package this is the best feature laden production second only to the ""Snow White"" release a few years back.  I really don't want to talk about the films merits.  That's important but I doubt you don't know if you want this film or not.  What follows is a list of the things beyond the actual film that make this an incredible DVD;

-Virtual wonderland party is live action fun for kids, and somewhat obnoxious for adults.
-""Thru the mirror"" Mickey Mouse short is a great bonus.  Another example how Walt would recycle ideas/visuals from older films into new ones.
-""I'M Odd"" ""lost"" song is OK but self indicting.  Left out for good reason (I think).  Not fully animated either.
-Sing alongs are...  ... sing alongs.  No big deal.
-Set top game is easy and has disapointing results.  Oh well.

Thats disc one.

DISC TWO:

-Dispite the description, ""One Hour In Wonderland"" is a full hour TV special complete with Coka-Cola advertisments from 1950, not a documentary.
 THIS IS PURE GOLD!!!  I would have bought this as a DVD by itself.  Included are comedy bits by Edgar Burgen and his usual cast of dummies, Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of alice) as Alice, Walt and his Family, his famous team of animator playing in a firehouse band, a Pluto short film, clips from ""Snow White"" and the currently un-released ""Song of the South"". Finally, a ""premier"" clip from ""Alice in Wonderland"".  This is a digital time capsule into ""ancient"" television.

Honestly, there are more extras on disc two, but I got so wrapped up in the one hour special that it became second thought.  Deleted scenes and concepts are common Disney fair and the other clips of shows are less compelling than the special.  The Match card game is, again, too easy.

I hope this fills in the gaps that I have not been able to find on the other reviews here.  The point is the extras are worthy of their own disc, so this is absolutely a great buy!",1133308800,5,2285,4.534313725490196

The film is still a beautiful little story that Disney animation brought to life of Lewis Carroll's classic tale of a little curious girl with a wide imagination called Alice. Who one day enters a world called Wonderland. And upon entering she finds herself growing up, growing small, meeting unforgettable characters such as: The Mad Hatter, The Caterpillar, The Cheshire Cat, Tweedledee/Tweedledum, The White Rabbit, and everyone's favorite mean queen The Queen of Hearts. Not to mention the talking and singing flowers & the loveable story of The Walrus & The Carpenter.

It's all about the beautiful extra's in this DVD. Generally if I'm happy with the old version of the DVD I don't buy another similar version. This was one of those exceptions - not too mention it's Disney. Mainly because it has: Thru the Mirror (my all time favorite short original Mickey Mouse feature), all sorts of games with songs & more, trivia, a new additional song, An Alice Comedy, Operation Wonderland (which is featured on the original VHS/DVD version I believe), & just tons more!

301149,5,6300274268,"Yep... why is this animated classic constantly bashed? One reason is how it ""doesn't follow the book."" As much as I hate hearing about that gripe from book fanatics, I can't say much because I myself haven't read the book. But judging from some slight criticisms, the movie may have missed more important stuff. But do kids care? Most likely not. They're just interested in this odd world that Alice stumbled upon, all the colors, and all the strange creatures.

Another reason is perhaps the most asinine statement I've heard: the movie contains ""drug references"" or ""it's about a drug trip."" Oh God, how low can some people go? Just because there's a catepillar smoking doesn't mean he's ""toking it."" Just because Alice takes a few bites of some mushrooms doesn't mean she's ""hallucinating."" Just because there's a bunch of weird things going on in this movie doesn't make it a ""stoner movie."" First of all, what made you come to this conclusion? Someone said it? You yourself watched this movie ""under the influence""? If you want a stoner movie, go watch ""Cheech and Chong's Up in Smoke"" or ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.""

Anywho... ""Alice in Wonderland"" was my sister's favorite when she was a wee lass. She learned every word and scene. I picked up on it when I was small as well, but it wasn't my favorite. Watching this now as a 19 year old bum, I see it as art. This movie is something more creative than anything Disney has ever done. Alice goes on a strange journey through a place full of wonder. And the ""it was all a dream"" theme might be played out, but it's still an amazing story to witness. Probably my favorite out of the movie is the Walrus and Oysters story. Funny and great storytelling.

The DVD is enough to keep the hardcore DVD enthusiast happy.  A couple of featurettes and a documentary as well as a Mickey Mouse short that was based on Alice's journey (yep, the mouse himself embarks on a strange journey as well). And the picture... crystal clear. It's always great to see an animated film on DVD. Everything becomes clearer and sharper, you can see every little drawn and colored detail. And the sound... hey, it's 5.1 surround sound. What more do ya want?

""Alice in Wonderland"" is a great movie for the kiddies to watch. Being a former youngster whilst watching this movie, I was in awe and dazzled by what the movie offered. It's one of my favorite Disney movies as well, ranking up with ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Lilo & Stitch,"" and others. This movie is a classic in my eyes.

Note: For all you people that still think this is a stoner movie, try this lil' trick out. Remember that lil' ""Wizard of Oz/Dark Side of the Moon"" trick? Well, if you have this movie as well as Pink Floyd's grandioso rock opera masterpiece ""The Wall""... yep, listen to Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" while watching ""Alice in Wonderland."" Here's a lil' instructional guide. Stick in the first disc of ""The Wall"" and put on pause while you load up ""Alice in Wonderland."" Right when the movie starts playing, unpause ""The Wall."" The only catch is that ""Comfortably Numb"" MUST be skipped... and of course, pause the movie when you change discs. Once done, resume. Yep... then just sit back and enjoy ""Alice in Wonderland"" like never before.

Here's some ""things"" to see if your in-sync (don't read if ya wanna be surprised):

- When Alice picks up her cat, a baby sound should be heard and ""The Thin Ice"" should sync up pretty good when Alice sings.

-""Another Brick in the Wall, pt. 1"" should start up as soon as Alice falls down that hole and descends into ""Wonderland.""",1101600000,9,3580,4.58125
301150,5,6300274268,"This animated film by Disney is a runaway best effort they ever produced. Nothing comes close to 'Alice in WOnderland' in Disney's arsenal of cartoons. Alice is superb and all the characters and creatures come to life in a way that is staggering on the limit of imagination.

The Walrus and the Carpenter (Little Oysters! Little Oysters!"")is a favorite scene as is the Mad Tea Party. Does anyone know why at the end of 'Mad Watch! Mad Watch!' there is a second of black and white while the watch dies? I had the VHS version and now the DVD Masterpiece and it still has that one second of film in which it goes black and white. Oh well, the watch was two days slow anyway.

One can enjoy this adventure as a child, but adults can love this film as well. Like Rocky Horror, you can have a party and have everyone dress up as a character and pass around magic mushrooms just like Alice has. My girlfriend looks real sexy in her Alice outfit and she loves me when I dress up as Bill the Lizard.

The king of all is not the King of Hearts, but rather the catepillar. He has his magic hookah and teaches ALice all the recitals that any school girl should know. The part when Alice tries to finally decide to go home is awesome as well because Tulgi Wood is filled with an amazing assortment of creatures that would drive anyone mad. The birdcage bird is a favorite as are the umbrella vultures. The Chesire Cat is in full swing and loves the madness he lives in and is a part of.

The Queen of Hearts is a madwoman with a fetish for beheading. That'll teach you to plant the white roses by mistake! I have heard that this movie seriously bombed back in the 50's because Alice was not the heroine similar to Snow White or Cinderella. Fortunately teenagers and adults caught on and it is a favorite of the older crowd.

I love this cartoon and think it's better than Toy Story, The Little Mermaid, and Nemo combined.",1100995200,3,1908,4.333333333333333
301151,4,6300274268,"Disney's 1951 film ""Alice in Wonderland"" is one that held a strange appeal for me throughout my childhood. The Queen of Hearts literally gave me nightmares - I had dreams that I was Alice, trying to escape without losing my head - and the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter depressed me, yet I kept going back and watching it again and again. The movie fascinated me. Children love any opportunity to dream and make believe, and ""Alice in Wonderland"" has so many creative and fantastical elements that it provides an unlimited source of stimulation. Now, as an adult having recently read for the first time the books upon which the film was based, I was inspired to purchase the Masterpiece Edition of ""Alice in Wonderland"" on DVD and revisit this Disney classic.

The movie is actually based on two books by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll. ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" was published in 1865, and ""Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There"" appeared in 1871. Nowadays the two are commonly printed together in a single volume. Unfortunately, for fans of the books, the movie adaptation does not quite live up. The biggest problem with the movie is that it just doesn't make much sense. We don't understand why the things that happen to Alice happen, like why the Mad Hatter insists on changing seats all the time at the tea party, or why the bird that Alice disrupts calls her a serpent. These things are all explained in the books, but the meaning is lost in the translation to film. Still, a child is less likely to question the logic behind events in the movie, and will be more interested in the magical feeling of the story.

The other big failing of the film is that all of the witty wordplay and riddles with which Carroll's books abound are nowhere to be found. Again, this will probably be less of an issue for a child viewer, but someone who has read the books can't help but notice the gaping hole left by this omission. Carroll's books where all ABOUT wordplay and witticism. Granted, it can be difficult to transfer such literary tricks to the screen, and most children probably would not pick up on the more complicated or obscure ones anyway, but certainly some of the simpler puns could have been carried across. Alice herself is also a less impressive heroine in the movie, as the loss of wordplay detracts from our sense of her as being exceptionally bright for a seven-year-old.

My other observations about the adaptation from book to movie are fairly neutral. Disney made significant changes to the story, but this is to be expected considering the length and complexity of Carroll's books. Some episodes from the books are left out entirely, like the scenes with the Duchess, her peppery cook, and the pig baby, and also the exchanges Alice has with the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon. The order of events that were included in the movie is also switched about, particularly because of the fact that the movie combines the plots of both books. Interestingly, the Queen of Hearts in the movie is actually an amalgamation of two different characters - the Queen of Hearts from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and the Red Queen from ""Through the Looking-Glass.""

However, criticisms of the book-to-movie adaptation aside, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is still a good, solid children's animated film. It won't hold the same appeal for older audiences, but I remember how much I enjoyed watching it as a child and am sure it will continue to inspire the imaginations of today's young viewers. The movie is also a visually impressive artistic accomplishment. The animation is superb. In fact, I'd say it's one of the most vivid and lush of all of Disney's earlier films. The brightly-colored characters really stand out against the predominantly black background.

The 2-disc Masterpiece Edition DVD has a wealth of special features. Most are geared toward the child viewer, which is to be expected, but there are some pieces that even an adult will find interesting. Disc 1 offers a ""Virtual Wonderland Party"" for the kids, which is rather like an interactive television show; sing-along songs of ""The Unbirthday Song"" and ""All In A Golden Afternoon"" (the song that the talking flowers perform); an ""Adventures in Wonderland"" game which is fairly simple, being intended for children, but which I found particularly delightful because it is actually based on riddles (I thought this was a nice way to give the movie a tie-in with the wordplay of Carroll's original story); a featurette including the song ""I'm Odd,"" sung by the Cheshire Cat, which was one of at least 30 songs written for the film but never included; and the original Mickey Mouse short ""Thru the Mirror.""

Disc 2 rounds out the collection of special features with ""One Hour in Wonderland,"" Walt Disney's first TV show, hosted by Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of Alice); ""An Alice Comedy: 'Alice's Wonderland'"" which was the 1923 pilot film for a TV comedy series; an ""Operation Wonderland"" behind-the-scenes featurette from 1951; a half-hour excerpt from the Fred Waring show, which aired in 1951; numerous deleted materials, including an interesting featurette about a song originally written for ""Alice in Wonderland"" but which was left out and adapted for use in ""Peter Pan"" in 1953; an art gallery; theatrical trailers from 1951 and from the 1974 re-release; and TV introductions from 1951 and 1964.",1099699200,6,5437,4.8979370249728555

301172,4,6300274268,"Disney's version of Alice In Wonderland has gotten some flak over the years for being too simplistic, and not faithful to Lewis Carroll's original story.  I don't have much of a problem with the movie, other than the fact that it moves a bit too quickly and there are a few too many songs (this coming from a huge fan of musicals).  I think my favorite scenes have to be the ""Walrus and the Carpenter"" number, the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, and the caterpillar with the hookah.

As for the DVD itself, it's filled with loads of historical artifacts, but the first disc is geared towards youngsters only.  Aside from the ubiquitous 452 trailers that Disney likes to preview before the movie starts, there are a couple of singalong songs (""The Unbirthday Song"" and ""All In The Golden Afternoon""), a couple of virtual games, a newly discovered Cheshire Cat song called ""I'm Odd,"" which was left out of the film for a good reason (it's simply not that memorable) and, best of all for the adults, the Mickey animated short Thru The Mirror.

As for disc two, we have a promotional TV special from 1950 called ""One Hour In Wonderland,"" which shows clips from various Disney films and features Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergen.  It's only mildly entertaining, but as a historical document, absolutely fascinating (and it contains perhaps the only scenes from Song Of The South that will ever make it to DVD, as Disney keeps handling that politically incorrect film with kid gloves).  We also have one of Disney's earliest cartoons, An Alice Comedy: Alice's Wonderland, in which young Virginia Davis finds herself trapped in a cartoon world filled with lions.  The last of the major specials is an excert from the 1950s TV show, The Fred Waring Show, featuring Stanley Holloway and Kathryn Beaumont (the voices of the Cheshire Cat and Alice, respectively).  It's not very good, but it's nice to have.

After that we have a couple of theatrical trailers, a couple of TV introductions made by Uncle Walt himself, a huge gallery of storyboards, backgrounds, and character drawings, and finally, a couple of deleted scenes, one featuring a song that was cut from Alice but made it into Peter Pan a couple of years later (with different lyrics of course) and the other a daydream Alice has.  Lastly, a few demos of songs that didn't make the final cut.

All in all, a pretty good DVD.  But Disney, where's the commentary?  Is Alicesuch a minor blip on your historical radar that it doesn't warrant a yaktrack?  After all, the movie's only 75 minutes long, and Kathryn Beaumont's still alive to share her experiences.  It's the only disappointing thing about an otherwise wonderful DVD.

301173,1,6300274268,"I was so disappointed after reviewing this with my 3 year old grandson. For some unknown reason, ""they"" decided to make this a more contemporary version. It's too fast, jumps all over the place, too many animation details, redone characters don't fit the story, the original songs are revised, cut short, and hyped-up, to give just a few examples. I am at a complete loss to understand why this wonderful story had to be tinkered with. I sure hope they don't do this to Bambi, Pinoccio, or the original Pooh. The reason these originals are so valuable, (especially Pooh), is that the characters have personalities. They relate to one another and they take time to have a conversation and work on mutual problem solving or just having simple fun. They teach a moral that doesn't get lost in the quest of being ""modern"". My three grandchildren, age 3, age 3 1/2, and age 5, are inthralled with the originals. They can even sing, completely, every song in each.",1090627200,11,958,4.708333333333333
301174,4,6300274268,"I just spent a couple of hours looking at this wonderful movie and the extra features.  The aptly named Masterpiece Edition is worth every penny, and like The Matrix, should be included in any movie collection, whether you have a child to hide behind or not.
Beautifully adapted and animated from Lewis Carroll's highly imaginative, high-trippin' classic, the imagery and illustrated puns amaze and amuse, especially the little things like the rocking-horse fly, the bread-and-butter flies, the vultures, the pencil and hammer birds, the momeraths, and the bird in the tree (Queenie Leonard) yelling ""Ser-pennnnnt !""
The animators drew each frame based on the portrayals by the actors voicing the parts, and the stand-outs are Kathryn Beaumont as Alice, Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter, Verna Felton as the Queen of Hearts, Bill Thompson as the White Rabbit, and the very flexible and versatile J. Pat O'Malley as Tweedle Dum, Tweedle Dee, the Walrus AND the Carpenter, in one of the best scenes in the movie.
With fourteen songs, this is the most musical Disney around, but unfortunately, the songs are not very easy to sing along to, making me sound like William Hung every time I try to impress people with my thorough knowledge of the lyrics.
There are lots of interesting tidbits in the extras, such as the discarded Cheshire Cat song, and the fact that one of the songs was later re-worded for Peter Pan.  There are other links between Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, but you'll have to watch the extras to find out just what, cause I'm not telling.
For those who don't want to watch the previews at the beginning of the DVD, just press ""Menu"" and get plugged directly into Wonderland.

Though the movie it contains is not neccessarily Disney's most readily accessible title (except for during the sixties when they found out it had gained popularity on college campuses, know-what-I-mean, nudge-nudge) it is two discs of pure Disney magic.
Setting aside the feature, which we all know is one of the best adaptations of Lewis Carroll's works (and if not the most accurate, certainly the most ""watchable,"" as it is just dark enough to keep that edge but...well, let me put it this way: have you SEEN another version of ""Through the Looking Glass?"" I need a stiff drink before getting into that) the real highlight of this disc is the special features.
Two TV introductions by Walt, a 1950's making-of featurette, vintage television programs includin the historic ""One Hour in Wonderland"" the first Disney TV show, a whole album's worth of demos for songs that were never used, concept art galleries and more. This disc is an essential for anyone, like me, who is in love with Disney animation.
If for no other reason than the ""One Hour in Wonderland"" show features a clip from ""Song of the South."" It's worth buying the whole disc just for that, since it's the closest that movie's ever going to come to a DVD release in this lifetime.",1084924800,51,1300,4.681222707423581

He took Lewis Carrol's novel and turned it into a spectrum of silly madness that really is unlike Disney.  Alice is unlike your typical Disney hero, because unlike Cinderella and Snow White she is only twelve.  Disney's version of Wonderland is very neat to watch.  The characters are all wonderful and the voice talents are really superb.  The Cheshire Cat, The Queen of Hearts, and The Mad Hatter, are some of the hilights of the film.

But to sit down and watch this thing is a real treat. The animation is beautiful and the art direction is stunning. I enjoy the Disney movies, but this one really stands out as far as I am concerned. I have never read the original works that the film was based on, but for my money, this picture feels cohesive and whole it's design and animation - which I feel plays a big part (subconsciously for most people) in the overall enjoyment of a film.

Cinderella 2?  At least twenty different versions of 101 Dalmations?  Lets wake up here.  Disney used to put out some fantastic films, and Alice In Wonderland is right there at the top.  It's the most experimental and disturbing of the Disney features.  It's also hilarious!  Naturally it doesn't follow the book(s) 100%, but I don't think I've ever seen an adaptaion of Alice that has(if Terry Gilliam got ahold of the rights, THEN you'd see something spectacular!).  Some reviewers whine about how this is ""boring"", ""confusing"" and ""inappropriate for children.""  Grow up, will ya?  It's Alice In Wonderland, not Eraserhead!  What kind of adult is ""confused"" by a Disney film that my daughter can follow?  Believe me, this movie will NOT corrupt or traumatize your child.  You have the Stanley Runk guarantee on that.  Unless your child is a genius and more educated in the ways of the world than you are, they will not pick up on any kind of drug references.  And it won't inspire your daughter to smoke a cigar if she sees a talking walrus doing it.  My daughter and I watch this all the time.  We laugh, we sing, we quote it, we have more fun with this film than any other Disney film.  To my knowledge she hasn't started smoking cigars yet.  So put that in your hookah and smoke it, Mister!

301232,4,6300274268,"This isn't the best adaptation of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice"" stories, but it's a charming, fun film with great animated set-pieces. I'm staggered to see how beautifully the film has been restored: a comparison of the old video with the new reveals all sorts of detail in dark areas, especially backgrounds. Certain scenes now take place in day when they originally seemed to be at night! Without a doubt, this is the best restoration of a classic animated film I've ever seen.
The supplements, though, are wanting. The kiddie features are simply atrocious. The ""Virtual Tea Party"" is probably the most noxious DVD extra I have ever, ever encountered. Watch as character impressionists and a bunch of kids cavort around a tea party set, torturing the viewer with awful songs and games. ""We're Painting Our Noses Red"" is actually one of the better ones.
Other 2-disc Disney titles have similar bilge, but boast commentaries, documentaries, and restoration featurettes - none of which are on <I>Alice</i>. As a result, there is next to no modern perspective offered on the film itself, or the twenty-year quest to get it made. Aside from the segments on deleted songs, casual fans are left to guess at the significance of most of the `grown-up' supplements, including TV specials and a 1923 silent short. What's here is nice, but only for those in the know.
This is a great release for fans of the film, because of the beautiful restoration. Try and find it cheap, though, because the second disc isn't worth all that much.",1076889600,16,1517,4.883720930232558
301233,5,6300274268,"Alice in Wonderland,has always been a favourite book of mine,and this Disney musical version is a brilliant adaptation. Not to mention the beautifully done animation. This new release retains the original's greatness,and throws in numerous extra goodies for children and adults alike! For example....if you like to listen in French or Spanish,the ENTIRE soundtrack is in those languages,including ALL of the songs! Kathryn Beaumont,the voice of Alice,also makes an appearance and looks as wonderful as she does in the archival footage,and leads you through some of the archive materials. For the ""kids"" there's a ""Mad Tea Party"" interactive video game,a ""match the cards"" card game,sing-a-long videos,and an escape from Wonderland quiz game. For the ""adults"" there's the rare ""Thru The Mirror"",Mickey Mouse cartoon,( Which inspires many Card routines for ""Alice"" ),and the very first Disney Television Show (""An Hour In Wonderland"" with Walt Disney, Kathryn Beaumont,Bobby Driscol,Edgar Bergen,Charlie McCarthy,and Knucklehead Smith ). For ""the collector"" there's the trailers,numerous art galleries,a collection of song demos,storyboards for a couple of deleted scenes,""Operation Wonderland"" ( A 1950 behind the scenes featurette ),a rare original ""Alice"" comedy from the 1930's,Walt's two televsion intros. from 1954 and 1964,and Kathryn Beaumont & Sterling Holloway performing selections on ""The Fred Waring Show"". Also of note,""An Hour In Wonderland"",a black and white show featuring excerpts from previous Disney movies,cuts to colour when those parts are shown.( Also of note,this DVD features the FIRST release of an excerpt from ""Song Of The South""! See Uncle Remus sing ""Zip-A-Dee-Do-Dah"" in all it's glory!).
The one disappointment is the highly touted Cheshire Cat song ""I'm Odd"". Firstly,the Disney folks wrote nearly 100 songs for this film.( It was planned as far back as the early 40's.).""I'm Odd"" apparently got lost,the music score anyways. So,this DVD contains a NEW recording of that song....in other words it's NOT sung by Sterling Holloway,nor is there any lost animation to accompany it. It's even less of an ""artifact"" than the original song demos included,and frankly is a poor selling point.( This DVD would've sold without that sort of hype to begin with.)

Ever since I first saw Alice in the mid 70's, it somehow wormed it's way into my heart as my favorite Disney film, even though I had never read the original books of Lewis Carrol. First of all, the animation is some of the most beautiful and scay that Disney ever produced.

Katherine Beaumont makes quite the convincing Alice as well. Despite not having the singing voice of an angel, you can't help but love her. She gives the voice acting all she's got, and you truly belive that she's an 11 year old trapped in this funny, yet terrifying nightmare world.

The special features on the DVD are nothing short of fantastic, and over all, this 2 disc set was well worth the wait and price.

301236,4,6300274268,"The latest Disney classic to get the Masterpiece treatment on DVD, ""Alice in Wonderland"" comes as a two-disc set complete with trailers, featurettes, and a pristine transfer of the 1951 film.
""Alice in Wonderland"" is very good, of course, but pales a bit in relation to ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"". While faithful to the original source material, the film still seems a bit thin and perhaps even slightly unsatisfying. Maybe this is because the story is only somewhat linear, and of such a surreal nature that it makes viewing somewhat challenging... well, somewhat.
While there are some interesting and fun vintage featurettes and presentations related to ""Alice in Wonderland"", the biggest drawback with this set is the glaring lack of a documentary on the creation of the film. After some twenty-odd years of pre-production, plus access to star Kathryn Beaumont, you would think that there would have been enough material to put together such a ""How They Did It"" documentary, a standard extra on the other Masterpiece offerings.
On the plus side, there is an extended clip from the ""lost"" Disney classic, ""Uncle Remus"" in one of the featurettes. In recent years, Disney appears to be more and more willing to consider showing some of the politically incorrect bits from its vaults (such as in the ""Mickey Mouse in Black and White"" compliation, among others), so perhaps this new (and intellegent) attitude bodes well for the ultimate release of ""Remus."" Well, we can hope so, anyway.
While not the best of Disney, ""Alice"" is certainly worth a looksee. Some of the techniques used are still superior to the computerized fakery so prevelent in today's animation, and would be instructive to fans and creators of animated film alike.",1076284800,,1740,5.045138888888889
301237,5,6300274268,"""Alice in Wonderland"" is back on DVD, and LOADED with awesome extras! It's Disney's classic story of a little girl named Alice, who followed a white rabbit into a hole in the ground, and came out in a world of pure fantasy! All the flowers and animals sing and dance, and they're all quite mad! Alice meets one zany character after another, from a bumble-headed dodo bird and an insane Cheshire Cat, to the hookah smoking caterpillar and Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. She grows and shrinks and grows again, and eventually finds herself at the funniest tea party that ever took place! Alice soon has her fill of the madness of  Wonderland, but before she can make it home she'll have to face the Queen of Hearts. ""Off with her head!""

It's sad to hear the negative comments this film has endured since its release. Not everyone is a fan of stories that revolve around pure nonsense, but  even Walt himself never realized what a masterpiece he and his team had created when they transformed Lewis Carroll's story into their newest animated classic back in the early fifties. The film is lighthearted fun from beginning to end, full of brilliant colors and characters, all of whom are unforgettable, from the well known Cheshire Cat, to minor characters like Bill the Lizard. The animation is some of Disney's best, especially on the lead character, who really comes alive on film. The plot may be mere endurance and survival, but that's all you need in a movie that is such a feast for the eyes and ears, with more songs than any other Disney animated feature.  The lovely Kathryn Beaumont is outstanding as Alice (just as she was in the role of Wendy in Disney's Peter Pan). Sterling Holloway and Ed Wynn are brilliant as usual, and Jerry Colonna is hilarious as always in the role of the March Hare. But the real treat on this new, 2 disc edition is the special features menu. Disc one and disc two both have a nice selection. Of course, there's the expected stuff; Mickey Mouse in his classic short, ""Thru the Mirror,"" some sing-along-songs, a set top game, but they don't stop there! One of my favorite extra features was the program, ""One Hour In Wonderland,"" which I had been waiting years to see! This was a Christmastime television special sponsored by the Coca-Cola company, Walt's first TV program in fact, designed to promote the upcoming release of ""Alice In Wonderland."" It features Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Mortimer Snerd, Kathryn Beaumont in full Alice dress, Bobby Driscoll, a collection of teenage party guests, the Magic Mirror (played to perfection, as usual, by the wonderful Hans Conried), and of course, the young Walt Disney himself, accompanied by his teenage daughters. The setting is a Christmas party at the Disney Studios, where Kathryn Beaumont is the guest of honor. She and her friends are treated to a handful of clips, courtesy of the Magic Mirror, and a serving of refreshing Coca-Cola, courtesy of the Coca-Cola Company. Young Miss Beaumont is delightful, and the entire program is a wonderful piece of nostalgia I'm overjoyed to finally have in my personal collection.

The wonderful extras continue though, with ""Operation Wonderland."" This is a promotional featurette on the making of ""Alice In Wonderland."" We also get treated to some deleted material, which includes some terrific song demos for songs that didn't make it into the final cut, often for characters that didn't make it into the film. In the deleted material we get to see those characters some fans of the Alice stories missed in the film, such as the Jabberwock, the Lion, and the Mock Turtle. There's the usual, but much appreciated art gallery, a fine explanation of how one deleted song ended up making it into ""Peter Pan"" a short time later, a deleted story concept, trailers and TV introductions by Walt Disney, a new Cheshire Cat song, and even a card game set included in the DVD case. On top of all that are two more extras worth more detailed descriptions. One is the excerpt from ""The Fred Warring Show,"" a musical television show from the 50s that, in this particular episode, showcased the music of the soon to be released ""Alice in Wonderland."" Kathryn Beaumont, again in full Alice get-up, guest stars with Sterling Holloway in some live reenactments of several scenes from the film with the Fred Warring cast. The picture and sound quality on this program isn't the highest, but it's still one of the coolest extra features on the 2 disc set, if you`re into nostalgia that is. The last extra feature I'll mention is the Virtual Tea Party on Disc 1. It's mainly for kids of course, but I found it quite entertaining. There are a number of things to discover by selecting objects from the table, each object causing the party guests and hosts to play a new game or sing a new song. I suppose what I found interesting about it was the performances of the two cast members in the roles of the Mad Hatter and Alice. The Hatter was highly entertaining with his creepy Ed Wynn impersonation, and Alice, well, Alice was charming and quite a cutie. I only regret that I never found a cast list for this segment.

For the more mature audience, the second disc provides a great look into the past.

There is also several demo's of songs that didn't make it into the film, including one about the Jaberwoki for all you fans of the books. There are some brand new featurettes that are very entertaining, including From Wonderland To Neverland, about how the song, ""Second Star To The Right,"" from Peter Pan, was originally written for Alice. A few things about the special features disapointed me. The only disapointment about the special features was the newly discovered Chesire Cat song, ""I'M Odd."" Disney only found the original sheet music so they had to re-record it and the music was set to clips from the movie instead of storyboards.

There is no audio commentary, and the art gallery is severely lacking. On both the ""Snow White"" and ""Beauty/Beast"" DVD sets (and others), there is virtual corridor after virtual corridor of conceptual drawings, abandoned concepts, and background sketches enough to follow the evolution of the production and marvel at the ingenuity of the Disney artists. Most of this is arranged by character. For ""Alice,"" the stingy Disney people have arranged a couple dozen or so conceptual drawings in no discernible order with no captions or commentary. At one point, there are photos of Disney and his staff looking over mounted art and storyboards -- who am I looking at and what are they doing? What about the input of Mary Blair, whose art informs the entire production? Where are all the abandoned characters: the Lion and the Unicorn, the White Knight? In short, the story of the evolution of Disney's Alice is almost completely missing from this set. True, there is a song by the Cheshire Cat and a segment on how one song ended up in ""Peter Pan."" But anyone looking for an excursion into the world of the art of Disney's Alice will be all too disappointed (which is too bad, because the art of Disney's Alice is more creative than that for ""Beauty/Beast"") as will anyone interested in the process that goes into making a Disney masterpiece.

That the novel just happens to feature such immortal characters as the Mad Hatter and Cheshire Cat was good for masking the author's real acidic read of the British aristocracy. In eschewing Carrol's original intent, Disney gives us spectacle without substance; a series of highly imaginative, magnificently rendered vignettes that, unfortunately fail to provide a cohesive plot for dear sweet Alice to meander through. At the time of its release ""Alice"" was much criticized for having omitted many of Carrol's best characters and the truncation of his best work in the novel, ""the Jabberwacky"" is a slight few die hard Carrol-philes have forgiven Disney for since.
TRANSFER: In a word, stunning! A rich, fully saturated spectrum of color that is bold and well defined. While the previously issued DVD suffered from some picture instability and age related artifacts, this version is near pristine and to quote another Disney heroine, Mary Poppins, ""practically perfect in every way"". The audio has been cleaned up and remixed to 5.1 surround. The songs benefit richly from the remastering effort with robust spread across all five speaker channels that is quite uncharacteristic of most movies of ""Alice's"" vintage.
EXTRAS: A ton. There's a Charlie McCarthy featurette, some studio junket stuff and a few short subjects that get introduced by Katharine Beaumont - the voice of Alice. There's also the Mickey Mouse short ""Through the Looking Glass"" which was previously made available on the 'Mickey in Living Color' DVD and a really, REALLY dismal virtual adventure in Wonderland that I can't imagine appealing to anyone outside of the pre-school set. One oversight: there's no comprehensive ""making of"" of this Disney film - a genuine shame that leaves the other extras sort of out in the cold, presented without any kind of overview and underlying unity - sort of like the film itself.
BOTTOM LINE:If you've always been a fan of this movie this is definitely the version to get. For me, there's still something tragically lacking in ""Alice"" that not even a wonderland can make whole!",1075248000,3,2183,5.152112676056338

Some of the extras are great as well.  I truly didn't expect for them to rerelease this movie so soon, but I am so glad they did!  It is one of my all time favorite Disney films and very under-rated.  I can't wait for more classic Disney films to be released with restoration like this.

301287,4,6300274268,"Yup, I got it yesterday, and watched everything on it. Here's my feelings on this dvd.
The Prevews
I really liked the previews on this dvd. Mulan 2 is a great one, and so is Mary Poppins. Home on the Range is ok. There is also a preview for the Brother Bear dvd, but it is almost the same as the original theatrical preview. It also has the ""hot tub"" trailer from Lion King 1.5.
The Movie
This was a real refresher to me because I've only seen ""Alice in Wonderland"" once or twice when I was really young (like 3 or 4). My favorite part is when Alice sings ""A world of My Own"". I also like the singing flowers in ""The Golden Afternoon"" and ""The Unbirthday Song"" (I remembered both of those songs from the Sing-along tapes I would watch over and over when I was younger). Overall I liked the movie. I liked the smoking caterpillar! The only parts I didn't really like were the part with the Walrus and the Carpenter, and the croquet game followed by the Trial.
The Virtual Tea Party
I did not like this at all! I felt like I was watching an episode of Barney! The only neat thing I discovered was if you click on the index of activities, you'll see ""cookie recipies"". Click on that, and there are three recipies fro Chocolate chip, Peanut butter, and Oatmeal cookies. I like to cook, so that appealed to me.
The Sing-alongs
I really liked these since I have always loved Disney's Sing-along Songs. It's also neat beacause these sing-alongs (of ""The Golden Afternoon"" and ""The Unbirthday Song"") show the film before it was restored. Speaking of the restoration, It's WONDERFUL! They did such a great job!
The ""Alice Set Top Game""
One word, boring. This was even lamer than the tea party! It shows you, like 5 objects. Then, it asks you a question like ""What does the Mad Hatter wear on his head?"" You would then click on his hat....see, lame.
""I'm Odd""
I liked the song, but I wish they created new animation and integrated it into the film. What they did was just use their animation of the Cheshire Cat that was in the movie, and try to make it fit the new song.  The song itself though, is enjoyable and very pleasing to the ear.
""Thru the Mirror""
This Mickey mouse cartoon was cute and interesting to watch.
One Hour in Wonderland
I LOVED this! It was very enjoyable to watch. The story was, Walt had the Magic Mirror from Snow White, and he entertained the girl that voiced Alice and some other people with it by having the mirror show them parts of Disney movies and cartoons. These included, ""The Silly Song"" from Snow White, A Mickey Mouse cartoon where Mickey, Donald, and Goofy were all cleaning a big clock, Zip-a-dee-doo-dah plus a little more of Song of the South, and a Pluto cartoon where Pluto took a bone from a bulldog. After that, they showed Disney animators playing ""Jingle Bells"" with trumpets, tubas, and other wind instruments. That was very comical  . At the end, it showed ""The Unbirthday Song"" from Alice in Wonderland. Throughout the show, it also showed old advertisements for Coca-cola, and they were amusing to see as well.
The Alice Comedy
I didn't think it was very good. It just showed a real girl, going through a dull cartoon world. I thought it got boring after the first 3 or 4 min, (it's 8 minutes total).
The Original Theatrical Trailers
They were nice.
Walt's TV introductions
They were nice too.
""Operation Wonderland""
I really liked this ""Behind the scenes"" of Alice. I always look foward to this kind of stuff on Disney dvd's.
The Fred Waring Show
I liked the first part of this, where Walt talked briefly abot Snow White, Cinderella, and Alice. After that though, I didn't like it at all. It was very weird seeing the people on the show act out some of the scenes in the movie. The Cheshire cat scene was particulary weird acted out with real people.
Deleted Materials
These were very good. ""From Wonderland to Neverland-Evolution of a song was neat since ""Second Star to the Right"" was originally written for Alice with different words. ""Alice daydreams in the park"" was ok, and the ""Song demos"" were very fun to listen to.
Art Galleries
They are very nice pictures, but it would have been nice to see more.

With all of the features that will be on that DVD, people who buy this DVD now will be disappointed if they don't wait.
Disney will be including all of the ""Making of"", pre-production art, and other features that make their new ""Special Editions"" great, to this new edition.
There are three other ""Special Editions"" due in 2004 - Mary Poppins, Lilo and Stitch, and Pocahontas.  Alice will be the first released in 2004.  Also, there's the ""Platinum"" edition of Aladdin in October 2004.  Worth waiting for in my opinion. You have been warned. :-)",1070150400,89,813,4.593103448275862

I believe I once read that Walt himself had apologized to the American public for it, but that was probably the ""times"" back then.  There are so many messages and references in the film, that wrapped up around Lewis Carroll's original story with Disney's great animation that many people will agree with me...  you may love it or hate it, but it's definitely not boring.

301294,5,6300274268,"Several people claim that Disney's Alice In Wonderland has no plot. That's not true. The plot is like so: A little girl gets lost, and must find her way back home (in a dream). It is never confuisng, but weird things are supposed to happen--the whole movie is the dream of a 7 1/2 year old girl!! WEIRD STUFF IS GONNA HAPPEN!!
I love the songs in this movie! Golden Afternoon, sung by the flower bed, used to be my favorite Disney tune ever. Kathryn Beaumont has a splendid voice, perfect for Alice (and eventually
 Wendy in Peter Pan). The caterpillar may be slightly annoying, but he's still cool.
The mad hatter and march hare are very amusing. Their wild tea party is so random, that it forces Alice to claim, ""This is the STUPIDEST tea party I've ever been to."" The Queen of Hearts and the Cheshire cat are also very funny.
And this is a note to all those fussing, worrying mothers who think the scene where the ""cute"" little oysters die is, and I quote, ""inappropriate for children"": GET A LIFE!! Do you want your kids to grow up thinking that every single thing in a movie has to end happily ever after?! If you force-feed your kids the typical disney happy film, do you think they'll ever learn anything?! GEEZ!

301305,5,6300274268,"This is a most amazing film, full of colour and vision, and filled with delightful characters.
I love the psychedelic effect, which is probably a bit ahead of its time being a precursor to the 60's style.
Alice is brought to life, in an amazing way for an animated character, and she is quite appealing.
The scene opens with Alice (read by Kathryn Beaumont) lying on branch of a tree with her cat Dinah, being read a dull history lesson, by her stuffy older sister.

She begins to think about how her world would be like...before being distracted by a White Rabbit, who is late for a very important date...
The effects large and small are remarkable and no small detail is left out.
I love the way Dinah waves at her with her little paw when Alice is falling down the hole.
The hazy world of the hookah smoking Caterpillar, the crazy antics of the disappearing and reappearing Cheshire Cat, and the total whimsy of the Mad Hatter and March Hare ,are all captured exactly the way, I think, Lewis Carroll intended it to be.
Alice interacts with just the right balance to all of these characters and creatures.
You can watch this again and again, and unlike some of the other Disney movies, you always pick up something new each time.
And there are indeed lessons to be learned from this movie.
For one thing alice always persevers to get out of this Crazyland. She shows a lot of intitative in trying to do so , and never gives up.
And we can all learn from the words of the Cheshire Cat.
When Alice asks him where she should go , he replies ""That depends on where you want to get to""
We all need to first decide where we want to get to , before we decide which road to take.",1051660800,2,1673,4.328025477707007
301306,5,6300274268,"Right from the stunning (hand drawn!) opening sweep of a verdant riverbank on a lazy summer's day, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is one of the most beautifully animated of the Disney films of the 1950s. Unfortunately, this film has always been one of the most maligned in the Disney canon.
Many books on the subject of Disney's animated films will often only devote a paragraph or two to the film, and in that short paragraph it will invariably mention how ""Alice"" was a financial flop, how Walt Disney himself wasn't very fond of it, how it's a chilly film. I don't find this film chilly, I find it refreshingly free of sentiment or cliche that can often weigh down other Disney films.
To start with, we have Alice. Unlike Cinderella or Snow White, Alice has a lot of personality. Who among us hasn't been very frustrated that Cinderella just took all the abuse from her stepmother and sisters and was powerless?  Alice, on the other hand, is not one of the ""shy little violets"" and operates on more than just one emotion;  she gets mad, befuddled, disgusted, amused, angry and, best of all, she stands up to adults (how odd for the 50's) and tells them when they are being ridiculous. This film has a subversiveness that may have been unintentional in showing how the world of adults, with its rules and logic, can be purely nonsense and that a child can be the only sane person in the lot. (To be fair, this sentiment is in keeping with Lewis Carroll's original books.)
Alice is beautifully voiced by Kathryn Beaumont (who did a similarly excellent job as the voice of Wendy in ""Peter Pan"" a few years after.) The real appeal of Alice here is that unlike many other Disney heroines,Kathryn Beaumont was a young girl when she recorded the voice and therefore, Alice looks and sounds like a girl of a certain age.  Contrast that to Mary Costa's voice and the animated figure of Sleeping Beauty who looks as if she could be a 1950s pinup model despite only being 16.
The story itself is a wild trip through an ever shifting dreamscape most notable for the wild color schemes that anticipate the 1960's motifs. This is not implying that ""Alice in Wonderland"" is one big drug reference; it is not. Many people who worked on this film have commented that it felt like the film was getting away from them, that the characters took on lives of their own. This is evident as the film just gets wilder and wilder as it goes on with the introductions of the most bizarre and colorful characters Disney ever brought to life.
The only real flaws in the film include a scene when Alice breaks down and berates herself for never following her own advice, this moment stops the film cold in the middle of what has been a non-stop thrill ride.  The extremely abrupt ending of the film is a very strange choice. I think even an extra 20-30 seconds between Alice and her sister at the conclusion of the film would have made the film a little stronger.
The DVD has some interesting extras, but again, I feel that the Disney studios still do not have a high regard for this film and just threw it together on DVD. I have heard that the LaserDisc version had many more interesting extras, and it would be my hope for this film to get a rerelease on DVD with some more extras restored.",1050019200,15,3257,4.505922165820643

The animation is positivley beautiful, colourful, effective, fast paced and makes for fun and highly entertaining viewing throughout the film. Though lovers of the book by Lewis Carroll may have qualms about the Americanisation of some of the more familiar characters it does actually stand as a fantastically animated offering of the story done in Disneys own inimitable style. Kathryn Beaumont is the voice for a cute version of Alice that bares slight resemblance to the Tenniel origanal. The story is vastly similar to the origanal story with just slight variations although like seemingly every other film version it does draw segments from Lewis Carrolls sequel, Alice Through The Looking Glass. There are such imaganitive, larger-than-life creations here with the Mad Hatter, the bumbling White Rabbit and the hilarious, bellowing Queen Of Hearts. All sequences surprisingly work from the Mad Hatters tea party sequences to the talking flowers sequences to the game of Croquet with the Queen of Hearts. Lots of fun to endure that all kids will just lap up. Masterfully done, I strongly rate and recommend this as one of Disneys true, enthralling masterpieces ranking right up there with some of his more famous work.

As for the Lewis Carroll craziness.....I love Alice. It is as much fun as it was when I was a kid. The story is so charming, amusing, and immaginative.

On another note those who like this movie will certainly love a new Japanese animation called ""Spirited Away"" which has been licsensed by Disney and will hit the theatres supposedly on September 20th.

What I found was a rerelease trailer (note: not the original theatrical trailer!) and an amusing and informative documentary called ""Operation: Wonderland"" from the 1950s featuring Walt Disney himself. I was satisfied with the disc, that is, until I did some researching.
Apparently the Laserdisc version of Alice has many more extras on it. Why Disney opted to not put them on the DVD is beyond me, but I think it really hurt the disc.

Realizing it's farcical makes matters worse, I think, since it's known ahead of time that all the blathering won't amount to anything.
The animation and design of Alice herself is the highlight of the film. Aside from that, there are only a couple of dark, psychedelic moments which barely have enough screen time to be interesting.

The story is fimiliar to most, Alice dreams of a White Rabbit racing against his clock, proclaiming that he's late. Alice's curiosity wins, and she follows, leading to her falling into Wonderland.
""Alice in Wonderland"" finds it's strength by mining Carrol's original tale for rich sequences, that are then transplanted into the film to the full extent of Walt Disney's animator's imagination. The film has it's weakness: story pacing. Unlike other of Walt's creations, this one does not have great transitions to take us through Alice's journey. It's just one thing, followed all of a sudden by another.
The Gold Collection DVD, contains an insightful documentary of Walt Disney taking us through the making of the movie with appearences by the real life actors modeling for the animators.
I also think that instead of Disney continuing to ruin Walt's classics by making contrived, unnecessary video sequels, they should mine Carrol's ""Alice Through The Looking Glass"" to make a justified sequel out of this one.",1004054400,,1128,5.169398907103825

Tweedle Dee and Dum's ""Logic!"" line was just sheer idiocy.. The script writers tried to cram all the poetry into the *songs* (example: As Alice is leaving Dee and Dum, they start singing ""You are old Father William""). The Spanish dub was.. eh,fair. I've heard better dubs,though, and from what I could tell (and this is coming from a 1st year Spanish student) the songs were translated in a rhyming-sing along style instead of directly translating. (Of course,the translator(s) had to make the words fit the music but ""The Unbirthday song"" was overkill..) The Mad Tea Party scene was wrecked and the Hatter,who in the book was a witty person, was changed to a Goofy-esque short man with grey hair. *sigh* I could go on about the idiocy of this adaption,but why bother?

""Alice in Wonderland"" is by far the best animated film to ever come from the Disney studios, and is easily one of the most magical and imaginitive films ever made...period.  I still remember the first time I saw this cinematic gem when I was around 3 years old, and have loved it ever since.
I also now own the Disney CD soundtrack which contains not only all the wonderful songs from the film, but also the entire original, and extremely delightful, instrumental pieces heard throughout the film.  (By the way, any LP version you might happen to find of Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"" soundtrack is simply an imitation with re-recorded versions of the actual songs heard in the movie.

If they had shortened the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, they might have had room to add in some of the other off-the-wall characters. If you know the original story too well, you will find yourself looking for characters which never appear.

So, I think watching this film would be a good way to get kids to find out what else Alice was up to in her fantasy topsy-turvy dream world. For adults who remember the book, this magical animation classic will take you back to your childhood.

301380,4,6300274268,"I am a fan of both Lewis Carroll and Disney, and as such, I can appreciate the merits of both the literary classic, and the animated adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. True, 'Alice' is not your typical Disney fare, and it is weak in being episodic and rather disjointed. Still, the film remains a colorful, tuneful, funny, high-paced, VERY imaginative rendering of Carroll's classic. The studio merged elements from both 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' and some may object to the omission of certain characters. But the film succeeds on many levels, particularly the wonderful voice characterizations! I adore The March Hare and Mad Hatter, the Queen and King of Hearts, The Caterpillar and the talking flowers in particular. Adapting the verbal humor of the book to film was no easy feat, but considering the challenges, the movie holds up very well. I found the new DVD splendid, particularly the extras! Great fun to see the old Black/White films with Walt Disney, Kathryn Beaumont and Edgar Bergen. As for the film itself, the remastered color is amazing and the animation wonderful, particularly in Alice's facial expressions and human characteristics. I think the film is one of the best versions made and far underappreciated!",984096000,9,1268,5.130434782608695

One of the main reasons people buy a DVD formated title is to get good sound, including left and right channels.  I'm sure Disney will repair that some day if they think there is enough money in it.",981763200,3,535,4.29
301403,4,6300274268,"Disney has done a superlative job transferring ""Alice in Wonderland"" to DVD.  The colors are eye-popping, the picture is razor sharp and there is no visible grain at all.  I was blown away by the picture quality.

Now, on to the film.  ""Alice in Wonderland"" has always had problems.  Even Disney himself did not feel it was very good.  He said once that it lacked ""heart.""  I don't know what it lacks, but I do know Disney made a MAJOR mistake in allowing the voice of Alice, Kathryn Beaumont, do her own singing in the film.  The girl had a HORRIBLE singing voice, so horrible that Darlene Gillespie of ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" actually re-recorded Beaumont's vocals for the ""soundtrack"" album.

Another problem is one that is inherited from the book, which is a meandering, episodic storyline, each segment having absolutely nothing to do with the last.  ""Alice in Wonderland"" is really an unfilmable book -- there have been at least half a dozen screen versions made, and none of them have been very good.  And frankly, I doubt if anyone ever WILL make it into a good movie.  It's just not a book that lends itself to being filmed.

Another problem is one that Disney ran into in ""Mr. Toad"":  His characterization of the British is not quite on the mark.  His characters are CARICATURES of the British.  Disney didn't quite seem to understand the whole British sensibility, which is key to Lewis Carrol's humor.  Disney's ""Alice,"" as well as his ""Mr. Toad,"" seem too Americanized, like he didn't quite ""get"" the books on which they were based.
In addition, the character of Alice doesn't seem to have much of a personality, and what personality is there is not very likable.  She's kind of a whiner.
All that said, the Mad Hatter's Tea Party is wonderful and so is ""The March of the Cards,"" which also is my all-time favorite instrumental from a Disney film.  And Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee are PERFECT (their ""That's logic!"" line actually makes me laugh out loud), although I don't particularly care for the Walrus and the Carpenter sequence.  There are also many brilliant pieces of visual invention in the flower garden and forest sequences.
So, for adults anyway, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a mixed bag.  Not one of Disney's best -- but it sure makes a great-looking DVD!",975801600,7,2276,4.725888324873097

A person without imagination is like a history book without pictures.  For an adult version of ""Alice In Wonderland"" see ""Being John Malkovich"".

301409,3,6300274268,"The Lewis Carroll book was always a top contender for the Disney studios.  Yet somehow, when the movie was made, the book must have reined in the artists too much.  They couldn't really indulge their creative fantasies as  much as they could with the other major Disney features of the times, which  were based on very short stories and hence had tons of room for creative  innovation.  So, ALICE IN WONDERLAND became a picture-movie of the  book--delightful and all that, but somehow constrained, restricted.  The  book was meant to be a study in logical irony; obviously a movie couldn't  do that and still make you root for Alice.  But if you take the irony out,  things happen to Alice that don't make much sense, and I suppose that kids  notice this.  They can't really relate to Alice.  Of course, it's still a  very fine movie.  And with the DVD on a good TV or projection unit, you  find what I consider the absolute best employment of cartoons on a totally  black background.  Disney kept the black, I suppose, to remind us that it  was all a dream.  But look at what the black does to the cartoon  characters!  It brings them out, it almost makes them three-dimensional.  The colors become magical because you can focus on them against a solid  background of black.  There is nothing like it in moviedom except the  marvelous ice-skating sequence in SUN VALLEY SERENADE where Sonja Henie  skates on black ice!",964310400,20,1419,4.654471544715447

The movie has never been able to shake this image, and that is a shame. We  should remember that ""Wizard of Oz"" wasn't a giant box office hit  in 1939, and only after it was made an annual event on television did it  become a classic in the eyes of the public. ""Alice in Wonderland""  deserves far more attention than it has ever received. The characters are  wonderful. The music is humable, even singable. It's a short film that  takes the viewer into a dreamland, and Disney's animated version stands up  against any of the other live versions that have popped up over the years.  It's time to give this movie the credit it deserves as a classic in  animation. Watch it from a child's point of view, with the amazing images  of a cat that disappears, talking cards, and Alice constantly growing and  shrinking.
