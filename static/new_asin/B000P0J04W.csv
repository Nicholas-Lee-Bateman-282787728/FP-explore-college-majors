2807046,3,B000P0J04W,then the product finally came after being shipped twice and was not in new conition as promised the back cover was torn off,1188864000,,123,4.391304347826087
2807047,5,B000P0J04W,"These are a must to own. The first two in the Jason Bourne series. Magnificent. Check out the third installment too. Woh, that's even more amazing. Can't wait for the dvd.",1188518400,,171,4.548387096774194
2807048,5,B000P0J04W,"I wanted to purchase the two Bourne movies prior to seeing the third installment in the theaters.  Just in time this multiple disk set was realeased.  It was a nice touch to add the third disk with narrative, however I found it a bit boring.  The biography of the author of the series was interesting though.  All in all it was less expensive than buying the two movies separately and did provide nice value.

You won't be dissapointed if you liked any of the three movies.  They all contain the same level of believable action.",1188086400,16,528,4.505263157894737
2807049,1,B000P0J04W,"Probably an OK movie.

Except that Amazon sub-contracted a third party to provide this movie.  It was poorly packaged and damaged in shipping.

However that probaly would not have mattered because the disk was covered with glue.

Please do not send factory rejects as saleable merchandise.",1187913600,,289,5.217391304347826
2807050,4,B000P0J04W,Everything in this is great. For once I could get a dvd I actually want that has cool packaging (dvds are in files) . Usually I see a dvd on the shelf and has really cool packaging like a complete series dvd and kinda wish I was into that show or movie. But this is great and the bonus disc is a surprise but I wish there could've been a free tix to bourne ultimatum but not important. I think it would've been better if they also released this on blue-ray also .These are also the standard edition discs so no extended cuts. If you don't have it and like these movies get it you won't be disappointed but if your a big fan you might want to get them individualy.,1185235200,19,663,4.068702290076335
2807051,5,B000P0J04W,"Chose this item by a request, as with the rest of the series. Will truly enjoy all the movies, love the suspense.",1388016000,,113,4.181818181818182
2807052,5,B000P0J04W,"Matt Damon thrills as Jason Bourne in the first two movies of the Bourne series.  What is on the third disc you ask?!  Idk, I haven't watched it yet but I think it is special features.",1381708800,,184,4.083333333333333
2807053,5,B000P0J04W,"Have not watched yet, but I feel sure it will be okay.  My husband and I watch the Bourne movies on tv all the time.  These movies are very exciting and filled with action.  Not much bad language and I don't remember any scenes that would not be good for young people.",1376870400,,268,4.115384615384615
2807054,4,B000P0J04W,Thought I was getting all three Bournes but one is just a bonus dvd.  Still worth the money though.  Thanks.,1368748800,,108,4.35

2807059,2,B000P0J04W,"there are 2 dvd in this package, but when we open it, one of the dvd is defected, can't play it, but its
not worth to send it back, so I need to buy another one.",1356393600,,161,3.5
2807060,4,B000P0J04W,This was a really good series. Love how it gets you thinking about how things happen. I stopped at the three. When they changed actors I didn't watch anymore of the series.,1350777600,,172,4.40625
2807061,3,B000P0J04W,"I thought i was careful to read between the lines, but did not check the release date of this collection. The 3 disc collection can be misleading. The 3rd disc is just commentary.",1334880000,,179,4.454545454545454

2807065,1,B000P0J04W,The product was pretty bad. It skipped several times on the DVD. The total viewing time lost is around 30 minutes. Not good.,1190764800,3,124,4.434782608695652
2807066,5,B000P0J04W,"I love the Bourne movies.  The bonus DVD with this set is very informative.  It gives the viewer an inside view of how the movies were made, how some of the stunts were accomplished and a view of some of the locations filming took place.  It also gives inside info on the actors and through interviews allows them to give their opinions on the directors and other actors.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the DVD set.",1190764800,,411,4.44

2807069,5,B000P0J04W,"Very entertaining action-packed movies.  The ""file"" packaging is clever marketing.  We enjoyed the extras provided on disk 3 which included interesting pieces featuring author Robert Ludlum. Looking forward to The Bourne Ultimatum.",1189036800,,231,6.1875
2807070,4,B000P0J04W,Would have given it 5 stars if not for the cheap packaging. They make it look like a top secret document holder but it is just cheap cardboard,1188950400,,142,4.107142857142857
8188009,3,B000P0J04W,"Was a bit disappointed, as advertising sounded like you would get all three movies. I got 2 movies, and, the 3rd disc was on how they made one of them.",1510012800,,151,4.066666666666666
