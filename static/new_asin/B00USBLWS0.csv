7070933,4,B00USBLWS0,"[REC] 4: Apocalypse is the fourth film in a horror franchise that began in 2007 with the found footage film [REC].  There were two previous sequels that weren't very good, but this one hits the horror bulls eye. In this film, the gimmick of found footage is abandoned and the story is told through traditional narrative. Reporter Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco), two firefighters, and a survivor from [REC] 3 are on a quarantine ship in the Atlantic. Doctors are trying to find a cure for the virus that turns human beings into cannibalistic zombies while keeping the infected away from the general population.

The film uses a staple of fright cinema: the horror of claustrophobia. By setting the movie aboard ship, the characters are constrained by their immediate environment which heightens tension as the infected stalk and prey upon the healthy. There is nowhere to run, no hope of rescue, no possibility of escape. Sudden zombie attacks provide gruesome images of torn flesh, profuse blood, and extreme gore, though the attacks themselves aren't that plentiful.

Director Jaime Balaguero maintains a brisk pace as a fight for survival escalates. The final third of the film relies on the device of a race against time to further heighten tension, but it tends to take the movie more into action flick territory than true horror resolution. The R-rated movie is definitely not for the squeamish.

The only bonus extra on the DVD release is a making-of features.",1431907200,,1466,4.995901639344262
7070934,4,B00USBLWS0,"Certainly not as good as Rec 1 and 2 but better than Rec 3 for sure. Our TV reporter ngela is rescued from the building and taken to an oil tanker to be examined. The film starts off in the building where it all began and shows her rescue. Once she's brought on board the tanker, things quickly get out of control when a rabid computer-generated zombie-monkey attacks a crew member transferring the virus into him. This is a pretty solid rollercoaster ride of a film. The acting is good and although it lacks the fear factor (and hand held camera element) of the original, it's still gory fun and entertaining.",1431820800,,610,4.504504504504505

7070937,3,B00USBLWS0,"I guess you can consider it unfortunate or a privilege to watch the fourth Rec film before any of its predecessors. It depends on how you
want to look at it. I gained interest in the series after renting this one from my local Red box, since it was the only one available at this point in time. I already new what I was getting into because it is a foreign(Spain) made film with English subtitles. I've watched many indie foreign films with subtitles and had no problems whatsoever. I find these types of films to be far better than your average Hollywood trite. In fact as of now, I have seen all of the Rec films except the third. Before viewing I did know that this one was filmed without the ""found footage"" style as seen in Rec 1 and 2.

 Now onto my review of Rec 4: Apocalypse. For openers I thought this was a well made film with some CGI but not overused. Most of the CGI used was for the distant exterior shots of the cruise ship itself. Some have said it looked pretty terrible but I didn't find it to detract anything from the film overall. The acting I found to be very believable. I don't know if it was because they were speaking in another language or that they are just good actors/actresses in general. Nonetheless it worked. Manuela Velasco(Angela) returns and she works very well for the lead. The action was there and I found no pacing issues whatsoever.

 Now for the cons. I would have to say after Rec 3, this would have been the perfect opportunity to take the Rec series back to it's roots with the ""found footage/shaky cam"" style. I did not watch Rec 3 yet at this point in time but I have done my research and I know that it was without the same style Rec 1 and 2 had. Plus, it seemed to have more of a comedic quirky tone to it from what I've read and seen. I think that the old video style would have worked well on a cruise ship with it's narrow corridors, dark, and damp areas of the ship. Not to mention the feeling of isolation in general being out on a ship in the middle of nowhere.

 The first two films in the series I find to be the best so far. My instincts tell me that Rec 3 probably won't top them. As for this one, I find it to be a solid movie. Perhaps if it was a stand alone film, I would have gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. For being the 4th Rec in the series and missing the chance to do it in the old rec style, I'd say a 3 out of 5 stars overall.",1430956800,4,2394,4.050739957716702
7070938,4,B00USBLWS0,Good movie didn't care for it being subtitle,1429833600,,44,4.625
7070939,5,B00USBLWS0,Awesome.  Love the series.  A must have for horror fans.,1429833600,2,56,4.5
7070940,4,B00USBLWS0,"I am a horror fiend and a gorehound and a schlockmeister and I stop to gape like a jerk at roadside accidents. So when it comes to horror cinema, I tend to be more forgiving. I grade on a curve. It's partly why I rate this one 3.5 out of 5 stars. That the first two [REC] movies were so good also factors in, earning a whiff of latitude for this fourth entry.

It's not that [REC] 4: Apocalypse entirely does away with the demonic possession angle. The plot just seriously tamps it down. It's cool that the movie picks up on the Angela Vidal thread since she's the core character in the franchise. When we'd last seen her in [REC] 2, TV reporter Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) seemed beyond salvation. [REC] 4 harrumphs at that assumption as its opening sequence details her rescue from that quarantined tenement by a team of Spanish S.W.A.T.s. The venue shifts to an oil tanker sailing along in the ocean where Angela and the surviving S.W.A.T. members are now confined and guarded by a private army, with Angela subjected to laboratory experimentation. And I guess it makes sense to isolate them like this because if a zombie epidemic manifests, then at least they're all stuck in the middle of nowhere. As ever, man's hubris screws the pooch. We're introduced to the oil tanker's captain, and when he divulges that he's about to retire and that this is his final sea voyage, you and I must've shared a knowing smirk.

I'll tell the world that I love the [REC] universe and am pre-disposed to relish any new excursions into it. [REC] 4: Apocalypse gets a pass from me, even though it obeys the law of diminishing returns. That [REC] and [REC] 2 were so good relied hugely on the realism of the setting and a knack for jangling your nerves in a visceral, atavistic way. [REC] 4 gives us a watered-down approach and so isn't as good. It forfeits much of the series' vaunted freshness and its point of distinction and much of its sense of immediacy by shedding the found footage conceit, discounting the infrequent perspective from the ship's security cameras. Also, frankly, the nautical backdrop, as rendered here, simply isn't as creepy or claustrophobic as the abandoned apartment building of the first two films. I've also a bone to pick with the film's addendum title. It's a bit silly to use the word ""Apocalypse"" when the remote setting suggests that a potential outbreak would be even more of a confined thing.

Other than Manuela Velasco - who is fantastic at juxtaposing seeming frailty with measured aggression - I found no one to root for. Not the S.W.A.T. doctor Guzmn (Paco Manzanedo), despite the heroic jaw and cheekbones. Not the resident I.T. expert/radio operator slob, Nick (Ismael Fritschi), who harbors a mad crush on our TV reporter. Not the mercurial Filipino chef with the gross menu. Not the daft old lady (Maria Alfonsa Rosso)who behaves as if she's still in the wedding from [Rec] 3: Genesis. Certainly not the two scientists playing God. The revealed big bad underwhelms with its lack of exhibited malevolence. We're treated to that old b.s. - the parascientific diagnosis. And it's a bummer that no one onboard knew to just recite Bible verses over the ship's intercom like they did in [Rec] 3: Genesis. Still, even jaded gorehounds like you and me can appreciate the flair and execution of the panicky survival horror action taking place on the upper decks but especially deep in the dank bowels of the ship. Even if it seems like we'd seen all this before.",1429401600,5,3488,4.705400981996727

7070942,5,B00USBLWS0,"[REC] 4 Apocalypse was super fun and gory as hell. Manuela Velasco reprises her role as Angela Vidal and executes the character perfectly with this 4th chapter in the REC franchise. She's much more of a primal survivor in this movie. Aggressive and more physical which added a aspect of the character that I felt was missing.

I most definitely felt REC 4 was just as claustrophobic and frightening as the first 2 films. The dark corridors and small confined spaces on the ship were great for the film and building that atmosphere that REC thrives in. Not having the found footage style gave the movie more depth and interesting character dynamics between Angela and the crew on the ship. Not to mention the movie throws out most of the religious mombo jumbo that 2 and 3 emphasized heavily on which as a result made it look and feel much more like a zombie movie. REC 4 also ditches almost everything the 3rd movie had which was really nice. You could easily jump from REC 2 to this.

 I enjoyed revisiting the building in the first part of the movie. It was cool to see the Military pick up where the SWAT team left off and to see them plant all those bombs in such quick fashion trying to get the hell out of there. Its been so long since we entered the building from the first 2 movies that it was awesome to still see all the blood and aftermath of what the Residents and SWAT team had to go through. The soundtrack was beautiful. And the cinematography was great. The CGI was surprisingly well done and you really felt like you were on the ship with these people and not just a set.

Fans of the previous REC movies will absolutely not be disappointed. Sure it wasn't a super proper finish but it sure as hell caps of the series nicely and I was quite satisfied with the film. It rejects the slapstick goofiness of the 3rd REC and goes back to the serious, gritty blood splattered REC movie I so heavily enjoyed in 1 and 2.

Give this one a watch guys!",1427760000,6,1958,4.353424657534247
7070943,1,B00USBLWS0,"I'll start by saying I'm a huge horror fan and overall have been very happy with the new horror movies that have been coming out over the last few years.  Rec 1 was truly scary, creepy and entertaining and Rec 2 was a worthwhile sequel that I also enjoyed.

Almost by rule once you get to the third or fourth in a horror movie franchise the movies start getting worse and worse.  Reviews were so bad on Rec 3 I avoided it but early reviews of Rec 4 seemed promising so I decided to give it a shot and i was truly disappointed.

The first 20-30 minutes of the movie is extremely dull and simply rehashing tired horror movie themes from movies like Resident Evil.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen even when the action hit it was predictable and non original.

The Scariest part of this movie was when they showed footage from Rec 1 on a tv screen.  That's telling you something.  This was an unimaginative and uninspired cash in.",1445904000,,946,4.396551724137931

7070945,1,B00USBLWS0,"Unimaginative - just borrowed (stole?) the same old formula of scientists trying to isolate virus (or other nasty) that infects people turning them into zombies. The true zombies are the ones hooked on this time-worn, now thread bare, setup. Virus turns out to be a surprisingly very accurate rendition of a common worm only bigger and of course is disgustingly swallowed by the host. Of course you've got everyone isolated (only this time it's a ship) and there's a few military types to supply action and weapons. What good is a zombie without lots of firepower to showcase red dyed corn syrup.
Really cheaply made; really poor acting; unbelievable storyline. The best part of the movie, and it's always true with cheap productions, is the DVD cover which almost always will give a false, but sellable, impression.
The unimaginative one or two survive as well as, left in doubt (albeit small doubt), the worm. By the way didn't the writers ever finish middle school and learn that worms die in water (more so in salt water) which is why you see them escaping during rains.

7070947,4,B00USBLWS0,"Never say a series of movies is ending even though they say this is the last one. Some have said that the REC series of films will continue while at the same time I once read that this was it. Only the future will tell. As long as they continue to be as entertaining as the first four Id be happy to see them carry on.

If youve missed the earlier entries in the series then by all means rush out and buy them to add to your collection. While the third was kind of weak the first two offer some of the scariest moments to be found in horror films over the past decade or so. The original film began with a puff piece TV news reporter filming a segment on a local fire department. The crew get called out to help at a local apartment house and find themselves confronted by what they at first think of as a rabies type outbreak. In reality the victims are basically zombies come back to life with an insatiable appetite for the living. The movie ended with the team and the apartment dwellers sealed in the building by the government. By the end of the second film the reporter and who was left were tranquilized and woke to find themselves on an oiler far out to sea.

Bypassing the third installment for the most part, thats where this one picks up. The reporter and the last two firemen who arrived to help are on board the ship as is the last living guest from the wedding party in part 3. Onboard the ship are doctors attempting to discover just what it was that infected everyone as well as a possible cure for the disease.

As the film progresses a sense of paranoia fills every member of both the crew and those who have been brought to this ship. The doctors continue to have a problem trying to discover just what it was that began this infection. In the past films everything from a virus to demonic possession was considered or offered as an explanation. Here though no common thread between those who were brought on board can be found. Not only that but where our heroine once displayed signs of the virus being in her now we find none.

The doctors are later shown to be experimenting with infected monkeys and when one escapes the film turns into something completely different. Now as crew members are infected it becomes a fight for survival. At the same time the question is posed as to just who can be trusted and who cant? Which of these passengers brought on board actually had the infection incubating inside of them and who was just a person in the wrong place at the wrong time?

Still using the point of view of a camera for the most part here, the movie still offers some decent scares from start to finish. It also gives us an explanation that tells us why this has been happening before the film ends, one that also offers the possibility of more movies. Never leave a franchise with a closed ending folks.

The suspense in the film might not equal that of the first movie but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat here. The horror aspects are on display as well in full force. On top of that the film is well made, well written and well-acted. While watching it I found myself wanting to pull out the previous three films and start a home movie marathon of my own to watch them in order once again.

I know that this is one Ill be adding to the shelf right next to the previous three. They will all be played again at one time or another. Perhaps when I find myself in need of a good scare. Or perhaps when a niece or nephew stays over and I want to provide nightmares for them that their parents will have to deal with. In any event, these movie offer the goods when it comes to new horror. Fans will want to make them part of their collection.",1436313600,,3680,4.263610315186247
7070948,2,B00USBLWS0,"[REC] 4: Apocalipsis is the fourth and final instalment of the hit series that started back in 2007. Manuela Velasco, who played in the original ngela Vidal, a hapless TV reporter trapped in a Barcelona building, is back here, playing the same role again. This time ngela finds herself confined in an isolated place that is controlled by a military/medical team.

This is a pretty conventional zombie infestation-themed movie and as such it may entertain some of the viewers. But most people would think that it is pointless to produce another entry when it no longer has the originality characterized the first [REC] movie.

In fact, as a stand-alone film [REC] 4: Apocalipsis is not very good, with a storyline that is too weak and contrived, and expository dialogue about the origin of the disease that is getting more and more preposterous. And more important, the film itself is neither scary nor interesting in any way.",1435881600,3,925,4.923076923076923

Moving the action from the apartment building, scene of the other films, to a ship, maintained the claustrophobic feeling.  The setting is more brightly lit, but the sense of danger is maintained by the multitudes of nooks and crannies from which a threat may present itself.

Angela (Manuela Velasco), the reporter from the first two films, is exhibiting no signs of infection or possession as the movie begins, and yet soon a new and bloody outbreak is occuring onboard the vessel.  Like [REC] 3, it uses the found footage angle only sporadically (ex. characters trying to fix the camera from the first two movies and uncover what it recorded; characters using onboard surveillance cameras to keep track of things), going most of the time more as a traditional style movie.  Unlike [REC] 3, the quirkiness and darkly comedic elements are mostly gone and the film has the same general tone as the first two movies, only even gorier and more action-packed.  Survivors band together to try and stay alive against the growing ranks of the infected, while for the intelligence behind this and previous outbreaks, getting off the ocean and back on land to begin spreading in greater numbers is the goal.  Intense, scary, well-made and well acted, [REC] 4: Apocalypse is a highly worthy addition to the series.",1462838400,,1205,4.887254901960785
8708116,3,B00USBLWS0,"John's Horror Corner: REC 4: Apocalypse (2014), a shipwrecked disappointment for this Spanish zombie franchise.
Spanish TV reporter ngela Vidal (Manuela Velasco; REC) is rescued [picking up from the end of the second REC film] and sequestered for precautionary testing aboard a mobile laboratory on an ocean vessel.  Finding herself in restraints, she doesn't exactly feel ""rescued"" or safe, nor does she trust her new host.

This fourth franchise installment frees us from our most effectively isolated landlocked apartment building zombie siege and infected flesh-eating wedding to quarantine us on a ship.  With no rescue boats and disabled radio communication, it seems that our militarized team of scientists have not only succeeded at finally isolating the virus behind the zombie epidemic, but also at sealing their own fate should operations go less than smoothly.

We have plenty of time to get to know our characters but I think we barely sufficiently give a damn about most of them, not nearly as much as with REC 1-3.  Parts 1-3 not only laid solid foundation for personable characters, but did so while the urgency level slowly ebbed from completely innocuous happy environments to utter dire terror.  Here in part 4 we are dropped into troubled waters immediately and neither we nor our main characters have their guard down for even a momentnot even for a 20-minute introduction during which we'd like for someone to think there was hope.  As such, there is no hope that we'll care what happens to these people and subsequently no hope that we the audience will feel the threat of ""Apocalypse"" as the title suggests.

Rather than being well-intentioned, altruistic or optimistic, our scientist-commander is viciously pragmatic and his coldness borders on villainy.  This operation is tyrannical by his design and, spoiler alert, all his security provisions will fail.  Cue the evil zombie monkeys!!!  You heard me: zombie monkeys.  Zombie animals alone don't harm the legitimacy of a horror movie, but the way they are handled here does.  They start out cool, then they go overboard.

Shipmates get infected, the gore and zombie effects are pretty good, and the action is high-paced.  I'm entertained.  The only problem is that I don't really care.  I'm far less invested in the characters and even though this is not a found footage film, the camera relentlessly shakes during zombie attack scenes (as if the Starship Enterprise got hit by a Klingon photon canon--you know that shake).  But the camera is admittedly less shaky than the preposterous story of a ship laboratory that willingly sets its course into a dangerous stormand they never explain why.  This sequel bit off more than it could chew, feels way less credible than parts 1-3, and fell off the deep end into ScyFy channel movie-of-the-week quality.

The most interesting thing about the story is perhaps the very thing most people will find annoying.  In REC 3: Genesis (2012), we were introduced to the notion that this zombie virus had a Biblical origin: demons!  This movie builds on that idea and may or may not have borrowed some flavor from The Hidden (1987) and Guillermo del Toro's parasitic worm zombies in The Strain.  This development takes things in a zany direction that provides a solid disservice to its three predecessors.

This movie isn't really bad as a random horror flick.  It's certainly well-acted, has decent special effects and production value, and it made for a breezy entertaining 90 minutes.  So I'll give this a weak to moderate recommendation.  Fans of the franchise should see it (although I think it offers the least of the four films and will likely disappoint to some extent), zombie fans maybe, and general horror fans could skip it.

To writer/director Jaume Balaguer (Darkness, REC, REC 2), I must ask: ""What happened?""  The claustrophobia of the first two films is rendered limp on this ship (more a writing/direction flaw than the setting itself), the spirit of fun embraced in part 3 (which most people disliked for its deliberate drop in intensity) is also missing, and I wasn't rooting for anyone for the first time in the franchise.
