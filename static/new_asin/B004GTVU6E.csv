4374140,5,B004GTVU6E,I had no idea that I would also enjoy this DVD along with my granddaughter. The writing is really terrific.,1354579200,,107,4.4
4374141,5,B004GTVU6E,Her 8 year big sister watched these at her new sisters age and said she MUST have the complete set!,1354579200,,99,4.0
4374142,5,B004GTVU6E,"I think the wonder pets and backyardigans are fun and educational for children and everyone. I hope they would make more new video,s for wonder pets. I wish they would bring them both back on tv. I would order more wonder pets DVD,s if they made more new one,s. I will order more backyardigans DVD,s later on. I can,t understand why they took them off the air. thats sad. If they have any more new episodes on wonder pets let me know I will order them.",1346112000,,452,4.267441860465116
4374143,1,B004GTVU6E,"Clearly, there is only 1 new episode on this dvd.  All the others have been previously released.  The proof is here:
[...]
How ridiculous!  How insulting to those of us who have purchased all the previous dvd'd.",1308960000,,211,4.648648648648648
4374144,5,B004GTVU6E,"My 2 yr old absolutely loves Backyardigans, but one day he has walking around the house swinging his arm and saying ""Arrrrrr"".  I couldn't resist this purchase, my son absolutely LOVES it and so do I.",1301875200,,200,4.555555555555555
4374145,5,B004GTVU6E,"I like this DVD.

It has one episode in each of the four seasons.

Season 1: ""Pirate Treasure""
Season 2: ""Sinbad Sails Alone""
Season 3: ""Pirate Camp""
Season 4: ""The Tale Of The Not-So-Nice Dragon""

""The Tale Of The Not-So-Nice Dragon"" is the only new episode on the disc.",1299715200,32,271,4.489795918367347
4374146,1,B004GTVU6E,i had this in my cart to order then noticed the star rating to see what was up with this - it's a new backyardigan's DVD with not a single new episode on it.  Skip buying this one if you're a backyardigan's fan an have the oher discs.,1299283200,3,234,3.875
4374147,3,B004GTVU6E,"Just to clear up a bit of confusion about The Tale of the Not So Nice Dragon:

""In this sequel to Tale of the Mighty Knights, Tasha the Flighty Fairy and Austin the Grabbing Goblin are off to a tea party at King Pablo's castle, along with his knights Tyrone and Uniqua. Unfortunately, the castle is attacked by a mean-spirited red dragon and Pablo and his knights are captured by the dragon when they try to tame it by grabbing the dragon's tail and counting to ten. Now it's up to Tasha and Austin to rescue them from the dragon's cave, with the help of Dragon. Can they free the king and his knights, and maybe make the not-so-nice dragon nice, too?""

I'm still disappointed that there will only be one new episode on this DVD but am looking forward to the sequel as Tale of the Mighty Knights is a huge favorite in our household.",1296691200,19,832,4.326923076923077
4374148,1,B004GTVU6E,"The previous reviewer is correct - all of the episodes mentioned have been released previously on DVD. We have every Backyardigans DVD, so I can state this definitively. I'm not so kind as the previous reviewer to give it 3 stars though. And I also take issue with the ""not-so-nice dragon"" characterization. ""Mighty Knights"" is one of my daughter's favorites, and the dragon is not scary at all.",1296518400,4,395,4.823529411764706
4374149,3,B004GTVU6E,"How disappointing that there appear to be no new episodes on this video.  From the short manufacturer's summary, it appears that the titles on this disc were previously made available on other discs.  It's got ""Sinbad Sails Alone,"" ""Pirate Camp,"" and ""Tale of the Mighty Knights"" (mis-characterized in the summary as including a ""not-so-nice dragon,"" but rest assured, the dragon is nice).  I guess this would be a fun gift for a toddler who likes pirates and doesn't already have the original discs, but too bad it's not a collection of new stories for the legions of ardent Backyardigans fans (both child and adult) out there.",1295481600,14,628,4.90566037735849

4374177,5,B004GTVU6E,My children love this DVD in addition to the other Backyardigans DVDs we own. The fact that it contains an episode we'd never seen anywhere else is the icing on the cake. I recommend Backyardigans to anyone who wants to expose their youngsters to different styles of cultural music and dance while stimulating their imaginations.,1388620800,4,329,5.0

Finding something for our 4 year old to watch that doesn't bug everyone else within earshot is harder than you'd think. If you haven't tried these, you should. I like how the episodes have a musical style, and the incredible variety of those styles.",1470960000,3,363,4.515151515151516
