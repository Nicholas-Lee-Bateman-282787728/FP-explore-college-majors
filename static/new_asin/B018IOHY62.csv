8742442,5,B018IOHY62,A must see for people that want to know history and do not want it repeated again. Shows how easily someone can fall in line or believe in such hate and propaganda and prejudices.,1501113600,2,179,4.294117647058823
8742443,3,B018IOHY62,"It is interesting to see how Hollywood handled murders committed by the Nazis during World War II in this film made in 1943, in the middle of the war, at a time when six million Jews were being murdered, but there is no mention of it, not even a hint in this film. Much of it is a fictionalized account of the destruction of the village of Lidice in Czechoslovakia and what prompted the Germans to destroy the city and kill its inhabitant. In the film, it is 1942. The Allies parachute a Czech resistance fighter into the area. He reunites with his girlfriend and many of the villagers who knew him from before the war. The Nazis are under the command of Reinhardt Heydrich and the film dramatizes his assassination, an event that led to the destruction of the village and the murder of its people.",1498089600,3,798,4.4353741496598635

8742446,4,B018IOHY62,"I was happy to see this DVD was being released through the Warner Archive collection. Sure, some of these titles are overpriced, and often unrestored, but the ability to see these obscure titles outweighs the negatives, in my opinion.  This is one of three movies I own which portrays the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, (the madman of the title), the other two being ""Operation Daybreak"" and Fritz Lang's ""Hangmen Also Die!"".  This film, directed by Douglas Sirk, has the lowest budget, and is probably the least historically accurate of the three. Nevertheless I enjoyed seeing what Sirk could do with his limited budget, and despite the film's limitations, was moved to tears by the brutality of the Nazi's in response to the attack on Heydrich. The picture and sound quality of the DVD were better than expected.",1452643200,23,820,4.978102189781022
