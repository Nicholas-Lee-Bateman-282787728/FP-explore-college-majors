1948498,5,B0000V8I44,"wow, what a work-out. She does a lot of Anna and Ravi routines, but a little more intense. The fire breath are intense and she holds her poses a little bit longer. I was sweating my butt off. I recomend this vide, and I also do Anna and Ravi dvd's. They are awesome too!!!!",1195689600,4,273,4.074074074074074
1948499,4,B0000V8I44,"First, the bad:

You have to know what Kundalini yoga is.  I had read a book about it, and someone taught me a few of the basics, like the breath of fire.  Even still, there was an exercise or two that had me going, ""You have got to be kidding"", not because of the level of difficulty, but because it seemed really over the top and/or embarassing.

Although my opinion is not intended as medical advice, I studied movement for ten years and taught it professionally and rehabilitatively for five, so I would say that this isn't for anyone with a degenerative spinal condition because of the rotation and rolling on the spine;  also, it' s high impact, so no dicey knees;  finally, you should have prior experience in down dog and how to protect your shoulders if you are rolling through the basic yoga sun salutation series.  Otherwise, this is not the workout for you.

The good:

The scenery is so beautiful.  The music sounds like Loreena Mckennit, if she did Kundalini yoga--it makes the workout fly.  The DVD as a whole isn't boring or annoying, and it's challenging;  I can see doing this on a regular basis.  Last, I think I finally get why people lose weight doing Kundalini:  the sequencing of the workout is in aerobic intervals, but it's not impossible to do if, like me, you are clumsy, inflexible, and slightly overweight.",1178150400,10,1335,4.601694915254237
1948500,5,B0000V8I44,"I loved it. I was a bit sceptical about the whole kundlaini yoga experience as Ana Brett left me somewhat lukewarm and Gurmukh downright perplexed me. It's not that I have anything bad to say about their videos, it just didn't ""click"". It did this time and I had a wonderful, energizing, beautiful workout looking at gorgeous scenery and listening to the most amazing music. I am a fan of Erin now and will look for other DVDs she may put out. Ah, I am buying all her musical CDs too!",1176940800,7,484,4.329670329670329
1948501,3,B0000V8I44,"Yoga is traditionally used to prepare the body for kundalini awakening, and it's only one way to do it.  It seems to me that the term kundalini is now being used to refer to merely another workout style, and people have no idea what it really is.  I have no problem with using yoga asanas merely for getting fit, since I myself am preparing for kundalini awakening by a different
method, under the instruction of a real guru. I myself am using yoga asanas merely as a way of getting fit. However, I feel that another term should be used for what this is, not kundalini yoga. Mantra girl is not a guru, and only real enlightened teachers should be messing around with teching people how to awaken kundalini.  This the kind of thing that results in people having kundalini awakenings that go bad, or a lot of fluffiness at the very least. This waters down the meaning of what kundalini really is to the point of total cluelessness - like totally dude! If you want to actually find out about kundalini, one of the best ways to start would be to read ""Energies of Transformation: A Guide to the Kundalini Process"" by Bonnie Greenwell. Then find a real teacher, somebody actually enlightened.  If you just want to get fit, avoid Kundalini!  Do some power yoga or iron yoga or something like that. These quick fix workout stars, especially ones who gives themselves names like ""mantra girl,""  do more harm than good to the general understanding of kundalini.",1158105600,26,1452,4.608527131782946
1948502,5,B0000V8I44,"This workout is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I have been using it everyday since I purchased it and have left my other DVD's on the shelf. Mantra Girl is uplifting, fit and motivating. The workout is hard but doable for anyone. The music is great and the setting is perfect. Hope to see more from Mantra Girl in the future.",1152835200,10,332,4.370967741935484
1948503,5,B0000V8I44,"If you want the zenith of detoxifying, aerobic activity matched with a true test of strength, will power, and endurance, this is the DVD for you.  First, understand that Mantra Girl is giving you the exact, original Warrior Workout handed down to us from Yogi Bhajan, who obviously received this from his yogi.  I originally discovered this sequence in Ravi Singh's book, ""Kundalini Yoga For Body, Mind and Beyond,"" published in 1988.  As hard as this challenging sequence is, Erin actually reduces the time of running in place from five to roughly three minutes and reduces the amount of frog and piston poses from 108 reps to roughly 70+ reps.  Despite these slight adjustments, this is virtually the truest representation of how this amazing test of strength and will is actually performed.  For example, there are no breaks, no intermittant meditations between each exercise.  This set is for pure detoxification and designed to target the heart chakra like nothing else.  Yes, there are precautions necessary to safely accomplish the highest degree of dynamic tension between the mind and body.  You must purchase a sheep skin rug.  Do not try running in place or hopping up and down without using your hands unless you have the cushioned support this essential piece of yoga equipment affords you.  This is not, I repeat, not a mat workout.  This is perhaps why Ravi Singh and Ana Brett replaced the bombastic running with marching to facilitate more widespread, perhaps more do-able, use of this diamond of all kriyas.  Whatever the reason, this version is the original version and it is obvious that it is perhaps the only workout I have ever done which borderlines on being scary.  It is essential that you are well rested and absolutely calm before undertaking this trial.  Just like extremely hard single leg standing poses in ashtanga, this entire kriya requires complete concentration so the supposed limitations of the body can be overcome.  People who think this isn't yoga fail to understand that the number one principle of yoga isn't its form, but one's ability to maintain a meditative focal point no matter how hard a physical sequence appears.  Having said all this, I will now proceed to review Erin Kamler's actual DVD.  The number one aspect of this DVD is that it is made of a continous sequence of action, not assembled in post production.  Therefore, one can marvel at how Erin and her friends actuallly move through this body/mind challenge in real space and time.  The music used is fantastic, driving me on to push through each exercise no matter how hard it is.  The only thing she says that I question or I think has been modified for American audiences is that this is for the ""spiritual warrior.""  I am under the impression this type of workout, like a marine drill, was actually done before Sikh warriors went into battle.  Besides that, Erin is a simple, no-nonsense instructor who gives encouragement and adds incredible life to the task at hand.  I love the Adi Shakti chant at the end and when I am done, I feel like I have performed on a stage for two hours.  This workout produces a sensation of internal invincibility no other workout, not weight training, not even the ashtanga primary series touches.  Again, realize I do not do this workout all the time.  It is something to build up to and I do think that Ravi Singh's and Ana Brett's Warrior Workout is definately a great maintenence DVD by comparison.  However, for those who enjoy a real challenge, who want to plant the flag on Mount Everest, this original version is the king of kundalini kriyas.",1144886400,59,3597,4.815960912052117
1948504,5,B0000V8I44,"This second Mantra Girl DVD follows much the same format as the ""Introduction"" one.

Once again, beautifully photographed, and with a soundtrack that is so enchanting that you could listen to it on its own.

The whole program has obviously been carefully thought out, and the exercises flow splendidly.

As with the ""Introduction"" DVD, it is important to recognize that this is powerful stuff, not just physically, but psychologically and energetically. So it is really important to have a discussion with your health care provider before embarking upon the program.",1139788800,7,566,5.266666666666667
1948505,5,B0000V8I44,"Mantra Girl is the new voice of health and well being.  Her music calms me and de-stresses my being. Her stunning DVD's are hipnotizing and conprehensive.  Easy to follow and modify to my own level of YOGA.
Mantra Girl is a star shinning so bright, you might want to wear sunglasses while doing YOGA with her!!!
She is the image of YOGA!",1073260800,10,337,4.419354838709677
8003468,5,B0000V8I44,"For fellow devotees of the large catalogue of Ravi/Ana DVDs, this is basically the same core set as their Warrior Workout DVD, but a lot of people might prefer this presentation and some little differences. The Warrior Set is rather in(famous) in Kundalini circles, and during teacher training we were called upon to do many of the exercises for 108 reps, as it was taught originally. I could barely walk down the steps to my car after 108 frogs, etc, but we did it and I totally understand why home DVDs never replicate that number of reps. Our teacher for this was Krishna Kaur, an extraordinary woman who described doing this set during morning sadhana (which begins at 4:30am, mind you) for something like 1,000 days. I about fell over just thinking about that.

Here, we have a MUCH more approachable version of this incredible set, designed to work on the circulatory system, nerves and overall strength while working up a good sweat and still being very introspective and meditative. It is filmed outside, in Malibu, and demonstrated by Erin Kamler (aka Mantra Girl) and 4 other women, who demonstrate modified versions of various postures as well. The music is Erin's gorgeous mantra CD, which I still love to listen to in and of itself. You can check it out online somewhere to see what it sounds like but it's a really great contemporary but still ambient take on traditional Kundalini mantras.

Tune Out by chanting Sat Nam once (a long Sat and a brief Nam)

The setting, music and Erin's willingness to allow silence during the postures makes this a surprisingly relaxing set despite being as challenging as you want to make it, and quite vigorous.

I have been enjoying her two DVDs for a very long time, since they were released, and love her mantra CD as well so as someone with a collection of about 40 Kundalini DVDs I highly recommend this, and her Introduction to Kundalini Yoga set as well. That's a lovely set for lower energy days or just for a change of pace.

I personally love this one so much, I would recommend it to a beginner as well, because I like having something to grow into and there are ways to modify just about everything, which are demonstrated. If you are someone who finds that frustrating, the Intro DVD would be a great place to start.",1511049600,,4353,4.763612217795485

8003474,5,B0000V8I44,"This is a more advanced version of the Warrior Workout by Ravi and Anna and I prefer this one since it seems more compact.  This is one of the Kundalini Yoga workouts I turn to when I am trying to lose or maintain my weight since it is cardio enough to qualify for ""exercise"" so I do not feel I have to do a workout dvd or run in order to get my work out in too besides just my yoga.  Music is wonderful as always.  This is a famous Yogi Bhajan set so it seems to flow a little more than some of the kundalini dvd sets that seem to be several kryia tacked together.  This is not for the faint of heart and you might want to start with Ravi's version first and work up to this one since Erin does the exercises for longer periods of time.",1346803200,4,737,3.8933333333333335

8003476,5,B0000V8I44,"This is an excellent workout!! It is harder than Raviana's warrior workout due to less rest periods between poses and the music is beautiful!(I bought the music for my ipod)Total workout time with mantra and meditation is hour and ten minutes approx.  This dvd is not for beginners.  I really like Mantra Girl's other dvd for beginners, also.  I hope she makes more kundalini yoga dvds.

I hope this helps in your decision.

8003477,5,B0000V8I44,"My first introduction to Kundalini yoga was Ravi Singh/Ana Brett.  This DVD was a refreshing change from their style.  I am pretty familiar with the Kundalini yoga moves and didn't find this workout to be super intense, like some of the other reviewers thought.

Erin has a nice, soothing voice.  The backdrop of Malibu Cypress Gardens was nice to look at too.  Two of the exercises in the back showed modifications.

I liked the fast pace of this routine.  I feel very energized after finishing.

Erin uses different terms for some of the exercises and this confused me at first.  She calls ""down dog"" by ""triangle.""

It also would have been nice to have more explanation and words on the screen for the ""adi shakti"" meditation.  I used to just say what I thought were the words.  It wasn't until I did research to find out the actual words used for this meditation, that I really got into it.

A nice, quick paced Kundalini yoga practice for those who are already familiar with Kundalini yoga moves.",1277769600,2,1001,4.619318181818182
