3751637,5,B001PO556E,"Kelly's Hereos was a great tongue-in-cheek movie of the realities of war primarily couched in comedy with a slight profit motive for the survivors.  The mind games in ""Where Eagles Dare"" were outstanding; great script. The Dirty Dozen has always been one of my favorite movies where a motley group of losers get one shot at redemption. Battleground captured the dynamics of men on the front lines with no holds barred. Of the four movies, it has the distinction of being truly believable. Very highly recommend the purchase of this DVD collection offered by Amazon.",1257292800,,565,4.947368421052632
3751638,5,B001PO556E,"At least three of these 4 films are so well known that anyone who is likely to buy this collection is likely to have already seen them, and probably to have memorized choice quotes. (""Drinking wine. Eating cheese. Catchin' some rays . . . you know!"") They've been on heavy rotation as weekend TV-movie filler for decades. But seeing them unaltered and one the widescreen is worth the low price of this set.

The film transfers are uniformly good quality. The extras - mostly ""making of . . ."" shorts - are OK but not great. In short, this set is exactly what it claims to be, and it's fine that way. Any WWII or WWII-movie buff ought to have these films in their collection - they are, if not exactly models of historical accuracy, certainly key touchstones of the genre. You can't have any credibility on the subject without an intimate familiarity with ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", and ""Kelly's Heroes""; ""Battleground"" is not as well known, but is regarded as an excellent movie of its type, and much more realistic than the other three.

All in all, this is a good set of good movies at a good price. What more do you want?

OK - for the few who actually haven't seen the films, here's a capsule summary:

""The Dirty Dozen"": a renegade Army major is tasked with a suicide mission against a Nazi officers' retreat; he recruits misfits from an Army prison, all sentenced to death or long terms, and offers them the possibility of freedom if they will serve on this mission - but first he has to whip the worst soldiers in the Army into a team of top commandos, then they have to actually execute the mission against insane odds. Naturally, the Dirty Dozen rise to the occasion, but not without paying a price. It's kind of a goofy, high-spirits combat film, but it's notable for helping to create the cliche's that defined the genre thereafter: the ""rag-tag band of misfits"" who come together when the chips are down; the white racist who grudgingly comes to accept his black comrade; the salad-bowl assortment of token minorities (one black, one Hispanic, one Jew . . .) who earn respect by fighting for it; the selfless sacrifice by one man for his buddies; the hero who gets cut down by gunfire just steps from safety . . . . Also notable for memorable performances by Lee Marvin as the major; football star-turned actor Jim Brown as the doomed token black guy; lounge singer Trini Lopez, as, incomprehensibly, a singing death-row Hispanic commando (???); Charles Bronson as the quiet tough guy; and Telly Savalas as the psychotic killer who can't hold it together. Good supporting performances by Ernest Borgnine, actor/director John Cassavetes, and a young Donald Sutherland.

""Kelly's Heroes"": a goofy WWII comedy from 1970 that, reading between the lines, can be seen as embodying more than a little of the anti-war counter-culture of that era; easily the strangest ""war movie"" set in WWII, arguably not actually a war movie. The plot has renegade busted-Lieutenant-now-Private Kelly (Clint Eastwood) discovering a deposit of Nazi gold bars being held in a small-town bank vault behind German lines. He talks his platoon into staging an unauthorized mission, without knowledge of their officers, during a three-day layover period - they will infiltrate the German sector, find the bank, steal the gold, and be back before anyone notices. Naturally, things go awry. Good comedy work from Don Rickles as the supply-sergeant fixer who pulls the strings for them - for a price, Carrol O'Connor as the raving general who mistakes their bank job for a real assault and races to pin medals on them while they're still unloading the gold, and Gavin MacLeod (future captain of the ""Love Boat"") in a small role. Telly Savalas is back again as the tough sergeant who reluctantly goes along to try to keep his men from getting killed. Donald Sutherland shines in a supporting role as a laid-back beatnik tank driver who provides their heavy armor - when he's not too stoned to keep awake. The movie is genuinely funny, but there are realistic scenes of intense combat, as well, that keep reminding you that war is no joke - good people die, and often for a lot less reason than a bar of gold.

""Where Eagles Dare"": one of the best-known and well-liked ""serious"" war movies about WWII, it is in many ways as over-the-top as the two previous films. Staged as a war movie, it's actually an action/espionage caper; the script was written by mystery-thriller author Len Deighton from his own novel, and could easily have been a James Bond film, other than for all the Nazi uniforms in evidence. The plot has it that a top British officer was captured and is being held in an impregnable German castle high on a mountaintop - reachable only by a suspended tram. A team of British commandos, with one tag-along American (Clint Eastwood, again), has to infiltrate the schloss in disguise. (""Fortunately, you all speak fluent German!"" Yeah, that was lucky.) But things are not as they seem. The mission quickly begins to unravel, and it gradually unfolds that almost nobody from the Allied side is really who they claim to be. Richard Burton, the team leader (""He's the best man we've got!""), has to figure out who's really on his side, break up a German spy ring that has infiltrated British high command, and get the survivors out of the castle. There is little combat, but the overall tension is high and there are some spectacular scenes of sneaking in and out of the castle on the aerial tram. Good spy movie disguised as a war movie - totally unrealistic as either, but who cares?

""Battleground"": really the only ""real"" war movie in the set, it is a realistic and gritty dramatization of the 101st Airborne in the Battle of the Bulge. It illustrates the constant danger and uncertainty of the combat zone: infiltrators and psychological warfare from the Germans; fog and clouds that prevent re-supply; and the ever-present fear. Stars B-list perennials Van Johnson, Ricardo Montalban, and George Murphy.",1247270400,20,6008,4.776708373435996
3751639,5,B001PO556E,"A great deal like this cannot be passed up.  You have  4 classics that have great actors with superb performances. If you enjoy films from the 70's(except battleground), you will not be disappointed. A real testosterone fest!",1245888000,3,225,5.054054054054054
3751640,5,B001PO556E,"Warner's TCM GREATEST CLASSIC FILMS COLLECTION is a series of over two dozen twin packs. The four titles in each set are dubbed one per side on two flip discs. Except for promo trailers there's no bonus features, but what you --do-- get are quality transfers of well-preserved ever-popular films, at one low price.

My personal fave in ""Battlefront Europe"" is KELLY'S HEROES. Saw it twice in a row one Sunday afternoon in 1970 and the next day purchased a 45 of the title song, ""Burning Bridges"" by the Mike Curb Congregation (MGM).

SYNOPSES--

BATTLEGROUND
Elements of this picture are evident in the ""Bastogne"" episode of HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BAND-OF-BROTHERS/dp/B00006CXSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BAND OF BROTHERS</a>&nbsp;(2001). Both that mini-series chapter and ""Battleground"" are about men of the 101st Airborne and their wintry ordeal during the ""Bulge."" Surrounded, outnumbered, with little food, warm clothes or ammo and under near-constant artillery barrage, about all that can be done is to hunker down and pray. Director William Wellman created here one of the most realistic of all war films.

THE DIRTY DOZEN
The best known in this set is also the most ""Hollywood"" of them all. Robert Aldrich directed an all-star cast in Nunnally Johnson's screenplay about an Army major who trains 12 hardened criminals for a suicide mission behind German lines. Their targets are enemy staff officers taking R&R at a well-guarded chateau.

KELLY'S HEROES
This grim WWII comedy was almost Donald Sutherland's undoing, for he nearly died from hepatitis during the Yugoslavian shoot. After-effects of his illness are visible in final scenes, where Sutherland looks haggard, thin and has red circles under his eyes. The movie itself is about a small group of American soldiers who go behind enemy lines to steal millions in gold ingots.

WHERE EAGLES DARE
Clint Eastwood's first war picture includes scenes of Alp scaling. A group of seven commandos is dropped behind enemy lines. Their mission: to rescue an American general who's being held and interrogated by the SS in a Bavarian mountaintop fortress.

3751816,5,B001PO556E,"WHERE EAGLES DARE is a rousing WWII from Alistair MacLean who wrote his novel and screenplay simultaneously. There is a lot of daring-do as a special team of allied commando specialists attempt to infiltrate the Schloss Adler, a mountain fortress, high in the alps of southern Bavaria. This film is hallmarked my incredible suspense, incredible action and an incredible plot line that scrumptiously wraps and unwraps the viewer attention into a spellbinding frenzy. Richard Burton as Major Smith is the epitome of stoicism as ever dispensing eloquently laced witticisms in bravura of histrionic bliss. Ron Goodwins rousing theme is breathtaking and a real driving force behind this film. WHERE EAGLES DARE is something the stuff legends are made of. Even the cast of  Clint Eastwood, Patrick Wymark, Michael Hordern, Mary Ure, is something to behold. Brian G. Hutton directed this film with incredible energy and excitement.
Such rousing sentiment endears the THE DIRTY DOZEN to so many of us. It has come and gone many years ago, but the legacy of that Dirty Dozen and the lives they touched lives on. Major Reisman, Wladislaw, Franko, Posey, Maggott... they live on. This film is timeles. This was a ground breaking film. This is an endearing film. The sounds of screeching steel along dirt roads and snow covered terrain and the distant sound of the daring heroics smashing their way to freedom, victory and more have long been silent, but the legends of these extraordinary and endearing films lingers on in our memory and give us hope that evil shall always be vanquished with a bit of tongue in cheek along the way. They just don't make them like this any more. The scripting, the rousing and memorable moving scores, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche and the best part of our youth. I often have fleeting thoughts of these films, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from these WWII legends. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. Major Reisman, Wladislaw, Franko, Posey, Maggott, Jiminez, Jefferson, Pinkley...
KELLY'S HEROES is more than just a WWII heist film. I believe its theme is anti war. There are a lot of smiles, goofiness and laughs throughout, but the film never losses sight that this is still a war film and it plays out in a background of stark realism. There are some very somber and reflective moments in the film. Its all about $16,000,000 in gold bars that the Nazis have and Kelly forms a team to steal before the Nazis can move it. It is interesting how Brian G. Hutton directed both KELLY'S HEROES and WHERE EAGLES DARE and essentially that is really those two films are his two greatest and almost only achievements in the cinema. The performances and the characters they portrayed of Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Gavin MacLeod, Carroll O'Connor, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Davalos, and Perry Lopez have essentially been immortalized by this film.
BATTLEGROUND. This gritty World War II film takes the ordinary infantryman and focuses on his daily life and how he perseveres. It is set during the Battle of the Bulge. Van Johnson, John Hodiak, James Whitmore, Ricardo Montalban, George Murphy and Richard Jaeckel are very convincing. You get to see the horrors of war and the depth of camaraderie on their faces in a very personal way. This film pays homage to the ordinary guy, the guy that had to leave family and friends and went out and to defend that which is so dear to us.",1381795200,,3829,4.945652173913044
3751817,2,B001PO556E,"This is a pretty good set of war movies.

-I have always loved Dirty Dozen, everyone should see it.
-I appreciate Kelly's Heroes now more than I did when it came out; 28 years in the military gives one more perspective. Catchy theme song too.
-Battleground I saw decades ago as well and liked watching it.
-Where Eagles Dare is a typical Alistair MacLean book and the movie is at par for the genre as well: a MegaBadass overcomes the enemy at every step while dazzling his accomplices with his brilliance and foresight. I think I believe that pretty much all of the movies could have been better.

But the DvDs won't play in my laptop; I had to dig my old DvD player out and hook it up to the TV. PITA. Typical greedy Hollywood attitude: we got their money - not our problem if they cant watch it; the important thing is they cant copy it and have to buy it again when technology moves on.",1379721600,,889,4.285714285714286

3751848,5,B001PO556E,"This was a great DVD WWII European Theater DVD collection. All 4 movies had no problem running. Great video and sound.

Clint Eastwood stars as Kelly a busted down ex Lieutenant, Terry Savalas as a tuff Master Sergent, Don Rickles as a supply Staff Sergent/ machine gunner, Donald Sutherland as a wacko tank Sergent in charge of 3 Sherman tanks and Carroll O'Connor as a two star General.

Kelly discovers 13 million dollars in gold bars are in a bank 3o miles behind enemy lines guarded by three Tiger tanks and supporting German infantry. The war is almost over and the Americans are advancing and will liberate the town in a few days. Kelly must steal the the gold ASAP. With lots of American soldiers help, they attack, destroy and kill the Germans with the exception of one Tiger tank that won't leave protecting the front of the bank. With the help of a German Sergent in the Tiger tank they blow the bank and steal the gold right before Carroll O'Connor the two star General and his army drive into town with a parade/liberation party going on. Great movie 5 stars.

Where Eagles Dare is an action packed WWII spy story...attacking a German stronghold on top of an almost inaccessible mountain. Clint Eastwood as an American Lieutenant Ranger working for the British. Richard Burton stars as a British spy disguised as a German Major. Lots of twists and turns in this spy story. The British MI6 has been infiltrated by German spies and Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood and a group of loyal (NOT) British spy/soldiers must rescue (or so it seams) a captured American General (NOT) who has the plans for the D day invasion before he talks. Turns out the loyal enlisted British spy/soldier help are German spies as well as the Corporal American (an actor)playing the part of the captured American General. All this was to get the list of the German spies that had infiltrated MI6. Lots if action, a pretty Fraulein, explosions, massive amounts of gunfight. Great movie 5 stars

The Dirty Dozen is about a non conformist American Major(Lee Marvin) that does not get along with the higher brass ( Earnest Borgnine a two star General and others. George Kennedy is a war games observer Major. Lots of other stars. The non conformist Major must whip twelve US soldier prisoners, many sentenced to hang into a fighting group to kill as many high level German officers in a heavily guarded resort (pleasure palace). We see their advanced training and them refusing to shave in cold water. Hence they are not allowed soap or shaving. They become the Dirty Dozen. Lots of battle action. Many Germans killed at the resort and almost all the dirty Dozen are killed. Great movie 5 stars

Battle ground was a B/W movie standard version about the counter attack by the Germans and defending of Baston by what became ""The Bastards of Baston"". Van Johnson and Richard Montalban star. We see the human side of war in this movie. Many of the GIs show their human frailties and fears as well as their bravery. There are Germans sneaking into the US ranks disguised as US soldiers. Password after password. Lots of battle action and a nice scene of a French young women supporting two small children after their parents were killed and how well they interacted with the small group of US soldiers. This movie surprised me as I only expected a 3 star movie. A great movie 4 1/2 stars.

I wish TCM would of done this correction right with 4 individual DVDs individually wrapped in their own jewel boxes. Not. Two double sided DVDs. For this reason I gave this DVD collection 4 1/2 stars.",1330732800,3,3570,4.676751592356688

3751861,4,B001PO556E,"These are four of classic war movies two of which are particularly tops: Where Eagles Dare and Kelly's Heroes.  I saw these many years ago, when they were hot from the press, but they are good forever.  Watching Clint Eastwood when still young, and Donald Sutherland, playing the role of a hippy tank commander who challenges a Tiger Tank German commander with an open pistol pack so as to outdraw the german tank... that by itself was worth it!  Richard Burton getting into a cloak and dagger spy intrigue in the midst of a who did what complicated affair was able to keep one on the edge of the chair.... that was great!!  Definitely, this package was a great offer!!",1274486400,,669,4.55
3751862,5,B001PO556E,"The TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: World War II - Battlefront Europe is a superb set of four of the best war movies of them all.

First on the list is Kelly's Heroes, an unusual comedy about GIs attempting to steal Nazi gold. Great suspense and witty humor (not to mention a hippy, played by Donald Sutherland) make this film entertaining and memorable.

Secondly, we have the Dirty Dozen, a fantastic story of twelve condemned men granted freedom if they agree to do a suicide mission. Great acting and a thrilling climax make this film great.

Thirdly, we have Where Eagles Dare, an incredible spy thriller in the tradition of the Guns of Navarone. With about a thousand plot twists and stunning action, Where Eagles Dare is near-perfect.

Lastly, we have Battleground, the oldest film in this collection. Pacing issues aside, this is one great film, and features some of Hollywood's greatest actors. Definitely recommended.",1267833600,7,934,5.006451612903226
