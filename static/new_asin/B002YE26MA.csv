4013036,5,B002YE26MA,"My 9 month old son loved the Pajanimals on TV so much that we just knew we needed to own this DVD.  Everynight before his bath, we pick a few songs to watch and it helps us to ""Stick to the Plan.""  The music is great and my husband and I look forward to Pajanimal time each night.",1269388800,,280,3.810344827586207

4013038,5,B002YE26MA,"Pajanimals are the best thing for a two year old.  Our daughter first saw them on Sprout, but I wanted a DVD that could played instead of two minute songs that we had to keep rewinding.  It has about 25 minutes of Pajanimals and then some other cartoons.  Pajanimals are a wonderful set of characters for little ones.",1266364800,8,317,4.431034482758621
4013039,5,B002YE26MA,"We purchased this dvd and the audio download for our 2 year old for Christmas. We watch the dvd every day when it is time to settle down in preparation for a nap or bathtime and bed. At tuck in time, we play the audio and he sings himself to sleep. He also sings bits of the songs to himself during the day which is pretty funny considering the only other songs he remembers are ""Happy Birthday,"" ""Twinkle-Twinkle,"" and ""Jingle Bells."" We take this with us when we travel also to ensure that his routine still has some of the same elements.",1266278400,,540,4.303921568627451
4013040,5,B002YE26MA,"My daughter loves the pajanimals and I am so glad that the show is on DVD and CD.  We just got them today and my daughter wants to see it again and again and it is morning time.  Highly reccomend for all parents, well worth the money.",1265760000,,234,3.9574468085106385
4013041,5,B002YE26MA,"I first saw the Pajanimals on the Sprout Network which my 24 month old loves.  She loves them, as do I.  I tried to catch them to record on vcr but always messed it up.  She sings and dances along with them.  I am glad the DVD was available, now I can put her to bed on my schedule not the TV's, it is the only thing she wants to see before turning in!",1264550400,,352,3.7162162162162162
4013042,4,B002YE26MA,"This video is one of the sweetest sleep-aids you can have for your infant or toddler child. The songs are pleasant (even if some of the lyrics are strained) and the animal muppets are friendly and non-threatening. My grandson goes right to sleep after one of the songs is played two or three times -- and after a while you will know them all so well that you can sing them to your baby yourself.  The whole purpose of the video is to provide a pleasant visual background for soothing lullabies, and it does it simply and beautifully.",1264464000,,533,4.438775510204081
4013043,5,B002YE26MA,"We have the CD and the DVD and my son asks to watch it whenever he is getting ready for bed.  He will not sit still for any other show, but loves these videos!  great product!",1264291200,,175,3.8333333333333335
4013044,5,B002YE26MA,"I viewed a handful of these videos on a complimentary channel through my cable provider and my daughter seemed to like them so I ordered it.  I thought it would be more of a ""show"" where the pajanimals are going to sleep but instead its a series of seperate videos (not connected, not a running story line)where the pajanimals are singing about going to sleep.  My daughter is 16 months old and loves music and although I don't let her watch tv (and shes never shown much interest at her friends house in tv either) I let her watch the pajanimals while I clean up the kitchen before bathtime and she loves them.  She dances, she carries the DVD case around when I won't let her watch them and she's always excited to see them.  Im a Jim Henson fan anyway which is why I gave it a try but I love it and its an excellent price.  The only annoying thing is that at the beginning of each video a ""Jim Henson/Pajanimals"" logo pops up- doesn't bother my daugher, just me.  Catchy tunes, not annoying.  I'm looking forward to other pajanimals items being available for purchase.  Theres also sleep advice for parents by the authors of the ""sleep easy solution"", I haven't viewed that section yet but the Pajanimals are great.
Recommended for any child that loves music- a great way to wind down at the end of the day.",1263340800,6,1310,4.406639004149378

4013048,4,B002YE26MA,"At first my 1.5 year old was not really liking the Pajanimals. He had never seen the show before (neither had I), but I got this dvd based on reviews, it's apart of the N Circle network of children's entertainment (I have come to trust their entertainment value for children's entertainment as all of their shows are entertaining yet educational), and I was seeking some more videos that would be nice for my child to watch right before bedtime to help him settle down. The Pajanimals grew on him after a watching this dvd and another one of the Pajanimal dvds a few times. Now he is fond of them and enjoys watching the episodes. Otherwise I was afraid I was going to have to donate the Pajanimals video/s to goodwill.  There's 4 episodes. The dvd is about 1 hour long. I find myself singing the theme song sometimes. It's cute. LoL I like how the episodes teaches children why sleep is important and how to face all the issues kids encounter with bedtime and real life situations with playmates (ie. practice makes perfect, scared of the dark, nightmares, can't sleep, when to wake up, sharing is caring, etc)",1476489600,,1111,4.582914572864322

4013052,5,B002YE26MA,My son loves this. I love Jim Henson. So it's a win-win. I will say that the episodes on this are not like episodes on TV. But they're still great shows to watch together.,1469923200,,171,4.0588235294117645

4013054,5,B002YE26MA,"My almost 2 year old daughter loves music and doesn't follow full episodes of things well. She has little to no patience. (Read high energy). So while I can't see the complaints of people wanting full episodes, the extended song after song format is perfect for my purposes. To help my princess relax at bed time.

What I like most here, is that the songs aren't rediculously horrid like in many children's TV/Movie DVDs. There is actually an excellent use of tone and melody. The vocal range is some of the music is quite beautiful, and the voices have great technical execution. People who think kids don't understand range or vocal melody, understand less about children than they do about music.

I am extremely satisfied with this DVD, it's all music which is exactly what I wanted. The context matters less than the results.",1465516800,,830,4.756944444444445

4013074,5,B002YE26MA,"Excellent DVD!
I purchased this DVD because years ago, after producing my first baby, I walked up and down the aisles of a nice posh bookstore where I found ""The Sleepeasy Solution"". Yes, in the days of sleep and unlimited choices for your free time. Oh yes, free time was everywhere in those days too.

Baby number three is two years old but the one who struggles with sleep yet is the four-year old boy. I did what any sleep-deprived, bordering-alcoholic mamma would do when the lightbulb finally switches on. I pulled out the blessed book and googled the authors and discovered that the Pajanimals is what happened when the Sleapeasy Solutionists co-brained with Jim Henson's people!!

I was very pleasantly uh, pleased. The little mop creatures and setting were all very cute and just well put together. The music, the story, etc... I must say that it was very easy to remember the different principles hammered in the book. It all came back to me through the catchy little tunes, the repetition and all the perfectly interjected parent messages in there. It really was well out together. It has helped my diminutive man to become acquainted with what we do at night. The little routine has helped tremendously.

I must add that it is a very helpful aid to those parents who have co-parents or other semi-helpful rearing adults in the household who have not been interested in reading up on the subject from the start. This helps the information kind of seep through the environment ""unnoticed"", like second-hand smoke, except much more helpful, and you don't have to smell like, well, smoke.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has children. Whether you are already sleeping easily or you are feeling as haggard as I am, this will help lighten your load. Single moms, unite! I am married, but okay.  This is the only one of the series that I have purchased or seen, so I can only speak for this one.

Thank you so much!!!",1438992000,2,1933,4.687315634218289

4013077,5,B002YE26MA,"My grandsons loved watching the Pajanimals.  They had needed bedtime videos to get them ready to sleep, as all the daytime ones just revved them up.  Pajanimals fit the bill!  With bedtime stories, soothing music, and bright colors, they caught the boys's attention and soon after we started watching them, were yawning (for that matter, so was I).

She really enjoyed this one. It has quite a few episodes, and the songs are really cute. For the most part, the tone of the DVD is bedtime so it's great to play before she lays down to bed.

It's literally the worst DVD ever if you've already been exposed to pajanimals.  If you haven't, then maybe it is for you.  I wish this DVD was never made for sale.

This DVD does not contain ANY full episodes - only selected songs that play AFTER children talk about their nighttime issues (getting ready for bed, scary noises, etc.) AND two ""experts"" give advice on how to address said issues & explain why the following Pajanimals song might help. My daughter has no interest in watching a bunch of people talk, and the Pajanimal clips are all only 2 minutes each. All of the songs are available on youtube - unless your kid likes listening to other people talk about sleep, I suggest you go there & make a playlist (or better yet, use a program like the YouTube Downloader to get your own copies of the songs.)

4013103,5,B002YE26MA,"A few reviews have complained about the advice portion of the show. Well I have never bothered watching that. It's a special feature that we just haven't clicked on.

I love this cartoon! We have owned this show for almost a year now. We have been watching it almost daily since then. My 3 year old jams out to the jiggle jumble and jump song and my 16mon old starts to giggle and dance when we flash the case at him. It is comprised of a series of bedtime related SONGS. Not episodes! There is a song about bad dreams, staying in bed till morning time, getting ready for bed, being afraid of the dark, sounds in the dark, saying goodnight/separation anxiety and getting tired for bed(jiggle jumble and jump).

The songs are easy to learn and with some extra help from parents turn into fun learning activities. Our kids now sing the song about getting ready for bed as we are in the tub and brushing teeth.(super cute babbles from the youngest) And how the dark isn't scary and mom and dad are just across the hall of they need us.

The biggest problem I have is the order the songs are in, the getting tired and routine songs are closer to the middle and they should be first. No big deal though. I've already bought 3 more as greatly appreciated gifts!

The cartoon lasts 30minutes and has tons of ads before and after. Once you get through to the menu screen it does play on a loop which is nice for long bedtime battles! Otherwise, a 30minute cutoff is perfect for a toddler bedtime.
The ads only bother the grownups, my kids have yet to complain about them.

*update*
My children still love this cartoon. My son who is now 2 still gets excited just by seeing the artwork on the case and I swear we've played a groove into the DVD. We purchased two other Pajanimals shows for Christmas and the kids don't like the episodes as much as just the songs. This isn't played nightly anymore, thank goodness!

Best part of our night is sitting down together just before bed in our jammies & watch Pajanimals & sing all our favorite songs. This is our favorite show. Having said that this isn't my favorite DVD because its older & uses the old set. You looks like an ""early"" attempt, possibly when the show had first started before it became popular. The episodes that are coming on TV right how seem brighter & better in terms of camera angles, fluidity & just being pleasurable to watch. My only other gripe is that is is quite iterally all songs. There are no stories mixed in as usual so you don't get to see your other character favorites like the bedtime bunny & beavers. So that is a bit of a dissapointment & unfortunatley means my daughter loses interest. She enjoys the talking as much as the singing and seeing the other characters & how they interact.

My son has no interest in watching a bunch of people talk, and the Pajanimal clips are all only 2 minutes each.  All of the songs are available on youtube - unless your kid likes listening to other people talk about sleep, I suggest you go there & make a playlist (or better yet, use a program like the YouTube Downloader to get your own copies of the songs.)

Trying to catch Pajanimals while they were on TV or even rewinding the few songs available on cable OnDemand was getting annoying, so I went in search of a DVD.  Yay, there was one!

The first thing I noticed about this DVD was that when you put it in, you're given the option of viewing Previews or Feature (not sure exactly what they called it, but you get the idea).  This may seem like a small detail.  But anyone with a cranky baby knows that being able to skip straight to the main menu instead of hitting fast forward through multiple previews is worth its weight in gold!

Once you get to the main menu you can choose to play all the songs or to choose the song you want.  I like this because some nights I turn on the play all and my daughter will just sit there and play with her toys and watch.  Other nights I'll hold her and listen to Morningtime multiple times because it's the only one that will calm her down so well.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with small children, yes even babies!  I've been telling all my mommy friends about it.",1312416000,,1315,4.279352226720648

My son loves the pajanimals so I thought it would be nice for him to have a dvd so he could watch them commercial free. WRONG.
The first 30 minutes of this 90 minute dvd is the Pajanimals bedtime songs, the next hour is commercials for cartoons that are ""now available on dvd"". You cant skip these trailers. They are played immediately after the show.
It isn't that they are bad cartoons. Its just that now when my son asks to watch them I have to tell him that they aren't on TV and we are not going to buy a cd for every cartoon they advertise.

I just think that when you pay for a dvd it should be commercial free or at least they shouldn't make it so that you cant skip their ads!",1298505600,12,722,4.006944444444445
