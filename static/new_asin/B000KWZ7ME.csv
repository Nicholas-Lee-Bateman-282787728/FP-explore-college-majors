8159588,5,B000KWZ7ME,"I have been a ""FIRMie"" for many years and have always gravitated towards the workouts that Tracie Long led for the FIRM.  She is a solid, patient and thorough instructor.  She will challenge you, but you'll be glad for it.
Jen Carmen brings a bubbly energy to the workout(but not overly so)-  she truly looks like she is enjoying every minute!
Susan Harris shows what a lifetime of fitness can bring.  She looks as fit as I remember her from the early FIRM days and I enjoy her calm and consistent encouragement even when you're fighting through the moves.  :)
Each instructor is careful about helping you with proper form and technique- so you avoid injuring yourself or working the wrong muscle(s).

I have been really focusing on using the FIRM for my cardio/ strength training (their trademark)- but was frustrated because I could not get rid of my ""mommy tummy"".  After only a few weeks of using this set,  I am aleady seeing results!  I feel the difference in my midsection throughout the day and am more conscious of my posture.  I have no doubt that I'll lose that last inch or so with these workouts.

One of my favorite parts of this set is that there is cardio mixed into the core work.  The variety of core/cardio/strength in this series guarantees that I won't get bored. A big plus for me!  The moves are simple enough for a novice exerciser to catch on, yet challenging enough for the advanced to feel like they are still working.

Highly recommend this series to all fitness levels.",1368057600,,1498,4.582706766917293
8159589,3,B000KWZ7ME,"These are functional training workouts. It's not bad, but I would not consider this a workout on its own.
Functional training can be great for building stability and for improving everyday movements, but you still need to add strength training and more intense cardio to your routine to improve your overall fitness.

I think this would be great to ADD to your training. I usually do these videos AFTER weight training or cardio.
These videos alone did not raise my heart rate over 60% at any time.
This is just my personal experience....",1287705600,,538,4.78494623655914
8159590,5,B000KWZ7ME,"I love Tracie. It's really nerdy I know, but everything she does is fantastic. I own many of the old firm, as well as the fitprime she's done. What i love most about the TLT is they are such different moves. They are more like sports drills than your standard lifting and box work. Finding your core took my belly muscles to a whole new level. I love the side plank work in bbbb. Everything is creative, and a great mix with your other work outs.",1224288000,3,446,4.1976744186046515
8159591,5,B000KWZ7ME,"I cannot say enough good things about the Tracie Long Training program. These workouts are EXCELLENT. I have been working out for 15 years and have many tapes and DVDs. However, this is, by far, one of the best workout programs I have ever done. The moves are different and challenging. The use of plates/towels works the legs and arms in new ways the produce fantastic results. Also, the use of the weighted ball adds a new dimension to these workouts. You get a full body workout with these DVDs, and the time seems to fly by. They never seem like they are 40 minutes to an hour because the routines never get boring. The program builds endurance, burns calories and builds slender muscles. The cueing is great, and the set and music are nice as well. This is a set that I will definitely use for years to come.",1216339200,3,813,4.426666666666667
8159592,5,B000KWZ7ME,"I have been a fan of the Firm for many years and an even bigger fan of Tracie Long and Susan Harris. These workouts are cutting edge, comprehensive and kick your butt. I highly recommend the entire package.",1212624000,,206,4.447368421052632
8159593,5,B000KWZ7ME,"Amazing! I just ordered these a few weeks ago, but these DVDs are my new favorites-and so far I have only done 2 of them! (Strength in Movement and the Endurance one). Let me just say that I consider myself to be in pretty good shape but this workout definitely challenged me (I was dripping sweat!) and is a great change of pace.

There are many facets of these videos that I like, but I really enjoy the fact that most of the exercises are unique, compound (working 2 or more muscle groups at once),  and really challenge your balance and stabilizer muscles. Like I said, I thought I was in good shape but I had such a hard time staying balanced during a lot of the moves that I realized how much work I have left to do! Also, many of these exercises are VERY unique and tough, and that is amazing considering how many exercise dvds are out there!

A couple of things-The moves are tough, and you may need to go through them a few times before you master them. You also need a variety of hand weights (3-10 lbs.) and a paper plate or rag (there are some sliding moves). Also-good form is CRUCIAL during this video-especially during the balance moves! I have pretty bad knees so I definitely had to keep checking my form because some of the moves go pretty fast. So work at your own pace, but always keep that weight in your heels ;-) All of the videos are over 50 mins. long so it is a nice long workout with a good combination of strength and cardio (at least in SIM and Endurance, I still haven't done the other two yet).

So overall-such an amazing investment! You will not be disappointed, trust me!!!",1179446400,6,1607,4.311258278145695
8159594,5,B000KWZ7ME,"Like the other reviewers have already pointed out, this series is geared towards the intermediate to advanced.  I can't say enough great things, especially about the Endurance DVD.  If you're tired of the same old moves / routines, give any of these DVDs a try.  I particularly like these because of the emphasis in functional strength - what's the use of being able to leg press 300 lbs if you can't last on a 20 minute hike?  Use these along with your regular cardio and strength routine and you WILL see great results.",1176681600,14,521,4.56989247311828
8159595,5,B000KWZ7ME,"I actually stumbled across this hoping to find new Tracie Long workouts, but as long as I'm here, I will submit my two cents' worth.  I have been doing these four workouts for over a year now, following 15 years doing Firm workouts.  I thought I was in good shape, but these put me on an entirely new plane.  Their emphasis on core (whether you know it or not), upper back, and stabilizers has completely changed the way I do everything.  I now have strength in smaller muscles groups I didn't even know I had, contributing significantly to working the larger muscle groups even harder and more effectively.  I had strong glutes before from good old squats, dips, lunges, and tall-box leg presses.  Now, I have strong glutes all the way up into my lower back and hamstrings that could lift a Volkswagen (thank you, Susan Harris).  My entire midsection, front and back, is rock hard.  My upper back is stronger than it has ever been.  The workouts are extraordinarily efficient and pack more into an hour than any others I have done.  I have never been in such good shape.  I also highly recommend the four Tracie Long Productions (post-Firm) workouts, which came out just before these.",1176508800,23,1185,4.649038461538462
8159596,5,B000KWZ7ME,"This series of four DVDs is the latest offering from Tracie Long Training (TLT).  Although many recall instructor Tracie Long-Matthews from her Firm and FitPrime days, she has since struck out on her own down a new path, that of functional fitness training.  Functional fitness is designed to train your body for how it moves in everyday life, and there is a focus on core work, balance, and agility along with more traditional strength training.  In addition, the body is worked through all planes of motion, so you see a lot more twisting, turning, an moving on an angle in functional work.  The workouts have a very strong, athletic feel to them, and the wide variety of exercises in each makes the time fly by.

This series is a follow-up to Tracie's first functional fitness efforts with her previous company, Tracie Long Productions (TLP).  Although the TLPs workouts (which included Core Foundations, Functional Strength, Dynamic Strength & Power, Nitty Gritty & the Whole Shebang, and the Functional Foundations set) were great workouts themselves, they were also extremely challenging and inaccessible to most people.  With her new TLT workouts, Tracie has created workouts that are much more user-friendly, from a much-improved set and camera work to the inclusion of three levels of modifiers (easier, intermediate, and more challenging).  All of the workouts in the TLT series follow this new format, and I have broken down each of the four workouts individually below.

Better Burns...Better Buns (BBBB).  Led by Tracie Long, 56 minutes.  This is a mostly cardio workout that also includes lower body toning.  It uses a medicine ball, and optional balance stick, and rags or paper plates (depending on whether you have smooth flooring or carpet) for sliding your feet along the floor.  The cardio is fun, with lots of athletic-type drills, including some plyometric exercises, and the ""rag work"" will definitely fry your lower body.  There is also two very challenging core work segments, a plank section early in the workout and a very unique crunch series at the end.  Finally, as with all of the DVDs in this series, there is a great stretch series to finish, which includes yoga-based hip openers here.  I think this is my favorite video of the series.

Endurance for Movement (EFM).  Led by Tracie Long, 60 minutes.  This workout alternates cardio and strength work, and it uses a stability ball, several sets of weights, and a rag/plate.  The is more high impact cardio than in the other TLTs, and I found the first half of this workout particularly challenging.  The weight work is quite unique, and I found the rag work a bit easier than in BBBB overall, although the ""mountain climbers"" with both feet on the rags were extremely challenging!  The final stretches do a great job of utilizing the stability ball.  I think this is the toughest of the 4 TLT workouts, and I found it to be the most similar to Tracie prior TLP series.

Strength in Movement (SIM).  Led by Jen Carmen, 55 minutes.  This an interval workout which alternates cardio and strength work.  It uses a medicine ball for the cardio and several sets of weights for the strength moves.  Much of the upper body training emphasizes posture, and the lower body work includes many different squat/lunge variations (ie, 1-legged squats, side lunges, transverse lunges, etc.)--as a result, I always really feel this workout in my glutes the next day!  I didn't find the cardio segments here to be quite as fun as in the above two workouts and I didn't like the core work as much, but again, the final stretches are very good.

Finding Your Core (FYC).  Led by Susan Harris, 49 minutes.  This is the only TLT workout that doesn't include cardio intervals.  Rather, it is a strength workout which uses a stability ball plus various sets of weights to work your entire body while emphasizing your core.  Like SIM, the upper body work contains many excellent moves to benefit your posture in general and to train your shoulders in particular.  The lower body is targeted with various pelvic tilts/glute squeezes on the ball plus an extremely challenging hamstring work segment towards the end.  A nice 6 1/2 minute stretch segment using the ball concludes this workout.

If you are an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser and want to work out smarter, not harder, you can't go wrong with the TLT set--highly recommended!",1170115200,48,4396,4.923913043478261
