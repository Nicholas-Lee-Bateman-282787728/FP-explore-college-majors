4858300,1,B005QDU1D2,Bought the movie through Loving the classics (movie crazy 13).  Would not play for more than 15 minutes then would lock.  Was marked as a DVD/R but was a DVD/RW.  Video was terrible.  (what managed to play before lockup).  Called company several times with no answer or call back.  Bad rating is for seller,1386633600,5,306,4.574074074074074

I haven't been able to find this movie in any format,  VHS or DVD.  I would prefer DVD.  I once thought it was the movie Battan or even Back to Battan.  The movie is with Lloyd Nolan.",1332633600,2,304,3.9344262295081966

4858304,5,B005QDU1D2,"An overly simple film depicting overly simplified situations, characters and relationships in the first days following Pearl Harbor in the Philippines.  But I'm rating this film on the real story-line that existed back then when American Pacific outposts were being asked to fight on alone when death, destruction and defeat were at their doorsteps .. and when that was all we could see and feel back home too, back when we were all looking desperately for America's courage .. and our own too.",1457308800,,494,4.951807228915663
4858305,4,B005QDU1D2,"Great Obscure WWII show has crew of Americans forming up when everyone else is surrendering. They take a remote Japanese radio station to stop its propaganda broadcasts, convinced the Japs will ""come to them"" to get it back. The great Loyd Nolan takes over when their agreed-upon leader falls; babe Carol Landis wanders in, a refuge from fighting elsewhere. They spend much of the movie defending their hilltop compound. Several good action scenes and some romance for the lady in your life. True courage does not mean this is a propaganda movie, its just good action and fine job of acting. Rich quality B&W movie with excellent audio gets the award for most evocative movie title of the war -- Manilla's Calling, and it wants you.",1456012800,,732,4.817460317460317

4858318,4,B005QDU1D2,"This film was made by 20thCentury Fox in 1943. Like so many such movies, it was to bolster American patriotism and support of the war here on the home front. If it was shown to troops, I'll wager it drew some real laughs and head-shaking, as well as some wolf whistles for the only female, ""Edna"", an American show girl somehow trapped in the jungles of the Philippines in 1942(?), played by bombshell pin up actress Carole Landis.  The rest of the cast is all male, led by Lloyd Nolan, Cornel Wilde, and others you will recognize from the other movies of the era. One actor who deserves billing, but did not get it, is Leonard Strong, an Idaho born actor who played Japanese bad guys for thirty years in Hollywood!
  The plot:  A group of American workers for the ""Philippine Bell Telephone Company""  has put together a ramshackle guerilla group and are destroying phone and radio communications equipment and stations to deny them to the Japanese. They wind up on top of a rock Mesa at a former substation, surrounded by the enemy, as a few other people wander in. The story depicts that: the enemy is inhuman and capeable of mutilating and torturing helpless captives; the Philippine people were gallant but leaderless people who needed American support and leadership; and the Americans - made up of many nationalities, religions, ages, intelligences, and yes, sexes, are all OK, gallant, selfless ""Joes""!
  Plot is full of predictable and hokey stuff, like shooting down an attacking Japanese "" Messerschmitt Me-109 Zero"" with rifles! Stuff like that. Don't expect the language or plot to be ""PC""  either...a ""jap is a jap"", most pretty American girls are former....well, not the type to take home to mother, even if they have hearts of gold!  And actor James Gleason gets really ""over the top"" with his take on an Irish brogue and a hot-headed Irish temper. Sheesh, one would think Ireland is the world source of inarticulate morons!!!
  Despite all this, I wanted this movie. Saw it on TV as a kid...it impressed me with it's conclusion. Still does. I won't spoil it for you...but it is an ""American flag waver"", so you might try to guess. Careful, you might be surprised!
Thanks to AMAZON  for helping me collect it! Oh, and note this is a beautiful copy from the 20th Century Fox vaults directly to dvd, not from a video tape. Image is clear and sharp and beautiful B&W.",1426291200,11,2379,4.706024096385542
4858319,5,B005QDU1D2,this is a great movie buy it from amazon and see it the best,1425686400,,60,3.357142857142857
4858320,5,B005QDU1D2,"Can't believe this one somehow slipped by me throughout the years. The Five star rating applies only to the 20th Century Fox archive issue which offers a great, crisp looking print with outstanding clarity and background detail.
Lloyd Nolan and his ragtag commando outfit captures a fortress mansion atop a craggy mountain in the Philippians and then have to defend it against the Japanese onslaught while manning a radio station urging the locals not to give in to the enemy.
Great cast including Cornel Wilde, James Gleason, Ralph Byrd, Elisha Cook Jr., and Harold Huber among others make this a real who's who of B-players and character actors from the 1940s. Carole Landis is outstanding as the tough dame who arrives through Japanese lines in a bullet riddled car and surprisingly doesn't get in the way or cause a falling out among the boys as she pulls her own and handles a gun pretty well. Lots of quick clever snappy no-nonsense dialog and plenty of machine gun action as the bodies pile up to the exploding finale. High on entertainment, high on action, high on propaganda and flag waving, which is to be expected as this was 1942 and early into WW2. To me this one goes near the top of my favorite WW2 movies though it took me long enough to finally see this seventy year old gem. And movies like MINILA CALLING are always the ones I like best, small budgeted programmers that really pay off big. A classic.",1421020800,15,1419,4.657370517928287
4858321,5,B005QDU1D2,"If you are a fan of 1940s actress Carole Landis this is a must-see movie. I'm thrilled that Fox has finally released it on DVD. Carole plays a showgirl who gets trapped with a group of soldiers in the Phillipines during World War 2. Her costar and love interest is the always terrific Lloyd Nolan. This drama has a really wonderful cast including Cornel Wilde, Elisha Cook Jr, and James Gleason. The groups tries to stay alive on a plantation when they get attacked by the enemy. Manila Calling has some great action and a few heart wrenching scenes. It's one of my favorite WW2 movies and one of Carole's best performances. FIVE STARS!!!!!",1414972800,12,640,4.62280701754386
4858322,3,B005QDU1D2,"I have to say I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd itself,  I realise it is an old B/W film but there are parts where you just can't see the actors as it is so dark.

Not many of us appreciate the strength of character and sacrifices of these type of people in wartime, this story shows it to excellence.  Intriguing, scary and full of brilliance.",1503619200,,304,4.490909090909091
8483277,4,B005QDU1D2,"This is a wartime melodrama obviously made for inspiring American outrage at Japanese aggression. I happen to like period films of the WWII era, but others may find this film a little slow and without inevitable purpose. It must be remembered that when this film was made the outcome in the war for the United States was not secure, but even at that the portrayal of Japanese ruthlessness was justified. The acting is typical of 1940s films in general, and early WWII films in particular. Carol Landis role in this picture seems a little out of place, but it provides a good glimpse of an actress who was probably underestimated and not as appreciated as she should've been. She committed suicide in 1949, I believe. LLoyd Nolan is in his typical strong male best. This is especially a more obscure film to most '40s film lovers, and likely WWII history buffs as well. It's in my collection for that very reason.",1495497600,,912,4.670807453416149
8483278,5,B005QDU1D2,"I purchased this movie just so I could see it for the first time, as the probability of it being shown anywhere was pretty slim. I really love these war movies, which some would label as ""propaganda"" films, shot during the active years of WWII.

This one does require some suspended belief to truly enjoy, with only a handful of allied radio guerillas fighting off what seemed to be the whole Japanese army. Regardless, the action never really stops anywhere along the way, and the pacing of this film is really stellar. It moves on at a terrific speed, and almost could benefit from 15 to 30 more minutes.

The plot is pretty simple. The guerrilla group, including Lloyd Nolan, Cornel Wilde and James Gleason among others, take over an enemy radio station and concentrate their efforts on 1) Staying alive and 2) Recommissioning the station to battle the Japanese over the airwaves. I actually found the plot surprisingly interesting. I wasn't expecting much, and thought it would be more like BATAAN, where we just hang on to our seats to see who lives the longest.

Make no mistake, these fellas get picked off one by one, too, like all great war films from this era. There's just more dramatic episodes in-between to keep our spirits up. Of course you always have that one guy you wished had lived longer on screen, and for me that guy here was played by Louis Jean Heydt. He always seemed to play really likeable characters.

All the other character actors keep this boat affloat, with most of them playing against type (which is always fun!). Nolan, while often casted as the bad guy, plays a sensitive toughy. He looks much older than his 39 years here, especially in comparison to his ""pollished"" appearances in other movies during the same time period. Sometimes all that glitters is not gold, and I prefer this more ""natural"" look. Carol Landis steps in a few scenes on as a bar room dancer who everyone loves to look at, but also ridicule and demean. Nolan is first at bat in that regard, however there's no doubt he's got his eyes set on her from the beginning. Belittling her to her face, defending her behind her back, their relationship has some real grit to it. She was just a bit too ""dolled up"" for me in this role, however.

Elisha Cook Jr. loves on his precious pets, Martin Kosleck is no Nazi, and Harold Huber, uh, sambas? All casted against type, and refreshing. Some might ridicule the film's lighter moments as unrealistic given the group's circumstances, and they are. But for me, it gave an otherwise depressing film some sweetness. I liked it.

The ending is really inspiring, and worth the price of the disc in and of itself. Broadcasting finally, just as the bombs begin to drop all around them, Nolan gives his patriotic banter to the people of the Phillipines. As I watched the fade out, all I could think about were the true events of WWII. Sure, these characters are just fictionalized accounts, but they represent something much more real: All those that truly did sacrifice their lives for freedom--And chose to fight for what they believed was right, regardless of the highest price to pay.

Beautiful print, too. Thanks Fox. Almost makes up for my Pan and Scan version of April Love. Almost.",1487203200,,3229,4.674295774647887
