2648730,5,B000HXDWIM,Very well done....I wasn't sure at first when I saw it at the video store...the singing was incredible-the music haunting.  Chorus numbers exciting and captivating.  I haven't been excited about a musical like this since Les Mis and Rent!  I'm anxious to find the cd so I can listen in the car!,1170633600,3,294,4.615384615384615

2648734,1,B000HXDWIM,"Sad Sad Sad.....

While I am usually a big fan of most any theatre, this ""musical"" hits rock bottom for me.

A shame as it has some of the better talanted cast among it's ranks, but you can hear it in thier voices, ""Please save me from the bad scripting!"" every time they sing.

First off, there is NO dialoge whatsoever. This negates explaining anything which I suppose I could overlook if it was not for the ""Let's sing to explain something"" approach.

Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but in my experience, dialoge explains and moves the story. The music and dance numbers comes when there is so much emotion, it cannot be put into words. I was falling asleep during most of the movie because there really was no high emotional peak in the film, it was just a drab story that people happened to be singing to.",1167609600,4,807,4.4324324324324325
2648735,3,B000HXDWIM,"THIS is on DVD?  I knew there was a ""Ten Commandments"" musical starring Val Kilmer that opened and closed quickly in L.A., with less than enthusiastic reviews.  There was no cast recording.  I figured it would vanish into obscurity.  I was pretty surprised, then, to see the production available for viewing on DVD.  I wonder whether it was Val Kilmer's presence that made it so, or the world's predilection for Bible stories (the DVD contains subtitles in English, Spanish, French, German, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese!  That must be a record.).  In any case, I'm all for preserving theater on DVD, so I'm glad this exists.  I wish more shows made it to DVD. Is it a great musical? No.  But it still has its merits.

The main problem?  The storytelling.  Just not effective enough.  The show relies too heavily on assuming the audience's knowledge of the story of Moses, with characters given little dramatic motivation (In many cases, we don't even catch their names).  It helps to be familiar with the Old Testament-- or at least the animated movie ""The Prince of Egypt,"" which seems to be an inspiration for this retelling.  Even with some attempt to create tension between Moses and his brother Ramases, there is just not enough drama.  In a way, the show seems to be missing a plot, feeling too often like a series of connected checkpoints.  Moses sailing down the river into royalty. Check.  Moses finding out his true identity. Check.  Moses banished to the desert. Check.  Burning Bush. Check.  Parting of the Red Sea. Check.  Strangely, some of the moments you think would create the most drama are all but glossed over--  the various plagues unleashed when Moses' demands are not met by the Pharoah, for instance, pass by with little fanfare.  Even Moses' obtaining of the famous tablets (The Ten Commandments of the title, of course) is paid little attention and is undermined by the show's worst song-- some quasi-bluesy thing.  I also didn't care for the choice of having a little kid sing out the Commandments near the end with almost unbearable precociousness. Ugh.

All that said, the cast is really quite excellent.  The show is virtually sung through, with little dialogue, and the performers assembled here are all first-rate singers (even Kilmer is good, even if his range is considerably less than his co-stars).  They're so good, in fact, that you wish they were in a better-conceived musical.  The show is written in a pop-opera style, and if the score suffers from a certain ""sameness"" over the course of its two hours, the music by Patrick Leonard is mainly enjoyable-- and very well performed.  Even when the score falters, the cast is able to pick up the slack and make even the lesser songs soar impressively.  In fact, they even compensate to a large degree for the storytelling problems.  They work hard, and mostly succeed, to prevent what could have been total disaster in the hands of weaker performers.  The sets, costumes, and orchestrations also make the production look and sound attractive.  So whatever the critical reception, the show has enough good to recommend seeing-- at least in the form of this affordable and well directed DVD presentation.",1167350400,20,3190,4.878957169459963
2648736,2,B000HXDWIM,"I was amazed and delighted to see a video of The Ten Commandments: The Musical on the shelves.  I am pleased to report that I am among the lucky (?!) few who witnessed this production first hand.  The show was in the beautiful Kodak Theatre, home of the Academy Awards.  Seating capacity in the Kodak varies from 2200 to 3500 depending on the seating arrangement.  The evening I attended, there could not have been more than 300 people there.  You can only imagine how many were left after intermission.  Personally, I stayed strictly out of morbid curiosity.

Long and short of it (and believe me, this puppy is on the LONG side,) there are some redeeming musical moments.  Some of the ensemble pieces are quite nice.

The collectors of all that is camp will need to add this to their ensemble just for the parting of the Red Sea scene alone.  Maybe it was spectacular from the sixth row of the third balcony, but from where I was sitting it looked like the whole thing was made out of sliding glass shower doors.  I can't wait to see what it looks like on film!

All in all, this one is not to be missed, but you might have to take it in small doses.",1166054400,2,1152,4.331775700934579
2648737,1,B000HXDWIM,"Often imitation is a form of flattery.  In the case of this musical, it is not.  The ideal of a musical based on a Biblical hero with a modern score and little dialogue has been done before with great success.  To attempt to repeat that formula by lesser artists was folly.  The worst aspect of this musical is found it it's music and lyrics.  The music is totally out of place and the lyrics are terrible at best.  The choreography looks foolish. sometimes laughable and I am surprised by Bob Iscoves unimaginative direction.  Living in Los Angeles, I too read the bad reviews and elected not to attend.  But was this musical as bad as the reviews claimed?  Oh yes and probably even worse on closer inspection.  It brings to the stage not even one interesting moment.

I saw this on Amazon's list and was intrigued.  I hadn't even heard of it (mostly because it closed before getting to Broadway).  This was a filmed show from its trial in Los Angeles - and it is wonderful.  I am sure there would have been some scenes deleted or shortened along the way (as is the case with most shows that open out of town), the basics are here and wonderful.

2648757,5,B000HXDWIM,"As well as the classical  theatre, I also have a passion for the ""Musical Theatre"" and when I saw this DVD of ""The Ten Commandments"" the musical; I thought that maybe it had gone too far.
But curiosity finally got the best of me, so I purchased it to see for myself if it would work.
After the first few minutes I was convinced that it did.
What a conception, to take this movie masterpiece and turn it into a musical.
My faith in the musical theatre was once again restored.
I must commend the authors of this work; the composer Patrick Leonard and the lyricist Maribeth Derry for having the conviction to write this masterpiece.
Supported by a staunch team, such as Giantito Burchellard's magnificent sets and Max Azira's brilliant costumes. The special effect were amazing as well and all competently directed by Dennis Rosenblatt.
The cast is one of the best I have heard in many years. Headed off by Val Kilmer as Moses (I didn't know he could sing!)  what a voice. Then there is Adam lambert as Joshua, Kevin Errley as Ramses, Allison Porter as Miriam, Lawren Kennedy as Nefertari; Nicholas Rodriguez as Aaron; all excellent singer/actors.
The staging at the Kodak theatre, Hollywood, was brilliant with the use of projection and it's many special effects including ""the burning bush, the writing of the 10 commandments and the plagues""; brilliant!!
This is a must see musical and I endorse it completely. The songs alone are stand-out-hits on their own. Buy it, play it and enjoy ""The Ten Commandments"" the Musical.",1315180800,3,1522,4.761363636363637

Watching some dumb Rubber Baby go riding down the stage? Ehh, not so much.

Anyhow, that's my review. Don't waste your money on this flop! Just watch it on Youtbue for free. Listen to the brilliant Bithia and her Egyptian counterpart. Skip the rest.

Oh, yeah, Val Kilmer. Excuse me while I take my No-Doze.  Again, not so much. He did a good job as the voice of someone from ""Prince of Egypt"".  Was it Moses? Yah, it was Moses. That was a Good Moses. The all singing Moses? Again, Eh.",1286236800,,802,4.256578947368421

2648772,5,B000HXDWIM,"""The Ten Commandments: The Musical"" starring Val Kilmer as Moses, and features ADAM LAMBERT as Joshua, the man who succeeded Moses, and ultimately brought the Jews to the Promised Land, via Mount Sinai.

Overall, I thought that Patrick Leonard, the composer, and Maribeth Derry, the lyricist, did an admirable job adapting The Exodus into a musical, once you contemplate the magnitude of the narrative.

Considering that I know the story reasonably well, I have two rather significant complaints about the storyline.

My first complaint is the fact that Joshua, portrayed by Adam Lambert, was not even ALIVE when the Exodus began. God told Moses that because no-one had enough faith to trust in God, every original person who physically left Egypt would die before they found the ""Promised Land."" Moses, Aaron, Miriam, and the entire original Hebrew nation walked in the desert for FORTY YEARS because of that. The first time we hear about Joshua in the Bible is when Moses picks Joshua with several other men to participate in a reconnaissance expedition to check out the land of Canaan from where they brought back grapes, pomegranates, and figs. Again, when Joshua first appeared onto the scene, it is about halfway through the book of Numbers, which is the Third Book of the Five Books of the Torah or the Pentateuch: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. Moses was 80 when he implored Ramses to let the Hebrews leave Egypt, and 120 years old when he died, at the end of Deuteronomy. Based on that info, I would deduce Moses was about 100 years old when Joshua first appears.

My second complaint is that one of the songs is chronologically incorrect, which would be ""The Horns of Jericho."" When the walls surrounding Jericho actually tumbled down, it was many years AFTER Moses' death.

Other than that, I thought the show was truly entertaining!

Act 1 begins with Seti, the Pharaoh who would become Moses' stepfather, commanding his soldiers to kill the firstborn son of each household, eventually bringing Moses into his own house. Moses and Ramses become adults, Moses' banishment, meeting his wife, talking to God through the burning bush, returning to Egypt and his eventual reunion with Ramses, pleading with Ramses to let the Hebrews leave, going through all the plagues, culminating with Ramses' son dying, and Ramses telling Moses that the Hebrews could finally leave Egypt, with his blessing.

Act 2 begins with the Hebrews celebrating their freedom from Ramses, goes through the terror of Ramses coming after them to make them slaves again, the crossing of the Red Sea, creating the Golden Calf idol, and ends with Moses bringing down the Ten Commandments from God.

Val Kilmer does a very nice job singing, especially since I knew he did his own singing when he portrayed `Jim Morrison' in Oliver Stone's movie, ""The Doors."" There were a couple of songs where Val speak-sings, similar to what Rex Harrison did in the movie ""My Fair Lady,"" but I put that more to the song itself, rather than Val's vocal techniques. In addition, when Moses confronts the Burning Bush, God speaks with such a weird robotic monotone voice, which I found to be rather peculiar, and not in a good way. I think that anyone attempting to do ""God's Voice,"" his voice should be dramatic and flowing, like Patrick Stewart, or James Earl Jones.

There were a couple of scenes which were creatively staged that caught my attention. One happens in the beginning, where Moses' mother places baby Moses in the basket to float down the river, and Pharaoh's Wife draws Moses out of the river: a section of the stage floor disappears so it seems that a river is actually there! In addition, the scene when Moses is getting ready to part the Red Sea, so they can finally escape Pharaoh, is extremely inventive. I almost do not want to describe it, because I think it is worth seeing, and I honestly do not know if my description can do it justice.

You can tell that they recorded the show specifically for this DVD presentation, as they use several cameras. As a result, some of the visual effects are rather obvious. Though certain lighting effects COULD have happened on stage, I am leaning on the side of post-production video editing. Despite that, I would have enjoyed seeing this particular show live, just so I could have something to compare. Someone on Amazon.com justly mentions how some of the lighting effects when the Pharaoh, Moses' stepfather, appears, he gives off this golden glow, which was extremely artificial. Of course, when the tablets featuring the Ten Commandments glow from behind, I appreciate the gravity of the moment, but again, it was rather cheesy.

Adam, of course, does a WONDERFUL job as Joshua, and I can pick his voice out easily. Not only that, his character helps tell the story. Though ""Is Anybody Listening?"" is his principal solo as it is an entire song, he has many solos throughout the entire show. Considering the placement of this particular song, it is a major turning point in Moses' life.

Close to the show's finale, the Hebrews did not believe that Moses was ever returning from on top of Mount Sinai, despite what Aaron and Mariam told them, so they created an idol out of gold, and began to worship it. Consequently, when Moses appears with the Ten Commandments, then seeing the riotous behavior surrounding the idol, Moses is furious and throws the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments onto the ground, shattering into several pieces.

I think one of the most breathtaking moments of the entire show is when a young boy puts the pieces back together, and sings the Ten Commandments. He has such an angelic, Soprano voice, and sings with such innocence, one has to pause and actually listen to these basic laws that God gave the world. Might you remember Connie Talbot, the 6-year-old girl who sang ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on `Britain's Got Talent"" a couple of years ago? There is such purity, and innocence, in a voice like that. The young boy who sings the Ten Commandments has a similar voice.

One can purchase the DVD for under $10, which I think is worth the investment, as there are some entertaining bonuses on the DVD. One of them is the
""Behind the Scenes"" which features the main cast being interviewed, but ADAM is asked a question, and in full costume! There is also a Photo Gallery of the show, and Adam's ""Is Anybody Listening?"" opens the photo gallery in its entirety.

One thing that truly caught my eye about the total production of the show is that it was co-produced by Max Azria, who is THE Max Azria, of BCBG Max Azria! He also designed the costumes that the entire cast wore throughout the production.

Alisan Porter, portrays Moses' sister Mariam, and she has a significant role, with many wonderful songs, and solos. I think most people would be familiar with Alisan as ""Curly Sue"" opposite Jim Belushi.

Kevin Earley portrays Ramses, the man Moses ultimately confronts. He has been on Broadway for a few productions, such as ""Les Miserables,"" ""Thoroughly Modern Millie,"" and most recently ""A Tale of Two Cities."" I will have to check my Playbills, but I think I have seen Kevin in ""Thoroughly Modern Millie,"" and he did a spectacular job!

Luba Mason portrays Bithia, Pharaoh's Wife, who is Moses' Egyptian Mother. I have seen her on Broadway as `Lucy' in ""Jekyll & Hyde: the Musical"" opposite either Sebastian Bach or David Hasselhoff as both `Jekyll' AND `Hyde'.

Nita Whitaker portrays Zipporah, who becomes Moses' wife. She was in the movie ""The Bodyguard"" starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner as the `Oscar Singer.'

Ipale' portrays Seti, Ramses' father, has been in ""Xanadu"" with Olivia Newton-John as `the Photographer,' along with both ""The Mummy"" movies as, fittingly enough, Pharaoh Seti I.

For what it is worth, upon my initial viewing of this, earlier this week I thought that the melodies were nice, but something that I could almost hear at churches that use songs of the CCM {Contemporary Christian Music } genre throughout their services. Surprisingly, I have woken up with Moses' and Ramses first big song, ""When We Rule the World"" running through my head, along with some other songs from the DVD. These songs have substance to them, and I WANT IT ON CD!!!",1249171200,3,8264,4.846808510638298

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire production.  No, it wasn' any Hollywood stage; it took place in a theater, audience & all. The set wasn't elaborately adorned with ornate fixtures, but the production was REALLY GOOD!  Adam played Joshua & Val Kilmer was Moses.  The rest of the cast were unknown to me, but no matter.

2648790,5,B000HXDWIM,"Adam sings the best song, ""Is Anybody Listening?"" Even the New York times, reviewing the Los Angeles production in 2004, pointed him out as the best singer in the show and didn't even mention anyone else but Val Kilmer.  (I checked it out online.)  Adam has a few solo lines in other songs, but ""Is Anybody Listening?"" is all his. Adam is fun to watch (duh!) and appears throughout.  The other singers are generally very good (some better than others). Val Kilmer doesn't actually sing much; his default mode is that song-speech that Rex Harrison popularized in ""My Fair Lady."" Kilmer is best (singing and acting) in the scene with his brother the pharaoh, asking him to let his people go.  That song/scene starts off strong and he sounds pretty good.  Overall, Kilmer isn't bad, but on film you can plainly see that he is too old and too out of shape to play this part. The insurmountable problem with this show is that, with two or three exceptions, most of the music is not very good.  Then too, the author of the book doesn't know how to tell a story, doesn't have any sense of drama, draws out a good story and makes it a bit boring, and doesn't understand that theatrical economy requires that one does not start with Moses' birth.  The show wants to be like Jesus Christ Superstar, but did JC Superstar start with the Jesus' birth and grind slowly forward? No.  It began shortly before Jesus' death. JC Superstar also put the story on a human scale and the Ten Commandments doesn't do that.  It sometimes seems like it was written by a 10 year old (Moses and the Pharaoh reconcile at the end! Everybody's together! Everybody's happy!).  Other than Adam, there are some nice moments: The Pharaoh's wife (Nefertiti!) has some very nice moments, particularly after her son dies in the last plague, and Moses' adoptive mother and wife are also good.  But towards the end, it starts to seem a little silly, because the music and the book are just not written well.  But, hey, the DVD's only $6.99.  Well worth it for Adam. I bought it and am happy I did.  On the DVD are are extras: Behind the Scenes (Adam speaks!) and a lengthy Picture Gallery (slide show, really), which begins accompanied to the complete track of ""Is Anyone Listening"" and, when that's over, with snippets of other songs for the rest of the slide show.  Even in 2006, the producers knew who was the best singer in the show.",1243728000,4,2396,4.5524475524475525

2648805,5,B000HXDWIM,"I really enjoyed this musical. I had read some not so great comments so I was a little doubtful when I watched it with my daughter, but it was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed the musical score and the singing was just excellent. Val Kilmer does not have alot of range, but I thought that fact really added to the character of Moses who is deep thinking and laid back compared to his brother Rameses. I would never had thought of Moses as a way out there big singing character. It really added to the contrast between the characters of Moses and Rameses. The cast were just fantastic singers. I really enjoyed the 3 lead women and there harmonies together. Also the young lady who played Miriam. She had a really great voice and nice stage presence. Another great performance was American Idol's Adam Lambert as Joshua singing ""Is Anybody Listening"". He has a very unique sounding voice that you can actually pick out during the group singing. Guess that is why he is on his way to pop stardom on Idol. The actor who played Rameses did a great job! All in all my daughter and I thought it was a well rounded musical. You really have to like musicals to like it I think. The end song is very catchy and I liked the rock feel to the whole musical. All in all if you like musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar I think you will enjoy this one. If you are an Adam Lambert fan can't miss this.

It could have been worse, but I'm not really sure how.  I'm not sure if the choreography was really just that bad, or if the dancers couldn't pull it off.  The lyrics were laughable, and that's being kind.  There were a few decent singers, mostly the leading ladies, and fans of TVs ""American Idol"" may want to keep an eye out for season eight's Adam Lambert, who did an admarable job with the horror that he was working with.  However, I have to wonder who thought that Val Kilmer could carry a musical?  He's the lead, yet couldn't sing half as well as many of the background singers, and he certainly didn't have the voice or the skill to sing many of the (awful) songs that were written for him.  There were high points, but they were few and far between, and overall this was a disaster of biblical proportions from start to finish.",1239926400,3,1035,4.41578947368421

The plot shows the love of mothers, the cruelty of the Pharoh and how God can harden and soften other's hearts for certain things to happen. There is one song that I don't really care for and that's ""The Glory of Ra"". I just realized who that guy is! The man who plays Rmases is also Raoul from The Phantom of The Opera from 2004!

This said, even though the whole cast is amazing, my hat goes off to Adam Lambert. His ""Is Anybody Listening"" performance is stellar.

It is by far one of the best musical I have seen in my life.
The main reason is that I love the story.
Second the choice of the singers, the lyrics, the music, the sound effects all combined makes you feel like you are at the actual show.
Even more each time I see it again, I pay attention to things I had not before and things I didn't see when I was watching the live show.
The camera are showing the best scene which I missed when I was at the theatre.
What is funny is that when I heard the song ""Is anybody listening"" performed by Adam Lambert, I tought he would become a great singer and probably a star. And look who is one of the top singer of American Idol 2009? Adam of course!!! If you want to hear this song, go on YouTube and type the name of the singer + song you will find it.
It is a must see, and a must have in your dvd collection if you like good musicals.

2648824,3,B000HXDWIM,"The Good: By far and away, the standout aspect of ""The Ten Commandments: The Musical"" is the voices.  Every single female voice in the cast is absolutely spectacular.  Every time American Idol-er Adam Lambert sings you get goose bumps.  The only one in the whole cast that isn't acoustically jaw-dropping is Val Kilmer and even he's not really that bad (they wrote his part with about a 5-note range so it's pretty hard to screw up).  Everyone's very pretty for what that's worth.  I'm a huge fan of the idea of preserving musical theatre on DVD and wish there was more of a movement to do so.  I'd kill for OBC DVDs of productions like Rent, Wicked, or Mamma Mia!  Strangely, we get this short-lived, critically slammed number due to the presence of its star.  Oh well, I still applaud the preservation concept.  The camerawork is very good for a stage performance.

The Bad: Sadly, just about everything else.  There are only key smatterings of the actual Biblical story; the audience is expected to already know the details and motivations of the characters.  It's tough to pull off a musical with no dialogue and they don't do it here - you never really learn about any of the characters because they never talk.  There are no standout songs.  Not a single track is memorable and I would challenge anyone to sing more than 3 lines from the whole show an hour after seeing it.  The lyrics are never great and very often terrible and the music is a tribute to 3-chord silliness on a Casio keyboard.  The cheesy, overlaid special effects are embarrassing.  The fact that they stop the Moses story halfway through and then start singing that we should be loving, nice people is just shmaltzy.

The Unforgivable: Despite the packaging claims, this is NOT widescreen!!  It is a widescreen image letterboxed into a fullscreen presentation.  That means that on your 16:9 television it will only fill the middle parts of your screen.  This is 2009 and such terrible videography is just not okay.

The Highlight: ""Is Anybody Listening"" by Adam Lambert.  That kid's got vocal pipes (he belongs on Broadway as a centrepiece to a much better show)!  How unfortunate that it finishes 20 minutes in and nothing in the play afterwards comes close to measuring up.

The Verdict: You know, I totally get why people can't even make it through this DVD.  As musical theatre goes, it's not great.  As a DVD of musical theatre goes, it's even worse.  But I'm wild about theatre and the concept of putting it on DVD alone makes me love a DVD that preserves an original cast production.  The songs all suck, but I love hearing them because of the extraordinary vocals.  And hey, everyone's really, really pretty!  For a theatre-junkie like me, I wholeheartedly endorse buying this as an occasional indulgence.  If you're not big on musicals or theatre, then you'd probably be wise to steer clear or make it a curiosity-rental.  All-told, 2 stars out of 5 with qualifications about who should watch it.",1234656000,6,2981,4.72621359223301
2648825,3,B000HXDWIM,"First, I am a great fan and love love love recordings of stage musicals ON STAGE.  It's the closest you can get to live theatre without being there.

With that in mind, I feel horrible for the talented performers who had some dreadful lyrics to make work.  The production was 'over the top', and to the point that it was so bad it was good.  My kids (13 and 17) treated it more like a comedy.

These kinds of recordings can and *do* work... for a great example see the newly released stage recording of Camelot from 1982 (?).  That is an example of a very good production of a GREAT musical.  Unfortunately, this retelling of the 10 Commandments is neither.",1208649600,,657,4.380165289256198
2648826,5,B000HXDWIM,"I have become a huge fan of Val Kilmer's stage production of ""The Ten Commandments: The Musical"", a rock-opera performed entirely in song and dance which I have on DVD and LOVE. Val plays Moses, opposite four new favourite musicians of mine, including Lauren Kennedy playing Nefertari, Michelle Pereira playing Yokebed, Luba Mason playing Bithia, and Nita Whitaker playing Zipporah.

Also notable in the cast of this divine musical are Kevin Earley as Rameses, Alisan Porter as Miriam, Aharon Ipale as Seti, Nicholas Rodriguez as Aaron, and Adam Lambert as Joshua.

Val Kilmer sings beautifully and soulfully in this production as do the rest of the cast. I love how the whole ensemble come together at the end to sing ""A Prayer For Life"". I also love Val's ""Key To The Kingdom"", Lauren Kennedy's scorching ""Could You Do That For Me"", and Val and Lauren's tender ""A Love That Never Was"". Also awesome are Val's and Kevin Earley's magnificently forceful battle of wills played out in song (""Glory Of Ra/Let My People Go"") as well as their earlier more friendly song banter to ""When We Rule The World"" in which Lauren also performs a segment of.

More beauty comes from Nita Whitaker's soulful realisation that Val is indeed ""The One"". However, the icing on this already delectable cake comes in the form of a hauntingly beautiful song called ""Where We Belong"" performed by Nita Whitaker, Luba Mason, and Michelle Pereira. It truly is divine.

 The message of the show is all about universal love and acceptance of all types of people - it is neither overtly preachy nor disrespectful to the source material, and is very inspiring.

 Two slight criticisms. There is no real introduction to any of the characters and audiences are assumed to know who is who. Also, if you can ignore the fact that Alisan Porter (Miriam) in reality is considerably younger than Val Kilmer, and yet plays his *older* sister in the show - remember, when Val was playing Jim Morrison in ""The Doors"", Alisan had only a few years earlier played little ""Curly Sue"" in the movie by that name - you will enjoy the music and the performances.

2648827,1,B000HXDWIM,"This is a terrible show. The lyrics are childish, often repeating the same line many times in a row. The mikes curved around the actors faces are terribly distracting and more in keeping with a rock concert than a biblical musical. The sets are unattractive and boring. Val Kilmer is horribly miscast and UNattractive to the point of being unwatchable. He should NEVER have been shown without a shirt as a young Moses. He was obviously a 40 year + man! It was also obvious that by the time he got to the last song that his not so great voice was giving out.

great singer, but I am a Val Kilmer fan and even with his shortcomings as a singer, I enjoyed his performance.  I also give the production a lot of credit for their presentation as a whole. The supporting cast was excellent, and the useof projections and live action was pretty darn good, with the army coming over the mountain in projection.
