I love this movie so much!! Yes I am a fan of the Manga/Anime but for me this was perfection. Ayame Gouriki plays Shiori Gempo in order to take control of the Funtom Company and become the inheritance she takes a disguise as a guy and names herself Kiyoharu. Just so everyone knows Shiori is a descendant of Ciel. She dresses like Ciel, also her attitude is a lot like Ciel's which is one reason why I loved the movie Hiro Mizushima plays Sebastian. I feel he did him justice he seems the same as the manga with that cool as a cucumber attitude Hiro definitely was the right actor for the role.  The relationship between Shiori and Sebastian is so cute  there are a couple of funny moments Sebastian thinks Shiori is a ""Rotten Brat"" shich to me is super funny as in Volume 2 of the manga Sebastian those say Ciel is a brat. I find it around the same as in the manga. So Shiori as the queens watchdog is send to investigate a series of mummification.
also just to let everyone know this is set in the year 2020 not in 1889. Also keep in mind that it would be nearly impossible for anyone to look like an anime character.  I advice anyone to watch it with an open mind.",1469491200,,1177,4.222222222222222
