Maybe I'm being too hard on this company. I mean, they did bring a classic Hentai to America and they did leave out the annoying mosaics. But I love Japanese, slapstick overacting. This title has only an American English track with voice overs sounding like rejects from the high school drama club.
Video quality is great.
Sound is great.
Dubbing... *ugh* I would encourage this company to include two tracks for English and Japanese.
Pick it up for the slapstick comedy and the outrageous anime.",1398729600,,533,4.804347826086956
