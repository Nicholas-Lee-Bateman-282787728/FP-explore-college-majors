8060017,4,B0009FHJ32,An older (1994?) Gaither DVD with an emphasis on old style Convention singing. A little too much talk with the interviewer but the songs are just what you would expect from the Gaither stable. If you enjoy singing along with the old Convention songs you will find this a great video.,1265155200,,283,4.568627450980392
