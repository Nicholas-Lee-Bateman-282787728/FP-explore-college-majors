8658647,5,B00KH57TLG,"very good anime, with very good dubbing. still prefer the Japanese audio w/subtitles more. Wish they would have expanded on the character development a little more, especially between the main character and princess.",1442448000,,216,5.575757575757576
8658648,5,B00KH57TLG,"its really to bad they changed the starting SNDTRK to this ssn . the English dub is far better than you would expect , I just hope they won't leave us hanging to find about Izuru  and Fail Five team its a great series . if you don't have Ssn ! get it , enuff said I'm gonna spoil to much , but if you enjoyed "" Kenshii war on geminar "" I think you 'll enjoy this one too.",1440460800,,371,3.6375

8658650,2,B00KH57TLG,"My opinion on this collection is the same as what I said about the first collection. The cast didn't fit the characters, and it pained me to know I spent over $80 on this and the first bunch of Majestic Prince episodes.",1420070400,2,219,4.238095238095238
8658651,5,B00KH57TLG,"Great conclusion to the story, with possible future as well. This show strikes a good balance and maintains it through the storyline. A really great space saga right up my ally. The characters are maintained well and show growth and development. The action is well drawn and dramatic, though I could do without the deployment lead-ins being dragged out every time. If you ask me leave that stuff out and just have the show be shorter, but I guess the Japanese market needs the timing right. On the whole a great show.",1416441600,2,517,4.630434782608695
