1200978,5,B00000F2LK,"I purchased the soundtrack when this movie came out in 1984, but I never really saw the complete movie.  When it was on TV, I always seemed to catch the last half-hour.  Luckily, I was able to find a new VHS copy, and I must say it's one of my favourite movies in my collection.  It stars Lucinda Dickey as an up & coming dancer who befriends two breakdancers (Adolpho Quinones & Michael Chambers)who fight for the respect of the dance community to get break dancing taken as a serious art form.  The soundtrack is still great after all of these years, and the story is total '80s ""breakploitation"".  Even though it has been criticized for being total trash, and plagued with bad acting, just remember that this movie was the starting vehicle for all the actors involved.  I never found the acting THAT BAD.  It's a movie that will WOW you with solid jams, and hype mid-'80s fashion, plus lots of high energy breakdancing and other forms of modern dance that make the film interesting & entertaining.  I was lucky to find a new VHS copy of this movie, but it would be nice if it was available on DVD in North America.  In conclusion, if you really like '80s movies, then this one will not disappoint.",1027468800,21,1200,4.467889908256881

1201185,5,B00000F2LK,"You've heard the story before in several other movies... Street kids have a home (and or community center), big bad business guy wants to put a mall or condos on it, and the street kids have to fight to keep their space open. Mix in a love story for good measure.

Story line won't surprise you AT ALL, but it's still a fun movie and a look back at how the 80s were.  Some funny fashions that haven't yet reappeared. Some good dance moves.  Some electronic/rap music from the early days of the genre.

A fun movie!!  Definitely the best of the ""breakdance"" genre.",1299715200,,563,4.375
1201186,5,B00000F2LK,"I purchased this DVD just to see Turbo's (Michael Chambers) electro-magical, broomstick dance routine again. If you want to recreate this scene for yourself (like I do), you can download the MP3 of Kraftwerk's ""Tour de France"" from Amazon, grab a broom from the closet, and start practicing in your garage. I saw this movie when I was a kid, and my brothers and I did in fact practice in our garage. Having almost mastered some of the meat-n-potatoes moves, we even entered a few break dancing competitions. I don't recall receiving any trophies, but I still have an aching back to show for my hours of working on ""the helicopter""--a fairly acrobatic move that requires strength, balance, flexibility, and lots of shoulder bruising to master.
Look for a young and goofy looking Jean Claude Van Damme who appears as an uncredited extra in the beach scene where Special K (Lucinda Dickey) meets Turbo and Ozone (Adolfo Quinones). Seeing this movie so many years later, I think it plays really well as a comedy but not necessarily in the way it was originally intended. The fashions, the lingo, and much of the dancing are ridiculous enough to be funny. And Ice-T's roses-are-red-violets-are-blue style of rapping wouldn't be good enough for Saturday morning cartoons these days, but it's a priceless snatch from the time capsule that is Breakin'. I give this movie a 5-star rating simply because it's a fun moonwalk down memory lane.",1295308800,,1431,4.893004115226337
1201187,5,B00000F2LK,"Okay, ya, I know...It's a total 80s blast from the past now considered ""an oldie"" but I LOVE THIS MOVIE! No, the acting isn't Oscar worthy, but the dancing still keeps me glued to the set.  My only complaint with this DVD is that a huge chunk of the love story part of the movie is cut from the DVD. I have no idea why but it is missing.  You go from Ozone and Kelly talking on the beach to the dance stdio where they kiss and as far as you knew they were still just friends.  So, there is a good 10 minutes missing. Oh well.  No matter, still worth watching.",1292976000,,559,3.9642857142857144

I love how happy this movie makes me feel whenever I watch it.  Sure the acting is not Oscar worthy but it doesn't need to be because it's about the dancing and the music and both are great!

Dancers today have no clue about droplocking or krunking. Everybody needs to revisit this movie and get back to what real dancing is. Shabba Doo and Boogaloo Shrimp got the moves that'll knock the socks off you. This is dancing people for reals.

And the music? This soundtrack is dynomite! The movie theme ""There's no Stoppin us"" was worthy of but denied any Grammy or Acadamey awards. This song was and still is my motivation to not only get me through the day, but to strive for and achieve all my dreams. And just like the beutiful leading lady Lucinda, I will never give up. And who can sit through 'Body Work' and not want to bust a move? And just when you thought it was over the top as is, here comes Ice T, yes THE Ice T with his masterpiece 'Reckless'.

The dancing, the costumes, the attitude, and the soul stirring drama is all here and even better than I remember it seeing it seven times in the theater. Breakin' and the Sequel 'Electric Boogaloo' are never in their cases for long. I watch them at least twice a week and every Saturday morning. All hail Breakin!",1208736000,4,1331,4.514522821576763

1201310,5,B00000F2LK,"I remember going to Smiths, with my mom as a child, and renting this movie at least three times a week. I couldn't get enough of it. I would watch this movie with such enthusiasm, that I can't even remember what else I would do as a child, besides riding my bike and going to school. I would try my best to practice the moves  in the movie, and work on my locking and popping skills. But then the Smiths store in our town closed, and I eventually forgot about Breakin', slowly it slipped from my mind.

But even now, as I remember the movie, most of the dance moves and hip-hop music is just as awesome and addicting as it was when i was a kid.
It is true, that the plot is lacking and corny...
but this movie is about passion for dancing! Plus the music is seriously the best part of the movie. (except for the lame music in the dance studio near beginning of the movie.)

The dancing try's to make up for the questionable acting and story line. The not so great story and acting is actually good for a laugh, making the movie worth while as an unintentional comedy. This movie serves it's purpose as entertaining and enjoyable to watch, that is, if you enjoy marveling at  break dancer's grooving to rad music. I will always love this movie, even if some might not agree with me, it is indeed, worth a watch.

UPDATE: 7 June 2007, I just watched Breakin' and I still love it just as much as i did then. Some of the parts were a little cheezy, but it really didn't matter, I also have rekindled my love for Ozone. YAY!

UPDATE: 18 June 2007, I have now watched it with a group of friends and we laughed and made fun of the cheezy parts, but also enjoyed and wowed the dancing, and sometimes, funny dancing scenes. This movie is still one of my favorites, in the category of crazy 80's movies. YAY!

UPDATE: 15 September 2007,
I thought about erasing most of my first review of this movie. But I didn't. Because it's fun to watch the progression of this change in me. I still love the movie because it has sentimental value, but truthfully, this movie is only for a laugh. And really, there aren't that many good dance moves, which makes me sad and I wonder why I liked this movie as a kid so much. Maybe i was just in love with Ozone? quite possibly.

However, i still will give this silly movie five stars out of respect for it and Adolfo Quinones is the most awesomely dressed person in this movie. The style and 80's clothing of this movie is down right perfect for what I hope the 80's really looked like. I don't know if i'd suggest buying this movie, unless you have sentimental value with it, but you at least need to rent it or watch it somehow.

1201385,5,B00000F2LK,"I am going to count down the ten greatest films of all time with my own special trademark touch. It's going to make you laugh, make you cry and make you question the very being of certain lifeforms. In the words of the great Leroy Burrell, Let's get it started.

I start with the number 10 movie of all time because I'm going to have you on the edge of your seat by the time I get to number one. It's hard to sum up a movie where some of the finest acting, dancing and music hit the big screen in one big brushstroke, but slap me in the twins if that didn't happen here. Breakin is a phenomenal journey into the edgy world of breakdancing posses. This movie hits close to home for me as I grew up in the urban jungle known as Millard. I was a natural as a breakdancer which should come as no surprise. With my Winston Churchillesque leadership skills, I formed a breakdancing group called Smallmouth Bass and the V cuts. We pretty much owned the breakdance circuit in the Nebraska, Iowa, Louisiana region. I'll never forget this one time Burns got a call from Slidell Louisiana from Jabs and his group, Cajun Cardboard, and they called us out. We both got into our breakin vans and threw down right on I-40 in Ft. Smith Arkansas. There are books still being written about that epic battle. We embarrassed cajun cardboard with an assault of windmills, centipedes and Frothy Slobber. I was impressed with the skillz of Jabs and we invited him to join our crew. When he accepted, a breakdance dynasty that was similiar to UCLA basketball under John Woody was born.

This movie has breakdancing just a notch below what happened in Ft. Smith. Turbo and Boogaloo Shrimpboat probably could have been on our second string, but for the general public that is really good entertainment. You aren't going to see us live, so putting these second rate breakers on the big screen certainly isn't a bad idea. If you do want to see us live, bring your visa card, because we don't break on command and we don't take american express.

I am breakdance king and you are someone that can't do the running man.",1135123200,4,2089,4.449086161879896

1201387,5,B00000F2LK,"Attention 80s babies! Breakin is the quintessential 80s movie. You've got bad hair, bad clothes, and bad acting (and when I say bad, I don't mean good). But what it does have is incredible dancing by the likes of Lucinda Dickey, Shabba Doo, and Boogaloo Shrimp (with street names like that they better have some hot moves or they'd be a joke!).

  What makes this movie so special is that the poor acting doesn't even matter. The characters are so lovable and talented that you focus on seeing them succeed. This movie captured the beginings of the cutting edge hip hop revolution with great energy and style that was just sweet and cheesy enough to not scare suburban America.",1125619200,2,677,4.6722689075630255
1201388,3,B00000F2LK,"Jean-Claude Van Damme trying to shake his groove thang in a spandex onesie at the beach...

That is reason enough to buy the damn thing right there.

I admit, when I saw this at age 13 I thought ""Breakin'"" was the coolest thing since Star Wars.  I never had anywhere *near* the athleticism for true breakdancing/floorwork, but my moonwalk and robot weren't too bad.  Flash forward to 2005 - I'm a married goth with a penchant for film scores.  I find both ""Breakin'"" AND ""Breakin' 2"" on DVD.  I braved the eye-rolls and head-shaking to reclaim this piece of my youth.

Don't sweat the storyline.  (Three dancers find their groove in challenging the snobs.)  The film isn't called ""Highlights from The Lee Strasberg Institute"".  The movie's reach matches its grasp; some scenes feature moves and routines that make your jaw drop.  Michael Chambers during Kraftwerk's ""Tour de France"".  Adolfo Quinones and Bruno Falcon during the first Radiotron duel.  Lucinda Dickey during ""99 1/2"".

Sadly, it seems the distributors like the films about as much as my wife does.  Weren't there even bloopers?  Even Adolfo Quinones couldn't deliver a line like ""I think I hear yo' mama calling you!"" with such intensity right out of the gate.  C'mon.

Try the Spanish overdub option.  If you don't wet your pants, you've got the TV on mute.

Frankly, I think the three leads should reunite and revive the storyline in a different setting - say, Renaissance France...

WALTZIN': ELECTRIC MINUET!

Just watch the movie, and giggle at how much you dug that part of the 1980's.  Hindsight is 20/20, after all.",1113264000,17,1589,4.847014925373134
1201389,1,B00000F2LK,"A second movie came out in 1984 to easily snatch Beat Street's briefly held crown for worst hip hop movie.  Breakin' is so Hollywood it's set in Los Angeles, with only a few good dance performances thrown in to save it.  It has far more plot than Wild Style or Beat Street, but that plot is PG fluff revolving around a young White female jazz dancer (Lucinda Dickey as Kelly) who learns about ""street dancing"" and then claims it as her own.  Her teachers, real-life stars Adolfo ""Shabba Doo"" Quinones and Michael ""Boogaloo Shrimp"" Chambers, are indeed talented dancers, but in the West Coast styles known as poppin' and lockin', not breakin'.  These three characters form a crew in which they do very little break-dancing, suggesting that the title was a cheap marketing ploy to capitalize on the popularity of real b-boys.

 The dialogue is cheesy and written for children (absolutely no swearing or sex), with a sugar-sweet message about working hard and showing the rich dance snobs what you've got.  Although Kelly refers to their moves as ""street dancing"", she sees very little actual street, unless you count a clean, peaceful Venice Beach boardwalk.  The only rap music in the entire movie is during two scenes at the Radiotron club, which strangely feature future-Gangsta Ice-T with feel-good lyrics about achieving your dreams.

 Their goals realized, the new crew stars in their own Broadway show, ""Street Jazz"".  This performance, like much of the rest of the movie, is choreographed jazz and modern dance with wack costumes by someone who has probably never been to the Bronx.  It too exploits hip hop, and in the process gets it all wrong. Finally, the movie ends with no resolution of the love triangle that has been a major focus of the plot, but promises that Breakin' 2 is coming soon.",1103155200,4,1802,4.833876221498372

By the way, did anyone who has seen this recently recognize that one of the people standing and watching the street dancers near the beginning of the movie was Jean Claude Van Damme!

There is really no sense in trying to explain the plot line to this movie, mainly because it only takes up about 20 minutes of this 86-minute movie. The rest of the movie involves the characters dancing (mostly break dancing to be exact). To be honest, the story actually gets in the way of the dancing (never thought I would say that about a movie).

Okay, if the story line isn't worth talking about and the acting is pretty much non-existent, then why the 4-star rating? Because of the dancing. This is one of those movies where the story and the acting don't really matter. For those of us with no dance talent, these dance moves will leave your mouth wide open.

the movie is more about freedom, respect and recognition than anything else. for us street dwellers who were heckled and stared down by most ""normal"" people, this movie is our anthem. it tells us that no matter what you do, so long you put your heart and soul in to it, you'll bound to make it. this was our outlet, our ticket to say that, ""hey were as normal as you are guys"". we just happen to like breakin', lockin' and poppin'!
the broom dance sequence of TURBO alone is well worth every cent you'll spend. the secret in enjoying this movie is to never expect anything grandiose. just take it as it is.

(Including Re-Run). Shabadoo's father invented the dance style. I find it highly unlikely ""Re-Run"" (who is brilliant) would win anything against him.
The movie is full of classic dancers from boogaloo shrimp (turbo) to poppin' taco (who is responsible for most of Michael Jackson's moves) and Poppin Pete. This is a lighter version of what breakin' culture was at the time, but it was hot. The dancin' was real, the West Coast answer to Break dancin. It was around the same time as Beat Street (which actually was NOT as good on the dancing side, but better on the overall appeal of the Hip Hop culture from emceein' to bombin' to djin' to breakin) but Breakin' totally creatin' an image. No one was poppin' as hard as turbo, taco or pete. No one was lockin' on the level of Ozone. Lot as much actual floor work, but this movie for poppers and lockers (called strutters back in those days in some circles) is the best out there.

I was 10 when I first saw this movie in San Gabriel, CA., and I remember how I used to challenge kids my age (girls and boys)to break. At the end, there were no losers (most of the time everyone danced together) and it didn't involved social status, race, origin, etc, what mattered most was how well you could break. If I tried any of the floor moves I used to do, I would need a paramedic on my side just in case. I've encountered several people who would rather not remember those days, but what I can say is that if in a movie theater you had people getting out of their seats to dance and break to the beats while the movie was playing, there had to be something magical to it. I cannot say less but recommend this movie to everyone, and hopefully you will recover those lost memories just like I have.",1053388800,12,984,4.23936170212766
1201451,3,B00000F2LK,"One thing that needs to be pointed out about this movie is that it really isn't about Breakin,or Breakdancing. Both of the lead dancers actually specialized in two different styles seperate from Breakdancing(windmills,headspins,floor work etc).
 Shabadoo is a Locker,his style of dancing is called Locking. Shrimp is a Popper,his style of dancing is Popping. Both of these styles originated in California and was developed by dancers who danced to 70's & 80's Funk music,different from the breakbeats Breakdancing developed from. Both of these styles developed independent from Breakdancing that came from New York.
Even though there was some actual Breaking in the movie, people should be aware of the style differences of the two lead dancers and of other styles. The term Breakdancing which again came from NYC, became an inaccurate umbrella term for all urban dance styles in the early 80's. This is why I feel that the name of the movie should have been something else to reflect the West Coast dance styles that both Shabadoo and Shrimp were doing.",1047340800,5,1054,5.127906976744186
1201452,5,B00000F2LK,"This was the movie that set it off for Popping (the type of robotic dancing performed by Shrimp) across the country. Being a popper from back in those days, I was given some major tools when I watched this movie. Watching Shrimp dance legitimized what we were doing in the streets as art all it's own...a dance form that startedin was elevated from, but never left the Streets.
The movie is fantastic. The acting is appropriate for the subject matter. If you're looking for Oscar award winning entertainment, go see a Denzel movie. If you're looking for str8 up entertainment, then peep this one.
Shrimp's scene with the broom is off the chain. Ginuwine did pretty well in his copy during one of his music vids...but there's nothing like the original...besides........I'll BURN Ginuwine!!  ;^) (LOL)",1035158400,3,799,4.9185185185185185

The highlight for me is Michael ""Boogaloo Shrimp"" (Turbo) Chambers' skill. The scene where he dances with a broom is outstanding, magical and a very good display of body control. Ginuwine, who is an incredible dancer in his own right, actually copied Chambers' scene in one of his recent videos. Anyway Michael Jackson brought us some unbelievable displays of dancing talent but I think Chambers is the best dancer I've ever seen.
The lines from Breakin' are cheesy, don't watch it for scenerio, watch it for the dance scenes, the music is also great and from a long gone era. Adolfo ""Shabbo Doo"" (Ozon) Quinones also showed some mad skillz , as did their main competitor in the movie, Bruno ""Pop N' Taco"" Falcon.
