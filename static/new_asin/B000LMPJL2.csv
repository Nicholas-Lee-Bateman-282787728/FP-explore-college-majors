But Govinda and his dancing and his smile won out and it was worth the view. A little heavy handed in the message, but Bollywood does that.
We have a son who's greed for money has him rejecting his honest father and his views of life. The son marries the daughter of the honest father's worst enemy. They become estranged. Then the son has his own son. The grandparents become close to the grandson The grandson comes to prefer his grandparents over his parents and so are thrown out into the cold cruel world to fend for themselves and the child is told his grandparents are dead.
20 years later the child is all grown up and finds out his grandparents are still alive and decides to teach his parents a lesson.",1305763200,,856,4.3229813664596275
