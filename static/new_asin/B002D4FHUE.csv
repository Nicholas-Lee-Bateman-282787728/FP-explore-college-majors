8364820,5,B002D4FHUE,"I love ""Don Gato y su pandilla"" but the DVD I bought from seller ""moviesonsale1"" was defective.  I bought the English version ""Top Cat"" from  a different seller and it is great,  plus you can view it in Spanish too!

If you are going to buy ""Don Gato y su pandilla,"" make sure you buy it from a reliable seller.  I accidentally removed the feedback I had left about seller ""moviesonsale1"" and can no longer post feedback, but if I could, I would give the seller ""moviesonsale1"" a 1 star (negative review) because the DVD was defective, plus I sent the seller an email on july 27 and it is now august 5 and have not heard back from the seller.

But ""Don Gato y su pandilla"" is an excellent TV show, my kids love it.",1312156800,,714,4.213235294117647
