849958,5,6304368534,"'The Adventures of Merlin Jones' has been available for years on DVD, but they have overlooked this funny sequel time and time again. It just doesn't make sense and the way Disney regurgitates their movies every couple of years, I figured this was bound to come out sooner or later! It's bad enough that a lot of there older films get horrible ""pan & Scan"" releases, but I'll take it anyway they want to do it at this point. I would hope it's not a ""PC"" issue!.....aargghhhh! :-( Please release the DVD!",1215475200,3,503,4.478260869565218
849959,5,6304368534,"""The Monkey's Uncle."" is really funny and enjoyable and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves disney films and comedy.  Annette and Tommy Kirk are great in it, really a funny and sweet couple.  The monkey is like their adopted child. They have lots of adventures and misadventures.  It's great for the entire family.",1114128000,3,315,4.796296296296297
849960,5,6304368534,"""The Monkey's Uncle"" is an entertaining and funny sequel to ""The Misadventures of Merlin Jones."" Set again at Midvale College, it is better than the first. This time Merlin Jones the student genius, played again by Walt Disney's stalwart Tommy Kirk, gets involved with sleep experiments with his pet chimpanzee and a bicycle-propelled flying machine. Jones's girlfriend again played by Annette Funicello still vies romantically for his attentions, as he still remains fixated with his goofy scientific experiments. Leon Ames returns as Judge Hornsby. One great highlight of this film is the title song ""The Monkey's Uncle"" written from the genius of Walt Disney's reliable Sherman Brothers. It is performed by The Beach Boys and Annette Funicello on screen behind the credits. This film and its predecessor seem like such minor efforts but they were the two films that attracted my daughter's attention and got her interested for more of Walt Disney's live action films. I wish they would put a lot of these old Walt Disney movies back in print because my daughter and a bunch of her friends really liked them. At that time I went out on quest and bought up every Walt Disney live action film I could get my hands on. I love these films and I still watch them. When I say that I recommend something from Disney I mean it.",972604800,21,1321,4.823788546255507

850089,4,6304368534,"Midvale College genius Merlin Jones (Tommy Kirk) is back and so is his girlfriend Jennifer (Annette Funicello).  Once again penned by blacklisted writers Alfred Lewis Levitt and Helen Levitt, this outing involves two attempts by a disgruntled regent to abolish football from Midvale College.  In the first half of this faux film, the tyrant uses failing grades as an excuse to get rid of the football team.  The judge from the first film (Leon Ames), asks Jones to find an ""honest way to cheat.""  Jones uses `sleep-learning' on the two dumbest members of the team.  They each earn perfect scores on their latest test convincing the teacher that they cheated.  The last half of this movie involves another scheme by this same disgruntled regent.  This time he has a donor willing to give the college one million dollars if they will abolish football.  The judge gets his own donor (Arthur O'Connell) willing to give the college millions if they can build a man-powered flying machine.  Jones reluctantly accepts the challenge with humorous results.  (It should be noted that Stanley the monkey isn't featured in this film to any great extent other than for Jones to be given guardianship of him.  And as an excuse for Annette and The Beach Boys to sing the title song.)

This money making sequel was made in spite of the fact that Walt Disney fired Tommy Kirk after completion of the first film when it had been revealed to Walt that Kirk was gay.  Kirk was reluctantly invited back to the studio to make this profitable sequel.  (Apparently, avarice superseded Walt's standards of 'decency.')

This was the last film Annette Funicello and Tommy Kirk made for Disney Studio.",1422748800,,1673,4.862190812720848

850091,2,6304368534,"Not enough Annette! Sure, she stars in it, but there is too much of the monkey, and his uncle. My family and I totally fell asleep during it. If you're wanting this because you're an Annette fan, don't waste the time because she isn't in it enough. A shame!",1418774400,,257,4.26530612244898
850092,3,6304368534,My biggest complaint with Disney releases is that they still think that the people who love these films still have an old cathode ray tube television set with the 4:3 aspect ratio. Why don't they release them in the original theatrical ratio typically 1.66 to 1 or 1.85 to 1??? This is a conundrum that I suppose Disney does not care to address.,1418428800,,345,4.492063492063492

Went in for the first showing of the day and went home four showings later. Nothing exceptional about the film, no academy worthy acting, no incredible special effects but just a heck of a lot of fun for a 10 year old. Still a lot of fun today.",1391990400,,475,4.173913043478261

There were a lot of great actors who adjusted well to the corny plot.  I wasn't embarrassed to watch it with my two year old grandson.  Young people won't care for this, but Boomers will smile.

850261,4,6304368534,"Great movie.  I loved it as a kid and i love it now.  I think being marketed under ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" may have caused some of the movie to be cut, but it's still a keeper.",1386115200,,184,3.8157894736842106
850262,3,6304368534,"The movie was worth renting just to enjoy seeing Annette and Tommy Kirk.  Sadly, it was Tommy Kirk's last Disney film, and it is just a silly comedy.  I always enjoy Kirk's dramatic roles better than the goofy comedies.  Add to this the Beach Boys seeing with Annette on a Sherman Brothers Theme song, and you've got an okay, but not great Disney film.",1379462400,2,352,4.46875

850320,4,6304368534,Two solid episodes of 'The Monkey's Uncle'. You can't go wrong. The best part is that you can leave the DVD on the main menu for hours and it repeats the theme song.,1326585600,,165,4.03030303030303
