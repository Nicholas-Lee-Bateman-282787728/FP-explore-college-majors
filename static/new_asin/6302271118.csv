This was an excellent movie in my opinion, it has action, adventure and Marc Singer still does a great job of playing Dar. Of all 3 Beast Master movies, number 1 & 2 are my favorites by far, but all of them are worth watching if you like these types of sword and sorcery movies, I just don't under stand why the companies that own the rights don't release these on DVD it is beyond me. This would make a great 3 pack series to buy; I noticed on Youtube.com that there are Extras like a news clip on the making of the second movie and the original trailer, so have fun watching yours truly Anx.

445501,5,6302271118,"It just plain baffles me how a movie like Masters of the Universe exists on DVD and Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time does not. The plot for Beastmaster 2 is almost the same as Masters of the Universe with a very big difference. IT IS A MILLION TIMES BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!! That being said, clearly an inferior film earns the right to be on DVD but a superior film does not? Come on people!!! Get with the program and release this sucker already!!! The 1st Beastmaster film is on DVD. HECK, CONAN THE DESTROYER IS ON DVD!!! Beastmaster 2 is WAY BETTER then that. WHAT GIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1191369600,13,590,4.5754716981132075
445502,3,6302271118,"IN THIS 1991 FOLLOW-UP TO THE 1982 CULT CLASSIC, AN EVIL SORCERER NAMED ARKLON [WINGS HAUSER], WHO HAPPENS TO BE DAR'S LONG LOST BROTHER, TEAMS UP WITH A WITCH [SARAH DOUGLAS] TO TRAVEL TO MODERN-DAY L.A. WITH A PLAN TO GET A NEUTRON DETONATOR THAT WILL BLOW UP THE WORLD AND DAR [MARC SINGER] MUST STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. A LITTLE SILLY AT TIMES, BUT THIS SEQUEL IS OK. IT SURE DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S GOOD IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR ANOTHER LOOK AT THE BEASTMASTER. ONLY ONE QUESTION; WILL THIS ONE EVER BE ON DVD?!!!!",1059523200,16,544,4.3431372549019605
445503,3,6302271118,"This movie is fantastic. The only problem I have with this VHS Cassette is that they recorded it using Extended Play (EP). That means they sacrificed picture quality to fit the movie on less video tape. It's a very [poor] trick. If you plan to buy this movie (which, again is great !!!) please wait for the DVD because this VHS version has poor picture quality.",1015113600,7,361,4.484848484848484

445505,5,6302271118,"This video is awesome! I loved it! This girl accidentally travels back in time, where she meets Dar, the Beastmaster. They both think each other is strange but than later think each other are cool. Arklon finds out about  the Portal and tries to take over the world. You should see it, it's the  best!",960336000,4,301,4.454545454545454

7823261,5,6302271118,"Not the best movie, but added to the excellent original on dvd. Arrived on time, as described.",1483574400,,94,4.588235294117647
7823262,4,6302271118,This is a fun movie that doesn't exactly take up where the first one left unfortunately Tanya Roberts is not in this one. This one deals not only with time travel but also a little more in the realm of magic. It have moments of humor without making the whole movie a comedy the very ending is really stupid (bronze age Pilgrims journey to worship a car in the dessert with the radio blaring) other then that it is a pretty good movie if nothing else it does have two beautiful babes playing in it.,1481673600,,497,4.242105263157895
7823263,4,6302271118,"This movie is wild and fits so oddly as a sequel to the first movie. The ferret that dies in the first movie is just randomly back, the tiger isn't painted black anymore (probably because the black paint killed the one from the first movie, r.i.p. little guy) and the title conflicts with the plot completely. Having said that, I am a sucker from cheesy schlock like this and have a soft spot in my heart for the inevitable fish out of water story so popular to 80's franchise movies. For what this movie is going for it's not a half bad time.",1470528000,2,543,4.281553398058253
7823264,5,6302271118,"There's zero time travel in this movie and it's colon titled a portal through time. Yep, Beastmaster 2: A Portal Through Time has zero time travel. It also has basically nothing to do with the earlier way more adult oriented, which is more like 14 year old boy wanting to look at Tanya Roberts oriented, film to a wacky family friendly film complete with self referential humor. Beastmaster 2: A Portal Through Time plays in movie theaters in the movie cause hippie humor is in effect. They also have a wizard that picks a fight with an over the top homosexual stereotype, the tactical error of fighting Beastmaster at the zoo his natural habitat, Kari Werher looking and acting convincingly like a teenager despite being way older, and most importantly Wings Hauser being absolutely awesome. Basically, I enjoy the film and Wings Hauser growing a tarantula out of his mouth while stealing an army jeep is kinda great.

One of the writing credits here it Ken Hauser, I got the sneaking suspicion that Wings was writing his own stuff here. It feels distinctly Wings in a way only his personal projects do. It's a unique sense of humor that's somewhere between threatening and screwball silliness. Wings is the must unsung wild man talent in film",1462492800,,1244,4.786046511627907
7823265,5,6302271118,I did not know that there was a second Beastmaster movie.  I was great in its cheesy way.,1406160000,,89,3.9444444444444446
7823266,5,6302271118,"I was hoping for this to come out on dvd, but finding this VHS version from Amazon will do until then. This sequel to Beastmaster is different in where it leads, away from the real world of Dars. It ends up in a more recent time of cars and cds. Here Dar and his brother do battle over a nuclear device to be used to conquer the beastmasters world with the help of one young woman played by Kari Wurher. Of course there is a witch who provided the doorway into our world  played by Sarah Douglas.",1344211200,,496,4.11340206185567
7823267,2,6302271118,"Marc Singer and Sarah Douglas are the high points of this film.  Marc Singer is, of course, the Beastmaster.  His acting and action scenes are up to par.  Sarah Douglas is the witch/sorceress, and her talent and charm are obvious.  Even Wings Hauser as the big bad guy has his moments, so all is not lost.

However, the script is full of bad 80s slang.  Characters make decisions that do not make any logical sense.  One early section of dialgue is so bad that I had to stop the tape.  And the music is bad 80s hair-rock.

Beastmaster 2 is similar to Highlander 2.  The second movie of each series is almost unrelated to the original movie.  The basic concepts are present in each sequel, but they go horribly astray.

All of that aside, Beastmaster 2 has some good moments.  Beastmaster 3 brings the series back on track, but that is a different movie . . .",1311552000,2,858,4.388535031847134
7823268,1,6302271118,"This has nothing to do with the first film. Even the opening crawl note doesn't know what's going on. What chance do we have? The idea of having The Beast Master travel to modren times is goofy as the Ready To Rumble film,gimmicky as WCW in 2000 and cartoony as Pokemon. The fight scences are half-done and played for mostly laughs. Even WCW had better fighting during it's dying days. The ""Chill out,Lord Dude"" is the dumbest line in the film. The black tiger is not in this film and replaced with a stripe one. The continuity is all over the place. Kari Wuhrer who is best known for her role as Maggie Beckett in Sliders is a cliche spoil brat and not subtle at all. The 2 good thing in this film are Sarah Douglas who is best known for her role as Ursa in the first 2 Superman films and James Avery who is best known for his as Philip Banks from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The dress designer is the most cliche gay guy ever and even more then the other one from Beverly Hills Cop. The Villian is dumb mainly for letting the girl get away. The car gag is not funny and done to death. The worst part is that the gang drives pass a movie theater that shows Beastmaster 2. THAT MAKES NO SENSE!!! It's like Ash Ketchum reading the graphic novel of Pokemon The Movie 2000 while being in the movie itself. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1303171200,2,1335,4.158301158301159
7823269,4,6302271118,"I found them! I found both of the sequels on DVD by googling ""Beastmaster 2 on DVD"" and found a rare DVD dealer who has both of them at a reasonable price. Don't despair, true fans! They can be found!",1266105600,6,200,4.025
