2762062,3,B000NA21SG,"Cedric the Entertainer, Lucy Liu and Nicolette Sheridan have all seen better platforms, whether it's movies or TV shows that play to their strengths.  This is a short comedy about a janitor who thinks he's a secret agent.  The viewer is always one (if not two or three) steps ahead of Cedric in figuring out who is stacked up against him.  It's not a total waste of time or talent, but probably not a movie you'll see twice.",1183766400,4,424,4.410256410256411
2762063,1,B000NA21SG,"i have always dug cedric the Entertainer,but his films are usually pretty run of the mill. Cedric is a Good Comedian,but  He gets stuck in 3rd rate type of films that often aside from a few catchy punch lines and phrases or something  are almost done as soon as the film starts.  this film is another in a line of his films where the story-line wasn't that much to begin with and I lost interest early on. the chicks in this Film were banging,but the film itself I say just skip beyond a couple of parts.",1180137600,2,504,4.229166666666667
2762064,2,B000NA21SG,"Ever since Cedric the Entertainer burst upon the scene with his critically acclaimed, scene-stealing performance  in the original ""Barbershop,"" no filmmaker has quite figured out how best to harness the considerable talents of this longtime stand-up comic.  In the years since that film was released, C the E has appeared in one monumental turkey after another, with his latest endeavor, ""Code Name: The Cleaner,"" marking what we can only hope will be a professional low point before he begins his gradual ascent back towards some degree of cinematic respectability.

In what is clearly one of the lamest, dopiest and most ill-conceived spy comedies in movie history, Cedric plays an amnesia victim who wakes up in a hotel room next to a dead FBI agent and a suitcase stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Unsure of who he is - the possibilities range all the way from an undercover spy to a local janitor - or how he managed to get himself into such a predicament, the mystery man, Jake, is soon on the run from unknown forces out to nab him and the valuable computer chip it is believed he has in his possession.

This is such a perfectly ridiculous piece of celluloid-wasting cinema that it is scarcely worth the time it takes to watch, let alone comment on, the movie.  Suffice it to say that Cedric needs to start looking into getting himself a better agent, while his co-stars - like Lucy Liu, whose career is clearly in as much trouble as Cedric's - should begin deleting this film from their professional resumes as quickly as is humanly possible.",1179878400,,1565,4.756457564575646
2762065,3,B000NA21SG,"...Thanks to the star, Cedric the Entertainer.  In this humorous little tale, Ced wakes up next to a white man that he shortly discovers is an FBI agent.  Next comes a white woman claiming to be his wife (played by Nicolette Sheridan)...but our favorite janitor soon finds out that she is not who she professes to be...and that he is in possession of a mysterious disc that is sought after by many different security factions of the US government..with some being more unscrupulous than others.  With the help of a waitress/pseudo-girlfriend/undercover FBI agent played by Lucy Liu, our boy Ced finds the disc and brings the bad guys to justice.  Since Cedric is one of only two actual entertainers in this movie (the other is fellow janitor and aspiring rapper DeRay Davis), it only gets 3 stars.  Lucy Liu and Nicolette Sheridan both return lackluster performances.

Good for an evening's entertainment...but certainly not an award winner.

2762068,3,B000NA21SG,"You have to be a strong fan of comedy to buy it, but it is well worth a rental. Good acting, story, action, and effects. A black man has amnesia and wakes up next to a dead FBI agent and a quarter of a million dollars. He must figure out who he is, how the agent was killed, and what to do with the money. His flashbacks lead him to believe he is some type of special forces agent, but his waitress girlfriend tells him he is a janitor. Good adult entertainment.",1178064000,5,462,4.032608695652174
2762069,5,B000NA21SG,"Cedric the Entertainer is one of the funniest men working in movies today.

This is an average-to-below average story; it's been done before in so many ways, but Cedric manages to make it feel fresh and new.  Even Better - this is easily one of the funniest movies you will see this year.

Cedric, a master of humor,  manages to be funny on so many levels.  He can be subtle, with deceptively simple wordplay and simple glances.  A raised eyebrow, at the right time is much funnier than a poorly played pratfall.  Forutnately, Cedric is also a genius at physical comedy, as well.  If the clog dance and the spanking scene were not proof enough, the sequences of him trying to be Arnold as the commando should prove it beyond any doubt.

Cedric allows his fellow comedians their moment to shine as well.  Although this was clearly a 'star vehicle' for him, he generously gives great opportunities to his co-stars to show their comedic chops.

Get this movie - it will pick you up when you're down.  Look, it's not meant to be a 'deep movie.'  It's meant to be a lot of laughs.  The world is a rough place.  We have enough Serious.  We need Funny.  We don't need depressing stuff.  We need entertainment.

Cedric is exactly what he says he is - THE Entertainer.",1177027200,2,1259,4.491150442477876
2762070,1,B000NA21SG,Pathetic The Entertainer is proof that you cant fix stupid. The movie about an average guy who thinks he is a spy is so stupid its shameful. There is probably one scene where he does this funny dance and thats it. The rest of this movie is chittlin circuit comedy at its worst. Pathetic the Entertainer is about as funny as the psychos who defend this clown with blind fanaticism. He is a comic not an icon so get a hold of yourselves and see this minstrel clown for the punk sellout he is and not the role model you want him to be!

2762165,1,B000NA21SG,This movie should be erased from existence.  All mention of it needs to be wiped from the human consciousness.  There is not one redeeming quality to it.  Cedric the less-than-entertaining is so comidically bad that you might think you'd like to see this train wreck just to witness his lack of talent.  You'd be wrong.  It would be better to deliberately mash your fingers in a drawer repeatedly while slamming your face into the desk top than to see this movie.,1213315200,3,463,4.666666666666667

The fat fellow in the end brains the bad FBI agent with a bucket.

Vin Diesel has changed our perception of what an 'agent'

2762169,4,B000NA21SG,"Cedric was awesome in this family movie.  It's about a man who has memory problems.  I don't understand why so many people think the movie was unfunny.  Here are some of the highlights:

- Cedric uppercutting a man with a bucket during a fight scene
- Cedric waking up and not sure where he was, or who he was sleeping with.  He turned over and it was a dead guy!
- A man sliding into a glass door, and the glass shattering
- Cedric putting skittles in his butlers mouth.  The look on the guys face was priceless!
- Also, the butler neatly placing the skittles in a glass jar in an attempt to make them look fancy was a nice bonus touch.
- During a car ride scene, a bad man who was laying on the roof went flying into a bunch of parked cars when the driver suddenly put the brakes on.
- One of Cedric's friends in a bathroom bending over and a janitor coming in and seeing something he shouldn't have seen, lol
- When Cedric was playing golf, and the golf ball bounced back and nearly hit the butler in the mouth.  He ducked just in time!
- Cedric escaping from his fake wife and falling out the window of the big home.  Ouch!

The movie had plenty of other funny moments as well.  Cedric will always be the master of comedy, baby.",1195257600,4,1232,4.138655462184874
2762170,3,B000NA21SG,"Here is a cute, if predictabel movie.  Cedric the entertainer plays pretty much the same character he has played in just about every film he has ever been in.  Nicolette Sheridan plays a role that reminds me of Sharon Stone in Total Recall.  Lucy Liu plays a character who is easy to figure out right from the first appearance she makes in the movie.  Still, this is a decent way to spend an hour and a half.  The performances are pretty good and the plot is done in total fun. Cedric plays Jake who wakes up with amnesia and a situation.  Is he a killer?  Is he a rich man of the world with a beautiful blonde wife?  Is he a secret agent or is he...?  And what about his beautiful blonde wife?  And is that waitress more than meets the eye?  And what about the Holland dance troupe...What role do they have in this intrigue?
