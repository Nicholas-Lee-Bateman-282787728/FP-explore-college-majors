7850709,4,6303575609,"This is another video in Cory Everson's Basic Sculpting Series, this one targets the back, biceps and abs.  Cory is joined by Stephanie and Bob, and all three start out warming up, on various machines.  During this time Cory talks about the workout and what's ahead, you can warmup during this time by marching in place or use another warmup.

You work your back first, most of these exercises are doable at home, Stephanie and Bob demonstrate a lot of these on machines that are either found in a fitness spa or weightlifting gym, Cory demonstrates some on machines as well, others using simple equipment found at home.  Seeing all these machines can deter one from using this workout, but it is doable for those with minimal equipment.

The exercises included in this workout are:

lat pulldowns/chin ups also an option
long row
bent over row (barbell or dumbells)
one arm row
bicep curls
dumbell curls (alternating arms)
concentration curls
abdominal crunches
oblique twists

I had to modify some of the back exercises, I used a resistance band for the long row, I wrapped it around my feet and did it that way.  For the lat pulldowns I just did bent over rows in place of it, as I couldn't find another modification.

For the bicep exercises, Cory does 3 sets of 12 reps each, one more than her normal 2 sets of 12, so the biceps really get worked well.  She says that it's hard to build the biceps so she opted to throw in an extra set.

There isn't much for ab work, only 2 exercises, and 2 sets of 25 reps each.  I think another one or two exercises could have been added, maybe in place of one of the harder to modify back exercises.

Overall, it's still a good video and I will give it four stars.  Cory does a nice job instructing as always, she provides a laid back, light approach to weightlifting, which I like.  I really wish she would release this series on DVD, it has become one of my favorites.",1237593600,,1912,4.454022988505747
7850710,4,6303575609,"This is one of two videos in Cory's Basic Sculpting Series that focuses on upper body.  Chest, Shoulders and Triceps are worked and worked well I might add.  Cory is joined by Beth and Mike in this video, Beth showing the exercises on machines found in fitness spas, Mike showing them on machines found in weightlifting gyms, and Cory demonstrates them using home equipment.

There is no formal warmup, Cory is shown marching in place, while Beth and Mike are warming up on other pieces of equipment, such as a bike and a treadmill.  Cory explains about the workout during this warmup, which lasts about 5 minutes.  I either march in place along with her or warm up to another video.

Then it's on to the workout, you will do 2 sets of 12 reps of the following exercises:

pushups
bench presses
incline bench presses
chest flies (done on an incline)
military presses
lateral raises
front raises
bent over raises/rear deltoids
pushdowns/lying tricep extensions
tricep kickbacks
french presses

Some of these exercises use a bench, but you can do the workout without one.  I think the selection of exercises is good, and the muscle groups are covered well.

I like Cory's teaching style, she is very laid back and down to earth.  She really seems to know her stuff and I find her information throughout the workout useful. She is a former Ms. Olympia after all.

The workout setting is plain but clean, it's a room with gray carpet and plants, the music is nothing special, instrumental keyboard.  I don't find that it interferes with the workout at all, it suits it fine.  The clothing is a little dated, lots of bright colors but not too bad.

I think this is a good workout, I like upper body work more than lower, and I am hopeful that rotating these 3 tapes in the series will really shape me up.  I like the fact that they are short and to the point, plus I can add a short cardio on before or afterwards.  I think if I were to do each tape twice a week I would see some nice results.

Overall, a solid 4 and a half stars.  I wish Cory would make an updated set of these workouts.  They are among my favorites.",1237593600,,2114,4.455729166666667
7850711,1,6303575609,"There are hundreds of fitness video targeting for thighs, butt, stomach but I couldn't find any tapes tagaretting on arms and chests. So I decided to order this tape from amazon at once.
I was very exciting when I received it so I immediately put it in my machine, then after 5 mins of gabbling(her accent is annoying btw), the actual workout still has not begun. Then I realised some of the exercises required a bench but it hasn't been mentioned on the tape cover. Worst is, the whole workout is only 35 mins long, so I was left with less than 10 mins for each exercises group after all the ""introduction"". I wouldn't hv complained if the exercises are effective and/or if Cory has brought in something new, but these are just standard exercises that u can easily find in a fashion magazine(note: not even fitness magazine)

7850712,2,6303575609,"I was disappointed with this tape.  More than half of the exercises require a bench, which was not specified in the tape description when I purchased it.  I did the whole workout, simply lying on the floor whenever Cory used the bench, but I did not feel that I got very much out of it.  The triceps workouts were good (and do not require a bench), but if that is all you're looking for, I recommend trying something else.  Also, the tape claims to be from 1995, but it looks more like it was produced in 1985.  This tape is for people with a home gym or for those who go to a gym to workout.",1030579200,,592,4.068965517241379
7850713,2,6303575609,"I bought this video but ended up returning it.  It's not for a home workout but more a gym tutorial.  Plus it is not done in Cory's normal style. Sorry Cory...  If you are looking for some really good tapes by Cory, I highly recommend these three:  Cory Everson Get Hard - Arms and Shoulders; Cory Everson Get Hard - Abdominals and Glutes; Cory Everson's Total Workout.  I use these three tapes weekly and am sore after each workout.",1028937600,,433,4.430379746835443
7850714,4,6303575609,"The only reason this video didn't get 5 stars is the pull-up bar exercise that most home exercisers don't have.  Other than that, it's really good.  Cory does 3 or 4 exercises for each body part, with 2 sets of 12 reps each.  Regarding the review above, there is no need to pause the tape and do more  reps because you are supposed to choose a heavy enough weight that you will  not be able to do more than 12 reps.  However, if you felt ambitious and  wanted to do a third set you would need to pause (but I doubt you'll have  the energy).  The entire sculpting series is excellent- her chest,  shoulders, and triceps being the best.",947030400,15,634,4.2521008403361344
7850715,4,6303575609,This tape really works specified areas. Cory only does 2-3 sets so you must pause the tape and do your own. Great tape to get started but exercise great for everyone. There is one exercise you do need a pull up bar for  which I just to something else. Overall great work out.,928713600,3,275,4.188679245283019
