7796516,5,1565855957,"This is a college-level course. Kenneth Harl is an absolute  master of his subject much like John Julius Norwich.  His lectures move rapidly along so much so that you may have to hit the pause button to make your notes. He is engaging, accurate, and thought provoking.  Do make sure that you secure the little study guide that accompanies the DVD series if you purchase as used.  Also don't forget to look up Harl's previously published books.",1449619200,,443,4.714285714285714

7796518,4,1565855957,Byzantine history has been a mystery to most of us.  It is a period of the Roman empire that few seem to explore.  Dr. Harl has remedied that with this wonderful course covering the times leading up to Constantine's conversion to the fall of Constantinople to the Othman.  It consists of 24 lectures organized chronologically but still drawing out the threads of culture that made the eastern empire.  Dr. Harl's lectures are clear and thought-provoking.  It is a pleasure and not a chore to listen and learn from his teaching.,1160352000,17,527,4.811111111111111
