8200079,3,B000REIKO2,"A very melancholy study of a woman who values love above all but can't seem to actually live with it. This is another period piece from Dreyer but does not have the impact of his other major films. Dreyer was an old man and only lived several years after this film was completed. This was clearly not the work of a young optimistic man. The actors deliver most of their lines in scenes together at oblique angles, not directly facing one another. This might be psychologically true for these characters but adds another layer of disconnection for the viewer.",1397952000,,558,4.646464646464646
8200080,5,B000REIKO2,"A talented, brilliant and sensitive woman leaves her husband, a prominent and successful figure in the eve of his designation as Minister, by a younger man, a renowned pianist, whose composition - a Nocturne - whose somber character would seem to depict him more than words can make it. But this is a bad choice and so she will embark on a series of unsatisfied love affairs, just to realize herself the true happiness lies within.

This masterpiece from 1963, is the swan's song for this genius of the cinema, revealing before us with his admirable and refined style extremely austere but worthy to admire over and over again. His traveling, the tender handle of camera, the intimacy of the involved characters, the magnificent landscapes and a first-rate cast as well as the solid density of the script, makes me to pronounce myself for this gem of movie as one of the most sublime works of that decade, and obviously one of the supreme jewels of cinema.",1184544000,8,956,4.724550898203593
