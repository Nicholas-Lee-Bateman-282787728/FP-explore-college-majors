6925353,4,B00RC16SCO,"An interesting example of German Television's portrayal of the law enforcement culture.
Some real-life aspects of the former East German ethos are sometimes apparent or implied.

6925357,4,B00RC16SCO,slow but entertaining! Interesting to see how Germans resolve murders without too much violence. Not recommended for war and torture lovers.,1462406400,3,140,5.714285714285714

6925370,5,B00RC16SCO,I really enjoy this show. It does not strive to be a serious police procedural but keeps up a quick plot pace.  It has the touch of humor that older crime dramas were able to employ so deftly. (Quincy or Jessica Fletcher for example) I certainly hope there is a second season.,1460419200,2,276,4.3076923076923075
6925371,5,B00RC16SCO,"Good criminal investigation series with an often amusing relationship between the two police detectives.  Marie Brand is more observant than most, which helps her solve murders.  In addition, she has some unusual skills such as being able to write with both hands simultaneously, though it's not terribly believable that she would be able to submit handwritten reports in this day and age.  However, these abilities help gain the trust of her new partner. My only problem is the sometimes odd subtitles.  I bought the DVDs in order for my mother to see the show on her big screen TV.  We both speak German, and translating greetings as ""Howdy"" or ""Mom's the word"" show that the show was translated for an American audience, but by someone who didn't really know modern American English.  I hope the translation is better for the next set.",1458172800,2,838,4.866197183098592
6925372,2,B00RC16SCO,"Zero chemistry between leads, lead actress is all over the place with her character why is a woman who is clearly in her sixties trying to be hip with the high-heeled wedges and too-long jeans?  If I'm to believe she is so intuitive why on earth is she so impractically dressed?  What robbery/homicide officer wears high-heeled wedges to a crime scene or in pursuit of a suspect?--this could just be a product of bad writing--very bad, very cheesy writing at that...Really glad I only purchased one episode to get a feel for it...",1457222400,,530,4.688172043010753
6925373,5,B00RC16SCO,Good fun!,1456876800,,9,4.0
6925374,4,B00RC16SCO,Quite good.  I've seen this on television here in Austria so it was not completely new to me.  Not sure it's worth purchasing but is very enjoyable.,1456617600,,148,4.444444444444445
6925375,4,B00RC16SCO,This is not a gripping who done it. It is character driven. It is on the light side. The main character Marie is very likable. More like Colombo or Angela Landsberry than a European cop show.,1456617600,3,191,4.333333333333333
6925376,3,B00RC16SCO,"Not much chemistry between main two characters. Plots are OK, but lack of chemistry leaves you kinda flat most of the time.",1456531200,2,123,4.636363636363637
6925377,2,B00RC16SCO,"This series is very weak compared to other German police procedurals like Bukow & Konig and Anatomy of Evil.  The stories are predictable and superficial. The writing is marginal.  The characters are assemblies of surface traits and stereotypes instead of having interior lives and conflicting emotions.  There is nothing contradictory about these characters.  At the end they are exactly the same as they are at the beginning.

This series is a disappointment.  The bar for drama was set high by the previously mentioned shows, which Marie's Mind for Murder doesn't
come close to.",1456272000,,581,5.193548387096774
6925378,5,B00RC16SCO,This is a great TV series from Germany! Thoroughly enjoyed every episode! Wish there were more! Please note that this is spoken in German with English subtitles.,1455926400,,161,5.0

Excellent mysteries that keep one guessing with many twists and turns that are easy to follow with some surprising endings.

6925401,5,B00RC16SCO,Really liked it. Good stories. Humour. Sorry there were not more episodes.,1449187200,,74,5.25
6925402,5,B00RC16SCO,"Very much enjoyed the show. They have added the other episodes since my last review so that is good. These shows are on par with many of the English detective shows like Midsummer and George Gently. My only problem with these are the English subtitles. I speak enough German to catch that they are not always correct, The issue is not severe enough to change the meaning of the show but is annoying when I know that is not what was said.",1447459200,10,437,4.341463414634147
6925403,2,B00RC16SCO,A little slow moving for me - I usually like this type of show - probably the writing is the problem,1447200000,,100,3.8095238095238093
6925404,5,B00RC16SCO,Unique stories.  The two main characters are interesting to watch in action.  I thoroughly enjoyed all of the episodes.,1446508800,,119,5.2105263157894735
6925405,4,B00RC16SCO,"This agreeable German import features the odd pairing of a married, middle-aged female detective, who had transferred out of serious crimes and a 30ish, self-described lothario, pursuing bad guys in Cologne. Inspector Marie Brand brings an exceptionally sharp mind, diamond bright observations skills and a left brain-right brain interaction that correlates the most obscure data into a pattern while being able to simultaneously write with her left and right hands. This freaks out her co-workers. She accepts that she is 50ish but her winning smile and appealing manner make her popular with her co-workers. He, on the other hand, is Inspector Jurgen Simmel, a street-smart, former vice cop. He knows that he is not a bright as his partner; nor is he quite the ladies man that he envisions himself. He does bring a physicality to his police work -- he has at least one chase scene in every episode; while she just lets him run. They address each other formally but there is obviously respect. Each 90 minute episode has an 1980's cop show vibe with likeable leads, up-tempo stories, touches of humor, and unique Cologne scenery that can be both modern and sleazy. The stories are less gory than most crime dramas nor mean-spirited like Law and Order episodes. There is little nudity and almost no swearing. Every episode stands on its own and backstory is unobtrusive. Some stories are more intricately plotted than many crime dramas. Marie's Mind for Murder consistently held my interest and I plan on purchasing the second set when it becomes available.",1445472000,13,1557,5.015444015444015
6925406,5,B00RC16SCO,Marie's partner is always getting in to funny situations. I hope there is a second season coming!!,1441324800,,98,4.823529411764706
6925407,5,B00RC16SCO,Good thing for the subtitles - the stories are really great!  Enjoy it tremendously.,1439424000,,84,5.0
6925408,5,B00RC16SCO,Great!! Thanks.,1436227200,,15,7.0
6925409,1,B00RC16SCO,"and that is not really a good thing. One of the main characters, the 36-year-old male detective played by Hinnerk Schonemann, is depicted as an extremely dumb, clueless jock simpleton. He says and does things only a 10-year-old would do and makes a fool of himself, ridiculed by his boss, colleagues and anybody he interviews, frivolously damages forensic evidences, gets duped and toyed by young female suspects every time. Apparently some people find this funny but I have no idea how, unless you think crude slapstick in crime dramas is the greatest thing. Schonemann often plays goofy characters, but this one is asinine and not funny at all.

Marie's character has no depth either. She is a great riddle solver with super-human memory and all, but that is about it. There is no inner moral conflict within Marie, or any other characters for that matter, so even though some episodes center around social issues like power abuses and medical ethics, the whole thing feels very shallow. It is a little weird because the premises and characters of some episodes feel complex and layered at first, but the directors/writers are just not up to it, like a teenager preaching what life is, and they all end up very superficial and one-dimensional.
Marie's divorce side story is just as shallow with no development. They were a happy mature couple until one episode where the husband allegedly falls madly in love with someone else out of the blue and immediately leaves her. Marie gets over it right away, so maybe that was all the marriage they had.

If you are looking for Scooby Doo played by German actors this may be it, but if you are looking for a gritty crime/human drama, you have to go with ""Bukow & Konig"" or ""Cenk Batu"" also available from the same publisher, or you will be thoroughly disappointed.",1435622400,3,1809,4.794871794871795
6925410,5,B00RC16SCO,I really enjoy this series.  The captions fade away as you begin to watch. The entertainment of seeing Germany and hearing Germany is an added bonus.,1433721600,2,149,4.730769230769231
6925411,5,B00RC16SCO,"This series is absolutely satisfying! It is phenomenal in its detail. Marie is amazing, and the rapport between her and her colleague, Herr Simmel, is heartwarming.

6925415,4,B00RC16SCO,"Excellent plots but weak character development in the beginning. Didn't quite create the tension between main characters that was expected and that tension that was there dissolved quickly. The male lead ended but being a caricature instead of a character, almost the classic comic relief found in early films (Charlie Chan comes to mind) against the mature, highly qualified female lead. Both played well against US stereotypes of German efficiency.",1430956800,3,450,5.442857142857143

6925426,3,B00RC16SCO,"It must be really popular to have the women in some of these murder mysteries dress like they are going out to do the gardening. Sloppy.
The show is ok and would get a higher rating from me if the male counterpart wasn't such an idiot most of the time. Maybe it will improve but I'm not holding my breath.  Give her a new partner with common sense and dress her better!",1424217600,2,369,4.125
