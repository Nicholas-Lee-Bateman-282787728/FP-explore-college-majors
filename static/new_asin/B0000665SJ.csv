1711552,5,B0000665SJ,"This is a high quality release for b-western fans and John Wayne collectors. The three mesquiteers ( a serial form the thirties and forties with various actors as the mesquiteers ) are played by young John Wayne, Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan and Max Terhune. They are going to find out who is behind some cattle rustling. Nothing new in the plot but what a high speed and action ... never a dull moment. And, oh, those wonderful fast riding scenes with traveling camera. Lorna Gray ( aka Adrian Booth ) is beautiful and then Polly Moran is doing something rarely seen namely real funny female clowning. Some of the last action scenes seems to be from an older film and that seems quite unnecessary but luckily it's only for a few seconds. The cover on the box is misleading. It shows John Wayne as he appears in the much later Red River by Howard Hawks. It' s a dirty trick and may confuse customers.",1358899200,,892,4.478527607361963
1711553,5,B0000665SJ,Another one of the Mesquiteers series.  I enjoy all of the 8 he made.  The music in his 8 films is the best of all that were made.  Makes me feel young.  Glad they finally put these films on DVD.,1357689600,,195,3.8
1711554,5,B0000665SJ,"Olive Films has licensed a number of early John Wayne B Westerns, originally Republic releases. This one is from a good print, enjoyable, and recommended to any fan of early Westerns.",1356307200,,183,4.935483870967742
1711555,5,B0000665SJ,"I can say that I am a John Wayne fan. This is one of his best. I am quite a fan of his movie ""The Searchers"" which is my favorite with that said Red River is right up there to the top also. I have watched it many times. The Duke and the other cast are great. Enjoy!!",1351900800,,266,3.603448275862069
1711556,4,B0000665SJ,I just received this and the other three new BR discs from the John Wayne Three Mesquiteers era. The Amazon.com review of the story almost takes longer to read than the movie is long. I'm just kidding but its a 56 minute film as they all are and I surmise the reason they are on separate discs and so expensive is because the market is small. On all films the picture quality is sharp and stunning at times and the sound is robust. These are fun films and its a hoot to see young Duke riding a big white horse with his oversized white hat. Some of the horse chase scenes in all the films is really stirring as the camera is just ahead of the horses and to see them charging at full speed in HD is pretty cool. These are sort of silly/stupid scripts and sadly Duke Wayne isn't the main star...he is co starring so he's not on camera as much as I'd like but I am a fan and am glad I picked them up. This will be my review for all four films as they were all made within a couple year period all directed by the same man and all pretty enjoyable with their own quirkiness. I just wanted to let folks know that they are a quality presentation and the covers are retro cool with original graphics also displayed on the BR disc itself.,1349827200,10,1229,4.1037344398340245

Our story line and plot, Our heroes Stony Brooke (John Wayne), Tucson Smith (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan) and Lullaby Joslin (Max Terhune) members of the Three Mesquiteers which finds the boys working as government agents to stop some cattle rustling --- the meatpacking industry has hired its own agent, Tex Reilly (Kirby Grant), to get a line on the rustling --- That in itself was an interesting aspect of this oater, the inflation of meat prices as a result of cattle rustling --- One never does think of the economic hurt, those rustlers cause --- Kirby's cover is blown before he can infiltrate and folks in the Red River country already know the Mesquiteers are coming --- So Wayne and Grant switch places and Wayne poses as an escaped killer --- The focus of the investigation is a dude ranch where some mighty strange goings on are occurring --- Can't reveal what the scheme is, but I assure viewers it's a lulu --- Lorna Gray, aka Adrian Booth, is the heroine, while raucuous comedy relief is provided by old-timer Mrs Maxwell played by Polly Moran.

John Wayne ...  Stony Brooke

Special footnote -- The 32 year old John Wayne was fortunate enough to have talented writers around him to write novels that could be adapted into vehicles for his career, as well as short stories and screenplays that would immortalise him as the American hero --- This film is one such example --- When you watch this film you're not watching it for the story (like you would do in 'Rio Grande' or 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'), you're watching it to see John Wayne in action --- He is the romantic embodiment of what it was like for the settling community to live in the post-civil war era --- Despite the fact that most of these westerns distort history, what Wayne delivers gives you access to his humanity --- That's what we like about him.

However, I question where they got their print from.  It was VERY disappointing to see a superimposed ""revival"" on the title card for a few seconds.  It seems that with the film quality looking so good, that the superimposed word could have been removed with today's tech or replaced the credits from another print.  I will not purchase any others until I can confirm that the other features do not have this problem.",1370044800,,544,4.635416666666667
