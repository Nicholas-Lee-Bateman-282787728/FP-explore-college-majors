3767802,4,B001QOGY6I,"Take the Mission Impossible franchise and replace the MI team with cute, fuzzy, and very small animals. Somehow, it works. The CGI critters blend seamlessly with the live actors and scenes, making it incredibly easy to suspend disbelief.

As with any good kids' movie, there's enough wit to keep the paying grown-up amused. The ""you can if you try"" message comes across as heavy handed at one point and a plot reversal seems abrupt, but those things seem minor. It's a cute popcorn movie for the kids.

3767803,3,B001QOGY6I,"If you're over the age of ten, you're officially too old for ""G-Force.""  This is an innocent, non-threatening action and special effects extravaganza. It's not meant to inspire, educate, enlighten, or encourage; it's mindless escapism for the little ones, and nothing more. Knowing this, I find myself in a strange situation, torn between recognizing the entertainment value and the reality that it's the cinematic equivalent of empty calories. From my world-weary adult's perspective, I watched this movie caring not a bit for the characters or the story, and I kept wondering why no one considered the idea that even kids can enjoy something more stimulating. I can't think of any part of the brain this movie stimulates, except, maybe, for the visual areas easily distracted by eye candy. The tagline says it all: ""Gadgets, gizmos, guinea pigs. In 3-D.""

Simple, honest, and direct. To be sure, there are a lot of cool visuals, and the fact that certain theaters are showing the film in 3-D is sure to be alluring for some kids. The technical work that went into this movie is extraordinary. It was, after all, directed by Hoyt Yeatman, who started in the film industry in visual effects departments. It was also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, whose supervision of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy, the ""National Treasure"" films, ""Armageddon,"" and ""The Rock"" proves that he has an affinity for action and special effects. What is he trying to say with ""G-Force""? That within all of us is a child who likes gadgets, gizmos, and guinea pigs all in the same story?

The premise is light-hearted, if completely uninspired. A technical expert named Ben (Zach Galifianakis) has trained three guinea pigs, a mole, and a fly to be secret agents. The guinea pigs are Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell), Juarez (voiced by Penlope Cruz), and Blaster (voiced by Tracy Morgan). The mole is Speckles (voiced by an unrecognizable Nicholas Cage). The fly is Mooch, who serves mostly as surveillance. They're all equipped with tiny electronic devices you're not supposed to question the plausibility of, such as night-vision goggles, PDAs, handheld blowtorches, parachutes, laptops, and earpieces for communication. Hoping to impress the FBI and become their own special task force, they're assigned to infiltrate the home of a powerful billionaire named Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy), who plots to take over the world with his line of household appliances.

Joining the adventure at one point or another are a flatulent guinea pig named Hurley (voiced by Jon Favreau) and a temperamental hamster named Bucky (voiced by Steve Buscemi). Hurley clings to Darwin like someone in desperate need of a friend and is always hungry. There's a reason for this, but I don't think it matters one way or the other.

At a certain point, Blaster decides to call his team G-Force, although he never says what the G stands for. Is it safe to assume that it means Guinea Pig? No, that would be GP-Force. Anyway, as they attempt to stop Saber, they're pursued by an FBI team led by Agent Kip Killian (Will Arnet), who feels that talking guinea pigs will compromise their own mission to stop Saber. This eventually leads to a frenetic chase sequence involving squad cars and highly mechanized plastic hamster balls; they zoom around the street of Los Angeles until they go right through an active fireworks display. In the annals of movie car chase sequences, I tend to doubt that any audience member, child or adult, sat in the theater and thought, ""This would be so much better with fireworks!""

I won't say any more about the general plot, except that the final act could have gone by the title ""Transformers, Jr."" Needless to say, that's when the special effects really let loose. It's all in good fun, I guess, although I have a feeling that some will leave the theater with ringing ears and a headache. What's the point of assault the senses when an interesting story isn't even being told? How entertaining can it be if we can't even care about what's happening? There I go again, thinking like an adult.

I beg you, please no comments that this is just a kid's movie, that I should lighten up, that not every movie is meant to be deep and meaningful. I've already admitted that it wasn't made for grownups. I'm sure the little ones will find it very entertaining in spite of the fact that it did absolutely nothing for me. It's an action adventure that keeps it clean, not just with the lack of violence and language but also with the belief in goodness and redemption. The closest this movie gets to a suggestive moment is a shot of Juarez shaking herself dry after emerging from a pool. Oh, you sexy guinea pig! No wonder the film couldn't get away with a G rating. I will not say that I disliked ""G-Force"" because dislike implies that I actually felt something. I watched it in an apathetic daze. Intellectually, I understood that it was made purely for entertainment. Emotionally, I continue to hope that some children prefer more fulfilling ways to spend a day at the movies.",1248739200,2,5055,4.836994219653179
3767804,3,B001QOGY6I,"My opinion:  Not terrible and not great.  The plot was a bit ridiculous, although there was a huge twist at the end which I didn't expect.  It was annoying to see how the movie was spliced up and things were put out of order to make the trailer seem more interesting.  I think this is a fun movie for kids.",1248739200,,306,4.05
3767805,4,B001QOGY6I,"It is my prediction--but what do I know?--that ""G-Force"" will NOT win an Oscar for Best Picture. It may not even pack 'em in the theaters the way ""Cars"" did. What it will do is entertain children--AND adults--and even teach a lesson or two.

It is a summer ritual that I take my great-nieces (2) and -nephew to see a movie at the theater. We all chose ""G-Force"" because of television ads.  Prior to going, Carolina (age 5) went up to everyone she knew and quoted--with great voice intonation and perfect facial expressions--this line from the movie: ""You put a bow on me, you lose a finger!"" After we saw the movie Carolina added the second line: ""You put a dress on me and you lose the whole hand!""

It won't be a bad spoiler, will it, if I say that not only does this character get a bow and a dress, but she gets lipstick as well! That's the final insult, but Juarez (the character), must play along to win her freedom.

And that's one vital point of the plot: Win their freedom. They've been sold as pets! Blaster and Juarez, guinea pigs--make that scientifically and genetically altered guinea pigs--are actually government agents trained by Ben (a human) to use sophisticated weapons to obtain secrets for the government. In short, they are spies with special talents.

Although the plot is fun and perhaps a little scary for wee ones (not my 5-year-old Carolina), the older crowd (5 and older) seemed to really enjoy the movie. Obviously, the humor is meant for all ages because I heard myself laughing--out loud (I'm grandparent age)! Even Carolina kept whispering, ""This is awesome!""

Of course, Colby (the 9-year-old) loved Blaster. He always loves the ""goofy"" ones (because he considers himself a ""goofy"" one). Tracy Morgan wonderfully delivers this voice--and sometimes steals the scene. The main character, Darwin, the capable leader, is narrated by Sam Rockwell, and is deliberate, yet carefully heroic.

In fact, I was sure Nicholas Cage voices Darwin, but no, Nick plays the mole, the brilliant technology character. Who would have thought it?

But the real surprise is Juarez, voiced by Penelope Cruz! Juarez was my particular favorite, who plays the keep-'em-guessing governmental agent with exactly the right tempo--a little mild flirting, but focused  concentration on the job at hand. It is this character with the ""lose a finger"" line. Delivered perfectly! Juarez is totally delightful!

However, the best thing about ""G-Force"" is the message. Bottom line: Everyone is special. Everyone has talents. It sometimes takes a skilled person to instill that self-confidence and bring out those talents. The scientist Sam is the one in the film. In ""ordinary"" life (there is much talk of being ordinary), it is often teachers who bring out these talents. It was a good lesson.

One neg about the movie: The poster accompanying this review is a very weak choice for advertisement (that little blue one next to the reviews). When the picture is small, the front guinea pig (Darwin) looks like an elephant or perhaps a Jewish man from the Old Testament. I know the poster depicts a brave scene, but I suggest replacing it with one of color that shows the courage and derring-do of these wonderful guinea pigs.

Note: Parents, please don't buy your child a guinea pig just because they are so cute in this film. Animal activists are worried about this. You know, the-bunny-and-chicks-at-Easter syndrome.)

You might also rethink your kitchen appliances! If you ask why, you might lose a finger...or a hand...or worse!",1248480000,27,3528,4.91919191919192

You have no one to blame but yourself. But this movie is aimed at kids and, unlike so many current animated features that also try to throw some story worth toward the adults, G-Force doesnt. The writers/ director tries to shoe-horn in a moral for the kiddies (its not your origin that makes you special, its what you can and willing to do) but its unnecessary amongst all of the fluff and hair. Do know that in spite of there being a plethora of talking animals this isn't a musical! I don't know whether that helps or hurts the film but I don't think it really matters. My daughter, who has a collection of Zhu Zhu hamsters, surprisingly didn't care for the movie. The voice casting did kinda suck with Penelope Cruz being bland, Tracy Morgan just coming off as stupid, and other voice actors being hemmed in by a pretty straight script that didn't take any chances. Only Steve Buscemi as a put-upon hamster that is too big for his britches comes off decently. This is certainly not a repeat viewer. 2.75 lackluster stars.",1512345600,,1174,4.516431924882629

the plot

The FBI is secretly training animals and even insects to go undercover and crack tough cases that the human G-Men are just too noticeable to remain covert.  FBI scientist Ben has figured out a way for humans and rodents, flies, cockroaches and more can communicate.  He then trained a special group of three guinea pigs to use tiny instruments to infiltrate computer files, a mole who's specialty is computers themselves, and even a fly that keeps a ""fly's-eye view"" from above for the unit on the ground.  The G-Force is made up of Darwin, Blaster, Juarez and Speckles.

Meanwhile, an evil home appliance distributor, Leonard Saber, wishes to destroy mankind.  Three guinea pigs and a mole are unofficially sent in to crack the case from computer files at the Saber mansion.  The mission was a success, or so it seemed.  It seems that the head guinea pig, Darwin may have accidentally downloaded the wrong file.  But now before they could fix this situation, superior FBI officer Kip Killian shuts down the funding for this animal research unit and while the G-Force was trying to avoid the FBI agents, while they were running away from them, they get trapped inside a pet store.

Now the G-Force unit need to find a way to escape from the pet store, while also avoiding the FBI agents and also don't forget that they need to save the world from Saber Enterprises.  Will these super-intelligent rodents be able to save the world while still keeping under the radar of the FBI, and the pet storeowners?  Find out when you go and see Disney's latest 3D adventure

the breakdown

Admittedly, when I first saw the preview for this film during the trailers at the beginning of UP, I knew that this was a movie that I was going to avoid, as I did for Beverly Hill Chihuahua.  But, as my seven year-old son and I are trying to fill our day in Orlando, FL while my wife is off at her convention - my son offered the idea for a movie.  I'm happy he dragged me up the street to the theater and he had me shell out an extra $3 for the 3D version.  Disney's G-Force is a wonderful family movie filled with plenty of humor, and an exciting plot that forces you to cheer on the members of G-Force.

The cast remained obscure behind the animation for the most part.  For example, I had no idea that it was the voice of Nick Cage (Ghost Rider, Next) behind the voice of Speckles the mole.  And despite the fact that Juarez the guinea pig was female and had a Latin accent, I was surprised that it was in fact Penlope Cruz who supplied a Mel Blanc, fake kind of Mexican accent for her character.  On the other hand, Steve Buscemi's voice in unmistakable in his role of guinea pig/ferret character Bucky.  And Tracey Morgan, who dished out just about all of the laughs as Blaster the rowdy guinea pig, was also obvious.  His humor was derived of stereotypical black-character one-liners.  I had even forgot about my abhorrent stance against Morgan's past politics on staying high or drunk for as long as he can.

The characters were all likeable, even the fly named Mooch who doesn't speak at all.  Juarez, the ""sexy"" female guinea pig seems to be playfully toying with the hearts of Darwin and especially Blaster who has a major crush on Juarez.  They didn't get into that too much as it was kind of annoying and unnecessary, but at the same time it gave the flat computer image characters more body to them.  The plot was kind of easy to predict, but I really don't expect it to be too complicated, after all it is an animated Disney movie.  I think that the twist at the end of the movie will surprise the kids viewing the film.  I was very impressed with the 3D effects, which were much better than its predecessor Pixar's UP.  I'll be one of the first in line to buy the blu-ray when it appears on the shelves maybe around this Christmas season.  Maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to judge this as boring without seeing it yet, but it teaches me a lesson too.  Now I guess I should go and rent that Beverly Hill Chihuahua movie.

Not a great movie, not a classic, but it has some interesting and likeable characters (especially Juarez) and some sweet moments and several funny moments.  Not at the top of my list, but entertaining.  Recently, it was on sale on Amazon, and I figured, why not?  I could see myself watching it again sometime in the future.

3768182,4,B001QOGY6I,"Make way for the guinea pigs!  Darwin (Sam Rockwell), Blaster (Tracy Morgan), and Juarez (Penelope Cruz), plus their computer expert Speckles (Nicolas Cage), a star-nosed mole, and their eye-in-the-sky, Mooch (Dee Bradley Baker), a housefly, are G-Force, a very special team of agents trying to earn accreditation by the FBI.  They were assembled and trained by human Ben (Zach Galifianakis), who was clever enough to realize that animals do talkto each other, in their own languagesand, with his assistant Marcie (Kelli Garner), was able to create a computer program that converted their sounds to English, plus a dazzling arsenal of miniaturized equipment for them.  Obviously, tiny rodents are much less likely to be noticed sneaking into buildings than humans are, and Ben has high hopes that a forthcoming Bureau inspection will not only renew his funding but legitimize his guys.  In quest of this, he sends the team into the headquarters of home-appliance mogul Saber (Bill Nighy), whos been under investigation by the Bureau for the last couple of years.  And in the secret inner circuits of the company computer they find something that looks to them like a program for world domination.  But when the Bureau team arrives, it not only rebukes Ben for an unauthorized search, it cuts off his funding and orders him closed down.  At first the team is threatened with becoming literal guinea pigs, but they manage to sneak aboard a nearby delivery truck and join the stock of a pet shop, where they meet the overweight Hurley (Jon Favreau), a food-loving guinea pig, Bucky (Steve Buscemi), a hamster whos thought to be part ferret, and a trio of tuneful mice (Hoyt Yeatman IV, Max Favreau).

Desperate to get back to Ben and try once again to prove their worth, the guinea pigs get separated from one another, and Speckles is thought dead.  But once on the loose, Darwin discovers something very sinister about Saber appliancesthey actually come to life, and with obvious belligerent intent.  With bare hours remaining until the sinister program activates, the team must find a way to recover their equipment and, pursued by the FBI, get into the corporate computer to insert a virus that will bring the whole thing down.  This delightful and fast-moving take on spy/caper movies features an engaging trio of heroes, rapid-paced action, wonderful gadgetry, and a great twist at the end.",1442016000,,2392,5.030379746835443

I used to work at a pet store so I am already pretty familiar with compatable animals for his age, in case he goes astray and picks an animal that would not be good for his age.  Long story short, he decided on a guinea pig (perfect choice) so when he finally got one after months of researching for Christmas he was so thrilled.  He was borderline obsessed with guinea pig facts so I thought for fun I would pick up this DVD for him on Amazon (I paid $7.50 or so for it).  Great choice!  My 9 year old loves this movie and thinks it is so fun to watch when he takes out his guinea pig to play every day.  The movie is fun and entertaining for both adults and children.

3768537,4,B001QOGY6I,"I guess I've been taking Nicolas Cage for granted all these decades.  I remember all those adoring Movieline articles about this ""real actor"" but I just didn't think he was particularly awesome but I think he's channeling some of his earlier roles in this performance and he is AMAZING as a vole.  Just fantastic and I don't even notice Bill Nighy's performance unfortunately.

This movie reminds me of that DC Comic Tales of the Unexpected story about the two alien manufacturers who cornered the autor industry a la Japan and Germany limiting the choices of the citizens until theirs were the only cars on the road and then kablooey!

G-Force is echoed in the recent revelations about the Toyota blackboxes which the company refuses to share with American law enforcement but the data is buzzed back to Japan and now for sale to other Japanese companies, the Sony Playstation hack of their account holders blamed on external menace, the Russian usb drives in the souvenir pens at a recent international summmit and Russia's response/attempt to divert attention away from themselves with the claim that Chinese have embedded wifi chips in household appliances (pretty much everything I've purchased from Amazon in the last several years!)  Also in today's news, they've found a way to hack into our subway fare cards - not as invasive as the fact that Hong Kong's Octopus cards can be used for complimentary bill payments at Japanese branded convenience stores all over the former colony.

As with any good kids' movie, there's enough wit to keep the paying grown-up amused. The ""you can if you try"" message comes across as heavy handed at one point and a plot reversal seems abrupt, but those things seem minor. It's a cute popcorn movie for the kids.

3768655,4,B001QOGY6I,"Really, really funny! The basic premise is funny enough, but what they do with it is really grand. G-Force is a team of special agents consisting of three guinea pigs and a mole. Make that four guinea pigs, as they pick one up in a pet store along the way.

Ben and Marcy are the humans who trained them, and apparently developed their highly specialized equipment, but the story really belongs to Darwin, Blaster, Juarez and Speckles, and their tag-along Hurley. The action is terribly fast-paced, sometimes too much so for me, and amazingly inventive.

Saber (Bill Nighy) is the head of a multinational appliance company that has imbedded communication chips into every one of its appliances, and plans to turn them all into a global spy ring in an operation with a code name I can't remember.

This is a totally high-tech movie, with lots of 3-D displays and crawling around inside sophisticated hardware, and a good bit of computer jargon I only partly understood, but the general point is that the real computer nerd is Speckles. Remember, he's a mole. Make of that what you will.

There are also a few FBI agents who are trying to shut down the G-Force, mostly because they don't believe the project has justified its budget. And there's a great reconnaissance fly, which gives Ben a chance to inquire if the fly is OK, and when he gets an affirmative answer, says, ""I don't like it when my fly is down.""

Yes, it's that kind of humor, including some rather remarkable fart jokes. Also, when Juarez (a female) is bought for a silly little girl's pet, and she's all decked out like a Barbie doll, make note of how she describes herself when looking in a mirror. You may have to watch it more than once to catch all the great puns and sly references.

Good fun for grownups and older children, but perhaps a little confusing for rather little kids. I'd say 10 or up would love it.",1336608000,,1884,4.57566765578635

3768662,3,B001QOGY6I,"Watching the opening scenes of G-Force (2009), one is impressed by the combination of CGI characters and live action.  It certainly appears that the movie will be about something really cool, as a band of rodents equipped like a seal team, infiltrate the mansion of an industrialist suspected of engaging in nefarious activity.  Unfortunately after such a promising start, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's project with Disney slides downhill and into the tank, ending up heavily borrowing from the Transformers, in a terrible story that involves machines turning against mankind.

It's too bad because the guinea pigs are pretty cute and fun characters, and the animation is outstanding.  For the voice talent, Sam Rockwell and Nicolas Cage are very good, while Jon Favreau (Iron Man films) lays it on pretty thick.  Steve Buscemi is kind of funny, mainly overacting as a caricature of himself.  The human talent is not bad either with Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover), Kelli Garner, and Bill Nighy (Harry Potter And The Deathly Hollows: Part 1) hamming it up.

There are some funny bits, but there is a real problem is with the central storyline, which involves a computer virus causing appliances to go haywire, animate, and attack.  To foil this scheme the G-Force engage in some ridiculous over the top battles, taking on a killer coffee maker, and various other appliances that transform into hybrid machines of destruction.  It's technically impressive and flashy, but tends to make things way too complicated than they need to be.  The twist involving a traitor, is another element that really isn't necessary.  The connection between the G-Force and their human associates isn't as well established as it could have been either.  In short, the focus of the film appears to be misguided to some degree.

G-Force is perhaps worth seeing for its technical achievements.  The story may be pleasing to young children, but after a great start, it loses its way in attempting to be too spectacular, and fails to be as good as it could have been.",1311206400,,2042,5.038690476190476

They have to escape from a pet shop and stop the big villain is who is trying to destroy the world. When I found out who the villain was, it was just so funny, and when I realized who Nicholas Cage was doing the voice for, my admiration for him grew. He is so talented!

This is actually a very funny movie.  Starring mostly lesser name actors for the human characters, the guinea pigs are voiced by stars such as Steve Buscemi and Nicholas Cage.  The story is quite a simple; two scientists develop technology that gives human intellect and speech to small animals such as flies, guinea pigs and moles.  These upgraded animals are then used to fight international crime and terrorism.  This movie is part action, part comedy, and part adventure.  The special effects are kept low-key but they are effective, especially the movement of the animals.  The dialog is quite engaging, with each of the animals having their own unique personalities, attitudes and slang.  Best of all is the storyline, which keeps you guessing to the very last minutes of the movie.  Overall, quite worth the watch.",1298937600,,985,4.775147928994083
3768668,5,B001QOGY6I,"A really cute and funny family film. But it also has a really great life lesson that is the theme: if you really want to be special, you just believe that you are and that you don't have to change a single thing for that belief. Example, the guinea pigs think they were created in a lab. But they were actually ordinary and thanks to a scientist with a big heart, he believed that they are special and they became that way.

3768669,1,B001QOGY6I,"This was painful to watch. Really.

The story:

I was at the movie theater when I saw a preview for this movie. Almost instantly, I thought ""What a dumb movie.""

Six months later, I was home with my dad. There wasn't a whole lot on to watch, so I turned to On Demand.

Big mistake.

When I saw the movie, I thought, ""What the Heck? Who knows? I might even like it! I ended up buying it.

The guinea pigs had no personalities. They were all stereotypes. I couldn't care for these characters, no more than I could care for a rock. No. Actually, I could care for a rock more.

The plot was typical. Animals used as a disguise to save the world. I do admit, the coffee machine was actually kind of a good idea, but it was executed poorly. The long lost brother/sister/close friend/mother/father/cousin/aunt/uncle/etc. was used, a cliche I want to murder.

And the almost dying cliche. SERIOUSLY! How many movies have you seen like that? I'd like to know who started it. I want to hunt them down and murder them, along with the person that invented algebra. Now, I have nothing against the antagonist turning around but only after they've done harm. I actually somewhat like it, because it's more interesting than the killing of the antagonist. But the antagonist here turned around too quickly. Enough said.

Overall, a typical Animal Spy Movie. Seriously, that's being done so often I think it should become its own movie genre.",1296950400,,1425,4.600790513833992

3768705,2,B001QOGY6I,"G-Force is definitely one of those films that's hard to categorize.  In a way it reminds of many of Jerry Bruckheimer's works in that it's supposed to be an adventure flick with a bit of comedy but it somehow feels askew (Pirates of the Caribbean anyone?).  All of that feeling transfers here but the difference is that this one is clearly targeted toward an even younger demographic which is bad for two reasons: 1) It isn't bright and crisp like a kids' movie should be and 2) Kids rarely drive themselves to the theater, DVD store meaning adults will likely be watching this one with them.  This is why intelligent humor, even if it goes right over the heads of the kids watching the picture, is crucial.  Sadly, it is lacking here, bit more on that later.

The film revolves around a team of trained secret agent animals: guinea pigs Darwin (team leader) (Sam Rockwell), Juarez (martial arts) (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), Blaster (weapons specialist) (Tracy Morgan), the mole Speckles (cyber intelligence) (Nicolas Cage), and a fly named Mooch (surveillance) (Edwin Louis).

This team, in effort to prove its worth as a federally funded agency, takes on a risky mission for the US government to stop evil billionaire Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy), who plans to destroy the world by integrating communication chips into household appliances manufactured and distributed by his company. Before they can complete the mission, the government shuts them down and plans to eliminate the animal-agents because they know too much.  Not only do they find themselves running for their lives, the task of saving man kind from the attack of the killer appliances rests in their pint-sized laps as well.

Well I suppose part of the blame for this travesty rests in my apparent lack of pre-purchase investigation.  Despite product descriptions, reviews and even a DVD label that gives up absolutely no clue to the fact that this is in fact a live-action film that just so happens to feature some computer generated animated characters, which is precisely what this is.

Not to take anything away from any of the dozens of movies that work of this formula (actually come to think of it, nearly every film made within the past few years has come to rely upon the tactic in one degree or another), it does make a world of difference when one goes into it expecting a fully animated feature ala Cars, Shrek or Ratatouille.

The formula for G-Force is almost clever enough to be novel but the film just happens to place itself soundly into the void that exists between children young enough to be dazzled by the cuteness of the visuals and adults old enough to scoff at the ridiculousness of it all.

This isn't mere speculation either as I was unable to use the film to hold the attention of the younger set who found the premise too dark, deep and simply boring and yet tweeners and full ought teens I showed it to were equally disinterested on account of the sheer silliness of it all.

What you have at the end of the day with G-Force is a film that sparkles with creativity and even shines in a few rare moments of well timed comedy or action but does nothing well enough to warrant owning or for that matter even watching.",1283644800,,3205,4.722222222222222

Now, this film could have worked, if the correct approach was taken. Nope, I don't know what that approach would be; but this film took the wrong one. The cheesy jokes, the bad acting, and the ridiculous story all contribute to this film's failure.

Sadly, I watched the entire film, and the last few parts were the worst. Giant explosions and a giant robot attack the wise-cracking guinea pigs. But this
scene was actually kind of boring.

STARRING: Zach Galifianakis, Bill Nighy, Will Arnett, Kelli Garner, Tyler Patrick Jones and the voices of: Sam Rockwell, Penelope Cruz, Nicolas Cage, Jon Favreau, Tracy Morgan and Steve Buscemi

WRITTEN BY: Cormac Wibberley, Marianne Wibberley and Hoyt Yeatman

DIRECTED BY: Hoyt Yeatman

Rated: PG
Genre: Comedy / Family
Release Date: 24 July 2009

If Jerry Bruckheimer's name is attached, you know you are in for a treat. The biggest producer in Hollywood, and probably the only one of his trade known by name, has brought us another hit.

G-Force is tons of fun for kids and parents alike. It has the visual spark and humor that youngsters will enjoy, and a very innovative plot that adults will marvel over. Best of all, it's clean enough for the whole family.

If you've read one or two of my reviews, then you are probably familiar with my distaste for computer graphics being abused. The friendly rodents in G-Force are prime examples of computer generated images (CGI) put to their best use. These are characters worthy of CGI animation, rather than puppets or mechanical props.

Sam Rockwell leads a team of genetically altered guinea-pigs as the voice of Darwin. Penelope Cruz is Juarez, Tracy Morgan is Blaster and Nicolas Cage is hilarious as a mole named Speckles. It's tough, but if you listen closely you can hear Cage's voice in there somewhere.

Zach Galifianakis plays a governmental scientist named Ben. It was a shocker to see him here, I'll admit, but he's brilliant and plays his character straight.

Ben is in charge of a secret government program known as `G-Force.' He has personally trained these three guinea-pigs and Speckles in the art of secret spy tactics. When `G-Force' isn't being taken seriously by officials, Ben executes an unauthorized mission to show them what `G-Force' is capable of.

The team discovers that nasty criminal lord Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy) has plans for world domination via a dangerous weapon. `Leonard Saber', now that's a name for a villain! They quickly take action to uncover his secret, but somehow their incriminating data has been erased. Now they face the threat of being shut down completely.

Before Ben's supervisors are able to capture the little fury clan, they outsmart them with some wild trickery and escape. Working together, they must find a way to fold Saber's evil plot, before the whole world falls victim to his madness.

On their journey they meet up with a few other cuddly characters voiced by Jon Favreau and Steve Buscemi. Could you ask for more from a film of this genre?",1279670400,,2566,4.9257540603248255
3768711,2,B001QOGY6I,"G-Force is a great movie, I highly recommend it, but wait for a better DVD Treatment.

3768737,3,B001QOGY6I,"As the film's tagline describes, Disney's family picture ""G-Force"" is about ""Gadgets, Gizmos, (and three) Guinea Pigs."" To be precise, they are specially trained talking guinea pigs who aspire to be top spy agents for FBI. Don't ask me why these cute little talking animals want to be a spy. A film needs a story.

Meet the FBI's secret agent team created by a genius scientist Ben (Zach Galifinakis) and his assistant Marcie (Kelli Garner). They are three guinea pigs Darwin, Blaster, Juarez, one star-nosed mole Speckles and a fly Mooch. But its seems FBI superiors are not impressed enough, so Ben, without their permission, sends out the squad to investigate the billionaire Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy), owner of Saberling Technology.

Ben's sulky immediate superior (Will Arnett) is not happy to know their unauthorized activities. Moreover, the results of their spy mission turn out something totally unexpected. This means big trouble for the animals, so they all flee from the laboratory ... to where?

""G-Force,"" produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, has amazing visuals (even seen in 2-D) with thrilling non-stop action set-pieces, but the story is too weak to hold our attention. We don't know why Ben and his ""G-Force"" team have to ""impress"" the FBI. Who wouldn't be impressed with talking rodents? Bill Nighy's character is so unmemorable and we don't know what he really wants to do. To make matters worse, we don't know for what these animals are fighting, either.

Like the live-action version of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" (2007), ""G-Force"" is a pleasant and innocuous film with first-rate visuals. What these films need is a better story and less stereotypical characters.",1270339200,,1681,5.124087591240876

The story, such as it was, was long on explosions, action and impure, non-humorous jokes, and short on good acting and heart. It was probably made primarily for pre-teen boys. I didn't empathize or identify with the character's plights at all.

The story was simplistic, about a misfit team of animals saving the world. Humans were depicted as dolts at the mercy of the animals' superior intellects. The acting, whether voice characters or live action, was tongue-in-cheek and dull, with the exception of Nicolas Cage's part. It seemed like they couldn't get into the story.

Perhaps the gag lines were held in check as they meant for this to be more for kids than adults.

Albeit with characters geared toward the younger generation, those of us who are young at heart, will enjoy the story as well as the characters.  In the same manner as ""Cars"", ""Shrek"" as well as others before it, there are many moments in G-Force when the ""younger"" generation is not going to ""get it.""

I admit it.  I'm a sucker for the CGI genre of animation.  But even if I weren't, I'd recommend buying G-Force, strongly!  This is one of those wonderful action/adventure/buddy films that we constantly see, except it's main stars are CG guinea pigs.  And you know what?  It's hard to tell that the animal actors aren't real animals to which some CG artist has applied facial expressions.  In fact, in the scenes involving real dogs and CG animal actors, the average viewer would be hard-put to determine which is which.

And the plot is nice as well.  We've got five team members, a vole, three guinea pigs and a fly, who ACT as a team - complete with banter, friendship, competition and individual personalities - who find themselves cut loose from their support systems even as they realize that there's a plot to (Well, no need to give away the story here, am I right?)...

Oh wait, this is Disney. Of course the cute and cuddly critters (plus additional sidekicks scooped up along the way) will emerge victorious. You just have to sit through 90 minutes of stuff blowing up, lots of pop-culture references and plenty of fart and poop jokes.

Jerry Bruckheimer brings his usual penchant for things that go boom to the arena of kids' movies. If you understand that, you'll have a good idea of what ""G-Force"" has in store for you. The CGI is first rate, but the rodents aren't really all that interesting. And was there really any reason for stunt casting here? Nicholas Cage, for instance brought nothing unusual to his voicing of Speckles, and Sam Rockwell could have been any over-pumped action DJ for the voice of Darwin. I am starting to long for the days of Mel Blanc, when the characters had, well, character.

Otherwise, ""G-Force"" went down just fine with my 6 year old nephew, which is what mattered. I had the twist figured out by the time the initial animal raid on Saber goes awry (and that's about 10 minutes into the film). Bruckheimer is still blowing things up, but in the old-fashioned Road Runner sort of way (the car chase through the fireworks display actually did make me laugh), and I couldn't help but think of what kind of movie could be made out of pumping Alvin, Simon and Theodore up into action heroes.

Can a guinea pig be sultry? Well, perhaps to another guinea pig. In the midst of their mission, the FBI is trying to shut down their operation.... and temporary owners are trying to maim them!

You can tell all the actors had fun with their roles. There are a number of chase scenes, making use of Habitrail-ish exercise bubbles.

Clearly I was watching too many weird Betty Boop cartoons in which everything is alive and sometimes creepy.

Anyway, I bring this dark secret to light because in G-Force, a coffee machine -- which normally is something I like and admire -- becomes a terrifying creature. Fortunately, the hamsters save the day. Whew!

We live in a wondrous age where computers can make it seem like cute hamsters can conquer evil and do it with some attitude. G-Force is clearly a franchise in the making, aimed squarely at popcorn-munching kids. My ten-year-old thought it was just fine.

While Nicolas Cage worked on his finances by providing the voice of a mole and other celebrities also voiced various critters, including Penelope Cruz, Jon Favreau, Sam Rockwell and Steve Buscemi, this was Tracy Morgan's show all the way. And speaking of shows, hearing his performance put me very much in the mind of Saturday Morning TV shows of the 1970's. Morgan would be right at home doing voices for Hanna-Barbera, Filmation or Sid & Marty Krofft. When Hong Kong Phooey is inevitably made into a big-budget theatrical movie, look no further for the lead role.

Okay, I'm done being snarky. G-Force is a solid kid's adventure that's perfect for weekend afternoons. And it's not slapped together thoughtlessly, either. There is an interesting audio commentary from director Hoyt H. Yeatman, Jr. , a special effects veteran whose career includes Star Trek The Motion Picture, E.T. and Close Encounters. His comments can get pretty techie, too, when he mentions equipment by name and model number.

The Blu-Ray/DVD combo includes the commentary, deleted scenes, ""bloopers,"" ""Blaster's Boot Camp"" and ""G-Force Mastermind: The Inspiration Behind the Movie,"" there are three features that can only be accessed on the Blu_Ray, which is packaged with the DVD and a digital copy in the ""Best Value"" set.",1261526400,,2045,5.020648967551622

3768887,1,B001QOGY6I,"Animal animation movies need several key elements to be noteworthy - ""G-Force"" struck out on all of them.
(1.) First, voices are important to feel that the animated animal characters are alive so you need to choose actors with voices that enhance their character. These rodents voices were bland, unemotional and failed to convey the soul of each rodent. And the content of each voice is the script which was simplistic, sophomoric and cliche ridden.
(2.) Second, we need a creative, thoughtful and believable well-constructed story. ""G-Force"" was just another ethnic stereotype of animals chasing and being chased by bad guys out to destroy the world with the laughable (as in dumb) tools of toasters and other household appliances turning into walking killing machines along with satellite debris being forced (somehow) to crash into Earth. I should point out to the less than literate writers that 90% of the debris is small stuff that will burn up in the atmosphere and the rest, if able to survive burning up, would have no impact on the future of our planet.
(3.) Third, animations have evolved in the last decade to become artful creations in themselves. Disney is still churning out the cheap off the shelf animations that cost little to make but produce a nice monetary return for this studio's meager efforts.  The graphics were so bad they had to rely on the now time worn formula of dated hip-hop dancing, singing animals to give the movie some entertainment value.",1261353600,7,1477,4.931726907630522
3768888,2,B001QOGY6I,"I would strongly recommend that you rent this film and view it BEFORE you decide to buy it. Most viewers, young or old, are unlikely to want to watch it twice.

The animation of this little film is first-rate. What it lacks is a good script with characters who have some traits we can care about one way or the other. In only two brief passages, both near the ending, did this movie come to life.

OVER THE HEDGE, KUNG FU PANDA, ICE AGE, MADAGASCAR, its sequel, MADAGASCAR--ESCAPE 2 AFRICA, and especially HAPPY FEET are examples of films with talking animals that do hold the interest of people of all ages and DO make us care what is happening.",1261180800,3,646,4.420168067226891
3768889,4,B001QOGY6I,"What happens when you take a secret government program of trained animals and combine them with the latest in high-tech spy equipment? The result is G-FORCE.

The film became the first 3D film on the big screen by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""National Treasure"" films, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""The Rock, ""Con Air"" and ""Top Gun"") who teams up once again with Academy Award-winning visual effects master Hoyt H. Yeatman (""The Abyss"", ""Mighty Joe Young"", ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"") who directs the film.

The film about animals saving the world didn't go to well with the critics but at the box office, ""G-Force"" was quite successful as the film which was budgeted at $82.5 million made over $281 million worldwide.

Featuring an all-star cast, ""G-FORCE"" revolves around a secret US Government program using guinea pigs Darwin (voice by Sam Rockwell) as the squad leader, Blaster (voice of Tracy Morgan) as the outrageous weapons expert with attitude and Juarez (voice of Penlope Cruz) as the sexy martial arts pro and taking part in top secret espionage missions.

Joining the guinea pigs is star-nosed mole, Speckles (voice of Nicolas Cage), the computer and information specialist, the computer and information specialist and Mooch, the reconnaissance expert.  Also, featuring pet shop layabout Hurley (voice by Jon Favreau) and territorial hamster Bucky (voice of Steve Buscemi).

The film also stars Bill Nighy as the sinister industrialist Leonard Saber, Will Arnett as Special Agent Kip Killian who is bent on shutting down G-FORCE, Zach Galifianakis as the creator and father figure of G-FORCE, Kelli Garner as the team's veterinarian and many more.

The ""G-Force"" Blu-ray release comes with the Blu-ray, a DVD and a digital copy.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""G-Force"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The actual merging of CG animation and real characters actually works extremely well for this film.  Sony Pictures ImageWorks did a wonderful job on the CG and special effects.  A lot of good ideas were implemented in the film in terms of the animation of the G-Force team.  Especially hair effects as you can see the detail of the animals when they are wet or dry.  As usual with Disney releases on Blu-ray, picture quality is fantastic.  Along with the details of the G-Force team, their surroundings are detailed and when outdoors, the colors are vibrant.  Blacks are nice and deep and I spotted no problems with artifacting, banding at all.

Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. Lossless audio is actually pretty well done.  Good utilization of the rear channels for the action scenes, as explosions and glass shattering comes out quite clear from the surround channels.  ""G-Force"" tends to use quite a bit of music from the Black Eyed Peas, Lady GaGa and Flo Rida, so the music is quite clear and contains quite a bit of bass.  Subwoofer tends to utilize the bass of the music quite a bit.  But overall, a solid lossless audio track.

As for the voice acting, I felt the talent did a good job.  Nicolas Cage really surprised me with his squeaky, nerdy voice for  tech master Speckles.  Penelope Cruz as the voice of female guinea pig Juarez worked quite well.  Although, Tracy Morgan sounds like Tracy Morgan but overall, the voice talent did a good job.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""G-Force"" contains several special features in 1080p or 1080i, English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital and with English SDH, French or Spanish subtitles:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""G-Force"" may not have been a popular film among the critics but for a family film, ""G-Force"" was actually fun.  The idea of ""G-Force"" came from Hoyt H. Yeatman's five year old son at the time about wanting to use his animals to take on bad guys.  And it's an idea that visual master Yeatman toiled around his head and six years later, became a feature film.

Special effects were done quite well and there are many big budget films where CG animation and real-life filmmaking just doesn't work but for ""G-Force"", it worked quite well (especially if it costs over $80 million to make, it better work well).

Parents may wonder why the film has a PG rating and there is mild action with the team trying to take on Saber's ""weapons"" but in terms of the rude humor, there is a lot of farting (courtesy of the gassy guinea pig Hurley) and scenes where the rodents are stuck in a sphere and you hear jokes such as ""get your butt out of my face.  No, you get your face out of my butt"" type of jokes but that is the worst it gets.  Now of course, there are scenes where a child puts one of the G-Force team members in a remote control car and crashes it into G.I. Joe action figures or tries to jump a ramp with it inside the car.  And another scene where a girl plays dress up with the guinea pig and puts nail polish and lipstick on the animal.  Of course, parents who have children with hamsters or guinea pigs will best explain to them not to do that at home despite seeing it onscreen.

As far as the Blu-ray release is concerned, you get a solid 3-disc release (Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy) and plenty of special features to keep the children busy during this holiday season.  The ""Cine-Explore"" feature was especially well-utilized on this Blu-ray release.

In the end, this film is a enjoyable, action-packed family film targeted for the children.  I've read many reviews by critics who just have a disdain of rodents saving the world via technology and look at it as a stupid concept.  Granted, for some of those reviewers, I'm sure when they were children, the concept of Lassie, Flipper and Benji were probably regarded by critics of their time as a bit over-the-top as well.  Granted, those animals were not hooked up to high tech devices and were used to save the world but granted, this is not the film to exactly take seriously.  The same happened with the release of ""Stuart Little"" back in 1999 and critics had a hard time moving past the talking rodent but sure enough, that film inspired sequels and direct-to-DVD movies and was quite successful.

Overall, I felt it ""G-Force"" was a fun concept.  Where ""Stuart Little"" was more of a happy film about family, ""G-Force"" was about camaraderie and trying to save the world.  Sure, the concept is farfetched but if you're taking this film that seriously, you're not going to enjoy this film at all.  I watched it along with my six-year-old and we both enjoyed it.  And as a parent, I felt it was a fun film with action, hijinks and a lot of music from The Black Eyed Peas.

3768891,2,B001QOGY6I,"Ben (Zach Galifianakis) has spent his life working with rodents.  And it's paid off.  This FBI scientist has figure out a way to communicate with them and train them to go on covert missions.  But his funding is about to be taken away.  As a last second hail Mary, he sends out his crack team, consisting of a fly, three guinea pigs, and a mole, to infiltrate a house and get a file off a computer.

The mission is a big success, or so it appears.  The next day, at the review, things go horribly wrong and the project is shut down.  The rodents manage to escape to a pet store, but the FBI wants them to keep the entire project completely secret.  Can the rodents escape and foil the plot they've uncovered?  Or will the FBI track them down first?

I talked into seeing this movie by my roommate.  The previews just never convinced me it would be great.  And I was right.

Now don't get me wrong.  There were some genuine laughs in the film.  The mice we meet in the pet store stole the show, for example.  I couldn't stop laughing at them.  The effects were very well done, too.  But the majority of the movie wasn't that great.

The plot was full of cliches from start to finish.  That's not necessarily a deal killer for me, but the rest of the movie has to be good enough to make up for it, and it wasn't.

One of the big problems was that the movie just didn't feel like it was going anywhere.  There were lots of jokes and pop cultural references, and I felt like they were designed to hide the fact that the plot was weak from us.  Even the characters were flat and dull.  And I really feel sorry for the humans in the movie who were little more than cardboard characters.  Even the dialogue the characters had was so trite it was cringe worthy.

If you can see this movie for free, you'll find a few good laughs.  But it isn't worth paying any money for.",1260835200,7,1863,4.203966005665722

As for price not being valid to a review, it is valid.  There are some movies I'd buy no matter what the price based on quality.  The classics are high up there.  Would I compare this movie to UP?  Certainly not.  Would I pay $27.99 for UP on blu ray, most definitely.  That says a lot about the movie to me, what I'm willing to pay for it.  I purchased Snow White on Amazon, digital, dvd and blu ray copy for $19.99, minus $10 for a holiday sale.  Well worth it because it appeals to young and old and is a classic lovely movie.

G Force, highly entertaining to a child who enjoys silly humor and gimmicks and some potty humor.  Enjoyed watching it with my child for her delight, but does it remain in my head to ponder like UP, nope.  I like to read reviews that give me an idea of what something is worth price wise.  THAT to ME makes a review invaluable.  Should I pay $200 for a bread machine when there is a $50 on?  WHat makes one worth it over the other?  Thus I review based on price also because there are many who appreciate that.  If you don't, go ahead and go to the review that appeals to you, don't discourage others from reviewing as such.",1260316800,2,1483,4.133333333333334

There is a section toward the end of the movie which is a cheesy take off from transformers that really made the end disappointing.  There are cute moves and the James Bond type gagets are funny.

3768936,1,B001QOGY6I,"I don't mean to be negative about it, but this movie is just another one of those ""let's put animals in the movie so that we can impress the kids"" but my son and his friends would not sit in the theater to watch the movie because it did not catch their attention very well.  At first, they thought it was cool because the hamsters were talking, but then they just got bored.  It is pretty sad when talking gerbils do not even thrill 6-year-olds... maybe animal lovers liked it?",1259020800,8,477,4.288888888888889
3768937,5,B001QOGY6I,I went and saw G-force by myself when it was in theaters because I love almost all Disney movies and also because this movie looked really adorable.  I went to a showing that cost me $4 admission but the movie was great so it would have been worth the cost of regular admission.  It had a twist of sorts that I didn't expect and is a great movie for all ages.  I am definitely planning on buying the Blu-ray edition of the movie so that I can watch it on DVD until I buy a Blu-ray player.  I recommend this movie to anyone with kids or anyone who gew up on Disney movies and loved them like I did/do.,1258588800,4,600,4.016806722689076

A team of super intelligent guinea pigs named Darwin, Juarez, Blaster, and Speckles infiltrate the residence of Leonard Saber, who has been under FBI investigation for years. Saber has a sinister scheme that is set to occur in 29 hours. When the G-Force are shut down by the FBI, they must band together to stop Saber by any means necessary. When the evil plot happens, the gang must stop an unlikely villain who has betrayed them. Will G-Force save the world? I highly recommend G-FORCE!!!",1254096000,15,650,4.660869565217391

3768941,3,B001QOGY6I,"We were trying to figure out which family-friendly movie to take our almost 5 year-old this weekend, and though I was rooting for ""Ponyo"", hubby favored ""G-Force"", so that's what we watched. It was fun, but this is definitely one of those movies that require you to check your brains at the door. The plot is rather silly, about an entrepreneur [played by Bill Nighy of all people] who plans on taking over the world via his home appliances. The only ones who seem able to stop him are a bunch of guinea pigs, and yes, a mole of superior intellect who have been trained to carry out espionage activities. The guinea pigs comprise Darwin, Juarez, Blaster, and the mole is called Speckles. Well, the Feds get wind of the operation and shut it down, and the animals find themselves in a pet store. To cut a long story short - the rest of the movie deals with Darwin and company trying to free themselves and help bring the bad guy down.

My almost 5-year-old was riveted to the screen though a lot of the humor seemed lost on her. The humor was ok, though it did seem pitched more to older kids than the younger ones. There are lots of cute moments as is typical for movies like this, and the CGI effects are pretty decent though not spectacular. My main complaint is the use of tech-speak which came across as overly heavy for a movie geared towards kids...I understand why it was used, but it seemed rather unnecessary. Final verdict - family-friendly, mindless kids' entertainment with the requisite positive messages embedded within, i.e. teamwork, friendship, believing in one's self etc.",1252281600,14,1590,4.638297872340425
3768942,5,B001QOGY6I,"A line from the movie.  I loved it.  I mean, what else can a guinea pig do to defend itself?

There is a team of combat-trained, commando guinea pigs. They call themselves the G-Force and go on special missions, like Special Agents.  I saw this 3-D Disney flick in the movies and found it very cute and entertaining. Their mission is to break into the estate of a former arms dealer, hack into his computer, and find out what he developed this special microchip for.  This one FBI Special Agent (Sector Head, I guess) doesn't see any use for the G-Force, so when they APPEAR to have botched a mission, the FBI guy shuts down the operation and the commandos wind up for sale in a pet store. Of course, the story begins here with the team trying to get out and back together again, and continue on with their mission. One of the guinea pigs is Penelope Cruise and another is Nicholas Cage and there are others. It's cute and it has great computer graphic imaging.  It seems to be fine for little children. The worst I remember hearing was ""poop in his hand"" and ""get your face out of my butt.""  There were a bunch of little ones at the theater and they all seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. (Hey, my inner child insisted on being entertained.)",1249257600,10,1251,4.32051282051282

8336130,2,B001QOGY6I,"My little boys (5yo & 10yo) liked it alright, but no one else in the family really did.  Interestingly, the human actors were far poorer than the CGI animals, in terms of expression, etc.  How did that happen?
There are funny parts to laugh at, even for the adults, but ... reasonably predictable, very tidy, sigh.  We chose it as the movie for a ""Boy Night"" and they were happy.  The next night was ""Girl Night"" and we watched *Leap* which was a far better story and one the whole family enjoyed (10yo boy, too, but not so much the 5yo boy!).",1524873600,,543,4.294117647058823
