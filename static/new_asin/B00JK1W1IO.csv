8651617,5,B00JK1W1IO,"This film began the sixties film from England explosion.  It's the best performance of Laurence Harvey's career.  Simone won Best Actress that year.  Well directed.  A very powerful film about the consequences of greed.  The sequel ""Life At the Top"" with Jean Simmons is interesting, but lacks the fire of this film.  Strongly recommended.",1518652800,,339,5.185185185185185
8651618,4,B00JK1W1IO,"This film seems about a decade ahead of its time: Mature subject matter and matter-of-fact handling of adult situations. Simone Signoret gives a sublime and seamless performance; it's easy to see why she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this role. My only criticism is the print itself; while not the worst I've ever seen, it's not close to being the best transfer either. This excellent film needs a remastering badly.",1517875200,,429,4.890410958904109

8651621,3,B00JK1W1IO,"The film is one of my favorites, but the quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired. Specifically, the smooth, subtle beauty of black-and-white film is lost in this translation, which is pretty muddy and course. But that's the price you sometimes have to pay to get a copy of a film at reasonable cost that is otherwise very hard to come by.",1429920000,7,348,4.453125
