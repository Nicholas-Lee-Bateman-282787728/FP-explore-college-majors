7920466,3,B00004L8KO,"You have to dig pretty deep in the stack of unwanted horror sequels to find a movie like ""976-Evil II."" The follow-up to the Robert Englund-directed schlocker, this sequel takes place a few years later and finds our hapless biker-bro hero from the first movie (Pat O'Bryan) hitting the road to kick it with a teenage girl (Debbie James) and hang up on the film's phoney villain once and for all. Along the way, he has to battle with a lazy demonic force and an unfortunate case of road rash.

Directed by skin-flick aueteur Jim Wynorski (""The Hills Have Thighs""), ""976-Evil II"" is not only serviceable, but goes so far as to surpass the original. That might not be a terribly tall order, but given this film's micro-budget and direct-to-video status, the fact that it's even watchable is a minor miracle in and of itself. Thank Wynorski, who has just as keen an eye for his female subjects as he does some surprisingly competent stuntwork and car crashes that culminate in an absolutely off-the-wall forray into ""It's A Wonderful Life."" The film opens with a surprisingly stylish bang, owing its vaguely tense opening scene to the great giallo flicks of the '70s. Sadly, the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to that strong set-up. Regardless, Wynorski is willing to try just about anything, and there's something of interest happening every five to ten minutes (hey look, it's Brigitte Nielsen!), and that's more than can be said for the original.

No, you haven't discovered some hidden gem with this unloved sequel, but rather, have hit upon a rather solid way to pass an hour and a half. Fans of Wynorski 's classic ""Chopping Mall"" in particular will want to seek this out. See the original or don't; it doesn't matter. Despite the carry-over character, this re-dial maintains a very loose connection to its source material. So put away your hang ups and get ready for something slightly off the hook. ""976-Evil II"" might be worth dialing into.",1513468800,,1953,4.775147928994083
7920467,4,B00004L8KO,"I don't get why give a movie 1 star just because it's not your type of film. This is a comedy-horror from the wild-hair days. It's not Titanic or Jurassic Park; but considering the time, the budget and the genre - it's fun to watch. No intellectual content, just a cheesy plot with some interesting ideas. I watch movies like this while doing house chores, not glued to the screen.",1510444800,,381,4.457142857142857

7920469,1,B00004L8KO,"Never watched the first one. never will, after watching this one.  The plot was kind of teen slasher flick, aged slightly -we start off with a definite slasher-esque scene in the local high school pool, locker-shower room, and stage but the main ""kids"" are actually graduated and one is in community college (where she also works).  It might have been meant to be the community college but frankly I've never seen one with a drama club, stage, and pool.  But after the start of the movie the gore occurs but is never as extensive as in slasher movies, and the bizarrely funny horror show starts.  I love old fashioned horror flicks (eg Karloff's Frankenstein) with weird/supernatural unreal elements/themes done so matter of factly they draw you into the story; this movie is nothing like that, being instead a sometimes scary story with a supernatural element botched by such moments as multiple dialogue disconnects (she: I don't know, I guess I could try. he: You have to try."", deadpan hilarious references to older items not everyone may get, and LOL ""frights"" (you have to see the trapped in a house by the bad uns scene to believe it, but you'll laugh yourself sick at how over the top it gets). After rolling my eyes at the dumb beginning, being interested in the next few scenes, and laughing like mad at the stupid not-scary stuff I gave up when the movie committed non-religious sacrilege. Fast forwarded to see the actual (annoying) end. Yucko.",1486166400,,1456,4.788844621513944

7920473,3,B00004L8KO,"976 Evil 2 was an alright movie, it wasn't as good as the first one but for a sequel they didn't do to bad with it. The storyline is conpletely different but with the same charactor who starred on the first movie. If anything i give part 2 three-stats cuz it kept me entertained. Itz a shame they didn't think more about a third one cuz this franchise wouldve been good with 3.",1455494400,,377,4.178082191780822
7920474,2,B00004L8KO,"Robin's Dean at her Community College, Mr. Grubeck, is the Slate River serial killer. The police catch him, but he uses ""astral projection"" to escape jail and kill some more. He wants Robin to be his mate IN HELL. Not if Spike Jones (?!) and his leather jacket and motorcycle and goofy noises can help it. At one point, I thought I was watching The Blues Brothers with all the car wrecks. Speaking of car wrecks, yeah, this wasn't very good.",1357603200,,441,4.45679012345679
