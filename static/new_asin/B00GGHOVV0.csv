8622779,4,B00GGHOVV0,"OK Spanish-made (English-dubbed) horror film starring Paul Naschy (Jacinto Molino) as the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky.  This time he saves a wealthy woman whose husband has just been murdered by robbers while on holiday in a most depressing looking place in Transylvania.  The woman and Daninsky fall in love and she takes him back to England so her good friend Dr. Jekyll (a descendant of the original) can attempt to cure him of his hairy problem.  The doc figures he can inject Daninsky with the Mr. Hyde formula and change him to Mr. Hyde, so the brute can fight off the werewolf curse and doc can inject the antidote, therefore solving both problems.  His nurse is jealous of his friendship with the rich woman and throws a monkey wrench into the whole works.  I have no interest in the second feature and have not seen it so I can't comment on it.  The werewolf feature is about 75 minutes long.  I had a VHS version that was about 88 minutes long so I know a more complete version is out in the world somewhere.  Other than that the DVD is good quality and I recommend it for fans of the genre.",1416096000,2,1100,4.465
