8095569,1,B000C3L2AC,Forget this movie. Very disappointing. Skip to the end for some real swing dancing (extra features).,1474156800,,100,5.3125
8095570,4,B000C3L2AC,"I like this movie mainly because of the top-notch dancing.  The story line is okay, the writing not so okay at times.  I wish Jonathan Winters had had a better venue for his last movie.",1447113600,,185,4.257142857142857
8095571,2,B000C3L2AC,"If you are looking for something comparable to Swing Kids, or even to the B movies they used to make back in the '40s, this ain't it. The plot is an assortment of clichs that might have been salvaged from old Leave it to Beaver out takes and the really bad Twilight Zone episodes cobbled together in slapdash fashion. Jonathan Winters and Jaqueline Bisset are completely wasted, and Tom Skerrit plays the same character he always plays. The dancing is mediocre at best, and the supposedly talented singer appears to be suffering some sort of gastric distress every time he picks up his guitar. The one bright spot of the movie is Nell Carters rendition of Is You Is or Is You Aint My Baby, which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of its richly deserved one.",1392422400,,770,4.468085106382978
8095572,5,B000C3L2AC,I loved the whole movie.  It had real meaning to life!  We enjoyed it very much. It was really good.,1382918400,,100,3.95
8095573,4,B000C3L2AC,"This sweet little movie brings together a variety of talented performers in unusual roles; Jonathan Winters is here ad libbing with his usual genius, the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset not only captivates as the Muse who introduces a young man to Swing and teaches him to follow his bliss, she is riveting as an much older version of this character -- a woman whose body can no longer dance to the music she is still hearing in her head. A very touching performance.  Barry Bostwick does a lovely turn as the Muse's dance partner.  And the final gift is a song over the credits by the incomparable Nell Carter, who plays a sassy nurse.  This movie is for people who love Swing and want to be reminded of a kinder, gentler era, where ""follow your dreams"" meant simply listening to your heart.
Recommended for boomers, kids who love retro, dancers, and those who want to reminisce.",1177545600,,876,4.638709677419355
8095574,1,B000C3L2AC,"This film missed the boat in so many ways. I will grant you that the sets are good, BUT the acting (a few exceptions), the directing, the scripting and the editing are uniformly baaaaaaaaad. Tom Skerrit and Mindy Cohn did the most with the little they were given, Jacqueline Bisset (Christine/Mrs. DeLuca), unfortunately, did not. The young leads lack the skills to do anything with their material. The whole film was much like watching 8 year olds putting on a play and thinking up their dialog as they went along. Bad.",1159315200,,520,4.725274725274725
8095575,5,B000C3L2AC,"This is the greatest swing movie ever!!!It's a fantasy Movie about a struggling musician who arrives at a danceclubhouse that's trapped in time that's reminiscent of movies like""Field of Dreams. It has a great cast featuring Constance Brenneman,Jonathan Winters and Jacqueline Bissett. It's great that it's now on DVD!!!",1152576000,,320,5.551020408163265
