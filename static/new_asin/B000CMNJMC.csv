2465731,5,B000CMNJMC,"This was a truly inspiring video. I believe he book would do her more justice but this should tell people inspite of the obstacles and challenges in life, Wilma Rudolf became the best she could be. She did have a great support system  in her life and that is what I believe makes the story great.",1303344000,,296,4.285714285714286
2465732,5,B000CMNJMC,"THIS IS A TRUE STORY OF A GIRL WHO FIGHTS POLO AND GOES ON TO WIN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS.
ALSO IN THIS MOVIE IS DENZEL WASHINGTON, THIS WAS THE FIRST MOVIE HE WAS IN.",1300233600,,163,3.823529411764706
2465733,4,B000CMNJMC,Great movie.  I learned alot about Wilma from watching this movie.  This must have been one of Denzel's first movies.  He was not cute at all with that big chipped tooth. Lol,1298332800,,174,4.375
2465734,5,B000CMNJMC,"Good family movie. Entertaining movie with a few original clips from the Olympic games. Only one quick scene with kissing...everything else was ""G"" rated.",1278633600,,154,5.458333333333333
2465735,4,B000CMNJMC,The DVD was a good price and the service was excellent. I have not yet watched the movie so cannot comment on its value.,1262822400,,120,4.041666666666667
2465736,5,B000CMNJMC,I learned quite a lot that I did not know about a lady that I did see in the Rome Olympics. She was a great gift to our country and it is very sad that she died at only age 57. She could have continued to be an inspiration to a lot of young people.,1233532800,2,248,3.5272727272727273
2465737,5,B000CMNJMC,"This made for TV docudrama is the true story of Wilma Rudolph, one of America's greatest Olympic athletes. Wilma was born into a poor (by our standards), black family in Tennessee and rose to become the crowd favorite at the 1960 Olympics in Rome where she became the fastest woman in the world and the first American woman to win three gold medals in the same competition. Her journey included overcoming a debilitating case of polio at a young age which forced her to wear a brace and heavy shoes for several years and receive daily therapy. She also lived and competed in a world where being black in the deep South meant being segregated and second class. She also had to overcome an unwanted pregnancy which threatened to end her career early. It is an amazing story of perseverance and the love of a family and the support of her coach and community. As with Jesse Owens ahead of her and so many athletes, there is a coach behind her success, Ed Temple, the track coach at Tennessee State who saw in Wilma the raw potential of a great athlete. The movie builds to a climax with the Rome Olympics and shows all three of the actual events in which she won the gold medals. She also went on to become a role model for young women and the first real superstar female athlete and also an ambassador for amateur athletics.[...]",1216684800,9,1327,4.487603305785124
2465738,4,B000CMNJMC,"I really liked this movie and I can especially recommend it for family viewing. It shows a close, functioning family without excess sentimentality. The movie focuses on how Wilma overcame polio and personal obstacles to become a great runner and Olympic champion. Most of the movie deals with these struggles without too much time spent on the actual Olympic experience( nice original footage of the real Wilma in action).
  It also shows an era when real grown-ups were in charge.
  The characters are played very convincingly- Shirley Jo Finney as Wilma is especially good. I think anyone could enjoy this movie- and it's family entertainment at its best.",1210204800,3,657,5.055555555555555
2465739,5,B000CMNJMC,"I owned this in VHS format, and I was very happy to finally have it in DVD. Wilma Rudolph is an inspirational person - one who overcame polio, poverty, etc., to set the world on its heels in the Olympics. A very young Denzel Washington plays Robert, Wilma's love interest. Cicely Tyson is superb as usual. Although originally made for TV, the film speaks well to a turbulent time. I love the scenes when the Tennessee Tech. Coach Temple makes the jokes about FDR in his social studies lessons and when he makes his sprinters run cross country to build their endurance. It shows he was a man ahead of his time.",1199923200,7,609,4.446428571428571
2465750,4,B000CMNJMC,Good inspirational movie. The fact that it's a true story makes it even better. Seeing this young black woman overcome the obstacles of a medical condition to go on and win a gold medal in the Olympics. It's even more fascinating that this occurred during a time when black people could not sit in the front of a restaurant.,1445472000,,324,4.508474576271187

2465754,4,B000CMNJMC,"A very well written, directed,  educational film. My daughter had a school assignment to write an essay on Wilma Rudolph.  There was information in the film that we didn't find on Wikipedia. If gave us a clear picture of how difficult it must have been for Wilma to overcome all of the adversity in her like and succeed the way she did.  I'm glad we were able to find this film.",1426377600,,378,4.295774647887324
2465755,4,B000CMNJMC,Wonderful. Glad I purchased it. My girls are inspired by her story.,1424476800,,67,4.666666666666667

2465758,4,B000CMNJMC,"While I feel the story of ""Wilma"" is an incredibly inspiring story for all people, the film portays her in a somewhat sleazy manner. Argumentative, disloyal and self obsessed. I would hope that the ""real"" Wilmer was more like the audio book I heard on the radio, which lead me to purchase the film in the first place. The ""book"" Wilmer I could truly admire and point to for the inspiration of others regardless of race, color, or social status.",1410912000,,444,4.5625
2465759,5,B000CMNJMC,It was a fantastic story!  It was uplifting and inspirational and sent a clear message that obstacles can be overcome.,1389744000,,118,4.9
2465760,4,B000CMNJMC,"I used this durning the Holidays at a family gathering.
The was a great encouragement for the teen agers in the family.",1389571200,,119,4.454545454545454
2465761,4,B000CMNJMC,I think this movie could have been better as I expected more from Wilma movie since Wilma was phenomenal however nice to see it.,1382400000,,128,4.375
2465762,5,B000CMNJMC,"Watching the love that Wilma's parents had for Wilma made me cry. I identified closely with Wilma's dad (played by Joe Seneca) when he started to get sick and the actor's portrayal of a weak aging man made me see myself. I have arthritis and some days I too have ""Good days and bad days"", as Cicely Tyson (who plays a moving role as Wilma's mother) says to Coach Temple during a home visit. Coach Temple (played by Jason Bernard) was a tough but loving coach. He not only inspired Wilma to do her best, he inspired me to my best. We see a young Denzel Washington, who plays Wilma's boyfriend at age 18. Shirley Jo Finney (who plays Wilma) did a good job portraying a young woman who struggles to become a track star, but you could tell she was ""acting the part"". When ever I see actors ""acting the part"" of their character it lets me know that they are really not into their character. One has to enter into the character realm by eating, sleeping, and feeling every emotion of the character; then the viewer can see the true emotions of the character they are trying to act out.

Parents who are struggling to raise a child with disabilities should see this film, because the story's main theme is family values. Crying, sacrificing, and dreaming for that day when your child triumphs over life's difficulties is shown in this film. The conversations by Wilma's parents as they talk about Wilma's progress and set-backs are deeply moving.",1377820800,,1439,4.555984555984556
2465763,2,B000CMNJMC,"I didn;t like this movie,it felt so false. I thought I would like it but it just kept going on and on and really noe ending. I wouldn""t see this again either. I didn:t like the acting either",1370390400,,190,4.026315789473684
2465764,5,B000CMNJMC,"True life story, has good real world value. A lot can be learn't from older movies that where not affraid to share
the drama of a real life, and the decisions behind it.",1370131200,,169,4.151515151515151
2465765,5,B000CMNJMC,"A COOKIES AND PUNCH MOVIE BLACK FOLK WATCH, BUT NOT AT THE THEATERS. NOT DURING THE 1970's AND 1980's. A WONDERFUL MOVIE SUCH AS THIS COULD'VE, BUT SHOULD'VE BEEN A POPCORN THEATER BUTTER MOVIE IF REWRITTEN WITH BETTER PRODUCTION CREW. IT WAS A MADE FOR TV DOODY DOO DOO POO POO. IT WAS A COOKIES AND PUNCH IN FRONT OF THE TV PROGRAM WHICH TYPICALLY RE-AIRS ON TV ONE AND BET AS WELL AS ILLEGALLY BOOTLEGGED.",1368144000,,408,4.381578947368421
2465766,5,B000CMNJMC,This is an inspirational story that will live forever. I'm just sorry that Wilma didn't live a long life but her life is proof that it's not the length of your life that is most important - it is the quality of your life and how your life impacts the lives of others.,1367452800,,267,4.056603773584905
2465767,5,B000CMNJMC,Stars one of the all-time great actresses -  Cicely Tyson.  Anything with Cicely is great - I highly recommend this movie.,1364515200,,122,4.761904761904762
2465768,3,B000CMNJMC,I only bought this movie because I am a huge Denzel Washington fan. The movie itself was so-so but worth watching.,1353542400,,114,4.476190476190476

8099274,4,B000CMNJMC,"Not exactly a cinematic masterpiece, but tells with admirable accuracy the amazing and inspiring story of Wilma Rudolph. Quite well acted (includes Cicely Tyson after all) and Shirley Jo Finney at times looks so much like Wilma Rudolph that it was hard to tell which was her and which was the real Wilma. Glad they include the actual races from the Olympics. Good enough that I have since loaned it to two other people.",1461801600,,419,4.675675675675675
