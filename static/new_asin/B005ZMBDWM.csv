My brother who didn't want to see it ended up saying he loved it and that Cassey was his favorite character!",1328140800,6,179,4.0

4911084,5,B005ZMBDWM,Dog Jack more than met my expectations.  It tied in nicely with my unit on the history of racism in the United States.  My seventh-grade students loved it.,1427328000,3,155,4.5
4911085,5,B005ZMBDWM,"Having read the book, the film, like so many others, kept a few relevant pieces, then did its own thing.  Nevertheless, it was an excellent film and I enjoyed it very much.",1426723200,3,172,4.375
4911086,1,B005ZMBDWM,"very poorly done...must have been low low budget.
the actors were wearing MODERN TIMBERLAND BOOTS ...in 1860's?",1425513600,,111,5.588235294117647
4911087,1,B005ZMBDWM,This is one of (if not THE) worst movies I've ever seen.  The budget has nothing to do with the astounding historical inaccuracies and cultural misrepresentations.  Save your money for a Pizza with the family and watch something on the history channel.,1422662400,,252,4.976190476190476
4911088,1,B005ZMBDWM,This movie is horrible. It does not follow the book at at all.  Read the book stay away from this trash.,1420502400,,104,3.9523809523809526
4911089,1,B005ZMBDWM,"Worst acting ever. How did this movie get made? There was a director who said ""yea, that's good, keep doing that""? I think most school plays require a higher level of skill.",1419984000,,173,4.4375
4911090,1,B005ZMBDWM,"I was really excited to watch this tale. The kind of thing I like and it might have been a great movie. The acting was just plain bad except maybe the dog but did not see enough of him. Too violent too as I watched it with my son. Of course, it was set in a violent part of our history. Not to blame just could have been better handled I guess. Lou Gossett Jr. was the what I gave it a one star for. He did a great job narrating what I saw.",1398470400,5,440,3.6914893617021276
4911091,4,B005ZMBDWM,I just love a movie that anyone can watch and this was one of them very heart warming !!!  I love true stories !!,1385078400,3,113,3.7083333333333335
4911092,5,B005ZMBDWM,My older teens really liked this one. We may watch it again. I liked the fact that the young man was faithful to God.,1382659200,,117,3.9166666666666665
4911093,5,B005ZMBDWM,"This is a good family movie, but with the caveat that there is a degree of American Civil War-type violence in parts.  The story is captivating.  Also, there is a quiet Christian theme throughout; i.e., faith lost and faith regained.  It is not a glitzy movie, but the acting is good enough to hold one's interest in the immensely heart-warming though also sometimes heart-rending tale.  The story is actually focused on the young slave Jed, rather than his dog.  So it is not really a cutesy movie about a dog. But I highly recommend it.",1376870400,3,538,4.621052631578947
4911094,4,B005ZMBDWM,"I was motivated to watch this movie with my niece after reading about the dog that starred in the movie.  The role of Jack is played by a rescued pit bull named Piglet.  Neither Piglet nor her owner had any previous experience with film.  You can read about Piglet's rescue and subsequent move to stardom here:
[...]

Some people said the acting was a bit wooden.  I did not feel that way.  My grandmother was born in 1893.  Manners have changed over time, becoming less formal.  I felt like the acting gave the movie a feeling of having occurred in a very different time than our current era.",1366156800,4,593,4.425925925925926
4911095,3,B005ZMBDWM,"Although the scripting and acting was somewhat wooden, this movie had a generally good plotline with fairly decent carry-through in the fighting scenes, etc. There was one part where the soldiers were sitting around the campfire looking at a picture of a fat woman named Frye that I thought was completely crude. There were other scenes that lacked in professionalism as well, but for the most part the movie 'carried'.",1366070400,5,419,5.0
4911096,4,B005ZMBDWM,This family film is based on the true adventures of a dog who joined the Union Army during the Civil War! There is some violence since it takes place during a war and is suggest PG-13. The film and behind the scenes makes for a great introduction for a family discussion on how hard a war is on families.,1358121600,3,304,4.169491525423729
4911097,4,B005ZMBDWM,"It was a good story, but things happend so slowly that it was hard to stay awake to finish it.",1357603200,,94,3.75
4911098,1,B005ZMBDWM,"This movie is a Dog! Its hardly even about the dog.

I seriously cannot emphasize how bad the writing and acting is in the movie.  I do not see how this is about the dog either.  The other reviewers just had to be on something to rate it 5 stars.

Some of the settings are very beautiful,  and Louis Gossett's great voice, narration cannot even warrant me rating this any higher.

Save yourself!!",1330819200,4,396,4.3561643835616435
4911099,5,B005ZMBDWM,"This is a great story about a boy and his dog who escape a Southern plantation and go on an epic journey through the South as part of the Union Army in the Civil War. The story and settings are beautiful and it's a great way for kids to be introduced to American History. Also, the camera shots on this movie are amazing. It looks like a Steven Spielberg movie!",1330819200,2,361,4.171428571428572
8489816,3,B005ZMBDWM,The movie script was written for Jr. High students.  The acting was bad and the plot too simple.,1525392000,,96,4.333333333333333
8489817,1,B005ZMBDWM,"This movie never got off of that road to  hell that is paved with good intentions.  I wanted to like it for its positive message but I could only stand just a little over an hour.  Every basic element which makes up a good movie was abyssmal with the script, acting and direction being about as bad as I can imagine.  When you add in historical absurdities it seems more like a JHS class project than a commercial effort.  Many rated this highly and maybe you can overlook its many flaws, I couldn't.",1521590400,2,500,4.333333333333333
8489818,1,B005ZMBDWM,"Terrible movie. It has absolutely no basis in reality. The writing and acting are both on a Kindergarten level, if that. The actual story of Jack in the 102nd PA is amazing and inspiring. This movie however, is a total waste of time. Unwatchable!",1521158400,,246,4.613636363636363
8489819,5,B005ZMBDWM,Very sweet movie..  Highly recommend!,1506384000,,37,6.4
8489820,5,B005ZMBDWM,Good story line.,1484092800,,16,4.666666666666667
8489821,5,B005ZMBDWM,"wonderful movie.  gives thoughtful reflection into living history based on true life experiences our own civil war period.  sadly, war often involves brother fighting brother, cousin fighting cousin depending on which side of a line drawn into sand.  i done my own time in war in vietnam and what did see is still the same as in this movie.  a lot of events and emotions not thought of especially those who are so eager to throw such an event usually meaning someone, somewhere is making a financial killing while others pay in blood.  the richard cheney story comes to mind, since i did use to live in wyoming, usa.",1479168000,2,616,4.614678899082569
8489822,4,B005ZMBDWM,Good low-budget family film - beat expectations.,1469750400,,48,6.0
