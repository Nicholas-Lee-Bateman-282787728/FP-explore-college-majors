5253921,3,B00936GS26,"To my surprise, this is playing on Google Play for only 3.99 so I rushed to watch it...twice for that matter. I rather enjoyed it. I'd rank it pretty much on the same level as Assassination Games, JCVD's and Ernie Barbarash's other collaboration. Both movies were on the cusp of making the leap from being ""good"" to being ""damn good"". The script in AG is a bit stronger but JC does a much better job in 6B. He is in fantastic shape and doesn't sleepwalk at all through his performance. He looks and performs the best he has in years. The action is pretty well done and there is a good amount of it...even quite stylish at times. Like AG, Ernie gives us a really cool opening intro to the movie and JC kicks some serious ass in it. For the most part, 6B is shot really well, considering the budget. Acting wise, I thought everyone was above average for a DTV...with the exception of Bianca(JC's daughter). Even though she isn't in it that much, I thought her line delivery was just awful. Kris(JC's son), however, is better than usual. He still has a lot to learn but he didn't stink up the place like he usually does. Joe Flanigan was good and I liked seeing him in something other than Stargate. Neal Acree turned out another good music score, although, some of it may be a little too piano heavy which kind of kills the tone in a few scenes. It sometimes added a ""made for tv"" vibe but it was no big deal. Overall though, this is another good step forward for director, Ernie Barbarash, and definitely one of JC's best DTV's. I'll probably watch it one more time before it expires. 3.25/5",1346284800,17,1590,4.393220338983051

5253936,4,B00936GS26,"Jean-Claude Van Damme stars in another above-par DTV outing, and proves that he's still relevant (at least more relevant than Steven Seagal). There's nothing too special about the story, seeing as it's been done before in various forms (e.g., TAKEN). Even the cinematography isn't too unique, and has a washed-out palette that is all-too-common in these types of movies. But unlike TAKEN, this movie actually takes the time to develop its characters and give you reason to care about them. In other words, it's not all ass-kicking and one-liners (and in fact, there really isn't any humor). The run time is a little overlong (by about 15-20 minutes), but it's spent with characters you can identify with and a story that has some dramatic impact. Definitely for JCVD fans, but also for anyone looking to branch out beyond the middling action fare that Hollywood churns out nowadays.",1417910400,,882,5.006802721088436

5253941,3,B00936GS26,"Say what you will about Van Damme, but he's still a good action star.  In fact, in this movie he's about as buff as I've seen him.

The movie is so-so.  The story is much like Taken.  The action is much like Taken.  Even the relative location is much like Taken.  However, JCVD is a far better action star than Liam Neeson.

5253946,4,B00936GS26,"""6 Bullets"" may mark the end of (or at least a break in) Jean-Claude Van Damme's comeback: after a string of good roles and well-produced vehicles, he seems to be focusing on increasing weirder pictures, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Welcome-to-the-Jungle/dp/B00HVFA2VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Welcome to the Jungle</a>. Nevertheless, ""6 Bullets"" lives up to the rest of Van Damme's winning streak, being one of the better genuine action-thrillers of the DTV realm. Though it scrapes to earn these four stars and is a bit lite on actual action, the movie eventually earns its rating by skillfully balancing its adrenaline highlights with sound acting and an intriguing screenplay.

The story: a mercenary (Van Damme) is hired by a MMA competitor (Joe Flanigan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Atlantis/dp/B002EL4RLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Atlantis</a>) to rescue his daughter, who has been kidnapped by Moldovan sex traffickers.

""6 Bullets"" feels like Van Damme's take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taken/dp/B001TODCII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taken</a>, but it's not a lazy ripoff. Despite similarities, the movies don't follow the same path, with Van Damme's film not only favoring more explosions but also examining the consequences of collateral damage and giving the protagonist more allies to interact with. In regard to this last bit, Van Damme keeps up the dark and pessimistic energy that's served him so well since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JCVD/dp/B001PWY4NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JCVD</a>&nbsp;but gets balanced out well enough by Joe Flanigan's more vulnerable performance. Anna-Louise Plowman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>) also looks surprisingly strong as the wife of Flanigan's character, and Van Damme's son Kristopher gets the most room to act that he's ever received in his father's movies. Less impressive is that almost nobody in the film speaks any authentic Romanian, and listening to accented English for so long gets boring.

The screenplay is strong, or at least holds its own in keeping things adventurous and making Van Damme's allies more capable than the norm. Production values are equally smooth (DTV directors are uniformly figuring out how to make these Eastern European shooting locations look interesting). Surprisingly, even the musical score feels pretty inspired. All this film would need to be a decisively superior DTV feature is satisfying action content, and that's its shortcoming. Don't get me wrong, what's there is pretty good: the handful of shootouts are nice enough, and while Joe Flanigan's single hand-to-hand fight makes it obvious that he's not a genuine fighter, Van Damme accounts for this with a brutally sweet knife massacre. But beyond this, there's just not a lot of action: if just a bit of the shooting and fighting were eliminated, this could be played a straight thriller with almost anyone in the lead role. Say what you want about clichs, but if you're watching a Van Damme vehicle and the final scenes don't involve a martial arts showdown, you're watching an incomplete film.

""6 Bullets"" is a good vehicle for Van Damme in his quest for respectability: he can be a dramatic actor with depth and nuance, but still delivers juuust enough action to keep established fans in their seats. As a pretty dark movie, it's a bit of a relief that Jean-Claude is looking back into more fantastical fare, but it also presents a standard of quality that he should try to hold himself to. With his apparent zeal, I don't think it'll be too difficult for JCVD to do so, as long as he doesn't forget how much fans want to see his karate kicks. Give it a try, fans.",1403654400,3,3954,5.980565371024735
5253947,4,B00936GS26,"Pretty surprised at how good this was.  I thought the ""MMA fighter"" father was a pretty big pansy, but I suppose that might have been done just to show how hardcore Van Damme is compared to the average ""tough guy.""

Note that there is a lot more gun play than martial arts, so I knocked a star off because I want to see Van Damme busting some guys up instead of shooting them.  The few hand to hand scenes that were in there were done well enough, however.

This movie is a lot better than most of Van Damme's earlier movies.",1400371200,,525,4.1683168316831685
5253948,5,B00936GS26,I am a very big Van Damme fan and he played this  movie as great as he has all of others.  It was full of suspense and action.,1400112000,,126,3.4642857142857144
5253949,4,B00936GS26,"Yes it seems Van Damme did better acting in this movie due to probably a different, but better story. It was also built on a broader scale. The other supporting actors involved in this film played a well balance role also and the story kept moving right along. They both paired up great with Van Damme. I think without them in it, the film would've been a total flop.
The story is about him being a hired mercenary who is hired to find kids who have been put on the market for human trafficking. In short...he saves the day by killing or mangling the bad guys, rescues the kid and returns them to the owners. That was his profession.
After getting over a misfortune of a blundered mission, he recoups and has to assist the American couple who just had there daughter abducted too. This escalates on a serious scale and includes some good shootouts and normal martial arts fight scenes. I don't think I even saw a stunt double come in too long on some fight scenes.

This movie starts pretty good and builds, though I admit it falls apart at the end (kind of like what Stallone's been doing lately). Yes, yes, Van Damme WAS in Expendables 2.
Funny.
Well - I wouldn't trust Stallone to write ANY of his characters into anything appreciable anyway.

5253955,4,B00936GS26,"Movies like this appeal to our inner desire for justice. In the end, the bad guys just get shot and killed instantly. I wanted to see the villain get his fingers chopped off! Though I think having the daughter's pinky sliced off was a bit too much. They didn't need to include that in the movie (just my opinion). I also didn't think the scene with the girl melted by the acid was necessary. It may have been even more effective if they had left it up to the viewer's imagination. I'm not a fan of excess, gratuitous blood & gore. They probably could have toned down the nudity as well.

Other than that, I thought the movie was great. I'm a fan of JCVD, and this one didn't disappoint. It's good that they're bringing up the issue of human trafficking. Awareness leads to action.",1377043200,,780,4.379310344827586

Sure, some of it is poor quality, the girls could have been a shade better looking, they could've shown some nudity, and so on. Dealing with this theme a film maker probably should aim for an NC-17 rating and be a lot more explicit. Acting, too, could have been better. So what.

We have some decent action, and a good performance by Damme. The story line is similar to Taken. (Spoiler Alert)-But I think what hurt the movie for me was when out of nowhere the parents of the daughter who was kidnapped joined the fight at the end. We have an MMA Dad that says he never fired a gun before but shoots his gun like hes a pro, and the Mom who just happens to be an expert because her Father was in the military. This was just to convenient which I thought was a little cheesy and took away what was interesting about the film. And that was Damme's character trying to redeem his past failures. If the parents were forced to fight and had no choice, while Damme took all the bad guys out, that would have been a better ending.

5253965,5,B00936GS26,"6 Bullets is an outstanding entry into the JCVD pantheon of action films.  It reminded me a little bit of Taken (another great actioner), but 6 Bullets is a lot more brutal, at times devastating because even noble actions can have ultra devastating consequences for the innocent.  It has one of the all time great beginnings in an action film.  The acting is very solid, and JCVD really has come quite a ways in the acting department.  The production value and action suggested a larger budget film rather than a direct to video production. It would have been nice to see this film make a theatrical run in my opinion.  Long story short, JCVD plays an ex foreign legion type who is now a butcher in present day Moldova.  He is also known for another set of skills, recovering children kidnapped into the underground and illegal sex trafficking underworld.  He is emotionally scarred however, for certain reasons that I will not reveal.

 The daughter of an American family visiting the country is kidnapped and his services are called upon again.  The difference with 6 Bullets is that it does not take the easy way out, and the choices made have real consequences.  This is an excellent film that will stay with you for a while after you have watched it.  Highly recommended.

I really have enjoyed JCVD's latest line of films that really offer something out of the main stream.  Although many are lower to modestly budgeted, films like Assassination Games and the two newest Universal Soldier entries (Regeneration and Day of Reckoning) as well as 6 Bullets are terrific films, each standing on their own merits in my opinion.  Much better in my opinion than many mainstream films.  Thank you for reading.",1359504000,,1707,4.774744027303754
5253966,4,B00936GS26,"Six Bullets(released Sept/12)stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Samson Gaul,Joe Flanigan as Andrew Fayden,Anna-Louise Plowman as Monica Fayden,and others. Maybe you like I,when I first saw the title,thought the film may be about cops,or something to do with the underworld,etc. Well,this movie is about both those things,and more importantly,Van Damme and company take a close look at one of the most tragic human interest stories of our time;human trafficking. The opening begins with some phrases,which boil down to,and I paraphrase,""I once saw a person sold for six bullets...and did nothing"".This sets the tone of the film right off the bat. The film comes in at 115 minutes,give or take,and is a little on the long side,but it,for the most part,is a well moving and well acted drama. If you haven't seen the film yet,this is a spoiler alert.
The story finds JC as a butcher,an ex special forces man,in the country of Moldova. He has fashioned himself a very specialized side gig,that of retrieving young children from local gangs who sell them into slavery,usually of the sexual variety. As the film opens JC is in the process of liberating a very young boy. When he and the boy flee,JC creates alot of explosions and fireworks. Next day a local police detective asks JC to come over and view the mess he left behind. It seems the conflagration spread to the house where in turn the gang had hidden four other youths,who all perished in the resulting fire. All lay under tarps outside. The cop isn't too pleased and he would arrest JC if it wasn't for the fact that it was he who recommended to the family of the boy that they hire JC in the first place.
Along comes an American couple with a 14 year old daughter. The father is there for an extreme fighting bout. When they arrive a woman clandestinely takes pictures of the girl when exiting their cab. Later upstairs the girl goes out to the balcony to try and get better cell phone reception,and beside her on the balcony next door is the same woman with her camera. Dad has gone to take a shower and when he returns his daughter is nowhere to be found. He looks throughout the hotel,informing the hotel staff,but to no avail. The police are called and a man hunt begins for the girl.
Two days pass and there are no leads. The parents are at wits end and they obtain JC's name. They visit him but JC is in no mood to try and find anyone,anymore,after the debacle that recently occurred with the boy. The parents leave frustrated. JC gets a visit from a rep from the American embassy who also tries to persuade him. JC ponders the situation and is getting more and more visitations from two of the four fire victims(ghosts),in other words the ""guilts"".Finally JC relents and agrees to go on the hunt.
JC knows the usual gang involved and instead of poking at them piecemeal,he decides to go straight to the top man. He puts the squeeze on him,who in turn puts the squeeze on his underling;the man who did the actual kidnapping for him. He in turn visits the girl with the camera and her boyfriend,who is the man's cousin. When he tells them that the heat is on and they must close up shop the girl gives him a hard time. In an instant the girl and his cousin are dead on the floor. He has been carrying a can of acid,which he uses on another girl to fake the couple's daughter's death. To make sure he sells it to the parents,he buys off the coroner to tell the parents that the bodies DNA matches theirs.
The parents upon learning of the ""definitiveness"" of their daughters death,are beside themselves with anger;at the police and especially JC,who gets a firm slap on the face by the mother. JC and the American embassy employee go back to JC's shop,where JC is also beside himself with remorse. JC tells the employee it was his fault that he got involved in the first place,and the two part. JC goes to the store back and starts into no small amount of vodka to ease the pain. In walks the boss he previously put the heat on to retrieve the girl;and he has plenty of back up this time. They start putting a beating on JC to within an inch of his life. When they are just about to deliver the coup de gras,the embassy man enters and starts blasting away,which gives JC a chance to help. After the smoke clears,JC says that during his beating he recalled something strange. The bracelet of the couple's daughter was on the left wrist when the police found her,and it was supposed to be on the right. JC finds the couple at the airport about to leave and tells him what he knows. JC tracks down the coroner,who he chains up. Surprisingly it is the mother who gets a confession out of him,and the hunt is on once more.
They inform the police and between them and JC,the pressure is applied very hard to everyone that might know of the girls whereabouts. The girl is moved to a prison near the Ukrainian border,but an Arab arms dealer,who is the ultimate puppet master in this whole human trafficking scheme,is getting nervous. His name is apparently being linked to this mess and he wants none of it. He had already given the kinapper his notice,but this time it is settle it all within an hour or he would make sure it was himself. As he is now hold up in the prison with the girl,it becomes a defensive redoubt for the kidnapper and his men. JC and the couple travel to the prison,while the embassy man informs the cops who are also on the way. Using his skills JC manages to get past the security cameras. This is important as a swap goes off,in which the couple were to be killed by snipers,and instead it is they who go down. The girl they swapped is escorted back to the kidnapper who is about to shoot her,when she draws a gun given to her by JC,and empties it into the man. JC and the embassy rep see the couple off at the airport. The film ends as the arms dealer is seen in a Catholic Church and walking into the confessional. The dealer asks if God can forgive the most heinous of sins. The father,in reality JC,says God may,buy he can't. He kills him...fade to black.
The film has alot of good performances here,not the least of which is JC himself. The supporting cast is right on also. Watch for JC's siblings:Bianca as the girl with the camera,and Kris as the embassy employee,who even calls JC ""Dad"" on screen. The only fault here is the film's length. There certainly was a story to tell,and a good one at that,but it could have been edited more judiciously.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a good JCVD entry that should please most of his fans out there. Lots of action and drama here,with a story that few can not help but empathize with or at least appreciate.",1359331200,,6715,4.4735126324368375

5253968,4,B00936GS26,"...I was pleasantly surprised to see this movie morph into its own entity.

Jean Claude Van Damme's character, Samson Gaul, is a former mercenary who now dedicates his time to rescuing children who have been abducted by criminals who use these children as sex slaves in their underground businesses.

Now, at first, you may be thinking that the theme feels too much like the big screen blockbuster Taken - I know i did initially.  I believe, however, that the picture took off on its own path somewhere during the middle of the film.

Fight Choreography:  I found the fight scenes in this picture to be very well done and enjoyable to watch.  The fighting style portrayed by Van Damme had a very gritty, smash mouth, use your available tools at your disposal kind of feel to it.  I believe that this type of ""fight choreography"" is going to set the stage for a new era in action films.  There is also a bar fight scene where the father of the American girl who was kidnapped uses his mixed martial arts knowledge to take on a room full of men with bad intentions.  That was a fun couple of minutes to watch.

Believability: Van Damme did a pretty good job of making you feel something for his character.  You wanted him to succeed.  The actor who played the father also di a decent job.  You believed that he was a good father and that he wanted the best for his little girl.  The actress who played the wife, however, made her character come across as obnoxious and catty.  I think that the script required her to protray a mother who would have done everything in her power to get her daughter back.  So, when the mother grieves in a few of the frames during the middle of the movie, it's hard to feel for her when you are irritated by who her character is as a person.

Conclusion: All in all, 6 Bullets was a well done movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies with some good hand-to-hand combat scenes interspersed throughout.",1358640000,,1954,4.456338028169014

5253971,5,B00936GS26,"I rented this from redbox, curious to see what Van Damme was up to after Expendables 2. Since my teen years I have nourished a soft spot in my heart for him, and have followed all his films since the 90s. I was saddened to hear about his substance abuse issues, and hoped he would overcome these obstacles. After seeing S.Segall's latest B-release, I didn't have terribly high hopes for this movie, but was really pleasantly surprised by its quality on all counts, and so pleased to see JVD in the martyred-hero role that I love him best in. I prefer him as a tormented good guy to a villain, although he did make a nasty-hot-bad-ass in E2. The subject matter, child-sex-trafficking, was very current and presented in a very moving and non-cheesy way. Eastern Euro location; very evocative and cool. The script, editing, dialogue, character development were basically excellent. There is one beat'em-up scene set in the butcher storage area that is pretty macabre and very striking.  For a short film, the various character dramas were very well written and edited. Smashing job by the writers /directors, who really created an excellent vehicle for my darling Van Damme. Plus he spends a good bit of the movie without shirt or in tank top, and, well, when you just look so glorious, why not?  The fight scenes were tight and deadly, really kick ass. More please; a sequel, a series! I want to see Samson Gaul, the butcher and ex-merc of Moldova, rescue lots of other people.",1357516800,2,1475,4.735408560311284

5253975,3,B00936GS26,"Jean-Claude Van Damme is Samson Gaul, an ex-mercenary with a past, quietly living in Moldova as a butcher. When a daughter of a mixed martial arts fighter Andrew Fayden (Joe Flanigan) is kidnapped by a human trafficking syndicate, however, Samson once again stands up and fights to retrieve the abducted girl from merciless gangsters.

""6 Bullets"" is a solid straight-to DVD film from Jean-Claude Van Damme (who also executive-produced). There is nothing new about its story that is probably inspired by Liam Neeson's ""Taken,"" and action set-pieces are just average. This is a typical B action movie shot in Eastern Europe, and it works as such.

There is not much martial arts fight from Jean-Claude Van Damme, who seems more interested in doing serious roles these days - and I think he is pretty good at that - but Joe Flanigan does a very good job in one respectable fight scene. Also, Van Damme's real-life son and daughter Kristopher van Varenberg (as son of Van Damme's character) and Bianca Van Varenberg appear, but their roles are largely uninteresting.

Nearly two-hour film ""6 Bullets"" feels a bit too long. What the film needs most is a more menacing (or cunning) villain that could have made the film's story more thrilling. Directed by Ernie Barbarash (who worked with Van Damme for ""Assassination Games""), ""6 Bullets"" is a decent low-budget action film with an effective performance from the star Jean-Claude Van Damme.",1355875200,,1435,4.99581589958159

It's major problem is that it is way too unfocused for its own good; throughout the course of the film the focus wanders from the parents of the kidnapped girl to Van Damme's character, never quite sure who's going to be the hero, the mercenary played by Van Damme or the parents. Heck, by the end of the film they've even got the character of the mother choking a guy and toting a gun. Is this a Van Damme vehicle or is it another take on Bergman's Virgin Spring? Well, it's neither because it doesn't deliver satisfactorily on either counts, so it's ultimately just a classic example of mediocrity. Van Damme gives a good performance, but not his best. Flanigan also delivers a credible performance. This film is definitely a rental, though.",1348358400,,886,4.7973856209150325

Anna-Louise Plowman was adequate as the near hysterical mom who's not quite the shrinking violet you might expect, and Charlotte Beaumont was terrific as the daughter.

I am not saying I am a fan at all but if I had to choose between a new Val Kilmer, Dolph Lundgren, or Steven Segal movie after watching this one I would have to go with Van Damme. This is a movie where you pretty much know what your going to get going in and it doesn't disappoint in that sense. Nothing to run out and watch but in terms of movies starring action heroes who used to be famous this is not bad at all. I give it a B-.",1347321600,3,1116,3.986607142857143
5253999,3,B00936GS26,"I have been a fan Van Damme's for decades now and continued to followed him through his DTV years. DTV releases wise, I'm a fan of the Van Damme that appeared in Replicant, In Hell, Wake Of Death, Universal Soldier:Regeneration and Assassination Games.

For me, 6 Bullets falls short of these entries and I can't say it's Van Damme's fault. 6 Bullets comes from the same director as Van Damme's previous release, Assassination Games.

I can't fault Van Damme, he gives a very good acting performance as well as having plenty of well choreographed fight scenes and gets involved in plenty of gun battles. I did find the initial killings/assassinations (Van Damme plays a mercenary for hire) at the beginning to be a little to graphic/violent for me to the extent where it becomes to much to enjoy, if that makes sense. 6 Bullets runs roughly 93 minutes, Van Damme is present for about 60% of the running time but the movie feels longer.

The problem for me with 6 Bullets is the 40% of the running time that Van Damme is not on screen. Basically, the plot of the movie revolves around Joe Flanigan who comes to Eastern Europe for an MMA fight. His wife and daughter accompany him. His daughter is 'taken' from their hotel room and we learn that she is to be sold into the s*x trade. Van Damme gets involved in retrieving the missing girl.

When the movie follows Van Damme's character, I enjoyed 6 Bullets but when the movie switches perspective and we follow Joe Flanigan the father of the missing girl, and his wife for the other 40% of the running time, I found myself losing interest due to some unconvincing acting, a lack of likeability towards Joe Flanigan and what I felt was an utter scarcity in believability towards the Father and Mother characters in their actions

This is especially obvious in the last quarter of the movie which had my eyes involuntarily rolling around my eye sockets as the mother and father tool up and head off to take down the gang who have their daughter, once they located her. What annoyed me the most about this turn of events was that the very same couple berated Van Damme's character earlier in the movie for going it alone and not calling the police when he located their daughter and attempted to retrieve her.

As a previous reviewer stated, 6 Bullets is very similar to Liam Neeson's Taken but done on a cheaper budget  with some poor acting from the local actors and drafted in talent, with the exception of Uriel Emil Pollack who I had no problem with. The plot feels tired, the twists can be seen a mile away and the resolution is obvious just from reading the back cover. The same could be said for Taken, however Taken did it with style and energy.

If 6 Bullets had focused much more on Van Damme (who delivered in this what I was looking for in a good Van Damme DTV which is a realistic central performance, well filmed fight scenes and well staged gun battles) during it's running time or had a better actor than Joe Flanigan as his co-star, I would have rated this a solid 4 stars. As it is, I'd have to rate 6 Bullets as 2 and 1/2 stars. Consider renting before a blind purchase.",1347148800,3,3135,4.497363796133568
5254000,3,B00936GS26,"This is another teen abduction/ Eastern European sex trade/ rescue movie. Samson Gaul (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is the village butcher who moonlights as a mercenary. His accent varies throughout the film. His son (Kristopher Van Varenberg) who works at the US embassy, sends him clients.

When Andrew Fayden(Joe Flanigan), an American cage fighter's  daughter Becky (Charlotte Beaumont) is kidnapped, he calls on Samson who is reluctant to take the case. On his last case he generated a significant amount of collateral damage that wasn't as funny as when MacGruber does it.

The movie has a slight twist which really wasn't much of a twist. Monica Fayden (Anna-Louise Plowman) mouthing statistics in the middle of the film made me think this was a 93 minute public service announcement. In addition to beating up people, Samson uses elaborate high tech stuff. He is capable of setting up complex traps in a matter of moments. The movie ""Taken"" has set the bar for this genre and unfortunately this one doesn't measure up. Will work as a rental.
