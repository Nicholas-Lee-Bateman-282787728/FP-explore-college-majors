3939890,5,B002KD0OSI,"The DVD of Kings of Leon Live at the O2 is stellar - maybe one of the best concert DVD's I've seen anytime recently (and i watch a lot of this type of stuff on DVD).  It captures a great concert from June of 2009, from the ""Only By The Night"" tour, and the performance for the UK crowd probably kicked it up a notch, as they were much bigger in the UK, years before they broke big in America (despite being from here).  KOL gets better and better with each album, and I'm of the opinion that the latest album's songs are the ones that come off the best here (though that might be because this album is my favorite), but there's really not a bum track on the disc.  Hilights (for me) here include ""Molly's Chambers"", ""Closer"", ""Crawl"", ""Sex on Fire"", ""Use Somebody"" and ""Knocked Up"".  The cinematography is excellent - lots of really great angles, nice close-ups, and the editing is better than average in that they only go to fast-MTV cuts on the faster songs (one of my big criticisms of concert DVD's is that there is usually motion-sickness inducing fast-edits, but that's kept pretty much in restraint here).  I watched it on a big screen (off my projector) and there was very nice definition/sharpness to the image (not sure if this is available on Blu-Ray but the regular DVD looks awesome - i could see faces in the crowd clearly, on the shots from the stage) and the 5.1 sound mix is nice and clear (KOL's album engineers handled the mix on this too).  Generous running time - an hour-forty, 22 songs, no other extras, but I didn't care about that - the music/performance on this is SO GOOD, anything else would've just gotten in the way.  Highest recommendation on this DVD - if you're a KOL fan, this is a must-have.",1257811200,21,1726,4.425867507886435

If you just like ""Sex on fire"" take a look at previous albums, if you don't like 'em don't buy it because it has many old songs ... unless you want to know them or like the whole style of their music. Very recommended for older fans tho !",1291766400,,393,4.253333333333333
3939916,3,B002KD0OSI,"If you're a real fan of the band, you will probably like this DVD.  But as a casual fan, I found it a bit disappointing.  The lead singer seems to suffer through the concert rather than enjoy it, and because of all the close-ups of his face, this is a real distraction throughout.  But the sound quality is good.",1290556800,,312,4.254237288135593
3939917,5,B002KD0OSI,"What an awesome DVD!  From beginning to end, these guys ROCK.  I own every one of their cd's and these guys never disappoint. First of all, you're watching and listening to a first class band, then you've got the venue - the O2 London which is a huge indoor arena type of place and it was totally packed, not an empty seat anywhere.  Everyone was standing the entire time and sang along with every song.  These are the kind of shows I love watching on dvd.  You're definitely missing out if you don't purchase this today.  It's also great to play at parties, you can sit and watch or turn it up and everyone in the room can listen to the beautiful music while doing whatever.  It was worth every penny.",1287705600,,702,4.312977099236641

3939919,3,B002KD0OSI,I have also recently become a fan of Kings of Leon and love there music. Sex on fire was there first song I heard. The set list is great the footage is also quality but I was not trully impressed with the sound. I don't have a 10k system but denon 3805 110wx7 Infinity Interlude towers and matchin center. JBL rears s36 and JBL studio series tower. digital audio and hdmi connection. I have mp3's n my ps3 and streaming audio from Pandora that sound more clear that the Blu-ray audio of this disc. I also have other concert dvds with better SQ. Maybe I was just expecting more based on the reviews of the disc and my love for their music but this is my justification for 3/5 stars.,1281571200,2,681,4.246153846153846
3939920,4,B002KD0OSI,Must have for all Kings of Leon fans....I'm not going to make a huge deal about this Disc but it really cooks! The only problem with it is that I was not there. Enjoy!,1272931200,,167,3.9411764705882355
3939921,3,B002KD0OSI,"I really LOVE These guys and all their albums and was devastated to miss seeing them in person this last tour so you can imagine how exicted I was when they releleased this DVD.  I was out of town during the most recent arena show, but the reviews were just so-so from the local paper.  Well, now I see why.  There's NO interaction with the crowd and no extras of any kind.
The music is wonderful, the playlist superb, but they just seemed disengaged.  Were they jet lagged or stoned or what?!?  Nathan, the drummer certainly seemed bored enough.  Jared, the bassist was posing goofily and Caleb, the lead singer really killed w/ his voice, but his commentary was uncomfortable and minimal.
Matthew, the lead guitarist seemed to be having the most fun and really into it.  Wish he would have said something.
The crowd was great and you can tell they appreciated the KOL recognizing their longtime support by taping this in London.
I hope they're not getting jaded and taking their fans for granted.  (""Fans"" being one of my faves, btw)
Well, I hate be cliche, but I LIKE George Clooney, Target & KOL!  So sue me...
I still hope to catch them this summer.",1269820800,2,1154,4.536231884057971

3939923,5,B002KD0OSI,"Been a fan of The Kings of Leon for a few years... The they started getting big on the Radio... Haven't had a chance to see them live - but you can't ask for a better experience. Coupled with an HDTV, and 5.1(or higher) surround) its like being in front of them. The Track list is great, many of their greatest songs. The quality of the video is pretty good - its a little grainy, more so at some angles - I also have The Killers Live in London and its nearly crystal clear - I'm sure the difference comes from the location and their available lighting. Its not enough to dislike it though - it still gives you a closer look into the stage work of The Kings of Leon without getting smashed into the front guardrail floor level.

I gave my rating of 5 Stars because this live recording does give the viewer a great feel of a live performance, the sound is amazing, the video quality is pretty good, and the track list is full of great songs.",1266883200,,940,4.193370165745856
3939924,5,B002KD0OSI,This is a great DVD.  I've only gotten into their music in the last couple of months and this DVD was a way of learning some of their old and new songs.  A great purchase for the money.,1265760000,2,185,3.8421052631578947
3939925,4,B002KD0OSI,"I liked the London concert and love the sounds that KOL create but I've seen better concerts from home (on DVD). This isn't a discredit to KOL or they're concert style, venue, song selection, etc., I am a fairly new fan of KOL since the first quarter of 2009. I've bought their CDs but this is my first concert DVD. I've watched better concert DVDs though I still liked this one just didn't love it and I don't want to over sale it. I am satisfied with my purchase of this DVD and will be looking forward to a new KOL concert DVD or an existing one that I may not know about.",1265587200,2,575,4.097345132743363

3939928,5,B002KD0OSI,These guys are gifted musicians and song writers.  The only problem with watching this DVD is that the melody hooks are hard to shake from the brain right away.,1262822400,,160,4.517241379310345
3939929,5,B002KD0OSI,"I love these guys and am very happy with this disk. You know whether you're going to like this video or not before you buy it. If you're a fan of the band then it's a great buy; if you're not then why would you buy it? The performance is amazing! I bought this at the same time tat I bought Killers Live from the Royal Albert Hall and, while the O2 isn't as spectacular a venue this performance has a more intimate feel maybe because of it. The focus is definitely on the band and the music and these guys deliver.",1262822400,,514,4.049019607843137

If I could pay Amazon for extra stars, I would use those stars to give this disc 11 out of 5.

They have unique sound and all play together well . I don't like todays music in general but this is an exception . These young guys from Jackson Mississippi sound awesome .

3939934,4,B002KD0OSI,"The first time I saw Kings of Leon was here in Cincinnati in 2003 or 2004, playing a small club, and even then you could just tell these guys were gonne hit the big time sooner or later. Turned out to be sooner in the UK and later in the US. The band's grwoth, both musically and commercially, since that first time I saw them has been amazing. I was totally bowled by their 2007 ""Because of the Times"" album, which for me felt it was the band's great leap forward. 2008's ""Only By the Night"" was equally nice, but simply a continuation of the amazing breakthrough that was BOTT.

""Kings of Leon: Live at the O2, London England"" (22 tracks; 100 min.) brings the June 30, 2009 show at the O2 in its totality. Not surprisingly, two-thirds of the setlist comes from the last 2 albums, with OBTN getting 7 songs and BOTT getting 6 songs. The remaining tracks come of course from the first 2 albums. I was very concerned that the editing of the DVD would be headache-inducing, MTV-style (except that MTV doesn't play music videos anymore, but you get my point). While the editing is jumpy at times, it is quite enjoyable (and not the disaster some other recent DVDs have been, REM comes to mind). Additionaly the audio qiality is great, in particular if you have a home-theatre style set-up (which I happen to have), so crank it up! On the down side: the DVD has no extras whatsoever, none; also it would've been nice had they included a CD of this as well.

I saw KoL 4 times in 2007 in support of their BOTT album, but I ended up seeing them 5 times over the last year (Washington DC; Louisville; Cincinnati; Columbus; Lexington) in which I saw them explode from small venues on the early legs of the tour to arenas this Fall. (At a close to sold-out Schottenstein in Columbus, Caleb joked ""Last time we played here, in 2008, there were about 2,000 of you. We're happy to have all of the new fans too."") So when this DVD came out, I knew I just had to have it, if not else as a souvenir of seeing them 5 times in the last year. Now that KoL has crossed over into full-blown mainstream success, I will be really interested to see where the band goes from here.",1261008000,,2156,4.320987654320987
3939935,4,B002KD0OSI,"I have around 60 musical concerts on DVD, and I added this one to my collection today as an impulse buy from Best Buy. I've heard OF KOL, but I've never actually heard a song by them. Because of the name recognition, I decided to give this DVD a try since I know they are similar to other bands I enjoy. I'm glad I did.

Just so you understand where I'm coming from when reviewing this concert/DVD, my musical tastes include Sting (Police and solo), Billy Joel, Michael Jackson, Creed, Earl Klugh, Spyro Gyra, Bella Fleck and the Flecktones, Rush, Ray Lamontagne, Older Garth Brooks, Yes, Allman Brothers, Eric Clapton, Genesis, Norah Jones, Brian Eno, Chick Corea, Joe Satriani, Joe Bonamassa, Jeff Beck, and dozens of others. I'm also a keyboard player.

This DVD fits somewhere in between a few of the bands I'm familiar with and that I've enjoyed over the years. Musically KOL has some great guitar work, good drumming and good vocals. You can actually understand most of the lyrics, which I generally prefer. There is a lot going on in their compositions without too much repetition.

For my taste in concert DVDs (I like them to be filmed as if I'm there watching from different vantage points), the camera work is a 3 1/2 out of 5. I can't stand concerts where the camera jumps randomly from performer to performer, missing guitar solos. (I.E. Coldplay Live 2003) The camera work is pretty good here, and focuses on the performer during the solos and key parts of the song. A lot of crowd shots, but usually panning shots, which is pleasant.

Sound quality is pretty good (Anthem AVM20, Paradigm Signature 100's, AVM50, Servo-15, ADP's), and picture quality is average.

Most likely, if you lean a bit towards harder rock that doesn't get much air play, you'll enjoy this concert. The performance was good, if not just another good band playing for an audience. Nothing special about the stage presence of the band, just good music.

For those who care (I only do when my 3 year old is watching music with me) there is some language towards the end of the DVD when Caleb Followill talks about the price of concerts and thanks the audience for paying to see them.

Good stuff!",1261008000,5,2182,4.651948051948052
3939936,5,B002KD0OSI,"I bought the Blue ray version of the Kings of Leon live at O2. Now I truly know now why people buy Blu ray discs.

3939937,2,B002KD0OSI,I bought the Blu-Ray version hoping for a great performance with excellent audio and video quality.

3939938,5,B002KD0OSI,"I bought the Blu-Ray of this item and I can say that it looks and sounds amazing.  The filming is very well done.  I have seen Kings of Leon in concert a few times and this captures the show very well.  Rolling Stone gave this DVD 2 out of 5 stars and I could not disagree more.  Kings of Leon are sometimes criticized for not being as animated as some bands, but they always sound amazing and I think the music speaks for itself.  To think that they are ""phoning it in"" on some songs, like Rolling Stone claimed, is absurd.  What band is arrogant and stupid enough to phone in a concert they know is being recorded for a live DVD?  This has always been their style and you either like it or you don't.  By the end they are sweating profusely just like every other good rock band.  I say buy it, no fan will be disappointed.",1259280000,3,824,4.132075471698113

Before this, my favorite live concert DVD was U2 Go Home live at Slane Castle<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U2-Go-Home-Live-From-Slane-Castle-Limited-Edition-Packaging/dp/B0000TB050/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U2 Go Home - Live From Slane Castle (Limited Edition Packaging)</a>&nbsp;but this DVD is right on par. KOL was relatively unknown except for college play until the recent mainstream radio play of ""Sex on Fire"" but in my opinion one of the best groups and hardest working for quite some time. The band is made up of three brothers, and their cousin, from Tennessee but it is not country or southern rock. If you're looking for backstage commentary or behind the scenes buy something else. Nothing but good ole rock-n-roll on this DVD. They play a lot of the older music like California Waiting, Molly Chambers and On Call plus the new ones like Sex on Fire and Notion. It was hard to find anything to complain about but I did find one thing. Trani wasn't included. I gave it 5 stars only because I couldn't give it 4 and 9/10 because of the lack of Trani. Buy this DVD, turn out the lights, turn the volume up to 11 and wear this sucker out.",1258588800,7,1217,5.151515151515151
3939940,5,B002KD0OSI,"This is a great Kings of Leon Concert DVD, and it ROCKS!!! It was filmed on June 30, 2009, at the ""02 Colisium"" in London, before a capacity crowd of 18,000 screaming fans. It consists of 22 songs, and has an approximate running time of 100 minutes. This band was featured in the Rolling Stone, a few months ago. Their picture was on the cover. These brothers and cousin - Nathan Followill, Caleb Followill, Jared Followill, & Matthew Followill, were raised in the Southern U.S.A., and currently live in the Nashville area.

This band is currently one of the ""hotest"" rock bands in the world, and this concert dvd certainly proves why!!! This band has a unique sound, that is all their own. I don't think any other band could duplicate their sound. This concert features some of their songs from the ""Only by the Night"" Album Cd, along with some of their classics. Plus this band, is one of the best bands to emerge within the current decade. It's an original band with all original songs.

Don't believe the review of this dvd in the current issue of the Rolling Stone (they gave it only a 2 star, and they really didn't know what they were talking about.) This band gives it's all in performing before this 18,000 fan capacity crowd. There are no mediocre performances. This band performs extremely well on each and every song. They knew this was being filmed for a dvd. Their lead man Caleb Followill has some excellent interaction with the crowd. Plus, the crowd is really into this concert.

All the songs on this dvd were written by the band members themselves. The Key Tracks include: Use Somebody, Sex on Fire, Notion, Molly's Chambers, On Call and the Bucket. All the other songs are very good also.
