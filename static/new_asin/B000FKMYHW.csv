Best yet it will do the same in other direction from dvd to tape with one button and no need to finalize!

So anybody that thinks they can't work a dvd recorder buy this & you'll be so surprised it's easier then running your old vcr & with this model you'll have both to enjoy recording in either format.

I've converted all my old vhs tapes over to dvd est. over 400 & only takes about a third of space to store dvd's to them old vhs tapes!!

Last in case you didn't know the vhs tapes can only last 20 years where a dvd is est., to last over 50 years so which do you want to pass on to your children!!",1167523200,46,823,3.9397590361445785
