5967389,5,B00F4C0BVC,Pope John Paul I  excellent film.  surprised by quality of film and yes I did love it and highly recommended.  An overlooked Papacy but was predicted to be a short one by one of the children who witnessed the visions of the Blessed Mother at Fatima.  Jack & Nancy Doyle,1386633600,5,269,4.32

5967391,4,B00F4C0BVC,"""Pope John Paul I: The Smile of God"" is a surprisingly touching and occasionally hokey two-hour Italian miniseries (with English subtitles) on the ""smiling pope"" who died only 33 days into his reign in 1978. Italian comedian Neri Marcore shows real charisma as the warm, smiling, human, frail, and melancholy Albino Luciani both before and after his election to the papacy as Pope John Paul I. Marcore's performance is both simple and marvelous to behold: He manages to convey a hidden sadness and frailty beneath the mask of his constant smile and humble generosity in an extraordinary characterization, nailing the essence of Pope John Paul I with a skill that most of these papal biography films rarely achieve. I've seen a lot of these Italian TV religious epics, and many of the papal melodramas released by Ignatius Press on DVD in the U.S. (like ""Pius XII: Under the Roman Sky"" and ""Paul VI: The Pope in the Tempest"") are too hokey and relentlessly talky to hold one's attention very deeply, ending up as handsomely produced hagiographies with excessively fictionalized historical narratives that focus on hokey fictional subplots. This shorter film, like the Emmy-nominated 2005 CBS miniseries ""Pope John Paul II,"" is different in keeping one's attention riveted to the screen for most of its running time. Among many excellent scenes, my favorite was the surprisingly moving and whimsical sequence where Cardinal Angelo Roncalli (the future John XXIII) visits Luciani's diocese and tours its humble ministries with him. The natural affinity and friendship that develops between the two men in these scenes is palpable and helps explain visually why Luciani rose to the episcopacy under Pope John after being blocked many times before for health reasons. The conclave scenes are also good, and Luciani's personal touches as pope -- his refusal of aristocratic trappings, controversial public statement about God's motherly aspects, and endorsement of ""a poor church for the poor"" -- are captured here with an uncanny accuracy that unintentionally prefigures the current Pope Francis. Some English dialogue even pleasantly intrudes into the film, even reaching the point where Marcore uses a few English words when he meets the Irish secretary of his predecessor, suggesting a refreshing awareness on the part of filmmakers that English audiences may view this film. Finally, a particularly unexpected and intriguing highlight (given the usual avoidance of scandal or real tension in these sorts of films) is the depiction of Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, the Chicago-born priest who ran the Vatican Bank during its greatest scandals. Without subscribing to any conspiracy theories regarding Luciani's sudden death as pope in 1978, the film depicts Marcinkus as a shadowy figure who is clearly up to no good, manipulating stocks and transactions behind the scenes at the Vatican like a Wall Street capitalist. Cardinal Luciani's confrontation with Marcinkus over the Banco Ambrosiano scandal that impacted Luciani's charitable works is marvelously played by the two actors, with Mercore suggesting with his facial expressions that he knows Marcinkus is up to no good, but diplomatically ending the meeting when he realizes that further inquiry will get him nowhere. After Luciani is elected pope, this earlier scene pays off in a charming and unexpectedly subtle way when Marcinkus comes to offer his resignation in an apparent effort to escape any scrutiny for his actions at the bank, and the actor playing Marcinkus here barely conceals his disappointment when John Paul I requests a full report on Vatican finances rather than allow him to resign. This is really good stuff in a film that otherwise descends at times into hokey melodramatics. On the negative side, the film delights in legitimizing a dubious story (since denied by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, Vatican Secretary of State under Benedict XVI) that the Fatima prophetess Sr. Lucia dos Santos informed Luciani in a 1977 meeting that he would become pope and have a brief papacy. This cornball plotline, which starts out as an innocuous flashback device at the film's start, threatens to swamp the entire second half as the runup to Luciani's election as pope is needlessly protracted, with Luciani agonizing over his mystical conviction (presumably from Sr. Lucia) that being elected pope will end his life. This depiction of Luciani as a fatalistic believer in the destiny of his own demise is just plain silly, and it's in the latter half of this teleplay that Marcore's performance -- his makeup job is non-existent, making him look only 47 even though he's supposed to be 65 at the conclave -- wears thin and the film meanders a bit. A series of self-conscious scenes between Marcore and an actor playing Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, intrude at this point in an obnoxious way that feels forced and unnecessarily burdensome to the film's pace. But the film rallies nicely in its final 30 minutes, depicting some forgotten highlights of Luciani's brief papacy before concluding with the moving discovery of his death and stock footage of his funeral. The earliest parts of this film are also a highlight, but move so quickly that the editing feels excessively choppy, as if key transition scenes were cut from this DVD release. For example, this film cuts from two excellent scenes of Luciani as a boy discovering his vocation in a moment of peril and arguing it with his socialist dad straight to Luciani as a young priest without giving viewers any intervening context -- not even a title card explaining the passage of time -- and the film later cuts from John XXIII to Paul VI in a similar jump that leaves you scrambling to figure out that one pope died and another was elected. But in the final analysis, what stays with you here is the gentle and winning performance of Marcore, whose take on the frail Pope John Paul I manages to elevate the brief public career of this historical persona beyond the image of a one-dimensional plaster saint to that of a flesh-and-blood person. It's a great film and is well worth watching for Marcore's performance alone. In the crowd of papal biography miniseries, it's not outstanding, but it's quite informative and among the better productions.",1382227200,13,6277,5.107003891050583
5967392,5,B00F4C0BVC,"This biopic on the life of Pope John Paul I is interesting to say the least. Excellent acting, very good cinematography and an excellent story line. It does try very sincerely to capture the life and the very short reign of the man sometimes called the 'September Pope'.
This film begins in 1977 in Fatima, Portugal, where the then Cardinal Luciani is on pilgrimage speaking on the appartions of Our Lady of Fatima, when a message arrives that a nun in the convent in Coimbra, would like to meet him. This nun is none other that Sr. Lucia, the surviving visionary of the Fatima Apparitions. Perplexed, Cardinal Luciani goes and meets with her. Thus begins the story of the life of this humble man in a series of flash backs, taken from his teenage years in his little provincial town of Forno di Canale in Northern Italy; his call to the holy priesthood, his family life, his work as a parish priest, the impressions he made on his superiors and so on.

Notably, this film shows that this Pope was very much interested in reforming the curia and the Vatican bank. We also meet quite a few interesting persons in this film, namely Saint John XXIII, Pope Paul VI and Saint John Paul II.

One could question, what would have transpired had Pope John Paul I not passed away in such an untimely fashion? Untimely - merely a word that I choose, but everything lies in the ineffable will of God, which is Divine Mercy and Providence. Good seeds always bear fruit, and one will never really know what fruit has been borne by the seeds planted by this Pope.

The title of this review if from the movie, when Sister Lucia predicts the impending outcome of the then forthcoming conclave. Apparently this meeting actually happened!

Ultimately this is a film of faith, of devotion to family, friends, church and to the entire people of God, in the service of God, from a man who was a True Pastor, whom we can call  'The Reluctant Pope'.

This DVD is 120 minutes long in Italian, with subtitles in English and Spanish. It does not have any special features, nor scene selections, and does not come with the usual Ignatius press booklet on the film with study guide.",1381276800,26,2153,4.564766839378239

5967398,4,B00F4C0BVC,"Pope John Paul I: The Smile of God is another papal movie available from Ignatius Press, like Pius XII: Under the Roman Sky and John XXIII: The Pope of Peace. The biggest difference between Pope John Paul I and the other papal movies is that this one is in Italian with English subtitles. Had I read the description a little better, I might have avoided this film, because when I watch a movie I want to watch it, not read along, but I am glad I gave it a shot.

The biopic begins with Cardinal Albino Luciani (future Pope John Paul I) on a pilgrimage in Fatima, Portugal speaking about Our Lady of Fatima. He receives a message that a nun would like to meet with him. That nun is none other than Sister Lucia of Fatima. In their meeting, she keeps referring to him as Holy Father, even through he tries to correct her saying that she is mistaken. She then reveals to him that he will one day be pope. We then are taken on various flashbacks of Albino Luciani's life. We see a near death experience when he was a youth that made him want to become a priest. We see his father's initial refusal of him wanting to be a priest, but relenting when he promised to serve the poor if he became a priest. In the flashback of World War II, we see a juxtaposition of the gruesome reality of it all with Luciani's mercy shown toward a Jewish family hiding from the Nazis. There are also glimpses of his tutelage under the future Pope John XXIII.

Throughout this whole movie, we see Luciani's smile, both in good situations and bad situations. The actor, Neri Marcor did a wonderful job portraying why this holy man was indeed called ""The Smile of God."" While, this wasn't a complete movie of Pope John Paul I's life, it was enough to give you a glimpse at the significance of this man and his short papacy. I wasn't an initial fan of the movie being in Italian, but it grew on me. Church just sounds better and prettier in Italian for some reason. This is definitely a movie worth watching if you want to know about this recent, but largely overlooked pope.",1422230400,,2047,4.342036553524804

5967403,5,B00F4C0BVC,"Papa Luciani - Il sorriso di Dio (Pope Luciani - The Smile Of God) is an Italian film about the overlooked papacy of the late Pope John Paul I,whose reign lasted only 33 days after an untimely death. It also will always be remembered as the time that bridged epic papacies of both the late Pope Paul VI and the soon-to-be canonized late Pope John Paul II.Neri Marcor starred in this film by portraying the title role,also known by his birth name Albino Luciani and for his character traits such as his infectious smile,warm personality and humble pastoral style,together with a talented Italian cast.

Aside from his short papacy,the movie also dwells on his life from his childhood of poor and humble origins to his career as a priest,a life marked by deep faith and charity. It was later revealed that he was a protg of Pope John XXIII, who saw greatness and genuine holiness in him and a former Archbishop and the Patriarch of Venice. It also tells an interesting detail about his meeting with Sister Lucia,one of the visionaries of our Blessed Virgin Mary in Fatima,at Portugal when he was still a Cardinal. She told him that she a prophetic insight that he would become Pope and that his papacy would be very short. This scenes added intrigue to the viewers especially when the third secret of Fatima came into the picture and Luciani's reluctance to the papacy due to this said meeting.

Despite the many great things about this movie,one would definitely disappointed especially for conspiracy theorists who wanted some insight on his supposed murder and conspiracies surrounding his mysterious death. In addition to that,the topics about the Vatican Bank and Banco Ambrosiano were tackled only in passing with only a couple of scenes with Archbishop Paul Marinckus when Don Luciani met him twice - once as a Cardinal of Venice and the other as Pope. Also,the movie did not try to place new theories after it has firmly established that the Albino was indeed suffering for chest pains due to a not-so- healthy heart and that was the supposed reason why he is predicted to die early during his Papacy as predicted by Sister Lucia. In addition to that,the movie underplays the scene when Sister Vicenza discovered him dead during his sleep and that of the character of Cardinal Villot,accused by some conspiracy theorists of concealing facts surrounding the sudden expiration of the Pope and who has had personal disagreement with him. But nevertheless, placing a long final shot of the actor portraying him at the end of the film provides intrigue.

Overall,the film was more about what a great person the late Pope John Paul I is all about. People interested more on the mystery surrounding the his death have to look for them in other sources. Truly,Catholic viewers who wants to know more about this particular Pope though will never be disappointed in this surprisingly pleasant film.",1417824000,,2894,4.866125760649087

5967419,3,B00F4C0BVC,"I was very excited about the release of a Region 1 version of this film (titled ""Papa Luciani"" in the Italian original), with English subtitles, by Ignatius Press. But frankly, this was something of a disappointment. It is severely shortened and truncted from the original. Many scenes (some of them pivotal) are missing: Luciani's work as a seminary professor; the death of his beloved mother; his friendship with Cardinal Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII); his agonizing over church teachings on birth control; the importance of the Second Vatican Council; the opposition he faced from the curia in Rome when he became pope-- all of this is is missing, and the overall effect is a feeling of rushing through Luciani's life and papacy. Which is too bad, because this is otherwise a very nice film: beautifully produced, with a lovely musical score, and an overall excellent cast-- especially Neri Mercore in the title role. Besides the fact that he is way too tall for the role, Mercori captures Papa Luciani's spirit and persona perfectly: both his impishness, which earned him the nickname ""The Smiling Pope"", as well as the melancholy which underlay the life of such a gentle man in this harsh world. Most of all, Mercori captures Luciani's deep and profound humility-- the lasting contribution of this good and holy man of God to our age. (Even this truncated film should open the eyes of even casual observers to similarities between Pope John Paul I and our present Holy Father, Pope Francis. In sum, a film too short for a papacy too short.",1388966400,14,1547,4.885931558935361
