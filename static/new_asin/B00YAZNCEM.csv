7210795,2,B00YAZNCEM,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I should have known what to expect from QUEEN CRAB when I realized it was directed by Brett Piper, the guy responsible for 1990s A NYMPHOID BARBARIAN IN DINOSAUR HELL.  My friend Joan and I rented that one years ago as a joke for a Who Can Find the Dumbest Movie Contest, and it came in second place.  So, I honestly should not have been surprised by what QUEEN CRAB had to offer.  Still, Im a sucker for just about any creature-feature, so I gave it a look.  Unfortunately, the ninety minutes I devoted to this film would have been better spent cleaning my bathroom or doing just about anything else at all.  The stop-motion special effects were decent, but they're not enough to save this bomb.

I realize this film is meant to be a sort of homage to the giant creature films from the 50s and 60sand if it was meant to be a comedy, ok fine.  But I never got the feel that it was.  Theres too much seriousness in it to be a comedy, and as such, the movie fails on almost every level.

The primary component that kills QUEEN CRAB from the start is the super low-budget quality the film has from the opening scenes.  This is a huge contrast from the DVD cover and the opening credits; both sucker the viewer into thinking this is a bigger-budget movie that will entertain and thrill.  But when the opening credits end and the movie starts, the opposite becomes evident very quickly.

The film quality looks as if the production crew used an old VHS camcorder to shoot the movie.  This could be overlooked if it was done to make the film look old, however thats not the case.  The movie is set in modern times but simply looks cheap and crappy.

Likewise, the acting in QUEEN CRAB is absolutely horrible.  This is the second nail in the proverbial coffin.  I wanted to overlook it, but theres no way to do so.  Aside from the fact the casting decisions were terrible, the people (I cannot call them actors) who fill the roles cannot act to save their lives.  Again, if this was intentional, it might lend a bit of offhanded charm to the filmbut again, its not done on purpose.

The only somewhat saving grace for this film is the stop-motion effects used for the crab.  These  actually looked pretty good, and they were blended in with the film fairly well.  But, even so, this isn't nearly enough to save the film.

QUEEN CRAB is a definite No for me, and I cannot recommend it at allunless you are looking for a cheap creature-feature that will annoy you instead of making you laugh.  Im not sure what vision director Brett Piper had for the film, but I doubt it was this.  The film is available today if you want to give it a look.",1443484800,7,2705,4.347305389221557

7210798,2,B00YAZNCEM,"****Please see comments below. I have been mistaken in my commentary about the special effects.****

I watched this movie with an open mind and understanding that it is low budget and not meant to be taken too seriously. Even so, there are quite a few problems.

The story is simple enough. It's about a young girl, who doesn't exactly love her parents, who ends up being orphaned after her scientist father accidentally blows up the house. A crab ends up growing to be a monster and the girl develops a psychic bond with the crab that lives in a pond by her house. The sheriff supposedly raises the orphaned girl. The girl seems to be able to do anything she wants, including shooting the deputy in the butt and suffers no consequences. This was probably an attempt at humor but it doesn't quite come across that way. The girl seems like a spoiled brat (she is living off her inheritance) and is a man hater so she comes across as a very unsympathetic heroine.

The CGI was pretty good for a movie of this budget. I have no complaints about special effects with the possible exception of the ending. BTW..I don't want to give away the ending but they sort of botched it at least as far as the plan goes.

Supposedly this movie was paying homage to old sci-fi flims of the 50's (which I'm a big fan of), Tarantula comes to mind,  but if so, it fails in that regard.

The acting is very poor. I'm not sure if they are working for next to nothing or nothing at all but they must be. From watching the trailers that are in the extra's I notice the same actor's and they are not very good. Not the worst that I've seen but I don't know why you would keep hiring the same actors that really aren't adding anything to the picture.

Sometimes you take bad acting in order to add some eye candy but this is definitely not the case here. It's especially surprising to see that the producers couldn't even come up with a girl who would take their clothes off. I'd understand if they had a star who had some selling power but they have an unknown playing the part. In a day and age where there must be a million girls who would gladly remove their clothes for a starring role in just about any movie, they have a girl wearing a nude body suit. Of course it's possible they wanted to go with no nudity. But why would you go that route in a monster movie that is not rated? And why was she ripping off her clothes to dance naked around the pond anyway?

You'd think they would probably want to save some of the crab eggs or even preserve the Giant Crab for scientific reasons...but then again...they never did that in the movies in the 50's either.

Perhaps some of my questions will be answered in the sequel!",1457136000,5,2697,4.324752475247525

7210802,3,B00YAZNCEM,"Melissa (Michelle Simone Miller) grows up befriending a giant crab that lives in her pond. When the crab lays eggs, things become a problem for this small western New Jersey community (note license plate and mountains).

The film is a Polonia Brothers production which surprised me since John had passed on in 2008. Apparently Anthony Polonia, a make-up artist is part of the act. The Polonia brothers were infamous for bad films with long boring dialogues and unrealistic rubber headed monsters. It seems now utilizing CG we have gotten away from rubber heads, but everything still looks fake. The acting has picked up from  ""F"" to ""D-"" at least it is moving in the right direction. Their films have a more professional look to them as far as sound, camera angle, and ceasing using Super 8 film.

Terrible fight choreography. Looks like slow motion with no one landing a punch. Look out Sonny Liston.

Queen Crab is a low budget SyFy type of film. Not for everyone. In fact, not for most people.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. At one point it appears Melissa is dancing nude. but it is filmed at a distant and she is wearing a nude body suit.",1446249600,2,1149,4.640394088669951

7210804,2,B00YAZNCEM,Not the right description. I think this film is trying to be like the old Sci-fi movies of the past. As a previous reviewer mentioned no meteor and no centuries old plot line. I almost felt as it were a bait and switch situation. The crab is actually friends with the girl and they seem to have evolved some sort of telepathic link. Movie has some killing but no over the top gore. Probably not a movie I would recommend unless you're really desperate for the nostalgia of the 50s.,1444176000,,481,4.355555555555555

I watch a movie on YouTube called Island Claws made in the 60's about a giant crab and it is 10 times better than this

As a screenplay writer for Vimeo/Youtube director Frank Stamm, Im judging this film by the same standards Id grade a low-budget project I was involved in.

While watching a slew of low budget horror and sci-fi movies recently (all reviewed on Amazon) I saw the film Muckman (2009) -- a team-up of Pennsylvanias low-budget twin-brother directors the Polonias (one of the brothers is now deceased) and low-budget director & special effects mastermind Brett Piper.  The film was lacking in a number of ways -- but it had cool old-school stop-motion effects, and also had a little T & A. It was a good time overall. After seeing it, I was compelled to search out one of Brett Pipers more accomplished films Shock-O-Rama (2005), and one of his more notorious A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell (1990).

Piper is capable of filmic romps with scantily clad women (good), old-school Ray Harryhausen effects (good), and very meandering scripts (not so good). Muckman and Nymphoid Barbarbarian fall into this category of film. Piper can also pull a Shock-O-Rama out of his hat, which was a well scripted horror anthology film.

Which brings me to Brett Pipers new film Queen Crab. Its very much of a piece with Muckman. Queen Crab is also a Polonia/Piper team-up, with Mark Polonia producing and Piper again directing. Unlike Muckman, Queen Crab does not have that one good actor who helps elevate the proceedings, as Muckman had  A.J. Khan -- so the acting is somewhere between poor and passable. It also doesnt have the T & A that Muckman had. What ""Queen Crab"" does share with Muckman is some great special effects courtesy of Brett Piper. The special effects really begin in full about halfway through the film, so you have to stick it out to that point.

Id give the film 3.5 stars  what I consider a good grade for a low-budget film.",1486425600,,1843,4.773584905660377

8718047,4,B00YAZNCEM,"As a long-time reader of Guy N. Smith's CRAB novels (look 'em up!) and a lifelong devotee of stop-motion animated monster movies, I had a lot of fun with QUEEN CRAB! Brett Piper has been steadily making his own stop-motion animation/live-action sf/horror/fantasy movies since MYSTERIOUS PLANET back in the early 1980s, and I'm as much a fan of Piper's films as I am of anyone's, and QUEEN CRAB is one of Piper's best recent works. His means are meagerno major studio has ever or will ever grant Piper the funding necessary to up his game to the standards of mainstream movie-goersbut his heart is forever in the right place, and his stop-motion skills are right up there with Phil Tippett and their mentor, Ray Harryhausen. QUEEN CRAB tells the tale of a young woman and her devotion to a crustacean that has a soft spot in its shell for her, too; this is a slice of American grass-roots filmmaking that I for one savor. Entertaining, enjoyable, and terrific fun; check any expectations and just go for the ride.",1465862400,10,1012,4.691011235955056

8718049,4,B00YAZNCEM,"In Crabbe Creek, a small rural community, a young girl named Melissa adopts a precocious crustacean she names PeeWee. As it happens, her distracted dad is a scientist working out of a home laboratory, attempting to increase the size of fruits, vegetables and livestock, in hopes of combating world hunger. Ignored by her bickering parents, little Melissa starts feeding PeeWee some weird berries from her daddy's lab...

Jump ahead about fifteen years, and Melissa's folks are dead, thanks to an unfortunate laboratory explosion. She lives alone in a cabin on her family's property, a virtual hermit. At night, the nubile young woman (Michelle Simone Miller) communes with her pet, now named ""Goliath,"" and about the size of Sherman tank. Unfortunately, Goliath spawns a hungry horde of crawling killer offspring, and it's up to Sheriff Clarke (Ken Van Sant), his obnoxious deputy (Richard Lounell) and an investigator from the state Wildlife Commission (A.J. DeLucia) to save the town from the mighty Goliath and her voracious crablings.

Shot on digital video with a tiny budget, QUEEN CRAB is a fun little monster movie that hearkens back to 50's sci-fi programmers, with a light tone, frequently witty script, and Old School special effects. The crabs are created via the magic of traditional stop-motion animation instead of CGI, executed with skill and style by Piper himself.

The performances from the cast of semi-pros and amateur actors are inconsistent, to say the least, ranging from campy to wooden, but Piper's direction is brisk, and the creature effects are a genuine delight.

Wild Eye Releasing's DVD is terrific, with a flawless, 16x9 widescreen transfer and Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. The sound mix is admittedly underwhelming, with some brief instances where dialogue levels drop sharply, but overall, it's satisfactory. Jon Greathouse's musical score is mixed well, and is quite effective. The generous supplemental features include an audio commentary by Piper and producer Mark Polonia, a gag reel, three behind-the-scenes featurettes, an assortment of Wild Eye trailers, and a preview of Piper's next movie, TRICLOPS.

QUEEN CRAB isn't a movie for everyone - the cheapness of the production is always evident and that can be hard for more cynical viewers to overlook - but it has a ""let's put on a show!"" earnestness that can be endearing, if approached with an open mind. Recommended.",1465171200,4,2408,5.227979274611399
