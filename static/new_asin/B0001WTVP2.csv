8017122,1,B0001WTVP2,"I had ordered this dvd set many years ago and try'd to sell it off but one of the disc is majorally scratched and they wouldnt take it so i got stuck with it. After 12yrs. or so now i decided to give this movie half a chance and watch all 4 of the films. I cant say much good about any of them cuz none of these programs lived upto its title on the cover. Alot of class act horrible acting and offie music that isn't even bar able to hear or watch in that matter. However since this is a 2-disc double sided i kept them in a book and never even bothered to look at them until today. Im on the malibu beach vampire one and that is by far the worst one on this set so far. I don't know what people think when they make these kids of money, im a fan of low budget horror films but this is ridicules. I don't know how anyone can buy this and be satified paying yhe $10 or whatever the price today of it is. I cant leave any positive feedback on this sadly to say but who cares....skip this one trust.!",1497830400,,997,3.868292682926829

8017124,1,B0001WTVP2,"First off, I have not seen this, so ignore the 1 star rating (a rating required for posting)

I believe the problem here may be that this is linked as a ""Better Together"" and is linked to a show from Nick, leading people who don't read the information regarding this title to think it must be the Nick show, and not what it really is.

Please take the time to read the product descriptions, but also, Amazon, perhaps you should check that sort of thing before you offer a ""Better Together"" option. This should be linked to some other horror movie, or not at all, but not with the Nick kid-friendly show ""Clarrisa Explains It All Season One"".

I hope this can help prevent problems like this from occurring...",1141603200,4,708,4.4728682170542635

I seen this pop up while I was looking for my childhood show and I said oh I wonder what this is. I knew instantly that it was not the TV Show. So if you bought this item that's too bad but it was your own fault not whoever put this page together.",1131062400,12,404,3.6551724137931036
8017126,3,B0001WTVP2,"To the person below who mentioned how this product is misleading...since when did the infamous show ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" deserve a rating of R, when after all it was originally aired on the friendly, kid targeting network, Nickelodeon???",1130889600,7,245,5.0
8017127,1,B0001WTVP2,"This product was very misleading. After having read the previous review from Doug Funnie, I naturally assumed that this was a selection of episodes from ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" which is a television show that was on the air a few years ago on Nickolodeon. My sister and I used to love that show, so we thought it would be a great idea to buy it on DVD, so we bought this product, thinking that we were ordering our favorite childhood show. Unfortunately, what we received was a compilation of several horror movies that we'd never heard of all converging under the title ""Afraid of the Dark."" While we were able to return it, we still lost the cost of shipping as well as our hopes of having the TV show on DVD. So if you are looking for ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" don't order this product, because it's not what you're looking for.",1127952000,24,841,4.329113924050633
8017128,5,B0001WTVP2,"I watch this show day and night. I don't sleep, not because im scared (not that its not scary), but that I just love the show so much, that, as Steven Tyler says' ""I don't want to miss a thing"". Anyways, enough about me, lets get onto this show. Having this on DVD has changed the way people watch the ""Re-wind collection"". It has changed my life, changed my wife's life, and changed my marriage for good. Im serious, these scary moments from the show have made my life and I realize how much we mean to eachother. Seriously guys, its a good therapist. I love how at the end of the show, they poor the bucket (still don't know whats in the bucket) to put out the fire. My wife and I have spent millions of dollars trying to find out what is in the bucket. If you know, please comment. Alright, well im out of here for now, just figured I would leave a lasting impression, because the last guy that left a message was in a really bad mood. I don't think he has even seen the show, not the mention the episode when the real house turns into a doll house. That was really scary. I have trouble going into houses now. Anyways, Nick, great job at your show, hopefully you can bring in back to television. I LOVED IT!

This is no Comparison whatsoever. I wouldn't take this DVD for nothing. File in circular container. Chris Barbay",1119571200,15,257,4.608695652173913
