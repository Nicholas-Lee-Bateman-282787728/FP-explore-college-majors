8521143,5,B007R3A2UQ,I was lucky enough to be able to attend the screening for these two episodes and I loved it! These guys keep stepping it up with every episode. I love how these characters are evolving and not since QAF have I been able to get into another gay drama. I hope to see BoysTown around for a long time. The show is shot beautifully. Kudos to Ricky for bringing the show back after all these years!,1338595200,,392,4.171052631578948
