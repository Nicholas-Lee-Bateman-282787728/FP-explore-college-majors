1384843,5,B0000507PF,"I've always had a secret desire to bellydance but thought it would be too hard to learn.  I bought this tape on a whim and loved it - not that it isn't hard for me to feel coordinated, but Neena and Veena demonstrate the moves so clearly that anyone can pick them up!  My next purchase was the Basic Dance moves.  I found that without the first tape, I would have given up right away. With a little more practice, I'll be ready to move on to the rest in the series.  It's fun and it's a great workout.",1015632000,4,501,4.03030303030303
1384844,4,B0000507PF,"I started bellydancing with Veena and Neena's ""Sensual Art of Bellydance"" series in August, and started taking weekly classes in October to get even more bellydancing. This workout tape is really very good. I find that I get a reasonable workout (I'm not exhausted after, but I feel well worked out), and I am actually finding that my bellydancing is better as a result! This tape is helping me to become better at isolating my various body parts (even the 'genie bounce' does this), and I'm finding new muscles appearing. I would have liked to have seen some footage of the twins dancing - with that, the video would have been a 5 star.",1012608000,,637,4.5964912280701755
1384845,5,B0000507PF,"I love this video. It's a lot of fun, it never gets boring, and you get a good little workout in 30 minutes. It's good for most fitness levels, and the little bellydance moves incorporated into the workout - hip bumps, shimmies, etc... - give it some pizzazz though I'd say it's more of an aerobic video with some elements of bellydance thrown into the mix. But it does work everything, from the legs to the arms and in between; it's just a great all-over workout. If I'm in a hurry and want a quick workout and a pickmeup, I do this tape and feel great all day.",1011916800,,562,4.212962962962963
1384846,5,B0000507PF,"I really enjoy this as an exerceise routine, it took me only 2 times trhough the video to have the moves down and I always feel wonderful afterwards, plus it works up a great sweat and the twins are beautiful and lovely to watch. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, low impact and non-stressful way to keep or get into shape. I also recommend their hips, buns and thighs, and their fat-burning video which in my opinion is the most work.",1009929600,2,447,4.333333333333333
1384847,4,B0000507PF,"This video really helped me strengthen my abs, arms, and lower body. I have tons more energy than I used to. However, in order to truly make it LOOK like I had slimmed down, I had to stick to my usual  workout of cardio and strength training. And no, I could not quit doing the traditional crunches and twists! :-(",1009497600,5,314,4.233333333333333
1384848,5,B0000507PF,"I went looking for something exactly like this.  I've been dancing for a few years off and on.  I never seem to get past the basics because I can never get physically fit enough to practice them.  I've tried yoga and areobics, but they never kept my interest.  This video is perfect, the moves are a few steps past the basics so I feel I'm learning something, but more importantly its a nice workout that I expect to keep with.
I would definately suggest that this is the last of the videos in the beginner series.  I have not yet tried the others (but have them ordered).  For a true novice, this is not the right video to start with ... try the basic moves from them first.
The only side comment, the music is egyptian style, and if you are use to dancing to heavy drums, AND are a bit tone deaf (like me), the music takes a bit to get use to.

1384850,4,B0000507PF,"This is a nice cardio-workout. It is not the most difficult but in 30 minutes you definately work up a sweat. It might be good to review basic moves before this video.
There is a warm up and a cool down. The actual work out leaves my shoulders feeling tired (I am only into this about a week.) just like when I was learning veil work. It also helps you to learn to isolate and combine some moves -- which can be helpful!
I think the quality of the video is pretty good. However I think their sensual belly dance videos are great! This is purely for the workout value not for dance. Look for the others if you are wanting to learn a dance.",1003104000,4,638,4.112
1384851,4,B0000507PF,"Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down is not the hardest cardio workout you will ever do.  That said, the exercise contained in this video is enjoyable for anyone, and a great addition to a regular workout routine.  I think it would be enjoyable for any fitness level; from an introduction to cardio exercise for a beginner or as a recovery day for an intense exerciser.
The video starts with a warmup period where you begin to isolate different muscle groups, including abs, hips, and muscles.  This continues for approximately five minutes, and then the workout moves into the cardio portion.  This involves various dance movements interspersed with the genie bounce, a side-to-side sway using the arms.  You can take this section at your own pace.  By the end of the workout, which includes a cooldown, you feel that you have really exercised - and don't even notice it while doing the routines!
Something to note is that the vocal instruction is done using a voice-over.  It is somewhat different than other workouts where the instructor is the one yelling from the tv!  The sisters just do the movements, with a mysterious smile the entire time.",989280000,11,1156,4.892307692307693

1384882,5,B0000507PF,"I've been doing this routine somewhat inconsistantly for almost a year, and I still love it!  It's a little cheesy sometimes (""how are you doing? ... you're doing good."" I just say it along with her and laugh now), and could really use better instruction- there are times when the girls will be doing two things at once and the camera really only shows the one part, and the voice over lady is either counting or not saying anything at all, and all of a sudden you realize, ""wait... are they moving up and down right now too?"" and THEN the camera zooms out so you see that they are, and voice over lady tells you to bend your knees and move up and down.  Thanks.  That's helpful now that we're moving on to something else.  So the first couple of times through, it can be a little frustrating, but hang in there because once you get it, it's a LOT of fun!  It keeps me smiling the whole way through, and I really work up a sweat!  All in all, a great purchase!  When I get on my little kicks and start doing it a few times a week, I can really tell the difference!

1384886,2,B0000507PF,"short version: Product works if you use it. The music is wonderful and even you, yes you, the one that has no rhythm. Even you will start to intuitively/instinctively move to the music. It'll take a few times, but you'll be a natural in no time. Buy Basic Moves + Fat Burning if you want to get moving with bellydance moves and are completely new to the idea of dancing to lose weight. Buy Arms, Abs, Hips, Buns, Thighs if you are a little more familiar to the concept. Buy both if you want some variety. Do not buy any if you are respectably in shape or you not a beginner to bellydance. Do not buy Slim Down.

Long version:
When I bought this, weighed at least 298 pounds (135 kilos). I had seen a late-night infomercial for some sort of dancing for fitness thing. Anyways, since then I've lost 50 pounds so far and I have another 100 to go (23 kilos lost, 46 to go). I want to share that with you to brag a little bit, but also more importantly show that when you eat right and use this DVD, you WILL LOSE WEIGHT.

I was extremely out of shape from desk jobs and I wanted to do something fun and not feel embarrassed at a gym like Curves, but also low-intensity so I didn't feel like dying after two minutes. My very first time following Slim Down was about the 20th time with the twins' video (I had been using BM+FB and AAHBT up to that point). I sort of followed along, but the narrator was very different than the other two videos and it really killed it for me. She makes the workout a horrible chore instead of a fun dance session. I've owned this DVD for three years, and I've used it about five times.

'Slow Down' is medium/high-intensity exercises based off of bellydance for your whole body. There is plenty of bouncing. My fat rolls can't handle it and neither can my ears. Obviously, you should know that this is for more healthy-ish people who need to shake up either routine but also aren't in super shape either. You will not learn how to bellydance, per se, but you will definitely feel like you are.

The narrator's voice is irritating and it is not either of the twins. You can turn it off if you want. The narrator is extremely 'exercise-y' about it compared to the other videos. By that, I mean she is continuously repeating the numbers of the reps and things like that. Since the twins do not speak throughout the video to explain moves or motivate you, you will either love or hate this. Basically, the narrator is there is keep you motivated to complete the workout but she's really bad about it. I did find that about my sixth time of working out (different video), I then had some muscles and those muscles realized I had been doing half the workout in a bad/lazy way and then I really felt the burn one I self-learned the right way to do it. If you have a full-length mirror you could pause and compare I guess.

I lost weight (~20 pounds) and built muscle over two months with this through exercise alone (totally was still eating garbage food). Girly muscle is great, being ripped is not! I stopped caring though and gained it all back. About two years passed and then I renewed my determination to be healthy. This time I've lost about 50 pounds and I'm still not tired of BM+FB and AAHBT bellydance videos.

Since I own all three, this next part is to compare this one to the other two. I do not use this one (SD) at all. The moves are still too fast-paced for me and I can't stay motivated without that mellow voice like on the other videos. It falls into the 'too fat for it' like Fat Burning of BM+FB. I've tried to follow along because I paid for it, but it's too much. I only played Slim Down with her voice turned off and unfortunately, without a mellow voice to keep me going, I quit before I'm tired. I do Arms, Abs, Hips, Buns, Thighs 2-4 times a week and it is a little more 'workout'. It has some more focused exercises compared to Basic Moves. In other words, BM+FB is closer to actual bellydancing than the AAHBT video. I still have been unable to complete Fat Burning of BM+FB; I'm still 100lbs. overweight and there's some intense jumping/bobbing moves in it and my fat rolls just can't handle it. So in my opinion, I'm only got half a video with content I can't use yet. I do Basic Moves 2-4 times a week.

You can search for these videos on YouTube and they have been uploaded in ten-minute intervals. I am unsure though if Slim Down is still available. If you like what you see, consider the purchase. I am grateful that I purchased BM+FB and AAHBT. I do recommend them (but not this one) to others. However, you might find this easy or boring if you are doing fast-pased workouts like calisthenics.",1364774400,3,4651,4.332950631458094
1384887,5,B0000507PF,"Great video, I love the music in this video.  Great moves!  However, warm up before completing the entire exercise, since there will be a lot of use of the ankles and legs to move those hips.

1384889,5,B0000507PF,"This DVD is a great mix of belly dancing and aerobics, making it a ""classic"" that you'll find on most serious belly dancer's shelves.  You will burn lots of calories and learn a few new moves all while trying to decide which twin is cuter.  What fun!  While this DVD is only 30 minutes long, your body will be well-worked.  If you are still hungry for more, there is a bonus performance and an 8 minute flexibility workout under the special features.  The moves are easy enough for beginners and the pace is quick enough to hold an advanced dancer's attention.  While this DVD won't teach you a new routine or sharpen your technique, it's fun and gives you a great belly dance workout--something a lot of DVDs promise, but this one delivers.",1363564800,3,741,4.533834586466165

But it's definitely a fat-burning workout, the leg work is killer!  I do find the narrator asking ""how are you doing"" irritating and I hurl obscenities at her everytime she asks :)",1358899200,,331,4.306451612903226
1384893,4,B0000507PF,"I like this workout...in fact, my calves were screaming the day after I did this workout for the first time. It's great, gets your heart rate up, and it's interesting enough to keep my attention. It also makes exercise fun and interesting.

However...it is very difficult to follow. They do not slow down to show you the first repetition of a move...in fact, they don't slow down the entire DVD. It's very much fast-paced, and if you don't understand what they're doing (because either the camera isn't on their legs when they should be, the voice-over instruction is confusing, or maybe you're just a slow learner), you're pretty much out of luck.

If you're okay with doing this video about 4 or 5 times before you finally understand the correct way to do the steps, then I'd say go for it. I'm still keeping this video because I don't mind going through it several times (Hey, I burn calories either way, right? I don't have to look perfect to burn calories!), and also because the video is actually really fun. It's a nice break from my other routine exercise days (treadmill, exercise bike, etc).

I have a feeling some of their other videos are more instructional, whereas this is supposed to be treated as a supplemental video for their other instructional belly-dance videos. Either way...a pretty fun way to burn calories.",1357689600,2,1331,4.753246753246753
1384894,4,B0000507PF,I haven't used this yet and am looking forward to using it many times. I got it faster than I thought I would get it thanks,1356393600,,123,3.769230769230769
1384895,4,B0000507PF,"I've had this DVD for six years now, and although I have way too many workout DVDs, I keep coming back to this one.  It's one of the more difficult workouts in my collection, so I do it when I'd like a bit of a challenge.  It includes a couple of challenging moves also, like layering hip moves onto a bouncing shimmy.  That was my first introduction to layering, and it takes practice, but I love to do it.  Also, the cool-down includes a challenging step that I sometimes have to stop and watch a couple of times to remember how to do.  The challenges keep it interesting.  I like to do the workout barefoot, as the twins demonstrate in the video, but the routine does involve some jumping and hopping moves, so some people might want to wear shock-absorbing shoes.  I don't really have a problem with it, and I find I feel sexier and better able to perform the moves without shoes.

Part of what makes this a workout, as opposed to a dance tutorial, is that Veena and Neena are not trying to teach us a dance routine in this one.  It just mainly takes fun bellydance moves and drills them, so you get a good workout.  There is no segment at the end where you're supposed to ""perform"" the moves you just learned.  It's just a workout, and I always get a good sweat going, and I also sometimes have sore calf muscles from the bouncing shimmy.

The voiceover kind of annoyed me.  This is something that's commonly done in bellydance DVDs, and I'm not sure why, since many of the dancers stress the importance of being able to move your abs without affecting your breathing, and breathing without moving your abs.  So why can't bellydance instructors dance and talk at the same time?  Most fitness instructors in other genres of workout DVDs do their own voice instruction while they demonstrate the workout.  I often feel that the energy in this workout would be better if the twins would just talk instead of wearing their beautiful, Barbie-like smiles and dancing.  On the other hand, I can get some good exercise with this DVD as is.  This is just a peeve of mine.

That being said. I have done Fitness for beginners, and break a light sweat. I did Fatburn, and broke a heavy sweat...

I did this one, and I was mopping buckets of sweat off my floor! The best part is, is I didn't even feel like I was working out, this felt like you were dancing along with the two ladies.

What really got me into the DVD is in this one, they actually look like their having a blast. At one point they start laughing when you 'bounce'. Is also so fun to actually dance, instead of just doing the moves :)

Thanks to these DVD's, I've lost 10lbs so far on my weight loss journey, and they've kept me super motivated because their fun!",1346630400,3,910,4.366863905325443

I am a little chubby (could lose 20Ibs or so) but am fairly fit (run 3 miles 3x per week, ride horses, workout with a kettlebell) and I definitely broke a sweat with this workout. What I love about this workout is that the dancers DO NOT PAUSE for the entire 30 minutes. I have a dance background and find myself EXTREMELY bored with dance workouts that pause endlessly to explain the moves. The simple moves on this DVD keep your arms above your heart almost the entire time, which adds to the cardio value and you transition constantly from one set of moves to another. I also like the fact that this felt like real bellydance, rather than a corny dance DVD with an 'Eastern flair', as some advertise. The music also sounds authentic.

Now, if I felt like it toned my body, like pilates or yoga, then fine.  But it did neither.  So this is not a workout for me.  Maybe it would be so for people who are beginning to get fit.

It is a fun work out and I did not find it difficult to follow at all. It starts with a good slow warm up and then moves onto the heart-rate constant kind of section and then the cool down. I thoroughly enjoyed this workout. I must say I was not much impressed with their other DVDs - the abs buns thighs / as well as the arms and upper body. So I was skeptical when I saw this in the library. But after watching it.. I did not regret buying it.

Obviously for weight loss one must have a varied exercise regime but I would categorize this in the light-to-medium range of aerobics. Fun but not difficult to do.",1316044800,,753,3.9215686274509802

I was very intrigued with bellydancing because of the gracious dance moves and I know this is not a far cry from doing yoga only you're burning more calories.  I tried the basic dance first and started enjoying Bellydancing so I loaned the Slim Down from the library and before I returned the dvd, I was already done ordering it on Amazon.

You will definitely do a cardio, sweat profusely and become very flexible.  I have maintained losing 1-2 lbs.(a week) apart from watching my food intake.  I have noticed my body became more shapely, clothes are less tighter and people are noticing my usual scrub uniform getting loser.  I am not trying to be model androgynous thin, I want to keep my womanly curves with just cutting inches.

Plus:  Improves your gait, equilibrium, stance and posture.  Like other reviews, allow a few minutes to wind down with the Bonus Felixibility Training of Rania.  Ten minutes of another extra time is good to loosen up the muscles.",1313971200,4,1057,4.695652173913044
1384910,5,B0000507PF,"I LOVED ""Slim Down"". Although I started out with Basic Dance, Beyond Basic Dance, and Mystic Dance by Veena & Neena - I found Slim Down to be the most effective in getting heart rate up to burn calories and to tone my arms & waist.  Mind you, I love all of their DVDs, as they teach you step by step all of the moves, however, Slim Down was not only clear in narration but also effective in me losing 8lbs in 2 weeks. (I started 3 weeks ago)

Five days a week, every morning I do the full 30 minutes of ""Slim Down"" followed by another 30 minutes of yet another Veena & Neena DVD: ""Arms, Abs and Hips, Buns & Thighs"".  Totaling a full-hour of cardio, and muscle toning and strengthening.  Pair that with a healthy diet and tons of water, the pounds fell off fast!  My shoulders look amazing, and my 'bat wings' are tighter and slimmer.  I feel great now wearing strapless tops and summer dresses.

Every two weeks I plan to step it up to avoid plateauing.  Now in addition to the full-hour of Neena and Veena, I do 30-minutes of various minor weight lifting prior.

But keeping with the review of ""Slim Down"", I find it motivating and active.  After you're done, you'll be sweating buckets like myself.  If you keep up with it, and maintain a proper diet, you'll begin to see weight loss and increased muscle strength!",1310947200,6,1317,4.33469387755102

I finally ordered this DVD and got it the other day and I have to say I'm so sad I waited so long to try it!!! I had so much fun working out!!! Neena and Veena are so graceful and beautiful to watch! I'm a true beginner when it comes to dancing and I found it very easy to follow along. Like some of the other reviewers had mentioned, there are a couple of short sections where they're showing you the dancer's face and not their feet. However, that's very short and within a couple of seconds you can see the full body shot. My only downfall about this DVD is that it's only 30 minutes!! The 30 minutes is great for a quick workout and it definitley does the trick, but I was sad it was over so quickly. So, to solve that problem I've already ordered a new, longer dvd. In the end..if you're in a workout run (like I was), this is a great pick me up..it adds an element of fun, it doesn't feel like working out and you feel great while you're doing it!",1304467200,3,1067,4.037735849056604

1384915,5,B0000507PF,"I love this DVD for a fun bellydance workout that keeps my heart rate up and burns calories. Other than during the warm-up and cool down, you are almost constantly bouncing, traveling or shimmying. I use a heart rate monitor when I exercise and the main part of this workout easily keeps my heart rate in zone 2 (70%-80%) and occasionally gets up to zone 3 (80%+).

The moves are simple and easy to follow. There is no floor work to take away from the cardio, and the few isolations are done quickly in between bouncing so your heart rate stays up throughout. At about 30 minutes, it's easy to fit the workout in even when you're pressed for time. Sometimes it would be nice if the workout was longer, but you can easily go back to just after the warm-up and repeat the main workout again before doing the cool down.

If you're looking for bellydance instruction, this is not the DVD for you. This workout doesn't teach you bellydance, and it isn't designed to do so. It's definitely not a routine that you'll want to perform as a dance. In fact, some of the moves are pretty silly, but it's fun to just let go and enjoy bouncing around. (Think of Phoebe running on Friends, if that helps!)

The verbal cues are sometimes a little off, but the workout is easy enough to follow without them. The twins don't speak directly, and the narration comes from a voiceover. Sometimes they seem on the verge of laughing, which always makes me smile.

Some reviews say that there's too much bouncing in barefeet. That doesn't bother me (or my knees), but you could easily wear tennis shoes if you wanted some more support. And yes, a sports bra is a good idea (but I tend to think that's a given).",1297900800,4,1686,4.429032258064516

1384918,4,B0000507PF,"This video doesn't really go into depth about learning dances of bellydance but it gives you the basics that you need in order to get into gear. I picked this up because I thought it would be fun to learn how to belly dance when I go to Ren Fair next year as well as lose weight.

I admit that I haven't actually lost weight from this video yet but that's mostly due to my own fault. I have however, noticed that I started to slim down. I have done many exercise videos over the past two years that I have not been happy with. I first started out with P90X which was recommended to me by my sister, who is on a much higher level of fitness than I am and I got tired of that and did Julians 30 Day Shred which I also did not like. With the two I stayed the same body type but gained muscle which caused me to gain weight. Normally I like to eat right, I like my share of veggies, grains, and fruit,but I've never loss any weight.

Like I said I still haven't lost but 1 pound with this but that's my own fault, if I did this like I want to I would lose more inches and probably a few pounds. Having had come from a heavy level of exercise, I thought that I could handle both the arms and abs, and the legs, and butt in the same day. I made it through most of the arms before nearly giving up. I try to do arms in the morning, legs in the evening or at least one of the two videos a day. What is great about this video is it gives you a workout without leaving you tired like most work outs or it did for me at least. Sure I was a little sore but nearly as much after doing one of my harder previous exercises. I've been doing this about 3 weeks off and on and I think if I do this every day like my goal is to eventually do I could get into the shape that I want to.

If your looking for a workout with out over exerting yourself, this is it. Its also thanks to this video that I'm beginning to feel more confident about my body. Pick it up, give it a try, some of the moves are hard at first but if you stick to it, you'll eventually get it.",1288137600,,2041,3.843230403800475

This particular DVD is a little strenuous for beginners and will leave you out of breath - but it's completely worth it. While it is physically and (depending on your mood) mentally challenging, just take it easy the first couple of times and you will feel like a million bucks when the workout is over...

For complete beginners, or anyone with belly dance experience who wishes to feel inspired I would recommend basic movies by Veena and Neena ONE HUNDRED PERCENT!  My recommendation is using Slim Down for those days you want to challenge yourself, and exercise to Basic Moves for those days you want something a little easier with flow.  This is exactly what I do and it works beautifully.

My Basic Moves DVD also comes with Fat Burning which is a real challenge, and I use it for those days I want to be dying on the floor while definitely feeling like I accomplished something.

Between those DVDs (Basic Moves & Slim Down) you've got every angle and mood covered. There's nothing Veena and Neena do that I don't like.",1285200000,3,1128,4.504901960784314

I managed to do most of the moves (minus some down time for panting and griping about being old) and nothing hurt as I did it.  I worked up a good sweat too.

This was also fun!  Sure, I had to chase my hubby upstairs to keep him from laughing at me.  But once I was sure of my privacy, I had fun.  You don't need a whole lot of room, but a 6' x 6' clear area of floor is necessary.  If you can convince the cats to keep out of your way, that's a bonus.

1384930,4,B0000507PF,"I started looking at belly dancing as a viable exercise alternative after watching the amazing Hafsia Herzi dance for what seemed forever in the final minutes of the film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-the-Grain-La-Graine-et-le-Mulet-Subtitled-in-English-Region-1-DVD-USA-Canada-Edition/dp/B001Q5CEGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of the Grain (La Graine et le Mulet) (Subtitled in English) (Region 1 DVD, USA/Canada Edition)</a>.""  The energy and passion that she exerted during this session sold me; with each sustained shimmy I felt myself drawn to this mysterious expression of sultry womanhood.  The fact that Hafsia (I do not know whether or not this Cesar Award winning actress actually performed the dance herself or had a body double) perspired profusely convinced me that belly dancing was not for the meek in spirit; all those exotic gyrations and erotically expressive undulations required fit muscles that worked within a tight frame and were controlled by a disciplined brain.  I could not wait to begin.

I purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Fitness-for-Beginners-Basic-Moves-Fat-Burning/dp/B00005N8AM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Fitness for Beginners - Basic Moves & Fat Burning</a>&nbsp;by the Belly Dancing Twins, Veena & Neena.  It wasn't tough, but it wasn't easy either.  The twins know their stuff--the routine required multiple viewings and practice sessions to become familiar enough with what was coming next to feel comfortable enough to just let go and enjoy the process.  After working out at least five times with this DVD, I decided that Veena and Neena were worthwhile instructors and thereby purchased their Slim Down workout.

Now I am not a dancer by any means.  My workout routine consists of running on the levee for about 60 to 90 minutes.  I break this up with some strength training using the  method of lifting heavier weights with less repetition, Tae Bo when the weather prevents me from going outdoors and Pilates to concentrate on moving from my core.  The exuberant flexible movements of belly dance do not exactly emulate my usual workout routine; so the idea of incorporating smaller quicker moves within a larger framework alone for me was a challenge.

The Slim Down DVD does not waste time on Basic Moves.  If you are an Uber beginner you must acquaint yourself with the terminology and the correlated moves by either purchasing a fundamental DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amira-s-Belly-Dance-101-Dvd-a-5-Star-Instructional-Video-of-Belly-Dancing-Basics-for-Beginners/dp/B000DZB8XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amira's Belly Dance 101 Dvd, a 5-Star Instructional Video of Belly Dancing Basics for Beginners</a>) or taking a beginner's class.  Of course, if you are a dancer, you need not worry.  This DVD probably will not be challenging enough to give you the workout you require.

In fact, it did not give me the workout I desire.  The twins start off with about a five minute warm-up (neck rolls, arm and leg stretches) and introduce what they call the genie bounce (side to side motion with alternating arms) which they activate to a jump once the music accelerates and the 20 minute cardio portion of the session is in full swing.  The genie bounce is used as a transition move throughout the session as the voice over (neither Veena nor Neena speak during the workout; however they do perpetually smile) announces what is to come about 5 seconds before the twins actually execute on the screen.  More belly dancing moves--shoulder and hip shimmies, hip drops and lifts--are used in Slim Down than in the Fat Burning DVD.  Fat Burning's cardio relies mainly on rocking back and forth, skipping and hopping but not for any great length of time.  In fact one of the most difficult moves for me to complete in the Slim Down is the shoulder shimmy while I move up and down.  It was tough to incorporate the small fast movement while making a larger overall movement. No wonder belly dancing is an art.

In the same respect, some of the hopping and twisting motions the twins employ may be too intense for someone who either has hip or knee problems or has just re-entered the exercising world from a coach-potato coma.  However if you are accustomed to high-impact running or kickboxing, don't expect the same type of rush that larger moves will give you in terms of fitness when performing Slim Down.  Despite the rocking horse motions, skipping and hopping, the low intensity nature of the belly dancing itself means that a mere 20 minutes isn't going to give you the cardio benefit that you crave.  Therefore, I would recommend this presentation as an alternative to be used on days where an intense workout is not required.

The twins finish up with a five-minute cool down for an overall workout of thirty minutes.  Included on the DVD is a Flexibility Training Workout which is very basic--I used this to complete my cool-down.  However, I would not recommend this session at all.

Bottom Line:  Although Veena and Neena rely on a voice over to instruct participants of their Slim Down Belly Dancing Workout, they both are attractively supple and slim with lovely attainable bodies.  Personally, I liked their Fat Burning workout better than this one, but only because I felt it gave me more intense cardio due to the high impact jumping. Slim Down does incorporated more Belly dancing moves--however, these are not really explained--the DVD contains no fundamental moves section. Belly dancing is an art that encourages expression through the rounded feminine form and makes a good alternative workout option that will round out your exercise possibilities. The music and costumes contribute to the overall exotic feeling that belly dance promotes.  Do wear a coin scarf around your hips to add weight--the sound of the coins swaying will put you in a sensual mood.  Otherwise don't expect the full cardio benefit of running or kickboxing but look at this as a fun introduction to something truly beautiful and exhilarting.

I've seen her practice with it and she seems to follow it pretty well. She has been doing the other videos from Neena and Veena for about 1.5 years now.
She has most of the basics down and this adds to it. Again I don't see any weight loss from this but some toning.
Also this one crashes on the PC a lot but not on the regular DVD player.
She gets a good sweat up doing this which is good and except for the format where you have to rewind many times to see what you missed. It's a decent video.
The belly dance style used is my wifes favorite as it combines so many styles.",1204502400,,764,3.872611464968153
1384937,5,B0000507PF,"This has to be my favorite workout dvd of all time.  Please note that this is a WORKOUT and you will not be learning a choreography or a lot of technique!  If you're looking for an instructional dvd this is not the one for you!

Now, with that said, this is a great workout video for a beginner/intermediate exerciser (advanced people will probably find this too easy).  Another reviewer mentioned how the workout can be modified to your fitness level very easily and that is absolutely true.  When I started using this I weighed 220 lbs (I'm 5'3"") and for several of the segments I simply had to keep doing the ""Genie"" because I could not do the jumping parts.  If you have bad knees or are very overweight do not feel that you have to be as bouncy doing ""the genie bounce"" as what the girls are, simply stepping back and forth is moving and it's getting you somewhere!!  For those who have never tried bellydance before, there are a few ""real"" bellydance moves, some of them are more folkloric style, and some are simply aerobics moves.  That said, this tape can benefit anyone wanting to take bellydance lessons because it does work the muscles that you need to perform the dance correctly.

At first I found it somewhat disconcerting to have a disembodied voice coaching me along, but the person narrating has a pleasant, soothing voice and gives pretty good cues.  She is not overly perky and you don't have to hear ""FEEL THE BURN!"" and other tacky cliched nonsense the whole way through the session.

The movements are easy to learn, there is enough repetition to allow you to get into how to do things, but not so much that you're completely bored before moving on to the next move.  The twins' outfits allow you to see what they're doing with their bodies (no big bulky pants hiding legs and feet and no blending into the background), and the background gives you that bellydance sort of feel.  The camera focuses pretty much on what you need to see (bad camera angles are an issue with many bellydance style videos).

I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could for 2 reasons.  The first being that during the sections where they have you doing hip lifts the girls lean waaay back to do them.  This is really not good for the back.  You will get the same benefit by standing upright and using your obliques to do the lifts (rather than simply pushing off with your foot).  The second issue with this video is there are a few parts where the splicing isn't done quite accurately and/or the voiceover doesn't quite match the video.  There are about 3 parts where it is a little ""off"" and can be a bit disconcerting at first, but once you get used to doing the routine it's easy to just ignore it.

Like I said, when I started using this video I weighed 220 lbs and I have been overweight most of my life.  Well what's that mean if you don't know what I weigh now?  I am currently at 145.  I started out using this video 2-3 days a week, because I was tired all of the time, easily winded, and I found out my doctor informed me that I was in the early stages of high blood pressure which scared me.  I had always wanted to try bellydance and so I though perhaps I'd actually stick with this routine.  I enjoyed it so much that I started using it 3-5 days per week within the first month.  I couldn't do all of the moves at first, so I just stuck with doing ""the genie"" or even marching in place for anything I could not do, then I slowly started doing the more difficult moves, maybe 1 or 2 jumps here and there, a few seconds up on the toes, whatever I could do.  By the end of month 4 I could do the entire tape without modifying anything  (except for leaning back during hip lifts which I mentioned before is not good for you).  Within about 3 months I had lost 35 lbs and hadn't made any major changes to my diet.  The only thing that I changed was the portion size of my lunches on the days I worked out because I knew I'd feel icky with the bouncing around if I ate too much.  With this video I made it down to 150 without any other diet modifications than the smaller lunches.  Now I'm to the point where I'm making small changes in my diet to lose more weight as my BMI is still a bit too high.

I don't know that there is anything particularly special about this video, if you use any video consistently you should lose weight and firm up.  However, this is the only video I found that I can really stick with.  I've bought  other videos to vary my routine, and some that are strictly choreography and technique, but I keep coming back to this one and still do it at least once per week.  I highly recomend this to anyone who is looking for something interesting to try, especially if bellydance appeals to you at all.  If you commit to using it you will see results, and those results can definitely encourage you to keep with it!",1200009600,13,4850,4.312362030905077

I would definately recommend this product to everyone interested in bellydance.",1195776000,,413,4.616438356164384
1384940,4,B0000507PF,"I must say I'm a little shocked at all the carping over this DVD.
First off, if you're doing this workout correctly you are going to sweat, and you don't have to be 400 lbs to do it. Yes, you do hop around a lot, and I have D-cup boobs and had no problem with them flopping around more than during jogging or any other aerobic activity, and I just wear a normal support bra.  And no, it's not a dance instruction DVD.  It's an aerobic workout with some bellydance stylization mixed in.  Yes, some of it looks funny, but you don't look exactly gorgeous while you're doing squats either.  I noticed an improvement in muscle tone/isolation and stamina after doing this routine for a week.

This is a good cardio workout, I think it's a little too short - would prefer at least a full 30 minutes of cardio and this program is 20 minutes with a five-minute warm-up and cool-down. Otherwise I would have given it five stars.",1190937600,5,918,4.376470588235295
1384941,1,B0000507PF,"The warm-up is pitifully short and rushed-feeling, and does NOT spend enough time on warming up the calves considering that you spend the rest of the video bouncing on your toes. I like their Arms & Abs and Hips, Buns, & Thighs routines (although as other reviewers have noted, the narrator is annoying the the musing can quickly turn grating) - but this one is hideous.

I don't doubt people have lost weight on it - however, I would argue that you could get the same benefit for jumping rope for the same amount of time. And you'd stretch out better first (hopefully) rather than trusting that the routine is complete and safe as presented.

And, as others have pointed out, if you wear anything above an A cup, you should probably strap the girls down for the duration. With duct tape.

On the other hand, if you can stand the music, do extensive stretching before you start, and have an industrial-strength sports bra... it'd probably be okay.",1182384000,12,947,4.625

I vastly enjoyed Slim Down over the Fat Burning section of ""Fitness for Beginners:  Basic Moves & Fat Burning"".  The Slim Down workout still is a bit repetitive (""genie bounce""), and I would like to have more time to practice the new moves as they are introduced, but I at least feel like I'm using some of the moves I learned in the Basic Moves section of ""Fitness for Beginners"".",1171929600,2,468,4.295454545454546
1384944,2,B0000507PF,"The useful part is tiny: several bellydance moves - each practiced for several seconds, and a few practiced for about 1 minute each. The rest is just goofy jumping, similar to ""Fat Burning"" (another workout by the same instructors). It's weird to see these girls doing such hokey-pokey... All their other videos are better. None of them are flawless, though, and the biggest issue is that they overlap each other in terms of both the material and the music.

That's it in a nutshell. Below I just can't resist sharing how this video might be amusing to watch once.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hoppy-jumpy NON-bellydance moves sometimes reach the point where they look deliberately clumsy. One of them looked almost like a bear walk.

The twins are perfectly aware of how silly they look, and sometimes they can't help but burst out laughing. Yes, even that sister who usually looks like a robot - can laugh!

The music during the ""Warm up"" section is incredibly funny, and I believe it was done on purpose. It sounds like a caricature (a well-done one!) of... march. I immediately envision drunk soldiers dragging their bodies and playing distuned instruments.

Even the narrator gets humorous this time. If I hadn't watched but only listened, I'd have gotten an impression that the video is not about innocent dance moves, but... a very different type of activity: ""That's it! You got it! Keep it going! That's it! Are you having fun? That's it! Feel the burn! That's it! Squeeze them... right here...""

Since this product is called ""Slim down"", I thought it would be aimed at overweight customers. But how come heavy people are expected to do all this jumping? I'm skinny, but even I, when attempted it, realized that a single bra is definitely not enough here... Maybe I'll try it again with 3 bras on... No, seriously, I even think that jumping is not the safest option for the overweight.

It's interesting to observe how *different* identical twins can be. Especially given that they grew up in the same environment. One is a good dancer, the other is so-so. One is animated; the other is impassive... I'm intrigued!",1158537600,4,2211,5.088397790055248
1384945,5,B0000507PF,"I love ALL the Neena and Veena videos, but this one is one of my favorites.  The movements are easy to do and you don't think you've got a great workout going because it doesn't LOOK or feel like you're doing much, and then before you know if you're sweating and tired and it feels great.  You do a lot of different moves so it doesn't even feel like you're spending 30 minutes working out.  I love, as I said, these vidoes and this combined with the fat burning are better than anything for losing weight and toning up.  I used to run five miles every day and I SWEAR these workouts are way better than that and WAY more fun.",1156982400,,626,4.148760330578512
1384946,3,B0000507PF,"While this DVD will give you a cardio workout, I felt like I was jyped, as there was very little in the way of bellydance form or choreography. If you want a good cardio workout, this will work for you, but don't think this is really belly dancing. Check out one of Rania's bellydance videos for a better perspective.

I also thought this DVD was rather boring and not very challenging. I didn't have fun doing this workout, although it did get my heart rate up.",1155340800,3,462,4.372093023255814

Postpartum, I used ""Basic Moves"" until I felt strong and could do the moves easily. I am now enjoying ""Slim Down"", and hope to work up to ""Fat Burning"" (the second workout on the ""Basic Moves"" DVD).  The routine works up gradually to a great aerobic workout that is perfect in intensity for someone who's not quite a raw beginner, but not up to a gruelling routine.  This DVD has the best cues of any of the Veena and Neena dvds I've tried, too.  The music is great, their smiles seem genuine, and the time passes very quickly.  All in all, the routine is great blend of low impact aerobics and light toning, which is the perfect combination for slimming down!

1384949,4,B0000507PF,I first bought this video in 2001 and have used it on and off depending on whether or not I felt like going to the gym.  It is alot fun for those who like to dance to get fit.  But it also will get you to break into a sweat depending on what you put into it.  It is good for beginners to intermediate level dancers.  You can even try these moves at the club and they are actually pretty impressive.  In conclusion this is a fun light workout when you don't feel like leaving the house.,1140307200,4,485,3.9587628865979383
1384950,4,B0000507PF,"I will start out by saying that I love this DVD.  The workout is short enough for a couch potato like me to get through, though I have to admit that I have to push a bit.  If you are in shape at all, this may be a bit too light for you.  Also, this doesn't really teach you bellydance moves so don't buy this DVD for that reason.  It really is just a fun little workout with a bit of bellydance flavor (some hip and chest moves) that will get a beginner sweating.  It does take a few runs through the routine to get the moves and steps down, but before long you'll be way ahead of the voice cues!  I would just stress two things: keep your abs tight throughout the entire workout and if your arms get tired (they will!) just lower them a bit and keep moving.  I think this is definitely worthwhile for the beginner.  Just don't take it too seriously and have some fun!  And definitely do the bonus stretching workout with Rania...not hard, but as I've said a couple of times already: keep it tight!",1135814400,10,998,4.15625

I'm lazy so I really struggle to make it through the whole workout. But for those of you who are in decent shape it will provide an okay cardio workout.

The workout is bellydance inspired, but it's a lot of travelling steps and bouncing. It's not my favorite DVD, but it does provide a decent workout.",1134345600,6,461,4.348837209302325
1384952,5,B0000507PF,"If you are looking for a highly sensuous dance routine, then this is much more playful and exuberant. The music inspires spontaneous motion and you may find yourself modifying various sections and even making up your own dance routines to the inspirational music.

Neena and Veena Bidasha dance in a room of flowing fuchsia curtains. The setting is beautiful with pillows all over the floor and a calm environment. They begin with simple shoulder rolls and simultaneously warm up your calves. After elegant stretches they get playful as you loosen up your hips and then delve into shimmies galore. The shimmies in this particular workout seemed very easy to accomplish and that might be because your body will naturally get into a rhythm with this particular style of music.

Overall, the music is especially inspiring, you will feel a sense of calm and the playful flow of the movements seem to promote the cleansing of negative emotions. One of my favorite Neena and Veena workouts. You can feel your body burning those calories as you strengthen your thighs and abs.

1384953,4,B0000507PF,"First of all, let me say that this is not for someone who has never experienced bellydancing.  They don't explain the moves, I'm guessing that they expect that you've already done their Basic Moves tape.  The voiceover says ""Now well do this"" and they go right into it.  No slowing it down.  This is a cardio oriented workout, and they don't slow down the pace at all.  I also want to mention that while it is a decent arms and abs workout, the part of my body that got the most attention was my calves.  Just let me say this.  I am a dancer.  I have been since I was about 6.  I have fairly developed calf muscles.  After this workout, honestly, if I didn't know better, I'd say I had never used those muscles before in my life.  Wow.  The set is amazing, and Neena and Veena are fairly easy to follow.  If you're prepared for a serious lower leg workout, this tape is for you.",1124668800,2,878,4.18562874251497
1384954,4,B0000507PF,"I was initially interested in purchasing this video because I wanted to try some type of Eastern dance technique and burn fat/calories at the same time (which this DVD claims to do).  I had high expectations for it because I know the two dancers, Veena and Neena have had international belly dance training and have acclaim in the Eastern dancing world...I was not disappointed at all.

The workout is of moderate intensity- starting out slower, gradually getting more intense, and then a short cool down at the end.  After 30 minutes of this tape, (i'm a young person, a little on the chunky side but not out of shape) I was sweating PROFUSELY...after about 2 weeks of doing this every day, I can definitely feel that my stamina has risen, I have lost at least 2 inches on my waist, and, complimented with a sensible diet, I've lost somewhere between 5 and 7 pounds.  The moves are generally easy to follow, except for some of the step movements, but after a few times you'll have it down. The only one complaint I have about this video is that the constant use of arms will make one tired after about 15-20 minutes, so I just bring my arms down lower to make up for the tiredness, and still keep them moving.

One piece of advice if you do this workout, and I hope you do: there is a chapter on this DVD called Flexibility training, which provides you with an extra stretch routine before you start Veena and Neena's workout- DO IT! Its indispensable in making sure you aren't sore after the bellydance workout, and stretches all the main muscles in the body, so it can be used if you are just looking for a basic stretch routine before any workout, like running or bicycling.

I definitely plan on buying more of Veena and Neena's workout tapes, once my endurance is high and I can do the workout without the voiceover (another great addition to this DVD is the removal of the voiceover, so you can practice with just Veena, Neena, and the music)

1384955,3,B0000507PF,"After trying a few other of Neena and Veena's Bellydance for Fitness videos, I was hoping that this one would provide a more intense cardio workout.  During the first half of the video, I was disappointed, as the cardio work consisted solely of the ""genie bounce"" (basically, a side step-type move with a bit of a hop).  Isolation moves were performed inbetween each genie bounce series, which meant that my heart rate did not stay elevated.

In the second half of the workout, however, the intensity picks up, as there are a greater variety of moves, including some different types of hops (although you always return to the genie bounce between exercises, which can get a bit repetitive).  There was a also a greater fun factor to this section, especially with the various hip exercises; the workout ends with a brief cool-down stretch.  Overall, I would say that this 29-minute workout probably provided about 15 minutes of solid, medium intensity cardio work.

The DVD includes several bonus features, including the option to perform the workout with music only (no narrative), a picture gallery and trailers from Veena and Neena's other videos, a bonus performance by Rania(another dancer), and finally, a bonus flexibility workout by Rania.  Rania packs quite a bit into this short, 10-minute segment:  she starts with plies and standing stretches, moves on to dynamic yoga moves such as cobra to down dog and cat to cow, and performs a variety of floor stretches as well.  Although this section was quick and none of the stretches was held for a particularly long time, I enjoyed this added little flexibility boost.  Overall, I would rate this video at about 3 1/2 starts and recommend it mainly for advanced beginning exercisers.",1118707200,2,1738,4.962068965517242

It doesn't look that hard, but it will definitely make you sweat if you aren't used to aerobic activity, and it WORKS, too.

IF you get the DVD (that's what I have) I'd recommend doing the flexibility training before and after the main workout- that way you are completely warmed up before, and stretched out afterward, so you don't get too sore.  The extra workout also helps with getting long and lean.",1116201600,6,579,4.538461538461538

It definitely helps with speeding up bellydancing moves too. I would not recommend this for a person who has never seen or taken bellydance before (try their tape ""Fitness for Beginners: Basic moves"" or ""The sensual art of bellydance: Basic dance"") if you're really trying to learn to bellydance. This is bellydance inspired and will help the already knowledged bellydancer speed up her moves while getting a rigorous workout in the process. I enjoy it, it's not too incredibly hard that I have to do only 1/2 a tape each time, but it's also don't wonder when the ""workout"" begins.

I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to lose weight and slim down, and just wanting to feel great about themselves....",1097452800,4,928,4.618181818181818

I have noticed a difference in my posture due to my stronger abdominal muscles, which has also increased my confidence. My friends and family are completely envious of my new change, and have also started this workout.
The Slim Down gives a good cardio workout that you don't have in the Basic Moves, Hips, Buns & Thighs, and Arms & Abs. By switching movements frequently, you still get an excellent workout all over, and it is not as tedious feeling as Fat Burn.
The best part about all of the Bellydance Fitness for Beginners is they do not require much floor space, and you can do them anywhere that you can take your DVD player!
I do recommend trying Neena and Veena's Basic Moves before progessing to any of their other workouts, just to get a feel for the motions before they are thrown at you in a faster paced set.",1088812800,11,988,4.464088397790055

I found it a bit difficult to keep up with them because I didn't know the moves very well...so I went back to the Discover Bellydance videos to learn them. But once you know them, Veena and Neena will put those lessons to work on your body in an upbeat workout!

The workout itself was quite fun, the moves were interesting, and I liked the music used.  However, I have issues with the voice-over instruction.  First of all, the cuing was off and at many times it does not explain many of the moves (i.e. proper form).  I'm used to instructors who explain the legwork as well as the arms so you don't have to keep your eyes peeled to the tv screen.  Also, the voice-over made me feel like I was watching a performance.  Veena and Neena are lovely women, but their smiles seemed to be those of performers, not women who are enjoying a workout.  And while I felt like I was working my legs and arms, I didn't really feel like I was getting an cardio workout(and believe me, I put a lot of effort into it).

It was so different from my usual work outs that I found myself having fun (mostly laughing at myself). The steps are simple, though for the coordination-deficients out there (me), you may have to pause the video once in a while to practice the move before continuing.
Sometimes the camera does closeups at inopportune moments -- this causes you to see only the hip movements, but not the foot placement, for example. That can get annoying.
I was a little dissapointed that the ""trailers"" did not have videos from Neena and Veena's series. Instead it was for some other woman. Also, they weren't really trailers but segments from those workouts. This was sort of nice because it gives you an idea what the ""flavor"" of the workout will be, I assume.
In short, after trying this video, I definately intend on buying other Neena and Veena workouts to spice up my usual work out home routine!
By the way... I don't mean to be crass, but I suggest wearing a heavy duty sports bra for the well endowed. The workout requires a lot of bouncing.",1077494400,90,1138,4.556097560975609
1384970,4,B0000507PF,"This is a great workout, but they leave out the disclaimer every bellydance teacher should give about posture. When bellydanceing it's a good idea to keep your hips tucked and knees soft or you'll hurt your back. However, to all the people who talk about not wearing shoes: just wear shoes. If it really hurts your feet, instead of complaining about the video, just wear shoes. Some people don't need shoes for this, that's fine too.

All that aside, its a great cardio workout with a fair amount of toning.",1076284800,4,507,4.633333333333334

I said that.  Now, I am sweating like crazy and working harder than I would have ever guessed before-hand.  AND I am laughing like crazy and LOVING IT!

 If you're a modern American couch potato mom (like moi, more than I would like to admit), whose most vigorous exercise is chasing the kids into the car to drag them to yet another after-school activity.  If you're wanting a great place to start burning off some of the the ""baby fat"" that came and never left.  If you want an exercise video that will keep you laughing at yourself as you do it (life is way too grim these days) rather than getting depressed and feeling stupid at the sight of a perfect young thing telling you to ""Come on, and feel the burn,"" (one whom you could never hope to match even with thousands of years of exercising and thousands more dollars spent at the plastic surgeon, and was probably born looking that and has never had kids yet, and lives on a single lettuce leaf for lunch!!!! ARGH!!!! Enough venting.)  If your most active pursuit is surfing the web (I am a web programmer and free-lance writer).  You've found the right video to help you get on your way.

The only discomfort I have felt so far is tired arms, but I already seem to dropping weight.  My husband keeps laughing at this forty-year-old shaking her tail but even he can see the difference after only a few days of working out with Neena and Veena.

Now, all I have to do is convince him to buy me the whole set for x-mas!  This will definately be a the top of my list of gotta haves!  I think he'll go for it!  He likes what he's seeing and so do I!",1061337600,30,1660,4.2756410256410255
1384979,5,B0000507PF,"I recently bought this tape and I love it. I've tried other cardio workout tapes, yoga tapes, etc., but never found one that I just couldn't wait to pop in to the VCR and move along with until now.
Be aware that this tape is not designed to teach you belly dance, and if you are looking to learn the dance itself you'll need to invest in their ""Sensual Art of Belly Dance"" series (a wonderful set of tapes themselves.)
Also, if you have never had any experience with belly dance, you will be more comfortable getting the ""basic moves"" tape first, and familiarizing yourself with it. You can do this tape without knowing anything about belly dance, but it will take you longer to work out the movements.
Although this tape is designed as a full-body cardio workout, you are doing most of the moves with your legs bent, which makes the thigh muscles, calves and glutes get a really good workout. I have bad knees and I've not had the slightest twinge from doing this workout. I would classify it as very low impact, despite some moves that involve jumps and twists.
The moves are incredibly easy to follow, with clear instruction and good photography. As another reviewer mentions, if you don't catch on to a move, you can always continue with the ""genie"" until they move on and you won't miss much.
I would say that I am beyond out of shape and I am able to keep up with this video. My heart is pounding and I'm sweating profusely, but I'm able to complete the whole 30 minutes. I haven't experienced any soreness the day after except for a slight twinge in my lower back and I suspect that people in better shape than me won't even have that. Don't despair if you're in really great shape and looking for a good workout to help keep you fit -- this will work for you too. I say that because belly dance makes your body move in such a different way than, say, a traditional aerobics class, that you will probably ""feel the burn"" enough. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities for you to up the level of the workout by making the movements more extreme and such. In that way, it is a very adaptable workout.
The best thing about this workout is that it really is fun. You're never bored. They keep your interest by not spending too much time on any one thing. Plus, the music is upbeat and the ladies are gorgeous and graceful and make you want to work really hard to be like them. They also aren't so perfect they make you feel like a bumbling idiot.

It really raised my heart rate and emphasized isolation exercises that have really tones my sides and legs.  Yes, the audio commentary can be confusing, but you have the option of turning it off if it gets too annoying.  The only complaint I have about this DVD is that it promotes ""performance footage"", but the footage doesn't feature Veena and Neena, it features some girl named Marina who isn't half as talented or engaging.

(I don' think they blink, either!).  I am pretty fit, but these moves like the genie, shoulder punches, chest compressions and step hop are at times painful (no shoes) and seem to have no slimming value.  The moves actually hurt your spine.  YOu do work up a sweat though.
Would definitely not recommend...after 3 attempts, I won't be doing this one again.",1053820800,14,515,4.806818181818182
1384986,2,B0000507PF,"This video was not at all what I expected, primarily because I expect something that has ""bellydance"" on the cover to, well, relate to bellydancing.  Aside from a cheap-looking ""Arabic"" set, this had nothing to do with bellydance and everything to do with bouncing up and down over and over.  In bare feet.  Yes, a high-impact workout without shoes and yes, it is as uncomfortable as it sounds.
The cueing is possitively awful.  Often times the person cueing will tell you to ""get ready"" for something that the dancers are already partway into doing.  And even when she doesn't do that, her counts are very off-beat and distracting.  The majority of the moves are never explained, so you have to try to keep up with what the instructors are doing while trying to figure out HOW they're doing it.
The ""dance"" is basically a bunch of jumping, with some sexy arm and hip moves thrown in at times.  It reminds me of the dance class I was in when I was 5 -- lots of jumping with very little actual dancing.
Finally, my superficial reason for disliking this video.  I expect a fitness instructor to look fit.  Yes, we all have our flaws, but most of us know how to cover them, especially if we're in the spotlight.  Apparently these girls disagree, as one of their stomachs hangs over the waistband of her pants.  And I'm supposed to expect a ""slim down"" to come of this?  Granted I have a bit of a stomach, too, but I'm also not telling people that if they do my video they'll be ""slim.""
I was very excited about this video since all of the previous reviews were positive, but I've found it doesn't live up to its hype.
If you're looking for something beautiful and fun that will teach you how to bellydance, you'll be disappointed, as well.  If you're going to be happy just jumping all over the place (it IS a calorie-burn, at least), then you may not mind it so much -- but a jumprope is a lot cheaper and just as effective.",1053475200,21,1922,4.410764872521247
1384987,5,B0000507PF,"I have all of Veena & Neena's videos, and this one is my favorite. As always, they're beautiful and graceful, the set is pretty, the voiceover is clear and easy to follow. It's an excellent workout, combining both aerobic exercise (try picking up those knees a bit higher and really moving that chest up during the Genie Bounces, if you don't think this is aerobic enough!) and isometric moves to tone and tighten. I love their teaching style; they execute a move (say, chest lifts) a few times, then it's back to Genie Bounces and then on to another move. If you don't ""get"" chest lifts, no big deal; you missed maybe a minute of your workout. If you are really lost (it took me a loooong time to figure out how to travel in a circle) you can always go back to Genie Bounces early.
I have found their videos highly effective for weight loss. By following the diet/lifestyle changes from the book ""The Pathway"" (by Laurel Mellin) and working out every day with Veena & Neena, I've lost almost 10 pounds and over 7"" overall since April 1st! I look *forward* to getting up early (before my three children) to dance. I alternate between their Abs-Arms and Buns-Hips-Thighs (M-W-F) and Basic Moves or Sensual Dance and Slim Down or Fat Burning (Su-T-Th-Sa).
As for this tape being dangerous...ha. I have bad knees (used to be a runner) and this workout is a breeze, even for me. I can't do Kili's Hula for Weight loss video (which is a pity, because it's a terrific, fun workout!), but this one I *can* do, no problem. The Fat Burning video, yes, I need to be careful. I simply can't do that many Choo Choos. But THIS video...no problem.
Oh, yeah, one more thing...according to my husband, I'm also learning to bellydance, along with losing weight and toning up.  ;-)!  Veena & Neena execute this routine with all the grace and sensuality of you would expect of a bellydancer...which, of course, they are.

1385004,5,B0000507PF,"I work out a lot and like to change my routines regularly. When I found this video I snagged it. The price was right and Neena and Veena are always fun to watch and learn from. I wasn't disappointed! It's easy, and yet there are enough challenges to keep your attention. By the end of the 30 mins I'm sweating up a storm. I'm hoping that someday I'll be able to master the hip shimmies! This video is perfect for the days when you just want a light but effective workout.",1027036800,3,471,4.186813186813187
1385005,4,B0000507PF,"Veena and Neena certainly provoke reaction that's for sure. I'm delighted that I bought this tape and have since purchased their boxed sets. I thoroughly enjoy them all.
This was my first intro to the twins and I watched through the tape before ""trying it out"" myself. I take classes so most of the moves were familiar to me, but I tried to look at it more like a bellydance *inspired* workout than an actual bellydance class. Having seen their other tapes I know they are able to provide the latter.
I enjoyed the length of the workout and the movements definitely engage all of you for a nice all over ""Workout Lite"". This is the kind of thing you don't mind doing after a long day at work- it's a bit of a vacation, even. I could, if I were a morning person, do this in the mornings for a great wakeup call!
The only thing that bothered me was the voice overs. I know that jumping around and speaking out of breath is bothersome also, so I don't really have an answer here. I was just put off by the vacant smiles; better of course than frowns or expressions of boredome, but I think some spoken breakdowns of the moves in between the voice overs would have helped to break that ""trapped dancers of the sultan"" look.
Then again, maybe that's what they were going for!",1017619200,3,1270,4.340336134453781
