2628767,4,B000H5U5YY,"Another reviewer I think already hit on the key point that this movie is more about love than about horror. I watched this movie last summer on DVD and really enjoyed it. For many people this will probably be their first Thai movie they've seen. I've seen a few as I've travelled to Thailand on a few occasions. I've certainly seen scarier Thai horror movies than this one, but I don't think it was the director's intent to make this a ""scary"" movie. As others have pointed out, this is a folk tale, and the movie feels like a folk tale being told to us. It's not supposed to be Jason v. Freddy with special effects and 12 different camera angles showing someone's head coming off. And I think it is more of a love story than it is a ghost story. If you are expecting blockbuster effects you will be disappointed. If you like seeing a folk tale or a good ghost story you might tell around a camp fire come to life, then you'll likely enjoy this one.",1235260800,3,949,4.277777777777778
2628768,4,B000H5U5YY,"Ghost of Mae Nak is a love story first, a horror movie second. The cast is excellent and the screenplay is original. If you give this film a chance, I think most people will enjoy it. It`s not a gross-out, slice and dice horror film, and it`s not supposed to be. It has it`s scary moments, but it`s the love between the lead characters, both living and dead, that makes this movie unique. It wasn`t what I expected, and that turned out to be a good thing.",1224979200,2,455,4.241379310344827
2628769,1,B000H5U5YY,"The Ghost of Mae Nak (Mark Duffield, 2005)

Low-budget cinematographer Mark Duffield takes a seat in the director's chair for his first outing, a Thai horror flick that had a great deal of potential, but ended up going nowhere. Mak (Siwat Chochaicharin) and Nak (Pataratida Pacharawirapong, both making their acting debuts) are about to be married, and have scouted out a house that American real-estate agents, if feeling overly generous, would term ""a fixer-upper."" Problem is, the house comes with the ghost of a much older Nak (Porntip Papanai, recently seen in the states in The Elephant King), who is envious of the couple's love for one another, and is willing to go to any lengths to make sure they stay together.

The first half of the film steadfastly refuses to descend into the world of the typical young-and-beautifuls effects-heavy slasher flick. Deliberately paced and beautifully shot, it feels more like a documentary about marriage traditions in Thailand than a horror film. Duffield sets up a relatively complex web of corrupt and malicious people around the couple, though, and when it's time to go to town, my, he does go to town. It's at this point that the movie devolves into a pale reimagining of a whole lot of Southeast Asian horror films that have come before it. Much of the fun of watching the last half of the movie comes from playing the ""hey, Duffield got that scene from movie X!"" game.

I think Duffield may have promise as a director, but he'll need to figure out how to put a slightly more original spin on his ideas first. * ",1178841600,2,1563,4.756457564575646
2628770,5,B000H5U5YY,"This movie is a ghost story made out of a legend. It was well written and the acting was excellent. If you like actual ghost stories, this one is definitely for you!",1178409600,3,165,4.1875
2628771,2,B000H5U5YY,"I will be the first to admit that I was expecting this film to be a little better than it was. Having seen the film ""Nang Nak,"" directed by Nonzee Nimibutr, and starring Initra Jaroenpura as Nak, and Winai Kraibutr as Mak, I guess I expected a little too much from this film. I do not wish to discourage other viewers from viewing the film; however, it just is not a very good film. I can understand the viewers below giving it one star. It should have been better. For those who are not familiar with this legendary ghost story; Mae Nak Phrakhanong is one of the most familiar folklore legends to come out of Thailand. And if you have seen the 1999 film, the story is a very sad one.

In the 1999 film, ""Nang Nak,"" which took place in the 19th-century, Nak and her baby have died while the husband Mak was off to war. When he returned, he resumed his life with his family, unaware that his loved ones were dead. Therefore, the villagers tried to warn Mak that his wife and child were dead. Buddhist monks and others interfered to help Mak, however, he refused to listen. That is until one day he discovered while looking between his legs [part of seeing a ghost in Thai legend] that he uncovered the truth. Nak's love for Mak was great, and she tried to reach out to Mak. Meanwhile her body was given a formal Buddhist ritual which finally put her and child to rest. At least in theory. Fast forward to the 21st-century and Mae Nak is still not at rest.

I will not give out spoilers to the film as it is pretty much a new release here in the west, and many have not seen the film. The story is set Bangkok, and two young newlyweds, Mak (Siwat Chotchaicharin) and Nak (Pataratida Pacharawirapong) have settled into a new home, which bring both of them into contact with the ghost Mae Nak. They have also acquired an old antique brooch [purchased by Mak]. This brooch has a connection to Mae Nak [no spoilers] The spirit of Mae Nak (Portnip Papanai) however is not at rest, and there are certain interactions she makes between these two newlyweds. I don't wish to give out too much which will ruin the film for you, however, this film is a huge disappointment. Especially considering that it is a Tartan Release. This is not a scary film, however, horror is a genre that each of us see differently. I recommend that you rent the film first. However, be prepared to be disappointed.

2628772,1,B000H5U5YY,I'M SORRY BUT THIS IS NOT A MOVIE YOU WOULD WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON. REALLY. I WOULD ALSO NOT RECOMMEND EVEN RENTING ( BUT DO THAT IF YOU MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF ) IT AS AFTER THE FIRST APPEARENCE OF THE GHOST IT'S ALL A STRAIGHT DOWNHILL RIDE. IF AMAZON HAD A NO STAR THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS. YOU'RE WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT THAT REALLY NEVER COMES. A VERY WEAK EFFORT.,1169856000,10,382,4.0394736842105265
2628773,1,B000H5U5YY,"This is by far Tartan's worst release. For a distributor that has brought us great titles as The Booth, the vengeance trilogy and else, this is scary at its lowest. The legend of the ghost is explained in other reviews, and it is quite interesting, to say the least. But this pseudo movie is not even that. Directed by a long-time contributor of B-movies (check his filmography), The Ghost of Mae Nak fails to be scary, is not stylish, and not even interesting. But it certainly is predictable, boring, lame, has the worst dialogues you'll hear in a long time, and it is plainly mediocre. Perhaps it is the style of the westerner director, he has shown that he likes/loves Thailand (Butterfly Man), but his skills as a director are not enough to create anything interesting.

Watch Shutter, that one is truly creepy and is told by Thais who really understand Thai and know how to film. Don't waste your time with this dud.",1167609600,18,922,4.621951219512195
2628774,5,B000H5U5YY,This was such a good movie!!  I rented it and liked it so much I had to buy it!

2628775,5,B000H5U5YY,"The legend of the ghost of Nang Nak is a part of Thai folklore, the story of an 19th Century 'angry ghost' who lived in a bucolic palm-fringed village outside of Bangkok named Pra Khanong..

By 2005, Pra Khanong is part of the dirty old metropolis, the giant grey concrete slab of Bangkok. No longer a place for a rural ghost.

I have never even been there - there's no compelling reason to go. It is ten minutes from where I live, but it is just another part of inner city urban blight nowadays.

This movie works because it treats Bangkok not as a glitzy tourist venue, full of pachyderms, tuk tuks, ladyboys and long-tail boats, but a functioning, ordinary, third-world city in which regular Thai people live with limited budgets and modern fears.

Into this is transported a semi-Gothic, semi J-Horror story, that derives from the old mythology.

Thai movies are often unsophisticated, self-referential and burlesque. This one doesn't fall into that trap, perhaps because it is Directed by a Westerner and doesn't play to stereotype.

I liked it.",1157932800,17,1050,4.805555555555555

8136868,1,B000H5U5YY,"In Thailand, during the reign of Rama IV, King Mongkut, there lived a beautiful young woman by Phra Khanong in Bangkok. That is an area next to the water ways that have marked the city known as the Venice of the East. This young lady was named Nak and she became a legend whose story has been told and retold through books, TV, and movies. Her fame has grown so much that there is a shrine dedicated to her where people go to offer her and her child gifts and ask for help, though pregnant women always avoid it, because Nak died during childbirth. Even today she is known by all, revered and feared, as Mae Nak, Thailand's most famous ghost.

 Her story is a tragic one of course, why else would she be a ghost. She fell in love with a young man named Maak. They were married and were living happily until Maak was called up for military service. This was because the Kingdom was involved in fighting one of their neighbors, though the legend doesn't really say. Before he left Nak became pregnant, though Maak didn't know this. While Maak was away Nak went into labor, but died along with her child and was buried by the villagers. Maak was seriously wounded during the fighting and was away longer than he thought he would be while healing. When he returned home he found his beautiful wife and newborn child greeting him.

 He lived happily again with his wife, but started noticing that people would avoid their home. People who were once their friends and neighbors would never go near them. A few braver villagers went to tell Maak that his wife had died while giving birth when he was away at war. Of course Maak didn't believe them because his wife was right there at home. They told him she was a ghost, as was the child and warned him he better leave. These same villagers would turn up dead, as the ghost of Mae Nak would become furious at them for getting in between her and Maak. When Maak figures out that the dead villages were right and that Nak is responsible for killing them, he of course runs. This drives Nak well over the egde, as much as a ghost can I guess.

 Eventually, though different accounts tell of different events, there was an exorcism that captured Mae Nak and kept her from terrorizing the village. She only stopped as she was promised to be reunited with her dear Maak in another life. During the exorcism, the head monk removed her corpses forehead, thus providing a path for her soul to depart the body. This bit of bone was made into an amulet that is lost to history. Thus the legend of Nak's undying love is born. Thais called her from then on Mae Nak, or Mother Nak. Sometimes she is referred to as Nang Nak, or Lady Nak.

 Her shrine, which is where she is supposed to be buried, is filled with offerings like food, drinks and toys for her child. There are dresses for her to wear and paintings done to capture her beauty. There is also a statue of her and her child covered in gold leaf and dressed up, for the visitors to pay their respects to. People leave all manner of objects, like coke for her to drink, diapers for her child, and they always have a TV playing in her room, so she never gets bored. It is said she favors young lovers, and hates the military draft. This explains all the young men who have been called up to serve that come to her and ask her for help get them out of it.

 For Thai people there is no strong separation between the living and the dead. The dead are there, moving around the living, it is just a matter of the living noticing them or not. Mae Nak is held in high regard because she was a powerful spiritual person. Her love for her husband and her will to stay with him was so strong that she could manifest convincingly for her husband, as a flesh and blood woman. She could commit murder even. Since she has this power to effect the world of living so much, people feel the need to keep her happy. They might ask a favor as well, because if she can kill people as a ghost, she must be capable of other things, right?

 As I stated earlier her story has been told many times. My wife recalled for me a version that was popular when she was a child. She watched a TV show about Mae Nak with her grandmother that scared her silly. Several movies have been done about her as well. One of the more internationally know was Nang Nak, which was done back in 1999. This version was well funded and was a selection of the Rotterdam Bangkok Film Festival and included a well know cast, especially the beautiful Intira Jaroenpura as Mae Nak.

 Unfortunately, the movie I got to see recently was not Nang Nak. What I watched was The Ghost of Mae Nak, which was directed by British director Mark Duffield. This movie didn't deal with the legend of Mae Nak, but told a story about her return as a ghost, after being exorcised. In this film a young couple named Maak and Nak, already the pathetic attempts at plot building start, get married and buy the house that used to belong to Mae Nak. Mae Nak, thinking this young Maak is her Maak returned to her, begins to haunt the couple. Maak buys a protecive amulet because of nightmares that Mae Nak is giving him, which just happens to be the bone amulet made from her forehead. Mae Nak is protective of Maak but jealous of Nak. So this means she helps the couple only when Maak will somehow be harmed. People who try to harm Maak in some way are killed off. Eventually Mae Nak tries to replace Nak, even though Nak is doing everything she can to put Mae Nak's ghost to rest. Nak's motivation to help Mae Nak is to convince her to let Maak come up of the coma she has put him in.

 The whole movie was horrible. I do not normally like horror films, because I don't like being scared. There is enough in this world to be scared about that I don't need it in my entertainment. Plus, I scare easy, real easy. I have a very active imagination that keeps working well after the movie is over, so horror movies stay with. As for slasher films, well, I don't like violence for violence sake. I think there is something wrong with enjoying story-less violence. Those types of movies end up being nothing but torture films, as far as I am concerned. I convinced myself to watch this as it was a ghost story, more than a horror film, per se, and it was based on a cultural icon of Thailand. The Ghost of Mae Nak did not scare me. Some horror films are so bad that they are funny, like Evil Dead or Gremlins. The Ghost of Mae Nak so bad it wasn't even funny. My wife and I couldn't even make fun it and enjoy it that way. As far as learning about Mae Nak in popular Thai culture is concerned, this movie failed that as well. In the end the whole film is a failure on many different levels.

 Normally I name the actors, just in case someone would want to learn more about them, but since I don't believe one person in this film is a professorial actor I am not wasting my time. Only few minutes into the film and I thought this was a school film project and Mark just got a bunch of his best friends to star in it. The lead playing Maak can't even fake being drunk, but stammers out his lines. The effects were despicable. One scene was a man's head being taken off by a passing train and then flying through the air. It looked more like a bad cartoon from the late seventies, rather than a horrific murder committed by a ghostly woman. The `terrorizing' face of wrath that Mae Nak makes at people was just a childish animation over the actresses face. The best actor in the film was the actress playing Mae Nak, and that was because all she said was Maak's name. Most of the time she just stood there, she was really good at that.

 The only reason I decided to write this review in the first place was to discuss a little Thai culture and warn people about this film. Please, do not see it. I have two hours of my life I can not get back. Writing this review is the only way I can get something for my wasted time watching Duffield's film. There is a much longer list of Mae Nak inspired performances to see. I highly recommend finding one of those instead.",1365033600,2,8067,4.27391874180865

8136871,1,B000H5U5YY,"I watched this movie just to see what it was about and I felt that it took too long to get to the point. There are many other JHorror filmz that out beat this trilogy, like wise. The beginning of it took 30 mins or so to pin point the wedded couple's relationship. I mean, they were so lovie dovie that it made me want to vomit...which is sad! It's sad because usually a viewer would want to puke after watching a grousome/blood slashing scene. Indeed it has only one spellbounding-death scene that caught my eye (The part where the con-man gets chopped in half by a falling sheet of window glass for a newly constructed office building w/in the city) and that's it. I'm sorry, but I just hated the storyline of the whole feature all together.",1296691200,,743,4.391304347826087
8136872,1,B000H5U5YY,"It's a slow starting movie that is extremely boring. Half the movie is about a wedding and the rest is about a ghost. I don't get why Asian folklore tales always become poor screen adaptions that have so little in common with the story they are even about. I mean this movie should start 44minutes in! That's where the real horror movie starts and that's all that is needed 60 minutes for this. The first 45 minutes and I swear to anyone that plans to watch this movie that you are not missing anything at all. Nothing happens and if it did it wasn't even worth a second look. All you do is sit and watch the most fabricated couple in the world carry on about their everyday lives doing what ever it is that they do.

 You just sit there and yawn hoping that something interesting will happen and it never really does. These people aren't even likable I don't care what happens to them I want the ghost to get them! Matter of fact I think that's just it. You ever watch a movie where the characters are so annoying and so boring that you root for the killer to catch them so they can put you out of the misery of watching them for another second!?! Well this is it! This is that movie!

And what's with these movies where the beautiful girl is always with some dorky wimpy guy. How am I supposed to take a movie seriously when already it has an unbelievable couple pairing?

For Horror I watch a lot of Japanese and Korean films. I don't know what it is about Thai movies but I haven't honestly found one that I like yet. I don't know what it is. Maybe because every Thai movie I see they make it a point to shove their culture down my throat and then finally decide to start the movie. Yes, that's what I want to see! 30-45 minutes of the Travel Channel Thailand edition and then 40-60 minutes of the DAMN MOVIE I PAID TO WATCH! I mean seriously it gets old fast. I don't mind a little cultural difference that's why I like foreign horror but when it has NOTHING! to do with the movie than it's like what the heck was the point of that?",1294358400,,2037,4.202046035805626
8136873,4,B000H5U5YY,"Ghost of Mae Nak: 7 out of 10: First we had J horror ( stark white Japanese female ghosts with long black hair that scream) then Korea developed K Horror ( featuring stark white Korean female ghosts with long black hair that scream) and now we have T horror (featuring stark white Thai female ghosts with long black hair that scream). From the looks of all things alphabetical can a home grown Vietnamese ghost story be too far behind.

Now I am not that big fan of ghost stories and the Japanese take on the subject has done very little to impress me. There are only so many faulty florescent lights and violin screams that one man can take. So it surprised me that Mae Nak is as entertaining film in its own right. For one thing this is more a romance than a ghost story.

The story revolves around two very likable kids (named Nak and Mak) who are getting married and settling down when one of them (the guy) is haunted by a ghostly vision (see above). They have true love and the ghost is jealous or vengeful or in pain or something. So they have to help her spirit to rest because (SPOILER ALERT) they bought the house she used to live in and pledged their love on her unmarked grave and received part of her skull as a wedding gift. (No I'm not making this up) The non-ghost scenes however with the couple buying a house and dealing with various relatives and cultural demands are delightful and fresh to these western eyes. And the two leads are both attractive and pleasant and give of the aura of being real people with real lives. (They both have actual jobs and go to punk rock bars with friends).

The movies other asset is the Final Destination style death scenes the ghost uses to exact revenge or protect the couple or whatnot. The special effects are excellent and the camera isn't to shy about the gore.

The film clearly has a healthy budget and talent behind the camera. On the negative side the movie plot is right out of a Scooby Doo episode and the film is about as scary as one. Lack of fright aside for a J horror style ghost story this is a pretty good film.",1268870400,2,2083,4.333333333333333
