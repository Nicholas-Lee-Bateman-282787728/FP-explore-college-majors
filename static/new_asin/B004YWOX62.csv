8448988,5,B004YWOX62,"Sharyn Pak is host of Candymaking, a user-friendly DVD tutorial to the joy of making seven different types of candy: dipped/drizzled candy, cluster/turtles/bark, molded candies, peanut brittle, filled candies, lollipops, and saltwater taffy. No expensive materials are required outside of standard kitchen utensils and possibly some candy molds. An excellent ""how-to"" demonstrative video for cooks of all skill and experience levels, Candymaking is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to candy lover everywhere - and as a resource for making unique, sweet-toothed gifts with the perfect homemade touch! --Midwest Book Review

Sharyn Pak, host of several crafting titles, turns her attention to candymaking in this program likely to appeal to children as well as adults. Many of the treats created here require molds and ingredients from candy supply stores, but there's also a section on tempering high-quality chocolate for dipping bonbons. Techniques start out simple, such as coating store-bought sandwich cookies or pretzels in chocolate or colored coatings melted in the microwave oven (who knew that Nutter Butters dipped in yellow or white coating could turn into ghosts and snowmen?). From there, Pak moves on to caramel-pecan turtles and chocolate bark, molded confections and dessert shells (using craft molds and pre-packaged Wilton Candy Melts discs), peanut brittle, and lollipops. Most interesting is the section on filled candies, which includes instructions for making peanut butter cups. Pak even makes pulling saltwater taffy look easy. Because candymaking involves heat and often hot, sticky ingredients, children will need to be supervised. Featuring PDF lists of ingredients, tools, and materials, this sure-to be-popular how-to is RECOMMENDED. --Video Librarian

Craft expert Sharyn Pak believes anyone can make candy at home, and she sets out to prove this theory with very successful results. In clear and concise steps, Pak demonstrates the skills needed to create seven different types of candies--from basic dipped treats to molded chocolates to taffy--frequently repeating a step as needed to reinforce a particular skill or concept. The menu allows viewers easy access to the various sections; the production values are simple yet solid. While the confections viewers learn to make may be more Good Housekeeping than Gourmet, Candymaking is still a terrific introduction to the art of candymaking, and Pak's latest crafty effort would be a stand-out title for those who like to sweeten up their table. --Library Journal",1325116800,,2531,5.605744125326371
