8265457,1,B001795FJY,"All 3 of Julius dvds are crap. He talks too much, and keeps talking of concepts rather than teach drills and various techniques.he also keeps flinching during moves as if he is expecting to get hit. That is so irritating. Even my wife commented on that although she doesn't practice arnis eskrima.
Then he has these huge two apes as his partners who look like duhs or Shrek who keep pretending as if they are in pain and also keep grinning to someone off the set.
I bought these three videos from blackbeltmag.com and not from amazon.
All the 4 clowns in these videos which includes a weak looking female are dressed to kill with waist scarves with their names on them and some weird emblazoned forearm sleeve which has no purpose whatsoever. You would think it provides some protection during practice but it obviously doesn't because you often see Julius pulling it up so it's obvious it's not designed to protect.
Melegrito also keeps throwing in the cops into his ramblings and it seems to me it was to impress.
Don't waste your money on these bulls*** videos. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. And don't believe the guy who gave the 5-star rating.",1427155200,,1156,4.616504854368932

8265459,2,B001795FJY,"I got this video set for a VERY good price, so I thought I'd give them a look.  I'm a practitioner of various martial arts including several Filipino Martial Arts, and was interested in checking out another person's  view of Filipino Martial Arts.  I was less than impressed to say the least.  The techniques are past the beginner level and yet don't explain well the basics that would be needed to properly perform and understand them.  While Mr. Melegrito appears to have a fair knowledge of the background of some styles and his teaching methods are decent, the information needs to be taught in a much different manner to properly educate those unfamiliar with the styles.  If you're interested in learning Filipino Martial Arts, you'd be MUCH MUCH MUCH better off picking up Remy Presas's Modern Arnis books and videos.  I",1350864000,5,827,4.822695035460993
