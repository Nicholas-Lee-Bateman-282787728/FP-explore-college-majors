There is a very troubling scene in this movie where entire families are executed quite brutally. A man is forced to watch as his son is stretched to death between 2 cars. You here the child scream for his father as the cars screech in opposite directions. Although I know that perhaps executions like this may have occurred in the real world mobs, drug cartels and their like, I don't think anyone needs to see this level of violence and brutality. This one scene made me turn away in disgust and has stayed with me. Maybe I simply don't have the stomach for this kind of thing.

I give this movie 1 star not for its flat mediocroty but for the horrifying images. Dante Lam, What is wrong with you?",1221609600,2,924,4.274285714285714
8229244,3,B000XR2Y3Q,"Jiang Hu is one of those films that's rather good rather than really good, a glossy crime drama that sees gang boss Andy Lau considering retirement as his first child is born while trying to dissuade his left-hand man (literally) Jacky Cheung from killing not just the three most likely suspects behind a prospective hit but their entire families as well. While the two spend most of the film talking over dinner, it's left to Shawn Yue and Edison Chen to carry the plot forward as the would-be hitman and his sidekick whose progress mirrors the two ageing Triads. It's glossy and often strikingly well made, but not enough to hide the thinness of the material, overstretched even at 85 minutes, or the fact that Lau and Cheung's plotline is so static. There is one nice in-joke, however, with PTU's Lam Suet as yet another cop who loses his gun.",1198800000,2,846,4.6466666666666665
