4264471,4,B00465I1DI,"I would suggest picking this up just for the simple fact that it's better than last years.  It has all the good matches and all the good segments from RAW.  They did a great job handpicking all of the footage for this DVD.  I wouldn't quite go as high as a 5 star because I thought they should have featured promos/segments in their entirety instead of a video package.  They also should have featured more NeXuS because they were/are a huge part of RAW.  All in all I would recommend this to all fans, not just collectors.",1296259200,3,523,4.350515463917525

8417054,4,B00465I1DI,"While I stated in that 2009 was a landmark year for WWE when it came to the RAW brand when it came to various things, 2010 certainly surpassed it as WWE brought more new concepts (anonymous RAW General Manager), elevations & breakouts for various superstars (Evan Bourne, Sheamus, John Morrison, Daniel Bryan, The Miz), the return (Bret Hart) & goodbye (Shawn Michaels) of legends with the biggest impact being made by a group of rookies in WWE (Nexus).  Along with matches & highlights of each month include Bret Hart's return to RAW, Shawn Michaels & Undertaker making their ""Streak vs. Career"" WrestleMania match, Batista & John Cena's confrontation, highlights of Shawn Michaels' retirement speech, The Cutting Edge with Randy Orton, Batista quits, highlights of The Nexus attack & fallout the next week, C.M. Punk & Big Show looks back at 900 Episodes of RAW, Miz reveals his magazine cover, Wade Barrett calls out John Cena, Tea Time with Santino Marella & Vladimir Kozlov & Sheamus, Piper's Pit with John Cena & Randy Orton & Miz cashes in Money In The Bank while John Cena's ""farewell"" speech after Survivor Series is on the Blu-Ray edition.

Unified Tag Team Champions D-Generation X vs. Chris Jericho & Big Show -  This was the last chance for Chris Jericho & Big Show to regain the titles because if Jericho lost then he would have to go back exclusively to SmackDown.  This was a very good match that got more back & forth between both teams at each time along with a small comedic element in Hornswoggle (the DX mascot at the time) in what turned out to be a fun tag team match which we don't get a lot of these days.
Jan. 4

John Cena vs. Sheamus - This was a non-title match with Sheamus dominating for most of the match as he was always one step ahead of Cena when it came to countering & escaping his signature moves like the A.A. & STF while Cena was able to make comebacks & get some offense on Sheamus himself.  The bigger picture here through was the appearance of Sheamus' Royal Rumble opponent of Randy Orton & what ended up happening between all three men.
Jan. 25

Christian vs. Sheamus - Christian was the ECW Champion at the time but with the announcement that WWE was ending the ECW soon & all the talent on that brand would be free agents, Christian came over to RAW to ""test the waters"" eventually setting up this ""Champion vs. Champion"" match against WWE Champion Sheamus.  This was a good match between both men with each men trading momentum & Sheamus heavily focusing on Christian's arm.
Feb. 8

Triple Threat Elimination Match:  Unified Tag Team Champions D-Generation X vs. CM Punk & Luke Gallows vs. ShowMiz - This was under the format of the original ECW's ""3 way dance"" where instead of the first team to score the victory wins, this was elimination style with the last team standing becoming the Unified Tag Team Champions. This was a match that went back & forth between all three times & continued on once Punk & Gallous were eliminated. Although the result of the match was ShowMiz becoming the Tag Team Champions, the bigger picture here was the issues with Shawn Michaels in regards to his frustration over not only his issue with Undertaker but also Triple H.
Feb. 8
[Big Show: A Giant's World]

Shawn Michaels vs. Kane - This match was under the same stipulations as the upcoming WrestleMania match against Kane's brother, Undertaker, where you could only win via pinfall or submission.  Kane showed that he had the power advantage early while HBK attempted various submissions like the crossface & anklelock.  The big story here was the appearance of Undertaker in the match before HBK was able to defeat Kane in what did turn out to be his last match on RAW.
Mar. 22

Randy Orton vs. Jack Swagger - Swagger cashed in his ""Money In The Bank"" briefcase days earlier on SmackDown to win the World Championship & him switching brands in the process leading to this being the last night he was a member of the RAW roster against the man who pinned win a week earlier.  While Randy Orton put in a good performance, it was an impressive performance by Swagger who was in control of Orton for most of the match while showcased a heavy amount of different suplexes.
Apr. 5

Divas Champion Maryse vs. Eve - This match was short & sweet as it's noted only for Eve winning the Divas championship while doing a unique counter to Maryse's DDT.
Apr. 12

Unified Tag Team Champions ShowMiz vs. Hart Dynasty - With the Hart Dynasty winning the gauntlet match the night before at Extreme Rules, they got their title shot here.  While Big Show was dominate whenever he was in the ring with his various chops & even holding up Kidd for a headbutt at one point, the Dynasty focused their attack on Miz with Smith giving him his dad's (British Bulldog) famous delayed suplex while taking advantage of whenever Miz was too busy trying to show off as he fell to the Hart Attack & Sharpshooter for the Harts to finally win the Tag Team Titles.
Apr. 26

Christian vs. Edge - These two had a confrontation with each other on the night Edge left for RAW while Christian came to SmackDown (seen on the SmackDown 09-10 DVD) so Christian came to RAW for this match.  With these men having such a long history, they were able to counter each others such as the spear & Killswitch.  Christian's arm was worked over here & played a heavy factor in the closing moments.
May 17

John Cena & Evan Bourne vs. Edge & Sheamus - This was originally scheduled to be Randy Orton teaming with Cena but due to injury, Evan Bourne stepped up & teamed with Cena here.  Bourne's was in the ring for a majority of the time & did more than just hold his own here against both men as this can't be described as anything more than his ""breakout"" match.
May 31

Evan Bourne vs. Chris Jericho - This was a rematch from the previous night's ""Fatal 4 Way"" PPV with Chris Jericho putting his own stipulation that he will leave WWE if he loses.  Jericho attempted to ground Bourne while Evan continues to keep countering Jericho's offense such as turning an attempted Walls Of Jericho into a DDT while also doing such a high vertical leap that he was able to catch Jericho on the top rope for a frakensteiner.  A real great match.
June 14

Randy Orton vs. Edge - This was the rematch from their draw at ""Over The Limit"" that went back & forth between both men with Edge giving Orton a big boot at one point that looked to have knocked him silly while Orton was able to punt Edge in the middle of a spear.  While these two had a good match, the real highlight was what happened afterwords as Randy Orton gave one of the most memorable RKO's I've ever seen.
July 12

Randy Orton vs. Edge vs. Chris Jericho - This was to determine the #1 contender to face Sheamus for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam.  Edge & Chris Jericho teamed together to work over Orton in the first half of the match before the fact that only one man can win the match came into play & turned against each other.  This was a PPV quality match as it was non-stop action with everyone countering each others moves & very close near falls.
July 19

Lumberjack Match: John Cena & Bret Hart vs. Edge & Chris Jericho - This was setup based off the problems within Team WWE with all these guys.  Nexus were the lumberjacks for this match & came into play various time as they attacked Cena whenever he went to the floor yet kept giving Jericho a pass before eventually turning on both him & Edge causing Team WWE to finally be united in the end...and for the record, this was a glorified handicap match as Bret Hart was never tagged in.
Aug. 9

Chris Jericho vs. Wade Barrett - This was the opening match on a night of RAW where all the members of Nexus would compete in matches where if they lost, they would be kicked out of the group.  This match was a case of ""student vs. teacher"" as Barrett was Jericho's rookie on the first season of NXT.  This was a impressive performance by Barrett in a match that was competitive with both men.
Aug. 16

John Cena vs. The Miz - Sheamus was sitting on the stage area scouting possible opponents for his title defense at Night Of Champions while Miz was heavily upset at Cena for picking Daniel Bryan over him for the elimination match at SummerSlam.  This was a real good match to the point of this is what they SHOULD have had against each other a year earlier with Miz tapping out in the end...but now how you expected.
Aug. 23

Falls Count Anywhere Match: John Morrison vs. Sheamus - This was from the night that ""RAW Roulette"" returned with the special bonus that John Morrison would earn Chris Jericho's spot in the WWE Title match at Night Of Champions if he won here.  These two went all over the place from the ring to the floor & through the crowd before making their way to the stage area with Morrison showcasing his parkor training at various times to land on his feet like a cat & come of the titantron at one point.  This was a great start to the the first in many of a great series between these two.
Sept. 13

Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho - Chris Jericho had something to prove after the issues the had with the General Manager along with his losing streak.  This was a very competitive match between both men that went back & forth with several close near falls & both men finding counters to signature moves.  Sheamus was at ringside & made his presence felt but that didn't work out very well in the end...for Chris Jericho who wasn't seen in WWE since what happened after the match.
Sept. 27

Daniel Bryan vs. Dolph Ziggler - This was a rematch from their ""show stealing"" match at Bragging Rights the night before with the special treat of C.M. Punk coming down to ringside for commentary.  They picked up where they left off from the night before with this match being non-stop action with various moments like Dolph reversing a top rope frankensteiner into a cable while Bryan did a suicide dive onto the outside & ended up hitting the announce table in the process.  Great match in the second of in a three match series during the week.
Oct. 25

King of the Ring Tournament Final: John Morrison vs. Sheamus - A couple of notes here in that Morrison wrestled one more match in the tournament than Sheamus while the ring announcer for this match is the current ""Miss U.S.A."" who is also scheduled to be on the upcoming season of ""WWE Tough Enough.""  These two told a great story with Sheamus taking a page out of the ""Anderson"" playbook by completely focusing on Morrison's arm throughout the match with various moves like a single arm DDT, yanking Morrison off the top rope onto his shoulder, hammerlocks & armbars, and even hitting blocking Morrison's ""Starship Pain"" with knees into his arm.  Morrison gave a good effort but this was all about Sheamus being completely ruthless & becoming King.
Nov. 29

Fatal 4-Way Elimination Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Heath Slater & Justin Gabriel vs. Santino Marella & Vladimir Kozlov vs. Mark Henry & Yoshi Tatsu vs. The Usos - Josh Matthews replaced Michael Cole on commentary here which led to come comedic babbling between those two.  This was about as good as you would expect from the teams involved with this match serving it's purpose in putting over the storylines of Tamina & Santino while Nexus continued to have the same problems with a certain ""fired"" individual.
Dec. 6

(Blu-Ray) Triple H & Randy Orton vs. Sheamus, Cody Rhodes, Ted Dibiase - Orton & Triple H were not only teaming against their opponents at the upcoming WrestleMania but both men weren't only opponents at the previous Mania but rivals for close to 6 years leading to obvious trust issues between both men early on as Triple H refused to even to tag out facing all three men alone causing his opponents to take advantage of distractions & using their numbers advantage resulting in a solid tag match.
Mar. 22

(Blu-Ray) Undertaker vs. Jack Swagger - This was on the ""SmackDown Is RAW"" episode when the RAW superstars were stuck overseas leading to SmackDown's World Champion issuing an open challenge that was answered by Undertaker with him taking advantage working over the arm before Swagger was able to take back control outside of the ring heavily focusing on an area of the body to neutralize Taker's size & power advantage as both men went back & forth exchanging counters in a good match with Swagger definitely holding his own & having an impressive showing against Taker.
Apr. 19

(Blu-Ray) United States Championship Match: R-Truth vs. The Miz - Bret Hart became the new RAW General Manager earlier in the night causing him to vacate the United States Championship he won the previous week leading to this match to declare the new champion with Truth having the early advantage before he ""crash & burned"" allowing Miz to take advantage heavily working over the arm by any means from wrestling offense to utilizing areas of the ring to torture it while Truth continued to fight back with some impactful offense throwing Miz across the ring & coming aerial as both men went back & forth with a series of counters & pin attempts in a very good match.
May 24

(Blu-Ray) Randy Orton vs. Miz - Orton was the #1 contender for the WWE Championship against Sheamus at SummerSlam while Miz was the owner of the Money In The Bank briefcase as Miz attempted to gain momentum early only for Orton to stop it dead before Miz was able to take advantage of a mistiming by Orton focusing on an area of the body to the point where it effected Orton when attempting his own offense allowing Miz to keep on the offense utilizing counters & combinations along with pushing the limits of a possible DQ where the referee had to get physically involved at one point in what was a good showcasing for Miz but the bigger story being who decided to observe the match.
Aug. 2

(Blu-Ray) John Morrison vs. Chris Jericho - The anonymous RAW General Manager put Jericho's spot in the six pack challenge for the WWE Championship at Night Of Champions was on the line here with Jericho attacking at the bell constantly going for quick pins & taking advantage of Morrison hurting a body part while making it clear how frustrated he was wanting to know who the General Manager was as this was a very one sided match with Morrison on defense for a majority of the match but more about pushing the issues between Jericho & the General Manager.
Sept. 6

(Blu-Ray) Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan - The was a non-U.S. Title match with the winner being added to Team RAW at Bragging Rights with Bryan delivering his running knee right at the start & continued to rely on his various leg strikes from a knockout kick to missile dropkick while Sheamus was very physical beating on the back & later the head including repeated kneedrops that knocked Bryan out the previous week as both men would go on to have more famous (and infamous) matches later on in their careers as this was just a solid encounter with both men delivering some physical offense.
Oct. 11

I would have liked to seen the Shawn Michaels retirement speech (which was saved for the next DX set) & the debut of Nexus shown in full instead of just highlights but in the end, I enjoyed this set more than I did the 2009 edition as this had more diversity among the talent while also had a better focus on the actual in-ring wrestling than skits & segments so it's something I would pick up.",1300579200,5,15366,4.526353790613719
