8022772,2,B00026L916,"I like Dylan Thomas but this film doesn't add anything to my appreciation of him.  I also like Richard Burton but he's not enough to save this production.  He plays some enigmatic figure who, accompanied by a cohort, seems to wander around in the little village without drawing any  attention to himself.  I guess he's supposed to be wandering as he reflects on/narrates about the denizens of the village.  But why he's there and how he remains essentially invisible to the locals are not at all clear.  The villagers are portrayed in a highly stylized, cartoonish way that shouts 1970s cinematic ""edginess""; though Peter O'Toole does a good job, pretty much as always.  The music is annoying because it regularly repeats a motif that builds up to a crescendo signifying--nothing that's happening on the screen.  The scene in which all the villagers dance around the village square in their nightclothes is a bit of forced sentimental merriment.  And it's clear from Elizabeth Taylor's voiceover that she wasn't at all familiar with how to use a close-up microphone; her narration is full of mouth-noise pops and clicks.

I guess this makes it sound like I hated everything about the film, which isn't true.  I always like to hear Thomas read aloud, and I like it particularly when Burton's doing the reading, but I don't think I could watch it again.  I suppose I'd do better to listen to a reader's theater production instead.",1466380800,,1428,4.855371900826446
8022773,3,B00026L916,"The video described here is the animated film with voices from the original BBC radio play--Richard Burton; Hugh Griffiths; Rachel Roberts, etc.

The two reviews above relate to the film version of Under Milk Wood that starred Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor!",1151452800,,263,5.261904761904762
8022774,3,B00026L916,"It certainly had a great cast.  But there were problems, big problems.

1. UNDER MILKWOOD was written as a ""play for voices""--for the ratio.  It was originally intended as being what we would call a 'pilot' for a series for the BBC about the goings-on in a small Welsh town where everybody is crazy--some people are mildly eccentric, at least two are right over the edge, and everybody else somewhere inbetween.  It is a good piece for college and community theatre groups because, as a play for voices, there is minimal need for sets, costumes, props, etc., and by doubling roles one can do it with a fairly small cast.

Thomas drank himself to death before the BBC could pick it up.  Why, then, would you make a FILM--a visual medium--of a RADIO PLAY--an audio medium?  The whole idea was flawed from the beginning.

2. That being said, the performances were mostly very good, except for Elizabeth Taylor.  She and Burton were a 'package deal' at the time.  Her performance wasn't exactly BAD, but they cut so much of Rosie Probert's part from the original that one couldn't get a real sense of the character.

3. Which leads me to the next point.  Why did they cut so much?  And, if they made the cuts due to time constraints, why did they add the gratuitous sex scene with ""Norma Jean"", which had NOTHING to do with the play?",1108512000,,1329,4.533613445378151
8022775,5,B00026L916,"If you find yourself laughing when you view this filmed version of UNDER MILK WOOD then good on ya mate, 'cause that's the response Dylan Thomas was looking for.  To be sure, under all the humourous ironies, core qualities of small town Welsh life show through, although the tour group who come to town can't see them from behind their pseudo-sophistication.  This is no, ""Quick trip Marge"", kind of movie.  The moving pictures are woven together with poetic imagery and a rich text which will entertain the viewer as much as a Shakespearian play could over a lifetime.  Except for Elizabeth Taylor, the cast displays timeless class.  See it.  Enjoy it. Savor it.",1085529600,3,663,4.823008849557522
