5733204,4,B00CPTUNNI,"I could have paid $25 for 2 episodes with no english subtitles ordering the Region 2 discs from Japan or I could wait until Shout Factory released this set.  I'll take the Shout Factory release.  You gotta hand it to them for even bothering with a series that is virtually unknown in America and was never shown in America, unlike ULTRA 7 and ULTRAMAN.  My copy looks a little smeary in the faster scenes but it could be that my player is in need of a firmware update so it may not be the fault of whoever mastered this and it may not be Shout Factory's fault because they may have received transfers that originated elsewhere.  You can still buy the Region 2 NTSC discs from Japan.  I think they come as 2 half-hour episodes per disc, and that's 14 discs for the whole set at around $25 a disc.  That's $350 to view discs with no subtitles.  Also there is no guarantee that the Region 2 discs look any better.  I will update my firmware on my player and see if that helps.  Either way, you can't deny that Shout Factory has enabled U.S. audiences to see a show that they might not otherwise be able to see.  For me, this purchase was a no-brainer.",1376697600,6,1148,4.273148148148148
5733205,4,B00CPTUNNI,"The year is 1966. Fresh off the success of special effects films such as Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan, Eiji Tsuburaya decides to form Tsuburaya Productions to produce a series of TV shows that feature monsters on the small screen every episode for once a week and among them was Ultra Q. At that time, the only way to experience monster films in Japan were on the big screen and so for monster lovers, watching monsters on the small screen later became ideal and convenient.

Ultra Q is a very different breast than it's more successful sequel, Ultraman. Granted, both have giant monsters, but they both have different presentation styles and one was filmed in black and white whereas the other was filmed in color. Imagine yourself watching the Japanese equivalent of The Twilight Zone, only with monsters added to the mix. Another way to describe Ultra Q is that it's a series of mini monster movies. Whether the case maybe, Ultra Q is a fun watch and one that fans of Tsuburaya, kaiju and anything above would enjoy.

Like all DVD and Blu-ray sets, there are various positives and negatives. On the plus side, the show on the set is presented in it's original aspect ratio of 4x3 and in black and white; for those who were expecting the colorized versions to be included, they're not. The print for the show appears to be in good shape, with no scratches throughout and is very lite on the grain. Additionally, linear notes are presented on the DVD set itself and not in a booklet and the casing is clear and contains interior artwork inside and artwork of various monsters on the DVD's themselves behind a black background.

The only negatives that are included in the set are the inconsistency in the subtitles and the lack of the English dub. While the subtitles are very accurate to what is being spoken on screen, the monster names are very inconsistent throughout. For example, an episode would say ""Defeat Gomess"" but later in a episode, they would refer the monster as ""Gomesu"". As for the English dub, CBS while acquiring rights to Ultraman also acquired Ultra Q and dubbed both shows, however decides not to air the dub and since then, all the materials were sent but to Tsuburaya Productions and was later featured on the Japanese Laserdisc release. Shout Factory couldn't acquire the dub because of the licencing agreements with Chaiyo Productions (who doesn't own the rights to the dub).",1376524800,3,2401,4.752997601918465
5733206,2,B00CPTUNNI,"This B&W TV show from Japan which originally aired in 1966 is great.  Filled with bizarre monsters, suitmation destruction and surreal moments, it's like a mix of a Godzilla movie and the original Outer Limits (if that show had been geared towards children).  This DVD set is the complete 28 episodes in B&W (the back cover of the DVD set lists it as in color, but it's B&W) with Japanese audio and removable English subtitles.  Shout Factory has this listed on their site as a 6 disc set, but it's only 5 discs.  The only extra, which is on disc 5 and not listed on the cover is a PDF file containing an essay from August Ragone on the development and production of the series.  It's a fleshed out version of the Ultra Q section from his Eiji Tsuburaya book.  This is a nice addition, but it would have been helpful to have a list of episodes somewhere on the packaging, too.  Information on directors, writers and actors for each episode would have also been nice.

With that out of the way we can get into how it looks.  And it doesn't look too good.  Pans and scenes with lots of action result in a stuttering, blurry image (if you pause while this is happening, you'll see a double image/ghosting effect.  I'm not sure why I put the pause bit in as you'll see the same double image/ghosting in motion).  It's very distracting and quite annoying.  Even some simple movements of the actors will result in ghosting/blurs.  I get the same results when viewing on a DVD/TV set up or on my computer.  This set also has issues with the subtitles.  Some go by way too quickly rendering them unreadable (think not even a second for 10 words).  They just vanish from the screen mid-sentence as the actor is still speaking.  Others are on the screen for far too long, and some start way too early.  It's pretty bad timing all-around.  There are also some minor errors (""I can't be sure that is isn't.""  Deep... really deep.) and some of the subtitles make no sense (""It could be a fossilized freshwater clam that has broken no not right.""  Yes).  I've only finished watching the first disc so far, but I've spot checked the other discs and they all have the same picture quality issues listed above.  I'm assuming the subtitle issues will be the same for discs 2-5 as they are on disc 1.  If I'm proven wrong I'll change this review to reflect it.

It should be pointed out that this set only came out yesterday (Aug, 13), so the people who wrote the other 2 reviews in May never even saw the Shout Ultra Q set.  I'm still not quite sure what they've reviewed and rated.",1376438400,37,2564,4.423076923076923

5733263,4,B00CPTUNNI,"before Ultraman, there was Ultra Q.
a kinded giant monsters tv show that was fun to watch back in the good old 1960th. (now that was a long long time ago.)
this is by the same folks who gave us the movies of 'Godzilla', 'Rodan', 'King Kong escape' and *'the Thing' (can U guess who I'm talking about?)
this was 'Toho' way of making a fun giant monster of the week tv show. (which later would give birth to all there Ultraman shows.)
oh! and more more thing, the show was made in B&W only (yet the box say it in color.)
that all I have to say about this item.

[* back in the 1960th there was a movie called Mothra vs. Gojiro (aka: Mothra vs. Godzilla.) anyway when it came time to rename it in english, they rename mothra  as the Thing! and call the movie 'Godzilla vs. the Thing'.]",1434499200,,782,4.1381578947368425
5733264,5,B00CPTUNNI,"As a hardcore kaiju fan I thought I'd seen it all, except for Ultraman stuff, which just has never clicked for me. Ultra Q is a Twilight Zone and X-Files type show that features a monster every week. Since it's made by the same folks responsible for the SFX of the 1960s Godzilla films you'll spot reused monster suits and sound effects. There's only a single monster per episode and no Ultraman type hero, so there's no monster battles. However, I found most of the episodes engaging, especially for a show from 1966.
The A/V quality is more than passable, but far from perfect. Same for the subtitles. The 5 stars is more for how much I loved the show than the presentation. I've seen a couple of the colorized Japanese episodes and they look lovely. It's a shame that version hasn't been released here as I'd gladly double dip for a blu-ray set of those.",1432512000,2,857,4.5

5733266,5,B00CPTUNNI,"worth the money......
while complaints about subtitles , image problems , and lack of booklet are all very much within reason , it is still a very enjoyable set to watch ... the stories are fun , the subs MOSTLY are correct , and mostly able to be read , and the video image quality is good enough to not detract from viewing pleasure....  a lot of the kaijus(monsters) from Ultraman will be shown in a new perspective for english speaking audiences so the fun lies on multiple layers for any Ultraman or Ultraseven fans , and i recommend those series be purchased as well since they are also a very fun viewing adventure

while not perfect in HD standard society viewing and not perfect in subtitle areas , it is very good quality for how old the source negatives or prints are , as well as tsuburaya's notorious multiple overdubbing policies (depending on year , series , video releases and popular language alterations) it's about as good as it will ever get quality-wise and is well worth checking out",1408924800,5,1005,4.5777777777777775

There are a couple of episodes that are surreal and are probably not too many peoples' favorites, but I got a kick out of the kid and his turtle episode.  I can't figure out how someone thought up such a crazy script.
Most of the episodes seem to be almost like Japanese feature films with no middle to them.  Only the ""best"" parts are here.  The monster appears then the monster is killed.  THE END.

5733283,3,B00CPTUNNI,"If you're unfamiliar with the show, ULTRA Q is basically The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, except with giant monsters!  It's a very interesting show and like any TV series there are a few great episodes, some good ones, a lot of OK ones, and a handful of lame ones mixed throughout. The lack of quality in the transfers is what really hurts the show, but that's not exactly Shout! Factory's fault. Due to a lengthy legal battle between Tsuburaya Pro, (the creators of this and ALL shows related to ULTRAMAN), and Thai entrepreneur/thief/A-hole extraordinaire Sompote Sands and his company Chaiyo Productions, the folks at Shout! Factory were forced to use shoddy, piss-poor quality source materials from Chaiyo in order to master this DVD release, rather than pristine original elements direct from Tsuburaya's vaults. Sadly, the result is just so-so, with a lot of annoying artifacting, pixelation and some extremely irritating (and completely unintentional) double-exposure / ghosting / shuttering effects that plague shots whenever the camera pans around. It can, at times, just about drive you crazy. Unfortunately, the same results can be found throughout Shout! Factory's release of the ULTRASEVEN series, too, for the very same reason. The ULTRA Q episodes are all in their original gorgeous black & white, but sadly, no English dubs. It has been reported that English language dubs exist for every episode somewhere, but they're not included here. Although they're only in the original Japanese language, they do include English language subtitles. They're a little crude (and occasionally hard to follow) but for the most part they'll allow you to follow most of what's going.

If you're a fan of ULTRA Q who has been dreaming of a Region 1 release then this set is all you're ever likely to see in our lifetime. If you're merely curious, I think the series IS worth a look, even in this less-than-perfect condition. If you're not sure, or only mildly interested, then just add the show to your Amazon Wishlist and wait for it to drop down to a price that you're comfortable paying ...or buy a used copy, like I did. ;-)",1395360000,6,2134,4.9581005586592175
5733284,4,B00CPTUNNI,"This is the awesome predecessor series to Ultraman, but does not feature any of the giant alien heroes. A great mixture of Night Stalker/Twilight Zone but with Giant monster as only Japan can do them. Not all episodes feature the giants, some are ghost stories, some are straight Twilight Zone type stories, but all are enjoyable. My only gripe is that we didn't have a dubbed soundtrack option, as I've actually seen some of the episodes on youtube that are dubbed. Nevertheless good quality overall and worth the price of admission. LOL.",1393113600,,539,4.869565217391305
5733285,4,B00CPTUNNI,"Ultra Q is a wonderful buy for fans of Kaiju and the Ultraman series. In glorious black and white and featuring suspenseful,funny,and original storys. Think of this as the inspiration to the 70s Kolchak The Night Stalker,The X-files and others. Here you will find clever plots blending gothic Horror,Sci/Fi,and Comedy. This does not feature a superhero like ultraman,but,a group of young people encountering everything from Giant Monsters to Ghosts and fearsome Aliens as well. If You are a fan and love the Ultraman series than this is a must have. Science Fiction Scale 4 out of 5 stars. Why some of the subtitles do race by and some of the scenes are grainy I found this to be in relatively good shape in looks and sounds( Keep in mind I watched this on my 70 inch T.V.) Very entertaining prelude to Ultraman-Kids will eat this up!",1389052800,8,834,4.719178082191781
5733286,5,B00CPTUNNI,"Ultra Q was produced at the height of the giant monster craze in mid-to late 1960's Japan. Some reviewers have stated that it's like the Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits which is not very accurate. The first few episodes feel like unproduced giant monster movies with a photo journalist and a couple of pilots as the mainstay characters. In fact, the first story 'Defeat Gomess' is so much like Godzilla vs. Rodan (a modified Godzilla suit, a giant birds egg, and miners) that it could be easily believed that the episode was directly extrapolated from an unused movie script. Fortunately, Ultra Q gets a lot better as it goes along when the unproduced movie scripts cycle runs out. The main characters are very shallow including a reporter Yuriko who is a flat out wannabe Lois Lane, Jun is a straight man, and Ippei is a side-kick comedy relief for Jun. Despite it's many flaws, there is more than enough good stories such as Baron Spider (a haunted house with a giant spider in it), the 1/8 Project (shrinking down people to create more space in major cities), and Fury of the South Sea (tropical romance peppered with a giant octopus) that it overcomes the flat characters and the hokey effects. I give it five stars because it is one of the few television shows that reach out beyond what it is and succeeds despite it's short comings. The DVD cover says it all. If a member of the audience can get past that stupid looking monster, a diamond in that rough can be found. Check it out.",1388793600,,1491,4.567164179104478

5733312,4,B00CPTUNNI,"GREAT SERIES!!! Way more artistic than I assumed it would be. Thought it would be more kiddy like the rest of the Ultra series, but this is more artsy and out there than I thought.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because when you start each episode, most of the time it starts out with no sound and you have to either start the episode over or rewind it some, and then the sound will go. Weird glitch, but not that big of a deal-- otherwise, really solid series",1384128000,,473,4.086021505376344

This series has been compared to ""The Outer Limits"" and ""The X Files,"" but I find it a bit more appealing because of the giant monster factor. Several of the monsters that appeared in this series, re-appeared on Ultraman in some form or another.

Some episodes feature giant monsters, others feature aliens or supernatural elements.  The show, produced by Eiji Tsuburaya of Godzilla fame, is eerie and atmospheric with plots that do not talk down to the audience, thus making it great for kids and adults.  It is in Japanese with English subtitles and is B&W.  The video and sound quality are perfect (so far - only through 10 episodes, but will trust this holds true).  Best reference for someone who knows nothing about the show is perhaps to describe it as a younger watcher's Outer Limits or Twilight Zone.

Seems like in a few cases the writers just mailed it in or didn't bother aiming for endings that make sense. Anyone familiar with a bit of Japanese mythology will recognize the source material of a handful of episodes. There are plenty of giant monsters to keep a kaiju fan happy - Eiju Tsuburaya is responsible for the show's decent special effects. The three main characters drift in and out of the series, leaving room for the writers to indulge themselves in occasional flights of goofiness.

8584692,5,B00CPTUNNI,"If you are familiar with Godzilla, Gamera, Ultraman then you already know where to start. This is a rich and interesting era between the fall of Japanese fantasy films and the rise of fantasy television.",1523404800,,203,4.828571428571428
8584693,4,B00CPTUNNI,"I picked up Ultra Q after watching the much more popular sequel series, Ultra Man and Ultra Seven.  I knew that it would be very different going into it, so I wasn't disappointed by the lack of an Ultra-style hero.  As a matter of fact, I was happy this show was so different!

Ultraman shows follow a very rigid formula, but since Ultra Q predates all that, it can be pretty unpredictable in its content.  Giant monsters are the most popular, but there are all sorts of other creatures throughout the show that can be human-scale or extremely abstract (including one about a phantom train; no monsters to speak of).  And since there is no central superhero character like Ultraman, the monsters that do show up have to be dispatched in unique ways with each plot; there is no set formula to their defeat.  So each story feels more exciting and the stakes higher; how DO a news reporter, a short fiction author and a mechanic defeat a 100 foot-tall dinosaur?

The show does seem to have a hard time finding its age demographic, though.  There are some extremely juvenile episodes, and by that I mean they utilize cartoon physics where getting blown up by an explosive just launches you harmlessly into space.  Other episodes are horror themed and more mature and death and danger are very real.  There are also episodes, such as the apparently famous one about Okanegon (the coin purse monster) that don't even feature the central cast.  At times you aren't sure if it's supposed to be an episode of the same show or you're left wondering when the cast is gonna pop up (but they never do).

Likewise, Ultra Q can't seem to settle on whether it wants to have an ongoing narrative with main characters or if it wants to be a Twilight Zone style anthology.  So most episodes follow the main cast as they deal with weird monsters or curses, a handful of episodes don't feature the cast at all and are totally disconnected, but other episodes try to have it both ways.  Some end with the main cast in mortal peril as a monster triumphs and looms ever closer, or their hold on reality fades and they begin to drift into oblivion.  But next week, everything is ok.

Ultra Q is definitely unpredictable in both the best and worst ways, but I think that's a strength no matter what.  I found myself getting bored with Ultra Man and Ultra Seven after the formula burned me out, but I plowed my way through Ultra Q and was done before I knew it.  Lots of those classic Tsubaraya effects you have to love going in, but like I said, more variety in the types of effects and monsters than what you'd see in the later Utlra shows.  Ultra Q is a rarity of its genre and all the more worth checking out because of it.",1515542400,2,2700,4.462321792260693

I appreciated the footage of Japan as it was in the early 1960s - a sort of time capsule. Thanks to Shout! Factory for making this available to us Westerners.",1486080000,2,296,4.4

8584698,4,B00CPTUNNI,"Ultra Q was the first and original tokusatsu series produced by Tsuburaya Productions that pre-dates Ultraman.

The show was filmed in black and white and consisted of 28 episodes.

It ran in Japan in 1966, the same year that Ultraman debuted.

The three main characters are Jun Manjome, Ippei Togawa and Yuriko Edogawa.
They make up an investigative team of air pilots and a newspaper reporter.

This show is like the Twilight Zone but with monsters.  It has similarities to the Outer
Limits, X-Files and Kolchak: The Night Stalker.  It deals with supernatural phenomena.

Most of the storylines lack originality and feature many re-hashed horror concepts - we are presented with a giant spider, a colosssal man, a giant ape and a sea creature similar in appearance to the Creature from the Black Lagoon; however, there are a few stories that are pretty
unique.  For instance, one deals with an ancient giant flower that sprouts in the middle of a city.  Another episode deals with two golden eggs that were sent to Earth from Mars that hatch under controlled conditions and turn in to giant Snail-like creatures.

Another interesting story features a female archaeologist that is trying to recover a stolen idol - sound familar?  Bear in mind, that, this story was filmed in 1965, and, Raiders of the Lost Ark was probably filmed in 1980.  Incidentally, the woman in this role is the same actress that portrayed the dark and mysterious woman that was on the bus with Captain Mura (and Ito) during the Dada episode of Ultraman (Human Specimens 5 & 6).

A few of the stories have direct parallels with well-known Twilight Zone episodes.  One, in particular, features a train that can take people away who long for escape from their dull, soulless existences - very much the same plot as the Twilight Zone episode, A Stop At Willoughby.

Keep in mind that this show was aimed at children, so, to watch these shows now, as adults, may seem tiresome, but, they were very inventive and dark for younger audiences.

In some respects, this show is more sober and mature than any of the Ultraman
series that followed it.  It had a darker feel to it, especially in black and white, and, there was less emphasis on comedy.

Also, it is really interesting to watch Ultra Q and the first Ultraman series back-to-back, for those of you who are really in to Ultraman and all the ""Ultra"" series.

To that end, I would like to take the opportunity to recommend some things.  First, be prepared to pause almost constantly because the English subtitles go off the screen really fast.  Watch the series twice, the first time to read everything and the second time to enjoy the visuals in a more relaxed fashion.

Next (for those that have the DVD of the Ultraman series), watch Ultraman with English subtitles.  I failed to mention this in my Amazon review of the Ultraman DVD set.  Some things were reinterpreted and altered for the English dubbed version that we grew up watching as kids.

There are connections between these two Ultra series; however, you have to watch Ultraman with English subtitles to appreciate the connections.

As an example, I mentioned a creature similar to the Creature from the Black Lagoon.  This creature in Ultra Q is, Ragon - this is the same creature that was featured in episode 4 of Ultraman.  In that Ultraman episode, Ito suggests playing music to calm the creature down.  The English dub made no mention that the creature was called, Ragon.  Ragon is a title/name given to a race of amphibious creatures that live in the sea and pre-date humanity.  For you Doctor Who fans it is just like the Silurians.

Well, in the English subtitles of this Ultraman episode the creature was in fact called, Ragon.  It was previously determined in the Ultra Q episode that music helped to tame Ragon, this is why Ito suggested playing music for the ""sea creature"" in the Ultraman episode.

Also, throughout various series of Ultraman you always see a particular monster with a big oval head.  He reminds me a little of the Quisp alien from that old cereal.

You will see this creature in scenes that feature inside shots of toy stores, or, on the shelves in rooms of children, and, also in the credits of the shows themselves; however, we never got to see an Ultraman episode that featured this creature.

Well, the creature is Kanegon, perhaps the most famous creature in the entire Ultra franchise.

Plus, just by looking at the front cover of the Ultra Q DVD you see the creature that we all know as Pigmon.  Except, here, this particular  creature plays a more sinister role and is not the small monster that is friends to all humans (don't you know).

Another thing that connects Ultra Q with Ultraman is the actors and actresses that appear on both shows.  Ultra Q features most of the main character actors from Ultraman except for the actor who played Arashi.

The newspaper reporter, Yuriko, is the same actress that plays, Fuji, from Ultraman.

In this series, she comes off a bit more selfish, opportunistic and cruel.  She is playing a younger, more self-absorbed person.

Finally, there is a lot of music that ties the two shows together because both relied upon the same music composer, Kunio Miyauchi.

It is so cool to hear ""Ultraman music"" in these Ultra Q episodes; between that, and the fact that there are so many familiar faces, it cleary demonstrates the sequel effect between the two shows.

One last thing... the show was dubbed in English around the same time that Ultraman was dubbed but the project was shelved before getting a chance to air in the United States.

I really wish that Tsuburaya Productions would allow releases of this series with English dubbing, as well as the Hawaiian version of UltraSeven here in the U.S.

I also wish that later series of Ultraman would be dubbed in English and released here in DVD/Blu-Ray form.

I can't get enough of these shows!",1480896000,2,5906,4.735553379040157
