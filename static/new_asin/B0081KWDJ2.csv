8523980,5,B0081KWDJ2,"Superb transfer of a pristine print.  Best thing is William Daniels' beautifully composed shots of shadowy downtown LA in 1949.  (He was even greater in his decline at Universal than he was in his prime at MGM in the 30s).  Thanks to the success of THE NAKED CITY, Universal was willing to get out on the streets, which gives the film a satisfying authenticity (there are still process shots from within fake moving vehicles, as expected). The story pushed right up against the Production Code (murdered unwed mothers! human baby trafficking!) and provides a compelling 80-minute viewing experience.  Bonus: Raymond Burr appears partially shirtless!",1484784000,8,649,5.211538461538462
8523981,5,B0081KWDJ2,"Fans of Dennis O'Keefe & Gale Storm will be delighted.
