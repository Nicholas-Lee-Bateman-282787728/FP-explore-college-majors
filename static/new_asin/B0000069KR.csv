7903885,1,B0000069KR,Couldn't watch it; the tape was damaged and harmed my tv player. Thanks for (less than) nothing,1512950400,,95,4.647058823529412
7903886,3,B0000069KR,"Art Carney, Telly Savalas, John Amos, Joe Pantoliano, Ed Lauter, Just to name a few. This movie had alot of people in it. If somebody told me this was a Made For TV movie after I watched it (Without me knowing it 1st) I would've never believed them. This was a 2 part movie & with some multiple part movies, They seem to slow down a bit & get kinda boring but not this 1. This movie had my attention right from the start all the way to the very end. This is not a movie I'd probably watch again anytime soon but if anybody was looking for a movie to watch then I'd tell them to watch Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story. This is a movie worth taking a look at",1423785600,,658,3.992424242424242
7903887,5,B0000069KR,"While this two part T.V. movie is not not totally accurate with the historical facts, it is never the less fun to watch. If you can lay your hands on a copy get it for the Drama And For The Look of Alcatraz 31 Years Ago.",1308355200,2,220,3.8043478260869565
7903888,4,B0000069KR,"The previous reviewer incorrectly (though not by name) identifies this as being the 1980 TV-movie ""Alcatraz - The Whole Shocking Story,"" which it is not, as can clearly be seen by checking the pictures here on Amazon and the accompanying information. That said, this IS an interesting 1977 made-for-TV documentary narrated by William Conrad (TV's 'Cannon') and covering the history of the infamous island prison. Worth checking out if you can track down a copy of this rarity.",1253059200,,476,5.115384615384615
7903889,5,B0000069KR,"This is not only one of the best TV movies ever but in my opinion one of the best Movies ever. This two part movie is based on the life of Clarence Carnes the youngest inmate ever sent to Alcatraz. The first part deals with Carnes and the 1946 Battle of Alcatraz. Carnes along with Bernard Coy,Joe Cretzer,Marvin Hubbard,Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson take over the prison for 3 days in an escape attempt that turns deadly ( I will leave out the facts as not to spoil the movie for you) Part 2 deals with Carnes involment with Frank Morris and the Anglin Brothers in the 1962 Escape From Alcatraz. This movie is one of the rarest ever. Part one and two shown in the picture on VHS can fetch well over $200.00 and part one alone has gone for over $100.00. I just hope that most people were able to catch it on the Encore True Stories channel a couple of years ago. I own Part 1 and 2 shown here Part one alone (different cover) and a great transfer on DVD-R with menus and everything. If you are an Alcatraz junkie like myself pay the money to buy this, you can turn around a relist it on Ebay or Amazon and make your money back or have them in you collection like myself. This movie and Six Against the Rock (another made for TV movie that is out on DVD) are the two movies that stick pretty much to the facts, the two mainstreem movies(Escape From Alcatraz and Murder in the First) while great movies do not stick to the facts. For an Alcatraz historian as myself this movie ranks #1. I watch it every week.",1189036800,8,1509,4.224913494809688
