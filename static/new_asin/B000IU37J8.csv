8147364,4,B000IU37J8,"This an amazing documentary of 'choro' - the urban expression of Brazilian sounds.
Informative, historic, interesting, but above all - enjoyable to lovers of Brazilian and tropical sounds.
The setting is informal, filmed on site while many Brazilian legends performed, some in their earlier days, other as mature, well respected musicians. An extraordinary cast of talented artists - not just musicians, but artists. Improvisation, creativity, teamwork, passion - all reflected in this production. Visual quality is only ok (produced in 2007), sound quality is good, but the experience of 'hearing from the masters' is absolutely unique.  Produced from a film by Mika Kaurismaki of same name.
Well worth adding to any collection of Brazilian music.",1405468800,,748,5.504347826086956

8147373,5,B000IU37J8,"An absolute must for any classical guitarist, mandolin player, ethnomusicologist or anyone in need of a musical revival.  Yamandu is at an almost spiritual level of one-ness with his seven string guitar.  I wonder though why Jacob Do Bandolim is not mentioned, where his compositions feature strongly.",1180656000,7,301,5.382978723404255
