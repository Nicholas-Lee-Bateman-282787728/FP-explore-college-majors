811802,5,6304227531,"Well this was a surprise.  I bought this videos during the first wave of ""Pilates"" and figured it would be a nice mix of Yoga and Pilates.  I was amazed at how Jenniger Kries skillfully blends to two into a real  intense workout.  You feel every area each workout intends to hit.  It does  take a few sessions to get the positions and forms down but once you  do...lookout!!!!!",928972800,8,377,4.3768115942028984
811803,5,6304227531,"This video is thorough, well-paced, challenging. The muscle workout leaves you tender, but not sore in the traditional ways many work-out videos do. Perhaps the most surprising benefit is that my body actually feels  different/better on the days I follow this routine. After you have done  this workout once, you will know clearly that Jennifer's promise that you  will ""feel taller"" is 100% accurate. Kudos to Jennifer!",916790400,3,420,5.2388059701492535
812051,5,6304227531,"This is a great video! I cant say enough good things. I just had a baby and was in a car accident while pregnant resulting in back injuries. I thought Pilates may not be for me because I was so out of shape and injured. Definatly not the case! Another person said there were no modifications to the moves and you had to be fairly fit to even try this work out. Not so!! Several times she says to go only as far as comfortable, you have to follow her directions- then you have a completly tailored work out.
True there isn't a whole lot for arms...but I have a baby for that!",1074729600,2,574,4.088495575221239
812052,5,6304227531,"This is a great workout that targets your tummy but also tones up your thighs, legs & buttocks. I fast forward to the second workout (which is more rigorous) after I went through the tape the 1st time. The 2nd workout is abut 40 minutes & all of it is done while you are on the floor (great huh?). My body looked slimmer after the 1st 5 times! I feel absolutely great after doing it & nowadays I lie down in front of the TV in the evening & do the exercises ( I wrote a brief description & number of repetitions on a piece of paper to help me keep track).
If you want a good workout to help you get in shape and one that you can easily follow this is the one for you. Don't get me wrong, this workout is very chalanging.
Try out Pilates Precision Sculpting which targets the upper body & arms for that slender arm look ;)",1062115200,4,821,4.012195121951219
812053,5,6304227531,"Wonderful video.  I always go back to this video, as it is my favorite.  If I don't have time I just do the beginning 15 minutes.  If I do have time I can do the 30 minutes that follow.  I usually like to break up this video.  That is 15 minutes, 30 minutes and the last 15 as side series.",1054080000,,289,3.75
812054,5,6304227531,"Best workout tape I've used.  I like the slow pace of the tape.  It contrasts the ridiculous 'always on the go, no time for anything' society we live in.  I like Jennifer Kries' low key personality.  She is straight forward.  She does, contrary to other reviews, positively reinforce throughout the video.  She encourages you to focus on your stomach in a uniquely thoughtful approach which promotes attention to Self as opposed to mere attention on losing weight or other equally dubious motivations. As for ""showing off"", I never looked at her leg stretching as showing off.  I think it's good that she does it and it always makes me think I can do that if I keep practicing.  She is basically stretching the limits of your expectations in doing it.  A person's own sense of futility and jealousy will interpret showing off.
I always feel relaxed and strong and taller immediately after doing this video.  The video seems to be best suited for people willing to take time, focus, and work to achieve results.  Not for fast food nation, gotta have it now with as little effort as possible people.  I highly recomend this to my friends and to anyone.",1050537600,7,1150,4.695
812055,4,6304227531,"I like this workout and felt results immediately. I've never taken a Pilates class, but I understand this is pretty close, if not identical, to Pilates techniques, so I'm not sure why Jennifer Kries is taking so much credit.
I also want to tweak her head off when she says she's working out both legs because her method relies on symmetry -- as if other methods only work one side of the body. And what's with the ""Classic Method Rollup""? It's not a ""classic"" if it's a new method. Is it a classic Pilates rollup?
Time will tell if Kries gets less irritating to me over repeated viewings, or if I finally get a straight-on Pilates video to replace this.",1041206400,,653,4.45
812056,3,6304227531,"This is a fine tape.  It's a good workout (and if you have limited time or are pairing this kind of exercise with cardio, you can just do the short intro and still get some benefit) and I'm sure that it's done some people a lot of good.
That said, certain things about it annoy me to no end.  First off, all these workouts that claim to be ""based on"" Pilates but in some way improved by the genius instructor making the tape are kind of offensive.  I've done a few varieties of them.  Some bear almost no resemblance to actual Pilates and I think put you in real danger of injury.  Others, like this one, are 99% Pilates with one thing changed so that the instructor can promote herself as having invented a workout technique.  This tape is Pilates -- the editorial review Amazon[.com] provides says it's ""based on yoga, classical dance, and the work of Joseph Pilates,"" but you know what? The work of Joseph Pilates, i.e. Pilates, was based to some extent on yoga and classical dance.  Jennifer Kries can attribute a move to yoga, but if everything else she's doing is Pilates, and that yoga move is done in Pilates classes, well, you do the math.
With that in mind, I've taken some Pilates classes, and I own both Ana Caban mat workouts, and with that experience I can say that I don't think Jennifer Kries is a great teacher.  Not terrible -- she's not going to hurt you and you'll learn a lot of the basics from her -- just not great.  Breathing is a big part of Pilates and she isn't always clear about when you should be inhaling or exhaling; similarly she doesn't always emphasize correct back positions at times when I think most of us are probably doing the exercises a little wrong.
Third, as my friend who owns the video and who I did the workout with pointed out, Jennifer Kries cannot count.  ""Ok, eight more!"" she'll say, and 13 repetitions later she tells you to stop.  That may seem like and in many ways is a minor point, but it's the sort of thing that drives you nuts the 40th time you do a tape.
Fourth, Kries is indeed very flexible.  So much so that it kind of gets in the way of the workout.  I'm happy for her that she can hook her ankles behind her ears, but it's kind of distracting to have your jaw drop open when she does it in the middle of an exercise that doesn't require anything like that kind of flexibility.  She's just showing off and it adds nothing to, may even detract from, what I get from the tape.
In summary, you could DEFINITELY do a lot worse, and this is not a bad workout.  It will help you build strength and flexibility for sure.  But you could do better, with Ana Caban for instance.",1036972800,21,2633,4.310344827586207
812057,1,6304227531,"This tape is not for beginners. I consider myself a perfectly fit girl, I work out 4 times a week at the gym but I found this tape impossible. In addition to being lousy and boring, the transitions are not that smooth. She talks between counting and you never know whether you should still be holding your breath or relaxing. When she started showing off her advanced moves like that of a professional ballerina, I knew I shouldn't have bought this. Nonetheless, I got a good ab workout which I could have achieved with other ab specific tapes. Ms Kries is boring as an instructor and I found her a little annoying and in her counting and giving of directions. I found myself saying ""get on with it!"" a couple of times.",1036454400,,719,4.454545454545454
812058,5,6304227531,"I have had this tape for almost two years and I can't say that I love Pilates as much as I love this tape.  Warning:  this is not easy and there are mornings which I have to psych myself up before getting out of bed to put the old leotards on to do it.  ... But, it is well worth the effort.
This does not substitute for cardiovascular workouts like some folks would have you believe.  However, I find that employing some of the techniques learned on this tape while I do other forms of exercise have benefited me immensely. Learning that the abdomen is the center of the body and that all movement comes forth from is a profound revelation for me.  As I have progressed from week to week, I feel the differences in my body, my posture is better; I feel stronger and more supple.  ...
Jennifer's personality is a big plus on this sort of a program--she is encouraging, friendly and no nonsense, all at the same time.  Don't be intimidated by the marvelous flexibility of her body; no one expects beginners or even intermediates like myself to stretch a straight leg over their head to touch the floor.
There are two sessions--one a short 15 minute warm-up where Jennifer explains the basics; yes, at times after doing this tape for over two years, some of the instructions are repetitive, but as this is not aerobic exercise and the flow from exercise to exercise is pretty quick and even paced, I don't see this as much of a problem.  The second program lasts over 40 minutes--at first it is a real killer---when I first did this, I could not move the next morning--the pain in my abs was so intense, but as you continue to persevere, it seems less overwhelming and more invigorating.  The 'side series' is particularly a great set of elongating leg exercises that are fun to do and provides a good respite before tackling the 'Teaser', the tapes only really advanced move.
I don't recommend doing this every day.  You'll get burnt out.  Mix it up with other forms of exercise  Brian Kest's Power Yoga #1 tape is a great alternative if you insist on working out in front of the TV. Billy Blanks Tae Bo Advanced series is unbeatable for motivation and an all around dynamic workout. If you get around to doing this tape once a week, I think it is sufficient, as long as you are exercising in other ways the rest of the time. The key is to keep moving!",1035244800,2,2351,4.4292343387471
812059,5,6304227531,"This is a great tape for anybody who is interested in getting a good posture and a lean body. I am  65 years old,not very fit(I walk every day and do ""Firm ""  tapes occasionally).This tape is an eye opener. It was not easy at the beginning,but after three weeks(I do Pilates every other day) I look leaner and my clothes fit better. I can do almost all of her excercizes on the tape,except""teaser"",but,my young friends,just wait:I WILL DO IT.
Jennifer is not arrogant,she is just shy and sometimes she says something that seems out of place. She is our own,great American ballerina and a great atlete. Try this tape,don't listen to the negative remarks. Reach for the stars.",1033430400,4,674,4.65546218487395
812161,4,6304227531,"I really enjoyed this video. I had taken a few pilates classes at my gym, and this was very much the same. If you focus carefully on your movements, this can be a great workout for the abdomen, legs, and arms. The problems are that she does not focus at all on breathing, and does not really tell you how to breathe. She says you can do it when you get better, but obviously you would have to use a different tape or something. Also, there is no way to know when the instructional part in the beginning has ended and when the actual workout starts. You can really do them back to back for the best workout, but it is very long. She is wearing the same clothes and it has the same background, so unless you know the tape really well, you have to fast forward and rewind for a long time until you figure out where the actual workout begins. Very annoying, but a good workout overall.",1031443200,,881,4.188235294117647
812162,2,6304227531,"I consider myself a fairly fit and flexible person.  I do some sort of exercise everyday.  I have covered Tae Bo, ballet, step aerobics, Yoga, running, and swimming.  When a friend mentioned Pilates, I thought, ""Oh, good, something new.""  I think the concept is a wonderful idea and I can see how this would really strenghten your body.  However, I wanted to throw the remote control at the TV while doing the video.
Jennifer Kries has obviously been doing this a while.  Very few people, no matter how fit they are, are able to do what she does in the first several attempts at this video.  She shows you the beginning way to do something, but automatically assumes that everybody can pull up their body using just their abs the first few times.  Watching her do this effortlessly made me feel like a lazy blob.  Also, she stretches her legs up behind her head.  I can fold my legs wierd ways, too.  But not that extreme.  You get the feeling she is showing off.  I inished this video feeling very frustrated and incompetent.
This could be a wonderful workout for your stomach, but I do not recommend it for anybody who needs positive reinforcement.",1029888000,7,1150,4.578431372549019
812163,1,6304227531,"I read the back of this video and it sounded encouraging with emphasis on the body parts that I wanted to work out. However, halfway through the video, I wanted to quit.
I assume the first part of the tape is for beginners. It was okay. After doing the first part, I didn't feel as if I had worked out though.
The second part of the tape was too long and she kept doing the moves too fast that I couldn't do it properly. The moves were definitely too hard to perform the first time and I felt as though I knew I was doing something wrong, but didn't know what. Jennifer does an okay job in giving cues, but she doesn't remind people to inhale and exhale everytime. Sometimes, I didn't have time to breath.
Even though she reminds people that they won't be able to do the moves as far as she does, I still felt intimidated at how high her legs stretched. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't done pilates before.",1029369600,2,932,4.271186440677966
812164,2,6304227531,"I bought the Precision toning, and Precision Sculpting tapes years ago, before the Pilates craze started. I had been doing yoga for years and also Callanetics and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the tapes just never lived up to the expectations I had.
I wanted a workout that 1) wouldnt bother my back and 2) would reshape my body with a mat workout. I had done callanetics for years as a teenager and had been thrilled with the results, when I learned that this was a popular workout with celebrities I didn't think I could go wrong.
If you want to get toned from Pilates you truly need to invest the money in a trainer and use a machine, these tapes are not effective enough. Ive tried several of the method tapes besides these and they were never ""enough"" for me.
If you already excersize regularly like I do (1-2 hours a day 5 days a week) then you just won't get much results from these ""light"" movements. If you are a beginner and want to try something new, then these may be good for you. If you really want to get a leaner body and strengthen muscles you never knew you had, try callanetics. Ive been doing it off and on for 8 years and its never failed to give me the results I wanted.",1026950400,7,1202,4.276315789473684

812166,4,6304227531,"This is an excellent workout, and it clearly explains how to do the different moves, however it is hard enough that I would not recommend it as a first pilates tape.  It might be better to get into pilates with the Anna Cabon tape, build familiarity and strength for a month or two, and then move on to this tape.",1008547200,6,313,4.216666666666667
812167,4,6304227531,"I have been doing Pilates type exercises for some time now. I started with Denise Austin and recently bought this tape.  I still do my Denise Austin tape, even though she is a bit annoying.  I like this tape alot.  It is easy to follow and a good workout.  The one thing I do not like is the fact that it says the total running time is 50 minutes, with the first workout ""Toning Essentials"" being 15 (which is pretty accurate) and the second workout ""Method Toning"" being 30.  Method Toning is 49 minutes from start to finish!  The first time I did the workout I noticed how long it seemed.  After 3 more times of timing it with the VCR it is indeed well over 45 minutes.  I don't know how this could have slipped by the production company or the other reviewers!  That is the only major drawback for the work out.",997142400,5,814,4.233766233766234

812169,1,6304227531,"I have been doing Pilates for 6 mos. I swear by it and will allways have it in my life. But this tape is terrible. It seems like a showoff tape for the skills of Jennifer Kreis and has little in the way of accurate instruction. I have tried several tapes (Denise Austin is the best) and a great book- Brook Siler's Pilates....but Jeniifer Kries takes the cake as the worst one. Give pilates a shot, its awesome!!!

812219,3,6304227531,"I've been trying yoga and Pilates to expand my exercise program lately and have viewed several tapes in both areas. This was a good tape but I felt it was a little ""slick"". For some reason I always felt just a bit behind as a beginner. Maybe I'll grow into the tape but it just seemed a bit too oriented toward the ""hip, young, and already flexible"" crowd for a middle aged athletic woman to really appreciate.",995760000,3,410,4.337662337662338
812220,4,6304227531,"This is one of the best work out videos I have ever owned. The moves are challenging, but Jennifer is a great coach. As you become stronger it's almost as though the video moves with you. Is the video difficult? YES! Though the moves are simple, don't expect to do every move the first time you watch this tape. The first time I did the tape I was shocked at the things this woman does... but rather than discourage you, the progress you make really motivates you to continue. The ONLY downfall to this tape is that after doing it regularly for several months, Jennifer really does get a bit wordy. You will want something a bit faster paced at that point and there are some new METHOD tapes that fit that need. But if you haven't done Pilates before I recommend beginning with this one.",994550400,2,787,4.397260273972603
812221,2,6304227531,I'm not saying this is not a great tape. I think that she has these moves mastered. I'm just saying that Pilates is not for me. I am a vocalist and some of the breathing techniques in Pilates are counter-productive for me. I spoke to an instructor and she seemed to think that they were not but how can you hold your abdomen in and get a good breath going?,992995200,,356,4.1
812222,4,6304227531,"I'm happy with the video, with the exercises in it, the time spent on each on them, the explanations and the continuous  reminders about how to correct my posture during the exercises..
... however...
I've taken a few months of Pilates with a live instructor, who continously would watch my posture and adjust here and there. The Pilates exercises are about precision, and even with the best video instruction it is impossible to achieve perfect posture during exercises. Only a trained eye watching you from outside could correct you. This is why I cannot give the video 5 stars. A video cannot tell you whether you're doing something correctly or not. A mirror could help, but not always.
Another problem I have with the video is about how the exercises  evolve from one to another. From what I remember from a year ago when I was taking the Pilates class, as I progressed the exercises were changed to challenge me, slowly. I think the video would have benefitted from taking an approach that is already popular in many exercises videos, having two or more people in the background demonstrating different levels of the same exercise. For instance, ""rolling like a ball"" has many levels of difficulty (how hard you hold the knees with your hands, the placement of your hands on your shins or knees, etc) which slowly progress until you reach the level where you can do the modified feet-in-the-air version. In the video, this is not clear.
Also, I think that more information about how to use breathing in the exercises would have helped quite alot.
For myself, this is a great video, because I'm already familiar with the exercises , and this is a great combination. I like the set, the instructor, and I hope I'll stick with exercising :)

812225,5,6304227531,"I had taken one Pilates mat work class before purchasing this video, and I wish I had bought the video eons ago.  You don't need any special equipment (though a workout mat between you and the carpeting is a good idea).
While the tape is not so easy that you can do the entire workout the first time through, I like this because it provides me with some incentive and motivation to work up to harder material.  Personally, I hate it when the tape is so easy I can do it all by the second or third time--I get bored, and feel like I have wasted my money.
After just a few workouts, I notice a definite difference in my posture.  (I had to adjust the rear view mirror in my car, for one!).  Contrary to other reviewers, if you do the exercises and follow the directions, you WILL end up with strong abs and a tight rear.  The essence of Pilates focuses on ""the powerhouse"" which includes the abs and lower back; this area supports your entire body.  Note, however, that there are a few moves in this tape that were taken from dance and/or yoga--it isn't strictly Pilates.
In October, a federal court overturned the trademark status of the word ""Pilates,"" which means that anyone can declare that they teach ""Pilates"" even if they have no training in the technique.  The instructor in this tape does have a Pilates training program under her belt, and it shows.  The instructions and reminders are fantastic, but not cheerleader-peppy like most aerobic workout vidoes, and not condescending like most weight workout videos.

812227,3,6304227531,"I have been using ""The Pilates Body"" by Brooke Siler for my Pilates workout.  I'm glad I started with this book instead of this tape, because I think that people that start with this tape will be quickly discouraged.
My main complaint with this tape, though it does an excellent job of describing the exercises is that it mixes advanced and beginner moves in the same workout.  One thing that Pilates Body by Brooke Siler does is isolate those workouts, so you can begin at your own pace. You can do just the beginners exercises first and work up to the more advanced ones later.  Let's face it, we are not all built like this girl or likely to be.
Also this tape does not give you a sense of which exercise goes into which.  I don't know if this is typical in exercise tapes as this is the first exercise tape I've owned.  However what I like to have is a list of specific exercises and what comes after what.  The tape instersperses exercise with stretches so that when following it you are likely to lose track.  I wish she would show a break in the exercises and give a list, or this tape was bundled with a book.  Also at times she does not give you an idea how many repetitions to do for each exercise.
The reason I bought the tape, is one of the very minor shortcomings of ""The Pilates Body"" and it is only because it is a book, it cannot show movement as well as a video.  I was unsure I was doing the breathing on ""The Hundred"" correctly and the speed of the curl up right.  Come to find out, I was doing ""The Hundred"" incorrectly but effectively enough and the curl up much faster than I should have.  All in all, ""The Pilates Body"" being a book did well by me regardless.
If you have bought this tape and gotten frustrated with Pilates, go out and buy the Pilates Body by Brooke Siler and you will be much happier.",972000000,42,1825,4.230547550432276

I was already bulky as it was.  This tape changed my  life.  I have fibromyalgia so finding a low impact aerobic and weight  lifting routine was hard ( at least one that was interesting).  This was  perfect.  I worked on the first 15 minute introduction and moved on to the  30 minute section.  It strengthened my back and whittled away my waist and  hips and got rid of the bulky legs.  I like the personal effect of this  tape, no extras and no music, just you and Jennifer Kries.  Man she is  excellent and amazing to watch.  At first it was kind of intimidating, but  after a couple of weeks I could do almost as well as her.  My back pain  decreased,  I looked better, felt great and my posture was excellent.

812282,5,6304227531,"I had the pleasure of taking classes with Jennifer in Philly and she is so inspiring.  When I moved away from Pennsylvania, I was sad to give up my classes and flexibility. Needless to say, I am thrilled to have Jennifer  teaching me again.  I have all of her tapes...the best benefits are  increased flexibility, increased ab strength and BETTER posture. A few  weeks with this tape and you'll be looking like a ballerina! It's important  to keep your spine in contact with the floor and your abs engaged,  otherwise you may strain your back. This tape is not for wimps. Love it!",964396800,2,580,4.572815533980583
812283,2,6304227531,The excercises really do work but the sound quality on my tape is so poor that it is difficult to hear even with the sound cranked up. I ordered this tape out of a magazine and had no idea when I paid $34.99 that the qaulity  would be so bad.,961027200,,242,3.84
812284,5,6304227531,"I dabbled with the Pilates method, trying to get the information from a couple of the books, but it wasn't until I started working with Kreis's video that the changes began in earnest. I did parts of her workout every  day and voila! And it took only a few weeks for that recalcitrant area, the  gut, to shrink back. I'm over 65 and have always done some exercise (not a  fanatic, however), but I never experienced such dramatic change. Then when  my massage therapist, who sees my body every week, started commenting about  the increased tone and shapeliness of my old frame, well, I just had to  write a review.  I am still at it, and feel good. My back, which from time  to time gives me a pang, is behaving itself. I sleep well, and even places  that I didn't know I was exercising are looking better (for instance, my  shoulders). (And I just bought the video for my granddaughter.)",960508800,25,887,4.453416149068323
812285,5,6304227531,This video is great for all ages and fitness levels and still provides a challenge for the more advanced.  I finally had a goal to work towards and show me how much I had advanced.  Jennifer Kries method really works for a  great looking toned body.  I've recommended this video to many of my  friends.,960249600,,302,4.418181818181818
812286,4,6304227531,"Having ""done it all"" (every aerobics class imaginable, step, stair climbing, weight lifting, fast walking, kickboxing), I was looking for something new and different to try.  Boy, did I find it here.  Don't  let Jennifer Kries' low-key manner lull you into thinking this is a wussie  workout!  You may not be panting and sweating when it's over, but the  following day you will get up sore in places that will shock you.  I  actually had soreness in my triceps, something I've not experienced in all  my work with weights and machines.  The only reason I can't give this video  5 stars is I feel the ""roll-up"" exercises could cause back  problems, especially if your abs aren't in the greatest shape.  I felt some  lower-back twinges the day after I first tried this tape, and I have NO  history of back pain whatsoever.",959731200,25,820,4.676056338028169
812287,5,6304227531,"Do not let the cover of this tape intimidate you!  It looks wild, but it can happen to you!  I just purchased this tape, and have done it only 5 times, but I have to say this is one of the best video workouts one could  buy.  I've done it all, the step reebok, buns/abs/insert-body-part-here of  steel, denise austin, etc..etc...This does not have any of those ridiculous  moves where you spend more energy crimping your neck, trying to look at the  TV monitor because you're attempting to figure out what fancy hip-hop move  they're doing only to realize you've reached the end of the work-out with a  less than satisfying feeling!  Although this tape is not your average  aerobic workout with booming bass in the background, you will definitely  experience a GREAT workout.  This utilizes slow, carefully thought out  precision movements which, when done properly, will have you feeling  stronger, leaner, and longer.  The first 1-2 times you run thru this, it's  difficult, I won't lie to you.  But you will get hooked on that ""I  just worked out, and I worked out HARD"" feeling, that you will want to  continue.  Some days I did just the 15 minute segment and I found that to  be sufficient.  That 15 minutes also makes a great warm-up first thing in  the morning, or just before you go on a brisk walk or jog.  Even my husband  loves this tape and he is a 6 foot 200 pound weekend warrior who loves to  lift weights, run, row, and jump rope.  He says it has added greatly to his  flexibility which has improved his overall workout.  You will feel a huge  difference in your abdominal strength after just 5 run thrus, I know I did!",957139200,104,1635,4.515463917525773
812288,5,6304227531,"After spending a lot of money for a Pilates instructor, I decided to try Precision Toning. I liked the tape even better than my expensive Pilates class! I've been using this tape for 3 weeks (4 times a week) and have  noticed a difference in my abs especially. I've never been bored with Kries  and find her methods soothing and encouraging (while challenging). I'm  planning on purchasing the rest of her series!",949968000,10,413,4.708333333333333
812289,4,6304227531,"I found this tape to be a refreshing change from the aerobics and yoga videos I normally use. The exercises were very interesting and challenging and never made me feel bored. I noticed results after a few sessions. I  felt taller and stronger and even  more flexible. My only complaint is that  the tape is marketed for beginners, too, and I was a beginner and found  some of the moves a bit difficult at first. However, if you stick with it,  as Jennifer says in the video, you will notice results in a few sessions. I  have pretty weak abs, but after a few times I mastered the ab exercises  which I thought would never happen! I was pretty sore the day after I did  the tape the first time, so be warned if you have out of shape abs.  Jennifer is a great instructor and not at all annoying!",949363200,60,794,4.24

I love it so much I used to make anyone who visited me, do it with me no matter their age, exercise habits, or face they gave me when I mentioned they would be joining me.",1330128000,,455,3.75
7865303,5,6304227531,"This is without a doubt...the best video I have ever bought!  Jennifer Kries is a very good instructor.  I sweat more doing this 45 minute tape, than ridding the stationary bike for an hour.  Through my own experiance, you MUST regularly do this tape for at least 2 months before you will REALLY see results.  I think I spent the first 2 months mastering the different moves.  Then when I had done so...I could start concentrating on feeling the burn in my muscles.  This tape WILL change the shape of your body...and you will see a difference, but you must stick with it.  The Method Precision Sculpting video is also really good.  I have been incorporating both tapes into my routine...and seeing the results I want.",1083196800,8,718,4.642857142857143
7865304,3,6304227531,"I kind of like this workout.  It is somewhat challenging, although I get bored with it quickly.  I'm not particularly fond of Jennifer Kries' teaching methods either.  I don't doubt that she is skilled in what she does, she's just very bland, as is the workout and the appearance of the set.  This was the first pilates video I bought. I did it a couple of times, and then didn't do pilates again for almost a year.  I would suggest starting with Ana Caban's beginners video if you are new to pilates.",1075680000,8,501,4.4021739130434785
