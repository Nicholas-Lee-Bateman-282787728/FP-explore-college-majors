1830910,5,B0000897EH,"A modern, upbeat romantic comedy that had my husband and myself laughing and thoroughly engaged from start to finish. Beautifully directed and acted with a light, human touch sadly missing from many films these days. Hilarious dialogue as Lucy navigates through a series of blind dates with a wide assortment of eligible bachelors. Reading the other reviews on this site, I'm surprised that others failed to mention how FUNNY this movie is. We and our friends all loved it.",1057536000,,473,5.0

1830912,3,B0000897EH,"I'm With Lucy is a recent romantic comedy starring the little known comic actress Monica Potter, who looks slightly like a blonde Julia Roberts.
The film's premise is that the newly-single Lucy (Potter) goes on dates with five different men to see if any of them will work out better with her than her ex, who dumps her in a humiliating fashion during the first few frames of the film in an elevator in front of a bunch of strangers. This was the first sign for me that something was 'off' in this film. Many facets of it, especially in the first half-hour to an hour were frankly a little strange/not very well-thought out... by that I mean a distinct lack of realism, both in the acting and the situations presented. For example, who would really break up with someone, without looking at them (looking straight ahead, at the camera), while giving them a list of personal, embarrassing reasons they were doing so, in front of an elevator full of people they don't know? When Lucy meets her parents on the street with one of her dates, too, her expression is not one we would associate with someone meeting their parents by chance on the street.. she looks at them like they are strangers.
The first 'dates' fly by, you see one brief exchange between Lucy and a man, a few lines of dialogue at most, then it's 'on to the next.' As I was watching these, I thought to myself, god where's the director, the editor, the acting coach, it was awful.. but then, after a while, things started to come together and you do see Lucy back on each date, with each different man, in different situations and with different problems/solutions/comic exchanges in each. So it did get better, thank goodness!
Another quirky thing was the timing.. in the cases of most of the men, the outing was supposed to have been only one 'date'.. yet the film showed the two (for each segment) doing like five things in a row, very unlikely for a first 'date.' Ie: going on a long drive, fishing, playing tennis, at a beach, etc... all in the daylight.. strange. The timing just never felt quite right, it started to feel too much like a film, and I was focusing on that too much for it to have been done well overall (watching a really good, engaging film, I find, one forgets that one is watching a film at all, until the film ends and the credits start to roll.. and not a moment before).. so this irked me quite a bit.
One more complaint is that the secondary characters, especially Lucy's female friends, were introduced for long enough in the beginning for us to expect that they would stay in the picture longer, so to speak, but they fell off the radar completely and didn't really return til the very last scene.. another fault in directing/editing I would say.
That said, the movie grew on me quite a bit as it went along, and with some of the most talented male actors around as Lucy's five dates, there was a lot to work with, and the film came together by the end (to an extent).
Standouts in the male actors would be Gael Garcia Bernal, the gorgeous Mexican actor (Y Tu Mama Tambien) who here plays a sexy playwright with a very cool (but again, also very unrealistic/unlikely) pad complete with a stream running through it and a host of tropical plants. His extremely sensual and sexy character has no problem bedding down with Lucy, and he does, again and again. She starts to wonder if there might be more to a relationship, however, and though she enjoys their encounter, seems to get a little bored with it all. The funniest/best/most classic scene in the film shows her and Bernal in post-coital bliss for the umpteenth time.. and they start talking about one of his plays. She asks him, ""so, there was this one character, he also does something you do,"" (I forget what it was) and he says, ""yes, it was an autobiographical play."" ""And the character's name was the same as yours,"" she says. ""Yes,"" he says, deadpan. ""And he believed he was the incarnation of Julius Caesar,"" ""Uh.. yes.."" he says in his sweet Mexican accent. Needless to say, very soon in another scene in his kitchen as the two are preparing dinner together, she says, quite expectedly, ""I think we need to get to know each other a little better."" Too much time between the sheets and not enough talking made for an interesting situation, to say the least. Bernal played his part quite well, and I look forward to seeing more of his work in American films.
The other standout bloke was Henry Thomas (yes, *that* Henry Thomas (of ET fame)), who was appropriately sweet, cute, and mellow and truly cared for Lucy. The more he was in the film, the better it got, and the relationship between the two of them was quite believable.
Other actors in the film were the usually likeable, talented Anthony LaPaglia (of tv's Without a Trace), in a really annoying but somewhat funny role as an aging baseball icon, tv actor David Boreanaz, and the Scottish actor John Hannah (Sliding Doors, Four Weddings and a Funeral).
I give it 2 1/2 stars, and for the patient romantic comedy buff, it could be worth a watch.",1053302400,3,5059,4.536105032822757
1830913,4,B0000897EH,"Jon Sherman directs Eric Pomerance's first credited screenplay in this romantic romp.  Monica Potter who was both convincing & chilling in the tense ""Along Came a Spider"" with Morgan Freeman shows that she has a flair for romantic comedy.  Her role here as a lead is different from her supporting roles with Robin Williams in ""Patch Adams"" and as Nicholas Cage's wife in ""Con Air.""  Because of her voice and mannerisms, she will unfortunately probably be referred to as ""the blonde Julia Roberts""; but Monica is quite good in her own right.  For those who love this genre, this is a fairly good outing.  The revelation for me was Henry Thomas as a delightful romantic lead.  He certainly has grown up since the days when the world watched him as Elliott in E.T.; and although he's worked steadily, he sparks in this film with his dreamy-eyed portrayl of Barry, the man smitten by Lucy, who intercuts his childhood home movies with hers and shoots them up on a wall in the middle of the city.  Also strong, is the wonderful performance of John Hannah with his Scottish brogue as the recently jilted and somewhat up-tight date.  My daughter who watched the film was rooting for him to be the one Lucy picks.  His performances in ""4 Weddings & A Funeral,"" ""Sliding Doors,"" and ""The Mummy"" have created an excellent body of work.  Gael Garcia Bernal is certainly an outstanding young hunk; & director Sherman wastes little time before [getting] him down in bed with Lucy.  He's actually very believable as the young serious playwright and has a wonderful apartment with a stream running through it!  (I thought, ""That's my kind of nature; no mosquitoes."")  Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia is delightfully obtuce as the jockish baseball player.  Julie Christie gives a charming cameo as Lucy's mama.  Julianne Nicholson does a great job as the best friend.  The plot is interesting with 5 dates intercut, knowing that she chooses one to marry, and going through each date concurrently to see who walks to the alter with Lucy.  The DVD special features weren't that memorable.  I kept misremembering the title as ""I Love Lucy,"" but this lighthearted sweet film is a great diamond.  Enjoy!",1049673600,13,2184,4.8382749326145555
1830914,2,B0000897EH,Watch out for Gael Garcia..he is an amazing talented actor and heavenly good looking. His cameo is probably the best 5 minutes of this film. Just wait a couple years..Gael will be a super star!!!,1049500800,2,195,4.6
1830915,3,B0000897EH,"and that reason is the presence of Gael Garcia Bernal in one of his rare English-speaking roles.  I'M WITH LUCY is a pleasant enough bit of fluff about a young woman recovering from love lost, trying to cope with five different blind dates arranged by her friends to bouy her spirits. Yes she ends up marrying one of them, but it is the play of courtship dances and dilemmas that brings what little originality to the film that exists.  Monica Potter is attractive and a good actresss who needs a good director to keep her focused: there is a feeling that this role was written with a gene pool of Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts in mind.  The men's roles are fairly well fleshed out by such fine actors as Anthony LaPaglia, Henry Thomas, and John Hannah.
But the real reason to pay attention to this movie is the cameo appearance by Gael Garcia Bernal, one of the brightest lights to hit the screen in years. Known for his Spanish speaking roles in AMORES PERROS, Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and EL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO Bernal has that illuminating presence, naturally sensuous good looks, and a subtlety to his acting that makes his every appearance on the screen a little jewel of a moment.  In a year or two when he is a major international star you will be pleased that you got this glimpse of his special qualities in this English introduction.  Bernal gets 5 stars, the film - 3.",1048809600,4,1380,4.48207171314741
1830916,5,B0000897EH,"This has to be one of the greatest romantic comedy films I have ever seen.
The idea of 5 blind dates and one true love may seem like a cliche and a tired plot, however this film creates and tells the story the way few films do.
To be honest I thought the film was a little slow for the first 15 minutes, but after watching it in its entirety, I found that the first 15 minutes were key in that it brought you into the mood and emotions the characters were feeling.

1830943,2,B0000897EH,"***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*** Something big is missing from this film, something key to what the story is about. The writer and the director skipped something important either by accident (hard to do) or because they couldn't figure out what it was and just wrote over it (more likely). The skipping around from guy to guy and date to date tries to cover up this problem but I felt it; right where it should have happened we are suddenly told it's ""Six Weeks Later"". The key to this film lay in those missing six weeks and I kept waiting for it to be revealed in another way: through some non-linear storytelling. It never is. This leaves us without some key knowledge about the characters and the relationships and so we are simply dragged forward into some rather too simple TV-style ""telling"" scenes - Boreanaz getting angry in a restaurant for instance - that begin wrapping up the conclusion for us. This simplistic and generic rom-com writing deprives us of something that we really need to invest us fully in Lucy's plight. The film relies a great deal on Monica Potter's own peculiar mix of bunny rabbit charm and almost too-cute-to-live good looks. There is something about Ms. Potter which both attracts me and freaks me out simultaneously and I confess that after having seen her in three or four films I still don't know whether I like her or can't stand her. Still, she has this adorability quotient which more or less varnishes over her skills, such as they are, to the point that each emotional quantity - whether she is drunk, sexed up (I almost feel dirty saying that about her), angry, pleased, worried, thrilled, or grieving - is too similar to the next one. Nonetheless, I want her to be happy in the end and in this film I was not sure that she was.",1328832000,,1769,4.60126582278481

You'll quickly know all of the main characters (Lucy, 5 guys and a few of Lucy's friends) because the movie somehow gives them so much life. You'll love or hate them all by the end while having a hundred good laughs in between.

If you're up for a rom com soon, you'd do yourself a huge disservice by not watching this one.",1306108800,,563,4.063063063063063
1830946,5,B0000897EH,"It takes a few scenes to get into I'm with Lucy, with its broad sense of humor meshed with a quieter, more introspective view on dating, but once things gel a bit, it almost never misses a beat.  It's the second film by independent filmmaker Jon Sherman (Breathing Room), working with first-time screenwriter Eric Pomerance's script, but it feels like the work of more seasoned veterans, with a good balance of storytelling and character development that pays off quite well during the film's more romantic moments.  Above and beyond all else, it's really the cast that shines in this one, with solid casting in each respective role, and, of course, Potter sparkles in her first starring role, hopefully the first of many.

So the next time you're in the video store and in the mood for a romantic comedy, take a look for I'm with Lucy, for a colorful and somewhat touching formula flick that will remind you of some of the best of Julia, and not just because of Potter.

She managed to end up with the least attractive, second-most annoying one of her dates, and they had absolutely no chemistry.  In a romance movie, the viewer likes to identify with the characters, and I think this movie didn't do well because no one wanted to end be in Lucy's shoes at the end.  Like some of the other reviewers, I initially decided to watch this movie for a chance to see Gael Garcia Bernal, but it was Anthony LaPaglia's performance and character that charmed me.  What started off as an abysmal date actually turned out pretty well, and Bobby and Lucy had some of the funniest exchanges of the movie, and they had good chemistry.  I wanted to see more of them together.",1132531200,3,766,4.482014388489208
1830956,3,B0000897EH,"If you have seen the thriller `Along Came the Spider,' you must remember Monica Potter as supporting role beside Morgan Freeman. The film itself turns out far from a success, but actually, she is much better, and looks more natural in romantic comedy, and `I'm with Lucy' easily proves that. This lesser-known film is not going to make her famous, I regret, but it is still worth a look for her charms.

The idea is both simple and complex at the same time. Lucy meets five men in a year, and we are told in the first 10 minutes that she is going to marry one of them. They are Doug, Gabriel, Bobby, Barry and Luke, played by John Hannah, Gael Garcia Bernal, Anthony LaPaglia, Henry Thomas, and David Boreanaz respectively. So who is going to be Mr. Right for Lucy? (By the way, there is a man No. 6 Peter played by Craig Bierko who appears briefly in the opening. Could be a dark horse, or not.)

So simple. And complex. `With `I'm with Lucy' writer Eric Pomerance attempts to break the familiar rules of romantic comedy, but despite its interesting idea, I don't think it works. The reason is just this: characters. Five male characters are all stock type, and few of them are round enough to show the depth. Some of the actors are also typecast. John Hannah is Mr. Nice Guy, and Hannah has played similar roles in the past (see `Sliding Doors' for instance) and Gael Garcia Bernal is a sexy guy with Latin background again.

Still it is joyful to watch Monica Potter as Lucy who, in spite of her peculiar propensity for blundering, is likable all through the film. Surprisingly her acting becomes very touching when Lucy shows unexpected subtlety in her character - see when she leaves one of the dates, both knowing that they would never meet again. This sad scene (which reminds me of one brief meeting of Hugh Grant and Emily Mortimer in `Notting Hill') shows the brilliance of the actors, but that is when we are reminded of the fact that we don't need as many as five dates to make one good romantic comedy.

With all good intention, good acting, and very good-natured heroine, the concept of `I'm with Lucy' is too ambitious for romantic comedy, which has strict rule - that is `Boy Meets Girl' & `Girl Meets Boy.' Five boys are good to make one good comedy, but you don't need five boys to write one good romantic story. Still, I love Monica Potter's Lucy, and three stars go to her.",1131926400,4,2393,4.481651376146789

Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well.

I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention.

The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late.

Cute movie, with a good heart. Definetly made a date night at home wonderful.

1830965,4,B0000897EH,"""I'm With Lucy"" is not a great romantic comedy but I swear it is worth watching a lot more than many of the movies in this genre that I have seen in recent years with bigger stars (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maid-in-Manhattan/dp/B0000897EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maid in Manhattan</a>"").  In fact, this 2002 film has exactly what was missing in the last romantic comedy I saw, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chasing-Liberty/dp/B0001US8GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chasing Liberty</a>,"" which was a grand romantic gesture.  The Mandy Moore film sets up the situation for the grand romantic gesture but fails to deliver.  Meanwhile, this film starring Monica Potter not only has a pretty great grand romantic gesture, it actually comes as something of a surprise in the film.

The story first time screenwriter Eric Pomerance has to tell is about Lucy, who is about to get married when we first meet her.  We learn that after being dumped by her boyfriend under circumstances that would send most young women to hide under their covers for at least a year, Lucy is set up with five blind dates over the course of that year by her sister.  One of these five, we are told, will end up marrying Lucy and obviously we are supposed to see if we can figure out who is Mr. Right before our heroine does.

We are introduced to the five blind dates in quick succession, which sets up the logic of the film as we cycle through Lucy's five choices again and again.  First, there is Doug (John Hannah), a recently divorced entomologist.  He is simple and sincere but seems a bit intimidated by the train wreck that is Lucy's life.  Second is the steamy playwright Gabriel (Gael Garca Bernal), who is sexy as all get out and has a stream going through his apartment.  Third is Bobby (Anthony LaPaglia) an ex-Jock who cannot believe that Lucy (a) does not know who he is and (b) refuses his moves.  Fourth is Luke (David Boreanaz WITH A TAN!) a physical therapist who has plenty of other women interested in him if Lucy is not interested.  Finally there is Barry (Henry Thomas), a charming computer nerd.

It takes a while for this movie to really get rolling because the storytelling gimmick gets in the way at the beginning.  All five of the blind dates are introduced as disasters so it is somewhat surprising that any of them get to the level where marriage is a possibility.  But part of the charm of Pomerance's story is that even the guy who makes the worst first impression might actually be a worthwhile human being.  Of course the other possibility, that some of these guys might not really be as great as they seem, comes into play as well.  You may have a favorite early on, but it is hard to really declare any of these guys out of the running, until the grand romantic gestures has you declaring game, set, match (and even then...).

The jumping around does not always work, mainly to the detriment of our getting to really know Lucy herself until the last half of the film, but there are enough cuts that work to the advantage of ""I'm With Lucy"" to make it a worthwhile gimmick on balance.  More importantly, the film has a payoff that exceeds the set up, which is rare enough in contemporary romantic comedies to make it something to cherish.

Final Note: I never really heard of this film before and like many people only stumbled across it because David Boreanaz (WITH A TAN!) is in it.  But I am not surprised that ""I'm With Lucy"" was under the radar because the trailer for this film is one of the worst I have ever seen.  If I had seen the trailer first I would have probably passed on this film, even with the presence of the actor formally known as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel/dp/B000TLTCU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel</a>.

1830969,3,B0000897EH,"I bought this movie on the strength of seeing Gael Garcia Bernal in the cast list. Gael Garcia Bernal, for those not familiar with him, is an amazing (and very sexy) Mexican actor who is in the wonderful film ""Amores Perros."" His strong and really amusing performance in this film was the thing I liked best about this movie, and he is only in a couple of scenes. More screen time with him and John Hannah would have been great as they flit on screen and off too quickly and without much explanation. Monica Potter is lovely and believable. David Boreanaz is funny as an obsessive orthopedist who likes Lucy, but can't seem to keep his eyes (and hands) off other women while thinking some things about Lucy would be better if only changed 'one little bit.' He likes Lucy, but doesn't like her for her. Henry Thomas was a likeable character but seemed too besotted too quickly. At times I felt the chemistry between him and Lucy was manufactured, though they were charming-looking together on screen. The film jumps all over the place and at one point you are whisked from cold, wintry New York to sunny Miami (while the caption on the screen had just said ""January"") without any introduction into why Lucy is there when she just fell into the snow drunk in the previous scene. The film takes on too much too quickly, and at 97 minutes seems too short. It would have been great if 20 minutes or so were to have been added to the film to flesh out some of the relationships and encounters. Anthony La Paglia is too stereotypical of a ""Guido"" type and I found his screen presence annoying. The scene where Lucy runs into her parents while on her first date with Henry Thomas and is forced into going to her parents' apartment to watch home movies of her as a kid makes for a very funny and classic scene. If you like David Boreanaz or Gael Garcia Bernal you will not be disappointed, but note that David Boreanaz's character in ""I'm with Lucy"" is nothing like ""Angel."" I would compare this to ""Serendipity"" or ""The Very Thought of You,"" as this is very similar territory and familiar material. It's funny and entertaining with great moments and decent performances, but left me feeling like it was all appetizer and no entree.",1069459200,7,2223,4.546134663341646
1830970,4,B0000897EH,"I bought this DVD on a lark. I was familiar with Monica Potter and liked her in ""The Very Thought of You"" (another fun romantic comedy starring Joseph Fiennes and Rufus Sewell) but didn't really know much about this movie or heard much about it.  This was actually much better and more enjoyable than I expected.
The premise is pretty clever - Lucy gets dumped by her boyfriend and her best friends set her up on blind dates. Flash forward to the present where we see Lucy getting ready for her wedding.  We know she ends up with someone in the end.  So we see flashbacks as her 5 dates unfold and we get to guess who she ends up with.  On the surface all the dates look pretty hopeless (no chemistry, nothing in common, etc) but as the dates progress we find a couple of guys who may not be so bad after all.  It's a nice romantic comedy with a sweet satisfying ending.
I would also suggest checking out ""The Very Thought of You"" as another movie that is fun and romantic.  It is very much in the tone of movies like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Serendipity.""  If you like these, then check this DVD/video out.",1067040000,7,1117,4.29047619047619

I would have found the movie more fulfilling if the  key characters could have been developed in more depth.  I didn't see near as much as I wanted to of the sensual lover man.  His character was interesting and so was the way she interacted with him and conflicted with herself.  In fact, even the men we saw the most of, could have used more plot, to make the connections more believable and understandable. The movie just jumped from first date - to boyfriend - to move in status in a matter of 2 scenes with the men.  I liked the idea of the movie, but the execution left more to desire.  Even so, I felt the movie was warm and entertaining.  Good company for a lonely movie night.  The soundtrack was very tasteful.  Most were songs I had never heard before, but almost every one caught my ear.  I wish there was a soundtrack to this movie.  I would buy it immediately.",1060128000,,1009,4.331550802139038

7980495,4,B0000897EH,"The cover image would be better suited for the 90s teen flicks, but this is truly one of the best (certainly the most underrated) romantic comedies of the past couple decades. It's more clever than, say, When Harry Met Sally, and certainly more interesting than Pretty Woman. I stumbled across it on TV a couple years after it's release and never really forgot it.

The premise is quite creative in an industry that prefers to play out the same tired tropes with newer faces. Lucy (Monica Potter) endures a particularly humiliating break up in the opening, then proceeds through a series of five blind dates. Rather than portray this chronologically, the film advances through the dates in brief cuts lasting a couple minutes each before moving on to the next,  then cycling through them again. Apparently this confuses or displeases some viewers, but I thought it maintained a sharp pace for the film.

The acting is pretty outstanding. Potter plays the neurotic, opinionated feminist journo to the hilt, playing off her co-stars quite skillfully. The humor is subtle but biting and equally takes shots at Lucy's own hypocrisies and her date's idiosyncrasies. I found all the primary characters but one to be likable even if not particularly attractive to me personally.

SPOILERS**

There were a few things that bothered me about the film. First, the sense of timing is warped- someone mentioned the amount of activity packed into all the dates, which is true. For instance, her first date with Doug ended with him taking her home at 1AM. Although we don't know what time they went out initially, they managed to go to dinner, collect food from the outdoor stand, rob the all-night grocer, then end up at the chess table (bar?). Since the movement made the movie all the more interesting, it wasn't a concern. There was also the point in which Lucy left Barry at her parent's, he apparently searched TEN stores, then found her stumbling around the streets. How long was she walking for? I'm just nit-picky about these things, and again not a huge problem. However the timeline in which she began dating Barry and his ""proposal"" (more on that below) in seven WEEKS was ...highly unrealistic.

 I wasn't surprised that Lucy ended up with Barry- he was truly the best choice and a great character. I did find his actions slightly creepy, in a couple different ways. First that he went through such a extensive search for her medication of choice. It was an extremely sweet gesture, yet they'd only JUST met that day. And quite frankly, Lucy was kind of rude to him from jump. It was surprising, at least, that he would go through all the trouble after she walked out on him at her own parent's home. But they shared similar personalities so I guess I can somewhat excuse it. However- the jump from meeting to shoving a ring on her finger after six or seven weeks was frankly disturbing; if I were in her position I'd be extremely concerned and cautious about why someone I hardly know (because how can you at that point) is so gung-ho to impress me and ""tie me down."" And they manner in which he did it- not asking, just pushing the ring on and not really inquiring her opinion at all. Then again, he could just be a guy who knows what he wants, (and perhaps knew better about how right they were for each other earlier than Lucy did), and good for him.

Again, Barry was all-around the best man for Lucy. The spliced home-movies show he created and played for Lucy was truly beautiful. I'm surprised Lucy didn't dump Luke right then and there- the guy was a complete pig. Pro-tip: if you're already feeling extreme pangs of jealousy on your first date with a guy, not a great choice. I thought the dates with Barry and Bobbie were by far the best; Bobbie was hilarious. Not someone I'd choose, but not a bad person. The date with Gabriel had it's moments- what woman wouldn't end up in that (ahem) position. And the little exchange about his Julius Cesar play was top-notch. I just felt smothered watching the rest of their date, so I could relate to Lucy's feelings about that.

Overall the film is witty and engaging, so I'm surprised it went below the mainstream radar. Someone else commented that release was hampered by a change in execs which explains things somewhat. Truly a shame because it's so rare a romantic comedy film takes a fresh approach and is still so well-written and acted. The moments that appear disjointed, weird or confusing to other reviewers- well, they're intended. For instance, the initial break up scene is excruciatingly awkward in such a way it creates tension in the viewer, and causes them to feel uncomfortable as Lucy- that's just good film-making. Lucy mentions outright she is kind of a weird person- the various ways each of her dates react to her eccentricities (and vice versa) is, well, kind of the point of the film.

This is getting quite long, but this is one the absolute best romantic comedies for both men and women which is another feature unique for the genre. The portrayal of the men is actually respectful and honest- Doug is a upstanding guy, all the way around. Gabriel likes getting physical. Bobbie has a rather antiquated view on the roles of men and women, but still has an underlying sensitivity and kindness. Barry is a successful entrepreneur, assertive but loving. Only Luke was a controlling jerk, but he rightfully got rejected. Lucy's portrayal was compassionate and honest yet far from a perfect ""MarySue"" type that we see too often in this genre; she was flawed, but willing make things right with the man she loved but left, out of fear. It's a nice twist, versus films where it's typically the man groveling back to the woman (because it's more romantic I guess) even though both parties are equally at fault.",1507334400,,5781,4.70919881305638
