Check out the latest Bobby J. Copeland book on ""Bill Elliott:The Peaceable Man"" is chuck full of answers to all the questions his fans had from early on...plenty of thrills, adventure and loaded with action. My personal favorites were the ""Red Ryder Series"" or ""The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok"" an ongoing character that would appear in many films to come...as Hickok and Wild Bill Saunders. Elliott was a natural for the western, his riding abilities and fight scenes were the caliber of Buck Jones, Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele...good reading for all you wranglers out there...I found myself being transported back in time, Mr. Copeland's book has opened my eyes to what a wonderful unselfish person Bill Elliott was...only wish I could have met him. He was one of a kind...a peaceable man!...published by Empire Publising and available on Amazon and Empire Publications Inc.

 Red Ryder was a popular American fictional cowboy created by Stephen Slesinger and drawn by artist Fred Harman ... the artist had created the Western adventure comic strip Bronc Peeler in 1933, and the central character, Bronc Peeler, evolved over five years, eventually getting a name change to Red Ryder ... beginning Sunday, November 6. 1938, Red Ryder was syndicated by NEA, expanding over the following decade to 750 newspapers with a readership of 14 million ... endless parade of comic books, Big Little Books, novels, serial chapters, radio programs and products ... astride his mighty steed Thunder, Red was a tough cowpoke who lived in Painted Valley with his aunt, the Duchess, and his sidekick, Buckskin Blodgett. Little Beaver rode his horse, Papoose, when they took off to deal with the bad guys ... and VCI Home Video has released all of this on the wonderful Red Ryder B-Western Series ... gotta love it.
