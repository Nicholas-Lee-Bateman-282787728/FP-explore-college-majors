2663378,4,B000IU37WA,"Beth Chollete & other reviewers already wrote great reviews so I am only going to add a few things.
The production quality like her Level 1 is amazing, on par with a blockbuster movie. Her backup dancers are beautifully poised.
The sitting, standing energy exercises & 5 Tibetans are more expanded then her Level 1 & I did actually feel my energy increase unlike her Level 1.
In the 5 Tibetans, she actually referred this workout to be Level 4.
If you enjoy it, check out Discovering Chi or Tantric Toning for a less watered down workout type of Qi Gong exercises that will really make you feel your energy until you hummm with it. Simply Spoga & Spoga also does the 5 Tibetans in 20 min, but it's a bit more drawn out.
Jennifer seems to have her finger on what the mainstream consumer is ready for & hence this great dvds, though this style has been around though not many people were interested in the mind/body connection as much back then.
She gives great details, analogies & even best, the benefits of the exercises, though I agree, many parts of telling you how to do the exercises would be best as part of the intro or beginning instead of stop/starting each time & also not so much digressing/talking.
While Jennifer is very knowledgeable, has great body awareness, gives great clues, I think it's not that she talks too much, but her voice is more berating then explaining/calm. This might stress one out, and turn many off.

2663379,4,B000IU37WA,"This is a new video by Jennifer Kries, a ballet-trained fitness instructor who is well-known for her The Method Pilates videos. Here, Jennifer expands her teaching and adds a new element, the concept of Yin (cool, relaxing) and Yang (hot, energy).  Thus the concept of this DVD is to provide exercise segments which are designed mainly to relax, energize, or both. There are a total of 7 different individual workouts, each of which are designated as Yin or Yang; 3 of these segments involve use of ""Pilates Toys,"" including a magic circle, dumbbells, and a stability ball.  The DVD offers a variety of workout options, including 7 ""custom"" premixed routines which combine two or more of the individual segments.

Here is the main menu for the DVD:

*Welcome to Hot Body Cool Mind

*Complete Waking Energy Life Force Workout

*Waking Energy Workout Segments

*7 Custom Waking Energy Workout Combinations

*The Yin Yoga and Meridian Theory Interview

*Credits

*About Jennifer

I didn't try any of the premixed workout combinations, as most were a bit too lengthy for me (3 of the 7 were under 50 minutes, the remainder were 52 minutes and more, up to 87 minutes).  However, I did mix and match until I had used each one of the 7 individual workouts.  When you select the option for the individual segments from the main DVD menu above, the breakdown is as follows below (note: the times are all as given on the DVD insert, and the 5 segments labeled ""on the go"" are less than 25 minutes each):

*Waking Energy Introduction

*Waking Energy ""Before You Begin""

*Waking Energy Sitting (21 min.) -on the go

*Waking Energy Standing (24 min.)

*The 5 Tibetans Introduction

*The 5 Tibetans (11 min.) -on the go

*Pilates Magic Circle (14 min.) -on the go

*Pilates Sculpting Series (10 min.) -on the go

*PhysioBall (10 min.) -on the go

*Yin Yoga Introduction

*Yin Yoga and Meditation, Full Yin (28 min.)

*Yin Yoga and Meditation, Shorter Practice (21 min.)

Okay, now I will provide my impressions of each of the above:

Waking Energy Sitting (actual time 28.5 minutes).  Jennifer states that this is the ""full list"" of waking energy exercises (as opposed to the shorter series on the Level 1 DVD).  The moves here are based largely on Chi-Gong and focus on awakening chi, or life-force; the exercises involve activities such as rubbing the hands together to generate energy and actually slapping and punching the body to loosen trapped chi (Jennifer provides detailed instruction on these moves both during the workout itself and in the accompanying booklet to insure that they are pleasant). Self-massage movements are also included, from loosening the muscles of the entire face by massaging the eyes, cheeks, jaw, and ears to massaging the feet.  Overall, I think this segment would work great for a warm-up, although it is a bit lengthy to use regularly for that purpose.

Waking Energy Standing.  This segment is also based on Chi-Gong as well as Makko-Ho (active meridian stretch).  Performed standing and including various spinal rolls, I found it to be more energizing and stretching than the seated version (although both Waking Energy segments are supposed to serve dual Yin or Yang roles depending on when they are performed).  Although not labeled this way on the menu, it is actually shorter than the seated segment.

The 5 Tibetans. These 5 exercises are known as the ""Rites of Rejuvenation;"" they are practiced by Tibetan Monks and are supposed to stimulate the chakra system to provide age-defying benefits. Some of the moves are recognizable from yoga, such as camel pose and down dog, but all are performed in a series of flowing repetitions (the goal is 21 for each exercise) with breath. Assuming that you've already worked with her previous DVDs, Jennifer does 14 reps of each move here (she starts with only 7 reps on the Level 1 DVD).  Despite my prior experience with both yoga and the 5 Tibetans themselves, I found it a bit difficult to keep up with Jennifer's fast pace, although she does instruct you to relax with two full breaths between each exercise set.  She also shows some modifications for each movement prior to starting the exercise, but I thought this disrupted the flow of the workout, especially when she could have included this information in the 5 Tibetans introductory segment.  This workout ends with the goddess breath.

Pilates Magic Circle.  This was a nice short workout using the Pilates circle or ring.  It begins working the upper and the lower body from a standing position, using some unique variations on the exercises that I haven't seen in other ring workouts.  There is also some work for the abs from a seated position as well as additional moves performed on one side only.

Pilates Sculpting Series.  Here Jennifer leads her two background exercisers through the standard standing arms series developed by Joseph Pilates.  She moves briskly from exercise to exercise, sometimes pausing before a new movement to give a form demonstration.  Jennifer notes that 5-10 repetitions are the usual recommendation, and she does 8 of each exercise here (although the reps were slightly off on a few occasions).

PhysioBall.  This third short ""Pilates Toys"" segment was more challenging than I had expected!  Jennifer begins seated on the stability ball for abs crunches, moves to feet resting on the ball for hamstring work, and finishes with some tough plank work on the ball (she briefly demonstrates even more advanced variations).

Yin Yoga and Meditation, Full Yin.  Jennifer describes Yin Yoga as ""needle-less acupuncture"" in the sense that it targets the meridian areas of the body to provide complete relaxation (she explains this further in the interview link off the main menu).  Jennifer alternately refers to the postures as ""makko-hos"" and explains which meridian pairs are addressed by each.  Although she recommends holding the poses for up to 15 minutes or at least 8-10 breaths, they are NOT held that long here; rather, she frequently reminds the viewer that she and her helpers are offering an overview of how you would practice on your own.  The postures are performed entirely on the floor and include butterfly (cobbler's pose), a choice of seal (similar to cobra) or saddle (similar to 1-leg reclined hero), seated forward bend, dragon (wide-legged seated forward bend), a choice of shoelace (bull seat or the legs from cow-face pose) or eye of the needle (thread the needle) or ankle to knee (double pigeon), pigeon, wide-legged child's pose (Jennifer actually recommends performing regular child's pose between every posture, but this is not shown), dragonfly (wide-legged forward bend), quarter dog, reclined twist (revolved stomach pose), dead bug, cross-legged seated forward bend with crossed arms, and relaxation/final meditation.

Yin Yoga and Meditation, Shorter Practice.  This abbreviated Yin Yoga practice (21 minutes) is not listed on the DVD insert.  It contains the same footage as the Full Yin practice above, but a few of the postures are left out, and others don't seem to be held quite as long (the end of the practice in particular felt a bit more rushed).  Poses here include butterfly, choice of seal or saddle, seated forward bend, choice of shoelace or eye of the needle or ankle to knee, pigeon, dragonfly, reclined twist, and relaxation/final meditation.

In summary, this is generally a very well-done DVD with a variety of practice options. I think that ideally, it would appeal to someone with prior experience in both Pilates and yoga who is interested in incorporating additional Eastern principles and philosophies into their workouts.  I can see myself using the waking energy segments whenever I want to feel gently refreshed, the Pilates segments as add-ons to my other workouts, and the Yin Yoga practices when I want to get the benefits of relaxing yoga postures with extended holds.  My overall rating is about 4 1/2 of 5 stars.

One final note:  Hot Body Cool Mind ""Waking Energy"" was released at the same time as another Hot Body Cool Mind DVD by Jennifer Kries, Level 1 (or ""Embark on the Journey"").  Apparently, two other DVDs in this series, Level 2, ""Harness the Power,"" and Level 3, ""The Life Force Power Workout"" are yet to be released.  Also, during her instruction for this Waking Energy video, Jennifer sometimes refers to it as Level 4 and assumes your prior experience with the other DVDs in this series.",1170374400,16,8430,4.971448965024982
2663380,5,B000IU37WA,"Jennifer is a good instructor and she's very soothing. She explained in details of each movement and type of workouts. This DVD has variety of workouts and you'll need a mat, a chair, a set of dumbbells, a physio ball, Pilates magic circle, and a towel. You can do some workouts without those props.  I like this DVD because this is more like an all-in-one reference workout DVD than regular workout DVDs. I can choose a workout that fits my available time. She has 2-3 other people so you can see modification. My favorite is Pilates Magic Circle workout, about 15 min long. Just fit my schedule in the morning. If I have more time, I repeat more reps. Yoga stretch/meditation is very good after a long day of works. I haven't tried physio ball workout though. I have small space to workout at home and there are no shoes required for these workouts. All are easy to follow and music is good too.

These are the workouts:
Waking energy with chair: 28min, standing 24m, 5 Tibetans with mat: 10m, Pilates magic circle: 15m, Pilates Sculpting with weights: 9m, Ball: 10m, Yoga meditation full: 30m, short: 20m.

I'm sort of lazy to exercise (short of time and space) but have to workout and am trying. I really need motivation and this one fits my needs. Oh, I also like the cover, Jennifer and her man but he's not in the workouts :( '. Just another guy, not that hot like the man from the cover.

PS. Another good all-in-one workout DVD is ""Pilates Complete Sculpt & Tone."" It also has Pilates Magic Workout too. It's a good idea to have that Pilates circle, just squeeze between legs for inner legs or pressing/pulling with hands for arms while watching movies or TV, especially during commercials. Don't worry; you can do those on the couch.",1167955200,8,1743,4.559105431309904

8147455,1,B000IU37WA,"Was disappointed in the DVD.  I just wanted to pop it into my computer, go to a specific workout and get started.  But the disc has a long intro and then it is difficult to find the workout you want.",1398902400,,199,3.95
8147456,4,B000IU37WA,I like this dvd a lot but you have to keep stopping it and starting it if you want to get the full benefit.,1389916800,,107,3.5
8147457,5,B000IU37WA,"I love this exercise dvd. It is unlike my usual work out routine, and I practice it when I need a more relaxing, centered experience. It was the perfect addition to my exercise dvd library. Great job once again!",1333929600,,211,4.435897435897436
8147458,5,B000IU37WA,"I found this in the library and loved it immediately. I was so happy to be able to purchase this on Amazon. This is a unique dvd and it works by mastering energy or Life Force energy called qi. I love yoga but also practive Qi Gong Some of you may be new to this but she introduces this concept in her instruction so you may want to get a little more information on it. She does have other great practices that include pilates adn many other forms so a great dvd.

However, if you have never experienced this this Life force energy before you will definately feel it in this video. You immediately begin to feel hot as the energy flows. Soem may even feel your hands pulsating.

This really wakes up that energy within so it flows through all your chakras. I also recommend Qi Gong DVd [....]",1314576000,,792,4.273333333333333
8147459,4,B000IU37WA,"This is a very well produced video with a varied workout selection so that it does not become boring.

You will be pleasantly suprised with the toning you start to notice from Jennifer's workouts and the peace of mind I love doing a segment before work and the yin segment in the evening I love it so much I bring it away with me and have given this dvd to some of my ruuning friends to help with flexibility.",1207526400,,618,4.073770491803279
8147461,5,B000IU37WA,"I am DAZZLED by WAKING ENERGY! (Jennifer's magical combination of ancient age-defying, heating and cooling work-outs) and you will be too!
Let me begin by saying that JENNIFER KRIES is always ahead of the curve and all of her DVD's are must-haves (I confess, I own every one of them).  But I believe that WAKING ENERGY is in a class by itself.  From the moment I insert the disc into the player, I feel like I did when I was a child after a long day at school - - I can't wait to PLAY!  (And I am never disappointed.)

I begin by rubbing my palms together (the Energy Wash) and generating a little chi (my Life Force).  In a blink I am all focus and into my practice.  I actually feel energy awakening as Jennifer, with spot-on metaphors and breathing cues, takes me on a journey of incredible self-massage - -from the crown of my head, to my eyes and ears, to the back of my neck, all the way down to my toes, to my feet, the back of my calves, my thighs, my butt, OH, BABY!  We're AWAKE and ALIVE!

Then guided by her skilled and eloquent coaching, deeper into my practice I go, breathing and melting into my innermost self until I am lost to an energetic haze: the energy of the Universe!  I am energizing every part of my body.  I am reaching out to the heart of the world.  (Hey, I'm an ordinary person!!!  and if you don't believe what I am saying, please click on the shopping cart and buy Jennifer's WAKING ENERGY, YIN YOGA, or any other of her HOT BODY COOL MIND DVD's and see for yourself!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jennifer-Kries-Hot-Body-Cool-Mind-Waking-Energy/dp/B000IU37WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jennifer Kries: Hot Body Cool Mind - Waking Energy</a>

It doesn't end there!  I feel an unbelievable buzz - - I am revved up and totally energized for hours after each practice (I am not exaggerating) and even more extraordinary, I feel decompressed, grounded and calm at the same time.  If this is what Jennifer Kries means when she says that I am activating the chakras or opening the energy vortexes and pathways of my body, I'll be a Tibetan monk!  I hereby sign on.

Sometimes I choose one of her 7 signature work-out combinations (my favorite is ""THE PERFECT BALANCE,"" a duo of WAKING ENERGY and YIN YOGA (yang/hot and yin/cool), or if I am pressed for time, one of the intense 10 minute time-savers.  (I love the Five Tibetans because it is a 5000 year old workout that is positively HOT!  Ten minutes of this rigorous, cumulatively challenging total body energy work (the closely guarded secret of Tibetan monks) will keep you FOREVER YOUNG! ) (It's intense)  But when my body is calling for Yang Rising Heat (for a quick energy fix)  or the calming solitude and meditativeness of a YIN practice, it's easy.  A little of this, a little of that.  I click and customize.  Jennifer's ultimate work-out is the full rhythmic and powerful (90 minute) WAKING ENERGY FLOW (truly the equivalent of going to a spa without leaving home).  Invite a friend, as I have.  WAKING ENERGY together is simply poetic.

Many people still think of fitness as toning and sculpting and creating a beautiful body.  But the ancients knew that a beautiful body was merely a reflection of the health and vitality of the breathing, flowing, circulating body within.  Ultimately, there's you (the body you see when you look in the mirror) and there's your ENERGY BODY!  so WAKE IT UP! REPLENISH! SPEND IT! BEGIN AGAIN!  Got that? (WAKING ENERGY makes all the sense in the world, doesn't it?  You want to feel FOREVER YOUNG, right?)

I count myself among the very fortunate to have a fitness guru in my life like JENNIFER KRIES.  Perhaps, like me, you are lucky enough to have visited the Philadelphia area and along with several very special ladies, instead of lunch, taken a 12 noon WAKING ENERGY/YIN YOGA class at Jennifer's studio!  (a little surreal to be in her presence!  I admire her so much!)  You'd have heard her share in person, as we were cupping our hands and freeing up a lot of stagnant energy, many of the wise things she says on her DVD - -that all we do is pound our bodies (and ourselves) with exercise when what we need in our stress-filled lives is some subtle, profound bodywork.  After class, reluctant to leave, every person raved about how incredibly energized and de-stressed they felt!  So, my recommendation once again is to click on the shopping cart, buy Jennifer's WAKING ENERGY DVD and begin to WAKE IT ALL UP!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jennifer-Kries-Hot-Body-br-Cool-Mind-Waking-Energy/dp/B000IU37WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jennifer Kries: Hot Body

And, #2: WAKING ENERGY - -this ancient organic fitness that Jennifer has created, with its incredible ability to throw open the windows and doors of our bodies and minds - - WAKING ENERGY will leap into today's lexicon of fitness and become a household word!  (and as Jennifer herself would say, ""The fountain of boundless energy awaits you. . . radiant, stress-free and FOREVER YOUNG!)

Not just an afterthought: The WAKING ENERGY DVD is so beautifully costumed and choreographed and so exquisitely filmed, it may as well be a feature film!  The workouts, beautifully demonstrated, are straightforward,  simple to learn and appropriate for all ages (I'm 56!) and levels of ability (beginner to advanced).
