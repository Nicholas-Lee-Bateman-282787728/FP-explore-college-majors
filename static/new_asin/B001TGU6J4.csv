3789334,5,B001TGU6J4,I am a long time collector of Bald Eagle pictures and statues and when I saw this video being offered in Blu-ray I just had to have it.  I might add that I was not disappointed when I got it.  It is a brilliant video showing the life and unfortuneately the death of this mighty bird.  It is easy to see just why our country chose this mighty bird as our national symbol.  I highly recommend this video to anyone who loves the Bald Eagle as much as I do.,1263081600,12,453,4.0

3789347,5,B001TGU6J4,The nature series is a wonderful series from PBS. I love birds and have learned a lot about our indigenous species the American Bald Eagle through the Decorah Eagles web site and have learned a lot more through these informative educational DVD's. Thank you,1393632000,,257,4.863636363636363
3789348,5,B001TGU6J4,Great documentary. One thing I worry about with some of the nature shows is that at times they can get gruesome. I know nature can be brutal but I don't feel a need to watch it on television at night while I'm trying to relax. This was more my pace.,1390867200,,249,4.0
3789349,2,B001TGU6J4,While telling the story of a certain couple of eagles was disapointed by the lack of information on the eagles them selves only focused on these eagles not on the breed itself.,1390003200,,176,4.53125

3789351,5,B001TGU6J4,"American Bald Eagle is a close-up view of the eagle, that was once on the brink of extinction. The film has vivid colors and peaceful music. This documentary covers the successful reintroduction of the eagle, and it concentrates on the nesting, and successful rearing of Bald Eagles bringing up Bald Eagle chicks. Its amazing to see how accurate a Bald Eagle can catch fish in the water without breaking their stride as they swooped down. It also covers the story of the indiscriminate slaughter of Bald Eagles because of ignorance.

It also mentions the use of DDT, and how it took a toll on the eagle population until the pesticide was banded. They covered a certain eagle pair that had two eagle chicks; one chick was female and was older by 4 days. The other chick was male and was being beaten up, and was so weakened and very close to death. The weakened baby eagle made a dramatic recovery; it gained in body size and strength, and ended up strong enough to leave the nest before the bullying chick finally took to the air. I enjoyed this documentary, more than I thought I would, and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in birds of prey.",1364083200,5,1156,4.584541062801932
3789362,5,B001TGU6J4,The film gave enough information and footage on this Eagle as I would have liked. Great dvd for the avid bird-lover and for the average interested person.,1359590400,,154,4.7407407407407405
3789363,5,B001TGU6J4,It is exactly what I expected! A documentary about eagles. Made a great gift for my Father who loves eagles.,1356480000,,108,4.45
3789364,2,B001TGU6J4,"Right on the blu-ray menu, the footage of eagles it was playing was sped up.  I thought to myself, ""That's weird.. why on earth would they speed up this footage?  Oh well whatever,"" then clicked play.  I was horrified to find most of the footage in the actual show was sped up.

This made me completely regret buying this product.

The only reason I am not giving this 1 star is because the information about eagles was excellent.
In fact it kept me watching til the end, despite the distracting unnatural looking sped-up video which ruined the entire thing.

3789366,4,B001TGU6J4,"The video was excellent, however, the vendor was not so good.  I've sent a review of this already,
but who knows where it ends up in outerspace.  The video case arrived damaged and upon
contacting the vendor, by e-mail, there was no replacement.  What you get is what you get.
It was a gift so had to give a damaged product.  Very disappointed.  Will not order from
them again.",1331510400,,377,4.405797101449275
3789367,5,B001TGU6J4,"A Good Eagle Documentary With A Great Bonus Thrown In

American Eagle Review

The storytelling was good. The story mostly focused on a few nesting pairs. However, good efforts were put into telling the story of a typical year in the life of this great species from all across its wide range. This told the broad story and also brought it closer to home by showing the struggles an eagle family faces each year.
The variety of camera shots and the creative ways the cameramen acquired them were very good, particularly the shots from cameras posted near the nests. There were many shots that were made at too great a distance in near-dark conditions that were very grainy and perhaps should have been scrapped or attempted again. The jarring jumps from pretty picture to grainy were distracting and cost this half a star
The sound was very good and was mostly natural. It would have been astonishing to see how they got some of the sound clips given the distances from some of the scenes they shot. With all the scenes of flying eagles perhaps more background music would have added something to it.
The encoding job was mostly flawless. Some scenes were grainy, as above mentioned, because of the way the shots were taken. The only real problems that I felt were encoding caused were in some scenes where the edges of the screen flickered a little bit and I believe this also may have had something to do with the source material. Perhaps the encoding software was simply confused about something in the picture.
I really enjoyed this documentary. It did a good job of summing up the evolving story of Bald Eagles from becoming our enduring national symbol, becoming endangered and finally to getting more of the respect they deserve.

The Story Of Ernest Thompson Seton vs. Lobo Review

The camera work in this documentary was very good. I particularly liked the landscape shots of New Mexico where the story took place and the work with the wolf actors who portrayed Lobo and clan. This really brought the story to life.
The narration and interviews with modern day wolf experts coupled with quotes from Seton himself really combined with the camera work to tell the story in a masterful way. This is the story of how a bounty hunter was hired to pursue the most difficult outlaw he would ever face. One could really see the evolution of Seton and Lobo, his witty wolf adversary, as they trod down the path to the final showdown that must surely come at the end of all Old West tales. Well done indeed.
The ambient sound, the interviews and the acted out quotes from Seton were good. The sounds of the wolf actor portraying Lobo were very nice and authentic to say the least. Along with acted out quotes from Seton the sound made this feel like the life and death struggle it was. Setons career as a bounty hunter was on the line while Lobo and his clans lives were at stake.
I had no problems with the quality of the encoding whatsoever. Everything looked fine throughout the entire documentary.
This felt like a western. I love westerns- especially the memorable ones and how can a showdown between a wolf outlaw and a bounty hunter not grab and hold your attention?

Conclusion

Both of the documentaries in this set are very good. They are both very educational and entertaining with good to excellent video quality packaged with good narration. My only serious complaint is about the few grainy scenes in the American Eagle documentary where it appeared shots were taken in too low of tight or at too far a range. However, for the low price Amazon is offering this set at, there is no reason not to order one for your family.",1325462400,,3632,4.631987577639752
3789368,5,B001TGU6J4,"Being a raptor fanatic and a lover of Bald Eagles in particular, I highly recommend this DVD! It mainly features the eagles of Decorah, Iowa. I got quite excited about this when I discovered it as I am a regular viewer of the live nest webcam in Decorah! There is so much to see and learn in this DVD. Amazing footage of these majestic and powerful birds and so emotionally stirring. Without a doubt this is the best documentary I have ever seen about eagles. Also, it is playable in Australia which is good, as it is not always easy to find DVDs online that are suitable for this region.",1324598400,9,588,4.3545454545454545
3789369,5,B001TGU6J4,"Truly remarkable video.  I have an Eagle's nest visible from my home and I watch it year after year.  I know have even most repsect for the life of these American birds for all that they represent.  The footage and narrative are outstanding and it is a blessing we, the public, are able to enjoy such a powerful documentary. Child or adult, a must see commanding the respect toward this bird that it deserves.",1318032000,,409,4.5
3789370,5,B001TGU6J4,"The documentary 'American Eagle' on DVD from the 'Nature' Series can be recommended throughout. Astonishing shots, closeups combined with a dramatic story.

3789371,5,B001TGU6J4,"I am shocked and angered that, as of this writing, none of the info above credits NEIL RETTIG, who patiently  made these marvelous images, sitting motionless in trees and in blinds, whether one of our subzero blizzards was driving ice needles into his flesh, or our humid summers trickled itchy sweat down his face and neck as clouds of mosquitoes and myriads of crawling insects and other vermin assaulted and tormented him.  I talked with Neil and an associate on a few occasions when our favorite local camera store was still open.  Neil, while being totally dedicated to sharing his unique gifts that combine science, art, and technology, is soft-spoken and hardly a seeker of the spotlight, so I hope he will forgive me for making it clear that NEIL RETTIG is the person who achieved almost all the brilliantly successful work of photographing and producing ""American Eagle.""  F. Murray Abraham, whose name is splattered all over this product and festoons the Amazon info above, is just an actor with a decent voice who does a good job of reading what someone else wrote.  Another reviewer mentioned that he, like Neil and me, is fortunate to know the spectacular Wisconsin / Minnesota upper Mississippi gorge and its tributary coulees where Neil photographed ""American Eagle"" amid the bluff ledges and treetops.

I endured enough discomforts of nature photography to know that I could never have the patience, toughness, and tremendous abilities to be as good as Neil is.  He refuses to quit until he has told the story with footage that presents the subject clearly, but in a natural-appearing fashion without anything that appears contrived or distractingly technological.  I'm also a bit old to clamber up trees and bluffs with many pounds of equipment, so I hope Neil can go on doing it for all of us for a long time.

Thanks, Neil; you're the best there is at what you do.

UPDATE: The info supplied for the DVD version does mention Neil, so why not also the Blu-ray edition?

UPDATE (10 March 2012): I have notified Amazon of Neil Rettig's role in producing this item. I supplied links to the Amazon description of the DVD version and to the ""shop PBS"" site, which says, ""American Eagle was filmed in HD precision by award-winning film maker Neil Rettig capturing little-known behavior of the majestic bird.""

UPDATE (18 March 2012): Neil Rettig now is credited above as Director, but did a great deal more.  Amazon should mention him as prominently as the ""shop PBS"" site does.",1290384000,13,2490,4.84433962264151
