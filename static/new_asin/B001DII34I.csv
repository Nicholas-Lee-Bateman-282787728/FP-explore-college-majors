8293547,4,B001DII34I,"I highly recommend this boxed set and, in particular, this very funny movie. I actually found it interesting to watch both Love is News and That Wonderful Urge consecutively. Each has its own charm but surprised to say that I thought Powers and Tierney slightly better together. This set is a steal for the price.",1520553600,,313,4.709090909090909

8293555,4,B001DII34I,"Since the other reviewer focused on ""That Wonderful Urge"" I will simple state that I agree with most the assesment that it is a good romantic comedy and Power & Tierney have great chemistry in the film.  When viewing the two films you can see how much better Power is with comedy at the later time when the film was made.  ""Love is News"" is one of the many pairings of Power with Young and perhaps one of the weakest of them all.  If you get the Tyrone Power collection that includes this two disk set, you will be exposed to better pairings of Power & Young and while the story of both films here cover the same ground, the later film is much more entertaining.  It also benefits from the lack of a loud and obnoxious performance by Don Ameche.  Love is News is ***, The Wonderful Urge ****, but buy the full Tyrone Power box set which is a better price, contains both films, and is ***** for its' content.",1346457600,,907,4.25
8293556,5,B001DII34I,"This wonderful, romantic comedy has lots of witty dialogue,and subtle innuendo that make it very enjoyable to watch. A slick, quick-paced production, it features performances by the great romantic team of Tyrone Powers and Gene Tierney. When they get together, sparks fly.

Tyrone Powers plays Thomas Jefferson Tyler (Tom Tom), a conniving gossip columnist/reporter who gains Sara Farley's confidence only to betray it. Gene Tierney plays Sara, a rich heiress subject to much gossip; because she has hitherto refused to marry. Sara takes her revenge on Tyler by making the world believe that they were married in secret to discredit and humiliate him in public. Tyler must set the record straight, so he can marry his real fiance. Sarah hoists Tyler with his own petard by leaking the news to the press, using Tyler's own industry rivals as a vehicle of attack. Afterwards, the two constantly turn the tables on one another; and the press, all too anxious for another scandal, dubs Tyler ""the Cinderella Man.""

The plot continues to take many twists and turns as Thomas and Sara out-maneuver each other. All of this is handled in a very delightfully, funny way. Powers and Tierney are at their best. Gene Tierney fans will be excited to hear a sample of her singing voice; a subject of later dispute in the American version of Night and the City (1950). In this movie, anyway, it really sounds like her.

The film flows over a few bumpy cuts and obvious voice-overs effortlessly. Unfortunately, the viewer is subjected to an occasional comment about the marriage relationship that might strike a sour note; however, they pass by quickly and smoothly. After all, it is 1948.",1220400000,10,1673,4.94661921708185
