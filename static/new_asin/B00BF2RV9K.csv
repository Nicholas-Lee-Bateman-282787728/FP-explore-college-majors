5613252,5,B00BF2RV9K,"Get this DVD if you want to watch the best live band in the world today kick some serious butt. If you like the songs you hear on the radio by the Avett Bros, this concert will blow you away! Highly recommended!",1295222400,3,211,4.0476190476190474
5613253,5,B00BF2RV9K,"Damn, so good.
This DVD captures the brothers and their band playing to a Hometown crowd and knocking their socks off. We bought a dozen of these as Christmas gifts for our family this year. After seeing them live in Bayfield, Wis and Deer Valley, Utah last year all I can say is GO SEE THEM LIVE.......... If that is not possible buy this DVD.",1294531200,4,344,4.3076923076923075
5613254,5,B00BF2RV9K,"I haven't been lucky enough to catch these guys live yet, but this live DVD is amazing.  There CD's do a great job of conveying the passion they have for their music, but seeing them live on this DVD you can really feel it.  The show is rowdy, chaotic and amazingly good.  Their voices really do shine through just as much as they do on the studio recordings, if not more.  I picked this up, along with the live MP3 album, and I am definitely not disappointed.",1288396800,2,460,4.252873563218391
5613255,5,B00BF2RV9K,"The Avetts' raw emotion bleeds through their cd's beautifully, however, it's not until one has had the joy of a live show can the Avett Brothers be truly appreciated. This DVD, recorded minutes from their home, is a glowing example of why this group is exploding in popularity. Their enthusiasm for the music and the fans never wanes for a moment. They're not simply paying lip service to the fans either. We've seen them spend hours signing and shaking hands until the last fan knows just how much they are appreciated. This live album is well worth the pickup. I promise, you won't be disappointed.",1287360000,2,600,4.723809523809524
5613256,5,B00BF2RV9K,I have a ton of their live recordings but it is truly special to see them frolick on stage,1286323200,,90,3.789473684210526
5613257,5,B00BF2RV9K,"These guys just keep getting better.  I attended this show and many many more of theirs, and this is something not to be missed.  If you haven't been to a live show, or heard these amazing musicians, you are missing out.  Their incredible energy, profound lyrics, and everything they stand for will keep you coming back from more.  I am proud to live in NC and be around when these guys come home to perform.  Buy this CD and DVD, and I promise you will be a fan for life!",1286236800,4,472,4.2
5613258,5,B00BF2RV9K,"Finally a live DVD from The Avett Brothers! Their shows are unmatched for their energy and intensity, and the music is absolutely amazing. They sound great, and they are a lot of fun to watch. Their best qualities are well represented here. It is, however, a bit short at 74 minutes. I would have loved the inclusion of Pretty Girl from Chile, Left on Laura Left on Lisa plus few other personal favorites.",1286150400,7,405,4.561643835616438

5613262,5,B00BF2RV9K,"Fantastic album. I hope the Avett Brothers put out Live volume 4 soon. If you haven't seen them live, you need to. They are best when heard live. One of my favorite top 5 bands of the last 5 yrs.",1423699200,,195,3.9
5613263,4,B00BF2RV9K,A great CD.  The Avett Brothers got better with time and this was mostly music from their earlier days.,1422403200,,103,4.421052631578948

5613266,5,B00BF2RV9K,"This record does an excellent job of capturing the live energy of one of the best live acts around.  Let's be honest.  Some Avett Brothers studio recordings just don't have the energy of a live performance. When I want to introduce the Avett Brothers to someone, I start with this album.",1404086400,,287,4.607843137254902

5613271,5,B00BF2RV9K,This dvd captures the essence of what it is like to actually be there live experiencing the Avett's. I have seen them 6 times and this dvd illustrates how energetic and ongoing their concerts truly are.,1386633600,,202,4.638888888888889
5613272,4,B00BF2RV9K,Best brother duo since the Everly Brothers.  Excellent song writing with pure as the driven snow melodies and harmonies.  Dig the cello like a fiddle man...,1381881600,,156,4.961538461538462
5613273,5,B00BF2RV9K,"I do not want this review to reflect poorly on the product, which is a great companion to the Live: Volume 3 cd. It is quite fun if you are already familiar with the cd, because on this video you see the performances of the songs you know from the album. This is a great introduction to The Avett Brothers for anyone who has not seen them live and has friends or family that rave about them. They are wonderful recorded, but the concerts are something else entirely. This offers a bit of glimpse of that, plus short interviews with the band, family and fans.",1379289600,,558,4.3238095238095235

5613276,4,B00BF2RV9K,"I saw this show on Palladium several years ago and had it DVR'd but it was accidentally deleted several months back.  Love this performance.

Con - package came and dvd shrink wrap was opened, making me wonder if it is actually a 'new' product.  Looks ok and plays fine so no biggie to me.",1374624000,,289,4.314814814814815
5613277,2,B00BF2RV9K,"After reading strong reviews for this dvd ordered it and after three months finally got it from someone Amazon referred me to because the demand was so high it was unavailable from them. Only two songs were on it I recognized [Murder In The City] and [I and Love and You]. This was an unpolished performance given in 2009. Their best music by far is a performance on CMT's ""Crossroads"" with Randy Travis that I only saw on UTUBE and is now restricted to a three minute sample. Does anyone out there know of any DVD of that show out there or plans to produce one?",1373846400,,562,4.311320754716981
5613278,5,B00BF2RV9K,The Avett Brothers are always great live! I loved the live 3 cd so I was not disappointed by this dvd! Of course I would always pick a live show over a dvd but this brings me back to all the times I've seen them live!,1371340800,,217,3.739130434782609
5613279,5,B00BF2RV9K,"First group I've gotten into in quite a while. Lyrics like Dylan,Burton Cummings,Hank Williams Sr. Unique harmony and individual vocals. Musiic reminds me of ELO ,Moody Blues etc. FantasticReccomend to most any stage appearence on dvd. Although I can hear traces of other groups they are completely themselves.",1366156800,,310,5.479166666666667
5613280,5,B00BF2RV9K,"I thought this band's studio recordings were amazing, but seeing them live is a completely different story. The Avett Brothers are true performers -- they play with a certain charm, energy, and sincerity that I haven't quite seen in any other band. This DVD has now got me AMPED for their Georgia show with Old Crow in May.

This DVD seems to be a re-release of the one that came out in 2010. Not sure what the reason for this is, and I haven't watched the earlier edition, but this appears to be the same exact product.

Plenty of my favorites are found on this live DVD, such as ""I and Love and You,"" ""Talk on Indolence,"" ""Colorshow,"" ""Distraction #74,"" ""Kick Drum Heart,"" ""Swept Away,"" ""When I Drink,"" and an old favorite, ""I Killed Sally's Lover."" There aren't many songs from Carolina Jubilee or Mignonette, though, which is slightly disappointing since their earlier albums contain some of my favorites. This was made before The Carpenter, so there's nothing from that album either. But this is still an amazing DVD that showcases some of the Avett Brothers' finest work. You can even find some brief interviews with each band member between songs -- very cool. These guys are so fun to watch; each member is so talented, and it's mindblowing to see them hold out those sweet harmonies.

If you are a fan of the Avett Brothers, folk/Americana, or music in general, do yourself a favor and pick this one up. And if you haven't heard any Avett Brothers tunes yet, well, you've been missing out!",1366070400,9,1498,4.645283018867924
5613281,5,B00BF2RV9K,Love this DVD! The concert and the commentary are excellent in terms of both content and audio-video quality. Truly a great concert and glad to have it on DVD.,1360540800,,159,4.517241379310345
5613282,5,B00BF2RV9K,"If you are a fan of the Avett Brothers, you will love this DVD. The sound quality is great. I only wish they offered it on Blu-ray.",1329436800,,131,3.888888888888889
5613283,5,B00BF2RV9K,"I purchased this dvd as a birthday gift for a friend in addition to The Avett Brothers GP promo flyer for I and Love and You. The product was excellent and exactly as promised -- wrapped and unopened with no damage to the case, and the disc inside was also perfect.

Images are crisp and clear with great definition, and sound quality is nice. It seems to be a very well-produced video and captures the heart of The Avett Brothers. She has already watched the dvd several times (I have joined her twice), and we were both highly impressed with the energy of the band -- and the energy of the audience as well. This was, in short, the perfect choice of a gift for someone who is as die-hard an AB fan as my friend is, and I am extraordinarily pleased it.

Delivery time was efficient, production is exceptional, and the dvd is truly excellent. Five stars.",1323648000,,854,4.39873417721519
5613284,5,B00BF2RV9K,I love love love the Avett Brothers and after seeing their concert I kept telling everyone that their energy onstage cannot be described by listening to their albums alone...they have a way to take a song they have sung hundreds of times and make it new every time...this video totally captures the way the Avett Brothers really are as performers...If you are a fan you will love this DVD and if you are not you will be by the time it is over!,1321920000,,443,4.349397590361446
5613285,5,B00BF2RV9K,After seeing the Avett brothers in concert I had to get this DVD.  It's great to watch and listen to as they are an amazing group of talented performers.

5613287,5,B00BF2RV9K,I think this DVD is a great representation of the energy and fun of a TAB live show. Whether you've seen them dozens of times or not at all this DVD will be fun for you. A great glimpse into what the Avett Brothers and thief fans are all about,1300320000,,243,3.88
