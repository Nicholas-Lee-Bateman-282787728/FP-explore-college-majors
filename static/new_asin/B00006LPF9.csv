I really only watch this type of movie for the race scenes and for the cars and there's a couple good scenes that are worth watching.  The main car in it is a white S14 Silvia with Momo wheels and a super clean kit and the intro was shot really cool.  I like the main character Dimo, a high class gangster.  There's a real good car chase with an older Impreza WRX, I think it was a Club Spec Evo 3, a model that wasn't available in the U.S. which is like a gem to an import enthusiast.  Other then that it's just funny, their's a scene where they use their cars to cripple people.  The whole movie just makes me laugh.  This movie is worth cult classic status, I think I'll put it on the shelf next  to Initial D.",1371945600,,838,4.060975609756097
7972246,1,B00006LPF9,"I can't even say how lame this movie was. The guy that wrote it, all the cast, the director, and anyone who had anything to do with making this movie should be kicked the face with a golf shoe for making me lose IQ points sitting through it. I just lost more IQ points seeing the cover for my review.",1183939200,,300,4.016666666666667
7972247,1,B00006LPF9,"This movie synopsis is the most misleading movie synopsis that has ever existed. If there was ever movie that was the poster child for Bait and Switch Tactics this movie would be it. The movie has almost nothing to do with cars except for one short and pathetic chase, and everything to do with drug dealing and gangs. Which is fine if the movie was advertised as such, but it isn't.

As a large fan of the compact sport scene this movie is by far the worst ""Car"" movie ever created. For those who thought the cars in The F&F line of movies were ""Riced"" out, this movies redefines ""Rice"" With its horrible cars that feature a more than ""Riced"" out Nissan 200SX and several other cars that were obviously rejects from ""The Fast and The Furious"" line of movies. There is nothing attractive about the cars except possibly the right hand drive SS that only shows up for about a minute during the movie.

Overall if you ever get the urge to watch this movie, your time is better spent watching re-runs of Saved By The Bell.",1152489600,,1018,4.409574468085107
7972248,1,B00006LPF9,"I think I've finally found the worst movie ever created. Seriously, Red Lined is the dumbest, most pointless film ever put together. The DVD package makes it look like it's about racing, Fast and Furious style. However, ten minutes into the movie there was no racing, and i became pretty concerned. Turns out there's no racing at all in the movie, the movie instead focuses on a poorly developed ""plot"" that involves little more than a rich european guy with a riced out nissan and his buddies being pissed off at some other people that don't play that big of a part in the movie at all. It's safe to say that i'm a lot dumber through watching this movie. After I finished it (yes, i sat through the whole thing... i thought it could get better) I was so pissed that i went outside and threw the dvd into the street just to have someone else find it and get pissed off like i was. i should've taken a mallet and crushed the thing into pieces. The acting is weak, the cars could be better, the lines make absolutely no sense at all, and a drunk retarded monkey could have used better cinematography than these guys did. Horrible. Absolutely horrible.",1079308800,3,1149,4.450236966824645
7972249,2,B00006LPF9,"Ok the reason this movie got even two stars was cuz the cars were pretty decent. I saw this for rent at a video store one day and being a big fan of the import racing scene I had to see it. It was so lame, it was about like drug dealers and gangs and all that crap. The closest thing to racing in this was a chase on a highway. Not worth the money I paid to rent it. Don't make the same mistake I did cuz ur wasting ur time.",1062374400,,424,3.619565217391304
7972250,3,B00006LPF9,not a bad movie alittle hard to understand what they are saying because they are using a british or english accent.  the movie didn't really have much of a budget and no wheres near the budget of fast and furious movies.  but the cars and the driving make up for it.  i first saw it in a video store but i never heard anything about the movie so it sparked my curiousity.  i couldn't find a trailer for it so i just went and bought it at the video store on dvd.  i reccomend if you want to see it rent or buy the dvd.  the widescreen is a pretty good transfer.  the picture is pretty clean but the sound lacks because its a dolbly 2.0 not dolby digital.  i couldn't find a place that had the dvd for rentthe video store only had the vhs for rent so i bought the dvd.  i paid less...so i got my moneys worth.,1056844800,2,807,3.9627329192546585
