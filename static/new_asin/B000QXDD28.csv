2851752,1,B000QXDD28,"I must confess in regards to the so-called documentary...if mis-information is what you are looking for?! Look no further. From the get go when Lucifer is said to be another name for Satan you can sure bet that single minded Christian antics are at work here.
 There is so much to gripe about here that I will say this: HOGWASH.
Avoid this at all costs and look for more interesting documentaries such as: Satanis, Omen Legacy, Angeli Bianchi-Angeli Neri, Scream Greats Volume 2:Satanism and Satanic Witchcraft, and a really good documentary on the Mondo Macabro release ""Satanico Pandomonium"".",1202169600,21,594,5.061224489795919
2851753,4,B000QXDD28,"This documentary proved quite informative, as well as value for money. Despite scant attention being given to pre-Christian concepts of evil and the underworld, the real pleasure was the bonus feature, 'Hell: The Devil's Domain', which runs substantially longer than the first feature and delves into the many fascinating artistic interpretations of Satan and his kingdom of Hell. Excerpts from interviews with various academics, authors and Jesuit Theologians are woven into the narrative, which lends the material much articulation. Unfortunately for Christians, it won't scare people back into church. But it does shed some light on the origins and evolution of one of the most fascinating literary figures of all time. For those interested in delving further, read Jeffrey Burton Russell's seminal works on the subject, especially 'Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages' and 'Mephistopheles: The Devil in the Modern World'.",1193788800,12,927,5.535211267605634
2851754,3,B000QXDD28,"""From the dawn of the universe to this very day, Satan is believed to roam the earth, vowing to destroy man. Where there is light, Satan brings darkness. Where there is peace, he wages war. Where he finds love, he ushers in hate. Join us as we tell the story of the fallen angel Lucifer, the light bearer, who became the keeper of darkness."" - Ancient Almanac, History Channel.
Basically, a run-down of the mythological historicity of the Judeo-Christian depiction of Satan throughout the ages, including those allegedly in league with Lucifer, like the erstwhile ""witches"" of Europe and Salem, the Catholic Church's propagandizing and scare-tactics, with commentaries by theologians. Towards the end of the program, scenes from Satanis are displayed, naming The Church of Satan a ""cult"", which we are definiely not - needless to say, we are a religion and philosophy fully recognized by the government, yet this is a mistake commonly made on such documentaries repeatedly, with very few exceptions. One would think that if such a presentation were to air scenes from Our Archival material, the producers would make some sort of effort to gather factual information from Us, but I digress. This presentation is nothing too spectacular - the high points are some nice artwork, from Dore' to Albrecht Durer.",1084752000,,1305,5.074418604651163

8198160,1,B000QXDD28,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchased this.  It is a complete waste of money and so innaccurate--I threw it away rather than even pass it on to Goodwill!!  From a Biblical perspective there are so many inaccuracies.  The way it is presented it makes it seem as if all the information comes from the Bible, which it doesn't.  And much is left out about Satan from other religious perspectives.  Again a waste of time--",1398729600,,434,4.443037974683544
8198161,5,B000QXDD28,"Like A&E programs and I did enjoy this one. It had some interesting points and it will fit well in my library of biblical study items. If you like A&E as well, think you would like this item.",1357948800,,191,4.052631578947368
8198162,5,B000QXDD28,"Satan (Hebrew:  ha-Satan), ""the opposer"",[1] is the title of various entities, both human and divine, who challenge the faith of humans. Well thats pretty much it right there but the DVD is at it's best on the bonus fea. Hell Satan's Domain it's longer and better the the main documantary. Is all about in many religious traditions, a hell is a place of suffering and punishment in the afterlife. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as endless. Religions with a cyclic history often depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations. Typically these traditions locate hell under the Earth's external surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living. So yeah over all is a pretty good DVD in my opinion!",1321920000,,758,4.875968992248062
8198163,3,B000QXDD28,"The main material is weak. (not worth it)
BUT, the EXTRA material is good.
Not bad for the money.",1231286400,,97,4.157894736842105
8198164,1,B000QXDD28,"I found the '07 release, `Biography - Satan: Prince of Darkness' to be an extremely shallow examination of the history of the Devil. It is narrow in scope, incomplete, lacking in content. The documentary limits itself only to the Christian perspective which is fine if that was the target audience it was aiming for. I found it surprising that even within the narrow scope of the Judeo-Christian faiths the program is unable to provide anything profound or meaningful in its allotted 141 minutes.

The program is at best a bare bones, cursory approach to the subject matter, offering no pertinent information or insight on the nature of metaphysical evil. In fact the narrative is so poorly scripted it borders on being downright laughable. There is so much left out and what is there is poorly presented.

Blatant Omissions:
- There is no mention of the offspring of the ""Sons of God"" (angels) known as the Nephilim.
- The Templars are nowhere to be found.
- Mephistopheles, the most important demonic figure of the 20th century is never mentioned (they do show an illustration of him).

These are but a few of the problems with this presentation, there are many more. I recommend that you pass on this one.",1202169600,23,1208,4.798076923076923
