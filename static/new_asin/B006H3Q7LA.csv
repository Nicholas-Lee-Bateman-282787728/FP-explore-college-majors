4988440,1,B006H3Q7LA,"As an ardent fan of Charles Dickens, I am always open to any film adaptation in this day and age of his work, and have to admit that I was quite excited for this new 2011 production of ""Great Expectations"". While not my favorite of his novels, it nonetheless has a plethora of possibilties when dramatized for the screen, be it big or small. Nonethless, after viewing, I couldn't help but feel a trifle let down.

I've watched several BBC/Masterpiece productions and found them all to be enjoyable, but this one was a chore to watch, even in installments. It wasn't just the rushed pacing, the artsy, color-drained cinematography that feels more appropriate for a horror movie than Dickens, the brutal watering down of his brilliant prose into bland, almost inanely simplified dialogue, or the dropping of important chunks of the novel in favor of inserting newly-imagined scenarios that add nothing but smuttiness to the story (i.e., the inappropriate and unnecessary brothel scene, or the completely travestuous ""lake"" moment between Pip and Estella) that made me give this film one star; it was the fact that it just felt too modern to be a really good adaptation of Dickens, and that the very spirit of the book was conspicuously absent throughout the entire three hours.

While it's something very hard to explain, it simply never struck me as feeling ""authentic"", either in a historial sense or a dramatic one. Everything felt forced, like the filmmakers didn't really believe in what they were creating, and the actors just wanted to get through their lines as quickly and painlessly as they could. Honestly, I might never have known this was supposed to be ""Great Expectations"" aside from the occasional appearance of Miss Havisham. Sure, the sets look authentic and the costumes are beautiful, but the script feels like a soap-opera styled parody of the book, with acting to match. Douglas Booth, who plays Pip, along with Vanessa Kirby as Estella, never seem to really grasp that they are supposed to be living in the 19th century instead of modern-day, and give stilted, unoriginal performances. I did mildly enjoy Gillian Anderson as the quite mad and ethereal Miss Havisham, though I think Helena Bonham-Carter can do better.

One thing that Charles Dickens' books are well known for is their wittiness and whimsical humour. Even his darkest tales have pepperings of light scattered throughout to lift the mood and create a style uniquely his own. This film has left those credos by the wayside and opted for a far more bleak, shadowy, and humourless rendition, with nothing left but dull and depressing scenes of boring, colorless characters with nothing even remotely interesting to do or say. Character development doesn't happen as often as it should, and in consequence leaves you with little emotional connection to the characters themselves by the end of the film. Pip and Estella's complicated relationship is reduced to a cliched collection of invented scenes, and that between Joe Gargery and Pip, both as a youngster and as an adult, is almost nonexistent.

As I mentioned before, the biggest con for me was the fact that the dialogue has been so oversimplified that you might not know if it was Dickens or not. With other BBC productions, at least of few quotes come verbatim from the pages of the book, helping to bring the world of Victorian England to life, but not so here. The glorious, fanciful language of the time is diminished so heavily that it might just as well been written yesterday instead of in 1860. Without his words, Dickens just isn't Dickens; but apparently Sarah Phelps, the screenwriter, didn't quite comprehend that.

A bit too artsy and modern for my own taste, I was disappointed in the BBC for allowing this to be their Charles Dickens bicentennial production, knowing that they can do and have done much better than this in the past. There is no doubt that this film will appeal to many people, but as for myself, I prefer to wait for Mike Newell's upocoming cinematic adaptation, for which I have much greater expectations.",1333929600,99,4077,4.920058139534884
4988441,1,B006H3Q7LA,"I decided to give this new production a try, since I enjoy Dickens (Check out ""Our Mutual Friend""-5 stars). After watching the first installment on Masterpiece, I said there's something missing here. Before the second installment, I decided to review an earlier production from the BBC from 2004. It had been many years since I read Great Expectations, and that production had left me wondering, how good was it?  After watching it again, I realized how good it was. For me, there is no comparison between the 2012 and the 2004. The Rampling/Waddell production is all Dickens, filled with turns and twists that naturally flow out of the story, nothing forced, nothing artificial. The acting is wonderful, the sets wonderful. All the elements are there for a great story.  Most of all, there are the wonderful Dickens characters, complex and human, people you care about for good or bad. It is richly Dickens, in only the way he can tell.
As for the other, it is flat, stale, cliched, and forced. I found the characters two dimensional and undeveloped with no depth or complexity, rather the production of a hurried Hollywood screenwriter on a timetable. No amount of good acting brings this story to life. Exploitive, rather, it seems. You can see this kind of production every night on a TV channel.
If you want Dicken's Great Expectations, stick to the 2004 BBC production. Wonderful.
The other, well, just plain terrible.",1333929600,11,1424,4.904564315352697
4988442,2,B006H3Q7LA,"This story is rushed and boring as presented. There is little to no character development, zero humor and little explanation.

The younger main character is great but the adult actor (douglas booth) has a wooden face that does not express emotion. No connection with any character in this version.

Compared to delights like Little Dorrit (2008) and Bleak House - this barely scratches the surface of what dickens adaptions can be.

In short - this was disappointing to watch as the acting by the main model-looks booth seemed off and not easy to identify with characters/storylines.",1333929600,5,583,5.052083333333333
4988443,5,B006H3Q7LA,We are Gillian Anderson fans from the X-Files days.  It was great to see her in this Dickens classic.  She does a marvelous job!  The whole thing was very entertaining.,1333929600,,168,4.533333333333333
4988444,5,B006H3Q7LA,"Great Expectations takes a dark route to the thick of things in this new presentation.  The characters' story-lines' complexity is amped up, the clash of classes are heavily emphasized, and the plot takes slight detours from the original.

Pip becomes the unfortunate target of Miss Havisham's bad intentions.  As a practice boy for Estella to break, Pip must struggle with his desire for her and his ambition for grandeur.  Miss Havisham is portrayed beautifully by Gillian Anderson as a pearly white ghost bride that haunts Satis House.  Douglas Booth performs brilliantly as Pip who is stuck between classes and between potential benefactors.  Characters Biddy, the Wopsole, and the Hubbles are completely deleted.  The Pocket Family has a only a brief cameo.  This will outrage purists but their deletion allows for more density to be added to the plot of the other characters.  The extra backstory of Miss Havisham's brother as a collector of beauty was very intriguing.

Pip is led to believe early on he is destined for great things.  Miss Havisham imbues in the boy a sense of wonder for the world beyond the forge.  This leads to a letdown that places Pip squarely in his place.  Miss Havisham uses the phrase ""your people"" many times to refer to Pip's family also as a way of knowing one's place.  Bentley Drummle can see through Pip's forced eloquence to something that does not belong to society.  And even Pip the gentleman treats Joe rather sharply and coldly.

The slight detours I mention might upset Dickensonian elitists but the change is refreshing.  Nothing happens that is not within what the characters are capable of.  Magwitch's wife Molly's relationship to Mr. Jaggers is more intimate than in the book.  Miss Havisham is more ethereal and flighty (if possible) than the original.  Estella and Pip share an almost intimate moment.  And there are a few others that might surprise you...

All in all, this is a fresh version veiled in Gothic romance and Victorian elegance.  The acting is superb, the cinematography is like watching a painting at times, and the presentation in full is exquisite.  I have read this book many many times and this version has revitalized the original and I feel I have read for the first time, again.",1333843200,6,2254,4.902116402116402
4988445,5,B006H3Q7LA,"First-off: since there are those who object to comments made on a single episode of a series on PBS that is yet to be release on DVD, then be aware that this comment is made based only on Episode 1 of 3 Episodes of the new version of Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS.  Having said that, this first episode introduces us to a spooky, otherworldly atmosphere for the great Dickens novel. Sarah Phelps has adapted Dickens for this triptych presentation and the piece is directed with style and great attention to atmospheric detail by Brian Kirk.

The orphan Pip (Oscar Kennedy) works for blacksmith Joe Gargery (Shaun Dooley) and his Dickinsonian shrew of a wife Mrs. Joe (Clair Rushbrook) whose relative Pumblechook (Mark Addy) has designs on the future.  Working with Pip is the evil Dolge Orlick (Jack Roth).  Pip is wandering the foggy flatlands, comes across escaped criminal Abel Magwitch (Ray Winstone) and befriends him  - an act that obviously bodes well for Pip's future.  Mr and Mrs Joe receive notice from a Miss Havisham (Gillian Anderson) that she wishes to have Pip, and the Gargery family sees a way out of the drudgery in which they live. Pip is off to Miss Havisham's cobwebbed home where she remains secluded from the world since her jilted wedding day.  She `adopts' Estella (Izzy Meikle-Small) and seeks a playmate for her  - her reason for bringing Pip into the strange home.  Bad derring-does happen - Mrs. Joe is practically killed by Orlick, some strange vibrations occur in the Havisham household, etc.  Seven years pass and solicitor Jaggers (David Suchet) visits the home and informs the household that Pip has inherited a great sum of money form an unknown benefactor and wants Pip (now the strikingly handsome Douglas Booth) to go to London to become a  gentleman with great expectations, following in the steps of Estella (now Vanessa Kirby).  And that is where we leave the group at the end of episode 1.

In this amount of time the moods of the flatlands and the poverty of the poor class have been beautifully drawn as has the bizarre home and disheveled mind of Miss Havisham. The seeds for the rest of the story have been sown and it is with great interest that the following two episodes will carry this version.  It is recommended to use subtitles with this series as the various dialects are tough to translate for the American ear.  But Dickens this is and a fine beginning.  Highly recommended viewing.

4988446,5,B006H3Q7LA,"This is a purely technical inquiry. I want to purchase this DVD but I own an older cathode tube TV. Consequently, I'm worried that the aspect ratio on this DVD will not fit my 32-inch screen. The version I watched tonight on PBS was all scrunched up (characters abnormally tall and skinny) I don't want to purchase this DVD if that is the aspect ratio I am buying. Now if this is letterbox, I assume the problem will resolve itself. Can anyone advise me if I will have a problem with this DVD?",1333324800,,493,4.311827956989247
4988447,2,B006H3Q7LA,I watched the beginning of the first episode on PBS and found it annoying in general. Most of the heavy regional and class accents used (for 'atmosphere' I suppose) were only partly intelligible and this added to the fact that it is far from the best work of Dickens caused me to turn it off and go to bed. BBC productions of Dickens don't have to be only partly intelligible to US audiences as the Martin Chuzzlewit and David Copperfield adaptions make clear. It depends upon the actors and the direction I would think. PS I went to university in the UK (two years at Cambridge) so I am not an American unfamiliar with the UK or English speech. Of course at Cambridge most English was the Queen's English which presents no problems to Americans.,1333238400,13,746,4.533333333333333
4988448,5,B006H3Q7LA,"Some books are just purely cinematic. Great Expectations is one of them, with all the elements of a perfect gothic story: the mad woman, the creepy old house full of cobwebs and bitter memories, the stretch of the forge and the sinister man who arises from the mud to slam the young hero to the ground and threaten his life. This recent adaptation by the BBC is a visual masterpiece, full of understated and wonderful performances, as atmospheric a tale as Charles Dickens could have imagined.

The solitary Miss Havisham (Gillian Anderson) has not been seen by any of the locals in many years, not since she was jilted on her wedding day. Now shut up in her great old house, which still bears the ghosts of wounded memories in the form of a moth-eaten wedding gown and rat-infested marriage cake, she decides to enlist the assistance of a forge boy, young Pip (Oscar Kennedy), in entertaining her ward, Estella (Izzy Meikle-Small). Hoping to raise the girl to avenge the sins of her former lover, her innocent appeal causes Pip's family, which includes his unhappy sister, her good-natured husband, and their greedy uncle, to think that perhaps they might rise in society as a result of it. Miss Havisham encourages Pip to be ambitious and hints that he may have great expectations for the future, only to turn around and deprive him of the one thing he wants most, condemning him to the life of a bond servant learning the trade as a blacksmith.

But that is not the end of Pip's journey, nor his relationship with Miss Havisham... for seven years later, Pip (Douglas Booth) is informed by a London solicitor (David Suchet) that he has inherited a great sum of money. It requires abandoning his current life and becoming a gentleman in society... a plan that will reintroduce him to Estella (Vanessa Kirby) once more.

I have enjoyed this adaptation. It is different from the source material in some respects (and that certainly will give book enthusiasts reason to complain) but it avoids the over theatricality of the roles and instead chooses a far more natural approach. Gillian Anderson chooses to play Miss Havisham both as a woman fully aware of what she is doing and as such, dedicated to evil (though she may not truly know it) and as a vulnerable child in a mature body, forever stuck in one place with no hope of moving forward. The acting here is really remarkable from everyone involved, but particularly so from the young lead. His Pip is all at once a lovely child and one we feel deeply for, yet we are similarly fascinated with Estella and her grim companion.

While certain elements are dramatically different from the book (in order to create a more modern ending) and the second episode stumbles a bit in maintaining the pace of its other parts, this is an enjoyable adaptation that avoids some of the sins of its predecessors while also offering romantics an ending that will make them happy. It is not perfect but it is quite good, and well worth the three hours required to discover its mysteries.",1332374400,101,3022,4.706994328922495

4988452,3,B006H3Q7LA,"I watched each episode of this adaptation immediately after reading the corresponding section of the book, so I can say with absolute certainty that it does not follow the source material very well.  I always wonder at screenwriters who feel they can improve on Dickens, he gives you most of the dialogue and it is brilliant - so use it...and the plot! The changes made from the book were not just for time compression either,  but some were completely unnecessary. I also watched the 2013 version with Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes and it is far, far, more faithful to the book with a lot of original dialogue and fewer major changes. If you want a truer adaptation go with that one.

That being said,  as a standalone film experience this is fine.  It is well acted and visually stunning. It just isn't really Dickens.",1511136000,,829,4.6506849315068495

Gillian Anderson is memorable as Miss Havisham; Ray Winstone is frightening as Magwitch, and Daniel Booth is a beautiful Pip..

Great Expectations is a story with so many multidimensional themes that I believe get lost in this version. Friendship, sacrifice, revenge, arrogance, humility, the danger of controlling the direction of someone's life, and hope; never really seem to emerge from its continual gloom to have any lasting effect. And in the end it fails to bring us up to the point of where Pip would naturally end, where Dickens' has him end, where we would all end, and because of that, it leaves you flat. Somewhere along the way they forgot that Dickens wrote a ""coming-of-age"" story.

It made me want to know her complete story including  her childhood, her fiancee, and  the events leading up to her being stood up at her wedding. And near the end where she realizes what a horrible thing she has done playing with and ruining Pip and Estella's lives like that and decides to set herself on fire, I felt myself thinking  ""No don't do that!""

4988586,3,B006H3Q7LA,"I loved the cinematography, very atmospheric.  The characters as played by the actors seemed mismatched.  Pip seemed a lot younger than Estella when they were adults.  Plus, Gillian Anderson did not make a good Miss Havisham as her face did not age, probably due to all those fillers and botox.  I hope the British television and movie industry doesn't get youth obsessed and end up with otherworldly plasticky actors like we have in the U.S.",1452988800,,442,4.8533333333333335
4988587,5,B006H3Q7LA,"Just spectacular: the acting, the settings, the music. Gillian Anderson was wonderful. So was the actress who played Estella. She easily could have come across as unlikeable, but instead she came across as wounded and damaged, which was exactly right. I am generally a fan of period dramas like this so I was expecting to like it, but it surpassed my expectations. Of course, the credit goes in great part to Dickens. It's an excellent story, full of tension and irony and life lessons about love, forgiveness, wealth and status.",1452816000,3,529,4.888888888888889

4988593,4,B006H3Q7LA,"This adaptation of Dickens' classic has taken a few liberties with the plot, but in the end, delivers  a moving performance by the main characters.  Strong performances form Pip, Miss Havisham and Stella carry the story line to a somewhat inconclusive end.  In the original work, there is no reunion between Pip and Stella.  However, this adaptation suggests such a final outcome.  Nevertheless, through the skillful narrative one is magically carried to the nineteenth century England and immersed in the scenes and sounds of the day. The original novel is more poignant and sad in tone,but the adaptation does not quite rise up to reflect that sentiment.",1449014400,,656,5.093457943925234

This section of my review is about the movie.

I love Dickens', his writing is superb! The BBC has done a terrific job with this Film Adaptation, which follows the book very well. It is broken in three parts, but all in one disc. The acting is superb and the movie is fine. I highly reccomend this version of ""Great Expectations"" versus other ones. It most closesly resembles the book  and (in my opinion) the actors are really do a very good job at acting as their characters.

I watched this product for over a year, but the price never really budged from $17. Few cents up, few cents down.",1433721600,,682,4.432

4988717,3,B006H3Q7LA,"It's a great story, and the adaptation is passable, but this isn't in the same class as the adaptations of ""Bleak House"" from 2005 and 1985, with Gillian Anderson and Diana Rigg respectively.  ""Great Expectations"" is a shorter novel, but this version, at 3 hours (3 hourly episodes), seems too short, especially in the last two episodes, which seem rushed and a bit perfunctory in their treatment of plot.  The pacing of the first episode -- to the point where Pip leaves for London -- seems right, and it's partly because of what we see of life with the Gargerys there that makes us feel the relative absence of them from the later episodes.  Pip's relation, while in London, to Joe and his old life doesn't get the weight it should.  Also, there's no Aged Parent, no Wopsles, no Biddy, and the ending is far too neatly wrapped up -- no eleven years in Cairo with the Pockets here, and the resolution is too easily achieved, and to that extent very different from either of Dickens's endings.  In short, I'm not sure we're convinced of the purgatorial fires that Pip and Estella have been through.  Also, I think more effort should have been made to preserve Dickens's language or a reasonable facsimile thereof.  And I don't remember in the novel Estella saying ""Thank you"" to the horse that kills Bentley Drummle, and a don't remember the cute wading in the pond and that first kiss (because it wasn't there!).  I did like the oddly filtered camera work, very sharp, and poised between color and black-and-white. That is especially effective in Satis House (Miss Havisham's home) and on the marshes of the opening scenes.  The London exterior scenes were fine, well up to BBC standard for such things.  I always wonder -- do they close down whole streets for the shoot so that people can go around in crinolines and coaches can drive by?

The casting was uneven.  Douglas Booth and Vanessa Kirby looked good as Pip and Estella, but they lacked energy and chemistry.  They certainly weren't bad -- just a bit pallid.  On the other hand, Gillian Anderson was an arresting and self-tormenting Miss Havisham, definitely not always icily in control of herself.  Ray Winstone was a dangerous and physically imposing Magwitch, but capable of bringing tenderness and humor to the character too.  The lawyer Jaggers, the agent for both Magwitch and Miss Havisham, was well taken by David Suchet and seemed a man almost obsessively uncomfortable with the dirty business of the law but determined not to be broken by it.  In smaller parts, Tom Burke was a credibly nasty Drummle (although I don't remember that scene at his ""club""), and Harry Lloyd and Perdita Weeks were attractive young Pockets.

All in all, then, a mixed bag.  I certainly wasn't sorry to have seen it, but the novel's moral weight doesn't come through, and that's partly the fault of the adapted script and partly a matter of the central young couple not making it quite credible.",1431475200,,2943,4.7578740157480315

4988772,2,B006H3Q7LA,"My favorite book by Dickens, I was really hoping to like this movie, but I didn't. The sets, costumes and cinematography are excellent, but that's about all I liked. Where to begin??

Miss Havisham: Wrong actress. Much too young for the part and, I thought, poorly played; as though she were constantly drugged. She lacked the meanness of spirit portrayed in the book and just seemed to be in a drug induced dreamland all the time.

Estella: Again, wrong actress. In the book she is described over and over as beautiful and this actress, although, not unattractive, is no beauty IMO. She also did not portray Estella's haughtiness, conceit, heartlessness, and in fact at times seemed sensitive to Pip's tribulations.

Pip: Wrong actor. He looks more like a boy band heartthrob than a Dickensian character and was stilted in his portrayal.

The story: strayed greatly from the book which seems rather presumptuous to me, considering the author. Story lines added and deleted as if Dickens' could be improved!

Dialog: Completely left out was Dickens excellent portrayal of the language of the day. Gone too was the biting sarcasm and wit.",1425686400,6,1137,4.963157894736842

4988795,4,B006H3Q7LA,"Read the book several times. Saw a few adaptations (the 1946 version is my favorite) and this one has its good parts and bad parts. I loved this version's Miss Havisham, it really brings out her emotionally disturbed mind. Estella was okay but her dead-pan expression got on my nerves after a while (what did they do - botox her face to get the ""emotionally detached"" look??). The adult Pip's facial features were a little...I don't quite know how to express it...his face seemed oddly shaped, the features a little over-done (sorry, I know that's the face the actor was born with and it is what it is) but it is so distracting (the square jaw, the almond-shaped eyes, the plush lips, the arrow-straight nose)! Anyway, that all aside I loved the scenery, the dreary marsh and the lavish costumes. I know it wasn't 100 percent faithful to the novel and as a writer I would be infuriated if anyone tampered with my ""baby""...all the same, I enjoyed this film adaption.",1422144000,,965,4.649122807017544

4988797,5,B006H3Q7LA,"There are two main markers that make for a good movie. One is intelligent casting. Two a very good script. I think I like this PBS version. It is is one of  the better ones. It has good locations for filming and good actors. Also, there is a real boy casted for young David Copperfield. I hate another version where they casted a very small man for the role. Let's face it for some movies you must have actual children to play the roles. One excellent example is all the remakes of Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens. A 4 foot six man playing Oliver Twist would not be very convincing. I will finish watching this movie because it looks like a good remake.",1421452800,,653,4.308943089430894

4988810,5,B006H3Q7LA,First rate acting in three episodes. I don't know why this is called season 1 as the storyline finishes with episode 3. Gillian Anderson was fabulous as over-the-top Miss. Havisham. Douglas Booth is one of the best-looking Pip's I have ever seen. He does a very good job as the innocent who is transformed by money and material wealth. Harry Loyd as Mr. Pocket is another favorite. Probably the best out of the bunch is Ray Winestone as Magwitch-truely scary. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes Dickens.,1417478400,,518,4.766666666666667

4988831,5,B006H3Q7LA,My husband and I enjoyed the movie tremendously. It was full of unexpected twist and turn that kept us guessing how it would end. It is a great movie for us to see how much people were perceived by their background  as well as how important social status was in early England. (I still belief it may be the case today as well.) How ever I highly recommend this particular version of this classic because I have seen other remake that I didn't enjoy nearly as much.,1415836800,,464,4.333333333333333

The characters of Pip, Herbert, and Magwitch are well-cast and the actors do an admirable job with their roles.  But Estella is not played at all as Estella should be.  Here she is... staring, empty, shallow.  And Miss Havisham has been living this way for a longgg time -- the actress playing her is much too young and not believable.  What happened to Orlick's kidnapping of Pip?  Wemmick's home and father?  Joe remarrying?  And the scene where Pip's heart is breaking as Estella announces her upcoming marriage is one of the most emotional in all of literature!  Nothing.  After reading the book I chose this particular version because of the PBS reputation.  I was disappointed.  READ THE BOOK!

Why do perfectly intelligent, talented people launch a project based upon a classic and much beloved book, only to decide that what people really want is a diluted, hurried, pretentious rendering of the story with a wholly unrecognizable ending. This is one of the few Masterpiece adaptations for which the writer insisted he/she knew better than the author--in this case, Dickens--what the audience wanted.  The cheesy resolution was more than I could take.  And, really, what is with Gillian Anderson's Miss Havisham?  Is this the same woman who graced the Bleak House production with such a profound, heartbreaking performance??? I have seldom been so aware of someone trying to act; it was actually laughable a times.  Otherwise, wonderful acting, beautiful sets, perfect costuming, etc, etc.",1408147200,,809,5.338582677165355

4988939,5,B006H3Q7LA,"This, like many 'versions' of GE is essentially a keeper. I first saw it on Masterpiece Theater a couple of years ago. What I appreciate about ALL the Great Expectations is that they haven't veered much from (with the exception of the more 'modern' adaptation with Paltrow and Ethan Hawke, but was also good) what we've come to expect of this classic.
Gillian Anderson was surprisingly convincing with probably the weirdest and most creepiest Ms. Havisham yet and the young handsome actor Oscar Kennedy nails this role completely. Somewhat disappointing was the actress who portrays Estella however. She didn't possess (as the older Estella) what we've come to expect as the physical beauty nor the convincing emotional vacant-ness we want to see in the performance. Directors should have seen that coming but Oscar Kennedy, himself, as Pip - riveting!",1403136000,,852,5.136690647482014

4988981,1,B006H3Q7LA,"I am a huge Dickens fan and teach this book to my 8th graders every year.  I am also a big fan of BBC and period drama.  David Suchet is one of my all-time favorite actors. Therefore, I had great expectations for a new film version, but this one is not it.  My teenage sons, who are also big BBC and period drama fans and have happily watched many other Dickens and Austen mini-series, made me turn this one off after about twenty minutes because it was so awful.  I struggled through it to the end on my own and wish I hadn't wasted the time. The casting is frequently unconvincing: Mrs. Joe is stout rather than bony and angular, Orlick looks like a zombie, Wopsle is not in the film, Mr. and Mrs. Pocket are not in the film, Gillian Anderson's Miss Havisham is haunting but far too fragile and child-like, David Suchet's role as Jaggers is minimized, we don't get to see Wemmick's castle or the Aged Parent ... I could go on and on).  The film capitalizes on the idea of Miss Havisham's decay as a living death by making everyone looked like they've stepped out of a zombie or vampire flick.  While this is creative in some ways, it just doesn't feel like a faithful Dickens film.  Several plot elements have been altered as well.  A backstory has been added about Miss Havisham's brother hunting down beautiful butterflies and sticking a pin through the heart of beauty (she displays his huge collection to Pip early in the first episode).  When Pip first meets Herbert at Satis House, Herbert behaves as a status-proud prig and fights Pip out of pride -- this is a far cry from the delightfully quirky and gentlemanly bout that earns Pip's admiration in the novel.  Harry Lloyd as the grown-up Herbert is delightful, but he says he was disinherited because of his engagement to Clara (who was actually a secret from his parents in the novel), and his marriage occurs much earlier in the film than in the book.  I particularly disliked the oversimplification of the characters' complex and competing motives.  While the novel leaves the reader in doubt as to whether Magwitch somehow deliberately killed Compeyson in the boat/ship collision, this film has Magwitch brutally stab Compeyson (with lots of blood spurting from Compeyson's mouth) -- this difference is important to Pip's overall evaluation of Magwitch, and to the reader's.  Overall, Ray Winstone is excellent as Magwitch -- his was the most convincing performance in this film.  The scenes between Magwitch and Pip near the end are moving, but they are not enough to justify struggling through an otherwise disappointing adaptation.  This was not up to the standards I expect from Masterpiece Classics or from period drama.  If you want a mostly accurate and delightful version, the David Lean (1946) film is still the best.",1400284800,7,2791,4.735537190082645

4988990,4,B006H3Q7LA,"Interesting, artistic, too rushed with an uneven cast yet even in this compressed version the story is enthralling and I was riveted.

 When young orphan Pip helps an escaped convict in the fens, his destiny will be forever altered, and he will be raised from apprentice blacksmith to gentleman only to realize that his great expectations have fallen short of delivering the happiness, warmth, love and joy he thought his due when he embarked on 'bettering' himself. His illusion is furthered by his adoration of the girl Estella, the adopted daughter of a brewery heiress, Miss Havisham, who jilted on her wedding day, plans revenge on the male gender by raising Estella to break hearts. Estella embodies everything in the fine world Pip aspires to and yet is tainted and twisted through no fault of her own. How Dickens pulled together the threads of this story through an amazing series of coincidences is quite interesting.

As many have pointed out, the child Pip was excellent, adult Pip, far too pretty and Estella suffers by comparison. Sometimes I felt as if I was watching Adonis pay court to a catatonic Minnie Driver! Ray Winstone was a great choice for Magwitch and the child actor who played young Pip was superb. But the show belonged to a bewitching Gillian Anderson as the iconic Miss Havisham.

Anderson has given some fascinating performances--as the chilly Madam in The Crimson Petal, Lily Bart in House of Mirth, Lady Dedlock in Bleak House, The Duchess of Windsor is Any Human Heart  and here she is a marvel --humanizing and making explicable  Miss Havisham's deeds and motivation. She is at once mentally deranged, vulnerable, childlike, punitive and self punishing--and makes the viewer suspect she was unbalanced even before she was jilted- which put her over the edge. The casting of a beautiful younger woman in the role was brilliant, after all Compeyson was not an old man, so why do we all assume white haired Miss Havisham was necessarily old [though both she and her house grow more decrepit and wasted as time went by].

The first part with young Pip was very good, the second fairly good, the third far too rushed. It's been decades since I read the book, so I can't account for the dialogue, though in a version this short I would imagine it was cut considerably--but still the series hits all the salient points of the story.

Interesting to see I wasn't alone in not being thrilled with this version. I actually couldn't finish Episode 3 since I know what's going to happen - being a fan of the original story.

4989009,5,B006H3Q7LA,"I think that this is absolutely one of the best versions of ""Great Expectations"" that I have seen to date. I know that some professional reviewers have labeled this made for TV version as pretty bleak and uninspiring, but I guess that depends on what you are looking for. There is nothing ""pretty"" or ""festive"" about Dicken's book, so why would a director want to turn it into some kind of pretty and elegant extravaganza like a Jane Austin novel ?

""Great Expectations"" IS bleak and it is almost as much about the jilted bride, Miss Havisham, as it is about young Pip. I think that Gillian Anderson does a marvelous job at portraying Miss Havisham as a woman who has been totally destroyed by love and now has devoted her entire life to grooming her young prodigy, Estella ,to win the hearts of men and then destroy them. I find her blank stare and listlessness and her delivery of those incredible lines about love and beauty and deception, remarkable. I have actually known people like her, suffering from clinical depression, who act exactly like that.  Her line: ""Time stands still here, yet everything turns to dust"", is a classic line, which exemplfies her feelings that even if you could stop time, beauty will ultimately age and wither and turn to dust.

The plot, as in most Dickens works, is complex and convoluted with plots within plots so one does need to pay attention. I think that the director delt accurately with the class distinctions of those days and the abject poverty of uneducated rural people. And he,interestingly enough, displayed that there was good and evil at both ends of the spectrum. This is a marvelous study in human nature, showing how people tend to do themselves in by spending their lives in passivity, merely reacting to situations rather than taking charge of their lives and creating situations that will lead to their success and happiness.",1394150400,,1884,4.773006134969325

This made the mundane chore of taking down Christmas decorations very pleasurable.
I thought the actors were amazing although it was difficult to understand some of the dialogue due to the strong accents.  I think there were only 3 times that I did not get exactly what was said though, it wasn't a struggle through the whole series.  Gillian Anderson was great but I think overacted the part a bit.  Maybe it was just the way she over-opened her eyes to appear crazy.....it was a bit too much.  The scene where she burns is very amazing visually, very well done!",1388534400,,776,4.429577464788732

4989048,3,B006H3Q7LA,"As Great Expectations has been my favorite book since I was 9 years old, it's hard for me to decide if I'm nit-picking or not.

First off, I'm always saddened when movies decide that Biddy is a minor enough character to cut, however I can get past cutting her from the movie much easier had they realized that the friendship between Wemmick and Pip is quite important for the flow of the story. As is the friendship between Pip and Joe- yes Pip becomes embarrassed by Joe, but I've read the novel a hundred times and never felt that he would have shunned Joe, he felt like he was protecting Joe from the same embarrassment he (Pip) felt at not measuring up, never understanding that Joe didn't feel inferior. Then there's Estella. Estella just didn't measure up. Continually they show her having what looks like compassion for Pip and others which just doesn't match her character and thus turns the entire tale on its ear. (This IS nit-picking, but I laughed out loud when Herbert thanks Clara's father for her hand in marriage.)

I am willing to suspect that an obscene amount of slash was written about Pip and Herbert, I can't blame the movie on that so much as teen girl culture on the internet.",1385596800,,1200,4.550925925925926

Every bit of warmth, wit, and humor has been sucked out of the plot, leaving only a dry, morose soap opera. I guess the screenwriter thought the plot wasn't current enough, so she invented two scenes, one involving a lake and one involving a brothel, that are not actually in the story. Wemmick, arguably the most interesting supporting character, is barely mentioned, neither is his delightful home and the aged p.

The characters are not portrayed accurately - especially Joe and Miss Havisham who is not bitter but some kind of new age psycho who cares about what people feel.  This movie cut out Biddy?  How do you cut out Biddy when she is the perfect foil for Estella?  The director has also taken license to create some subplots that were just simply not in the original book.

I never even watched or will ever show to a class the rest of this movie.  I went back to my old VHS tapes - my 310 minute version of GE from Disney - the one that stars Anthony Hopkins as Magwitch.  It might leave a few things out, but at least it closely follows the book even down to oftentimes using the exact dialog from the book.

I hope this review keeps you from buying the movie and making the $5.00 mistake I made if you are looking for a rendition of the book that is accurate or even based on what Dickens wished to convey w/his novel.

Pip as a young man is distractingly pretty for the role, frankly; but his acting is very good and believable. My only true complaint of this version is the ending, which leads the viewer to believe that the two characters unite as a couple in the end--quite untrue in the novel.

4989126,1,B006H3Q7LA,"This film fully misses the mark.  First of all, the characterizations of Pip, Joe, Mrs. Joe, Estella, and Miss Havisham are just patently wrong. This minor fault I blame on the Director, screenwriter, and all of the actors, who appeared not to have read the book.  Otherwise, how do you explain a mendacious, mean-spirited young Pip; how do you explain a fluent and wise, angry Joe; how do you explain a seemingly bored and plain-looking Estella; how do you explain the totally unhuman characterization of Mrs. Joe; how do you explain a Lady-Macbeth-like Miss Havisham; how do you explain the older Pip's lips as the only virtue of his acting style; and how in the world do you explain the total absence of Biddy from the film?  You might as well tear out the film's liver....

Sometimes Jillian Anderson actually made me laugh out loud when she went off on one of her mad Lady Macbeth-like soliloquies.  All she had to do was wring her hands a bit more, and I would have been transported back to Inverness. Talk about miscasting: did she think she was still in the X-files?  The turning point for me though was the scene when Pip and Joe go to Satis house to sign his indenture papers, and as Joe puts his hand on Pip's shoulder, Pip jerks himself away in disgust and resentment.

I was anxious to see this version because of the choice of Gillian Anderson to play a relatively young Miss Havisham.  Every other version of Great Expectations had portrayed her as being much too old. I thought that I was in for a faithful retelling of this wonderful story.  But honestly, the disappointment was so great that I could not sit through the first episode.  (a similar experience happened with Masterpiece Mystery's retelling of Agatha Christie's ""Pale Horse,"" which was so badly hacked up by BBC writers that I actually e-mailed them to complain.  Their reply was that this is how their writers hone and perfect their craft!)  But my chief complaint is that when great works are bastardized in this fashion, people who watch, without being familiar with the work, may get the wrong idea about the author. Nobody benefits from this, except perhaps the screenwriter on payday.  Ms. Phelps should be severely chastized for turning Great Expectations into pig swill.

All the versions of this movie that I've seen portray the character as being very elderly and bent over.  Like another reviewer remarked, it would be understandable for her to be in her 40s when she first meets Pip.  I just liked the almost ethereal way she looked--the white makeup, white, disheveled hair, and the wedding dress that becomes shabbier and dirtier each time she makes an appearance and her seemingly innocent, ""deer in the headlights"" look mixed with absolute bitterness and hatred of all things masculine.  The other actor that played his role with all the gusto of a ""bad guy"" was Drummle, the lecherous, abusive man who becomes Estella's husband.  I'm not sure about Pip's character.  I liked the younger version better than the adult version.  Douglas Booth just seemed a little too pretty for that role and didn't really give it much depth. I liked the portrayal of Estella--she was naturally pretty, cold, and aloof.

4989135,2,B006H3Q7LA,"I was so excited to see BBC's newest Dickens adaptation, since the most recent ones have been amazing. (Bleak House and Little Dorrit specifically.) However, this Great Expectations left a lot to be desired.
The best way I can think of describing what went went wrong is that it felt as if the creators tried to un-Dickens-ify (I made that up on the spot!) this fabulous, emotionally wrought, dramatic, fascinating and brilliant story. Dickens's  idiosyncrasies,which add so much intelligence, wit and heart to his novels, are hardly present in this version. I think perhaps the creators decided, ""Ok, we have this classic story  - but it's kind of dated; we need to make it more accessible to a modern audience."" So they stripped it of all its color and personality, leaving only the basic skeleton of the story intact. After watering it down, it was sort of feebly fleshed up again with unnecessary weird stuff.  Great Expectations is a classic for a reason, and I don't really think that many people could create a better story than Dickens. The source material was brilliant and didn't need to be changed- I think it was a huge mistake to tamper with it! So that's my overall perception - the creators tried to revamp a story that didn't need revamping, and in doing so a lot of the power and charm of the story was lost.
Now to get specific:

Miss Havisham: I think Gillian Anderson is a great actress, but was just not suited for the part.
Dickens says, ""Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly wax-work at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress, that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement. Now wax-work and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me."" Anderson is not a skeleton or a ghastly wax work; she is stunningly beautiful,and wrinkeless- no amount of pale makeup and icky hand scabs can make her Dickens' monstrous Miss Havisham! She was interesting, certainly, bringing to the role a certain ethereal whimsy. But, in my mind, Miss Havisham is the haunted, sickly victim of brooding insanity and dusty decay. Everything about her is blighted and surreal. She should be mentally deranged, vindictive skin and bones, spectral and broodingly manipulative.

Pip: Yes, Douglas Booth is incredibly attractive. But that's about it. He doesn't display much emotional complexity in the role,  and does not at all come across as the sensitive and well-intentioned but pretentious and deluded, struggling young man he is in the book. He pretty much just falls flat. Onto his chiseled cheekbones.

Estella: While I think people have been kind of unnecessarily mean about how Estella looks in this adaptation,  I do have to concur that she should be the truly dazzling, stunningly beautiful one, not Pip. Based on how they look in this version, it would seem a lot more likely that Estella would be bowled over by Pip's good looks than the other way around! But my main problem with this representation of the character is the fact that the creators wrote in several scenes with her that were just plain silly and non-existent in the book, perhaps in an attempt to render her more sympathetic. And WHY does she kiss the horse?

Other complaints: Why in the world did they replace Wemmick's Walworth Castle, the Aged P and Miss Skiffins with some pathetic thing about Wemmick growing cucumbers (or some other equally lame vegetable)? They could have at least briefly included it, if they put it in the place of the totally unnecessary and out of place part with Pip, Drummle and some prostitutes.  Also, Joe was essentially gruff and confused looking all the time, instead of being the sweet and lovable character he is in the book. No Biddy. No Mr. Wopsle and Shakespeare.

What I liked: I loved Herbert Pocket, and was amazed to learn that the actor played young Steerforth in BBC's most recent David Copperfield, and that he's actually a descendant of Dickens! Of all the characters, he was the only one who I felt was done full justice in this version. I thought young Pip was very good as well. The cinematography was beautiful and very artistic.

Overall, this adaptation of Great Expectations follows the basic story line but lacks all the vividness, power and inspiration of the original story.",1342137600,6,4381,4.75

4989137,5,B006H3Q7LA,"A bizarre renditon, although entertaining, melodrama that takes off with the Dickensonian concepts of strange characters with descriptive names, dark, foreboding settings of the Victorian age, and moral dilemmas and then, with great liberties, creates three hours of creepiness, sliminess, and craziness.

With all due respect to hardcore Dicken's fans, savor it for what it is: it's Jane Austen gone mad, and I mean that in the best sense of the word.  Young Pip grows up both loved and hated in near poverty.  A rich, eccentric woman takes an interest in him for the sake of her beautiful, but sullen ward.  As Pip grows up pining for her, an unknown benefactor makes him a gentleman, and it is here that his true nature is tested.

It's love, romance, murder, deceit, mystery, decadence, madness all put together and shot wonderfully in country and city, fine and ragged clothes, faithfulness and betrayal.

The actors are super.  Gillian Anderson is over the top as the ghostly frail, vengeful, faded flower holding onto to her painful past.  Watch this after ""Bleak House"" to fully enjoy her skills!

*Spoiler Alert*  The ending provides one of the most romantic and sweet finishes you'll ever see.  After so much pain, lunacy and soap, you're going to need it!",1341792000,,1266,4.95260663507109

4989139,5,B006H3Q7LA,"Dickens' Great Expectations has been filmed so many times that I'm looking for something rather new. In this version, the story has been telescoped to fit into three hours, and some subplots have been dropped (for example, Pip's stay with an academic tutor, and his resolution to court the warmhearted country girl Biddie). Implications and insinuations that would have been clear to Victorian readers have been stated more baldly. For example, the nature of Mr. Jaggers' relationship with his housekeeper, the rake Drummel's leisure pursuits, and the fact that Estella inherited not one but two fortunes. Although the visual effects are uniformly bleak (everything looks like it was shot through a gray filter), the view of some characters is more sympathetic than in the book. Estella is presented as primarily depressed, lonely, and withdrawn rather than a vindictive flirt. Magwich is an aspiring father figure, rather than a man who wants to beat the social system by use of his proxy Pip. Miss Havisham is a breathless wounded child, rather than an elderly nutcase as in some films. (Indeed, if she was jilted in the 1810s at the age of 18 or so, she would probably have been under 40 when Pip first met her.) The film brings out that many people's expectations were thwarted in addition to Pip's, and also, Dickens' message that love is more important than money. Some viewers will find the ending overly optimistic, but why not have one version that fulfills the longing of many readers? (Even Dickens softened the ending in his first draft after receiving comments from writer friends; in his first draft, Estella remarries someone else, remains condescending toward Pip, and Pip stays single.)",1340323200,,1703,5.042553191489362

What results is one of his most intriguing and suspenseful plots, as well as a cast of unforgettable characters, namely a protagonist that goes through serious character development, and two haunting female leads that could easily have carried a novel by themselves.

Orphaned Pip leads an uneventful life, in which the most exciting thing to ever befall him is running across an escaped convict on the moors that surround his house. Out of fear he brings the man a file; out of kindness he also brings him a bit of mutton pie. When the man is recaptured, he doesn't give Pip's complicity away. Though Pip never forgets the man, there are soon more interesting developments to monopolize his attention: the eccentric and reclusive Miss Havisham has asked for Pip's presence at her ramshackle Satis House, to serve as a playmate for her adopted daughter Estella. Eager to change the family's fortunes, Pip's sister sends him along, though her husband Joe has reservations.

Years pass and Estella is sent to London to become a lady, whilst Pip is apprenticed to Joe as a blacksmith. And then, another surprise: a lawyer appears out of nowhere to bestow upon Pip a fortune, telling him that a secret benefactor wishes him to go to London and become a gentleman. Off he goes, determined to become worthy of Estella's hand in marriage. But naturally, there is more than meets the eye to Pip's abrupt change of fortunes, and throughout the novel Dickens plays with the familiar tropes of the Mysterious Benefactor and the Rags to Riches plot, leading Pip to heartbreak and self-discovery before ending on a rather ambiguous note.

Such a story makes for great cinema, and so far the novel has been adapted into so many versions (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1946/dp/B00000F17E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1946</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1974/dp/B001OBKWNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1974</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1998/dp/B000BOH904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1998</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2004/dp/B0002XVRGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2004</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2005/dp/B0009PVZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2005</a>, as well as a forthcoming one directed by Mike Newell starring Helena Bonham Carter) that it's difficult to keep track of them all. Rich in Gothic imagery (the desolate moors, the embittered mad woman, the criminal underbelly, the forsaken house) and surprising twists, this version of the tale certainly makes the most of its evocative atmosphere. Everything seems to have been shot through a blue filter or else is awash with mist, lending the entire production a cold and bleak air.

Stand outs among the cast are Oscar Kennedy and Izzy Meikle-Small as the young Pip and Estella. They're so beguiling in their roles and performances that it was a disappointment when the inevitable switch to their adult selves came. Couldn't we have just stuck with the kids? Unfortunately Douglas Booth as Pip looks ridiculously modern in the role (he's a dead ringer for Robert Pattison), and Vanessa Kirby as Estella is rather bland. Estella makes for a fascinating character in the book, so much so that you often find yourself wishing that *she* was the main character, and is a gift to any actress, whether they choose to play her as an ice-queen or a vulnerable girl-child. Kirby simply isn't given enough time or material to present Estella as anything other than a rather lost-looking doll. Harry Lloyd as Herbert Pocket and Shaun Dooley as Joe Gargery bring some much needed levity to the proceedings, and David Suchet makes for a striking Jaggers (though it's funny to hear him without the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poirot/dp/B004WMOSNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poirot</a>&nbsp;accent!)

But any viewer settling down to watch ""Great Expectations"" will naturally be most interested in its two most memorable characters: Magwich and Miss Havisham. Ray Winstone puts on an admirable show as Magwich, showing his affection for Pip without losing the inherent threat of violence that he poses to those around him, and Gillian Anderson has a unique take on Miss Havisham. It was with interest that I noticed some complaints that she was too young to play the role, when in actuality, Dickens is never clear on Miss Havisham's exact age. Because of her circumstances, many can't help but picture Miss Havisham as an elderly woman, when in fact her contemporary Compeyson is described in the text as a relatively young-looking man - it logically follows that Miss Havisham is too. As such, I wasn't bothered by Anderson's age (in fact, I think it's closer to Dickens's intent than most people realize) and her performance of Havisham as a ghostly, child-like figure with a lisp and a lack of understanding as to what she's really doing is intriguing. There are a few moments of sharp and cunning clarity, such as when she whispers to Estella: ""practice on him..."" or when she looks at Pip with a sort of grotesque fascination, as a cat might look at a mouse before playing with it, but for the most part, one gets the sense that her mind is too undeveloped for her to really be held accountable for her actions. Anderson also adds a habit of scratching or pinching the skin at the back of her hand (scratching to denote agitation, pinching for excitement), suggesting a woman who suffered from some sort of mental affliction long before she was jilted at her wedding. Anderson's take may divide viewers, but I enjoyed the performance, and it's certainly the most memorable part of the production: her bare-footed glide, her gradually degenerating appearance, the way she disappears and reappears like a ghost - it all makes for a great character study.

It strikes me that any retelling of ""Great Expectations"" will either focus on the love story between Pip and Estelle, or the Magwich storyline. Most concentrate on the former, but this one definitely favours Magwich, to the point where (as I mentioned earlier) Estella is given rather short shrift. We learn very little about her, and Miss Havisham's plans for her are never quite spelt out to their devastating conclusion. Once past childhood, it's difficult to understand why Pip is so besotted, and Kirby's low-key performance gives off the sense that she's being played as a young Miss Havisham - already a ghost despite being in the bloom of youth. Expect no cruel or vivacious heartbreaker here; this Estella simply goes through the motions whilst Pip is busy with the more important plot developments elsewhere.

The production can't help but add some gratuitous ""modern"" sensibilities, such as a scene in which Drummond takes Pip to a brothel and mocks him for his virginity, and a scene in which oh-so-oppressed Estella kicks off her shoes and stockings and goes wading in a lake while her chaperone sleeps, and - as is to be expected - these deviations from Dickens's text do the adaptation absolutely no favours.

Yet this is still a fine adaption and I enjoyed it. It moves at a brisk pace, it ticks all the important plot-points, it's well acted by all (even if the leads a tad dull) and it's sensible in focusing on what's important whilst discarding some of the more extraneous bits of Dickens's novel. I was sad to lose some of the supporting cast as well as Dickens's own dialogue (let's face it, no matter how good the adaptation, it'll never hold up to the original novels) but it's ultimately an elegantly filmed and performed bit of entertainment.",1339632000,10,8040,5.504453441295547

4989149,4,B006H3Q7LA,"Everyone I know who likes British costume dramas seemed either beyond excited for this production or had seen it and thought it was as beautiful as it was haunting. Because such accolades came from people whose opinions I may not always agree with but do trust I was really excited to get my hands on this. I had seen two versions prior to this and although I much preferred the newer Masterpiece adaptation of the two, neither one gripped me in the way that so many Dickens productions have. That is primarily the reason I was so anxious to get my hands on this version.

Young Pip only has one protector. Orphaned, the boy lives with his stern sister but her kind-hearted blacksmith husband, Joe (Shaun Dooley) has always been Pip's hero. Following an odd encounter with an escaped convict named Magwitch (Ray Winstone) on a cold Christmas day, Pip's whole world is about to change. Everything he thought he wanted is now nothing but a past. The recluse and mysterious Miss Havisham wishes for a young boy to come once a week as a kind of playmate to her young impetuous adopted daughter. The locals are still intrigued by the wealthy matron whose past has caused her to lock herself away in a dilapidated old estate. Choosing to go, Pip is swept into the strange woman's world. Miss Havisham (Gillian Anderson) is a woman still used to getting what she wants - her home is shrouded in more than dust and shadows as she walks around bare-footed in a ratty old wedding gown. It is young Estella that Pip quickly loses his young heart to. The teenage beauty is nearly as cold as her mother but the nave Pip is drawn into their world to the point of wanting to live it. Assuming Miss Havisham wants to settle money on Pip, his sister couldn't be more thrilled but much to Pip's disappoint after weeks that turned into months of weekly visits, instead the woman pays for his apprenticeship to train in the trade of balcksmith effectively putting an end to his visits with Estella.

Years pass and Pip (Douglas Booth) grows into a fine-looking man with little potential to become a gentleman. Out of nowhere, a well-known London attorney named Jaggers (David Suchet) informs Pip that a mysterious benefactor has settled a large fortune on him. There are stipulations: Including never inquiring who his benefactor is until he reaches his majority but Pip immediately assumes it is Miss Havisham. Being a man now with prospects, Pip leaves for London but is still ensnared in her web - he is pulled back to the house and into the dark secrets surrounding it when Estella (Vanessa Kirby) returns from finishing school in Paris needing an escort... leading Pip to again pine for Estella.

It is hard to know where to begin in a production such as this. The opening frame - and beyond of this mini-series is pure brilliance. It puts every single one of our senses alert. The filming and set creates a dangerous, mysterious scene only intensified set on the dark, dank marsh land with characters whose purpose and intent we do not yet understand. Naturally if one is privy to the book, everyone is not just familiar with the players but who they will become - for me that did not lessen the intrigue even being familiar with the story via film adaptations. The direction and acting were still beyond compare. If you are unfamiliar with the plot, much of this will seem a tad... um... perhaps, crazy but the strange thing about Dickens is that his novels are so complex and mysterious but each always have points, meanings to every motivation. He was truly a brilliant author.

Having seen two prior versions to this one, this is - by far, the best of the lot. Although I've not read the novel (am I the only one who finds the language... difficult?), a 3-hour miniseries is probably cutting a lot of corners but it felt ""complete"" and authentic to its purpose. Pacing comes across as a bit ""off"" or rushed a time or two but then cramming a lengthy, droning novel into a time slot cannot be an easy feat. For that, scripter's deserve slack. One thing production did not skimp on was casting. The acting is brilliant in this movie - particularly from Gillian Anderson. She owns the role of Miss Havisham. The character is a ghostly shell of a woman whose disappointment has been allowed to rule her life - it has manifested into misery at the least and suicidal tendencies at the worse. Her fragile passive-aggressive attitude is a prison of her own making, instead of moving on and ""being happy"" as Pip once tells her she could have been. Her portrayal of the woman is not likely to be beat in the near future - not even the talented Helena Bonham-Carter will be likely surpass her interpretation. Sometimes, when there is one domineering performance, everyone else pales in comparison, that is fortunately not the case here. Everyone holds their own including newcomers Booth and Kirby. He is nave and conceited to be a strong version of Pip while Kirby is appropriately alluring and cold in a two-dimensional act. Each of the performances is unforgettable in their own right.

It is hard to ""like"" any Dickens-esque story because of its themes, and this is not different. It shows how deeply flawed human nature can be - at its worst. It reflects on the sorrows, regrets and tragedies that make life... life. It re-counts the choices that lead to despair and ruin, and leads us to believe that no one is going to be happy because of the choices they have made. Despite having something to live for, Miss Havisham turns her back not just on life but a young girl who could have used love and the affection of a mother instead of the training to become a woman who would grow up to hate men, and consequently be nearly as miserable as the woman who raised her. Despite this being my favorite adaptation of this story, it's not my favorite Dickens film. Anyone who has experienced his works knows each are merely quirky at best but innately depressing and sometimes pure evil lives within the story. Dickens seems in a class that was all his own. Paid by the word, the author wrote characters that strangely nearly always resembled their surnames and were always ""weird"" but curiously loveable - even if his villains were strictly nasty. This production does not have the same ""bite"" as prior movies. There aren't the usual troubling shivers Dickens can sometimes cause and fortunately, for the audience, despite its ending still being ambiguous, and slightly seeming to have been cut short, it will make romantics sigh with pleasure. Not to mention, the costuming is gorgeous and even in some instances, breathtaking. That alone gives this film ""five stars.""

Whatever you think of him or his style, know this: Great Expectations, whether changed from the novel or not is distinctively Dickens. Make no mistake.

It's been years since I've read this novel so I watched this movie without too many opinions on how the story should unfold. I feel like the creators of the film did an adequate job of packing the 3 hours with important thematic elements without overwhelming the average viewer (like me). Gillian Anderson was transformed as a very ghost-like, creepy Miss Haversham. Overall, I thought the cast was great. I thought Pip was almost too good looking, and more pretty than Estella. As a mother of a child who was born with a cleft lip, I always enjoy seeing actors in films who have this physical trait.

4989155,3,B006H3Q7LA,"Approximately twenty adaptations for film and the theater have been made of Charles Dickens' fictional novel GREAT EXPECTATIONS. I have not read the novel, but I have seen the 1998 film with screenplay by Mitch Glazer that is set on Florida's Gulf Coast and in the 1980's SoHo art world several times. And I watched this 2012 PBS period drama with its more traditional British setting just recently. Both productions follow the general plot of the novel. Although many characters have been omitted in both versions-more in the film, the story remains as a timeless tale, a love story between a young man of modest circumstance who falls for a rich and coldhearted girl. Both versions have a crumbling large house, an eccentric jilted bride...an inspiring success story, and an improbable warm-hearted convict...

At its core, the plot of GREAT EXPECTATIONS is fairly simple. While roaming the countryside, Pip, an orphan of about seven who lives with his abusive sister and her husband, encounters an escaped convict who scares him into stealing food for him and a file to grind away his shackles. The next day the convict is captured. A neighbor, Miss Havisham, a wealthy spinster jilted at the altar, asks Pip's uncle to find a boy to play with her adopted daughter Estella. Pip begins to visit Miss Havisham and Estella, with whom he falls in love. Some years later, Pip, as a young apprentice in his uncle's business, is approached by a lawyer who tells him he is to receive a large sum of money from an anonymous benefactor. Pip believes Miss Havisham to be his benefactress and visits her and Estella, who has returned from studying on the Continent. Then he leaves for the big city to spend his inheritance and lead a grand lifestyle. While in the big city, Pip meets his benefactor and encounters his true love Estella married to another man.

Dickens wrote two endings for his story. Both these adaptations have the happier second ending.

As a timeless love story, I liked the modern version, the 1998 film, better...the actors especially and isn't that the crux...great performance? Since I didn't read the book, I didn't miss the characters that were not in either adaptation.  Here's some comparison of character and setting:

MISS HAVISHAM: Everything I've read says that Miss H. had been jilted at the altar several years before the time of the story. So Gillian Anderson is not too young for the role...although I didn't care for her fey, weird and often spooky rendition.  Anne Bancroft plays Miss H. as eccentric, slightly mad, yet she danced amid the ruins of her palazzo in beautiful flowing costumes. Bancroft was the wondrous age of 67 when she played Miss H. and is absolutely stunning in her madness.
PIP AND ESTELLA: Ethan Hawke is handsome and really shines as Pip in the film - he's highly underrated as an actor. Pip in the traditional production is too much of a pretty boy. But the British actress is a better Estella than Gwyneth Paltrow...an all American girl, lovely to look at...but hard to imagine coldhearted (There's something inherently cold in a trained British accent).
UNCLE JOE: Chris Cooper had won no acting awards when he portrayed Uncle Joe in the 1998 film...but he gives a stellar performance. And his character is a widower...Pip's sister was a grim, bitter woman, and the film did not suffer for lack of her appearance.
THE CONVICT: Both Ray Winstone and Robert deNiro were very good in this role. The PBS production did drag a bit with too much of his escape and capture... Having an actor of deNiro's reputation play a cameo role in the film was a pleasant surprise.
THE LAWYER: David Suchet gave another great PBS performance...he has such a magnificent voice. The lawyer in the film had an understated role with few scenes so the whole bit about Estella's parentage was lost in the updated version.
SETTING: The 1998 film shows Miss Havisham's crumbling, but light and airy, mansion as a vast Italian palazzo in coastal marshes with a symbolic water fountain. Satis House in the novel is a massive place...and its construction as a dark, old house in the PBS production was fascinating. (Read about it at the PBS website.)

4989156,5,B006H3Q7LA,"In remembering Helena Boham Carter's portrayal of the witchy Miss Havisham--after all she has had her share of such roles on the big screen and stage--I was anxious with anticipation to see how an American, turned Queen of Dickens, could handle such a role played previously by some of the best character actress in the business.  It would be a daunting task at best but one I know Gillian Anderson lavished in bringing Miss Havisham to life in her own way.  Fortunate to have seen Gillian on stage in London on several occasions I have come to see for myself how her singular ability can carry everything. Gillian's portrayal of Miss Havisham did not disappoint my ""Great Expectations"" of this character and the twist the story takes to her deathly demise.  Although not utilizing the tongue of Dickens this edition presented itself within a more modern disposition that allowed individuals to relate to a storyline that has no age.  To see just how well it was handled I put it to the test of my itchy seniors awaiting the bell on the day prior to Spring Break.  The opening title of Great Expectations came with an, ""You've got to be kidding me"", so I just kept quiet and let it run.  Slowly, when a tiny white figure slithered down the staircase in an enchanting environment of disarray and cobwebs eyes peeked up.  Try hard they did, not to watch, Gillian's interpretation along with the young adult Pip was just too much for them.  They were watching Dickens when they thought I was not looking hiding behind the computer screen from which the video was streaming! They were drawn into something that was not their usual or desired fare?  What better critique of a presentation can there be?  Well done! Learning comes in some unexpected ways as does the quality of this presentation of Dickens.",1334188800,,1801,4.707006369426751
4989157,3,B006H3Q7LA,"Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful production; the acting is superb, the atmosphere is spot-on.  However, I was a bit disappointed (overall) in this retelling of Charles Dickens' masterpiece.  Great Expectations is one of my all-time favorite novels and I know most of it by heart.  That said, I am fully aware that certain changes/revisions/deletions are necessary when making a book into a film - there is no way to fit all the details in the book into a 3-hour production.  Furthermore, many scenarios in the book cannot be properly conveyed in a film; I get all that.  I just can't come to terms with the fact that several characters (Matthew Pocket, Biddy, Mr. Wopsle) have been deleted from the original story, and why certain scenes or story lines have been either completely changed (i.e. Mr. Wemmick and Pip's relationship) or added (i.e. the brothel scene).  I suppose it doesn't really matter.  All in all, the gist of the story is ultimately conveyed.  Just know that it's certainly not ""Great Expectations by Charles Dickens.""  It should actually be labeled as a story ""inspired by"" Great Expectations, or rather, a ""re-imagining"" of the original story.",1334188800,,1171,4.933673469387755
4989158,5,B006H3Q7LA,"I really enjoyed this production, particularly Gillian Anderson's Miss Havisham. Watching her gradually unravel was amazing. While the first 60 minutes does lacks ""action,"" it has to in order to set the stage -- introducing the characters, creating the atmosphere. It is the 2nd half that really wow'd me. I'm not sure what the negative reviewers were expecting, but I enjoyed it very much. I also loved Douglas Booth as Pip -- I thought his acting was gentle and affecting, and appropriate for the character.

I was going to wait to purchase this, but the price is too good to pass up.",1334188800,,586,4.745098039215686
4989159,1,B006H3Q7LA,"Just blah. I only watched the first episode; after reading the synopsis for the second, I was horrified at some of the changes they made. The first installment was just dull, since they left out most of the ""good stuff."" I can live with dull. What I can't live with is when they take out the good stuff and replace it with ""sensational"" or, in other words, inappropriate, junk.

The book is my favourite Dickens novel, and I have practically memorized it. I'm hoping the film version to be released later this year is better (although what the book really needs is the same five hour-long, lavish, detailed attention A&E's Pride and Prejudice received).

In short, I would definitely NOT recommend this.",1334102400,15,703,4.754098360655738

8498086,4,B006H3Q7LA,"I recently re-read Great Expectations and this adaptation is a departure from the book in small points but, for the most part, keeps close to the meat of the story.  One of my favorite characters in the book, the cheerful and supportive, Biddy, was nowhere in this adaptation.  As a writer myself, I can understand that you cannot include everything in a novel in a film, or in this case, a miniseries. The actors were good, especially Gillian Anderson who is wonderful as Miss Havisham.",1528588800,,487,4.7176470588235295
