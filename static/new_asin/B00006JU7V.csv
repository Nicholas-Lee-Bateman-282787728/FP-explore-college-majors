1782370,1,B00006JU7V,"P>...Jackass' ""creative masterminds"" of Johnny Knoxville and company are really just one step below carnvial geeks... The crew of Jackass, which includes independant film darling Spike Jonze (real name Adam Speigal), just turn the cameras on and act as idiotic as humanly possible.
Between the so-called ""stunts"" there are a few comedy bits, all of which seemed like they were ripped off from other sources. Namely from the Howard Stern Show, The Man Show and the U.K.'s Trigger Happy TV... When bits are conceived by the Man Show or Stern there's a creative process that goes on behind the scenes. One thing that Howard Stern has always strived for is originality...Then it's no longer original or creative. It's just stupidity. Worse, it's not even funny!! Between the stunts and the comedy sketches the viewer is also treated to vast doses of ""Whoa dude!"", ""Hey man!"" and other so-called ""hip"" lingo. I didn't know what was harder to take, the idiotic stunts or the inane prattle...
P.T. Barnum once said ""There's a sucker born every minute"". The difference between someone like Barnum is that when he swindled you at least his machinations were brilliantly concieved and well planned. Jackass is neither. It is offensive and an insult to call this piece trash ""comedy"". It is neither entertaining or funny. It's just plain stupid.",1040860800,,1334,5.013513513513513
1782371,2,B00006JU7V,"Don't bother with this set.  Seriously, this is a cheap, rushed attempt to cash in on the success of the movie with nothing to offer. Each 'volume' is merely a questionably selected 'greatest hits' - pathetic considering each 8-9 episode 'season' could fit comfortably on 2 discs.  All the censoring remains intact and the music has been altered for many segments (generally for the worst). There's also ZERO previously unseen footage (nothing from the infamous 'Too Hot for MTV'), and there are essentially no extras.  The lack of a simple running commentary track like the one featured on Steve-O's 1st Don't Try this at Home release is just ridiculous; that could have at least given these releases some purpose.
I fully expect to see uncensored, complete releases of each season within a year or two; the controversy will have died down by then and given the popularity of the movie and these mediocre collections MTV will try to milk the property as much as possible.  Until then, pick up the Steve-O videos or the CKY Box set in lieu of this junk.",1040688000,,1053,4.769230769230769
1782372,5,B00006JU7V,"The recent release of this hit television series on DVD has had me in laughter, viewed in high quality video.
Each DVD is PACKED with skits/pranks/stunts from the show so it is definately worth the $ you pay for it.
The reason why Volume 1 has not been released is because of legal issues surrounding several skits from the show in the first series. This relates to lawsuits from the families of children (filed against MTV), from the children attempting to perform the stunts contained in the show. It is clearly defined in the show that none of the stunts should be attempted or performed. The remainder of the responsibility is not MTV's --but to the parents of the children, who should have been watching their kids more closely.
The DVDs' are awesome -- buy them, and you'll thank yourself later.",1040083200,,801,4.6879432624113475
1782373,3,B00006JU7V,"If your looking for unedited Jackass this isn't it. All the cussing is still censored. They even change alot of the music they use on certain skits. Probably because of royalty issues. When I buy a DVD I don't want all the good stuff to be cut out,and  everything is cut out. MTV should have put out two versions like there doing for The Osbournes,because this one isn't what I expected. But if you want uncensored Jackass wait for the movie to be realesed on DVD or get something from the CKY series, because this is the same as watching it on TV.",1039737600,,548,4.320388349514563

Well now i find out that they are still bleeped! theres nothing i can do now, they're bought and paid for, and im still glad i have them but it should have been stated somewhere that they would still be censored.  Also, there is NO added or unaired footage.  Everything on here was on tv. If you don't mind the beeps, then they are still awesome! and a final comment for the 2 who say otherwise, volume one will NOT be released next year or anytime for that matter, INSTEAD there are supposed to be full UNCENSORED seasons coming to dvd once the legal situation is solved, key word there ""SUPPOSED"".",1039564800,21,943,4.535294117647059

1782377,5,B00006JU7V,"I just went to my local Best Buy to pick up this DVD to see if it was worth my 30 bucks. Let me tell you it is worth every penny and then some. This is the best stocking stuffer you could give to somebody who is interested in this kind of funny, prank stuff.
I saw the movie and have nearly every episode d/l on my computer, but I was waiting for them all to come out on DVD quality. This does not dissapoint, with super clear picture, great sound....it just doesn't get any better.
Yes, not every stunt from the seasons is on these DVDs, but that's okay because they focus on the BEST ones. I guarantee you you will laugh so hard it will make your eyes water. I know in my case that these DVDs will be in my DVD player for a while, because it's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again with your buds. If you like CKY or any other funny stupid movie then this will crack you up.
For the technical aspect of it, there is GREAT picture and sound, very clear and vibrant and there are a lot of extras on it to (Trivia Game and more). For those of you who love the series but don't love the swearing, don't worry the cuss words and nudity is beeped and blanked out.

1782394,5,B00006JU7V,"JACKASS VOL.1

I was just sitting there bored the other night and was wondering what should watch, I was only one home with nothing to do on a day off. So there I was looking at my collection wondering what have not watched since I bought it, and there it was. It had been a while since I had seen any thing Jackass related, and I used to watch this stuff all the time. I realized just how much I missed this how once I finished viewing it; I wish these guys would get together one last time before they are too old.

Any way there are a lot of funny things on this DVD and some that are just ok. But I learned one thing about viewing this alone, it is much funnier when you watch any of this with your friends. Maybe it is just the atmosphere that is created when there are a lot of people watching some stupid stuff. Also I have to say that the second half in my opinion is better then most of the first off, still it is all good if you are bored. None the less there are a lot of really good moments and not surprising a lot feature Bam, Dico, Ryan, and the CKY crew. Things such as the BMX Joust, and the classic Shopping Carts segment, of course all of them have good moments [Preston's pee gag is great, those people acted so cool to his face and then clowned him once he left]. I feel like this is a little hard to review due to the fact that it is a collection of season 1 and the full season. I guess over everything else the best thing about this release is the hilarious commentary that the guys provide; in fact it makes the show that much better. These guys are a lively bunch and that shows even more just listening to these guys make fun of them selves and each other. They rip on Ehren bad on this track, so much so that you feel bad for him.

I think over all this with out the commentary would get a rating of 4, with it gets a 5. After viewing this twice once with the commentary I think I might have to watch all Jackass related things all week long, yeah that sounds good.",1221177600,3,1993,4.015113350125945

Yes, it is a sick and twisted show!  It is called Jackass for Pete's sake!  It's a bunch of guys acting like idiots!  But you know what?  I love to watch it!  So, if you are buying this... know that what it is... a bunch of guys doing stupid, yet hilarious, stunts (that you shouldn't do at home!).

1782400,3,B00006JU7V,"and the so-called ""uncensored"" commentary which in theory spans the first 59 sketches is so heavily censored and bleeped that it is almost unlistenable.  I suspect it is censored for legal rather than language reasons as it seemed that they were talking about private matters or people who were not there.

Still calling the commentary ""uncensored"" is a lie.",1167868800,2,358,5.0508474576271185
1782410,1,B00006JU7V,"I gave this movie one star because it is stupid and sick. When they say that it's unrated it's true, they show the guys in the movie butt naked, thowing up, and more. Now I will admit there are some very funny parts in this movie but I would NOT suggest that you get this and watch it with kids in the room younger than 17.

Pros: It can be very funny at times. There are 4 or 5 parts in the movie that will make you laugh.

Cons: There is a lot of cussing, guys butt naked,& doing thing's that should be kept private.

All in all if you have t see this movie go out and rent it don't buy first off.",1167264000,,599,3.814516129032258
1782411,5,B00006JU7V,"I think that this season was better than 2 and 3 because it was still the beginning and MTV hadn't started to destroy it by cutting down scenes. This probably explains why this volume hasn't been released until now but it was worth the wait. This set contains so many prime moments of Jackass including The Goldfish, Bam and Brandon's BMX joust, Dave's bicycle rides, and so many more.

Jackass is one o=f the funniest shows to ever be on television and you wonder to yourself how any of these people can actually do the stuff that they do. The low budget cameras also give the show a home-video feel which is pretty funny. Johnny Knoxville is great in this and you'll end up laughing again and again if you buy volume one.

Some of the Highlights Include:

Poo Cocktail

Daddy and Baby 2

BMX Joust

The Goldfish

Extreme Pogo

Mexican Snowboarding

Overall this is a great buy and it will provide you with hours of entertainment. Lots of fun from Johnny Knoxville, Stevo-O, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Chris Pontius, and the rest of the gang. It's makes you wonder how MTV",1135728000,2,1070,4.53125

1782414,4,B00006JU7V,"Where is the ""SELF-DEFENSE PRODUCTS DEMONSTRATION""?

That's the one in which Johnny Knoxville subjects himself to pepper spray, an electrified cattle prod and taser darts.  That's the first ""Jackass"" sketch I saw and it's hilarious, still one of my favorites.

When Vol. 2-3 came out, I was hoping it would be on one of those.

It wasn't.

So, I thought, surely it'll be on Vol. 1.

It's not.

Still, there are over 100 chapters here and some really good sketches:

""Poo Cocktail,"" ""Johnny Coxville,"" ""BMX Joust,"" ""Sumo Wrestling,"" ""Daddy and Baby (1-3),"" ""The Goldfish,"" ""50 Egg Challenge,"" ""Egg Nog Challenge,"" ""Landskiing"" (with Bam Margera doing one of the best falls of the series); ""Beekini,"" ""Bam Beating Phil for a Day,"" ""Prostitute Boat Race,"" ""Skunk,"" ""Steve-O Shot Glass"" and the extremely funny ""Oklahoma,"" in which Preston gets whipped by dominatrices.

2) No special features whatsoever.

3) This is not seasons 2 and 3 of the show. It is a compilation of so-called ""greatest Jackass moments"".

4) Some of the funniest skits/stunts are cut out, and in some of the skits the original songs have been changed to something else.

5) Just to avoid any confusion, there is no ""Volume 1"".

I guess if you have no other way to watch Jackass, this would have to do. But for a true fan of the show, this is so disappointing. Even the Jackass guys have said in interviews that this DVD set sucks, and that MTV sucks.

The only thing you gain from buying this over just taping it off TV is no commerical interruptions. Other than that it is just like watching the show on TV, only with many of your favorite stunts cut out, and some of your favorite songs replaced!

The first season is not available for purchase. Instead, buy CKY Landspeed...aside from a few Knoxville skits, that's basically all the first season was.
Each disc is over an hour long and contains a fairy nice menu set-up: crosshairs appear over a skit and when you click on them, it plays a short clip of some sort of painful action before moving to the selected menu. Bonus features include a trivia game (you'll have to pay attention to the entire DVD if you want to pass it, and each disc has different questions), photo gallery and a mildly interesting cast biography page. Check out Knoxville's real name...hah!
Season 2 contains memorable stunts such as Knoxville's 'Cup Test', The 'Snake River BMX Jump', 'American Werewolf (In London)', Steve-O's infamous 'Butt Piercing', the CKY crew's 'Bucket Cars', Steveo versus Dunn in 'Stilt Boxing', and last but not least Steve-O's .Bobbing for Jellyfish'.
Season 3's assortment of stunts include: the bizarre 'Spermathon' (in which members of the Jackass crew visit a sperm bank and test various things...you'll just have to see), 'Office Chairs', Ryan Dunn's 'Stupid Idea Rolling Down a Hill', the stomach turning 'Omlette', and Chris Pontius's outrageous Playgirl audition...

Sure- it's one of those guilty pleasures- grown men engaging in self mutilation, painful stunts, bodily functions, and so much more. With classics like the Spermathon, Accidental Poo, Poo Diaper, the Bikini Wax, and the stomach lurching ""The Omelette""- okay- I never said anything about good taste, especially seeing Steve-O getting his Buttcheeks pierced together- squirming around in your seat in discomfort was never this much fun!
Sadly, though the DVD's are marked with the everpopular ""Parental Advisory"" sticker- you won't see or hear anything you didn't see on TV- so if you want language, and some full frontal nudity, you'll have to stick to your ""Girls Gone Wild"" and porn- but it's still full of best of the evertasteless Jackass cast.",1045785600,,926,5.0588235294117645
1782429,5,B00006JU7V,"If you're not a fan of Jackass already, then chances are, this is definitely NOT going to make you like the concept any better. It's stupid humor, it's skateboarding and other stunts, it's candid camera jokes -- and someone like myself,well, I'm surprised that I love it as much as I do.
Overall, if you want to buy only ONE of the DVD's, I would suggest Vol. 2, but Vol. 3 is great too. Some highlights on the DVD's include Bam going after his dad (repeatedly), Antiquing, Dave England and ""The Omelette"", Jai Alai,and Fat F*ck 2. As a fan, I couldn't be happier, but I JUST WISH THAT THE DVD'S WERE NOT CENSORED.",1044576000,,614,4.394736842105263
1782430,3,B00006JU7V,"Okay, not only is this DVD lacking some of the better skits (any of the CKY stuff with Bam and Phil, the egg-eating contest, etc) they included some of the lamer skits like the metallic suit, beard of leeches, and Gumball 2000.  Seriously lacking and let's not mention the edited scenes, this DVD was promised to show ""what MTV wouldn't allow on air"".  The only skit I hadn't seen on MTV was the omelette, or should I say Vomelette.  All in all, still entertaining, but a real big let-down for this Jackass fan.  Buy the CKY box set instead!",1043971200,4,541,4.434343434343434
1782431,4,B00006JU7V,"The Jackass dvd set featuring season 2 and 3 was very good.  I didn't see the skits before so they were very good. I hadn't seen the Jackass show before just the Movie and I wish i did see the show when it was on the air.  Some skits you will recognize from the cKy films but most of it is from Jackass.  It is hysterical, not as good as the movie but funny.  WARNING to those with a weak stomach: some skits are very gross like the omellete and the worm skit with Steve-O. My dad almost threw up. The only thing i am disapointed with is that it says PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT CONTENT but the profanity are bleeped out. It is edited just like the Tv show.  I thought from reading the back of the box that it is an option to bleep the bad out. So for the worried moms out there these movies are just like what you would see on MTV. The only thing bad that could possibly be EXPLICIT is that a few of the backround songs have some uncensored words in them. Not a big thing to worry about though.  EXCELLENT PURCHASE FOR a DVD.",1041811200,,1025,4.0495049504950495
1782432,5,B00006JU7V,"Why not double the dose of the pain, cringing, and insanity?  Well, with this 2 pack, you get the chance to do so.  If you choose to go with the two pack, you get volumes 2 and 3.  Get ready for some cringing.... and prepare to laugh like hell!
JACKASS VOL. 2:
Finally, Jackass has come out on DVD. Although there is no Vol. 1 right now, (I don't even know if there really is a Vol. 1 or if it's just supposed to be a joke), Vol. 2 is still a great collection of some of the most outrageous, disgusting, shocking, and disturbing moments from the very popular TV show. Join Johnny Knoxville and his gang of misfits as they do some of the most idiotic things ever to be caught on tape. (But it's hilarious!)
With this collection you'll see stuff like this: The cup test, plunger wake up, the worm trick, bucket cars, red wagon, bikini wax, ice blocking, lawn trap, human bulls-eye, punt return, and many, many more wackiness and chaos.
The DVD has very few special features, but that's okay. All I wanted was the show itself. The features included are a trivia game, photo gallery, and cast bios. Yes, the swears and bleeped out and nude people are blurred out. (Funny how they will censor the swearing from the guys themselves when the music playing in the background is uncensored. Interesting.)
You'll laugh, you'll cringe.... you'll want to hurl after seeing some of the things you will witness. (One I couldn't even watch. I had to skip it. Try to figure out which one it is when you watch it.) ""Jackass: Volume 2"" is Jackass at its best.
Kids, don't try this at home. I'm sick of all the parents and news complaining about the show because some stupid and brainless moron decided to reenact some of the stunts. Watch it, don't live it. Okay? Okay.
JACKASS VOL. 3:
Yes kiddies, if Volume 2 wasn't enough for you, ""Jackass: Volume 3"" is here to give you more laughs, more cringes, more sickness, and more pain. Some people think the show is utterly stupid and pointless. Yeah.... and the problem is? That's why it's so funny.
This isn't for people with weak stomachs. A lot of the things you're going to see on this DVD are going to make you sick and cringe a lot... but you'll be laughing like hell if you're a sick and twisted S.O.B. like me!
When you purchase Volume 3, expect to see this: Bounty hunter, beard of leeches, full pipe skating, bottle skating, hot dog skate boarding, security guard, nutball, spermathon, fat ---- #2, and much, much more. Once again, nakedness is blurred (not really a bad thing if you ask me) and cuss words are bleeped. Still I do not know why they feel that the actual swearing has to be bleeped out and yet swears in the background music can still be left in. Oh well.
And again, no spectacular special features included, but it's the 77 minutes of hilarity and madness of the actual show that counts. The few features included are things like a trivia game, photo gallery, and cast bios.
So if you think you can take another dose of Jackass, then by all means pick up ""Jackass: Volume 3."" While it may not be as good as Volume 2, it is still a very worthy purchase. Be prepared to laugh, cringe, and be disgusted. All that fun stuff, right? I thought you'd agree with me.
Kids, don't try this at home. Until you are an actual member of the official show, just stick to watching so I don't have to hear parents and the news complain about how terrible of a show it is. All right? Think you can do that? Great. Thank you.",1041379200,2,3460,4.394695787831513
1782433,4,B00006JU7V,"Alot of the great skits are on here, even though as others reported, they are censored and have some shortened segments and changed music. Still, it's a good solid chunk of low brow entertainment. Extras are pretty minimal, and there's the ""trivia game"" addition is a questionable and bizarre special feature.
Still, due to the controversy surrounding the series, it's doubtful MTV will ever release a ""complete Season xx Box Set"" and airings of the original episodes on that network are rare. Until the Jackass Movie DVD comes out, this is as close as you are going to get to seeing any of the weird, disgusting, freakish, humiliating, and sometimes even amazing stunts.
Each disk is well over an hour long, and each have only a few true gross-out segments, something I never particular cared for in the original series. They're great to put on during a party and just let play in the background.",1041206400,,897,4.7935483870967746

1782435,3,B00006JU7V,"I don't know about anyone else, but this was possibly the most eagerly awaited DVD of the year, well for me, anyway.
 Whilst I love Jackass and can watch most of it anytime without getting bored, I was really looking forward to owning this DVD.
 But it is dissapointing, it's a bit of a let down for me, The 'bleeps' which cover swearing are still intact, and the fuzzy screen whenever there is nudity and [stuff] remains too, Now I don't really want to see male nudity, but I want the full picture, a chunk of the soundtrack has gone too, which dissapoints as some skits were really complete with the music.
I love the show and all the 'guys' from it, but I may aswell have taped it from MTV... its no different.
 Also the volume one is missing, because of stupid kids copying it and lawsuits etc. I still rate the DVD because I rate the show, I can't wait for the movie, but I long for a complete collection with extras etc, in a nice deluxe boxset, like the cKY series.",1041120000,14,972,4.271739130434782
