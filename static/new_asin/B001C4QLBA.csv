3505757,5,B001C4QLBA,I can't recommend this wonderful travel series through the US enough. What a fantastic and touching journey Mr Fry takes us on through one of the world's most exciting and interesring countries. His access to some truly amazing people and places is a joy to behold. Fantastic television that only a Brit of the talent of Stephen Fry could pull off. Come down to Australia now Stephen - have we got some stories for you!,1285113600,18,419,4.6
3505758,5,B001C4QLBA,"This couldn't be a more perfect vehicle for showcasing the talents of the multifaceted Stephen Fry.  Fry is such a fascinating person in his own right that his playing fictional characters often deprives the audience of his best asset, his real self.  That is on showcase here as Fry takes on a journey through the United States in a British taxicab.  His choices for stopping points are all his own and showcase his own wide ranging interests.  Unlike most documentary fare, this plays as if you are along on a personal odyssey with Stephen Fry and, as his friend, he is relating conversationally to you his thoughts and ideas about America as you travel to and around various points.  His choices for stopping points are all as unique as himself.  I wish Fry would do more of this kind of show rather than playing fictional characters such as Peter Kingdom and a PR man (as he did in another BBC series).  He was best in fictional roles as Jeeves and Oscar Wilde but those kinds of parts come once in a blue moon.  I can't recommend this show strongly enough.

3505759,5,B001C4QLBA,"I have just spent the last six hours watch a very personable (and quite funny) British television personality show me parts of America that I never knew existed. It sometime takes a person from overseas to show us things about ourselves and our culture (and our beautiful natural resources!) that we are too close to see.

Stephen Fry explains, in the first few minutes of this FABULOUS six-part BBC series, that he was almost born in Princeton, NJ where his father lived for a while. He's always had a fascination with the US and so in 2008 he brought a real British taxicab here and drove to every one of the 50 states. (Well, that's what he says he did. In reality he covered 51, because the District of Columbia - where he stopped  - is not a ""state"", and he had to leave the taxi in Washington State and fly to both Alaska and Hawaii.. But who's griping? Not me! I don't know how long it took to film this journey but it was obviously 6 months or more. And I give lots of credit to the photographer and Directors John Paul Davidson and Michael Waldman, who are there capturing the beauty - as well as some eccentrics.

The show aired on the BBC and was aimed at UK audiences so you'll hear a few curse words once in a while. And the section on Nevada visits the famous ""Mustang Ranch"" (where prostitution is legal) and parents may not want to share those moments with young children. But the rest makes great family viewing.

The six hour-long episodes cover a different region. Fry starts in Maine and heads south. From the Deep South he heads to the Mississippi River and follows it all the way from Louisiana (visit to New Orleans after Katrina and to Angola State Penitentiary) to Michigan (Detroit auto industry). Then, the great Mountain States, The Southwest and finally, The Pacific. He visits famous tourist places of course but he gets to places you'd never see on your own. In Knoxville, TN there is a real ""body farm"". In Miami he visits a Senior Housing compound where he meets ""senior male escorts"". (The ratio is 10 women to one man!. He visits Kent State and discusses the massacre there, and in Chicago he gets a tour with blues man Buddy Guy.. The ""Mountains and Plains"" section includes a great interview with Ted Turner - who is America's largest private land owner - on one of his ranches and Fry joins him for a buffalo dinner. I really could go on and on about the highlights but that will destroy the fun!  Okay, a few states are just ""drive thru"" moments and Fry confuses the State of Delaware with the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania when he crosses on the Cape May (NJ) to Lewes (Del) ferry and says that George Washington ""crossed the Delaware here in 1776"".

Within minutes of the start you can't help but like Fry and bond with him. At the beginning of Episode Three we find him wearing an arm cast (!) but he never explains why its there and by the next few states, it's gone. And he does ask insightful questions of the people he visits.

I can't recommend this set highly enough! I've even found a few new states I want to visit. This was a massive project to produce and I, for one, am glad that Fry allows all of us to join him on his journey!

3505760,5,B001C4QLBA,"Anyone who is a fan of Stephen Fry will absolutely love his DVDs entitled Stephen Fry in America.  In this TV series, which was first broadcast on the BBC in the UK, Stephen travels through all fifty states in America.  He goes from New England, down South, to Florida, and then all the way up the Mississippi to the frozen North.  On and on through all 50 states.

In England he drives a London taxi cab to maintain some anonymity, so that is what he uses in this BBC series to drive all over America.  This particular London cab was hired in America, but it is still neat.

In May 2009 the two-DVD set is already being sold in England, but unfortunately it is not playable on an American format DVD player.  The American format DVDs are now available for pre-order on Amazon.com and will be shipped on September 1, 2009.  Since I lived in Europe for so many years I have a lot of European format DVDs, and I also own a couple of European type DVD players that I can watch this on.  I bought my copy from Amazon.co.

3505762,5,B001C4QLBA,"I ran across the listing for this on Amazon UK, & immediately snapped it up(along with ""Robbie Coltrane's B-Road Britain"" aka&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robbie-Coltrane-Incredible-Britain/dp/B00180IPQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robbie Coltrane - Incredible Britain</a>). This would be perfect to be shown on PBS, but BBCAmerica will probably show it, wedged amongst the tabloid & ""reality"" TV that channel7 seems to have become infested with, and have more terrible commercials than program, and PBS will show more Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, & Susan Powter infommercials instead of the type of programming that made its name.
 But this program was exactly what I expected, with Fry's wry & dry commentary, letting us come along as he crosses the US, in a left-hand drive London-style taxi. What I didn't expect was that he would actually bad-mouth certain places, the most glaring of which must remain nameless....but there was a TV show about it in the 80's with a couple of dicks named Tubbs & Crockett. Usually travel programs are all sweetness & light, but we see quite a few American warts. When visiting St. Louis, we see the Arch: it's never mentioned, but instead Fry spends the segment with a group of homeless...actually they're not homeless- home is an abandoned factory.
 Far too much time was spent in Las Vegas, but I guess Mr Fry can be excused: his time was spent with Chippendale dancers & at a Mormon men beefcake calendar shoot, and if I was going to send someone I like to Colorado, I certainly wouldn't send them to Aspen. Could have been worse, though, he could have gone to Vail. And unfortunately, it wasn't raining in Seattle, which is one cause he never mentioned when discussing the Jet City's high suicide rate.
 Like Bill Bryson and Michael Palin, Stephen Fry doesn't take himself too seriously, although he does show off his erudition while at the Mormon men shoot, and the man he's talking to basically says ""I have no idea what you just said.""
 The fact this is soon to be available in the US is a good omen. Hopefully Fry's QI TV show may become available. That's a great show, but not stupid enough to be cloned by the powers who run American TV. QI is Quite Interesting, but for right now is just available out of the UK in Region 2 format, or a few clips on YouTube, but if you enjoy Stephen Fry, I highly recommend this, as well as his podcast.",1240531200,2,2430,4.93398533007335
3505763,5,B001C4QLBA,"I often put this on in the background, just because Stephen Fry is a such a soothing storyteller. But don't just listen, the cinematography on this blu-ray is gorgeous, as he explores both famous and overlooked places throughout the USA. Fry doesn't want this to be a simply a picturesque travelogue, though. Some of his unusual stops include Angloa State Prison in Louisiana, exploring Wiccan and Voodoo culture in Salem, Mass. and New Orleans, a body farm at the University Of Tennessee, hanging out with Ted Turner at his massive bison ranch in Montana, and watching border police work the USA/Mexico border. Attending a stunningly produced college football game at Auburn - complete with a fly over by jets - he finds all of America can be summed up right here: ""Expensive, overpopulated, ridiculous, charming, beautiful, uniquely America.""",1445731200,,844,5.1231884057971016

3505770,4,B001C4QLBA,"Stephen Fry, a man so British that he's actually been used before as an example of a steriotypical Brit, tries to get the pulse of each individual American state (except Ohio, alas). Don't look for comedy routines here, this is a mostly serious documentary and is only intermittently funny (like a trip to a whisky factory). However, to compensate, it is quite interesting and often decidedly non-touristy, with Fry wandering into (among many other things) a southern prison, a brothel, a firepit for homeless guys in freezing weather, and a human body farm used in CSI research. It's pretty breathtaking overall to see just how huge and how varied America can be.
If I have a quibble, it's that this should have been at least four DVDs, not two. I realize it was made for British television, but I wish they would release this as an extended version. Covering almost all fifty states in two DVDs sometimes makes it feel rushed. I could have used a lot more coverage in some areas; Fry is extremely interesting to watch no matter what he is doing.
By the way, he wrote a companion book that I highly recommend; it's not a strict repeat of the documentary but rather goes into some additional details to what is covered in the documentary, and sometimes adds new stuff not even in the DVDs. It is worth buying both.
You can buy this in a format compatible with US DVD players.",1407196800,,1375,4.616326530612245

3505774,4,B001C4QLBA,"This is a six-part series, one hour per episode, in which Stephen Fry visits every state in America, including Alaska and Hawaii. Inevitably, he can't spend long in each state, so really this is less a travel series than a chance to spend time with Mr. Fry. He's a congenial companion, with the ability to find interest in most things he sees. Although he touches on some of the famous sights, his focus is on out-of-the-way spots and unusual people. He, or more likely his crew, do a good job of finding locations and people that hold the attention when interviewed by the engaging Mr. Fry.

Well, except for episode 5. I'm not sure what went wrong there, but in episode 5 he visits only 4 states (New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada) and spends way too much time on rather dull subjects. The Mustang Ranch brothel has been shown many times before and playing a version of the old TV series 'The Mole' in Las Vegas with the Chippendale dancers really wasn't of any interest to anyone but the participants. The Mormon calendar shoot was no better. Had these been small segments in, say, a ten-state episode, then fair enough, but this was the one episode where longer segments were shown and it just wasn't very interesting. I'd have liked to have heard why the series took such a sharp change in direction there (and then went back to its former self in episode 6), but the set has no special features to explain what went into the making of the show.

Four stars for 5 good episodes out of 6. If you want to see Stephen Fry in a 5-star series, check out 'Last Chance To See', filmed at the same time (the cast Fry wears on his arm in one episode of 'In America' was caused by a fall in 'Last Chance'). However, 'Stephen Fry In America' offers the opportunity to travel the US with a great companion. Wouldn't most of us love to do that?",1388361600,,1839,4.421828908554573

3505777,3,B001C4QLBA,"I was excited to see this documentary, but it did not live up to my expectations. I adore Stephen Fry and thought ""Oh, this is going to be hilarious"". It had funny moments, and Mr. Fry did visit a few unusual places, but the whole feeling of this production can be summed up in one word: RUSHED. The BBC would have made a much better documentary if they had devoted more disc space to each state. Maryland didn't even get visited. Mr. Fry was literally on the freeway and said something like ""Oh, we're just passing Maryland, but I don't have time to stop"". So really, he did NOT visit all 50 states. Disappointing.",1376179200,,615,4.4035087719298245
3505778,5,B001C4QLBA,"First off, some people may find his views offensive, and also I must point out that not all States are covered in the show.  In fact in some cases he just kind of drives through them and says some facts about them while doing so.  I ENJOYED the DVD.  Good or bad, it is always good to get another point of view.  Driving in his Black London Taxi, he visits a whiskey distillery, a brothel, the Amish, while trying to find out what makes Americans ...well, Americans.  From eating seafood to visiting a body farm he gets a good, close up of our nation, its people, merits, and flaws.  From food to music, from history to culture, he explores the landscape, examines our traditions, and reviews what he, in the end, thinks about US.
I would suggest it for anybody who loves history, culture, and the US of A!",1368489600,,806,4.375838926174497
3505779,4,B001C4QLBA,"As an American, and Stephen Fry fan, I was intrigued to find out what this series would be like. I was not disappointed. It is one of the most fascinating, beautiful, and heartwarming trips across America that I've ever seen. Fry travels to every state in the Union (some seem to get the shaft) from one adventure to the next. I enjoyed very much that for the most part, he avoids major cities. These places have been covered so many times. Instead, he seems to focus on whatever staple each state is known for. Most Americans wouldn't be surprised by his choices, but for others it may be a learning experience of America's various cultures. In a lot of ways, Each state really is like its own country. There is a Sense of unfairness with the time spent in each state. Some he merely drives through, which leaves you feeling underwhelmed. I suppose it wouldn't be a problem, but some of the states that receive the most attention, are rather unworthy of it. His visit to Las Vegas, for example, was strangely boring and much too long. I have to take a star off for that, because much of the series is so good, being thrown a dud episode is depressing. I've already viewed this series twice, and can't wait to jump in again. What a refreshing and fun vacation, with a wonderful host, that you can take right in your living room. I wish the series would return and give more time to the landscapes and cultures of America.",1359158400,2,1421,4.469230769230769
3505780,1,B001C4QLBA,"The first dvd was entertaining enough. But, the second one (the West) made me begin to question what exactly he was trying to accomplish. Was this intended for a British audience? If so, then they would be left with a very bizarre impression of what it is to be American. He focused almost entirely on oddities, fringe elements, the disenfranchised and the less interesting of our natural wonders. This would be okay if it had been balanced in any way with a few positive elements, or if, as another reviewer mentioned, he showed ANY fondness for America and Americans. At the end, I realized it had left me with a bad taste in my mouth because it felt like this was a person who really didn't like America and wished to have us seen primarily in a less than flattering light. It also gave me a lightbulb moment about the Brits and their culture as Stephen showed us real British cynicism and stuffiness. I don't think he intended to. He just couldn't help being himself. He even used two of his fellow ex-pat Brits (the guy who invented the internet and the designer of the iPad & iPod) to explain to us why they were in the U.S.: America isn't cynical and encourages creativity while Britain is and doesn't.

He spent several minutes of film at the Mustang Ranch brothel while we had to tour with him SEVERAL of the rooms and a lengthy interview with one of the girls (in which he forced her into a position of having to lie about her performance - no pun intended). Several minutes were spent at a photo shoot for a new calendar: Mormon boys! (in clean cut poses) Wow! fascinating! A LOT of time spent in Las Vegas at a team-building exercise with Chippendale dancers. Yawn. Oregon was characterized by a family man who believed he'd seen a Sasquatch and through tears talked about fearing for his family's safety and by a young, idealistic treehugging couple. Stephen was polite to their faces but not behind their backs. A 'highlight' of Seattle was to hear about the heroin problem. (What city doesn't have a drug problem?) His visits with various Native Americans always centered around drawing out conversation about being disenfranchised with little about the beauty of their cultures. In Alaska, he didn't realize that the term ""lower 48"" simply means the 48 states to the south of Alaska. Stephen tried to turn it into a term of derision. He did the same in Hawaii - tried to get the Hawaiian man to talk about being disenfranchised, but the guy said he wasn't.

As for the natural world: We spent several minutes of film with him laying around on a houseboat on Lake Powell while he discussed that it was man-made and this was the reason for the lack of vegetation. It was completely devoid of other boats or life of any kind. I couldn't help but wonder if the symbolism was intentional. No mention or a very BRIEF mention of the gems of America: Yosemite, Yellowstone, Lake Superior, the Grand Canyon, etc. etc.

Fry is as contemplative in this travel series as he was as a butler taking care of a youthful Hugh Laurie.

This is a six episode BBC series, and Fry travels in a British taxi through 48 states (he flies to Alaska and Hawaii).  You'll see him lounging in a hottub on a houseboat on Lake Powell, touring the rooms of the Mustang Ranch, and experiencing a Tennessee Trotter, among other adventures.  I found myself wincing a number of times.  Is this what people in England know about America?  What they want to know?  Did ""we"" put our best foot forward?

Entertaining throughout.  For the British perspective on the world, I also recommend Michael Palin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pole-to-Pole/dp/B000R7I49K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pole to Pole</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Around-the-World-in-80-Days/dp/B000MGBM22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Around the World in 80 Days</a>.",1332201600,4,1394,6.908571428571428
3505789,3,B001C4QLBA,"As a travelogue exploring the States, the show is simply too brief which means a largely superficial experience -- not just for the viewer, but more importantly for Stephen Fry. One sees no arc of development on his part: no deepening perspective, greater insight or growing affection as his journey goes on. The diversity of the US (historically, geographically, culturally, etc.) is really the star of the show and therefore makes for very interesting viewing.

Sadly, Stephen Fry himself is one of the weaker elements of this adventure. Fry reveals himself to be quite the ""little Englander"" in his travels. In San Francisco, he refers to the 2 most renowned British exports to the US (a guy who invented the internet and the lead designer for Apple); Fry then asks the Apple designer from Britain why he thinks he and the internet guy both chose to settle in the US. His response: Because the US is characterized by a LACK of cynicism, and ideas are such fragile things, so this environment is a much better one for a creative person, a designer. That is the most ironic moment in the entire series because the Apple designer inadvertently points to what makes Stephen Fry's televised journey ultimately so unsatisfying.

Everywhere he is met with generosity, kindness and American pride. Yet try as he might, his own cynicism and condescension keeps bursting through. The contrast with travelers like Michael Palin or Joe Cross is huge. I kept wishing for the deep compassion, affection and joy exhibited by Ken Burns' films or as seen in Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead even as Joe Cross interacted with lower class and morbidly obese Americans. At bottom, Fry is an uptight, prissy, judgmental upper-middle-class English snob who can't help using phrases about America as ""vulgar"", ""kitsch"", ""for all its flaws"", ""for good and for evil"", etc. which remain untempered by affection. Watch this for America, not Stephen Fry...",1331510400,13,1922,4.96583850931677

This is perfectly suited to be shown on PBS, but BBCAmerica will probably show it, wedged amongst the tabloid & ""reality"" TV that BBCAmerica has become infested with, and have more terrible commercials than program content. The good news is buying a British DVD means you don't get all the stupid US previews and ads, plus one thing that I love about most Region 2 DVD's: no security seals.
But this program was exactly what I expected, with Fry's wry & dry commentary, letting us come along as he crosses the US, in a left-hand drive English taxi, what most Yanks would call a ""London"" taxi. What I didn't expect was that he would actually bad-mouth certain places, the most glaring of which must remain nameless....but there was a TV show about it in the 80's with a couple of dicks named Tubbs & Crockett. One thing in that city that was fun was that Fry was dragged onto the dance floor, which is the first time I've seen him shake it since he was doing Dancercise on A Bit of Fry and Laurie - Seasons One & Two(""Dancercise is a combination of 'dance' and 'circumcise'""). Usually travel programs are all sweetness & light, but we see quite a few American warts. When visiting St. Louis, we just glimpse the Arch: it's never mentioned, but instead Fry spends the segment with a group of homeless...actually they're not homeless- home is an abandoned factory.
Far, far too much time was spent in Las Vegas, but I guess Mr Fry can be excused: his time was spent doing a ""team-building"" exercise with Chippendale dancers, & at a beefcake calendar shoot featuring Mormon men. And if I was going to send someone I like to Colorado, I certainly wouldn't send them to Aspen. Could have been worse, though, he could have gone to Vail. And unfortunately, it wasn't raining in Seattle, which is one cause he never mentioned when discussing the Jet City's high suicide rate.(Seattle is not #1 in suicides any longer....the city at the beginning of this paragraph is. Small wonder.)
Like Bill Bryson and Michael Palin, Stephen Fry doesn't take himself too seriously, although he does show off his erudition while at the Mormon men photoshoot, and the man he's talking to basically says ""I have no idea what you just said.""
The fact this is soon to be available in the US is a good omen. Hopefully Fry's QI TV show may become available. That's a great show, but not stupid enough to be cloned by the powers who run American TV.

The dvd production packaging is extremely no-frills. The fit and finish is ridiculously minimal. There are no extra features on either disc, no produciton notes or other info about the trip, a resource index, anything that would cost virtually nothing to include on a dvd final product. The packaging clamshell is a double with flimsy discholder; mine were jostled and playing loose when it arrived.

The mastering was done correctly at least. The video quality is very good for a standard def DVD.

If there is anything I have a problem with in the actual content, is that this is treated far more as a documentary with minimal discussion on anything but the presentation.

Most high school students don't know geography in this way -- fishing for lobster off the coast of Maine, and then sitting down to eat it; making ice cream at Ben & Jerry's in Vermont; touring a coal mine in Appalachia; seeing numbers runners in New York City and casinos in New Jersey; local bluegrass in a small town high school gymnasium; the Body Farm at the University of Tennessee (you'll never again see such reverence from high school juniors); blues at Morgan Freeman's place south of Memphis (and following jazz and blues up the Mississippi to Buddy Guy's Legends Bar in Chicago -- the pre-2010 version, before the move); making cheese from sheep milk in Wisconsin; Hmong in Minneapolis; truck stops in Nebraska; Ten Turner's ranches and save-the-bison project in Montana . . .  Students like it, they remember it better, and they ask smarter questions about other material we cover.

You won't see the Statue of Liberty.  You won't see Old Faithful.  You will see America, you'll smile, and you'll learn a lot.

Stephen Fry is a treasure by himself.  His view of America will delight you sometimes, but make you think almost always.  You could couple this film with John Steinbeck's book, Travels with Charley, and produce much smarter students.  I'll wager they'd do better on state geography exams, too.

Not afraid to get his hands dirty, he went out on a lobster boat, and got on a horse (I believe he said that was the only time!), and trekked through the woods to see the actual Mason Dixon Line. As he goes, he explores our history and sometimes our mythology, and gives us a quick glimpse of the landscape, characters and customs that are America.
