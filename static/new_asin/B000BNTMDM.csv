2430462,4,B000BNTMDM,"It is inevitable that this movie should be compared to Father of the Bride. John Larroquette is the father of three adult women. The oldest breaks her leg, the second finds her live-in boy friend in bed with another woman, and pretty soon all three are living at home again. To complicate matters, each of them receives a marriage proposal and accepts.

Too much happens too fast to too many people for the story to get into great detail about anyone, although Larroquette does go through some of the same experiences as Steve Martin in Father of the Bride. As each engagement is announced and the expenses keep piling up, he and his wife (played by Karen Valentine) change their vacation plans from a trip around the world, to a tour of Europe, and eventually a trip to Las Vegas. French Stewart has some funny moments as the wedding planner (and he does it without the silly, phony accent that Martin Short used in Father of the Bride).

All in all, this is a fun movie and well worth the time it takes to watch it.",1168473600,15,1017,4.462365591397849
2430463,5,B000BNTMDM,"""Wedding Daze"" is a Hallmark TV movie that centers around a father with 3 daughters who all become engaged and begin planning their weddings at the same time!  There are several times that the movie reminds me of ""Father of the Bride,"" but I have to say that I think ""Wedding Daze"" is much more humorous.  The family sentiment and closeness is nice;  the romances are great.  It is a chick flick, but it is an A+ movie!",1138665600,28,419,4.333333333333333

2430475,5,B000BNTMDM,"If you are a Father of Daughters as I am and you have gone through the business of surviving the business of getting them married then this is  a comedy for you. If you have gone through this then you know the four basics for the Father of the Bride; Show up, Stand up, Put up and Pay up. I found this film to be only a little removed from the weddings of my daughters. For those of you who have yet to experience this, you might what to try having your Little Princess elope - but good luck with that.",1405036800,,502,3.9702970297029703

2430481,5,B000BNTMDM,Loved this movie like many other reviewers. Only problem I've had is that I've ordered it twice from secondary vendors and have received the Jason Biggs version instead.

2430482,5,B000BNTMDM,"I love this corny romantic movie! John Larroquette is a kindly dad with 3 daughters who all end up marrying on the same day. This  movie deals with the issues of adult children (temporarily) living at home, health and aging issues (in a lighthearted way) and the love and humor of a family that gets them through the ups and downs of relationships and planning a wedding.

2430492,5,B000BNTMDM,I had seen this movie on tv a long time ago but was never able to see the credits at the beginning that tell the title of the movie. I saw it again on Hallmark channel and was able to find it online. It is such a fun simple movie to just relax to and not overanalyze.,1347926400,,267,3.7017543859649122

2430494,5,B000BNTMDM,I love this movie! I'd watched it on TV many times. I had it on DVD before  but unfortunately someone else loved it too. It was stolen from my home and I chose to replace it. I don't have the Hallmark channel in my cable lineup any longer so I'm unable to watch it on TV. I love a happy ending. I hope that Hallmark will consider making a sequel as I'd love to see how all of the marriages turned out.,1338422400,,401,3.8902439024390243

2430496,5,B000BNTMDM,One daughter getting married is fun even though it will put a slight crimp in the parent's plans for a second honeymoon. Two daughter's getting married at the same time puts a definite dent in their plans but all 3 blows it all out of the water but these parents take the chaos in stride and fun is had by all.,1326153600,,310,4.098360655737705

2430499,4,B000BNTMDM,"Yes this is a ""chick flick"", but being the father of three girls, the youngest of whom will be getting married soon, I could relate to this film big time.  I like John Larroquette anyways, and the movie has some very hilarious moments, plus some sentimental ones. I think the movie is good enough to watch again.",1258761600,,312,4.473684210526316
2430500,4,B000BNTMDM,Lame but cute. Saw it on the Hallmark channel. Its entertaining and kinda romantic. Very cute. This movie took most of its ideas from Father of The Bride by Steve Martin but tried to change it up somewhat.,1253750400,,205,4.421052631578948
2430501,5,B000BNTMDM,"This is a very funny movie about setting up weddings.  If anyone has ever been trying to put together one wedding, you can understand the issues John Laroquette faces.  The fact that he has to organize 3 at the same time is just a great comedic gem.  It is still touching since it is a Hallmark movie, but it is worth watching again and again.",1207526400,,343,4.246153846153846
2430502,3,B000BNTMDM,"""Wedding Daze"" had the potential to be a very funny movie. Most of the actors portrayed likeable characters who were good to see get connected romantically.
One exception was the Italian groom who we were given the least time to get to know in the film. He was also portrayed a little to much as the stereotypical overemotional Italian.
The other exception was the wedding planner. I enjoyed the fact that he went from trying to calm everyone's nerves-especially the father's-to being somewhat of a wreck himself by wedding day. But even then he was portrayed less than over-the-top as he could have been, and he just seemed to disappear toward the end of the movie.
Some reviewers have compared this to ""Father of the Bride"". The closest ""Wedding Daze"" comes to ""Father of..."" is the father's voice-over to discribe his feelings through the events and the fact that it's about a wedding. There's not near the physical comedy you'll find in the ""Father of..."" movies.
I would recommend ""Wedding Daze"" if you're looking for a humorous movie about finding relationships right in front of you where you weren't even looking.
But if you want a FUNNY movie about a man loosing his mind, along with his daughter and his bank account, I recommend the ""Father of the Bride"" movies.",1195948800,3,1273,4.790909090909091
2430503,4,B000BNTMDM,"This is a romantic comedy and it is full of witty and funny scenes.  The three sisters are quite different but when they get together they click well.

8089523,5,B000BNTMDM,"I have always enjoyed this movie.  Also, as a cautionary word to Hallmark:  Whoever has their finger on the music volume button should
remove it ASAP.  This movie was flawless.  However, the Christmas movies presented in 2015 were not the best.  The background music overshadowed the actors' dialogue most of the time.  Oh, what the heck, it overshadowed it all the time!  Hallmark, get a grip and fix that
problem, please.  There are many of us who look forward to your movies.  Tell the editing people to turn down the background music.
We want to hear what the actors are saying!!  Thank you.",1453334400,3,595,4.689320388349515
