It's enough to get by until we can convince the powers that be to release this out onto DVD.  We can skip episodes 14-16 when whatever mindless wonders let the primary actors out of their contracts and replaced two of them with talentless imposters.  Also why they cancelled the show for good when Mark Harmon was replaced.  He wasn't replacable and it was quite obvious.",1285977600,2,495,4.51685393258427

3146793,5,B0015QT77K,I remember watching 240-ROBERT as a young boy.  It was a great show. I later became a deputy sheriff.  A few years later an Emergency Services Detail was created in the county I worked for.  240-ROBERT deserves a lot of the credit for that.  240-ROBERT also deserves to be on DVD.,1239494400,6,280,4.431372549019608

3146795,5,B0015QT77K,I have been searching for this series on DVD or video for many years.  It was my favorite as a teenager and I cannot find it anywhere.

8259429,5,B0015QT77K,"240-Robert and Emergency were my 2 favorite shows when I was  younger. While I have occasionally been able to see Emergency over the years, 240-Robert has been nowhere to be found. I would love to have this show on DVD. It has always surprised me that it is never mentioned in the bios of the actors because it was an exceptional show.",1455840000,,335,4.403225806451613
8259430,4,B0015QT77K,"This police drama that ran on ABC from 1979-81 pertained to L.A. County Sheriff's deputies working a specialized unit utilizing 4-wheel drive SUV's and choppers usually assigned to land, sea, and air searches & rescue operations in the extensive jurisdiction.

Additionally, 240-ROBERT was based on real life cases encountered by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office's Emergency Services Detail, just like ADAM-12 and DRAGNET were based on real life cases encountered by the Los Angeles Police Department, along with the fact that the L.A. County Sheriff's Emergency Service Detail facility is actually headquartered in East L.A., making them all L.A. County's finest deputies just like veteran police Officer Pete Malloy(Martin Milner)and his rookie hotshot partner, Jim Reed(Kent McCord)from ADAM-12 were LAPD'S finest patrolmen and gritty homicide detective Sgt. Joe Friday(Jack Webb)and his faithful partner Det. Bill Gannon rom DRAGNET were LAPD's finest investigators.

Unfortunately, the ratings took a significant turn for the worse when 240 ROBERT hit its 2nd Season, which was delayed until early 1981, due to an actor's strike back in the Fall of 1980, resulting in its cancelation by the Summer of 1981, which also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch this every Saturday night and when Ronald Reagan was president and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.

This police drama also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it every Saturday night as a kid on ABC.

By the way, Warner Bros. is finally releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on Tuesday March 3, 2015.",1422230400,2,1649,5.0962962962962965
8259431,5,B0015QT77K,I too remember this show as a child.  I later worked 24 1/2 years in Law Enforcement of which 4 1/2 were Officer/Fire Fighter and then 12 years as an EMT on an Ambulance.  Would love to see this series again.,1403222400,,208,4.048780487804878
8259432,5,B0015QT77K,"I've never seen 240-Robert, but my mother loved this show back when it was on the air (however, short lived). She swears this is where she first fell in love with Mark Harmon. When NCIS first premiered back in 2003, I  (age 13 at the time) told her I thought the guy (not, yet knowing his character's name--Gibbs) was really good looking.
At first she thought I meant Michael Weatherly (Tony DiNozzo), and then I said, no, while he is cute, Mark Harmon is super handsome.
She laughed; thinking it was cute that we both had a little crush on the same guy some 30+ years apart : )
All the girls love Mark Harmon...after all, who wouldn't?

I can't wait for this to be released on DVD. I know she hasn't seen it in years and would be beyond surprised to get it.",1399075200,,758,4.256944444444445
8259433,5,B0015QT77K,"In addition to this series being full of action, it intrigued my then young daughter to portray Morgan (Joanna Cassidy). She persuaded several of her friends to participate.  What fun memories would be triggered if she received a copy of this series. I would like one too, not only for the memories, but also to see Mark Harmon pre-NCIS!",1388620800,2,337,4.711864406779661
8259434,5,B0015QT77K,"Seems to me it was on Monday's at 8:00 PM EST and I absolutely loved it. I loved Mark Harmon before most even knew who he was! What a great, great show. I am surprised that it was not more successful -I think they gave up on it too quickly.",1386892800,,240,3.82
8259435,5,B0015QT77K,"I remember watching this show when I was younger, it was a very good show, but didn't seem to last long.
To watch it again would be awesome!  I fell in love with Mark Harmon for the first time watching this.  So happy
that it is coming to DVD.  Please release it soon!",1316044800,6,268,4.018867924528302
8259436,5,B0015QT77K,"I loved this show! I wish it would come out on DVD. It had great characters and a lot of action. I particularly loved the fact that the woman was the pilot.

C'mon, the fact that it has Mark Harmon in it should give it a big enough audience!",1312329600,9,241,3.9183673469387754
