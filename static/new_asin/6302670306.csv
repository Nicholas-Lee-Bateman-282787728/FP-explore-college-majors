501857,5,6302670306,"It's interesting to note the disparity between commercial reviews of this movie (mildly insulting) and the customer reviews (five stars).  This film is incredibly ""out of the culture"" and in fact that is it's  purpose...to suggest another cultural perspective.  It proposes that the  western culture is not sufficient to solve the problems it has and is  creating.  I was amazed at how clearly these actors could communicate such  complex ideas.  Even so, keep the remote handy for rewinding and  reviewing...you won't want to miss one well turned thought.  A terrific  supplement to the book on which the movie is based, ""The Turning  Point"".  Be warned; no blood, no sex, no explosions.",917136000,7,688,5.09009009009009
501858,5,6302670306,"For those with a keen interest in the school of thought surrounding Systems Thinking and Quality Management this movie is a refreshing catalyst to real thought.  There are few movies that can spurn days and days of  discussion on mere lines of dialouge.  As other reviewers have  mentioned...you'll benefit from being wide-awake for this one.  Have the  remote ready for several rewinds as you'll want to hear some poignant  thoughts repeated over and over.

501860,4,6302670306,"Imagine exploring the many ills of the world from three very different personal perspectives - that of a Poet, a Physicist and a Politician.  The conversations can be contrived - as lines go, the actors had a mouthful to  memorize.  But the meaning and exploration behind the screenplay is  fascinating and thought provoking.  This is a movie where physicality is  secondary, the conversational interaction is engrossing.  The setting, on  the French coastal island, Mont St. Michel, is sublime and appropriate to  the conversation.  I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn and  think.",911347200,3,595,5.223404255319149

501894,5,6302670306,"A little dated now, but still a wonderful movie about an American artist living in France, who gets a visit from his politician friend from the States. The politician is in a crisis of conscience, questioning the value of his work and whether it has meaning and does any good. They meet and take a walk and are met by a Physicist who left her work in the US because she was afraid it would be weaponized and her intention in exploring physics was to answer questions about the nature of matter & energy. Each contributes to the conversation, learning from each other, challenging each other and, ultimately discovering the interconnectedness between each of them. Worth watching, to be sure! It's based on Fritjof Capra's book ""The Turning Point"" (not to be confused with the movie by the same title) but brought to life through the juxtaposition of each of the characters.

501926,4,6302670306,"I have loved this film since it's release, and amazed at how the topics are still as fresh as the day the were written. My only frustration is in the fact that this is the only edition of the film on DVD or Blu-Ray that I can find that will play in the U.S.(region 1) and that it is in Full Screen format, not Widescreen.  It also lacks English subtitles, for those (like myself) it matters to.
Though I will not generally make an exception on the screen format (and don't think I ever have before), ""Mindwalk"" is too good and too hard to find to not grab it when the opportunity arises.  I will, however, purchase it again should a widescreen version ever be made available.  As extraordinary as the dialogue and characters are, the unwritten co-star is undoubtedly the Abbey, Monastery, Village and surroundings at the island of Mont Saint-Michel.

501954,5,6302670306,"Mindwalk is an exceptional film. It was astonishing to note Amazon headlining its product description with Tom Keogh's review. Tom, who certainly has a right to his views, slams Mindwalk with words like ""yammering"" and ""chatter."" I'm all for dissenting opinion. However, Amazon shouldn't headline product descriptions with reviews that highlight the reviewer's inability to understand and enjoy the product. He hates talk movies, I get it. Yet many reviews in smaller font below show that Mindwalk has an enduring appeal for many people. Further, the ""yammering"" Amazon blazons above these reviews detracts from the intellectual value of the film. Mindwalk presents ideas that, as of this writing, are becoming mainline science. Chaos theory, complexity theory, and systems views of nature, i.e., Emergent Complexity, get more and more hard scientific backing every week. This makes Mindwalk not only a beautiful, charming film, but also a prophetic one. Tom doesn't like it. Fine, that's his opinion and I wish him well. However, while retaining dissenting views, Amazon should not headline movie reviews by critics so evidently incapable of appreciating them. It's misleading, like selecting a Miley Cyrus fan's review of a Beethoven symphony (""boring, long"") as Amazon's headline review. Mindwalk does not deserve to be trashed before the bulk of reviews are shown: ideas aside, it has great locations, dazzling cinematography, and brilliant acting.",1377820800,,1452,5.515695067264574

""We have outgrown our perceptions of how the universe works.""

A poet, a politician and a physicist meet on Mont St Michel, a small monastery town built on a rock on the shore of northern France, and a profound dialog about the universe, society, science, politics and perception ensues. The movie is based on ideas presented in the book ""The Turning Point"" by Frijof Capra, an Austrian-born American physicist. He is a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, California, and is on the faculty of Schumacher College. (from his Amazon . com webpage)

I first saw this film back in the early 1990's, renting it on VHS from the video store. It quickly became one of my Top 10 favorite films and I bought a VHS copy, which I then shared with everyone I knew.  I have literally watched this movie more than 200 times and I never get tired of the dialog. It's thought provoking and even now, nearly 20 years later, the film is still contemporary.  (I have even been to Mont St Michel in France where this movie was filmed, which was, itself, spectacular).

If you like thought provoking films like ""My Dinner With Andre"" then you will like this film.

I was moved to purchase this particular DVD because the film has not been released in North America on DVD.I had a pirated copy which I had downloaded about 10 years ago from the internet which was a poor tape transfer,(but better than nothing--this film is that good) but have since lost that disc. This DVD is in NTSC format with the original English dialog and Portuguese subtitles, and is NOT a tape transfer. It is crisp and clear as I might have seen it in a theater...had it played in one near me.",1372636800,21,1698,4.569078947368421
501958,5,6302670306,"Philosophically similar to My Dinner with Andre and with a likewise simplistic set-up, this movie explores some of lifes deeper meanings with real understanding.  It's quite an investment for the attention-span, but worth it as far as I'm concerned.

501960,5,6302670306,"This is one of the best movies ever made---which sounds hokey, but 'tis true. It is based on ideas from Fritjof Capra's book entitled 'The Turning Point'.  The movie itself lulls you into a kind of drooling trance--both because of the incredible ideas and history being related by the characters but also the scenery and the little bit of music present. It reminds me of a Greek play in that you have three figures representing in some kind of combination Nature, Man, Science, Arts, Politics, and God (in no particular order).  The first time I watched it left me in the kind of haze that leads to one standing in one place for a hour trying to restart or staring out of a window without seeing anything. It is an intellectual movie equivalent to a blockbuster action movie, but instead of car chases and shootouts, we have a slow walk around a French island and rapid intellectual exchanges that leave one feeling like a brain bomb went off.  I discovered Pablo Neruda's poetry from watching this film.  It is a shame it is not on DVD or Blu-ray. I'm betting the ridiculously priced DVD here was made from the VHS tape through some kind of converter/recorder. Not buying it.",1348099200,12,1176,4.6124401913875595

Anyway, the film is one where you don't realize You are an active participant until the discussions rush out afterwards. It has become a staple, from what I understand, in many High School Physics, English, and Political Science classes, at least it was in mine and some of my colleagues.

I have never had a film that engendered so much discussion and highly critical thinking than this one. The themes argued in the film made for a three day dicussion and a willingness, my students wanted and asked to do this, to write a paper on one of the themes. What ever theme discussed in the film, it's effect and affect challenges one to think about the world they live in and how we perceive the world from a personal to social perspective differently than the Western Newtonian view of the past 400 years.

501974,5,6302670306,"This film came to my attention in a very odd way. A series of power outages had destroyed my refrigerator and its contents and I had put in an insurance claim. After the usual putzing about a Claims Assessor was sent out and as I was going over the events that led to the claim, he suddenly asked me whether I had ever seen ""MIndwalk""?  The question was so far off topic I was really taken aback for a moment. He couldn't be 'hitting on me'! Surely not! Not. Phew!  He had been looking at the titles of books on the shelves behind me and noticed a preponderance of titles connected with quantum theory. Once that was clear, I wanted to know more about the film. I made a few notes, we exchanged a few titles, sorted the claim in about five minutes and as soon as he was out the door I was scowering the net looking for ""Mindwalk"". Not an easy title to find nearly ten years after it was produced, but I persisted and eventually found it on Amazon Marketplace. Maybe having to work for it affected my judgment of the film but having watched it several times now, I don't think so. Maybe it's that - in my opinion 'to die for'- Sam Waterston (you HAVE to see him in a kilt to really get this!) is one of the characters or perhaps that the amazingly accessible Liv is his debating partner or that John Heard gets to be interesting for once, but it's more than that. ""Mindwalk"" is a  a three character play on film, a theatrical experience without having to dress up, hire a sitter, or fight traffic. It's The Tao of Physics, The Tao of Psychology, The Physics of Immortality, Synchro-Destiny, and The Way of The Wizard all in one.  It is a film for intelligent people who want more from a film than entertainment. It is an excursion into the quantum universe without the distracting maths. And best of all, it speaks to the human soul, that elusive part of us that recognises the truth even when we don't know we're looking for it.

501976,5,6302670306,"I have loved this film since I taped it from WHYY Public Television 20 years ago.  There's no denying it's a 'talkie', and cannot even claim the ameliorating grace of drama and historicity of, say, ""A Man For All Seasons"";  The dialogue is no more profound than any heard from college students over a coffee break or more serious dorm beer party.  No, you will not learn the meaning of life, or nature of God, the morality of our legal systems, nor even the nature of the structure of the atom (though such things are casually brought forth by the two main characters, showing the influence of their backgrounds, and I suppose the script was meant to present arguments from those diverse areas of expertise).  But the discussion is not profound, and so it inevitably will draw criticism from self described experts.  Yet the dialogue may stimulate the brain cells of those who, consciously or not, hunger for serious conversation.  It is merely a splash of a cool drink to stave off thirst.

  So now, after two decades, I finally find this rare little gem available on DVD - but only as an import, and priced far too high for me to consider purchasing.  My old VHS tape copy is long gone...I can only continue waiting for a less expensive digital copy to finally become available...hoping I live long enough.",1324425600,16,1309,4.6521739130434785

501978,4,6302670306,"I saw this movie as a presentation at a Unitarian Universalist church a few years ago, so obviously I'm a little predisposed to accept a lot of what was in the movie. It is little more than a monologue about Universal interconnectedness, presented by the socially-aware physicist played by Liv Ullman. The characters of the politician and the poet are used mainly as sounding boards for this monologue. They pose questions that the writers probably assume will be in the minds of viewers so that the Liv Ullman character can provide the answers.

Still, there is an undefined 'something' that is missing from this movie. Perhaps a sense of genuine conflict. The questions posed by the two men are quickly and easily handled by the physicist and little real dialogue happens. Still, their presence gives the viewer an opportunity to look at interconnectedness from different perspectives.

In order to appreciate the content and direction of Mindwalk, one needs to go into it with the understanding that it is an really just exploration of interconnectedness, and how that may relate to both the sub-atomic world and the human experience.",1314316800,,1137,5.042553191489362
501979,5,6302670306,"Some films just stick in your mind & make you keep coming back to them, even when you don't necessarily agree with every single point they're making. ""Mindwalk"" is just such a film for me. I'm a little wary of its mild flirtation with New Age fuzziness ... but on the whole, it's a film that makes me think about & question & re-evaluate my view of the world. Add to that the beautiful score by Philip Glass, the serene & mysterious beauty of the Mont Saint-Michel setting, as well as the presence of three very good & attractive actors who leaven the weightiness of the ideas with flashes of wit & basic humanity, and you've got a thoughtful, even contemplative film that will leave you pondering after the final credits roll.

Yes, it's essentially a lecture on systems theory -- but it's an entertaining one, making good use of the classical conversation form. If the actors are playing allegorical types more than actual characters, they still bring individuality to those types. Liv Ullman (the Physicist) has to do most of the heavy lifting, and it's sometimes a thankless task; but she's always a pleasure to watch, investing her lines with intelligence & passion. Sam Waterston (the Politician) & John Heard (the Poet) are her bemused, enchanted, but somewhat skeptical foils, reacting to her worldview with curiosity & occasional doubts. The actors are good enough to offer tantalizing glimpses of personal stories that aren't in their lines, and that makes me wish they had been fleshed out more.

So ... not a film for everyone, obviously! But for those who want to look below the surface of the everyday, who want to examine the unspoken rules of our culture, it's highly recommended. And just in case you're worried about it being too dry & dogmatic, please note that the final words are offered by the Poet, quoting Kenneth Patchen's ""The Character Of Love Seen As A Search For The Lost"" as twilight descends calmly, inevitably, eternally. In the end, what matters is human longing, fear, and hope. Not a bad conclusion!

(So when will we see a DVD?)

July 22, 2013 update: Having watched the film several times more since my original review, I'm struck all the more by its continuing relevence, its quiet beauty, and the way the ongoing dialogue among the 3 characters makes me want to join in the discussion. Each time I see it, I find something new & thought-provoking; additionally, I appreciate the deceptive simplicity of the acting, which has to walk a fine line between didacticism & understated naturalism. The actors bring so much to their roles, just by body language, facial expressions, and vocal inflection!

And the film also strikes me even more as a midlife film as well, in that all 3 characters have reached a burnout point, a visceral hunger for renewal, even as they look back & re-assess their lives to that point. The final scenes are especially moving & somehow timeless, as if they've been walking along the edge of eternity & are now returning reluctantly but a bit more wisely to the everyday world. How many times have we wished to find ourselves in just such a place, where we can speak from our true, inner selves about the things that matter most to us?

Most highly recommended!

501980,5,6302670306,"It's a crying shame that MindWalk is not on DVD by now. Oh well...but at least there are copies available for purchase. The film is brilliantly directed and acted. The plot takes you through history, from the Middle Ages to the present, as seen through 3 characters of diverse background. What I enjoy about the presentation is its timely philosophy, especially in the arena of global preservation. There is enquiry and query here that will treat as much as it enchants.

I love this film because it gives me a lot to think about and some ideas about alternative ways to look at things. I think if you are comfortable with your ability to make your own decisions about things you should be able to watch this movie without getting too offended. However if you don't like to have some of your perceptions challenged then you might want to steer clear. But really, it's a movie about ideas. Though the characters are confident in their own beliefs I don't believe they are trying to convert the audience per se, just providing food for thought.

502004,5,6302670306,"The scenery is gorgeous and there is no action unless you really like a long walk because the name conveys the blocking and mostly the theme of the doing part of this movie.  The actors are interesting because their careers have taken them many places but waning philosophical on a comfortable stroll is not where you would expect to find them!  Now the characters as written are less than important but I believe that adds to the charm of this particular work.  It truly isn't about who they are as much as it is about the topics they discuss and I think that goal was achieved here.

Sam Waterson plays a politician with a conscience who sees the value in knowing what he is talking about and why being a politician is important.  That alone makes the movie worth watching and memorable.  He reminds us that politicians are actually trying to do good deeds to the benefit of mankind as a whole!

I believe Liv Ulman offers less than an honest portrayal of a physicist as I have known a few but again she is the physicist we would like to have walk among us and there is hope in that.  I found her patience amazing as she piece by piece explains things no one grasps without a masters degree.

The script was written in such clear tones that I feel sure it is safe to call this movie a classic before its time.  I learned two things from this movie I will never forget.  An electron shell is never where you look!  That is significant because it has now been determined that in high speed particle accelerators the observer seems to influence outcomes of tests.  There has to be a subatomic influence being imposed by the human self and it is neither defined nor until recently recognized.  This movie suggests that the act of 'looking' alters an electron shell and new science will inevitably fall from that statement! That makes this movie one that will help the layman grasp changes in our future because if I can understand what was said here then anyone can.  The second thing I learned is how egos in scientific fields can influence peer review literally directing the force of funding and 'accepted' science.  The political overview of the Waterson character shows political influence but what changed the course of man and the world at large is more significantly noted by the delay in considering Descartes work and much of that was personal and petty. Now it may be true that all fields and directions in science have equal merit and it is true this determination only caused a delay in the relevance of Descartes work so it is a matter of durations I think..the world I live in would have been different and the changes that science may make I may never see.

There is an edginess and urgency that comes together towards the end of the movie perhaps based on the two things I learned and told you. What is important? When is it important? What can one man do?  These concerns have a broader and more developed feel to them after watching this movie.  Perhaps it will bring a more thoughtful approach to where leaders would lead us but only if they watch this movie and I am afraid it is little known.

The poet character adds grace to the finale and throughout seeing ever the beauty of life and men and our struggles and goals but he is underdeveloped in this screen play.  Unfortunately when the movie is over I felt the need to wonder why the writer didn't just have them wrestle on the beach or burst into a run somewhere to liven it up.  Unless you listen closely this is a rather dry movie and the average 10 year old would balk at being made to watch it.

Darn shame too!  I really like this movie and have made all my kids and friends watch it...that's how I know about the balking!  Its worth paying attention to what it says though.  Everyone should watch this movie!",1271808000,6,3789,4.47093023255814
502005,5,6302670306,"Ever since I first saw ""Dinner With Andre"" I have a soft spot for movies like this ... meaning anything that tries to be different from the average action or warmed over reruns that we get year after year when new movies come out.  I seek out movies like this and enjoy them mostly.  ""MIndwalk"" is about a conversation between a poet, a scientist and a poltician as they walk around in the island of Mont St. Michel, the castle, in the walls.

The scenery is captivating and interesting, the characters are representing ideas that the writer or the movie is using to try to impart his view of life and the universe, a kind of mix of science and poetry, and the politician is there to mediate how to get that message out to people, most of whom are only interested in day to day realities.

There was things I liked and disliked about the conversation, and agreed and disagreed with in the ideas.  It does seem the Western civilization is at a crossroads as the world gets smaller, and the Newtonian, Cartesian world versus the Einsteinian world is an allegory for that, but the conversations about physics supporting some of what are religious ideas are idiosyncratic to the writer.  They are nice ideas to listen to and I have nothing against them, and I am glad someone took the time to try to present these ideas in a movie like this, but this is just a conversation among people.

There is little change in the characters, action of the sort we see and expect in most movies.  I found it refreshing and enjoyable.  To me the main idea is that we have to start being able to look at ourselves clearly to survive in a world that is changing in ways even the brightest among us do not understand and cannot predict.  The nationalistic idea or identifying with any group and rejecting other groups and using violence to solve our problems cannot continue.

502006,1,6302670306,"Unbearable.  This is not cinematic:  It is the self-indulgent and unsuccessful attempt to shove a high school textbook of the history and philosophy of science--without alteration, cleverness, or artistry--into the format of a 2-hour dramatic film.

This movie should never have been made with this kind of terrible writing.  It is, literally, a nonstop dialog in the form of a conversation about scientific theory among three characters as they stroll along a beach in Normandy.  There is no room for acting (which is as a result hokey and absurd), no cinematography, no natural or realistic human interaction, no storyline or dramatic development, and a tone that is painfully preachy and patronizing.  The characters can only be totally uncompelling and unsympathetic.  There is no attempt to pull viewers in.

While the actual concepts discussed in the running conversation are fascinating on their own, the torturous way this is turned into a movie is saps them of any excitement.  Mindwalk is like unintentional kitsch--minus the life, humanity, spectacle and entertainment value of the tongue-in-cheek, intentional variety--and minus the creative and artistic value of avant-garde cinema.  So whats left?  Unbearable pretense and an awful piece of film.

This isn't a movie that weathers time well.  Few but cloistered, geeky science buffs will find it tolerable, or be able to pardon its fatal flaws.  It's the type of thing that will likely have a small cult fan base.  I've seen other commenters here who wrote that this movie ""changed their entire perception"".

I have been living in a ""Verbal Cocoon"" and not in Reality, no not really, but I feel alot of people are and do. What is interesting is to read all 78 reviews, at this point of time and see how each person abstracts different views and feelings of the movie.  I want to thank Amazon, that they have this feature of open reviews, weather they are Good, bad or indifferent. I feel that is what the movie reflexs, that our enviroment reflects how we see and observe or self and life.  General Semantics refers to this as ""Map to the Territory"".  The Map is what is going on inside our head, and the Territory is what is going on outside our head. Maps are not all that reliable, as they have to be changed to fit the territory, that which is going on outside your head.  One purpose of Education, is to continue to update the map, which is in your head, to the ever changing Territory, which is outside your head.  Example. When you go to a college or High School reunion, the people you remember, say 20 years ago are not the same as now, so you update that map to fit the new territory.  Mindwalk, lets your mind open up and see  future territories, and the ever changing ways of life. First off there are NO answers, only temporary solutions, for the World and universe is in a continue state of flux. If you look at nature,It is not black and white, it is in all degrees, the weather, the sky, the colors, not in absolutes. In nature there is no right or wrong, only process. It doesn't matter what a thing is, what does it DO!  The life unexamed is not worth living, Know thy self! You never can define a word completely, for then you have to define the words in the defination and so on, therefore you have to have a point of reference to go by.  What can be shown can't be SAID!  I find all this comes out in the movie.  I find it would be better on DVD, as then you could pause it after each important discourse.  I find the book ""Levels of knowing and Existence by Harry L.

On the surface, an accessible introduction to quantum theory, a visual feast, and a simple 3-person conversation that ultimately creates the paradigmatic thesis-antithesis-synthesis triangle. Going deeper, an examination of the incomprehensively complex interactions of cause and effect that create ""the human condition."" Finally, a meditation on why all the knowledge scientific in the world can't help us when it slams up against the wall of political reality, an examination of why changing our course as a species may be utterly impossible, and a final monologue (delivered by the poet) that is truly remarkable.

I've shown this film to college freshmen as a prompt for writing, and it never fails to spark interesting thinking.

I was dragged by a friend to see that OTHER ""metaphysical physics""  movie and was beyond disgusted. Mindwalk tackles many of the same themes in an infinitely more intelligent, and intelligible, way. (Plus, it has the added appeal of having been based on the work of an actual physicist, rather than the channeled messages of a 35,000 year-old Lemurian spirit named Ramtha who happens to speak through a woman who looks a lot like Tammy Faye Bakker.)

The performances are moving, the subject matter is challenging, and the arguments among characters are provocative. Those who enjoy intellectual, moral, and political arguments will love it.

502073,5,6302670306,"Science has been responsible for the dominant paradigm (worldview) in Western society for nearly 500 years. This was based on the successes of Isaac Newton and others, and the Industrial Revolution wasn't far behind. Science has moved beyond this worldview, and society at large is still stuck in the past. This film will open your eyes to how modern science views the world. The result is fascinating, liberating, and unifying for those with an open mind.

This movie is almost entirely based on ""The Turning Point"", the phenomenal book by physicist Fritjof Capra (brother of the director). The poet character, played very sharply by John Heard, represents the jaded male viewpoint, as the author's perspective (the physicist) is admittedly feminist, based on the larger dynamic swing of paradigm that our society is lurching painfully into (well done by Liv Ullman). Therefore, this character is played by a female.

The politician character (Sam Waterston) portrays the devil's advocate, as well as demonstrating the difficulty of introducing strong changes into government policy.

The film is dated in one respect: The Cold War was still in full swing at the time the book was written, and the threat of global annihilation has since receded (has it?), but the dangers of nuclear energy persist. Outside of that, every other concept in this film is still poignant and enlightening.

The imaginary conversation between a physicist, a politician, and a poet takes its queue from the theories of Capra's father, physicist Fritjof Capra, who laid his hypothesis down in his book The Turning Point. The book is a wonderfully illuminating read. Whether or not you agree with Capra's theories, and the film's discussion, both the movie and Capra's book point towards some of the concerns of modern physics today and indicate a number of views that are currently being entertained in the modern scientific world. This is not merely true for physics, but it extends to the realms of biology and the social sciences as well.

This film is a valuable contribution because it showcases a new perspective that can provide an alternative to young and adult audiences alike, for viewing the world in a new light. It explores the relationship of humanity with science, perceptions, understanding, creativity, and nature in an easy-to understand fashion.

This movies is not intended to be ""art"" in any sense of the word and if you think that it is meant to be, you should look elsewhere.  Fritjof Capra (on whose ideas this film has some basis) has some interesting views about physics which are somewhat ""mystical"" and which I do not necessarily share, however he prodded my thinking with his book ""The Tau of Physics"" when it was first published in 1975 and caused me to look at the world in a different way. This film attempts to do the same using a Poet, a Politician and a Physicist in the backdrop of the Mont St Michel off the coast of France (Brittany) to explain some of the discoveries of modern physics and relate them to how it affects the average person and if, indeed, it really matters whether we understand the underlying structure in the universe. Note the choice of protagonists. The film is excellent in the way it looks at the world through the eyes of the individuals and tries to reconcile the non intutitive deductions of modern physics.

Enjoy the film and take it for what it was meant to be, a brief introduction to modern physics and the relevance it may have to us.",1101427200,31,1533,4.390845070422535

But even Russ felt he had to apologize for the pretentiousness of the film.  When you go for the walk, you are presented with general systems theory which is probably one of the best things you could learn.  It helps you understand the interrelationships of your subject rather than just memorizing words.  It is called general systems because it applies to everything.

502103,3,6302670306,"How anyone could appreciate this movie after only one viewing is completely beyond my comprehension.  I first saw this on the big screen, and was so totally overwhelmed by the torrent of verbiage that it was difficult to process totally exactly what was being said.  This movie, with its roughly 2 hours of almost non-stop dialogue delivered at a rapid-fire pace, must come close to setting the record in the category of words-to-minutes ratio.
Once one has recovered from the movie's ""shock & awe"" assault on your brain, one can begin to assess the damage.  Speaking as someone with a liberal, pro-environmental outlook, I found this movie to be increasingly disappointing, as it provided neatly-packaged solutions to all of the world's evils & ailments.  Anyone with a liberal outlook should find this approach to be distressing, since it is roughly the same approach that conservative talkshow hosts take...state your opinion as gospel & allow nobody to dissent or question it.  That is not what is commonly defined as a dialogue; it is more a sustained Liv Ullman rant.
This movie has to have provided some of the easiest paychecks Sam Waterston & John Heard have ever taken home, as their characters serve as little more than cardboard cutouts, occasionally lobbing up softballs for Ullman to hit out of the ballpark.  Waterston's character seemed perfectly happy to be trampled into the dust while offering no debate at all...one wonders how he ever survived in US politics for more than 5 minutes.
Not knowing anything about physics, I cannot speak to the scientific veracity of this film, but it appears from the comments of some of the other reviewers that there are a few flaws in the science as presented therein.  If this is so, one suspects that the makers of the film hoped to take advantage of their viewers' scientific ignorance to make themselves appear the more wise.  The same tactic was applied (in regards to philosophy) by the makers of the ""Matrix"" movies.  The result is a self-important movie that reveals its shallowness on closer inspection.
The cinematography was excellent, and L'Abbaye du Mont-Saint-Michel looks magnificent.  I can't say that the Philip Glass score was overly annoying, but that may simply be because the unrelenting flow of words drowned out the music.  I cannot say I hated the movie, but its quality has diminished in my eyes with repeated viewings.",1069286400,8,2400,4.975

502105,5,6302670306,"Mindwalk / Dinner with Andre / Stalker Philosophical Trilogy
Other's have reviewed these movies quite well on their own so I will rather review these 3 as a trilogy because I feel that they are each interconnected in a profound way.
Watch in the following order for these reasons.
1) Mindwalk is more contemporary and accessible I think for most people.
Mindwalk is pretty much a stylistic copy off of Stalker except it has Fritjof Capra's views  on the new quantum paradigm replacing the deep conversations in Stalker. So you don't want to view these two back-to-back.
2) My Dinner w/ Andre is certainly a classic, it will always do you some good to see it, especially when bookended by these other two. It sheds insight into the current human condition of ""robotism"" (to quote E.Fromm).  Where Mindwalk works at the surface on an abstract global level Andre works on the intra-personal level. The dialogue focuses on examples of centered around the concept of our personal ""work"" and dips into mystical acts all the while questioning... how can we be more ""alive""? One can envisions Gudreiff and Ouspensky having this same conversation 50 years prior.
At times it's loops back into Mindwalk realm towards the end.
Aside, when I watch this movie I wonder sometimes if this is where Seinfeld got the idea for his show... people just sitting around the coffee shop having discussion, a parody of our robotic natures.
3) When I first saw Stalker I thought... ""I've been waiting my whole life to see this movie"" and I still feel that way on each subsequent viewing. Stalker then moves the viewer into the transcendental levels of questioning, Of note is it's deep visual metaphors.
When you see the final scene of Stalker you will understand what the true transcendental potential of all the discourse and dialog which you have been privy to for 7 hours is all about.
Aside:  Of sad and ironic note, the very radiations which were described in Mindwalk were the cause of Tarkovsky's  early demise after filming this movie in a Soviet radioactive wasteland.
There are no easy answers with these movies and perhaps they bring up more questions than you'd like but if you are up for a good brain-enema these will do the trick.
Oh... you might as well top it all of with a viewing of ""Mulholand Drive""... you might just understand it after viewing these other 3 films. ;)",1053820800,5,2364,4.758536585365854
502106,3,6302670306,"Mindwalk is part of a series of eye-opening, mind-expanding treatises on how to better view the universe. It seems a large movement is gaining momentum in this generation, building on the efforts of generations past, to find a more cohesive explanation for how the world works from a subatomic level up to politics and religion. While Mindwalk is a great entry into that new sociological wave, it's certainly not the best of the bunch due to a compressed feeling and lack of emotion.
Essentially a daylong conversation about politics, science and art among a politician, a scientist and a poet, Mindwalk provides an entry-level insight into the concept that the various aspects of life may be more intimately linked than we've traditionally believed. The politican and, to some degree, the poet, are surprised to learn this from the scientist, taking on the guise of the novice viewer in that respect. Opinions are shared, examples given -- the most memorable for me being a discussion of the link between music and atoms as accompanied by an antique organ -- and, in the end, all three characters leave their unguided tour of a French castle (a metaphor for the traditional thought process of the human mind?) with a little more insight than they started.
As a way of reexamining life and its underlying connections, Midwalk serves a simple and useful purpose. As a film, however, it suffers -- there is no plot, as the characters merely share their views and stumble upon new realizations, which is more suited to a book than a motion picture. Beyond that, the characters aren't really characters at all but types, their individuality muted and refined so as to best embody the three alleged prongs -- science, politics and art -- of the unifying concept. While I'm sure Mindwalk was a wonderful book, its message and its call to think for ourselves, and continue TO think, fails to take advantage of the film medium and instead feels like a recorded stage play. It's commendable for its philosophy, but not its execution.",1044403200,14,2024,4.886627906976744

I haven't read all of the other reviews, and though I own it, I haven't watched this film in at least a year. Nevertheless...I remember the exact day, time, weather, and circumstances when I saw it the first time. As a matter of fact, I only saw the last half(the first time) on Bravo, and watched the entire film at least five times in the next week. This film tied together all of my fears, hopes, and dreams for humanity, politics, the ecosystem, and the arts in one...and I didn't even know I was a ""new-ager"".

Enjoyed smiling at the poet's role (John Heard), and also enjoyed the charm of lost-Presidential-race-politician (Sam Waterston), but I felt sorry for all the WORK Liv Ullmann went to just to learn ALL those lines rather than what her character was saying, which took up the majority of the movie.  Perhaps I just don't care for so much philosophy outside the college classroom.  My summation: I'm probably not the audience to fully appreciate this kind of movie in the evening when concentration is ebbing.  I will, however, give it another try, if only to make myself feel brighter.  Perhaps other viewers will give this one a chance.

As the product description suggests, it follows a truly great conversation with intriguing people.  One concept it made me appreciate is the systems theory.  You can't understand a clock by looking at a single gear, you have to look at the whole thing.  A prevailing paradigm in people's minds is that the best way to understand phychology, or a social problem, or touble in the work place is to break the problem up into it's smallest parts and understand each part so you can understand the whole.  Systems theory talks about the weakness and innaccuracy of this sort of thinking.

502184,1,6302670306,"Jack Edwards (played by Sam Waterston ...) is a US politician who has just dropped out of the presidential primary  ace. Thomas Harriman (John Heard, the father in the first two Home Alone movies) plays his poet buddy from college days, now living in northern France. Edwards needs to ""get away from it all"" after the debacle of his campaign, so he heads over to France to visit his friend. They decide to get away for a day by visiting a local tourist trap, Mont St. Michel, a medieval castle.
Meanwhile, Sonia Hoffman, a Norwegian physicist living in exile locally, has a tiff with her daughter and decides to visit the castle also. Soon after entering the castle, she overhears the men talking about life, the universe and everything, and feels obliged to chip in. Unlike normal people, the men start to listen to this nosy stranger's harangue, instead of telling her to mind her own business.
Harriman, the poet, is astonished that Sonia doesn't know who Jack is. Quick - how many Americans can tell me any of the unsuccessful challengers for the last British premiership? Hmmm, I thought not. So why would the men assume right from the start that Sonia is a voting American citizen, even though they meet her in Northern France and she has a Norwegian accent? Even worse, why doesn't Sonia question their assumptions? Typical of North Americentric film-making, though. There are some odd discontinuiies in the conversation, so I'm guessing that a chunk of the movie was edited out in the final stages to get the time down. Shame they didn't keep hacking and get it down to, say, five minutes or so.
Having usurped center stage, Sonia rails on about every bleeding heart liberal cause under the sun. At no point does she question her own beliefs or ask the two men what they think. In fact, I don't recall her asking any questions at all. The plot device (and I really should use air quotes here) for the movie consists of the men setting up strawmen arguments for Sonia to knock down and rant on about.
In one of her more curious tangents, she babbles on about being unable to find a metaphor for how empty atoms really are. She tries to use oranges, then the island itself as examples, but the writers missed the boat on this one &#8211; the solar system is a perfectly good example to use &#8211; big empty space, nucleus in the middle &#8211; planets orbiting. Duh! And she's a ""physicist"". Way to go, Sonia.
It turns out that Sonia is in self-imposed exile as a physicist because her breakthrough in laser physics was used on the SDI program. Horror of horrors! A program designed to kill nuclear missiles! How terrible!
If your political beliefs match Sonia's I would guess you'd like this movie, because it doesn't question anything you believe in. So much political rhetoric (from both sides) is like this these days. If you toe the party line, nobody questions how you get there.
Anyway, I made it through about a hundred minutes of Sonia's harangue before fast forwarding through the last ten minutes to see if the ending was anything other than anti-climactic.
Fortunately for all of us, it did end, but without any redeeming car chases or gun battles. I had hopes that James Bond might drop in by helicopter to liven things up in the last few minutes, but no such luck.
Writing credits (more air quotes) go to Fritjof Capra (writer of The Turning Point, the book on which the movie is based) and Floyd Byars, while the director is Bernt Capra (anyone smell any nepotism here?)
You may have guessed by now that I didn't care for the movie. I was unable to find a copy of the book it was based on, but Capra's next book ""The Web of Life"" continues the theme of Sonia's harangue. Same bat time, same bat channel.
But beyond the writing, the acting was extremely wooden. The material didn't leave much room for quality performances, but the acting reminded me of daytime soaps. And by that I mean how good daytime soaps look compared to this.

Clearly the poet holds emotion and words in highest esteem. Passion, love, commitment, family, beauty, pain, fear, loss, and all the rest rule him. I love that. His view of people and the connections between us are most important to him. The world will be.....what ever the world will be. In his eyes, it was his job to observe, to love, and then point to make others look. The scientist could allow herself only pure science and pure thought. she was beautiful in that, but she neglected her emotions, her social self, her daughter, and her emotional responsibilities. the pain in that is only balanced by the pleasure in her science. The politician, oh the politician has the hardest job of all. He has to think and feel and grow and be everything that he can imagine. He has to make it palatable to the masses. He has to translate for the nation. Then he has to get elected. Then he has to take that into a corrupt, old fashioned world and make a change happen. He has to learn so much. He has to feel it all. He has to think and put it all into motion. It is such a burden, such a noble pursuit. WOW I will watch and listen again to get the details of their talk, but the truths were clear and easy to see. we all have something to offer every one of us is just as important as the rest we need each other the connections are everything. it's all that we have. each other and the stuff and nature and everything,,, all the connections. the planet and how we connect with everything on it, is overwhelming to understand and describe there is an easy view towards a power much greater than people. an easy, clear view.

At first look, a third of my students have found the film to be too didactic and the physicist's character a bit imposing.  As the film brings up many scientific perceptions and world events by the late 1980s and before, it should be watched in two to three installments so that the viewers can absorb and ponder about how everything is connected locally and globally.  Years later, several students would return from colleges to tell me how much this film has fostered ""value-thinking"" in them.  They have become more aware of the world they live in and realized that they must learn to take care of it.  The film is exceptionally creative in addressing the size of the atom and the behaviors of electrons.  The theme of interconnections among particles, among life processes, and even among people is carefully illustrated not only in the conversations of the three main characters but also in their relationships with the people in their lives.  The gorgeous yet unique settings of the island Le Mont St. Michel and the minimalist musical theme by Philip Glass also reinforce the film's theme of interconnections.  Look for a touching moment inspired by the physicist, portrayed by Liv Ulmann, as she recalled a memorable visit to Hiroshima.  The poet, played by John Heard, had a funny but insightful outburst as he recited an essential message on the beach.

This movie, and the authors book ""Turning Point"" are nothing more than a phony liberal view of the planet as mother God, and we as simple minded cretins who inhabit it.
Lucky for me Amazon has a wonderful return policy.",972000000,12,548,4.840425531914893
502243,5,6302670306,Remember when Sting sang about Russians loving their children to? When I weary of the Machiavellian aspect of our world I watch this movie and am transported to a place where those who are changing our world care more for  that world than for the blind possibilities of research.,963619200,5,279,4.6938775510204085
502244,5,6302670306,"At first glance, this video may seem a bit dry.  After all, how intersting can it be to listen to a poet, politician and physicist talking about quantum physics and worldviews, right?  The answer to that question lies  deep in your heart, soul and consciousness.  If you watch this movie, you  cannot help but view the world through an entirely different lens.
Each  member of our family has enjoyed the richness of Mind Walk several times.  Our children range in age from 13 to 20 and we find this is a wonderful way  to open their minds to the challenges of clinging to a Cartesian worldview.  Sharing the movie as a family sparks amazingly deep conversations about  the important issues that face our generations.  We have noticed a  quickening in their understanding of the holistic view of nature, man and  the universe.  Our two oldest children have used Mind Walk to write papers  for school on the emerging worldview.  What a gift to learn about this open  and hopeful way of viewing the world at their age!  My husband and I only  wish we had learned of this in our teens rather than waiting until we were  adults to fully understand the interconnectedness of all living things -  and that all of nature is enchanted and alive.
I recommend this video  to you, your family, your friends and acquaintances.  It is a gift to your  soul and the souls of others - from the soul of the world.",960681600,155,1395,4.532258064516129
502245,5,6302670306,"If you are not interested in the above question, and would rather nit-pick about whether there are supposed to be more people in the church and pay more attention to the soundtrack and background than what the film is  actually about, then Mind Walk is not for you. Far from a film for  ""self important people who like to hear themselves talk,""  (perhaps not unlike people who write reviews that say nothing) Mind Walk is  an intellectually stimulating film that shows the relevancy that the new  discoveries in physics have for us and the environment we must live in.  Make no mistake, Mind Walk is different, and is not for those who are used  to your run of the mill action, romance or drama that is typical of most of  Hollywood's productions, including film critics. (to address Leonard  Maltin's comment about pretentiousness, what is acting all about?) If  you're ready for something different, Mind Walk is for you.",957571200,13,923,4.784810126582278
502246,5,6302670306,Mind Walk is not quite as good as My Dinner With Andre but it is still very good. The three main characters are played by wonderful actors which makes the movie even more interesting. This movie is for people who like to  think and ponder about the mysterious world we live in. It is an adventure  for the mind and spirit. It is definitely in my library and one that I  watch often.,956707200,5,382,4.205479452054795
502247,5,6302670306,"I review every time when I get dizzy about the world and myself.  I get connected with everything again when I thing over the issues discussed there. It's a shame that this kind of stuff is not planned to be available  in DVD. It can gain new perspectives, commentaries, factoids, and so on.  I  regret that titles like ""TIMELESS"" and ""CHRONOS"", had  better chances to be transfered to DVD than ""Mindwalk"". If you  are a decision-maker, you must see this video, because is worth seeing. I  mean it.",947635200,9,498,4.590909090909091
502248,5,6302670306,"I too have watched this one multiple times.  Music by Phillip Glass, poetry by Pablo Neruda, physics by Fritjof Capra... The interplay among the diverse personalities of poet (philosopher), politician (pragmatist), and  physicist (intellectual) is beautifully orchestrated and wonderfully  inclusive.  The illustrative presentations of extremely complex subjects,  as well as the ""inconclusiveness"" of the film's  ""message"" is what draws you back time and again.  We are left  wiser in our understanding, but it is left to each of us to figure out what  it means for us on a personal level.  Just as with the characters of the  film, you are left feeling as if you have truly reached a ""Turning  Point"" in your own life.  It is truly a movie for the mind, but watch  it with your whole heart and soul.",942796800,46,801,4.924812030075188
502249,5,6302670306,"Great companion piece to the book ""The Turning Point"" by F. Capra. For people interested in thinking about the planet and integrative solutions to keep it running, until the 7th generation... Excellent acting  and directing. Perfect to be used in educational settings.  A note for the  ""official"" reviewers above: They are just not interested in  thinking.",919555200,3,356,5.303571428571429
7830144,2,6302670306,"I saw this many years ago. I remember the parked car and the long walk to a rather chilling building where the three leads had their lengthy discussion about life. Each one had a different view none of which I agree with. The female lead, Liv, was into machines and how they keep going. There was no mention of God, just machines and such. John's character was more into the common question: why marriages fail. Sam, the best actor of the three, was not in agreement nor disagreement with them, He made good comments in respect to their comments.

I would not recommend this very pricey item. You will be very bored. Buy something nice here on Amazon such as The Firm which you can purchase as a VHS and it always entertains. Tom Cruise is the lead actor and this is probably one of his best movies. Also, you will watch it many times as I have.",1518739200,,845,4.348101265822785

I also read the book that it is based upon before I saw that movie-- The Turning Point.  Perhaps that gave me a different perspective on the movie.  My recommendation for watching, think of all the characters as really just one person.  One person telling a story through three projections of self-- masculine, feminine, narcosis, poet, scientist, etc...
