1781652,5,B00006JMSC,"this disc includes the frist 3 episodes of takahashi's best, in many people's oppinion.  this anime/manga series has already placed as one pf japan's top anime ever, along side ranma 1/2, rurouni kenshin, gundam wing, and several others as a top ten thus far in history.
this anime is AWESOME in japanese.  its got a prime and perfect vocal cast, including Kappei Yamaguchi (Ranma saotome himself) as Inuyasha. the voice of akane plays kikyou in this story.
Viz followed this example well.  the voice of kasumi in english is kikyou, and far to gentle for it.  the second voice of ranma in the dub plays inuyasha in english.  the voice does NOT FIT AT ALL!  and i won't even compare shippou and kagome.  it's bad.  BAD!  the translation is fair, not exact on anything, as dubs always are... and i've heard that later scenes may be deleated in the dub, because they are discussing running it on TV in the US.
the story itself, as many already know, is about a young girl who falls through a well and lands in sengoku jidai.  there she inadvertantly unseals inuyasha, a hanyou, from an eternal sleep, and since kagome looks like the girl who sealed her, and is, in fact, her reincarnation, the two don't get along very well. from the start.
however, it slowly evolves into 'something more' as many obsticles and arch enemies come into play, and we meet new friends.  get this, you'll love it, i promise!",1030838400,2,1400,4.604838709677419
1781653,5,B00006JMSC,"Brought to us by the same woman who created Ranma 1/2, Maison Ikoku and many others, we now have a story of grand proportions.  Kagome is a normal school girl who lives with her family at her grandfather's shrine. One day she hears strange noises coming from a sealed well at the temple and goes to investigate, thinking it is her cat.  Instead she is attacked by a monster like none she has ever seen.  As she falls down the well, she is transported to another time and place...
  This is one of the best anime series I have seen!  The story keeps moving and is a truly amazing tale of both people, and events.  The art is very well done, and the origional voices are amazingly appropriate for the characters.  Kagome is out of her depth but manages to learn and adapt to new situations fairly well, and all the characters show realistic, three dimentional personalities that change as the show progresses.  The show also has a fair share of silly moments like a dog demon being commanded to 'sit' by a magic neclace.  The opening song is one of my all Time favorites!  A great tale of conflict and quests, this belongs on your shelf if you like storytelling, humor, magic, or anything else by Rumiko Takahashi.",1030752000,,1212,4.488584474885845
1781674,5,B00006JMSC,"I started reading the Inu Yasha graphic novels (manga) this year because I fell in love with Ranma 1/2 when I was in college ten years ago and I needed a good comic book fix. (I dig both American and Japanese comics, but I'm not an obsessive collector of either.) After getting hooked on the Inu Yasha books, I started renting the anime DVDs. (I understand that at least one cable network airs the show on TV, but I don't have cable.)
Both the manga books and the anime series are fantastic, a brilliant blend of adventure and humor which anyone can appreciate. Though the premise did not seem as interesting as Ranma initially (hard to beat THAT premise), more depth was revealed as the story progressed. I thought nothing could match my affection for Ranma, but I must give Inu Yasha equal footing.
And though I generally prefer books to videos, these Inu Yasha DVDs are every bit as good as the books. I love the vivid colors, and the English-language voice actors were well-chosen. (I freely admit that I have not seen the Japanese version, nor would I understand it.)
I have read other manga and seen other anime, some of it truly great. But I'm beginning to think nothing will surpass my love for Rumiko Takahashi's creations. They have universal appeal.
(If you're looking for other comic books with universal appeal, check out Osamu Tezaka's ""Buddha"" series. Sweet without descending into schmaltzy sentimentalism, this is truly a treasure for our time. The plot weaves together the stories of many different characters while Tezuka weaves together the old mythology with some modern philosophical concerns, the serious ancient philosophy with occasional modern jokes and gags.)",1084924800,3,1686,4.898601398601398
1781675,5,B00006JMSC,"Kagome is your average middle school student.  Her family are the caretakers of an ancient shrine.  Kagome had no patients for all the stories her grandfather would recite at will until the day a demon popped out of the bone-eater's well and dragged her into fuedal Japan.  There she meets the not-so-charming Inuyasha, a half-demon dog, who wants the Shikon no Tama in order to become a full-demon.  When Kagome accidently shatters the jewel while trying to get it back from a demon she and Inuyasha have to team up to find the scattered shards.  Let the games begin!",1082073600,,568,4.696969696969697
1781676,5,B00006JMSC,"Inuyasha is a tale of its own.  After the opening with Inuyasha in the old Japan fighting for the jewel shard, it begins with the young Kogome falling into a well after trying to find her cat.  When she finally is able to leave the well, she discovers that she is in futile Japan in another time.  Kogome is forced to pull the arrow from Inuyasha that had pinned him to a tree to save the lives of many from Mistress Centipede.  From then on, the adventure begins!
Inuyasha and Kogome have indeed an interesting relationship;  Love, hate, and companionship as they search for the missing pieces of the jewel shard.  This anime series, though seemingly serious, really has plenty of comical relief.  In fact, I find myself laughing more than being stressed about the characters' well being.
However, if you do not like a lot of blood, this may not be for you.  A fight scene takes place in every episode, but this is always complimented with the comedy.  I find that people who do not even like anime happen to like Inuyasha.  This is one of the many reasons why I say it is a tale of its own.
Buying the series may be too spendy though, because each DVD is around $20.00 and there is only 3 episodes on a DVD which is disappointing.  Just when it gets good, the DVD ends.  There's a few extras to the DVDs: changing language to English and Japanese, looking at concept art, and previews for the DVD both done in English and Japanese.  The features really aren't anything to get excited over, but the episodes themselves SHOULD!
Watch Inuyasha...watch it again and again.  This DVD, though the first, happens to be one of my favorites of the series.  But, it gets even better as more characters join in the later episodes.  The story development, characters, anime designs, battles, and comedy is such an excellent combination to make Inuyasha!",1080691200,4,1843,4.573170731707317
1781677,5,B00006JMSC,"InuYasha is the best Anime series ever!!! I love it and you should buy it. Be aware that this is a 130+ episode series. Kagome is so kawaii!!! InuYasha is a half-demon that wants to use a sacred jewel, the Shikon No Tama to turn into a full demon. This is the best and if you buy this you will not be able to stop watching these episodes!!!",1074211200,,340,4.014705882352941
1781678,5,B00006JMSC,"When I first saw Inu Yasha I was put off because the half-demon Inu Yasha, who is male, looked a lot like a female character from another anime series.  But since it was a part of the Cartoon Channel Adult Swim lineup I would watch it while waiting for Cowboy Bebop.  Inu Yasha is wonderful fantasy, with very unique and interesting characters.  The musical score is excellent and I have ordered a copy of that on CD for listening.  I have seen maybe 55 of the 100+ episodes.  The one thing that disappoints me is that you get three episodes, which is not very many on the one hand, and because there are so *many* Inu Yasha episodes on the other.  I have all 26 Cowboy Bepop episodes on DVD, but there is simply no way I will be able to purchase Inu Yasha in the current format.  The DVD with episodes 1-3 is worth watching since it sets up the ""quest"" to follow.  Episodes 1 and 2 are essentially a two-part introduction to the entire story and the two central protagonists, Inu Yasha and Kagome.  Episode three has them pitted against their first significant adversary, Yuri of the Demon Hair (I wish she'd come back in future episodes, she was delightfully twisted!).  Unfortunately episode three ends on a ""cliff-hanger"" all but demanding you buy the next disk.

Another reason to get the DVD to see what the prudes at the Cartoon Channel have deleted or cropped.  Most of it is minor and innocent and hardly ""adult"" if you mean ""for those over 21"".  It is the typical American silliness that you can show limbs being torn off, blood spraying everywhere, but have to cut and cover up a little semi-nudity.

Extras are minimal:  line art, cast list, some promos.

Box art is near identical on every DVD.  You get an open-mouthed ""angry"" Inu Yasha and an open-mouthed ""in shock"" Kagome (with one other major character from the show on later DVDs).  It's fine for the first DVD but it gets increasingly annoying.  Inu Yasha is not just a ""kill everything in sight"" tough guy nor is Kagome a helpless thing needing ""protection"" at every turn.",1073001600,2,2043,4.532786885245901
1781679,2,B00006JMSC,"Now don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE Inuyasha fan. But, I wasn't impressed. Not at all. First off: the voices, to be blunt, are horrble. Compared to the orginal Japanese voices the ones in the English dub sound completely fake and like they're reading off of a bad script. Second: the price. Viz wants $25 for 3 episodes when you can buy 24 episodes in the orgianl Japanese dialouge with subtitles for $30. Third: due to bad voice acting and scripts the character's personalities have changed. Kagome isn't as ditsy as they portray her and Inuyasha doesn't act like a cocky idoit (yes, he is cocky in the Japanese one too but he doesn't act idoitic).
But, if you really like dubbed anime and have a lot of money to spend on the endless volumes with only a few episodes on them go ahead and buy the dub.
It's nothing even close to the orginal, but it gets the point across I guess...",1069459200,6,881,4.345454545454546
1781680,3,B00006JMSC,"It's ninth grader Kagome's birthday, and it's just an ordinary day.  As she's going to school, she stops at her dry well to look for her cat.  All of a sudden, a demon grabs her and pulls her down the well to fudial Japan where she meets the dog-like half demon by the name of Inuyasha.  The music is fantastic and is in my CD player very often.  Time warping, half demons, plenty of action, and memorable characters will give you a pleasurable ride in this one-of-a-kind anime!  There's no reason why you shouldn't buy this DVD!'
...Is what I would say if the price was as good as the anime.  Don't get me wrong, I rate the story 5+ stars and meant everything I just said, but with only 3 episodes per disk, you will be spending a lot of your money trying to get this whole series.  There's not even any worthwihile extras.  Just line drawings and Japanese 'commercials' for each episode on the disk (which is just the episode preview, but with Inuyasha saying it instead of Kagome in Japanese, with no subtitles).  The only good extras on this disk are the opening and ending songs with no text.  But think about the price again for a second.  It would take 5 disks to get only the first 15 episodes.  You just spent $125 and all you got was 15 episodes.  If that's not bad enough, the series lasts 110+ episodes and is still currently running in Japan.  $25 per disk doesn't seem like too good of a price anymore, does it?
If you want to buy this series without wasting your life savings, do what I do.  Buy the Japanese subtitled imported DVDs.  You will only end up watching the Japanese version anyway when you realize how terrible the English version is.  You can get them on a lot of anime stores or Ebay.  On Ebay they're only around $30 per set, and on the first set there's 25 episodes.  Big difference, isn't it?  There's currently 7 box sets out right now.  And if you absolutely MUST have the English version too, you can get the bilungual imports, which are in anime stores and Ebay as well.  There's only one out right now (it's new), but there's 18 episodes on it for about the same price as the Japanese ones.
The price for these DVDs is what turns off a lot of people to this great anime.  I am only trying to stop it from happening by giving you a better way to get the Inuyasha series.  I stupidly wasted $... on the first 5 of these DVDs.  Don't be a fool and make the same mistakes that I did.",1066003200,16,2416,4.2687224669603525
1781681,2,B00006JMSC,"There are only 3 episodes on this DVD (and each suceeding one).  And this series runs for 120+ episodes.  Do the math.  The value of this is questionable, even if the subtitles are accurate, the DVD transfer clear and the dub acceptable.
I highly suggest you buy it used, if you can.
However, VIZ's greed does not diminish the charm of this series.  Inu-Yasha is filled with plenty of action, romance, drama, light horror and humor.  Everything you'd expect from Rumiko Takahashi without the excesses of bawdy humor you find in Lum or Ranma 1/2.  No bra-stealing or blatant fanservice.  And this one actually has an overall plot and character progression!
Inu-Yasha the surly hanyou (half-demon) and Kagome the high-school miko (priestess) make a very good team, even if they do bicker quite a bit.  The band of friends they collect during the course of their quest are fun and intriguing and loveable, their enemies credible as a threat and deadly, but don't think about the pseudo-historical situation too much or your head will hurt.  It's supposed to be escapist fun, and at that it resoundingly suceeds.  And the myriad of different youkai (demons) they run into along the way give a very interesting glimpse into another culture's mythology - as well as glimpses of the melting-pot that is popular culture with a few more Western themes popping up occasionally.
I like this show quite a bit, even if VIZ's release is frustrating for it's lack of value.",1064966400,2,1458,4.842741935483871
1781682,5,B00006JMSC,"Down the Well is the first DVD of Inuyasha, containing the first three episodes. Kagome Higurashi, a normal girl of 15 falls into a magical well on her family's shrine and finds herself 400-500 years in the past. There, she meets a half-demon, half-human boy named Inuyasha, and from there the story begins. Though the first episodes I watched of Inuyasha were later on in the series, these three further pulled me in when I watched them for the first time. The series is very action-packed, and has at least one little snippet of humor in each episode. The music is fairly good, the artistic quality is excellent, and you instantly fall in love with the characters. I recommend this series for everyone but young children (some of the themes are frightening). I hope my review has helped ^^",1064188800,,791,4.697841726618705
1781693,5,B00006JMSC,"The other epic anime by which to measure epic anime. Like any long series, it has its share of plot holes, dodgy filler episodes and mush episodes, but with most anime you accept that as part of the deal.
For the most part, the plot is actually intriguing and engaging, revealed in layers as the story progresses. Action abounds with a fight scene at least every episode (unlike *some* fight scenes I've watched - there are no 5 hour constipated grunt-fest powerups here). But you do have your expected dose of good old Japanese ... humour, and some good tension developing between Inu Yasha and Kagome.
Memorable characters, a decent plot, cool monsters, pretty villains and kick-{ing} fight scenes are a staple of any good anime, and Inu Yasha certainly has plenty of these to spare. If you can stand dubbing, then buy the English version by all means.
If you're a purist like me, I'd stick with the Japanese version or the fansub. I don't know who Inu-Yasha's Japanese voice-actor is, but I like him.",1063411200,,1003,4.704545454545454
1781694,4,B00006JMSC,"Okay this is another great series by Rumiko Takahashi.  If you seen Ranma 1/2 and loved it you should see this as well.  This is the anime that got me into anime, that's how much I love it.
Basically, Kagome Higurashi is pulled into a well on her family's shrine by a demon known as Mistress Centipede after the Shikon no Tama (Shikon Jewel/Four Souls Jewel) that somehow made it's way into her body.  The Shikon Jewel has the ability to boost the power of whatever human/demon has it in their possession, thus making it a not so good thing in the wrong hands.  Turns out the jewel was in Kagome's body because she's the reincarnation of an ancient preistess, Kikyou. Who also used to be in love with Inu Yasha.
The well transports her back to fuedal Japan where she meets the half dog-demon Inu Yasha (Hence the name...Inu Yasha=dog demon).  At first they don't get along too well but when Kagome shatters the jewel and hundreds of shard are scattered all over feudal Japan.  So now Kagome and InuYasha are more or less forced to work together to regain the peices of the jewel.  Along the way they become good friends (Maybe even more.)  They also meet the young fox demon Shippou, a perverted monk Miroku, and the demon exterminator Sango.
That's basically all I can say without adding any spoilers for the next DVD.  The English dub and the sub-titled version are both great.  I reccomend watching them both.  And I actually prefer the english voice actor for Inu Yasha over the Japanese one.  All I can say is check this out it's totally worth it.",1062028800,4,1552,4.523297491039426
1781695,1,B00006JMSC,"Inuyasha is without a doubt the sharpest and most action
packed anime to date about a half demon half man warrior
named Inuyasha who is befriended by Kagome, the reincarnation
of a princess who once sealed Inuyasha because he was
evil. When Inuyasha awakens from his confinement he
sees Kagome and thinks its Kikoyo who put him there,
furthemore Inuyashas intent is to find the demon
shards: shikon no tama, which will give him
further power by converting into a full demons.
The series has other monsters and demons who also
are looking demon chards for further power and deconstruction.
This dvd has only 3 eps and considering how pricey
it is you be better of watching the eps on
Cartoon Network. Cn has bought about 50 eps of
the series which right now total 120 eps , yes 120
eps. Anime critics cant keep count of the # of eps
because Sunrise keeps making new ones.
There is also an Inuyasha Movie that came in 2002
that also fans should get its differently cool to watch if you don't want to sit through the 120 eps of Inuyasha that have been made so far. Like Macross SDF the movie condenses alot
of the series in these hours but delivers the same

1781697,5,B00006JMSC,"Right, so there's this girl, Kagome, who discovers (with the help of a nasty demon centipede) that the well in her family shrine can transport her to the past.  500 years in the past.
Okay, so that's pretty easy, nothing too amazing there I guess.  But you haven't explored the world of that past yet.  You haven't met Inuyasha yet.
Do you know the kind of characters who are insufferable, obnoxious and waaaaay too mean most of the time, yet you *just* *can't* *help* loving them?  Inuyasha is one of those characters.
It isn't just the dog ears (but don't underestimate their powers of charm): Inuyasha, like all the characters in this fantastic series, becomes a well-developed, interesting person in his own right, someone you cheer for when he succeeds, and cry for when things go unbelievably wrong.  He becomes more compassionate and mature as the series progresses, but, thankfully, without sacrificing his wonderfully obnoxious side, summed up in his love of saying 'keh' to so many things.
To go on to discuss what makes all the other characters so brilliant would just take too long.
There aren't many animes out there with so perfect a balance of action, romance, suspense and comedy, either.  I've watched various episodes loads of times, and I *still* burst out laughing at the moments where a facial expression just says it all- absolutely priceless!  The fight sequences are near-stunning, too, in their detail and charged atmosphere.
Music is great.  Well, it may seem a little cheesy at first, but it really grew on me and I love all the themes now.
Avoid the dub.  That is my only warning.  It just doesn't do justice to this series.  The Japanese is far better- Inuyasha's voice is great, and the way his varying tones add to the atmosphere, and many times the comedy, is fantastic.
This is one of those animes you really shouldn't miss out on.  With the epic timespan and period setting of 'Rurouni Kenshin', the eye-pleasing action of 'X', the bouncy fun of 'Ah My Goddess' and the masterful storytelling that Rumiko Takahashi never fails to deliver, it's pretty impossible to not love this series.",1057104000,2,2120,4.8259668508287294

  Inu-yasha is the best anime I ever saw. It's my fav by far it has been for the past two or thee years.
  volume 1 is awsome,the first time I saw it I knew I was in love with the show.  I have also watched 1 through 37 on cartoon network I liked them so much that I recorded them to save some cash. The voices of the show are perfect(well thats my opinion). Richard Cox &Monica Stori (Inu-Yasha and Kagome) are the perfect voice cast.  They capter them perfect esp. Richard Cox. They also did a perfect job with the translation. But I think that Inu-Yasha is the best Anime Rumiko Takahashi has done so far. So I suggest that all of the people who are reading this now & don't realy know the story I suggest you read the books,watch the DVD's or watch it on Adult Swim on cartoon network. Because I know will find it as awsome as I do.
  Thanks for reading htis & I hope it helped you!!!",1056931200,,919,4.1525423728813555
1781699,5,B00006JMSC,"Kagome is just your average 15-year-old girl from Tokyo who happens to live with her mother, brother, and grandfather in an ancient shrine. Kagome has no patience for the legends that her grandfather preaches about and prefers to live her life has any teenager would. Unfortunately for Kagome, she is destined to more than this. One day, while searching for the family cat near her family's well she is pulled into the well by a strange centipede demon. After somehow magically forcing the demon away it vanishes and Kagome is left at the bottom of her well as if the whole thing never happened, or so she thinks. When she climbs out of the well she finds that she has traveled back in time to Feudal Japan in the Warring states Era. Pinned to a giant nearby tree is a strange looking boy with pointy dog-ears. After being kidnapped and taken to a local village she learns that this boy's name is Inuyasha, a half-demon who once sought to possess the Shikon no Tama, a sacred jewel. Kagome doesn't understand what's going on or why she so resembles the last keeper of the jewel, Kikiyo until she discovers she herself possesses the sacred jewel and Inuyasha is accidentally awakened. Through a series of events the jewel is accidentally shattered through out the land. Now Kagome and Inuyasha are the only ones who can work together to find the shards of the sacred jewel. That is if they don't kill each other first.
Inuyasha is an anime based on the graphic by Rumiko Takahashi, the most popular female comic book creator in the world. The characters are impossible not to like. Inuyasha, who shares the main character slot with Kagome, is a complicated hero who doesn't always act heroic. Kagome is very easy to relate to, making her a heroine that you'll find yourself cheering for regardless of the odds. The story lines shown on this DVD are absolutely thrilling. Down the Well has the first three episodes of the TV show, ""The Girl who Overcame Time, And the Boy who was Just Over Come,"" ""Seekers of the Sacred Jewel,"" and ""Down the Rabbit Hole and Back Again."" The first two tell about how the jewel was found and shattered and the third one starts out the two-episode Yura of the Demon hair arc. All three of these are great episodes that fans of anime will enjoy to the fullest.
One thing I enjoy about this DVS is you can watch the episodes both dubbed or with subtitles (personally I don't have a preference but I know a lot of people detest dubs so they'll be glad to know this!). Personally I think the casts for both versions are very fitting to the characters they play (even though Kagome's voice was a bit annoying in the beginning on the dub.) The dub is decent, although whoever wrote the dub script must have had a thing for bad clich&eacute;s because there are a couple of them in here that make me cringe. Besides that this is a great show and not a bad DVD either, if not pricey. The animation is impressive and very pleasing to the eye. After watching this DVD I couldn't wait to watch the next one. I highly recommend you check this series out. You don't know what you're missing!",1056844800,15,3106,4.52846975088968
1781700,5,B00006JMSC,This is a great DVD and I would recommend it to anyone out there looking for a good time and a truly engrossing story. Inu-Yasha has truly changed my opinion on anime! I used to be one of those old fuddy duddies who thought it was just for the overly obsessed and teenage girls but boy was I wrong. This is a well written and animated show with a perfect balance in lighthearted fun/romance and action/adventure truly for all ages and yes guys too!!! As far as the DVD itself goes I feel it was a well designed menu layout and I have to say the English dub is just as good as the original Japanese though you should watch both so as not to miss any nuances and it truly is interesting to hear the personalities of the characters portrayed by different actors. My only real quibble is that there aren't enough episodes to a DVD (3 ain't enough). A word of caution: preview the series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim before you buy in case you don't like it for it is no small investment especially for those who are hooked like I am and buy ALL the DVD's!!!,1056067200,2,1056,4.258706467661692
1781701,5,B00006JMSC,"Inuyasha is in my top five most favorite animes (Cowboy Bebop, Gundam Seed and maybe the older UC Gundams, Rorouni Kenshin, and Trigun)Most say that the english dubbing is either terrible or really good.  Now if you've seen the original japanese show than it might not be the best you've heard.  Lucky for me, and i bet many others,  i haven't so the english sounds just fine(except for lady Kaede's old english, how annoying >_< ...but not unbearable). The show itself is great.  Good animation, a little less detailed then most but it fits the show.  I personally like the japanese feudal setting, something different from all those futuristic animes.  The storyline is great and there's always a lot of action to weigh out all that talking.  And of course humor and there's lots of it.  Most of the humor lies between inuyasha and kagome (what terrible partners those two make, but of course kagome always wins the fights^_^) but all the other characters make it all come together, or do they tear it all apart?  Overall Inuyasha is a must see for all anime lovers (unless you like that annoying and pointless show DBZ^_-)",1055894400,,1125,4.728205128205128

Inuyasha:He is the main character running this show.  The mystery between him and Kikyo, at this point, is still unclear.  But when Kagome frees him from his gravesite, theres undeniably a world of trouble.
Kagome:She is a key factor in the story.  She's just your average Junior High School girl, but when she searches for her cat, she gets sucked down a well, and is in Fudel Japan.  A lot of people belive she's Kikyo because she looks like her.  Even Inuyasha thinks she's Kikyo, but there's more to her than just a recarnation.
This started to grow on me, and I loved the show, but when Kagome shatters the juel to like a billion pices, what looked like a simple walk in the park, just took them on one long ride.

1781703,5,B00006JMSC,"Rumiko Takahashi, ""Queen of Romantic Comedy"", the creator of other great animes such as Ranma 1/2, Lum*Urusei Yatsura, Maison Ikkoku, and more, does it yet again with InuYasha. Based on her EXREMELY popular manga, Inu-Yasha, the anime lives up to great expectations. It follows the manga almost perfectly, has incredible gorgeously crisp animation, excellent sound, completely loveable theme songs (even if you are like me and speak no Japanese these songs will motivate you to buy all the InuYasha CDs, trust me, I did!), totally believable well developed characters, plenty of great comedy, excellent battle scenes, delicous romance (no gross scenes at all completely acceptable for anyone 8 years and up), and a fun to follow storyline. Once you watch just a few of these episodes you will be completely hooked. This DVD contains the first three episode which introduce you to this magical story, you definitely should buy this even if you have never seen the show. There are extras such as the Japanese promos, line art, and character cast list. The DVD is bilingual with the original Japanese dialougue and the excellently dubbed English with English subtitles as well. Most dubbed animes are pretty horrible but I LOVE this one. The voices match the mouths perfectly, the dialougue changes are great, they're funnier than the subtitled translation and spice the show up, the English voice actors are SOOOO much better than the Japanese ones, I cannot stress that enough. I think that the japanese voice actors were poorly chosen and do match the characters personalities but the English ones do. The amazingly cocky Richard Cox does a great job on InuYasha, he also has done voices for Takahashi's other animes such as Ranma 1/2, he does voices for Zoids and Mobile suit gundamn as well. Moneca Stori, Don Brown, David Kaye, Willow Johnson, pretty well known English dub actors are in this as well, all voices go great with their chosen characters. I love the English version so much I won't watch subtitled! Lol. If you've been following Cartoon Network's release of the show, this is much better.
TO SUM ALL THAT UP THIS IS A MUST HAVE!
EXCELLENT WORK VIZ!

Half demon Inuyasha steals the shikon jewel from a village and is hit with a sacred arrow. ""Kikyo..... I can't believe that you...."" is Inuyasha's last few words before he falls into an eternal slumber... or so we think! In present day japan, Kagome is pulled into a sacred well by a centipede demon and arrives at the feudal era where she finds Inuyasha! As the demon attacks, inuyasha wakes up, but is still pinned to the tree. ""Hey... can you... remove this arrow?"" Kagome removes the arrow and inuyasha's powers return. After killing the demon, Inuyasha goes after kagome to kill her and steal the shikon jewel, but kikyo's sister, Kaede (kikyo died after sealing Inuyasha), places o necklace on Inuyasha that makes him fall to the floor when Kagome says ""SIT!"". Soon after, the jewel is shattered, and now Inuyasha and Kagome must find the pieces and make it whole again. However, other demon's are after it too. Yura of the hair, an imortal female demon, knocks Kagome back down the well, sending her back to her time. Then she goes after Inuyasha.

I had high hopes for it since other anime have been well dubbed (Rurouni Kenshin, Escaflowne,Cowboy Beebop come to mind) However, I think the dubbing translation in this series failed miserably. The voice actors sounded ok (but pales in comparison to the Japanese seiyu in my opinion).
What I couldn't stand was the old english & American expressions the characters used! It just made me cringe...shudder!

Because of the language, violence and nudity I can't recommend either sets for children under the age of 16. This is definately R rated material.  This also goes for the original Manga and the graphic novels.

Inuyasha has a good balance between humor, drama, horror, angst, and romance, but nothing too mushy (remember, this IS a Takahashi series) Inuyasha is also much different from her other works, don't expect as much twisted romance (but Inuyasha defiantly has some.) I would say that Inuyasha is more along the lines of Takahshi's ""mermaid saga"" then Ranma.
All and all Inuyasha is defiantly enjoyable, and worth buying.
But, there's always a problem.
And Inuyashas greatest flaw is the dub. Personally I hate dubs, and Inuyashas was no exception. Richard Cox id a farley well job but don't even get me started on Kagome, her voice doesn't fit the character at all, she sounds to young if you ask me. AND her command ""Sit"" has been changed to  ""Sit boy.) Also the dubs script was changed. (Not much, but defiantly not as good as the original.) Plus, defiantly not as much swearing! ^.^

But that's OK--set it for Japanese voice/English subs, and it's great. The subtitle translation is not bad at all--it really helps me, as I still can't keep up with some of the high-speed, idiomatic Japanese. (The dub's translation is very inferior--why do they want to try to Americanize the characters' speech? I'm sure very few of the audience members want that.)
Since I came to Japan, I've gotten tired of most anime. I used to be a total fan when I lived in the US and could only see a little now and then, but here, it's like being able to eat your favorite food, all the time, morning, noon, and night...it starts getting tiresome.

  Anime purists rejoice; while the English-dubbing can be mediocre, this DVD allows you to choose the original Japanese dialogue-with or without subtitles (a fact not readily apparent in many advertisements).

This first volume of Inu Yasha is great. It follows the manga good and the character designs are well done and doesn't do the comic any injustice. The animation is also very good with good use of color and whatnot.
The japanese cast does an excellent job and I absolutly adore it. The dub is TERRIBLE!! I really really HATE it. Everytime I hear it I want to cringe. Some people have said that it's above average but i totally disagree. I've heard too many good dubs (Cowboy Bebop, Tenchi) to think this dub is above average. Inu Yasha is bearable but Kagome's english voice actor sounds unenthusiastic, flat, lame, and just plain awkward, not to mention the fact that her voice just does not suite Kagome's character at all. The script is also what makes the dub seem so bad. I suppose I'd have trouble myself if I were a voice actor that had to say such lame lines, so I'm trying to be a little more understanding. When I say lame I mean really really corny stuff that doesn't even belong there. for example in the japanese version of episode two Kagome thinks something along the lines of
""why....why.......why.......is this happening""
In the english it is changed to (this isn't an exact quote)
""here I am...playing duck duck goose with this six foot monster
in this strange world...""
or something like that. Sorry, I don't remember exactly but you have to admit that aside from sounding dumb, it's an extremly inaccurate translation. Now imagine lame lines like that scattered all about ruining my favorite show of all time.

Well the anime seris of Inu-Yasha is just as compelling. If you are a fan of fantasy anime,or humor fantasy you will love this seris.
Well the story mainly revolves around the two protagonists, Inu-Yasha, and Kagome. Inu-Yasha is a half demon half human creature. It is his most intamite disiear. But to become a full fledged Demon, Inu-Yasha needs the power of the Shikkon no Tama (in english, Jewel of Four Souls). Yet to get to the Shikkon no Tama, he needs to get past a village preistess Kikyo who gaurds and proctects the Jewel. Inu-Yasha steals the Jewel but pays the price. After a battle with the skilled priestess Kikyo, Inu-Yasha is cursed. And with the curse he can never break a deep slumber he was imprisoned in.
Kikyo was also heavly effected by the battle with Inu-Yasha. She wounded so terrible, that she knew that there was no chance of recovery. Kikyo told her younger sister Keade to burn the Shikkon no Tama with her remains, so that the Jewel will never again fall into the hands of evil. And that marks the death of Kikyo, or dose it?
Enter Kagome, and ordinary 15-year-old teenager that lives in Tokyo with her family. Kagmoe's family owns a Shinto Shrine, and her grandfather is kind of crazy when it comes to anchient legends and curses. Well one day when Kagome is heading to school she gets pystracked, and falls down a magical well into the anchient world that Inu-Yasha is from.
When Kagome first enters this new world, she has her very first encounter with Inu-Yasha. Yet Inu-Yasha is still under the curse of Kikyo, so Kagome dose some rather funny things (i won't give it away). But then Kagome is caputred by the natives of a near by village, which is runned by the Priestess Keade, Kikyo's sister.
And soon another demon shows up, demandnig the Shikkon no Tama. Kagome is still totaly oblivious the the secret that hides in her body. The demon called Mistress Centipede chases Kagome into Inu-Yasha's forest, where the half dog demon has awakened from the curse put upon him. But he is not home free. When Kagome approcehes Inu-Yahsa, a button clicks in Inu-Yasha's head that Kagome is Kikyo's reiencarnation......
That is the basic plot for this DVD. I had to end it at that, because at the rate I was going I would end up spoiling the whole DVD for you.
When I first head that Inu-Yasha was going to be dubbed into English, I wasn't exactly thrilled. No offence to dubb fans, but the English version of most anime is not worth all that. Well the English on Inu-Yasha was surprisingly really good. Some of the better dubbing that I have seen.
With a hilliarous sence of humor, I was practicly crying because I was laughing my ... off. Kagome repetedly dose somthing to Inu-Yasha, and it is hillarious, I won't give it away, but here is a hint...

The series is very popular also and Viz has published many Inu graphic novels.  Now back to Inu-Yaha.  The first few episodes are definetly not the best.

I've also read all the manga books! I've been waiting forever for this to happen! If you're gonna get this DVD, I'de say, YOU'RE THE COOLEST!! I'de devenutly get this great item!

Fifteen year old Kagome is a normal girl, until she is ambushed by a demon while searching for her cat, and dragged into the distant past!  Now she's trapped in the Feudal Period, and the demon who attacked her is after her, demanding the Shikon jewel!  Poor Kagome has no idea what the demon means, until the jewel resurfaces. ...  Fifty years before Kagome appeared in their time, the Feudal villagers were assaulted by a halfbreed dog demon, Inu-Yasha, who was determined to steal the Shikon jewel, a gem of incredible power.  This jewel has the power to change a halfbreed into a full blooded demon!  Inu-Yasha's plan was foiled however, when the village Priestess, Kikyo shot him with an enchanted arrow.  Kikyo later perished, leaving Inu-Yasha in an enchanted sleep that lasted up until Kagome's appearance.
Now awakened, Inu-Yasha first challenges Kagome for the jewel, only to be enchanted once again with a necklace of prayer beads.  Now whenever Kagome says ""Sit,"" Inu-Yasha crashes to the ground!  Obedience training the hard way!
Things go from bad to worse as the jewel is shattered, forcing Kagome and Inu-Yasha to join forces in order to retrieve the shards.  But the return of the jewel has attracted the unwanted attention of the local demons and bandits.
All that Kagome wants to do is go home, back to modern Japan!
Finally, a strange woman steals Kagome's Shikon shard.  Yura of the Hair is going to be much harder to defeat than Mistress Centipede!
The dubbing isn't great.  For some reason, the people at Viz chose to give Kaede a medievel accent.  I doubt that they spoke that way in Feudal Japan.  I prefer to watch in Japanese to avoid Viz's bad translations and mispronunciations.
Even so, I can't stop watching these cartoons, it's clear why Inu-Yasha has had a huge following ever since the comics hit US shores.  ...  Inu-Yasha is voiced by none other than Richard Ian Cox, the voice of Ranma, of Ranma 1/2.
Strangely enough, the Japanese voice actor, Kappei Yamaguchi, also voiced Ranma.
All in all, this is my favorite anime ever to come out of Japan, and I highly reccomend it to any fan of Rumiko Takahashi, or just good animes.",1036540800,,2166,4.754010695187166

I suggest you check it out if you have not all ready. The storyline is pretty simple except for the names of the characters. I have been looking forward to it coming out on DVD,but I've heard theirs only going to be 3 episodes on each DVD.With 90 episodes(its still running in japan)3 on a DVD won't cut it. I'm sure the manufacturers are making some money though.
  The main character is Inu-Yasha he's half-demon half-human so Inu-Yasha and Kagome have to find the missing parts of a jewel shard and with it Inu-Yasha will use its powers to become a full demon. This show was made by the same creator of Ranma and a few others. The content of the show however is pretty violent if your watching an uncut version and still is if your watching an edited version,but of course it does need some violence to make exciting. It disappoints me that they toned the content down to meet television standerds,but it's a good show over all,so I think your enjoy this anime as much as I did and I suggest you buy it.",1036540800,7,1140,4.372641509433962

However, I love Inuyasha and am excited to see it come to North America. Having watched subtitled copies of it for the past year now, watching it dubbed and ""cleaned up"" by American censors is a bit disappointing. And Kagome's (or ""Kagomie"" as she pronounces it in the dubbed version) and Kaede's voices are so wrong for the characters (proper English accent in Feudal Japan? I don't think so). Plus Inuyasha sounds like a Californian surfer-boy from the 80's. I gave it 3 stars because the actual anime ( animation, music, original storyline) are totally amazing and should be seen by every anime fan (subtitled if you can get your hands on it!).",1036368000,,854,4.816326530612245
1781736,5,B00006JMSC,"Rumiko Takahashi is one of the, if not the, most famous female manga artist in the world. With titles such as ""Ranma"" and ""Maison Ikokku"" in her resume, she has established a worldwide following and has garnered a reputation as the Queen of Romantic Comedy. Her latest undertaking, ""Inu-Yasha"", has already gained a cult following in the US and, like her other manga series, has been made into a successful anime series that has just a strong following in America. American publisher Viz,  having already published twelve volumes in the US, now brings us the anime.
At first glance, ""Inu-Yasha"" seems like a typical anime series. Kagome, a Japanese high school girl, is transported to the feudal age of Japan through a magical well, where she unwittingly awakens a cocky, imprisoned half-demon called Inu-Yasha. You see, Inu-Yasha was after the Shikon no Tama, a powerful jewel that could grant him his wish to become full demon, but a village priestess called Kikyo stopped him with a mystical arrow. Suffering from untreatable wounds, Kikyo decides to die and take with her to her grave the Shikon no Tama. But get this: Kagome is apparently Kikyo's reincarnation, and she just so happens to have the Shikon no Tama with her! Then, through a bizarre set of circumstances, the jewel ends up shattering and scattering all over Japan, and now Inu-Yasha and Kagome have to team up and find these pieces.
Typical, huh?
Not quite.
You see, ""Inu-Yasha"" is a lot deeper than the first set of episodes will have you believe. Sure, it looks like something you'd find in just about every other fantasy anime series out there, but truthfully, the meat of the series is found in later episodes, when Takahashi demonstrates her true (if not bizarre) genius. But even with this in mind, the first three episodes found on this DVD do a really good job of starting the series and drawing you in. The characters are likable and three-dimensional, and the plot is executed at a reasonable pace. And with Takahashi's unique sense of humor spread all over, you know this series is over-the-top as well as dark and intriguing. Overall, the first three episodes are well done and should give the viewer a general idea of what to look forward to, even though Takahashi's plot twists are completely unexpected.
Visually, ""Inu-Yasha"" is one of the cleanest series around. The artwork isn't as clean as, say, that of ""X: TV"", but it's definately sharp and crisp enough to make an average viewer go ""wow!"". Character models present marvelous representations of their manga counterparts, backgrounds are vibrant and fully detailed, and movement is smooth and fluid. In short, ""Inu-Yasha"" is a beautiful series that does justice to its source material.
Sound wise, the music is a beautiful compliment to the visuals. It's not the most memorable of soundtracks, but Kaoru Wada's melodies are beautiful and wistful and can get emotional when they need to be. The one complaint I have, however, is that the songs tend to repeat themselves quite often and some songs are often nothing more than variations of other songs. But overall, the series' soundtrack has no real complaints. And the opening and ending...well, the ending song is really haunting and ends each episode on a perfect note, but who's idea was it to use a Korean boy-band song as the opening?
As for the English dub...to put it simply, the dub is above average. It does have its problems, but overall it's enjoyable. Richard Cox does a marvelous job as the half-demon Inu-Yasha, bringing the cocky anti-hero to life wonderfully. Monica Stori, unfortunately, stumbles at the beginning as the heroine Kagome. Many complain about her sounding too young, but I feel her biggest problem was that at first she didn't feel comfortable with her role. In later episodes she improves remarkably, but starting out she sounds somewhat stale and flat. Pam Hyatt does a respectable job as Kaede, but she can sometimes sound unenthusiastic and it's somewhat weird that she speaks in Old English and no one else does...
...which brings me to the dub's biggest problem: the script, written by Trish Ledoux, who also wrote the script for ""Ranma"". Trish has an annoying habit of using ""Trishisms,"" which are cliches and catchphrases, in her scripts and it's these Trishisms that bring the dub down. Adding in her own ""touches"" such as the phrase, ""Toto, I don't think we're in Tokyo anymore"" makes the script feel dumbed down. Granted, the script doesn't drastically alter the story in any way, but these Trishisms are the biggest thing holding the quality of the English track back.
So in general, for die-hard fans of the show, the dub will be debatable because they associate the characters so much with the original Japanese voices and thus anything that doesn't fit will render the dub a travesty; nitpicking and complaints such as ""they pronounce names differently"" or ""this voice sounds off"" or ""Kagome says, 'Sit, boy!'"" will definately be popping up in many reviews to come. But for casual anime fans who won't have to go into the show with this kind of baggage for an incredibly popular series, the dub should satisfy.
Overall, the first volume of ""Inu-Yasha"" is a solid release. The only complaint I have about the show is that the content of the series was toned down from the manga to meet television standards (no full frontal nudity, not as much violence, etc.), but that's only a minor complaint. Many will complain about the episode count per DVD, but just remember that the Japanese got only two episodes on the first disc and you may feel better (maybe). But if you're still unsure as to whether you'll like this series or not, you can catch it on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block in a very, very lightly edited format. And since the show gets better as the series progresses over its 90+ episodes (it's still running in Japan, by the way), there will be plenty more ""Inu-Yasha"" to get excited about in the future.",1036022400,75,5952,4.852507374631268

1781739,5,B00006JMSC,"The famed Rumiko Takahashi's -- known for her very popular series like Ranma 1/2, Maison Ikkoku, and Urusei Yatsura -- most recent masterpiece is the story that encompasses many different genres, a sample being: love, action, suspense, and comedy. You wonder how epic the story is? Inu Yasha still has yet to conclude in Japan. Right now, it is currently at episode 86 with no signs that it's ready to finish anytime soon. The second Inu Yasha movie is scheduled for this winter in Japan.
The series is named after a half-human, half-demon called Inu Yasha. One day on her fifteenth birthday, Kagome entered a well that was inside her family's shrine. Little did she know that she would be transported to the past in a time where many youkai (demons) dwell. There she realizes that she is the reincarnation of a past priestess named Kikyo who had the destiny to purify and protect the Shikon no Tama, a jewel that manifests and increases the evil desires and power of youkai and evil humans. Kagome wandered throughout the new place where she had arrived and found Inu Yasha, a dog-like half-youkai that Kikyo had sealed before her untimely death. Kagome had discovered the Shikon no Tama hidden within her while an encounter with a youkai. However, the Shikon no Tama had been shattered and dispersed after battling a different youkai. After learning more about this time, Kagome eventually accepted her destiny to find and protect the Shikon no Tama (while still juggling school work) as well with the help of a likeable cast of strong warriors.
As the story progresses, it branches out a lot and becomes deeper and more complicated. New enemies, new friends, and new loves are all revealed. The only problem with this anime that I had was the addition of filler episodes. I can take a few but they just seemed to have a series of them or at the worst times. They ruined the progression of the story especially when it just started to pick up. Even though they are there to help the character development, when the series has reached a length of like eighty episodes, viewers feel they know the characters well enough already.
The music is very well done. Some background tracks are very nice and smooth that help express the mood. The battle, action, and suspense scenes do help increase tension. The vocal songs have a nice variety of mood settings with the lyrics expressing the tone of the series at that certain point of the series. All the songs are avextrax done by Avex, a well-known Japanese music company with famous artists and groups like Ayumi Hamasaki, Namie Amuro, and Do As Infinity. The opening song is called, ""I want to change the world,"" performed by V6, which has a nice mellow tune to it that fits the start of a story and adventure. The ending song is called, ""My Will,"" by Dream that is a very nice song. It expresses feelings through an upbeat version of a slow song. It has an upbeat tempo but is slowed down and performed with a nice, smooth voice.
Viz brings a reasonable dub to Inu Yasha. Inu Yasha is now being shown on Cartoon Network's late block of more mature anime, Adult Swim. Currently Adult Swim features other anime like Cowboy Bebop and Yu Yu Hakusho. The voices fit with the characters. I had a few problems with some translations and pronunciations. They translated the phrase, ""Osuwari ('Sit' as a command)"" as ""Sit Boy."" I can understand the need to fill in the syllables but it just sounds weird to me. They pronounced a name very oddly. They pronounced Kaede (emphasis on the Ka) Ka-EE-deh with a VERY strong emphasis on the 'e.' But I do commend them on trying to keep the old Japanese feel to it by having terms like Shikon no Tama remain in Japanese.
Final Note: I think Viz will pull out a very solid release and with the story being solid as well, many will continue to pick up this series in the future. The only problem I have is the three episode per DVD release. It's a good thing that the price has been dropped five dollars however, with such a long series, I don't think three episodes per DVD will cut it. I hope that maybe later, Viz will pull it up to four or five episodes per each DVD.",1031443200,39,4150,4.571812080536913

1781744,5,B00006JMSC,"Rumiko Takahashi (Ranma 1/2, Maison Ikkoku, Lum*Urasai Yatsura, Mermaid Series and others)is a master of storytelling.  She is the richest woman in japan--and there's no wonder why once you've seen her work.  Almost all of her manga (comic) work has been animated, and Inuyasha follows the tradition.
At the time of its American premere, Inuyasha has already spawned 3 seasons (64 episodes) and 2 full-length motion pictures in Japan.  I has been enormously successful there.  I myself have seen the TV show (available, much to my appreciation, from dedicated anime fans such as Bernard Khoo) and am VERY impressed.
The Story: 15 year-old Kagome is accidently thrown back in time to the era of Feudal Japan (Sengoku Jidai), where she discovers that she is reincarnation of a priestess who carried the ""Sacred Jewel,"" the Shikon no Tama.  The jewel contains energy that greatly enhances magical powers in humans and demons alike--what a wonderful thing to know when you're 15 and a thousand years from home!  She is saved by a half-demon named Inuyasha (lit. dog-demon) who is quickly recruited to aid Kagome when the Shikon no Tama is shattered into hundreds of tiny shards and spread all over Japan.  Despite his attitude problem, Inuyasha proves invaluable as both a combat expert, comic relief, and even a romantic interest.  More characters follow in later episodes, but I don't want to give too much of the plot away.
Viewers will be impressed at both the english and japanese cast (I like the japanese cast better, but I don't know how good the subtitles are on this edition yet).  The picture has been cleaned up considerably from the original japanese broadcast, and the animation technique the studio used was top-notch.  They went all the way with this animation, and it shows.  The story and character development is swift, smooth and funny, although the plotline has a darker twist.  The show is much less bloody than the comic and a little more politically correct (no fine detail on the half-naked centipede woman, for instance), conforming to the standards of public TV.  It's a great adventure, and you don't need to be a hardcore anime fan to understand it.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone above the age of maybe 10 or so, due to some (but not much) mature subject matter and imaging.  It does contain a lot of magical and mediveal-type violence, but it isn't terribly bloody.",1030838400,2,2396,4.896039603960396

7970527,4,B00006JMSC,"Kagome is a stressed teenage schoolgirl from the present day. Inuyasha is a surly half-demon from five hundred years in the past.

Yeah, it doesn't sound likely. But this odd couple becomes the unlikely protagonists of ""Inuyasha,"" an action-packed fantasy with plenty of romance and comedy on the sidelines. And the first volume of this anime -- adapted from Rumiko Takahashi's hit manga -- leaps right into the action with its odd-couple characters, with solid action and some truly nasty monsters.

On Kagome's fifteenth birthday, she's suddenly pulled into a well on her family's shrine grounds -- and emerges five hundred years in the past.

After being captured by some villagers, she finds that she is the reincarnation of the venerated priestess Kikyo, who died clutching the Sacred Shikon Jewel fifty years before. As the jewel resurfaces (from inside Kagome's body), she inadvertantly wakes a powerful half-demon, Inuyasha, from the spell Kikyo used when he stole the jewel.

Inuyasha loathes Kagome on sight because she's the spitting image of her preincarnation, Kikyo. But when Kagome accidentally shatters the Jewel and sends pieces flying across Japan, she and the grudging Inuyasha have to team up to recover its shards. Unfortunately another powerful demon has set her sights on the jewel fragments -- Yura of the Hair, who uses hair like razor wire. But Kagome has fallen through the well, back to her own time -- how can she help?

Most fantasy series belong in one of two categories -- either strange things happen to the protagonist in their own time/world/dimension, or they fall down the rabbit hole (in this case, the well) into a strange place. Apparently this rule is pretty much universal, because the latter description also applies to ""Inuyasha.""

And this series has a truly striking portrayal of a fantastical medieval Japan that's absolutely crawling with demons and monsters. Though the first few two episodes are a bit rushed, after Inuyasha is introduced the story smooths out nicely. It includes some nasty chase scenes, and some splattery action when our titular anti-hero rushes in to rip apart whoever's threatening Kagome (including an undead giant).

Fortunately even in the grimmer moments, the scriptwriters keep Takahashi's trademark humor into it -- such as Kagome bonking Inuyasha with a boulder, or musing on the weirdness of her situation (""Here I am... in feudal Japan... playing duck-duck-goose... with an EIGHT-FOOT TROLL!"").

Inu-yasha turns out to be very crabby teen boy with superhuman strength, dog ears and a big shoulder chip, and Richard Ian Cox handles him nicely (""It's got nuthin to do with THAT!""), while Moneca Stori is a bit awkward as the disoriented Kagome  (understandably, considering what happened). Fortunately the odd duo start working together before the end, and show some signs of making a good team despite their friction.

The first volume of ""Inuyasha"" has some initial wobbles, but the backdrop of a demon-infested Japan -- and the scruffy anti-hero -- show that it has plenty of promise.",1232755200,,3066,5.150905432595573

When she is dragged into that well by a humongous centipede demon, she finds herself back in the time of the warring states. The demon wants the ""Shikon Jewel"" from Kagome. There's no way she will be able to stand alone against this demon so she will have to free an even more powerful half demon to fight it. That half-demon's name is Inuyasha!

Rumiko Takahashi has a certain magic in her characters. To me she is like the Steven Spielberg of Japanese comics. She has a lot of popular appeal but in the end it's not because she caters to her fans, but because there is just something unique about her character designs, or maybe it's the warmth and passion she brings to her work. I just love her stuff. Inuyasha is by no means targeted at small children. There's nudity, blood, and genuine frights in this volume. It seems Inuyasha and every other demon that comes along wants the Shikon Jewel because it amplifies their power considerably. Actually, that's why Inuyasha was ensorcelled, because Kikyo, who everybody seems to think has been reincarnated as Kagome, had to stop him from abusing his power. It will be interesting to see how this relationship will play out between the two main characters. The animation is fluid and rarely cuts corners. The storyline is a direct adaptation from the manga. Very few extras include Japanese promotional videos, and art gallery.

I would also recommend the manga Mermaid Saga by the same author and also the manga version of Inuyasha. Two other anime that have the same theme are The Twelve Kingdoms and Escaflowne.",1121817600,,1828,4.745283018867925

The sensitive and tender relationship between them will develop in later episodes, but not here.  Inuyasha is raw, and Kagome as well is a little self-centered.

Episode 1: ""The Girl Who Overcame Time and the Boy Who Was Just Overcome""

Kagome's ordinary life as a 15 year-old Japanese schoolgirl is violently interrupted by a chance encounter with a horrible demon, which bursts out of an old, sealed well in her family temple's basement.  The demon drags Kagome in, leaving her distraught little brother shouting after her.

At the other side of the well is feudal Japan, but Kagome does not yet realize that.  Kagome temporarily halts the demon.  In exploring, she finds a strange youth pinned to a tree.  He is under some kind of spell.  She frees him, and thus Inuyasha and Kagome have their first meeting.

In flashbacks, the characters of Kikyo and her sister Kaede are introduced.  Kaede is now an old woman who has taken her sister's place protecting the village from demons.

Episode 2: ""Seekers of the Sacred Jewel

Inuyasha wants to take the Sacred Jewel from Kagome, even if it means over her dead body.  To protect Kagome, Kaede gives her a necklace made of teeth and wooden beads.  Once around Inuyasha's neck, Kagome is able to subdue him with the words ""SIT, BOY!!!!""  From then on, Kagome can use this tactic whenever she needs to.

Now that the Sacred Jewel has been released from Kagome's body, demons come from everywhere seeking to steal it to increase their powers.  A crow demon steals it.  As he is flying away, Kagome's arrow hits the mark too well, and the jewel is shattered into a thousand pieces all over a wide area.

Kaede tells Inuyasha that he and Kagome must learn to work together to recover the jewel shards.  Neither of them is very happy about that idea.  In a huff, Kagome goes back home through the well.  Meanwhile, Kaede and Inuyasha are trying to cope with magical and lethal hair controlled by a beautiful but evil demon girl with the shortest skirt ever.",1093910400,5,2326,4.648648648648648
7970530,5,B00006JMSC,"After a chance fall into an abandoned well, Kagome Higurashi finds herself in the middle of Feudal Japan being chased by a giant demon centipede! Now what could be more random then that? Nothing I can think of...

Well, it just so happens that this ""chance fall"" plops Kagome 500 years into the past, where she meets Inuyasha, a half dog demon who had been bound to a tree until Kagome had released him. To everyone's surprise they find Kagome is apparently the reincarnation of a priestess named Kikyo, who had held a special jewel called the Shikon in her possession, which Inuyasha had tried to steal, getting him bound to the tree in the first place. Unable to get back home and stuck in the feudal era with nothing to do then protect this ""Shikon Jewel"" like Kikyo before her, Kagome naively and accidentally lets it slip into the hands of a demon, and while trying to retrieve it it shatters! Immediately spreading itself in areas all over feudal Japan...guess who's going to have to get them back?

Inuyasha still wanting the jewel for himself, and Kagome responsible for shattering it in the first place, embark on a journey to retrieve these pieces...but end up doing more then they bargained for...

I have to say I was never a fan of Rumiko Takahashi...but after this I was utterly amazed. At first look, Inuyahsa seemed like your typical fantasy anime. A teenage Japanese girl is transported to the warring states era through a magical well, where she accidentally awakens a cocky demon bound to a tree, but looks can be deceiving...

Focus On the Anime

This review is meant for new watchers of Inuyasha it's truly an amazing series and I am glad I get the chance to comment on how amazing.

Story- A+

I love it, I absolutely adore this series, it's to perfect in every way. The characters are lovable, the humor is hilarious, the plot is laid out at a reasonable pace and the twists are unexpected. I've never seen anything like it. Also, The character models are faithful to the manga, the movement is smooth and the backgrounds are incredibly detailed, in a nutshell Inuyasha is beautifully written as well as drawn.

Another compliment towards the story is the many types of themes it holds for everyone such as: revenge, loss, jealousy, hate, rivalry and along with the romance for the gals you have plenty of action for the guys.

(Also another thing I noticed was that it has a similar flavor to my all time favorite book by Lewis Carol, ""Alice In Wonderland."" If you liked that, you'll love this!)

Dubbing- A-

How do they do it? It's baffling really... Honestly I want to know where they find these people! OUTSTANDING JOB TO MOST OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS!  Here are my good and bad comments on some things I think could have been approved and things that were right on!

Inuyasha's Voice- YES! YES! PERFECT! I can't even tell you how relieved I was! For those who watch the Japanese versions...I'm sure you will agree with me that it's always a huge shock when you pop in a dubbed DVD to find all your characters sounding totally different-- some good and some horrible! Well cheers to Richard Cox! WOO HOO!

Kagome's Voice- YAY! It's adorable! I always thought she sounded to old in the Japanese version...but they fixed it in the dubbed! If you want my opinion, get ready for one adorably fiery hot fourteen year old with a spunky attitude!

Kaede's Voice- What the hell is with the old English terms? That was never there in the Japanese version. But...I like it!  It adds a certain era to the show!

Jaken's Voice- I don't think this little guy is in the first DVD...but get ready cause his voice is extremely annoying! What the hell were they thinking?!?!

Music- A+

I love the music from this show! It's very catchy! And what's best of all the theme song and the ending theme song change throughout the series! So you never get sick of them! You'll take a liking to every theme and ending theme and probably want to buy the soundtrack...trust me...it's a good idea. And beautiful background music! I listen to them every night when I go to sleep! It focuses on the old Japanese instruments each characters theme and background are beautiful. Infact, every time I hear this one background song, I burst into tears for no reason...ha ha but really it might just be because I'm a wimp...

Conclusion- A+

It truly deserves it, and if you don't believe me and you don't feel like buying it just yet the show is currently being aired on Cartoon Network's late night program, Adult Swim.  (The schedule is on CartoonNetwork.com) In conclusion, Inuyasha is one of the best animes I've seen, although it is very long, so I suggest you start it with this warning: THERE ARE OVER 90 EPISODES AND IT'S STILL RUNNING IN JAPAN AS WE SPEAK! (Sigh...I dread the day I finish it.) All in all, it truly is amazing and if you don't buy it, you're really missing out on a great series and a show you'll watch over and over again.",1091232000,,4940,4.5770975056689345
7970531,4,B00006JMSC,"I like Inuyasha a whole lot and I have been watching the series on adult swim on cartoon network. It all takes place in a fuedual era of japan and a high school girl named Kagome who is also a reincarnation of a preistess was pulled into an old well. Kagome has an acient jewel in her body and thats how a teleport of some sort opens when a demon pulls her in. Later on Kagome meet's a Half demon named Inuyasha which was put into a long sleep and the only way to wake him up is to pull the arrow out. I am not going to tell a whole summary but the series is really great it is a combination of romance, action, and comedy and I love it completly. But the only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because there are only three episodes in each DVD, and unless you are hella reach you better just stick to watchin it on adult swim more specific cartoon network check this anime series out it is really good...........",1087257600,,923,4.076923076923077
