2013615,5,B0001LYFW2,"A much different take on the whole tour thing. It shows that these guys are in it primarily for the love of the sport. For example, they stop to skate a full-pipe they randomly spot sticking out of the middle of nowhere. There aren't any other skaters there, just them in this huge dirty pipe not even made for skating.

 A big plus is Rodney Mullen, inventor of the kickflip and the heelflip and just about everything else heh. And, we get to see Tony's son Riley more heavily featured than ever before; the little guy throws down double kickflips like they were nothing! There's a menu of extras to explore. Some of the funny ones include Kerry Getz and his tantrum induced shoe-beating/board-smashing breakdowns, and also former pro Jeff Petit who can land stuff every once in a while, but it's way more funny when he doesn't.

 Tony gets really worked on this tour. He breaks his ankle and suffers a nasty 12"" laceration to the shin, but then he keeps on skating of course. Hey, if you ever wanted to see Tony's fresh tibia, now's your chance! I really enjoyed this video and I hope Tony stays healthy, keeps touring, and never stops making these great DVDs.",1091750400,14,1162,4.545454545454546
2013616,5,B0001LYFW2,"Whether you're a serious skater yourself or just a casual fan of the sport, this film is exceptional and certain to please.  While the footage is predominantly skating, you still manage to sense the real human element of these guys.
Tony Hawk is his charming self, Rodney Mullen's tech skills are mind-boggling, Ryan Sheckler proves himself well and truly, Bam Margera stops being an MTV prat, Kerry Getz throws more stuff around...
This is right up there with the best skate films I've seen and I wouldn't've complained a bit if it'd been twice as long as it was.  There's just something different about it.  It was without doubt worth every penny I paid.",1090195200,5,656,4.7368421052631575
2013617,4,B0001LYFW2,"In the tradition of the previous skatepark tours, you get to see what happens when some of the top riders in the world get out and skate some of the best parks in the States.  This one is much less formal and more raw than the demo-oriented skatepark tours.  Just seeing Tony split his shin open and Mullen being his normal insanely technical self is worth the price of admission.  Still for me the biggest surprise was seeing old high school classmate Jeff Petit going all out in a slamfest montage. Inspirational!  My only gripe is that I didn't want it do end so soon.",1086739200,4,571,4.40952380952381
2013618,4,B0001LYFW2,"The best part of this DVD as opposed to the Gigantic Skatepark Tour videos is that it is pure and simple skating without the demo atmosphere. There is more skating involved than before and less banter. I loke the banter, but this shows the guys doing what they love, more than what they have to do.",1080604800,3,298,4.339285714285714
2013619,4,B0001LYFW2,"It's great to see all these guy's together again. Not as indepth as the Gigantic dvd's but fun none the less. I am a huge fan of the past few Skatepark Tour dvd's and this one is just all to short. Not that much ""on the bus"" footage and the coverage at each park could be longer. Overall if your a fan it's a must have! I can't weait to see what's next?",1080259200,,353,3.8493150684931505

8014353,5,B0001LYFW2,"""Tony Hawk's Secret Skatepark Tour"" was one of my all-time favorite movies! I watched it about twenty times, and I normally don't even want to see a movie twice. If you are someone that likes skateboarding or awesome movies, this is the movie for you. It also has great skateboard tricks, and a bunch of awesome skateboarders!",1357084800,,326,4.7368421052631575
8014354,4,B0001LYFW2,"I picked this up the other day and have watched it about 3 times. The music score isn't half bad and that's the only ""so-so"" thing about it. It's good to see Tony and the crew getting out and just appearing unannounced at random parks across the US. He says in the movie that when they show up at a big competition, everyone is already expecting them and there is no surprise factor but when they do these surprise demo's, the enjoyment of the crowds has a better feeling. He also made 2 surprise appearences picking up 2 specific fans and taking them to the local parks or out to dinner, etc and just hanging out.
Worth the watch.",1291680000,,631,4.310924369747899
8014355,5,B0001LYFW2,"This is one of the better skate vids, and I got a crap load of em'.
Many skaters. Many parks. Many styles. Old school/New school. They
even throw a bmx guy into the mix. Tony Hawk injures himself. You can
see a bone sticking out. He tapes it up and continues skating!!!",1284940800,,269,4.1923076923076925
