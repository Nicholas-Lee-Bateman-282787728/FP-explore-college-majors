3031608,2,B000YKT4BC,"In the reviews for McLeod's Daughters Seasons 1-4, the show is described as an Aussie Soap Opera.  I couldn't figure out why, especially with seasons 1-3, which kind of seemed like the type of dramas we have in the US in the evening.

  After what happened at the end of season 3, I didn't expect season 4 of the show to be the as good, and it wasn't, but I have to say that Season 5 is nowhere near as good as 1-3, or even 4.  I finally see why they have described McLeod's Daughters as a soap opera.  Season 5 is just plain unrealistic (this coming from a city girl from the US--how would I know--I can only imagine how unrealistic this is to an Australian cattle farmer).  The show used to be about a farm run by women, and their friends, and it has turned into a bunch of women and their friends who just so happen to live on a farm.  It has become almost all about the characters and not at all about the farm, they hardly seem to do any work, hanging around, drinking tea and beer, once in a while mustering sheep or cattle, bird twitching contests, several ridiculous episodes where Sally goes to the hospital and Nick has to ""take care of Harrison"" over at the cottage (rather than staying at Drovers with the baby and Tess), a high school reunion hiking trip, the same love story that played out between Claire and Alex is playing out with Stevie and Alex (she loves him but never says anything, they carry on as just ""mates""), the songs at the end, when the credits are rolling, have nothing to do with the episode half the time and just seem out of place to me, I can't see how Alex could be running Killarny with all the time he spends at Drovers, Meg is coming and going (and going again), and more.

  Tess and Nick leave for Argentina somewhere around disc 3 and don't come back till disk 7 or 8 and I can't say that I even noticed that they were gone, the show was not better or worse for their absence.  Episodes 135-137 are good. It just goes to show that the show is not the same without Claire, Seasons 4 and 5 are just nowhere near as good.  I cannot imagine where seasons 6-8 are headed.

  I can't say it wasn't worth the price ($55), and I will probably buy the rest of the seasons anyway, just because I want to see what happens, but really, this season is worse than season 4 which was worse than 1-3.  I see a trend here.

  I am sure that another McLeods fan will come along and give a much more positive review than this one, but in all fairness I cant rate this higher because the quality is going way down.",1202428800,22,2537,4.181069958847736
3031639,5,B000YKT4BC,"McLeod's Daughters is on of my all-time favorite tv shows.  It is so easy to get hooked on the characters and their drama.  While the original cast is dwindling, they are replaced with excellent new characters.

I find this show suitable for most ages and genders.  I can imagine tweeners and teenagers would love this show,  I have recommended this show to all my friends and family; most of whom are now hooked!",1399334400,,413,4.602739726027397

3031643,5,B000YKT4BC,"Another great year in the saga.  I do wish the person that chose the title had used a different title.  Such as ""Women of Australia"", or ""Women of Drover's Run"".  Then, the series could've gone on longer.
One  of the seasons, had a mistake in the first tape.  Not sure if it was this series or the last one since I reviewed them long after watching.  But the mistake was in the first tape and it was a step backward.  I actually wondered if I was playing them out of order.  Previous tape had Tess pregnant, then the next season had Tess wondering if they should have children due to the cardiomyopathy being hereditary.",1392768000,,620,4.37719298245614

I am an Aussie and it definitely is very authentic - except for the cattle duffing (rustling) bits -it hugely overplays the crime situation, however I guess that makes for good tension.

I may have to watch Season 5 over again until I get Season 6. I feel like part of family. I get so into this show it's like don't bother me when I'm watching. I was really sorry when it was taken off of TV in the US. I should be receiving Season 6 soon and then I'll be looking for Season 7. I think it only goes to S8 or S9. But a really terrific fantastic show. I highly recomnnend to anyone.,1212710400,,572,3.8974358974358974

3031683,5,B000YKT4BC,"Mcleods is a great show. It is placed in Australia. The relationship between brothers and sisters is great it is what first drew me to this show. It is about five women running a ranch in the outback and the trials and tribulations they have. It is about family, friends and just a great show all around.",1209427200,,304,4.350877192982456
3031684,5,B000YKT4BC,"I first watched the show on a trip there to Australia and we got hooked! Now we've watched all those that are available and, while it's not rocket science, there are still surprises and lots of fun. It is a great escape to Australia with all the fun quirk sayings, terrific men and gorgeous women...and lots of horses, scenery and farming.

Sure, there are some parts that might not be accurate depictions of farming down-under, but for our family who farms in N. America, it is so enjoyable and refreshing. A good chance to feel warm on a rainy day and have a good laugh or teary evening.

I'm looking forward to the new characters in season 6 and the development of the old ones. I regret they are such pricey collections, but I've just now, this second, finished the 5th season and can't wait to hear when number 6 will arrive. So, epic? No...but entertaining and nice family fun/drama. Start at the first and work your way through. Most of all just enjoy the music, sweet emotions and beautiful australia.",1205625600,,1009,4.569060773480663

3031687,4,B000YKT4BC,"Ok,OK I know...It's not as good as seasons 1-3...well,compare the slight decline in script quality to US productions in their 5th season...and this holds up OK...several very good episodes including Jodie's paternity and Tess's return to Drover's(she was in real life having her son and unfortunately is only on next season for 8 episodes) I grow to like Stevie more and more and look forward to her and Alex eventually getting together in season 7 and Moira is a suitable Meg surrogate...all in all good to very good but never hitting excellent...hope next season has ONE standoout episode like My Noon,My MIdnight...",1203206400,6,618,5.068627450980392
3031688,4,B000YKT4BC,"I've watched all seasons available. I hate reruns. I can recommend this will give you something fresh to watch. Season 1-3 are better and the price is high compared to other dvd sets, but there are 8 disks. I hate to say this but I think this series is more for a female audience. So, if the writer's stike is leaving you wanting a new series check this one out along with BBC series Wire in the Blood, MI-5, and Jonathan Creek. All will give you hours of new episodes. Maybe you and friend can each purchase one and then switch.",1203120000,5,529,4.247524752475248

I may have to watch Season 5 over again until I get Season 6. I feel like part of family. I get so into this show it's like don't bother me when I'm watching. I was really sorry when it was taken off of TV in the US. I should be receiving Season 6 soon and then I'll be looking for Season 7. I think it only goes to S8 or S9. But a really terrific fantastic show. I highly recomnnend to anyone.,1212710400,,572,3.8974358974358974

3266180,5,B000YKT4BC,"Mcleods is a great show. It is placed in Australia. The relationship between brothers and sisters is great it is what first drew me to this show. It is about five women running a ranch in the outback and the trials and tribulations they have. It is about family, friends and just a great show all around.",1209427200,,304,4.350877192982456
3266181,5,B000YKT4BC,"I first watched the show on a trip there to Australia and we got hooked! Now we've watched all those that are available and, while it's not rocket science, there are still surprises and lots of fun. It is a great escape to Australia with all the fun quirk sayings, terrific men and gorgeous women...and lots of horses, scenery and farming.

Sure, there are some parts that might not be accurate depictions of farming down-under, but for our family who farms in N. America, it is so enjoyable and refreshing. A good chance to feel warm on a rainy day and have a good laugh or teary evening.

I'm looking forward to the new characters in season 6 and the development of the old ones. I regret they are such pricey collections, but I've just now, this second, finished the 5th season and can't wait to hear when number 6 will arrive. So, epic? No...but entertaining and nice family fun/drama. Start at the first and work your way through. Most of all just enjoy the music, sweet emotions and beautiful australia.",1205625600,,1009,4.569060773480663

3266185,4,B000YKT4BC,"I've watched all seasons available. I hate reruns. I can recommend this will give you something fresh to watch. Season 1-3 are better and the price is high compared to other dvd sets, but there are 8 disks. I hate to say this but I think this series is more for a female audience. So, if the writer's stike is leaving you wanting a new series check this one out along with BBC series Wire in the Blood, MI-5, and Jonathan Creek. All will give you hours of new episodes. Maybe you and friend can each purchase one and then switch.",1203120000,5,529,4.247524752475248
