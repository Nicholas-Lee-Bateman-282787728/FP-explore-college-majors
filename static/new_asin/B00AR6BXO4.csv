8556769,3,B00AR6BXO4,"First off Scarlett Alice Johnson is not the same as Scarlett Johansson.

Four young adults win a trip to NYC from a social networking web site. On board the plane they take part in a game, which quickly grows uncomfortable and has deadly consequences for mistakes. Dave is obnoxious and we learn likes kiddie porn and is a hot head. Jo is an alcoholic. Gwen is still a virgin and Max is a liar.

You have an unseen man with a voice distorter barking out orders. Jo is set up as the ""Final Girl"" as she is the only one we see before the airport. The film is fairly easy to predict...what task would you have a virgin do?

Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.",1480291200,,651,4.233870967741935

8556771,1,B00AR6BXO4,"In Panic Button four online competition winners Jo (Scarlett Alice Johnson), Max (Jack Gordon), Gwen (Elen Rhys) and Dave (Michael Jibson) are invited on an expense-paid trip to New York. On a private jet they join an in-flight entertainment, which is actually a deadly game that involves the fate of the participants and those who are on the ground.

You may forgive and forget the films preposterous premise, cardboard characters, low-budget look, and even the sub-par acting from the cast, but dullness is something different. Agatha Christie mysteries often start with a far-fetched setting and her characters are mostly flat, but at least she knows how to entertain us with a constant supply of clues (or red herrings) and surprises.

In short, there is little suspense in the story of Panic Button. The characters are stock types (so why should we care?), and the games they play are largely uninteresting (again, why should we be interested in the questions related to these stock characters?). Also, at least the Saw franchise has Jigsaw and inimitable Tobin Bell, but as to the mastermind of the in-flight games, well, it was like, Is that all?

I like this kind of thriller about people trapped in an unusual situation. Sadly, Panic Room starts with a pretty good idea, but fails to develop it into a more engaging and suspenseful story.",1383868800,2,1347,4.951327433628318
8556772,3,B00AR6BXO4,"It is kind of like Saw, and there are some legitimate lessons that be learned if you think about it. Very suspenseful, and I wasn't bored.",1379289600,4,138,4.346153846153846
8556773,4,B00AR6BXO4,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": Four lucky winners from a social networking site named 'Alltogether' (yes, Facebook) win a prize to fly to New York from the U.K., all expenses paid, on a private luxury jet with champagne and all the amenities. This includes games and prizes via video. I don't like to create a big spoiler so I will give bits and pieces. There's a purely video version of the little tricycle clown from the Saw series, however, this 'master of ceremonies' is a reptilian version, and he's kind of cute actually (not chilling like the clown from Saw). Suspenseful, twists and turns, great movie.

This is a story of revenge on those who are cruel and callous to others on social networking. This is about one (obviously very wealthy) person's object lesson - the ultimate payback. **Possible Spoiler: The very cool actor from Saw who created all the contraptions is now an Englishman with a private jet, and he uses mostly psychological warfare as his tools.

I recommend it!",1379203200,5,1000,4.808139534883721
8556774,1,B00AR6BXO4,"this is a cheap low budget movie, no fx, no action, nothing, cheap cheap movie, 4 dudes fly in some cheap plane talking and talking like retards, is one of the worst movies of the world, Britons are learning from American, bad movies cheap movies do not buy do not rent do not make copy bad movie",1370649600,,296,4.2105263157894735
8556775,3,B00AR6BXO4,"Four unsuspecting members of the All2gether social networking site board a plane headed for New York, where they must survive several revealing rounds of trivia if they hope to win big cash and prizes upon their arrival. Each new question uncovers another dark secret that the contestants have been hiding in their virtual lives, and the failure to answer correctly has deadly consequences for their online friends! PANIC BUTTON is a perfectly-timed strike against modern technology that exposes the risks and vulnerabilities of living life in the public eye. While the characters and events are extremely exaggerated, the underlying message regarding personal privacy serves as a harsh wake-up call for internet users. What begins as an intense psychological thriller unfortunately trails off into a bland struggle for survive that follows the blueprint laid out in SAW. For Horror on a budget, however, PANIC BUTTON packs enough violence and suspense to earn itself a passing grade.
