8165669,5,B000M2DCQA,"I found this DVD on Amozon while searching for books on how to make Filigree.  I was able to see a snipit of the video and was very impressed with the instructor and her manor of speaking to the camera as if she was talking to me.  Her instructions were clear and consise.  She also pointed out what could go wrong and how to remedy those problems.  She also had different ways of bending the wires than what I was used to.
I've done the first two projects and I'm thrilled with the results. I did purchase the material kit from her web site and found it simplified every thing because I didn't have to worry that I got to correct items.  Her powdered solder works like a dream!
If you have soldering experience and want to try something that will bring more complements than ever, this is the Filigree lesson for you.",1266019200,8,818,4.3202614379084965
8165670,5,B000M2DCQA,"If you want step by step instuctions for making beautiful filigree, Victoria Lansford has made a great tutorial.  You will learn how to make specific projects and have a full understanding of the technique of Russian filigree.

Filigree is a very labor intensive process.  If you are not a patient person with an eye for detail, this isn't for you.  I also wouldn't suggest this for anyone who is prone to repetitive stress injuries.",1249862400,4,433,4.8108108108108105
8165671,4,B000M2DCQA,"My mother requested this as a birthday present. She is a silversmith who is constantly expanding her repertoire.

She was very pleased with the instructions - they were very clear, logical, flowed well, and the videography was detailed and clear enough that she was able to successfully complete her first filigree pendant shortly after receiving the DVD.

It was a bit pricey, but the pendant turned out beautifully. Mom was very pleased that she had a pretty piece instead of the usual mass of melted silver.

Ms. Lanford's website has a short clip from the DVD, and I recommend viewing it to get a feel for her style.",1240185600,5,620,4.722222222222222
