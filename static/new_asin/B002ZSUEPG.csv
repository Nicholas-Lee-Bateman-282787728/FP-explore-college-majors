8385254,3,B002ZSUEPG,"The Mighty Machines video series has excellent educational and entertaining content in the video episodes.  This release has one new episode (new to our family anyway) called ""Reach for the Sky!"" about the uses for the Erickson S-64 Aircrane heavy lift helicopter.  Our son enjoyed this episode and we're glad we got to see it.

Other episodes (that we have seen in other MM releases) include:  ""Machines Go to School"" showing actual footage of construction equipment operators training school, and ""Giant Tow Trucks"" showing how road tow trucks do their work.

This is not a bad video -- it just seems to be less of a value compared to previous releases of Mighty Machines as done by Ncircle.  We've purchased other MM DVD in sets and been very satisfied with the value for dollar spent.  This one costs more than we expected based on what we paid for previous releases, including two of the three episodes on this DVD.

The one thing we didn't like about this DVD was the several Disney promotional trailers about commercial movie releases that we couldn't seem to skip or fast-forward through on our DVD player.

We bought our copy from a used media seller here on Amazon, so we paid less than new retail.  Price for the DVD with just three episodes and Disney trailers is my principal disappointment and reason I rated this DVD with three stars.
