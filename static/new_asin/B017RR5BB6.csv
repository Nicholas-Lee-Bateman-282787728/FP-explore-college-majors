7512784,5,B017RR5BB6,"Being fans of Wiener Dog Nationals, we weren't sure if this movie would be as good, but we were so wrong.  I know it's rare, but this one was just as good if not better than the first.  It's just an all around cute movie and definitely keeps the kids (and adults) laughing.  Highly recommend!!",1456358400,2,293,4.290909090909091
