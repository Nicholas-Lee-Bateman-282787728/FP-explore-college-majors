6162087,5,B00HFWETQW,"Just got this set in today. Amazon Prime delivers on Sundays. I must admit I didn't watch the whole thing of either serial yet. I just wanted to check picture and sound quality and compare them with the two separate previous 2 disc sets I own. The sound seems to be the same for all discs involved. And as far as I'm concerned that's fine with me. As for picture quality, there seems to be not a drastic, but a more than slight improvement.  Not that I thought that the quality wasn't good enough to begin with, unlike reviewers of the previous sets who would moan and groan like little whiners about it. The only drawback is that unlike the previous sets that go from one chapter to the next with no promos or bumpers when 'play all' is selected, this one has the Sony Pictures Television Bomp bomp bomp bomp-BOMP play between every chapter on Batman 1943. Fortunately it doesn't occur in Batman and Robin 1949. But all that aside, you can't go wrong getting this set. The convenience of having a whole serial on one disc is not at all compromised by inferior picture, sound quality or inaccurate speed. Personally I enjoy these best on rainy Sunday afternoons.",1419724800,17,1162,4.533333333333333
6162088,5,B00HFWETQW,"In a bygone era, there were something called movie serials.  They were played after the feature film back in the 1940s.  They were split into chapters to get the audience coming back for the next installment. But I digress, this collection of early Batman adventures hearkens back to an earlier era during the Second World War.

If you like the Batman character these are pure fun.  Youll notice the production values are on the cheap. They were produced on a shoe string budget with actors you've never heard of.  For that matter, they never went on to Hollywood stardom.  Despite all that, they are great to watch.  Not only do you get a glimpse of what movies were like back then, fans will see how the Batman character developed over time.  If you've ever seen the Flash Gordon or Captain Marvel movie serials, this set from the same genre.

Long ago in the VHS era of video cassette tapes, many of these classics were offered.  Its too bad that Mill Creek (the company that distributes this dvd) doesn't release more movie serial heroes like the Green Hornet, The Shadow and Captain America.",1414022400,10,1096,4.661458333333333

6162092,1,B00HFWETQW,"These serials are great fun but they were released years ago as two sets with 2 dvds in each set.

6162093,3,B00HFWETQW,"Batman began as a comic book over 80 years ago. It continues to this day in comic form through several titles still produced by DC Comics. Popular when it began it led to a radio program and then made its way to the big screen.

When most people think of Batman at the movies, they now think of Christian Bale. Years earlier they were talking about Michael Keaton. And before him in the sixties there was Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin seen weekly on television. But the first film version of Batman arrived on screens in a different sort of weekly version, a serial that appeared week after week prior to the double features seen on screens around the country.

In 1943 the first serial, BATMAN, was showing up week after week and thrilling kids non-stop. To miss a week was pure torture, not having seen how Batman made it through the danger he was left in the week before. For the longest time these serials were seen when they first ran and then disappeared from public view. During the heyday of the TV series a number of them were joined together to make a feature that intended to cash in on the show's popularity. Then, once more, they disappeared. A few years back, Columbia released a DVD version of the serial but that left the shelves as well. With the help of Mill Creek Entertainment, those serials are available once again and at an affordable price.

The first serial, BATMAN, ran in 1943 and had the team of Batman and Robin not only taking on everyday criminals but the enemies at war with the US as well. With sets reminiscent of most B grade films, the stories went from week to week as the dynamic duo faced off against the evil Dr. Tito Draka, an oriental villain pulled straight from the stereotypical playbook of the time. With mind controlled zombies, a radioactive guns and pet alligators that enjoyed the tastes of his victims, Draka did his best to destroy Batman and Robin and ruin America. Like that was going to happen. While Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne lazes around where ever he goes, Batman steps up to the plate wielding fisticuffs and his own set of gadgets to take down this enemy in a death defying 15 episodes lasting about 25 minutes each.

The second serial, BATMAN AND ROBIN, came about 6 years later in 1949. With new actors portraying the dynamic duo (after 6 years I would think the boy wonder would have been too old to be played by the same actor) and a new costume, darker this time around, the pair faced off against a new evil in Gotham. This time around the pair faced off against The Wizard, an evil genius if there ever was one. Clad in his own costume this time, The Wizard has built a machine that allows him to control moving vehicles from his secret lair. His plan revolves around stealing some top secret documents but the Batman and Robin don't intend to let him succeed. To make things worse Batman's love interest Vickie Vale is trying to uncover just who the real men behind the mask of Batman and Robin really are. Then we once again have a lay about rendition of Bruce Wayne who appears more like a narcoleptic bumbler than a wealthy playboy man about town. But that's all right because when in costume he more than makes up with the action.

Two complete 15 chapter serials, one box, two DVDs. Curious viewers might not have felt like coughing up over $15 to $20 to find out what this was all about, to see if it was worth the cost. But at $8.78 (amazon.com's list price) it is well worth it. If not for the chance to see a classic serial then to reach back into history for the chance to witness the first incarnation of Batman brought to the big screen. The quality of the films is well made and the movies, while dated and typical of serials back then, still offer great entertainment and historical value. Batman fans won't want to pass this one up.",1394150400,10,3834,4.448079658605974
6162094,4,B00HFWETQW,"When this 2 DVD set arrived, I was in Batman heaven! This long awaited 2 DVD set is finally in my collection. Blu-Ray would be tops! First, a BUYER BEWARE here. For some friends of mine and fellow Batman enthusiasts who feel they were misled. THIS IS NOT AN ANIMATED CARTOON. It appears that some had not fully done their homework before purchasing this product and had only viewed the case pic. Admittedly, the cover depicts our hero's in Animation style. Several had thought and bought, thinking this was some EXCLUSIVE Warner Brother's Vault hideaway. Not the case. Some were frustrated and few blew their Bat-Wigs! This is a 2 Disc, 2 MOVIE SET! I've added a few actual pics from the disc case back view and a scene shot of our hero's.

This is quite literally, the ""Original Serial Chapters"" from 1943 & 1949. Had any of the pics from the reverse side of the DVD case been shown, I think those, and some future, potential buyers might have stayed away. That being said, my review.

1943-15 Chapters. (Batman)  (NOT called episodes)
1.  The Electrical Brain
2.  The Bat's Cave
3.  The Mark of the Zombies
4.  Slaves of the Rising Sun
5.  The Living Corpse
6.  Poison Peril
7.  The Phoney Doctor
8.  Cured by Radium
9.  The Sign of the Sphinx
10.  Flying Spies
11.  A Nipponese Trap
12.  Embers of Evil
13.  Eight Steps Down
14. The Executioner Strikes
15. The Doom of the Rising Sun
To be fair, I will not break down every Chapter piece by piece. In fact, I think the entire 15 Chapters are the closest to Bob Kane's original vision of the Batman mythos. Striped out from Detective Comics, Batman (and Robin) had not much more than the notable Bat Cave. It was merely called the ""Batcave"" early on. It had a Grandfather's Clock entrance. They drove a 1939 Cadillac. With the top up, it was the Bat Mobile. Top down, it was Bruce Wayne's car.

As for the acting, Lewis Wilson played Batman/Bruce Wayne. Douglas Croft as the whimpy, child-like Robin. No other mentionable names were in these Chapters aside from Alfred. A single female role, Shirley Patterson played Linda Padge. Of course there must be a villain. Enter J.  Carrol Naish. He was the evil Dr. Tito Daka with his ""New World Order"" plans.
Remember the date of this airing? 1943 was 2 years into the Second World War. The Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor only 2 years prior. Dr. Daka was the proverbial bad guy who American audiences could hate and Batman could save us all on a weekly basis. Sure, Batman got his butt handed to him on several occasions, but this is Batman! Now to me, and you, we can just hit the play button and see the next Chapter in a second. Back then, the audience had to wait a full week to see if their hero made it?

Columbia Pictures released this first Serial on July 16th, 1943 and was directed by Lambert Hillyer. This Serial was just that. A Serial. Every Chapter is about 18 minutes long. With almost every Chapter ending in a true cliff-hanger, people back in the day, waited for an on-screen performance of what the comics were printing!

A fairly basic plot: Dr. Daka was a Japanese scientist as well as an agent of Emperor Hirohito. He had invented a device that could turn people into a sort of pseudo-zombie. When placed upon their heads, this ""metal cap"" allowed Daka to communicate to them via a microphone. They might be physically closer to him then his henchmen, but only through this microphone could they hear and obey his commands. Comical, but effective. Instilling fear with his ""Radium Gun"", terrorism had its first on-screen leader.
Dr. Daka's command headquarters was located at the end of a Funhouse. The Coaster cars had to be pushed by human hands back then! So much for his technologically advanced work! Again, leaning towards the ethnic slurs, Daka's Funhouse and base of operations, was an Amusement Park located in a Japanese area of the city. Naish's villainous role of Dr. Daka was, by the very nature of the era, a narcissistic Japanese ""bad guy."" In reality, he was an American actor who won the ""Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor"" in 1944. A versatile and multi-talented actor who was much acclaimed in his day. The Dr. Daka role even had some Peter Lorre overtones to it!
As Daka's attempts to zombify America and the world fail, he ultimately meets the ""Dynamic Duo"" in the final Chapter. Unfortunately, it is within this last Chapter that the majority of slurs roll off Batmans tongue. Ok. It IS racist trash! Although, Daka does ask to be referred to as ""Nipponese"" at one point. With his henchmen easily fought off, the ""Electronic Zombies"" defeated, Daka resorts to his last evil trap! The Alligator Pit was awesome! Perhaps Daka should have watched those last steps?
Aside from the dark ethnic slanders, this set of Chapters was more intriguing than the next, more flat-line, 1949 Chapters.

Shortly before his passing a few weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to sit with my Grandfather and watch these 2 Serials with him. His eyes lit up to see they existed at all! As I watched the tears fill his eyes, a flood of memories came rushing back to him. He shared the fond thoughts he had of the Saturday Nights he sat in the theaters watching both of these prized jeweled films. How life actually was back in 1943. He recounted to me, a chronology of how movies were made and the ways of Studio thinking had been during the lean wartime years. Especially, the dramatic difference between his Comic Batman and Hollywood adaptation of him. Given these three weeks of mourning and reflecting of my Grandfather, I felt it best to do further research for this review, in his memory. Better myself as to why both of these Serials meant SO MUCH to him!

""Initially, Batman & Robin were portrayed as FBI Agents in the 1943 Serial due to strict Serial regulations. Due to these very regulations, he said, none of the usual suspects in ""Batman's Rouges Gallery of Villain's"" that he and his friends had come to know at the time, could be reflected in either the '43 or '49 Serials. Thus, Batman (and Robin), were contract Agents for the U.S. Government being under the ""Columbia Studios"" release. While Detective Comics had Batmans' fundamental unorthodox abilities in his workings and motives. The era of wartime thinking had most Studios and actors under them, move towards the ""war effort"" wherever and whenever possible. Even if this meant taking a comic hero down a path of ""symbolic Soldier."" Perfect example was Captain America. After all, Captain America was created to raise awareness with respect to and for the war effort, and be the savior when America was being hit hard! But this was NOT the purpose of Batman or Robin! They were always meant to be, lavishly upscale guys. Wealth beyond anyone else and posses a knowledge to use their riches to catch the ""bad guys"" outside the law. For the betterment of society and help law enforcement, not the Government. This was if only the law be inefficient or cuffed by the very laws they were sworn to uphold. This is where ""Columbia's Government Agents"" and ""Detective Comics"" divergence allowed Batman to become the hero he is known for. Long before the anti-hero or Dark Knight in ""Year One"" as of late.

What a rarity to have such incredible insight from someone who was really there and enjoyed it as it happened! One thing my Grandfather did agree on, and was excited to see, was that the original film stock was absolutely genuine to what he recalled! Everything from the nicks, tears, ""cigarette burns"" as he called them (those little white boxes that show up for a split second in the upper corners that even I hadn't noticed), he loved! A plus for sure, were all those other poorly achieved captures that 1940's Hollywood Studio Filming couldn't master yet. He talked about what he called, Big Screen T.V. because his, and most, families couldn't afford a furniture size television, the theater WAS the TV! The theater going experience was the ONLY audio-visual entertainment available to middle income America. He said, ""the Serials were a prodigious experience and extremely popular."" ""That went for troops returning from the front, and those waiting for their shipping papers. Families, kids or anyone who needed a break from the harsh realities of the war.""

What a cherished time I had with my Grandfather and wealth of knowledge he passed to me from his own memories over a simple Batman & Robin Serial viewing, even if it was his last. Maybe it was karma that I purchased this DVD set when I did, and my 3rd time watching it. And his last. He is loved and missed! Had it not been for his joy in watching these 2 Serials with me, I would not have embarked on this journey of discovery. I reached to an old college buddy, (Directing Major), I learned that these Batman & Robin Serials were much more than 2, 15 Chapter storylines. I found they are pieces of history. Plus, works of art that bridged 3 generations and sparked conversations that are much more valuable. They came from the heart and will be passed on to my son's, when he can understand the gravity of his Great-Grandfathers life!

Ultimately left alone from the Hollywood hype, Batman became, what Detective Comics had sculpted him to be. A crime fighter who used his wealth to work outside the law. None of his ""toys or gadgets "" had come into play yet. The costume was so obviously hand-sewn, even in his way at times. Both Batman & Robin's costumes were later deemed to be just that, and critics shamed them for the worse. The Batman costume was ""baggy"" and the ears looked like Devil horns! Not to mention Lewis Wilson's physic. He was of sufficient girth around the mid-section and not athletic enough.
The utility-belt was just part of the get-up. All characters were two dimensional at best. Oh, please, Robin? He was couldn't have been more than 16, and his overwhelming closeness to both Bruce Wayne and Batman can leave one thinking he was too effeminate! All of these actors were ditched for the second Serial. Thank goodness!

This first 1943 series of 15 Chapters is filled with film nicks, tears and lens framing problems. Most prevalent in the first Chapter, is ""white wash"" as the camera tries to adjust for the deep black crush. By no means is this a deal breaker, it was difficult to watch. Rampant throughout this series, ""glitches"" became softer and I just assimilated to them all. I believe, (now know), what I saw was of original film stock and this added to the general appeal.

One of the funniest standouts in both of these Serials, more so in the latter '49 Chapters, lies within the fight scene's. ALL fighting that occurs whenever the Duo go at it, Batman takes on the bulk of thugs. Robin in turn, handles no more than a single bad guy! This scuffle seems to last through the entire fight scene, and as Batman does in the rest, even get tossed off a rooftop, still Robin barely gets back on his feet, getting walloped from the SAME THUG! I guess that's why the Dark Knight of late, works alone!

This 1949 Serial was much cleaner. Still lens problems, glitches and obvious frame tears. But overall, there are no whitewashes or B&W color problems. For the film industry as a whole, 6 years had passed. Lessons were learned and how to utilize the camera and lighting had grown up. Sound was still in its infancy, so I believe what I heard was genuine to the era.

Casting changes were for the better too. Robert Lowery as Batman/Bruce Wayne, John Duncan as Robin/Dick Grayson, Jane Adams as Vicki Vail, Lyle Talbot as Comissioner Gordon and Ralph Graves as Harission/Wizard.
Some of these aforementioned names we know and taken from the pages of the Batman mythos. Strange though how Alfred was not mentioned in any of the credits in either Serial? Here, in the '49 Serial, Eric Wilton played Alfred.

An interesting note... The comics had been drawing Alfred, up until this point, as an overweight, clean shaven man. In the '43 Serial William Austin played Alfred. He sported a thin moustache and was much more slim than his comic-book counterpart. Austin's look for Alfred was more appealing to Batman's lifestyle. Hence a new Alfred was born! This new look for Alfred is still seen in print today!
Released on May 26th, 1949. Directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet. The plot is extremely flat and thin. Cautiously ironic to todays world. The power of Remote Control! Once more, BOTH costumes were poorly fitted. Batman's Cowl sat low on his nose and Robin needed PINK tights to cover his hairy legs! The '39 Cadillac was exchanged for the modernized 1949 Mercury. Still, there had yet to be an actual Batmobile.
An example of comic-to-screen in continuity in this Serial was the ""Bat Signal"" working during the day. The signal was supposed to be a nighttime sight to send fear into those who mean to bring harm to Gotham City. It should never have been visible in broad daylight! Given the era of late 1940's movie making, and much less, comic conversions, little thought was put into detail of purely satirical views of a comic book hero. There were other minor misses. The ""Utility Belts"" had been swapped for BELTS. No pockets or holders. Yet in some circumstances, items WERE taken out by Batman from HIS BELT, that made a big difference to save his life. Thus furthering the Chapters onto the next! The Wizard oddly remains cloaked for the entirety of the Serial, until the very end. Even to his own men, he keeps the hood over his face. Very funny that no matter the motive, the Wizard turns the SAME dials on his machines in order to reach the same objectives. Very little imagination.
As for the film itself, seemingly one flaw is repetitive throughout all the '49 Chapters. A thin, little splice line is present that may or may not antedate the original negatives. Not overbearing or profound, but these lines are noticeable.

 The acting in BOTH series of Chapters seemed to be sincere and more likely, not spoof. Back then, there was no template to go by other than what Detective Comics had written OR torn from the headlines of the day. Campy? Somewhat. By today's standards, yes. Up against the 60's Batman & Robin, well, those were the 1960's!

The only downside to this wonderful rendition of the original Batman & Robin is within the 1943 Chapters. The highly politically incorrect use of the inflammatory terms, ""Oriental Brains"", and , ""Jap's."" Being that America was in the midst of WWII, the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor, the Japanese people were vilified and were foddor for any and all anger. Dr. Taka was the enemy and America rallied against him along with our troops. Still, to hear Batman use those slurs, was unsettling. Maybe the country was desensitized to the hateful words, but in today's society, one would never hear any hero from DC or Marvel say such things! Not a deal breaker yet, but be prepared for the word! When these Serials were released on VHS, heavy editing was done to ensure most, if not all, racial slurs hit the chopping block. Re-released back onto DVD, those cut versions were ditched and ""restored"" back to their original theatrical cuts as intended. Possibly Studio exec's figured that there are so many more movies out that contain harsher language and explicit nudity, why not give fans the original?

So, in all that I just wrote, what is it about these 2 DVD's was it that I saw fit to give a 4 Star rating? Well, partly the very reasons that were NOT displayed in the advertisement for the set! It was a bit of low-balling or, ""deceptive advertising"" to NOT say anything in the description that this was a MOVIE, and not the seemingly animation style that the front cover shows. The wording in the description category is simply NOT THERE!
Is it misleading? Possibly. Had YOU known this was NOT an animated, exclusive short you hadn't heard of, would you still buy it? It does say on the case cover what this DVD set includes. But advertising is all about catching the eye, in the hopes of making a decision immediately! PLEASE READ THE CASE COVER FIRST!

After watching all 30 Chapters, I found myself wondering how the people who first rushed to the theaters to see these shorts felt? I mean, we are talking about 70 years ago! 15 weeks to see the full storyline of each Serial. And if they missed a week, they had to ask a friend what happened to Batman last week?  That is an amazing thought to put yourself all those years ago. During WWII, part two was 4 years after. This is a deep concept to grasp. Having had this enlightening conversation with my Grandfather, it was like bringing me back to the past with him!
I grew to not only accept, but embrace the camera and film flaws. The white-washing. All the nicks and film glitches. The cool CinemaScope style, rounded picture instead of crisp corners. Not in every Chapter, but most. These little annoyances that would otherwise anger me on a new blockbuster movie, I was happy to see them here. It gave a genuine sense of old-fashioned realism to what the industry could offer. Surreal in many forms. Call me nostalgic. I am and proud of it. I love the high octane, big budget flicks as much as the next! This was the very reason why I couldn't watch this in my first two attempts. You know, expectations?
I hope this honest review reaches out to the true fans of the Original Batman as Bob Kane intended him to be! Happy watching, enjoy yesteryear!",1391644800,101,17749,4.656439757110898

I've enjoyed the fun of watching on the little screen what I saw on the Big Screens of movie theaters.  To some, they may be cheap and hokey, but to a kid of 5 to 8 years old, they were the real thing.  At that time, a 49 Lincoln wasn't a classic yet, Batman and Robin were real, and we cheered when the bad guys got their come-uppances.  If you like the 30's and 40's serials and movies, this one is for you.  Oh by the way, that's a 40's RECOMMENDATION to purchase, watch and really enjoy life!",1478995200,,606,4.136752136752137

If you are a Bat-Man fan these are a must have! If you live in LA, you might even recognize various areas around here, for instance, I didn't know Chatsworth and stoney point is so close to Malibu...

Batman first foray into film was as 2 movie serials made in 1943 and 1949 the first one is full of WW2 stuff and attitudes but holds it's comic origins intact good action moves this serial through the chapters quickly. 1949 sees a differint Batman this one was produced by Sam Katzman a legend in hollywood for cheap and this serial shows it. Still there is much to recommend this serial also once again fine action and a comic like story with a villan known as the Wizard help make this a fun time.
If you have not ever seen a serial you should start here and have fun with Zombies and remote control devices from the 40s same things are enjoyed on film today!",1432252800,2,709,4.220588235294118

6162162,5,B00HFWETQW,"Let me say first that I'm glad to add these serials to my collection. I read some reviews and comments before I spent my money. One person commented that these serials were not remastered. I haven't found that to be true at all. Mill Creek's treatment of these movies look just as good as the dvds released by Sony/Columbia Pictures about 10 years ago. If you think they look bad now I wish you had seen the vhs tapes released by Goodtimes Video in 1989. Talk about lousy quality! Those videotapes were the lowest of the low! Anyway let's move ahead now. Batman(1943) stars Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft as Batman and Robin battling Doctor Tito Daka played by J.Carroll Naish. The setting is ww2 so you can guess what the story is all about. I won't spoil it for anybody. On the tech side there are a couple of minor flaws with chapter 2 we should discuss. When Daka's men phone Linda to arrange a phony meeting with her Uncle Martin the scene plays ok. Then  Linda calls Bruce to tell him about finding her uncle. After she hangs up the phone the scene flashes back to Daka's men in the phone booth for about 20 seconds. Did anyone else notice this? At the end of chapter 2 we don't see the previews for chapter 3. As we see in chapter 3 none of the film is left out. But why did these things happen? Batman and Robin stars Robert Lowery and Johnny Duncan as the caped crusaders. They battle the wizard who has a remote control machine which he uses to control all of the traffic in Gotham City. Both serials are ok for their time. But they don't compare with superhero movies of today. They were products of their time period and that's how we should judge them.
Lastly let me say to customers who were upset because they thought they were getting something else. Please read the label before you buy. It tells you very simply what you are buying. If you still don't understand ask someone else what is a movie serial. If you decide to buy it I hope you enjoy it.",1428710400,7,1966,4.342391304347826
6162163,5,B00HFWETQW,This is a brilliant serial collection. I got this DVD in the post today and it plays perfectly on my multi-regional DVD player at home.

6162170,4,B00HFWETQW,"This is a double disc package with cliffhangers from, I'm guessing, the 1940's. The back of the case reads that they were made in 1943 and 1949. If you like long black and white move cliffhangers, then you will like this double disc outing. The Batman was a bit chubby and the Robin reminded me of Bud Bundy from Married With Children.  He appeared to be about 14 years old, yet he drove their car much of the time. The Albert character was down right stupid. If the boy wonder was not driving the ordinary 40's car, then Robin was.  The duo for the most part changed from Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson to Batman and Robin in the crowded back seat of that car. They didn't have a Batmobile and Batman's costume looked like it was made out of wool and Robin's boots looked a little too big for him.  But the 15-20 episodes were made for the 1940's generation movie goers. It is still likeable and I have to admit that I cannot remember the exact number of cliffhanger episodes, because I dosed off during the last five or so. If you can't get to sleep some night I recommend that you plop in one of these discs. They are great adult babysitters.",1423353600,,1143,4.306976744186047

6162173,5,B00HFWETQW,"Based on the technology available to producers and directors in the 1940's, I give both of these movies five stars.

A few people might object to racial insensitivity that is present in the 1943 serial. For example, Nipponese was what the Japanese apparently preferred to be called in 1943, and ""Jap"" was considered to be an insult, even offensive. There might be worse racial epithets in the serial, but I did not notice them. Thank goodness that we do not treat our Japanese brothers this way today.

This is not Adam West's Batman, nor is it Burt Ward's Robin. The 1943 Serial might represent the only time that a child actor played Robin. Douglas Croft was 16 when they were filming, 17 when the film was released.

I could easily imagine the ""Whack"" and ""Thwap"" and other colorful words during the fight scenes which looked so similar to Adam and Burt's fight scenes other than the missing words.

There was no special batmobile. The Wayne limo became the batmobile by the simple expedient of putting the top up. Alfred also drove the ""batmobile."" I vaguely think that Robin drove it once.

Batman's work area in the cave was a wood desk, about the only furnishing in the ""Cave"" which also had a cell appropriate for holding criminals until they could be delivered to the police.

This is definitely ANCIENT. But for their times, they are great. I'm 63, but in my mother's young adulthood, there were weekly serials that preceded the regular full-length movies. Back then, before the age of television, they'd have a cartoon, and a newsreel, and one chapter of a serial before the main feature. Each chapter would end on a cliffhanger, someone would be in danger.

Adam West and Burt Ward honored the memories of getting into traps every Wednesday evening, and get out of the traps on Thursday evening.

I am not going to go into detail on the plot, other than to tell you that there were 14 cliffhangers, one per chapter; one each week. Some of these were traps; others were the danger already happening, like falling down to the street, a certain death.

These (along with the Kirk Alyn Superman serials) are excellent examples of theater serials. I highly recommend them, so that you can see the type of superhero movies that your grandparents or great-grandparents used to watch.

However, keep in mind that there are some issues with the transfer quality with the '43 disc, which is reminiscent of the quality of their budget packs.. The early chapters have contrast and resolution problems, which make the picture have a washed looked, especially with the brighter parts; the contrast problem gets a bit better as the chapters progress, but the lower resolution stays fairly consistent throughout, though it can vary from chapter to chapter and scene to scene. The '49 disc has a much better transfer quality with no contrast problem and a consistently higher resolution. The sound quality of both are discernable and loud, though some buzzing and crackling can be heard at times on the '43 disc..

8632565,5,B00HFWETQW,"First off a little backstory-these serials were reportedly always tough to find because of being out of print. Nevertheless I saw vhs copies occasionally when I was a kid. So I always knew about them. But at the time I was more into the 1966 show and movie. Flash forward years. As I grew my interest in Batman developed more toward the comics character than the camp crusader. I eventually ran into these again completely by accident at the local Wal-mart and bought them on the spot. This would be my first time seeing them

The review-I watched these telling myself if I didn't like them I'd throw them out. Well what I saw was aged and dated (that is not a complaint just a fact) but I found that the characters were well handled without the excessive camp of the '60s show. A product of it's,time yes but still worth it. And as for the anti-japan sentiment some people complain about. It's history and it's a good
15 part film. I'm not going to complain that it's not pc",1511740800,,975,4.416666666666667
