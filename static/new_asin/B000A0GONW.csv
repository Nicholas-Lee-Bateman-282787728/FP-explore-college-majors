2344768,4,B000A0GONW,"Well, all very interesting. About the DVD itself, watch out. It only has episodes 2-5. This means that I will probably never see episode one of this series. But, oh well.

Since that's about all there is to say for the DVD, let me talk about the show. Though it seemed that this would be a continuation from energon/armada, it really isn't. In the show they never say so, and too much would be unresolved. It seems that it is a series unto itself.

From all the transformers I've seen, this series is really good. Compared to the 2 before it, it is outstanding. It makes sense, and it's cool. Finally, there is a series where Megatron can kick Optimus's butt! The animation is an awesome touch, and though the illustated shows are cool, it's nice to have another one since Beast Wars.

The shows have a cool plot. The Autobots need to collect the four Cyber Planet Keys (as Optimus laboriously states in the opening song every weekday) to close the black hole. Megatron wants them to gain power and rule the universe.

The four on this disc are good, being that they set up the whole plot for the series, but are drastically missing episode one. But who cares, they were cool enough for me to get it.",1128556800,15,1200,4.4409090909090905
2344769,2,B000A0GONW,"This dvd set, ""New Beginning"" is anything but the beginning of the series.  It's episodes 2-5.  Why they would do this, I have no idea.  It makes no logical sense to me.  I ordered it because Cartoon Network Started with Episode 3.  Which also makes no sense because the first 2 setup the entire series.",1126742400,25,303,4.4363636363636365
