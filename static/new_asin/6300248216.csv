275950,5,6300248216,"Controversial and elusive, The Quiet Earth may be the most unique 'don't mess with mother nature' flick I've seen. A man wakes up to find himself alone on a suddenly silent earth. The first half of the flick delivers the best and most memorable moments as Zac Hobson, a scientist involved in multi-national energy experiments, struggles with his sudden solitude. He goes through the emotional rainbow from elation to despair. The film kind of goes into another direction with the introduction of another survivor: a woman named Joanne. Their time together is bliss making solitude easier to deal with while they both investigate the cause of the effect. During this time Zac, in flashbacks, describes project flashlight. An experimental energy grid that surrounds the Earth: aircraft would draw energy from this grid so they would never have to land. Problem is, when 'Flashlight' is activated, it annihilates every living thing. Soon, the anti-protagonist arrives: Api, a huge Maori soldier with his eyes on the girl. She spends more and more time with Api as he works to be the last man on earth she ends up with. Throughout the film, Zac never ceases taking readings and measurements. He finds that the sun has become brighter and may be on an inevitable course of self-destruction. A couple of effects do take place. One particular event shows Api walking through walls ending up walking on the ceiling then on the walls before materializing on solid ground in another end of the building. Each time an event happens, the sun pulsates longer and shines brighter. No doubt hastened by their experiments. One of the creepy revelations is the connection the 3 of them have and why they may have survived: they were all at the moment of death. She drops a hairdryer in a bathtub full of water, Api is being drowned by a former 'mate' (in flashbacks, we see his assailant vanish from on top of him during the event) and Zac, well we meet him in the very beginning of the film; the empty pill bottles on his night stand should give you a hint of why he survived. The ending is utterly fantastic. It's an incredible visual effect and quite possibly what saved this movie from obscurity: it's gorgeous sci-fi cover. As the cover implies, this is a cerebral sci-fi flick. Not very hi-tech but what limited resources are used, the story is told unimpeded. This is a classic film for the sci-fi buff, and a must see for you end of the world story lovers, like me.",1137888000,5,2456,4.740654205607477
275951,5,6300248216,"OK, 4.5 stars, only because the special effects haven't aged well.  This is a stunning film.  It's about a man who awakes to discover that he is alone.  Completely alone.  There are no birds, no animals, no humans.  Or are there?  Is he truly the last man alive?  What caused this catastrophe?  How did he escape it?  Watch this movie to find out.  Unfortunately, in the US, it is impossible to find this on DVD.  Lucky for me, I happened to find it on tape at a garage sale.  I have ""forced"" nearly all my friends to watch it.  The start off by scoffing, but end up amazed.

275952,5,6300248216,"Although I do wish I could get a copy on DVD here in the states (hint, hint) I wanted to share my thoughts with those having a look here.
A vivid look into one man's nightmare and awakening, but also a haunting commentary on the dangers of science without a conscience. Masterfully blended in a raw and unadorned style which makes the characters seem more alive, more real, for the lack of Hollywood glitz and glamor. No ""B"" movie here. Truly a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours. And a film that will have you scratching your head and wondering about a great many things for years to come. After roughly 15 years I still consider this movie on a regular basis.",1088035200,46,667,4.387096774193548
275953,4,6300248216,"4.5 stars.  Australian Science Fiction has never been widely distributed nor marketed widely in America.  With the occasional, rare exception, such as ""Pitch Black,"" most people think all Australian films are invariable linked to ""Crocodile Dundee.""  This story starts off with a man waking up to find all the people in the world are gone.  While he is alone there are some unnerving and even blasphemous scenes showing his mental disintegration through isolation.  I recently had a collegue mention that Man is a social creature, and that if any one man was all alone in the world he would eventually crack-up.  This discussion reminded me of this under-appreciated film that, for some reason, is not available on DVD in the United States.  Bruno Lawrence is excellent as the main character, showing both mania and depression with equal intensity; but eventually he embraces his future, albeit with a somber countenance, only to discover that he is not alone and for very macabre reasons.  The first time I saw this movie I absolutely loved the ending, which is both fantastic and reasonable.  All in all, this is must-see, intelligent Sci-fi.  Thank you.  EDIT:  Apparently, this film is from New Zealand.  (picky-picky, people)  Also, it is now currently available on DVD.  Yeah!",1082937600,52,1282,5.0669856459330145

276049,4,6300248216,"This film is a cult classic which gets raves on many film sites from its devoted fans. I've wanted to see it for years and had always been intrigued by the film's poster and newspaper ad (seen here on the DVD box), which plays a significant role in the film.. Perhaps I went with expectations raised too high, but though I liked it, I did not think it was a hidden masterpiece. I won't be giving anything away by saying it is a ""last man on Earth"" kind of film, of which there have been more than a few. I've never found this anything to cause me to think much about since it's quite unlikely to say the least and I don't think the concept offers much in the way of philosophical speculation. As the film presented it I thought the main character, Zac Hobson, overreacted a bit too much, but that's just my opinion and a person might well have reacted as he did.

MINOR SPOILER HERE:Released in 1985, The Quiet Eart plays more like one of those pre-Star Wars early 70's Sci-fi films that were more about presenting a speculative concept than the action films they have become. It's a very quiet film, well, it would have to be, wouldn't it, with a very small cast. The drama, such as it is, moves from a single man's attempt to understand and come to grips with the situation to interpersonal drama when two survivors join him. From that point it becomes a fairly predictable human drama until a new danger threatens. The main character is well-acted by Bruno Lawrence, who has to carry much of the film by himself and who is a very ordinary-looking, balding, middle aged man. The film opens with a frontally nude shot of him in bed which I could have done without.

There are no monsters, mutants or zombies for a change and none of the usual post-apocalyptic gangs in bizarre costumes, gun-toting warlords or cannibals either. For that I'm thankful though more action oriented fans will find the film unbearably slow without any big enemies to deal with. Though there's nothing overtly supernatural, the ""science"" here is a totally imaginary plot device and might as well have had a supernatural cause.

I was left with this question: Would it really have been easy to find a life-sized cardboard stand-up of Hitler in 1980's Wellington?",1489017600,2,2239,4.5785536159601
276050,4,6300248216,"Decades before post apocalyptic stories were a dime a dozen, it required some imagination to visually capture the quietness, mental anguish, and worry of having to survive without help or advice.  It just happens that the main character has some special awareness and education regarding what really happened and what his future may hold.  The gradual formulation of a plan and unusual execution of it holds the audience's attention.  The last few seconds is both perplexing and satisfying somehow.  The only reason I subtract a star is that the scientific quest is either insufficient or unnecessary, depending on whether you wanted a cerebral or surface level survival story.  I would recommend the 2012 film ""The Wall"" for an even more haunting perspective on the sudden disappearance of civilization.",1488758400,,804,5.25

276054,4,6300248216,"I am always wary of ""cult classics"". They can typically be amazing or amazingly bad. I think Geoff Murphy's highly personal take on End of Days (precipitated by the Evil Corporation) is somewhere in between, more on the Amazing side, but maybe not a masterpiece as some have proclaimed it. Bruno Lawrence plays a scientist/researcher who awakens one morning to find that, apparently, he is the only one left on Earth, due to the catastrophic failure of an Energy Project he was working on. Or, is it something else? Speculation about the meaning of the The End of the film -- which has run rampant, apparently -- seems to tie together with the meaning of the Beginning of the film. It all relates to something called ""The Effect"" which has possibly wiped out the entire population of the Earth, except for Lawrence's character. The rest is worthy of saving for those that haven't seen this nifty Apocalyptic Sci Fi drama. In any case, I write spoiler-free reviews. What I will say is that Lawrence is wonderful in a role that requires an Actor's solo acting chops to be on display, as they were (in spades) for Will Smith in I am Legend.

276203,5,6300248216,"I too very much liked the movie.  I'll not recite again what it's about.  What I will say is that it is one of the better apocalyptic films I've seen.  Most films in this genre tend to focus on brutality and mayhem, Mad Max as just one example.  This film is not like that.  It presents a plausible reason for the catastrophe if you don't take it literally and consider it metaphorically, basically a science project gone wrong.  It's a thoughtful look into a situation that we can only guess at how we would react if we woke up one morning to find we were the last man or woman on earth.  I think it hits close to what I think how the reasonable and rational of us might react: denial, madness, acceptance, survival.  The line where the main character says, ""I thought I would be okay with this because I've always enjoyed being alone"" or something along those times, especially hit home with me.

I liked this film, I like the story, I like the possibilities it presented, and I like the ending.  It seemed to represent a possible real outcome to a hypothetical reality we can only guess at.  I found this film to be interesting, thoughtful, with characters I cared about.  The acting is good and the scenery of New Zealand inviting.

276243,4,6300248216,"""Fitting within the post-1984 zeitgeist, the relatively quiet and subtle-mannered sci-fi drama, The Quiet Earth, was surprising, intense, challenging, funny, provocative, and quirky all at once without even trying to be. I would have never heard of this film if it was not for browsing over my 1001 Movies to See Before You Die book.

What intrigued to the film was that there would be some social commentary hidden within the narrative that I might find intriguing and that was there on some level but not as much as it could have been. As a whole, it came across much like an onion that you have to peel off to find its peculiar layers. Many intriguing moments are present in the film like when Zac Hobson, our front-and-centre and sometimes disturbingly funny main character, having an egotistical crisis in the beginning and the scenes where the three only characters in the film are talking and living off the lonely land. Much of the scenes are a little difficult to decipher and that is possibly due to the fact that the ending is implicit about its objective (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!), whether if Hobson will keep on surviving by a new peculiar planet he discovers after his supposedly second death or his science affecting his selfish delusions and jealousy? (END SPOILERS).

All-in-all, it makes for thought-provoking viewing and Hobson played by Bruno Lawrence, Pete Smith, and Alison Routledge give neat performances as bewildered strangers, not vicious psychopaths or cliches you would find in an average, outlandish sci-fi film of this kind like 28 Days Later, I Am Legend, or The Day the Earth Stood Still. They feel like real people yet their surroundings are surprisingly complicated. The minimalism and grunginess of its parts and added to it the lovely-looking location sights of New Zealand (including a Maori reserve), not Australia, all are compelling and create a sense of wonder not found in its British or American counterparts. I am still glad I had the chance to view this film without much preexisting knowledge since it opened my lens a little bit but, as a result, restricted it not knowing what I just saw and got.

It is simple yet complex but it is Lawrence's performance and Murphy's drive to challenge viewers with pseudo-scientific horrors, loneliness, sex, ethnic relations, and megalomania that all make the film stand more inline with art-house fare. For a film studies case, The Quiet Earth is nothing to shy away from and might fit those who like to watch their films on drugs. It is a well-worthy treat, a mild 15 or R-rated film (mostly nudity and a sight of a crucified Christ getting shot) and a study in New Zealand more breathtaking than the Lord of the Rings films (he-he-he) and the first 30 minutes steal the whole film.""",1381104000,2,2768,4.860169491525424

didn't understand some things in the film. I think more interesting things should have happend.

Picture quality: 3.5/5

Looking at the comparison at ""Caps-a-Holic.com""
You can see it's better than the best DVD release (Anchor Bay). The film has an average of 17.99 in bitrate.
Despite the film being in 1080i50 and only taking up 11.89 GB,i think it looked reasonably good.
I have seen Blu-ray films with worse picture quality. Yes, this does problems with the
film grain looking more like noise and some compression problems, but i must say it didn't bother me.

I am pretty sure Koch Media used an older HD master that was used on HD channels on TV. That's why i believe it
doesn't have pristine quality and it's in 1080i50, which is the format used on HD channels in Europe.
I was glad i didn't listen to other people who said it had very poor picture quality.

Audio quality: 3.5/5

The audio quality wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. Though, the dialog was mixed a bit low the music too high.
Not much to complain about. There is some surprisingly good Stereo separation for an older film.

276268,5,6300248216,"I saw this as a kid, and again recently.  For the era, this is really well done.

The movie itself focuses around three people, and a deserted landscape, both urban and rural.  There's a slight inconsistency in some of the abandoned vehicles, etc, but overall, its pretty well done.

It has a little bit of a 2001 feel.  A moderate amount of the film is designed to let you feel the impact of what it would be like to survive everyone on Earth disappearing, and then to find you were not alone.  In this regard, the film does really well.

The audio tends to go from very quiet to very loud, so as usual, I recommend subtitles.  Also, I wouldn't watch this while people are sleeping, as it will surprise you a few times.

There are a few lightweight sex scenes, frontal male nudity, female breasts and backside, so it's not an appropriate movie for pre-teens without some parental editing.  Really, those scenes could be trimmed or edited out pretty easily for a more PG movie.  As it is, I'd say it borders on PG-13, as it's not a whole lot of nudity, but the scenes are there.

Even edited, it wouldn't really be suitable for young kids.  There are scenes of people fighting, and some general insanity that would be difficult for really young kids.  What am I saying?  People take their young kids to PG-13 and R movies all the time...  *sigh*

Anyway, the science aspect of the film is fairly decent, though it's kept vague enough to keep from fighting the details as technology progresses in real life.  While the electronics and computer technology look dated, it seems appropriate to the context, even now.

The conclusion is not definitive, in that the exact terminus is not explained.  This is okay, as it leaves you with some wonder, and contemplation after the movie without feeling unfinished.

I highly recommend this movie, mostly for the powerful psychological journey the main character traverses.",1358294400,,1912,4.681681681681682

With all that, I could believe it while I watched it and was intrigued to again go over the scientific details of what was happening.  Truly an excellent scifi viewing experience.

A plain man wakes up and finds himself mysteriously alone.  After looking around, he begins to give vent to his fantasies, which is at time hilarious and sad.  All the time, he is seeking to solve the mystery of what happened to everyone.  As it turns out, he is a scientist, so can ask the right questions and apparently was involved in some experiments that have a direct bearing what happened.  He discovers that many scientific constants appear out of whack, such as the precise electrical charge of an electron, which he observes is oscillating unstably.  These are ominous portents that play in the background, adding to the tension of scifi what-ifs.

He is not completely alone, when a delightful young woman finds him and they begin a relationship while looking for others.  When they meet another man, their chemistry is disrupted, revealing more about the lonely scientist.  It adds a great deal to the story and advances the plot.  The ending is splendidly ambiguous, leaving a lot to the imagination.

276270,5,6300248216,"After all these years, ""The Quiet Earth,"" if anything, seems more powerful than ever. I thought it was a terrific film when I first saw it, sometime in the early 1990s after stumbling across a VHS copy -- I'm almost sure I rented it from National Video, in fact. After finally acquiring it on DVD some years ago, I have watched it several times, and it never fails to make me marvel at the quality of the filmmaking and, more significantly, the mysteries of the universe and the very nature of what we call ""reality.""

Zac Hobson is a scientist in New Zealand, one of a group that has been working with American scientists on some kind of secret project with military overtones. It's never entirely explained, but it seems to have something to do with energy fields and, more specifically, a power that can affect time and space itself.

Hobson wakes one morning to find he's apparently the last human being on Earth. The scenes in which he reacts to this are masterful. We see him indulge in extreme narcissism, grandiose delusions, fits of despair. Mostly, what he finds out is that being the last man alive is a curse.

Then he finds he's not alone after all. He first meets Joanne, a very attractive young woman, and they begin to forge a relationship. But Edens never last, do they? They soon meet Api, a huge Maori tribesman; Joanne is torn between the two men but seems to prefer Api's more intuitive acceptance of their changed world to Zac's ongoing preoccupation with the fear that something even worse is going to happen -- a more pronounced repeat of what Zac calls ""The Effect"" that apparently wiped out most of human life.

Based on Zac's observations, the three of them decide to take action involving one of the facilities that was involved in creating the first Effect. Zac then deviates from the plan, resulting in ...

... Resulting in one of the strangest, most beautiful, most enigmatic scenes I've ever witnessed in a motion picture. It is simply beyond anything I could have imagined for the conclusion of this film or any other, and it deserves to be seen without my telling you any more about it.

I've discussed it with like-minded friends and we have kicked around many interpretations, none of which seems entirely satisfying. But that's the great thing about this film; like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" it forces you, the viewer, into taking at least some responsibility for assigning meaning to the proceedings.

The DVD copy isn't easy to get these days, but I would recommend buying it from a third-party seller here on Amazon. You'll be glad you did. Meanwhile, I will keep hoping the powers that be will release it on a Blu-ray disc that can be played on U.S. machines. I'd love to see it in in high-def.

Finally, I have to comment on the acting: All three principals deliver excellent performances. Bruno Lawrence as Hobson gets the most screen time, but Alison Routledge's Joanne and Pete Smith's Api are just as well-drawn and believable. Unfortunately, neither Routledge or Smith has worked in the last half-dozen years or so that I can see, and Lawrence died of lung cancer in 1995; he was just 54 years old.

""The Quiet Earth"" is a must-see for any fan of thoughtful science fiction.",1344902400,2,3222,4.688495575221239

276272,4,6300248216,"The umbrella term of 'Post-Apocalyptic' has the potential to cover a surprisingly broad range of films, anywhere from the violent, mindless savagery of warring survivors to calmer, reflective films such as A QUIET EARTH.  Technically, I suppose this film really falls under the 'Last man on Earth' genre, one that is seen sometimes as a small subset of science fiction writing, but doesn't generally hold up as well as a film due the lack of visual action.  Regardless, the overall point that I'm trying to make is that whatever catchword is used to describe it, A QUIET EARTH is more an introspective film rather than escapist or cautionary.

Zac Hobson wakes at 6:12 AM, and though nothing seems different at first, he is soon to find out that, from what he can tell, he is the last person in Auckland.  This first third of the film, where Zac goes from bewilderment, to indulging in his every whim, to grief, to near-total madness and then pulls back from the edge is easily the best part.  I think the filmmakers were quite adept at presenting this situation, and Bruno Lawrence, as Zac, makes it entirely believable.  But that very acceptance by the audience is contingent on the story advancing, which it does finally when Zac meets a young woman named Joanne.  Even here, I think, with the interplay between this new Adam and Eve, the film is still on track; Zac also happens to be a scientist, one involved with an international project (ill-defined but the details of which are not really that important) which he suspects caused the disappearance of the rest of humanity.

With the arrival of the third survivor - Api, a Mori man - the story takes a forseeable turn toward examining the sexual dynamics of the situation without really saying anything new.  It isn't as though the film becomes crude or that the social commentary isn't appropriate, but that the situation seemed to have more possiblities that what eventually crystalized.  This is something even the producer, Sam Pillsbury, suggests in an excellent commentary for this edition.

Yet the last scene in the film (literally as the credits roll) may make all that has come before irrelevant.  No spoilers, but whether it seems straightforward to you or comes as a headscratcher, there will definitely be room for each viewer to interpret the ending as they see fit.  I felt the ending was a very powerful image, enough so that from that alone I certainly recommend the entire film to science-fiction enthusiasts, especially those who enjoy films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B000HEBCZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solaris/dp/B004D6QCS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solaris</a>.  I don't think A QUIET EARTH is quite on the same level, but still worthwhile.

The film itself is in decent shape, though starting to show its age.  Little to complain about other than the film grain that dates the film back to the mid-eighties.  Presented in 1.85:1 - which is full screen for wide-screen televisions - and 2ch dolby, with a trailer and the aforementioned excellent commentary by producer Sam Pillsbury.",1330473600,,3253,5.347058823529411

Zac Hobson, a balding government lab grunt, wakes up one morning to discover every other human being on the planet has suddenly, spontaneously, vanished into thin air. Naturally the first place he goes is the office, where it quickly becomes clear that the project he'd been working on - a large-scale theoretical WMD - was successfully deployed while he slept. Given the quality and costs of special effects at the time, the film's decision to focus on the eerie aftermath is prescient, but for that kind of direction to work requires an engaging, interesting thread or two as compensation. Instead, this is basically an exercise in pointless wheel spinning. Like a kid in a candy store, Zac lives the high life for the next hour, aimlessly enjoying the remnants of society and doing everything he was too polite to imagine when the streets were still busy. Even the grand finale, in which he finally decides to get up and do something of consequence, is ultimately pointless and harshly under-explained.

As he sets out on a search for any other living soul, he begins to suspect that a project he was helping with may have been the cause of the mass disappearance.  He does eventually find two other people, but can they trust one another to survive let alone determine what happened to the human race?

This is a cautionary tale.  Not so much about Armageddon or an arms race that might bring it about, but a warning for people like me who often inculcate others with the phrase, ""What part of 'I hate people' don't you understand?""  Like any stereotypical geek, I'm not one for social interaction and often long for the sort of situation in which this film's protagonist finds himself immersed.  The problem is that before he finally encounters someone else, we watch him gradually go insane.  This is a fascinating statement on human psychology.  No matter how jaded, reclusive, or misanthropic we might feel, we do appear to need interaction with others of our species.  Without it, we seem to grow pensive and rather mad.  The irony here, at least in the case of this movie, is that when we finally do find someone else after prolonged separation, it doesn't take long for us to begin to mistrust them.  This is especially true here where the characters are two males and one female.  Jealousy, competition, and suspicion inevitably result.
This is a somewhat slow moving film, a rarity for a science fiction movie produced at the dawn of the post-Star Wars age.  It is thought provoking and refuses to leave its audience with a pat, Hollywood ending.  In fact I must warn you, the ending might even come off as somewhat confusing as it does not spoon-feed you its meaning.

Trouble begins when he soon realizes that he may well be the last human being on earth.  This concept of the Last Man has been done many times (THE WORLD THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL and FIVE) come to mind and the genre demands that the sole survivor must grapple more with retaining sanity than in finding a flush toilet.  Director Geoff Murphy makes it clear that the hold that Zac has on his mental equilibrium is a tenuous one.  He takes to wearing a lady's sleeping gown as he walks the deserted streets.  He puts up props of famous politicians like Hitler, Nixon, and Mao so that he can lecture them as the new President of Earth. We think that his descent into madness is the inevitable result of enforced loneliness, but we soon learn otherwise.  Zac is a scientist who performed a minor role in the Flashlight Effect, an experiment co-conducted with America whose purpose it was to create an airplane that could fly for extended periods of time without refueling.  Something terribly wrong happened and every human being on earth ""blinked"" out of existence.  Since the film shows no animals or birds, presumably all mammals followed suit.  His guilt drives him to near suicide.  Amazingly enough he meets two other survivors, whose respective tales of surviving are equally smudgy on details.  One is an attractive woman Joanne (Allison Routledge) with whom he soon begins an affair and the other is a Maori named Api (Peter Smith).  Although THE QUIET EARTH spends some minutes on the techno-babble of how the universal constant of the uni-directional movement of an electron has altered, the film instead zeroes in on how the survivors meet in fear, coalesce in unison, fall apart in bickering, then attempt to patch up differences in ways that are eminently believable.  The ending, which I shall not here reveal, is one that can easily be interpreted in various ways, not the least of which may be due to sloppy scripting or brilliant imagining.

The story concerns three characters (Old Smart Guy, Young Woman, Hunky Young Ethnic) that are the only three left in the world. The first, OSG, wakes up (in that cinema rarity, full frontal male nudity) to find that he seems to be the only person on a undamaged earth (except where planes crash etc). I mean the ONLY person, living or dead, as there are very few bodies or little piles of white dust or anything. There also appears to be no living things other than humans either, the earth is indeed quiet. OSG does the usual last man on earth things, looks for survivors, gets on the radio (sure to reach everyone who scans the police bands all day), gathers up useful and delicious things, gets drunk, makes speeches to cut-outs of famous people, tries on women's clothes, the usual. So far so good. Then YM turns up. OK. Not much happens as OSG investigates what happened, and YM investigates the empty stores. There is a little (very little, and that's good) sex segment with OSG in bed (another full frontal), and YM going bottomless behind her maid/nurse/whatever outfit (crotch gag goes here, comic relief?). Next, enter HYE, as he cunningly traps OSG at machine gun point but turns out to be OK after he sees YM soon after. (Good news: no automatic sex, no violence, no rape etc) Now we are on ""Five"" and ""World, Flesh and the Devil"" territory but not much develops. OSG turns out to have been a scientist involved in the program that did all this and he determines that the device involved will make it happen again soon. Perhaps you are wondering why these lucky people are still here? Turns out that being near death at the critical instant is the key. I am not impressed but at least it does go easy on the well-worn ""long tunnel into the light"" stuff. Action with trucks to get explosives to blow up the machine fills up the next few minutes. OSG goes forward to suicide bomb the building where the device is. So what else? (I guess the tension is just too much...) HYE and YM (finally) rip off their draperies for a little perfunctory leg-over (perfunctory apart from the interracial angle perhaps, another edgy element to complement the nudity?)just in case the world ends (as if Jay in ""Dogma"" HAD gotten his wish). OSG blows the thing up, lights flash, OSG is on a beach (is he On The Beach?) on a dark earth with a Saturn-like object in the sky looking much bigger than the moon.  THE END. What happened? Where did HYE and YM go?  Is the earth out by Saturn now? (If so shouldn't OSG be flash frozen along with the waves offshore?) Is Saturn near the earth? (The gravitational issues here boggle the mind) Is there any prospect at all of a future humanity?  Your guess is as good as mine.  In short we have another one of those ""leave it up to the viewer"", BS, cop-out, non-ending with what is supposed to be an impressive visual.

This movie is a major disappointment as it starts out looking like the real thing, meanders becoming neither really interesting, nor steamy, nor real trash to finally peter out into mush. No message, no moral, no point and nowhere near enough ""oh, Wow!"" to compensate with mindless entertainment for what is lacking as literature. It is mercifully brief at 90 minutes. It would have been REALLY annoying have sat through a ""Solaris"" sized epic for what this delivers.

The movie is based on a novel. I wonder if the novel is really much better but, as so often happens, not much more than its title got into the movie. (This was the case with the sorry movie ""Freejack"" ""based on"" the fine novel ""Immortality Inc"". In that case it was a spectacular car crash not a title that was only thing that made it into the movie.)

I recommend that you flip it once on Netflix if you must, but it is definitely no masterpiece and, for me at least, a long way from a keeper.  One star for looking good, one for not being pure trash.",1245283200,8,4322,4.458227848101266

How he came to be that last man is irrelevant, what's important is what happens to the man's psyche and later to the other two survivors and their relationships. Watching it now I feel that someone from New Zealand could interpret all the characters as being representations of the social politics amongst the races and sexes in eighties New Zealand.

That said, since that is a sub-subgenre of film (subgenre being Apocalyptic films in the genre sci fi), it's merely a good film overall, for it progressively gets weaker as it goes on, as do all films in that vein. Like most films in this sub-subgenre, it falls prey to tropes that undermine it- the first being the predictability of sexual or racial conflict (two for two), and the second being following the Dumbest Possible Action, wherein characters do really dumb things no one would do in real life, just so the film can move along.
  Of course, some slack must be given to films like this re: their scientific explanations for the depopulation of the world. In this film, it is ascribed to a Project Flashlight that the New Zealand government was working on in concert with the United States of America. It seems that a worldwide power grid was to be established via airplanes or satellites (it's never made clear- as it should be, lest the science bog down in irreality) and something goes wrong at 6:12 am, New Zealand time. The universe changes to the point that only those people who were near death at `the effect' survive. The rest all vanish- save a few corpses who were likewise near death, then died slowly afterwards. Perhaps it was a quantum shift in reality, but it's clearly a stand-in for nuclear power- something that New Zealand banned around the time of the film. A thin vein of Anti-American Big Brotherism thus hangs over the film.
The film owes much to prior Last Man films- such as the obligatory scenes of a shopping spree at a shopping mall (Dawn Of The Dead), the scenes in the church (The Last Man On Earth), sexual tensions between two men over the last woman (The Last Woman On Earth), racial tensions (The World, The Flesh, And The Devil), political brinksmanship backfiring (On The Beach), the Earth changed, but still the Earth (Planet Of The Apes), and there are also some great scenes unique to it- such as an airplane that seemingly fell from the sky and crashed into a building. But, the Dumbest Possible Action tropes- such as Api almost killing Zac in a car chase, or Zac simply not telling Api of Project Flashlight, and their shared assumptions that they alone are the survivors, is simply untenable- even if one suspends much disbelief. After all, if there are at least three survivors in Auckland alone, there would likely be dozens in New Zealand, and several thousand around the world- more than enough to repopulate the world; and worth seeking out. This is yet another unredeemed clich of the Last Man genre.
  Yet, despite all its flaws, I like this film more than I should, in relation to its artistic quality; possibly because in its flaws are the possibilities of what might have been a great sci fi film, in the hands of a better director with a better screenplay.

276413,4,6300248216,"The quiet earth is not a remarkable film (I give it a 3.5), but it does manage to capture both mood and feelings only present in a handful of other films.  The plot isn't much more than sci-fi mumbo-jumbo; just enough scaffolding to get to where the film is really trying to go: namely, what happens to the human psyche in total isolation, or in the company of only one or two other human beings.

With two males and one female, there is a thread of jealously, but it isn't over-explored; much is left for you to contemplate after the film has run its course.  Gender relations are brought up (though not so convincingly) as are race issues.  There is even a bit of paranoia (as you might expect being an 80's production), but like everything else, you're just given enough to want more.

The film ends in a way that may be to abrupt for some and dissatisfying, but to run longer may have been an artistic mistake.  Ultimately, the film succeeds at making you think about this situation, but as a movie there isn't enough action, conflict or even dialogue to sustain it for much more than its running length or to make multiple viewings rewarding.",1216684800,,1147,4.490384615384615

The message of this movie is not explicit, if there is one. That leaves it up to the viewer to conjecture a meaning, beyond the obvious.

How I got this movie was strange, in of itself. It was late 1987 and I was grazing my local video store. Slim pickings, to be sure. The guy behind the counter was restocking the Sci-Fi section and he handed me the box for ""The Quiet Earth"". It had come back two days early, so to me it was free. I guess it was a reward for not having ""Dune"" yet. I watched it in awe. Three times. My wife sat through viewings two and three.

There is something about this movie that grabbed me. As the events of the film move along, there is this atmospheric quality that builds. Like ""Field of Dreams"", if you buy in at a certain point, the reality works. I can't find a lot wrong with this movie; it just IS. There is no moment of Zen in this work, such as you might find in ""Soylent Green"" or even ""Blade Runner"" (contemporaneous works, more or less, or the shocking conclusion to ""Planet of the Apes""). Nothing like that here: it's all reality 101 in the 'Twilight Zone'. If for no other reason than that, this movie has a Rod Serling effect that jumps off the screen; it is as though the master had a hand in this project.

As you can guess, the eventual viewing of ""Dune"" was a major letdown. I own a VHS version of ""The Quiet Earth""; I am going DVD soon. If you are a Sci-Fi fan, don't ignore this work, if you've never seen it, lay your money down; if not, this movie might jusr convent you.

Bad Sci-fi movies are ten to a penny. This ranks right up there with the very best.

276445,5,6300248216,"When one thinks of New Zealand film making, one probably assumes that it was Peter Jackson that put them on the map - that he could be the only filmmaker out of that region.  Alas, one should realize that New Zealand has been releasing films for many years, and have even put their stamp on American cinema as well.  I recently had the opportunity to watch a little film that probably wouldn't attract too much attention today, but in 1985the rumor is that it was the second highest grossing foreign film in our country.  One can only applaud New Zealand for their creative effort, and for me, I will be applauding them for more.  ""The Quiet Earth"" was a fresh slice of science fiction delight.  It was a unique premise, based of a bestselling New Zealand book, that has seen several transformations in American cinema throughout the years.  Most recently I witnessed a mediocre adaptation in the film ""The Last Man"", but must express my excitement more towards this film due in part to the ability to grow the characters, the attention to detail, and expressionism of the unknown.  ""The Quiet Earth"" is one of those films that interweave religion, science, and human existence together so well that it will leave you lapping for more by the end.

To be brief, ""The Quiet Earth"" poses the question of what emotions one would feel if discovered they were the last man on the planet.  Would it be the hypothetical ""kid in the candy shop"" experience, or be driven to  the brink of madness due to boredom, or would one invest time in ones self - rediscovering why, who, and how the world transformed into the desolate Earth it became?  All great questions that are explored greatly by director Geoff Murphy and demonstrated through the ingenious acting abilities of one Bruno Lawrence.  It would be tough to handle the first act of a film solo, using no language outside of the sheer insanity of being alone, he gracefully pulls it of with ease.  In fact, it was the beginning act of this film that immediately grabbed me.  I could watch Zac (Bruno) over and over again as he engulfs himself in his new environment.  Just as we think we are about to loose him, others are brought into the picture, not as confusion, but as a moment of hope and inspiration.  While they seem threatening, Zac learns what he must do to ensure that they survive to rebirth the Earth - leaving us with an ending that makes us glad to have such a thought provoking genre.

I do not want to use this as a platform to compare and contrast this miraculous film and that of ""The Last Man"", though it was through the latter film that I was introduced to this one.  They are two separate films, and I will leave it as that.  ""The Quiet Earth"" will evoke laughter, tears, and at times, the genuine scare tactic to bring about the story.  Director Murphy does what I thought only Danny Boyle could have done in ""28 Days Later"" with empty streets, unpopulated towns, and streets as urban mazes.  While the tricks are simple, the effect is tremendous.  Again, I cannot state the Bruno Lawrence is amazing, both alone as well as his interaction with the others as they arrive.  Instead of focusing on lust, insecurity, and neediness,  he continues with his research to find a cure for the effect that he, or his team, may have brought to the world.  The concept of death playing a big part of their existence now is mind-challenging.  It really places a different perspective on ""where"" these survivors really are.  Is it the Earth that they once knew, or some parallel universe as seen in ""Sliders""?  Then, just as you think you know the answer, Murphy throws in the final moments of the film and any guesses that you may have are out.

The cinematography, besides what I said above, is amazing.  It really captures the film, and for the 80s budget pre-CGI, I have to applaud this team.  While listening to the commentary, the effects were done with no budget, but with imagination - something you find lacking when computers become too much of a staple to the film (ie see the newer ""Star Wars"" films).  The acting, as already said, is 1980s acting.  Sometimes wooden, sometimes stagnet, but overall exactly what I wanted from this film.  It fit the tone and  low-budget-y of the film, but it was perfect.  This is what I miss from films that were released in the 80s.  Sure, they didn't have the money, but they were creative and imaginative - a crucial feature I miss in today's cinema.

Overall, I must admit, that this is a film that will definitely be added to my collection.  It is one that I can watch time and time again, continually questioning the facts, the unknowns, and the opportunities.  Don't be afraid of 80s foreign films - they may surprise you ... greatly!

What if you were the last person on Earth, with an endless supply of everything, what would you do?

276491,3,6300248216,"The first 50 or so minutes of this film are terrific. The late Bruno Lawrence plays Zac Hobson, a scientist in New Zealand who wakes up one morning to find that everyone except him seems to have vanished from the face of the earth. We see him trying to cope with this state of affairs, going crazy and then slowly regaining his sanity while the world is silent around him. In these scenes, Lawrence gives a bravura performance which manages to stop short of hamming it up and really gets you caring about Zac's frail psyche. His descent and renewal are as gripping as any great moviemaking could be, done with only a few words, a few poignant gestures and deft editing and camerawork.

Zac then finds out that he's not alone after all: first, a young woman named Joanne and then a burly Maori lorry-driver named Api find him and the three of them try to puzzle out why they're still on Earth and everyone else has vanished. It's at this point that the movie gets pretty soggy. There's a rather flimsy plotline about how an experiment funded by the big, bad USA somehow brought about this catastrophe, a love triangle that comes about just when you're hoping a love triangle WON'T come about, and an ending that smacks of the story petering out, as opposed to leaving you with tantalizing unanswered questions. So that's disappointing. But the first 50 minutes of THE QUIET EARTH are right up there with the first hour of THE BLACK STALLION, where the director uses all of the cinematic tools at his disposal to help you experience Zac Hobson's despair fully and completely. That's worth the viewing in and of itself.",1167091200,12,1616,4.611111111111111

What I couldn't get over were the ghastley clothes from the 80s.  Strange, I know.  Three people are the le last o exist on the Earth and I worry about their attire.

276494,2,6300248216,"With all of the ""cult-like"" hype surrounding this film, I had pretty high expectations when I sat down to watch it.  Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed.

It started off cool.... wierd ( naked guy? ) but still cool.  The initial build-up kept me at least interested if not on the edge of my seat.  The problems arose when the film began to really plod along in the middle and didn't know what to do with itself. It's as if they ran out if ideas after all of the cliche ""last guy on earth stuff"" happened ( shopping spree, going a little wacko, etc, etc. ).

I got rather bored in the middle and was waiting for something to happen but nothing really did happen. Once the guy and the chick started hanging out, it got lame.  And NO, I wasn't expecting aliens, explosions, violence or any of that.  I'm 100% OK with drama, but the drama has to have some interesting points, backstory, or tension to make it worth while and this didn't.  Just another ""Last guy on earth that does everything you would do if you were the last person on earth"" movie.

And, the ending or entire concept of the film never really settled on anything. Apparently, there were strange natural forces at work here but unlike 2001 A Space Odyssey where sort of the same thing happend, this movie never even poised any questions or made you ponder about what actually bappened.  You didn't even care.  The ending was just ""ZAP"" and the guy was walking around by some new planet that looked cheesier than the worst Star Trek sets.

276495,4,6300248216,"Imagine this little mind-bending scenario if you will...you wake up one, fine morning, run through your normal routine, leave the house, only to discover you're the last person left on Earth...oh yeah, as if that weren't enough to tweak your melon, throw in the fact that everyone else on the planet has inexplicably disappeared, without a trace...based on a novel by Craig Harrison, The Quiet Earth was directed by Geoff Murphy (Young Guns II, Freejack, Under Siege 2: Dark Territory) and stars Bruno Lawrence (Smash Palace, Warlords of the 21st Century, Wild Horses), Alison Routledge (Bridge to Nowhere, The Returning), and Pete Smith (Pandemonium, The Piano, The Legend of Johnny Lingo).

Sunrise...the dawn of a shiny, new day...after three minutes of watching the sun coming up (along with the opening credits), we see a lone, balding man (Lawrence) sleeping in his bed (we later learn his name is Zack), sans any clothes (nekkid man alert), with an item strategically placed over his genitalia...thank the Lord for small favors...anyway, the man awakens at 6:12 AM (a key number) and proceeds with his routine.  Strangely, he's unable to pick up any chatter on his radio and a phone call placed goes unanswered...oh well...as he leaves his house (gee, traffic sure is light today), the realization begins to settle in there no one else around.  Not only that but it appears as if everyone has just vanished as if they were plucked from wherever they were, doing whatever it is they were doing, all at the same time (you'd think it was The Rapture coming to fruition, but if that were the case I'd expect a lot more people to be running around, at least a lot more non-Christians types).  The man finally arrives at a research facility (I'm guessing it's his place of employment given he has an I.D. card allowing him access), we learn of his involvement in some sort of global top-secret project called Project Flashlight...could this have anything to do with the current state of things?  Perhaps...so anyway, the man, believing he is the last person on Earth, goes through a number of phases, eventually falling into a deep depression (so much so he's ready to eat the barrel of a gun), but he eventually comes to accept his fate and pulls it together, just it time to discover he's not alone, as a red-headed woman named Joanne (Routledge) makes the scene...well all right...things are definitely beginning to look up.  After a time of contemplation, the pair decide to initiate a search to try an locate any others who might be around, and split up to cover more ground, Zack begins investigating the `event', and the possibility that the work he was involved with may have some global, even cosmic, ramifications.  Eventually the pair find another man (I should say he finds them), a large, hunky truck driver named Api (Smith)...Adam and Eve...and Api?  I guess the party's over, for Zack at least...an interesting dynamic between the trio develops, along with the revelation that the `event' which initiated the disappearance of nearly everyone on the planet may have only been a precursor to something else...

I really enjoyed this New Zealand produced science fiction feature despite finding certain aspects of it thoroughly confusing (perhaps I should have taken that college course in quantum physics instead of advanced basket weaving).  I guess I'm just used to films more often than not laying things out for the audience to avoid any real brain strain, but that's certainly not the case here as there's plenty of ambiguity to go around.  It's not that I mind being challenged by a film, but it just seems not many out there are willing to put their audiences to the test, at least in terms of mainstream features.  While I watched this alone, I'd suggest watching it with others as it will certainly initiate conversation after the film ends.  I thought the movie very well put together, and featured some very capable performances, especially in terms of Bruno Lawrence.  I actually enjoyed the parts with Lawrence by himself the most, especially the sequences where he went a little loopy and was running around a vacant city in a woman's slip brandishing a shotgun.  Eventually the others come into the picture, effectively disrupting the intimacy between Lawrence's character and the audience, but I suppose it had to happen, as I have yet to see a `last man on Earth' film that is truly a last man on Earth film (someone else always shows up).  I suppose I could relate to Lawrence's character the most, as Joanne was all weird and emotional while Api was just, well, weird, but then again, who knows how one might react when trying to come to terms with being the last vestiges of humanity.  I thought the reasoning behind why the three remained while everyone else disappeared was handled well, but as far as the actual fate of those missing, well, that's left to speculation (my bet is on a cosmic rift).  I thought it was pretty funny how Zack speculated on how the `event' came about, and that if it was due to the international project he was involved with, the fault that resulted in the occurrence was most likely caused by the Americans (you know us Americans with our `shoot from the hip' mentality...how could it not be our fault if'n given our invovlment?).  Since the story did eventually bring in a couple of other characters besides Zack, I would have liked to have seen a bit more in terms of the relationships and tensions resultant from the fact of there only being two men (one of them a minority prior to the `event') and one woman remaining, as it felt like some of this may have been glossed over.  Perhaps the novel provided more in terms of this, I don't know.  I feel I should warn some viewers the material can seem dry at times, especially if you're expecting an end of the world, post apocalyptic nightmare story complete with fleshy-headed mutants, as there's none of that here, but only an intimate, thoughtful, intelligent tale of three people trying to cope with the unexpected.

The picture quality on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) format, enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very sharp and clean, while the Dolby Digital Surround 2.0 audio seems a little soft and uneven at times.  Extras include an audio commentary track by co-writer/producer Sam Pillsbury, a theatrical trailer, and an eight page insert booklet with some liner notes.  One other aspect I should mention is the DVD comes in a very cool metal case featuring some beautiful cover artwork.

Other than that there's not too much going for what I found to be a rather dull film about three people coming to terms with their new situation.

276497,4,6300248216,"Update for blu-ray:

One of the best science fiction films from the 80's, ""The Quiet Earth"" arrives in a new transfer to Blu-Ray. The film looks very nice with improved depth and detail. Having said that, this isn't going to be a stunner like some bigger budget films. The upgrade is worth it but there is a major issue with not having subtitles.

Audio sounds really nice as well.

It's a pity that they couldn't license the audio commentary from the DVD that Anchor Bay put out five or so years ago as it involved the producer/cowriter of the script. While the commentary track is interesting it does have long lulls and periods where we just hear the action described on the screen. We also get the trailer and a booklet with an essay about the film.

Old review for DVD:

""The Quiet Earth"" came out of nowhere in 1985 to stun audiences with the story of a military project gone wrong and and a man condemned to a ghost world. Zack Hobson (the late Bruno Lawrence in a stunning performance)wakes up on July 2nd at 6:12 in the morning to a world radically changed. He dresses for work heads out only to discover there's no one else around. He sees dump trucks in the middle of dumping trash, cars left running, tea kettles whistling for owners that will never come. He discovers due to a malfunction in Project Flashlight a defense project he was working on that with the exception of him everyone everywhere has vanished.

To tell more would spoil some of the surprises in the film. The exact mechanism that makes a populated world into a ghost world is never really explained in depth but what we do see is the most important part--the human drama as Zak begins to lose his mind alone on a planet designed to comfortably support billions.
While the second half of the film doesn't hold up quite as well as the spooky firt half, it's still a memorable science fiction mystery thriller. In fact I suspect that movies such as ""28 Days Later"" borrowed from this thoughtful thriller as much as from ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"". In many respects everybody just vanishing is much creepier than having zombies running around.

Made in New Zealand for a paltry sum and based on a science fiction novel by Craig Harrison Anchor Bay gives us a great looking transfer of the film in a collectable tin box (similar to the one used for ""Dune"" and ""King Kong""). We also get a thoughtful commentary by producer/co-writer Sam Pillsbury (""Eerie Indiana"", ""Where the Red Fern Grows""). Anchor Bay also includes the original theatrical trailer and a 8 page booklet with an intelligent essay on other films with similar themes and how ""The Quiet Earth"" compares. Although I would have liked to have a featurette on the marvelous late Bruno Lawrence (""Smash Palace"") with clips from some of his other films not available in the United States, Anchor Bay has done a terrific job here. This is a marked improvement over some of the import copies which are bare bones. The most important part of ""The Quiet Earth"" is the film itself and the stunning performances.",1150243200,14,3063,4.609174311926606
276498,4,6300248216,"I remember seeing this film when it first aired on television during the '80s and was anxiously waiting for its release on DVD. Essentially a period piece, I agree with one review which labeled it ""the best Scifi picture of the 80s"". If you remember, the '80s was a period of high budget special effects ridden shoot 'em up monster scifi flicks. This was a thinking person's film. I won't go into detail, as that's done elsewhere. The ending scene is worth the purchase of the movie alone (did he die or was he transported at the moment of death into another universe?). All three (count 'em) actors do a good, if slightly workman like job. The main actor, I understand, unfortunately died shortly after making this film. The picture quality on my DVD was good. However, there were some problems with the sound (my copy?). The voices were low and the music blaring. Had to keep adjusting the remote. A small complaint, but enough to lower it to 4 stars. The bottom line - should you buy it? Definitely. It is a classic of the scifi genre, bereft of distracting Hollywood actors and an intelligent story line. It proves the axiom that IN GREAT SCIFI MOVIES, CREATIVE IDEAS TRUMP FLASHY SPECIAL EFFECTS EVERY TIME!

I first noticed the movie box in the video department of a food store at camp one summer, and the plot description caught my eye, but was unable to rent it. Fortunately, it was at a local Blockbuster store when I got home, and I then rented it and loved it. Lawrence, playing scientist Zac Hobson, awakes one morning and finds that all life on earth has seemingly disappeared, and he is the only person left. He makes the most of his situation before descending into a loneliness-driven madness, which is cured when he finds two other survivors, a pretty young lady and a Maori tribesman. They band together and try to figure out what happened to everyone else. Lawrence begins to suspect that a project he had been working on is to blame.

A vaguely-described experiment so that military planes could tap directly into the earth's ""energy grid"", from space, done on a massive international scale, instead appears to eliminate every person on the earth-except people at the moment of death. A fascinating character study at first via Bruno Lawrence and later as he meets two other apparently-alive people. What he alone discovers is perhaps the structure of the universe has been somehow altered, creating ""events"" which will, he believes eliminate him and the two other people left-unless a relay station can be blown up and perhaps stop the chain reaction. We start asking is the experiment responsible, or, as asked in the film is it simply a natural event? Are these people even on ""our"" earth or have they somehow been transported to some alternate universe, devoid of people? We never really know, and maybe that's a good thing.

Fascinating, scary and thought-provoking all at the same time. Very little is used in the way of visual effects, but what is done is quite effective, especially in the haunting last shot which in itself offers more questions than answers and will stick with you forever.",1148774400,3,1378,4.939655172413793

This movie isn't just about the ""last man on Earth"", it is about lonliness and reflecting the nature of man. Untimately, Zac Hobson goes on a journey of self-exploration. I don't know about other reviewers but that theme really hit the mark with me when I watched this film. I think that alot of people feel that they are on the ""Quiet Earth"" everyday of their lives and long to make connections with other people and explore who they are. Zac goes from being lonely, tortured and ultimately suicidal to being ""cleansed"" of his demons (hence the naked ocean scene) and sacrificing his life for others.

The ending is great and definately provides a forum for further discussion. I think the writer and director purposefully left it ambiguous so that you could take what you will from the film.",1148342400,2,1036,4.564516129032258

""The Quite Earth"" does a much more unsettling job of setting up the environment.  The streets really do look deserted.  Bruno Lawrence is simply great as a man driven to the edge.  It's a compelling film - perhaps the best of the ""last man"" story type.

The film - like most Sci-Fi - does falter when it tries to explain or reveal.  The movie works about 50% of the way so long as we're shown our lone protagonist wandering empty streets.  Some viewers will be left behind (heh) once the film shifts gears.

I think the US does have a HAARP array in Australia, they do have a bunch of antennas that may or may not be connected to HAARP there.

Two films (LAST MAN ON EARTH, OMEGA MAN) were made from Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND, and the scary short story ""The Deadly City"" was made into a passable 1950s film. This film had a video box that you'd probably pass over a dozen times at our local boutique, but I gave it a chance one night ... and was floored. The fresh, unleashed creativity here matched that of George Miller and Peter Jackson ... and just when I thought I had it figured out ... surprises lay in store.

I hope this comes out on DVD. It's no Grade A classic, but it was a very interesting take on a couple of common, perhaps overused sci-fi themes.
