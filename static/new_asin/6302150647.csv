430826,5,6302150647,"For the Love of Benji takes the world's most huggable hero all the way to Greece, but this wonderful Greek vacation becomes a nightmare for Benji even before he is loaded on the plane.  A bad guy drugs him and tattoos something on his paw, and when he finally get to Greece alongside his girlfriend Tiffany, he finds himself camping out in a storage area for misplaced baggage.  He manages to get out of his crate and escape, only to find himself lost and all alone in a strange new city - hungry, tired, and frightened, missing Tiffany and Paul and Cindy Chapman.  The bulk of this film follows Benji in his seemingly impossible search to find his family.  He searches in vain, becoming more and more depressed, but he does manage to make one new friend.  Still, he has to guiltily steal food in order to live, and if all that isn't bad enough, several strangers including that bad man who drugged him back in the airport are doing all they can to nab him.  Benji has risked everything to save his friends in the past, but now he has to use all of his intelligence and leg power just to keep himself alive while he strives valiantly to find and be reunited with his family.  There's an underlying storyline, of course, of the bad guys and their evil plot, but what really matters here is Benji.  The film builds up to a thrilling conclusion that almost equals the emotional power of the original Benji movie.
Some people may not know that the Benji of For the Love of Benji is not the same talented actor who starred in the original Benji movie.  Higgins, the original Benji, was fairly old when he made Benji a household name in 1973, and the role of Benji for this second movie was played by Higgins' daughter (who was actually named Benji).  Yes, this Benji is played by a female, but it does not matter.  What is obvious is that acting ability courses powerfully throughout the Benji bloodline, as this Benji gives a simply amazing performance, in some respects bettering that of her dad in the original.  There is much more action in this film, much of it taking place on the busy city streets of Athens; this little dog really has to run his legs off in this movie as well as navigate many obstacles and perform a number of actions that only Benji could do.  He also faces a menacing, large, unfriendly canine enemy and has to avoid a number of gunshots.  Most importantly, he has to show a wide range of emotions, as well, and this dog is truly an incredible actor.  When he is supposed to be frightened, he really and truly looks frightened; the guilt he feels over having to steal food is obvious; the forlorn look on his face as he searches in vain for his loved ones looks heartbreakingly real; and when he is supposed to stop and think about his next move, you can almost literally see the wheels of his mind turning inside his head.  Even the smallest and shortest of expressions - perking up at a certain sound, reacting to a smell, breaking out in excitement when he thinks he sees one of his family members - are performed with a level of skill few human actors could ever hope to rival.
I think the original Benji film will always be my favorite, but For the Love of Benji is not far behind.  Children will probably enjoy this film more than the original because of all the action scenes it showcases.  This Benji, just like her father Higgins, is among the most talented actors to ever grace the big screen, and I can't imagine my childhood (and don't plan on living my adulthood) without the presence of this greatest dog of them all.",1073088000,16,3554,4.441538461538461
430827,5,6302150647,"In the sequel to ""Benji"", kidnappers target someone else - Benji! As Benji tries furiously to get back to his family, and escape from his kidnappers, there some really great scenes. My personal favorite is where Benji grabbs a string of hot dogs and takes off down the street! This isn't as good as Benji, but it is worth watching anyway.",1037836800,2,338,4.557377049180328
430928,5,6302150647,"This is my favorite Benji film. This film takes Benji and his family to Greece where, of course, he becomes immersed in some crime story that turns him into a hero but that's not what makes this film great. What is especially moving about this film is how they depict his time lost and alone in a strange city, its really quite moving and raises the kind of compassion that makes you think of what life is like for the average stray, its this that the Benji's films do best. The real Benji was a shelter dog and these films do a great service reminding everyone how wonderful a shelter animal can be. Having two very small dogs myself I was quite moved by this film. Its a great family film.",1403654400,,691,4.282442748091603
430929,5,6302150647,Hadn't seen the original movie for 35 years or so.  Was as cute and family friendly as I remember.  Be sure to watch the original Benji movie before For the Love of Benji or it won't make sense.  Very happy.,1393200000,,207,4.125
430930,5,6302150647,"Following the success of the first Benji film, the producers came up with ""For the Love of Benji"" in 1977 that was also a hit.

 In this outing Benji is on vacation in Athens with his new family when, by accident, he gets lost. Secret Agents are pursuing him, he falls in love and at the same time takes viewers on a beautiful view of Athens.

 A big family movie, to me this is the second best film in the Benji series.",1392336000,,420,4.085365853658536
430931,4,6302150647,"This movie was pretty good, but it was a bit hard to follow and left a few things to be desired. For instance, I would have liked the Doberman to end up being a friend to Benji and become a ""drug-sniffer"" dog and for that ungainly mutt of a dog (Benji's pal) to end up living with Paul and Cindy too",1349222400,,299,3.918032786885246
430932,5,6302150647,"These two movies starring the dog from my childhood favorite TV series ""Petticoat Junction"" are passing the test of time with flying colors. It's not easy these days to keep your children entertained without letting them see the countless movies that feature terrific amounts of violence and sexual behavior. Back in the 1970's when these movies were first released into theater's there was no VCR or DVD home entertainment for the families on weekends or summer vacations. Parents used to drop the whole brood off at the neighborhood theatre for the double-feature. Tickets, popcorn, and drinks were affordable back then, you didn't need a $100 dollar bill for them to have a good time. I was a projectionist and theater manager and I did my best to get my owners to book all the G-rated fair that was available. We should bring those morals back for the young generations, it might make a better world in the future for them all.",1282694400,5,931,4.788819875776397
430933,5,6302150647,"Wow,I found this at K Mart for a measly $2.50,brand new!!! The films(Benji & For The Love Of Benji) are Full Frame transfers(they were probably filmed that way anyway!),and have adequate mono sound all on one single sided dvd from Gt Media,but that really doesnt matter with family films of this nature,as they were low budget films anyway! There are some familiar faces in these films though,the most unusual was Peter Bowles(A very underated British Actor mosly known for To The Manor Born and mostly recently his role on The Bank Job with Jason Statham!),other character actors also appear! Classic stuff indeed!!! A+",1234656000,2,620,5.029126213592233
430934,5,6302150647,My 2 yr old granddaughter just loves the movies Benji and For the Love of Benji.  She can tell my the music if Benji is happy or sad.  We have enjoyed watching them many times.,1224806400,2,176,4.0
430935,4,6302150647,"The camera is mostly kept at the height of the dog. You'll experience (late 70's) Athens like NEVER before - at about 2-3 feet off the ground! Watch it and you'll see what I mean. It's wonderful and truly unique.

My cousins are the little Greek kids running around in the ticket line at the Houston, Texas airport at the beginning of the film.

As a Benji adventure this one is so-so. Don't expect the same level as the Disney Benji movie. Might be too old (clothes/hairstyles) and slow moving (sometimes boring) for some kids these days.

The four stars are for the interesting/unique footage of Athens (camera at dog height).",1216944000,,628,4.63963963963964

430937,1,6302150647,"I am stunned by the other reviews. This movie is harmless and okay for the young and completely undiscerning, but really terrible in most aspects: story, camera work, editing, and acting. A previous reviewer compared it to Babe and that is truly unfair to Babe -- to its fine story, good acting, and sweet message. For the Love of Benji looks like a ten year-old made it with a video camera. About half of the movie is Benji walking back and forth.(I suppose they needed these shots to fill in for the plot that wasn't there.) However, these scenes are preferable to the incredibly poor acting of the human characters and the ridiculous, albeit mercifully limited, dialogue. If you want to rent something to show to a five year- old that you can walk away from and not have to worry about content, Benji is it. If you want to rent something you can actually watch with your kids without being completely stunned by its badness, watch Babe, Finding Nemo, Mary Poppins or any of the other dozens of truly good kids' movies out there.",1105315200,2,1031,4.578378378378378
