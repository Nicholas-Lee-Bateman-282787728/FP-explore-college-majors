Thanks to the back story in the previous 3 volumes, we now have more dramatic plot twists and less of the wondering, ""Who is this?"".  This is a much more in depth story than the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Athletes-Volume-One-On-Your-Mark/dp/B00000G3CR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Athletes Volume One: On Your Mark</a>, and even more humorous.

7895919,5,6305534179,"Battle Athletes Victory: Spaceward Ho!  is the fourth volume in the Battle Athletes Victory anime series.  This series is set way in the future and takes place on Earth and in space.  Akari Kanzaki is the daughter of a famous Cosmo Beauty.  Living in her mother's shadow has left her very insecure.  With the help of her friends, and her athletic rivals, Akari is becoming more sure of herself.

In Spaceward Ho, Akari is taking the space shuttle to University Satellite, when it is hijacked by some strange hijackers.  But will the hijackers be a match for the strange students?  Akari meets a girl named Kris who instantly falls in love with her and pledges her undying love.  Akari freaks out when she finds out that Kris is going to be her roomate and teamate as they try for the preliminaries.  Akari's other roommate/teamate is a shy girl named Anna.  Anna is like Akari when she first started.  Kris comes from a hippie culture with a laid-back lifestyle.  How can Akari rally her teammates to win?

I love this volume because the headmaster is such a total hunk.  I am so in love with him!  He also has some pretty amazing athletic ability - or is it something more?",1116979200,,1174,4.545454545454546
