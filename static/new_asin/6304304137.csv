7867962,5,6304304137,"""The Host"" is one of the best X-Files episodes ever.  Where does Chris Carter dream this stuff up??  Granted, this is not for the sqeamish, but there is no disputing this is an X-Files classic.  ""Little Green  Men"" is nowhere as good as ""The Host"" but still quite good.  All I can say is if you're driving through Newark, NJ late one  night...watch out...Fluke Man is gonna get you!!",918604800,2,383,4.478260869565218
