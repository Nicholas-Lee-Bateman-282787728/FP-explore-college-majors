8158595,2,B000KPRBXY,"This video best suited to those who maybe have not ridden much, while the information is good the voice of the author is quite annoying and can be found on several videos of people making fun of dressage riders. The horses and riders are nice,the information is good BUT  overall this video rates about as high as watching paint dry. I did not get as far as watching  the third in the series so it might get better,  My copy is going back online for sale.",1396569600,2,455,4.267441860465116
