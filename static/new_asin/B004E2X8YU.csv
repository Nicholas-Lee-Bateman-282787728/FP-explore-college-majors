8426426,3,B004E2X8YU,Originally saw the climatic battle scene as a video on YouTube.  Its one of those so bad its kind of good  fight scenes.  I laugh every time I see the robot swarm morphing into different things. I bought this to share with my office. Its one of those that makes geeks laugh and normal people just groan because it has a lot of cheesy dialog and cliche situations. Don't otherwise watch Tamil movies so I don't know if this is common for these kind of movies or not.,1361491200,,465,4.261363636363637

8426428,4,B004E2X8YU,"While I knew this movie was going to be pretty goofy, I was surprised by how very enjoyable it was. Get ready to put some time into this one. I think it was around 4 hours or longer. There are several dance/music numbers interspersed in the movie. If you enjoyed the quirky humor of Kung Fu Hustle, you'll like this movie.",1312588800,,322,4.295081967213115
8426429,1,B004E2X8YU,"Enthiran is the most expensive film made in India. It's a Tamil science fiction movie. I don't know why, but most sellers of Indian movies don't have a DVD of this movie. I wanted this movie very much since I like Indian movies and my preferred actress, Aishwarya Rai, is in it. Finally after waiting a lot I decided reluctantly to take a chance with a DVD produced by Sruthilayam and offered by a very few Amazon merchants. What have I got? Two movies for the price of one, since the second movie named Thillalangadi was not even mentioned in the details of the product. The big problem with that gift is that the two movies are contained on only one DVD and the total length of these two movies is 290 minutes. This is far too much for a unique DVD. With such an absurd compression ratio, it's the video quality that takes a sheer drop.  There's also another problem with the white subtitles. They're too small and hard to read. When the back ground is white they're almost unreadable. With the second movie there's no problem reading the subtitles since they're none. Sorry for the few people who are not fluent in Tamil. It's a shame to turn such a good and expensive movie into a piece of junk. If you want this movie and if you're concerned about quality, stay away from that trash version.",1296259200,52,1296,4.445378151260504
