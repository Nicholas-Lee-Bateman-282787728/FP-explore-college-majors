8529555,5,B008PSLSO6,"They saved the better one for later.  Nothing of Motorhead is going to be bad, but this show is more energetic than the Chile one & yes, I do enjoy it more in color (nothing against the first one).  Definitely the clearest DVD release so far from them in terms of video & audio.  Same setlist pretty much except it's great to see them do ""Bomber"" & bring out that huge lighting rig.  The Wacken crowd seems really into it.  Haven't really seen all the bonus features yet, but the snippets from two other shows don't have any songs not performed on the main content.  The other small item is a little Wacken tour w/ two Motorhead ""superfans.""  Highly recommended even if you own Volume 1 & an another great job done by Bangor Films.

8529556,4,B008PSLSO6,"Motrhead's The Wrld Is Ours - Vol 2 Anyplace Crazy As Anywhere Else Blu-Ray is a high definition visual memoir of the band's 2011 festival appearances. It is also available in a few different formats and combinations of formats such as on Vinyl or with 2 CDs and a DVD should you not be inclined towards Blu-Rays. The Blu-Ray version comes in a slim Blu-Ray case and comes with a booklet full of photos, but no linear notes.

The main feature of the video is the band's 2011 set at Wacken Open Air Festival in Germany. The set list is seventeen tracks long, with a mixture of material primarily from the classic late seventies-early eighties period and some newer material from post-millennial albums like Inferno, Motrizer and The Wrld Is Yours, as well as four or five tracks you'd expect from in between.

Visually, the disc is absolutely brilliant looking, with a great picture quality and a fine editing job. The shots stay on screen a fairly long time, all three musicians are given a good ratio of screen time each and there's enough camera movement and shot variety to keep it interesting. Also; for any fans who were upset when the band's previous live effort, The Wrld Is Ours - Vol 1, was released only in Black and White, it is notable that part 2 (this Blu-Ray) is in full colour.

The sound mix is quite good for a festival performance, and most of the music is fairly clear and well balanced (as far as Motrhead ever are, that is). It is available in either Dolby Digital 5.1 or Stereo.

In terms of bonus features there are 11 repeated tracks from two more of the band's 2011 festival appearances.

There are definitely complaints (pedantic ones, admittedly) that could be made about the fact that the bonus concerts are made up of the same songs as in the main feature, when you consider the sheer size of Motrhead's discography. But then again, they are still good bonus features to have, one, just becuase its there at all, two, just because of the sound and picture quality and three, because the mood of each of the performances is pretty different. It gives you a small insight into what a tour is like in a way, doing the same songs in different places under different conditions and getting different responses both from the crowd and yourselves.

For example, the Sonisphere footage (from their UK homeland) was filmed really soon after the death of their former guitarist Wrzle, and it gives the concert an entirely different sort of mood than the other two and Rock In Rio is in front of an absolutely gigantic crowd in a ridiculously large festival in Brazil, that gives it a more celebratory atmosphere (especially on `Going To Brazil').

The other special feature is footage of some fans walking around Wacken's festival grounds, but its not really worth your time in all honesty.

Ignoring your views on the importance of bonus features however, the main thing that stops it being absolutely terrific, is that the band's performance is OK. OK is not bad, by any means, but if something like a concert video is to acquire that must-have status the band usually have to be absolutely on-fire.

Some of the material here comes across as a little slow and un-energetic, probably most noticeably on `Iron Fist' and `Ace Of Spades.' Again, its not bad per say, just not as energetic as the raucous, out-of-control, rocket-fuelled performances of their past. Drummer Mickey Dee is pretty enthused throughout however, and delivers a fine drum solo on `In The Name Of Tragedy.'

Overall; If you want a Motrhead Blu-Ray then this is probably your best bet, since it looks and sounds good, has a solid track-listing and is available in full colour. Its a good Motrhead Blu-Ray for sure.

Its not exactly a stone cold must-have, since the performance isn't as electric as it could be and the additional footage isn't as diverse in track-listing as it could be either, but its certainly a welcome release for those inclined and worth checking out if you can get it for a fair price.",1349827200,2,4000,4.6918687589158345
