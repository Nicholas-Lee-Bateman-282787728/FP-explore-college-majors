274764,5,6300247589,"One of the best horror films of any age is the 1958 version of THE FLY.  What director Kurt Neumann has created is a film that includes the shock moments required of any horror movie, but to these moments he adds a disturbing montage of sight and sound that grab at the reader to yank him into the minds of the actors so that the viewer can see and hear the horror up close. Only the best science fiction movies can do this.
  The movie begins in a flashback when Francois Delambre (Vincent Price) discovers that his sister-in-law Helen (Patricia Owen) has been accused of murdering her husband Andre (David Hedison) by squashing his head in a compressor.  Her story forms the basis of the film.  She insists that she is neither insane nor a cold-blooded murderer.  Helen tells Francois that her scientist-husband Andre had been experimenting with a matter transportation device as in STAR TREK, but in this case, he had inadvertently allowed a housefly to enter the transportation chamber with himself.  The result of the experiment was a man with the head and arm of a fly and a fly with the head and arm of a man. Scriptwriter James Clavell of SHOGUN fame had apparently never heard of a pattern buffer that could allow for simultaneous transport of dissimilar DNA hosts.  What makes THE FLY click is Andre's reaction to his new form and Helen's acceptance of that reaction. At first, Andre is grief stricken, and tries to hide his condition from her.  He places a scarf over his head and keeps his fly-claw in his pocket.  There is no need for any fancy special effects here.  The simple use of a scarf is all that is required to generate suspense.  Later, when it is time to eat, Helen brings soup which he loudly slurps. This soup scene is one of a series of images that are all the more horrible for their morphed simplicity.  The viewer can nearly literally taste what life is like for a man/fly hybrid. Andre communicates to Helen by using his human arm to scrawl messages, leaving her puzzled and anguished over her inability to help.  She determines to see the face under the scarf and rips it off.  This scene is one of the two indelible unions of sight and sound that cause viewers to remember THE FLY as some surreal mixture of a paradoxical link of disgust with an unwillingness to turn away their heads.  As she sees Andre's head, the camera shifts perspective to Andre, who sees her as only a fly can: as a infinity of kaleidoscopic images of a screaming woman with each of an infinity of mouths howling an infinity of pain. Once she can gather herself together, she tries to help by recapturing the fly with Andre's head.  Since a fly's lifespan is quite limited, the only hope she has to regain her husband is to find that fly, an unlikely prospect at best. In despair, he asks her to kill him with that compressor.  She does so, and the movie reverts to the present with Francois discussing the case with Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall). Each is sure that Helen has gone quietly mad, thus legally preventing her from trial.  As Francois and Charas exit the house, the movie's second unforgettable grafting of sight to sound occurs when they see that a strange-looking fly has become entangled in a spider's web, and the spider, looking as large and ferocious as the monster in TARANTULA, looms ever closer.  The camera zooms on the fly which has Andre's head attached.  The viewer can see his eyes bug out as the spider approaches.  He shouts a squeaky HELP ME over and over, but Francois is too slow to react.  The spider kills the fly just before Francois kills the spider with a large rock.
  The horror of THE FLY does not diminish with repeated viewings nor can the later remakes and sequels detract from its suggestion that the most ordinary things in nature can change into something so terrible as to cause the audience to squirm in its seat and think that the weirdness on the screen is not so far fetched at all.",1027900800,4,3946,4.555240793201133

274766,5,6300247589,"This film is a good example of the classic science fiction theme of the 1950s. Man through his science takes experimentation of his environment one step too far.

The horror resulting from Al (David) Hedison's experiments gone awry are devastating and disturbingly represented in the film's images. Once seen, the viewer can never forget them.

274770,5,6300247589,"The original ""Cinemascope"" horror film. True horror because of the 'bad' ending. Better to show the wife insane at the beginning in the original than the Cronenberg girfriend at the remake's end. Our sympathies'  for the married man with a son who teleports for science, not for the  immature drunk who teleports himself because his girl's in danger of going  for some other guy. Really...horror films at their best are morality tales;  David's vision succeeds here in messaging: ""lay off  fornication!""...

274771,4,6300247589,"The film opens on the scene of a man who has been crushed in a machine and his wife said she is the one who pushed the lever, but something does not fit and her brother in law (Vincent Price) doesn't think she did it.  This  launches us into into a re-telling of how the women's scientist husband was  obsessed with a matter dis-integrater he was working on.  Something goes  wrong with his work and he winds up with a fly head and hand. Now his wife  is quickly trying to find the fly with her husbands head so that they can  put him back together.  This is better than the majority of science  fiction during the 50's because the story tries to  focus on the invention  instead of falling into the old mad scientist routine. The film also shows  the scientist as a tragic victim instead of as rampaging monster (which is  what happened in way too many 50's films). The special effects are good  enough and the acting is solid.",950227200,3,928,4.319767441860465

This movie rewards repeat viewings. The third time I watched it, I was on board, because it has a little bit of everything: drama, suspense, horror, etc. The sound effects are very good as well. The viewer gets a good feel of 1950's suburbia and family life, and it helps tell the story in a simpler fashion from a simpler time. The special effects (while humorous) are good for 1958. Considered a classic, The Fly was great for its time, and still resonates today, though I think the young audience would find it boring and cheesy. My advice is to be patient with this movie.

Andrew`s Blu-ray Review: Since I was a youngster, 'THE FLY' has remained a long-time favourite, and it wasn't only because Vincent Price starred in it, and definitely at the time I did think him the coolest actor around, and especially the most elegant actor in all of horror genre cinema. Okay, so maybe Vincent Price did have some small part to do with my love for films, but he's not the whole reason since he's only on screen for maybe a third of the running time. The same goes for Herbert Marshall. The two character actors are, of course, wonderful additions to the cast, and Vincent Price's performance here is just prior to his becoming the cherished horror icon he's remembered as today. They bring a level of seriousness and solemnness to a production that would normally pass as B-movie material.

As magnificent as those two gentlemen are, there is something darker and creepier imbuing the narrative, a sinister gothic atmosphere saturated with an inescapable air of apprehension. Audiences are made to constantly feel uneasy, worried, and afraid of something we have little to no information on. Even today, the film still manages to give rise to those same emotions of fearing the unknown, which is why 'THE FLY' continues as a beloved classic of the sci-fi horror subgenre, particularly from the 1950s Atomic-Age era when culture was suspicious of science. This is to the credit of director Kurt Neumann ['She Devil' and 'Kronos'] and screenwriter James Clavell ['The Great Escape'] for adapting George Langelaan's short story, though they significantly changed the &uuml;ber-dark ending.

Watching the film as a youngster and being genuinely disturbed by it is one thing, but it would be years later until I finally understood and could appreciate what makes the experience effective. 'THE FLY' is one of those horror films that hinges on the success of its final reveal, a shocking finish that mixes horror with a subtle trace of sadness. The last few minutes are the ultimate clincher to everything preceding it, and the ride before arriving at it is a splendid build-up of consternation and concern, especially since we already how it ends. The film is as much a twisted gothic mystery tale as anything else, one where we desperately want to know why Helene [Patricia Owens] killed her scientist husband Andre Delambre [David Hedison]. She gruesomely crushed him with a hydraulic press but insists she's not a murderer and behaves oddly in order to hide her motives.

Vincent Price's Franois Delambre and Herbert Marshall's Inspector Charas are basically us, the audience, trying to piece together what happened. What would drive a happily married couple to murder the other, and why is Helene obsessed with flies, especially a unique one with a white head and arm? The answer to that last question doesn't arrive until the very suspenseful end, the big payoff which has since become a familiar sight in the history of the cinema, making it bit more comical today than the ultimate shocker it once was. Neumann does exceptionally well generating confusion and anticipation in scenes where Helene frantically attempts to capture the fly and the stress bring out a hidden temper towards her son Philippe Delambre [Charles Herbert] and their housemaid Emma [Kathleen Freeman].

On a deeper, more unconscious level, 'THE FLY' speaks to our innate desire for discovery, of taking control of our natural environment, and a pursuit for explaining the unknown. Andre's experiments on the matter transporter he calls the disintegrator-integrator and the dangers he uncovers playing God is an obvious imputation of that sentiment. Yet, there's more to Neumann's film than this and a suggestive commentary on that intrinsic need in all of us to explain our love of horror, the abnormal and the grotesque. Like Helene pulling on her husband's black hood to discover a hideously disfigured man and a repugnancy that's equally fascinating and we are born with a curiosity that compels us even against self-preservation to see what hides beneath the black veil. We secretly want to be horrified and look away, yet we can't seem to help staring at the very thing which disturbs. I love 'The Fly' because it constantly builds towards that final reveal and makes me want to see it for myself. I just wish they would release the black and white follow up ""The Return of The Fly"" in the Blu-ray format and especially in another Limited Edition SteelBook.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The sci-fi horror classic lands on Blu-ray with a brilliant 1080p encode image. Nicely showcasing the lovely photography of Karl Struss, the picture is beautifully detailed and very well-defined. The fade-in and fade-out edits are understandably soft and blurry, and few sequences are not as distinct with a smidge of noise around the edges. Although inherent to the source, it's apparent enough to be somewhat distracting. The rest of the 2.35:1 image displays a sumptuous array of primaries, animating the screen with life, and warm, energetic pastel hues. Contrast is comfortably bright with crisp, brilliant whites while blacks are rich and true with excellent shadow details. This high-definition transfer is by far the best the film has ever looked.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  In the audio department, the movie makes a scarily terrifying buzz with this excellent 4.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Not sure if the people at 20th Century Fox went to the original four-track magnetic stereo strip for this, but what we have sounds fantastic and remains to faithful to its original design. The surround sounds are largely silent, which is to be expected, as the technology was really only used to widen the front soundstage and an attractive gimmick that complemented the equally wider-than-television image on screen, to attract more audiences to the cinema. The music of Paul Sawtell does the majority of the work by creating a wonderfully engaging sound field, exhibiting sharp, distinct highs along with clean detailed mid ranges. The buzzing of flies is quite amusing as the little bugs fly all across the screen convincingly, from left to right and top to bottom. A bit of bass adds some depth to the score, as well as to the electronic gadgets inside Andre's laboratory every time he turns them on. Vocals are intelligible and move across the channels according the position of the character speaking, which only adds to the wider image effect. Overall, it's a terrifically enjoyable and well-done mix for a great classic.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with actor David Hedison and Film Historian David Del Valle: This is a fantastically charming and often quite funny commentary. David Del Valle is ""colourful"" bantering (as they say), and quite winningly with David Hedison. David Hedison has some great memories of the shoot, but rather interestingly, but David Hedison talks about wanting to have the transformation take place in phases, somewhat similar to the David Cronenberg remake. Feeling largely like an interview where David Hedison recollects and shares various awesome memories, the chat is insightful, funny and terrifically entertaining.

Special Feature: Biography: Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain [1997] [44:00] This is a typically fine Biography overview of the actor's life and career. An episode from the Biography TV series focused on the life and career of the priceless Vincent Price. Contributors to this TV Special are Richard Kiley (voice), Vincent Price (archive footage), Lucy Chase Williams (Vincent Price's biographer), Victoria Price (Vincent Price's daughter), Norman Lloyd, Hazel Court, Dennis Hopper, Jane Russell, Roger Corman, Roddy McDowall, Lynn Bari (archive footage), Constance Bennett (archive footage), William Castle (archive footage), Carolyn Craig (archive footage), Mark Damon (archive footage), Myrna Fahey (archive footage), Charles Herbert (archive footage), Jennifer Jones (archive footage), Boris Karloff (archive footage), Pamela Lincoln (archive footage), Peter Lorre (archive footage), Herbert Marshall (archive footage), Patricia Owens (archive footage), Gene Tierney (archive footage), Burt Ward (archive footage) and Gregory Peck (archive footage) (uncredited). Directed by Kerry Jensen. Screenplay by Lucy Chase Williams. Produced by CarolAnne Dolan, Kerry Jensen, Kevin Burns, Kim Egan, Lawrence Williams. Michael Cascio and Sophie Livsey. Music by Chris Many and Tom Jenkins.

Special Feature: Fly Trap: Catching a Classic [11:30] David Hedison returns with film historians and others to discuss the film, its origins, production and its lasting legacy on horror cinema. It is a fun little piece concentrating on three ""original"" Fly films. Its notable how brown and ugly the elements of THE FLY appear in this documentary compared to the actual feature presentation on the Blu-ray. It also includes comments from David Hedison, David Del Valle, Screenwriter and Film Historian Steve Haberman, Director and Screenwriter Donald F. Glut, Fangoria Magazine editor Tony Timpone, and actor Brett Halsey. We learn about the source story and its path to the screen, cast and performances, the films success and sequels. Classic seems too brief and too general. It needs a lot more time to adequately cover all three horror films, so while we get some decent notes, the piece doesnt tell us much.

Special Feature: Fox Movietone News [00:54] This is a very short piece on the Out of this World Premiere of the film THE FLY in San Francisco, which featured several ""guest monsters,"" where attendees were greeted by such horror film giants as Dracula, Frankenstein and the Mummy, who were, ironically, monsters associated with Universal Pictures.

Theatrical Trailer [1:59] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for 'THE FLY.'

Finally, starring the always wonderful Vincent Price and 'THE FLY' is a true sci-fi horror classic that continues to entertain, surprise and shock. Director Kurt Neumann is exceptional at building suspense and a thick air of apprehension in a murder mystery that teases audiences into wanting to see the grotesquely shocking reveal and closes with one last final outrageous clincher. The Blu-ray arrives with a great picture quality and especially in the awesome designed embossed Limited Edition SteelBook and the best the film has ever looked, and an excellent audio presentation. With a small but still enjoyable set of supplements, the overall package makes an awesome addition to the horror collection.  THE FLY may in fact strike some as too relentlessly low key to build much horror, and while it's true this isn't an overly bloody or gruesome affair, its mood is palpable and brooding sense of doom it creates, especially as things wend their way toward the devastating climax, is remarkable. This Blu-ray is yet another fantastic presentation of a catalogue title by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. Again, the reason it has been an all-time favourite of mine, especially the classic scene near the end of the film, where the fly shouts out ""Help me! Help me!"" is another reason to own this brilliant Blu-ray disc and again it is an honour to add this to my ever increasing Vincent Price Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

However, being considered a classic film, this original version with Vincent Price was nicely priced, so I decided to revisit it. I am glad I did. This version builds a nice tension right up to the end. Acting is excellent and production values are very good.

With rich colors and sharp clarity, the film comes alive like never before and, perhaps due to me being older and wiser, I really enjoyed this film. Vincent Price is great, in one of his mre restrained performances, as is David (billed here as Al) Hedison, as the protagonist. The plot moves along at a good pace and suspense is maintained throughout. Being a thoughtful, intelligent film, it is perhaps a bit underrated compared to other, more sensational, films of its genre, but it's definitely worth watching...again.",1382400000,,784,4.858208955223881

The relationship between Andre and his wife is so true and faithful and loving, you can really feel her anguish when she does what she has to do. And his total love for her is very evident after the accident. But this is also a great horror film. The climax is one of the screen's most unforgettable moments. The Blu-ray transfer and audio are excellent. My one complaint is with the artwork on the case and on the disc. Who is that woman?? It's definitely not Patricia Owens.

275071,5,6300247589,"20th Century Fox has finally released the Fifties cult classic Director Kurt Neumann's 'THE FLY'-1958 for Sci-Fi/Horror fans.  Available in VHS in poor pan and scan faded color prints and released on DVD in 2007 as part of a 'FLY' film collection including the sequels Director Edward Bernds 'RETURN OF THE FLY'-1958  and Director Don Sharp's British production 'CURSE OF THE FLY'-1965, this Blu-Ray release is the definitive transfer and really shows what the Blu-Ray format is all about.  Gone are the faded color dyes and intermittent lines on the negative, Fox has restored the film in a pristine transfer restoring the rich colors and enhances the photography by venerable cameraman Karl Struss in its proper 2.35 ratio, in short, its the best the film has ever looked since projected in theatres at that time.  The beautiful music score by Paul Sawtell gets its just due finally in DTS Dolby Digital Audio so we can appreciate its subtle nuances.  Watching the film in this fashion , it made me appreciate actor David Hedison's (here billed as Al Hedison) wonderful performance seemingly overshadowed by Herbert Marshall, Patricia Owens, and pre-Horror star Vincent Price all these years.  Price still was not embedded in the publics eye as a Horror star as of yet but his ventures with Director William Castle would take care of that.  Extras include a wonderful 45 minute biography on Price's film career , a featurette 'FLY TRAP:CATCHING A CLASSIC' already included on the DVD release , and commentary with actor David Hedison and film Historian David Del Valle.  Hedison has some great memories of the shoot.  All in all, a worthy purchase for film collectors and makes you appreciate the Blu-Ray format, something which many studios have taken for granted and may finally bring them to their senses in releasing older films as they were meant to be viewed. Highly recommended.",1380067200,50,1887,5.003194888178914
275141,5,6300247589,"I've always felt the original ""Fly"" was a bit underappreciated.  Watching the film for the first time in several years, and for the first time in sparkling high definition, I may have figured something out.  Despite the title character, which would indicate low-budget ""b"" movie thrills, the film takes itself very seriously.  It is, I daresay, one of the few really ""adult"" sci-fi/horror films of its era.

Fox's new Blu-ray, while not quite flawless, is certainly the best the film has ever looked on a home screen.  Prior to watching it, I played the first 10 minutes of the previous DVD release (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly-Collection-The-Fly-Return-Of-The-Fly-The-Curse-Of-The-Fly/dp/B000RXVNDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly Collection (The Fly / Return Of The Fly / The Curse Of The Fly)</a>, and while video quality of that release is quite nice, there are subtle improvements in the new release.  There is still a bit of grain in some of the darker scenes--a common issue with many Blu-ray movies--but I never found it very distracting.  The format really shows its strengths in the lab scenes, with bright fluorescent lights and various other apparatus all aglow.  Outdoor daytime scenes, particularly the garden one near the film's end, are about as good as anything being made today.  Someone complained about the sound mix; but I honestly didn't have any problems with it.  Dialogue was clear throughout, and the occasional scream (including the chill-inducing wail of Andre Delambre's cat after a failed experiment) was fairly unnerving.

Extras include the (unrestored) trailer, an 11-minute overview of the film and its sequels, a ""Biography"" episode on Vincent Price, and commentary with star David Hedison.  I haven't played the commentary yet(despite my absolute love of movies and learning about them, I tend to get bored quickly with commentary tracks in general), but the rest of the bonus materials were enjoyable.

If you're a fan of The Fly, or just 50's sci-fi and horror in general, this is a must-have.  If you're considering an upgrade from the DVD, I'd say it's worth it, especially at the current price (about 16 bucks as of this writing).",1379721600,7,2234,5.400576368876081
275142,5,6300247589,"The picture is colorful but not sharp and possibly never was. Shamefully, this sounded better on VHS tape. When the kid is dragged down the stairs, you could hear him scream and the sound panned from right to left and made you jump. This Blu-ray might as well be mono for all the technician cared.

275143,1,6300247589,"I'm tired of paying a lot of money for movies that are being placed in these
cheap, wispy, thin Blu-ray cases that have been eaten away with the recycling symbols on both sides of the case.  All this does is weaken the walls of the case and allows for the artwork and disc to be more easily damaged via shipping and while at your home.  When the Blu-ray cases first came out they were thicker and much stronger and not eaten away with the false recycling symbol.  Who's going to throw their Blu-ray case away after receiving their movie just so that it can be recycled?  It's just another way for these greedy manufacturers to save money and make money while delivering a below par product to the American people.

Olive Films and Universal are two companies that still sell their movies in solid cases (still to thin) but other major companies like Fox and Warner Bros., are the ones putting their movies into the cheap, eaten-away and shameful cases.  The best company is Criterion--their cases are the best. They should be emulated by all the other companies selling Blu-ray movies.

They should have pride in presenting their movies for sale to the public but all they really care about is revenue.  Instead of striving for excellence, they work hard to provide the bare minimum. In short, they don't care. It truly takes a lot of effort to make such flimsy-cheap cases--it had to be planned.  They're doing the same to the once strong and well-made DVD cases.",1379289600,11,1464,4.6434108527131785
275144,5,6300247589,"This is a great movie. It is ashamed that the two sequels were not up to the original. One has to remember this was before George Lucas taught Hollywood that sequels required a good story, not just a rehash, and more money to keep the quality up. The story is about communication (between people and well as the pods). It would be nice if the whole ""trilogy"" of the original was together on blue-ray.",1378771200,6,400,4.418918918918919
275145,5,6300247589,"I originally was disappointed that they did not give the Fly the same treatment they gave the DVD version giving all 3 fly movie with good quality and extras. I gave the movie 1 star.
Then I saw that the sequel ""Return of the Fly"" was going to be on the Vincent Price Collection 2"" So I realized that I was wrong to give the BluRay 1 star because of my militant consumer stance, so I bought the movie and watched it. It was gorgeous to say the least, all the detail crisp and vibrant. The commentary with Al Hedison the star was lightheared yet informative.  I came to the conclusion that even though whatever reason the VP 2 collection also by Fox contained the sequel, it was also more Vincent Price then the first film which was Al Hedisons moment to shine and they elected to join the sequel to that collection

Perhaps later they will coalesce the 3 films into a bundle, but I should judge on the merits of the film as released, not the marketing strategy of 20th Century Fox. So I wanted to make amends to my earlier jump the gun review and the BluRay I watched the credit it richly deserves.",1374883200,27,1098,4.299516908212561

275147,5,6300247589,"The Fly starring Vincent Price, is one hour and thirty-four minutes long and was released on August 29, 1958. The story takes place in Montreal, Quebec; which explains why the reason for the French accents. The film starts at the end when Helene Delembre has just taken part in killing her husband. Helene calls Francois Delambre (her brother-in-law) and Francois calls Police Inspector Charas. We find out in the film that Helene's husband, Andre Delambre, has made a machine that can transport atom through the air and to another place. When Andre runs a second tests on himself again, a fly gets caught in the machine with him and Andre has the left arm and head of a fly. After a few days of this new body, he finds himself losing his sanity and orders Helene to kill him. At the end of the movie when they begin to take Helene away, Philippe Delambre (her son) tell Uncle Francois that he has found the funny looking fly. Francois tells Inspector Charas about it. Philippe shows them both where the fly is and in the end Inspector Charas kills it with a rock. In the movie the monster fly is only shown for about ten minutes; though the left hand is shown earlier. So the horror does not come till the end of the story. Unlike most monster movies, The Fly seems to have a heart. The Fly does not go on any killing spree nor does The Fly kidnaps anyone. So at the end of the movie, one has to feel sad for The Fly. I give this movie an AAA+++.",1234656000,,1447,4.343173431734317
275148,5,6300247589,"Amongst the countless movies that focused around the unthinkable consequences of certain experiments that shone in more than one scientific mind that spanned from the middle thirties until the arrival to the moon (the epic peak of the scientific paradigm), this brief story had to its favor a significant element, to blend the science with the myth (Beauty and the beast or The phantom of the opera) in which the triviality plays an important role. This accidental experiment works out as an acidic metaphor and a terrible warning specially when you state all the factors are under control.

A clever scientist bets for a curious transportation device based on the integration and disintegration of the molecular structures. At the beginning everything seems going over wheels, but suddenly something absolutely unexpected happens and the genetic factor makes its appearance.

This movie is part of the very reduced catalogue of invaluable treasured films you have to get at the moment to achieve the most emblematic sci-fi movies ever made.",1230336000,,1041,5.227544910179641
275149,5,6300247589,"The best laid plans of mice and men, not to mention flies.

This is first rate science fiction, but of a heart-wrenching variety.

This story is a bit in the spirit of Jack London tales, where some spirited individual gets crushed (in this case, literally), by going out too far on his own.

In this case the spirited individual is a family man who happens to be a scientific genius, developing in his basement the first matter teleportation device.  It works, but he fails to realize that the wilderness he confronts in it is not as user friendly as his wife and kid.  It confuses him with a fly (which was in the disintegrator with him but escaping his notice).  In other words he escapes nature's notice, which didn't bother to distinguish him from the fly, treating him with even more indifference than he treated the fly...

Interestingly, the 1986 remake was not a remake at all, but a spinoff.  This spinoff being the opposite story, really: There, only the interpersonal relations fail to be user friendly; nature is fine.  (In both films there is a love triangle, but in the first the hero is on the inside track and fine; in the second, the hero is on the outside-and it does him in.)

Acting is very good and script is flawless.  Effects do what they need to do and makeup is effective (sometimes very).

One of the best acting scenes is when the wife wakes up in bed alone, clothed, and we watch her as she gradually realizes that what she slowly remembers was not a nightmare, but real-a very intense scene and executed without a word.

Another good scene is where the wife finally sees him eye to eye for the first time after the accident, expecting him to be ok by hoping against hope.  She is disappointed, to put it mildly.  And the audience can't help but feel for and with her.  And with him.

The drama in the lab, with the lab-coat and ever-present equations on the blackboard silently in the background, is classic and captivating; in the most dramatic moment the blackboard gets carelessly rubbed out and the husband scribbles, ""I love you.""

Hedison's performance is unforgettable.

Though tragic, the film has its own charm and fascination.  His son in the end decides that he also wants to be a scientist, and many a kid watching the film may well come to the same conclusion.

275150,4,6300247589,"1958's ""The Fly"" is the original story of the 1986 version, the version that most of the people know. Not as flashy as the 1986 David Cronenberg's version, but the original ""Fly"" remains very intriguing. ""The Fly"" is more a mystery film than a thriller. More storytelling oriented, ""The Fly"" is a very interesting movie, it's really hard to ignore the essence of the film, because the ""monster"" has human feelings and human fears. You can't help but feel sorry for this unlucky scientist and his family.

Since the very beginning, this movie invites the viewer to watch as the story unfolds. There is the unrecognizable body of a man, murdered by his wife, and to increase the mystery, the woman is looking for a fly with a white head. Eventually we learn why she is desperately trying to catch that intriguing bug. ""The Fly"" has pretty decent special effects and makeup, specially if we consider that this movie is almost 50 years old. And the final scene is very disturbing, still it is a very shocking image.

The biggest achievement of this film, is that it's able to involve the viewer deep inside the story, the mystery, and the characters emotions and feelings. ""The Fly"" is a very solid film, specially if you like mystery or sci-fi films.",1110931200,,1247,4.689497716894977
