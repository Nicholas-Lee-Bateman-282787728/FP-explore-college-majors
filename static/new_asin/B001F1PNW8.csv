8514476,5,B001F1PNW8,"I was thinking about a film that I watched one night that I could not turn away from; ""A Room Nearby.""  I was looking for it online, when I came across this gem of a film.  If you are a dog lover, you will love this film.  I want to thank the film makers for this.  Amazing animation work and beautiful stories of our bonds with dogs.",1301011200,,334,3.9402985074626864
8514477,5,B001F1PNW8,"I do not know who put all the effort into this site to illegally sell our DVD. We find it appalling and we regret that so many people searching for the DVD think that it is unavailable. Thank you to all of you who prevailed and found us through PBS/ITVS or other means. We would love to share our films with you. We have plenty available.

8514478,5,B001F1PNW8,"I just saw ""Still Life with Animated Dogs"" on PBS and was blown away. Amazing fluid animation, wonderful stories, terrific music (hardly noticed, which is the best kind of accompaniment). I think of it as an animated journal, beautifully written, moving and genuine. I love autobiographical stories, have even written a few myself (""Put Your Big Girl Panties On and Deal With It"") -- and this one is the best. I'd give it ten stars if I could.",1220313600,,443,4.6923076923076925
