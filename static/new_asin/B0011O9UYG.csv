8242259,5,B0011O9UYG,"The British Invasion kicks in to high gear! Peter Casson's Intermediate Skills sea kayaking video packs everything you need to know to be safe and have fun sea kayaking in to one DVD. Peter is a great paddler, instructor and now, video star. He shares all his BCU and ACA accredited experience with the viewers so they can advance their sea kayaking skills to new levels. I highly recommend this DVD.",1200009600,4,400,4.647887323943662
