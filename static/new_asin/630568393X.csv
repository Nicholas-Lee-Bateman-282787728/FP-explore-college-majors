1067812,4,630568393X,"When Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich was assassinated by Czech patriots in 1942, the immediate result was the liquidation of the entire village of Lidice.  Every citizen was murdered and the town itself reduced to rubble.  The enormity of this crime was not made apparent at the time, but in HANGMEN ALSO DIE, director Fritz Lang and screenwriter Bertold Brecht created a film that dramatises the essential events in a manner that suffers from some deliberately heavy acting but in no way subtracts from its incredible power.

Brian Donlevy in surely the flattest of his career sleepwalks through his role as Dr. Svoboda, the assassin.  One would think that the ethical issues of deciding whether to give himself up for execution or allowing innocent hostages to be shot should have occupied more of Donlevy's interpretation of the assassin.  Donlevy does little more than allow others to debate the need to weigh one life against hundreds of others when there are larger issues at stake.  To director Lang's credit, he allows the film to address the tricky issue of whether there can even be larger issues than human lives. Lang comes firmly down on the side that in the larger horror of war some issues of right and justice must trump the lives of those who pay for the right of others to debate these ethical dilemmas.  Walter Brennan as Professor Novotny shows the same lack of dramatic fire that afflicts Donlevy.  In fact, it becomes clear that the only characters who show any pizzazz are the Nazis.  Some critics have suggested that this disparity was the deliberate intent of Lang, whom they saw as interested more in the underlying themes of justice versus retribution than in character glorification.  The Nazis are so over the top that this gap cannot be by accident.  Alexander Granach as Gestapo Inspector Gruner and Gene Lockhart as turncoat Czaca positively revel in their nefarious machinations. I see this discrepancy more as revelatory of Lang's wish to present the Czech hostages as internal mirrors of their pacific exteriors.  And on those rare occasions when the hostages show a more direct attitude about their lot, they are quite capable of evincing a believable straightforwardness.

When the film was released in 1943, audiences knew the Nazis were evil, but evil more in the Al Capone sense than in any genocidal one. The ending in which the duplicitous Czaca is framed for Heydrich's murder implies that as bad as the Germans were their word about releasing hostages could be trusted.  History has proven otherwise.  HANGMEN ALSO DIE is a life-affirming film that shows that even during the horrors of genocide, men and women of courage could yet find the dignity to retain their humanity even as their hammy tormentors could lose theirs.",1170547200,,2769,4.976138828633406
1067813,3,630568393X,"'Hangmen Also Die' takes as its story, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, a German Nazi official, head of the security police, chief deputy to the head of the Schutzstaffel, Heinrich Himmler, who organized mass exterminations of European Jews during the opening years of World War II... and also the subsequent retaliatory devastation of Lidice, a Czech mining village...

With his usual skill, Lang weaves a tale of gripping suspense: the Gestapo's efforts to find the assassin; the workings of the Czech resistance fighters; and the traitor who is finally hoisted on his own petard...

1067814,2,630568393X,"This is a relatively straightforward propaganda melodrama, with nothing

particularly compelling to recommend it, but for one notable exception.

Bertold Brecht's villains and miscreants are all so full of gusto. They share kinship with the ones in Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny after all. It seems Brecht could not create a scoundrel he couldn't admire on a certain, mischievous level. The ones in this film are no exception, and lift it out of the ""ordinary"" into the realm of the ""oddity"".",1165795200,,493,5.15
1067815,5,630568393X,"Classic Expressionist images and sly situations by Fritz Lang; cinematography by James Wong Howe; propaganda poetry by Bertolt Brecht (so nice they recite it twice in succession, in case we've missed the point)--HANGMEN ALSO DIE is irresistable!

The story was inspired by the actual assassination of Reinhard Heydrick, who had earlier appeared as himself in Riefenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.  It's interesting to note that Heydrick continued to have a successful film career for another fifty years, for he also appears posthumously in at least eleven more motion pictures!

Some reviews complain about Brian Donleavy's alleged ""lethargic"" performance, though I found it consistent with his other straightforward work and quite acceptable.  It's peculiar, however, to witness the Czech underground played with so many extremely American faces and mannerisms--Donleavy and O'Keefe in particular.  I've never been a fan of Walter Brennan, between the geezer impersonations and his politics; but he does do very well in what elsewhere would be the ""Walter Huston"" role (NORTH STAR, DRAGON SEED, and others). If any non-German actor's performance seems weaker than others, it's Anna Lee's.  But this entire topic only arises because the performances by German actors are so excellent.

In writings of Hollywood (notably Gore Vidal's SCREENING HISTORY and Waugh's THE LOVED ONE), much has been made of the British colony of actors and writers whose films before and during WW2 consciously endeavored to increase American sympathy and support for their homeland.  But there's an unusual fascination in watching German actors (not to mention Fritz Lang and ""Bert"" Brecht) pulling out all the stops in this project.

Much is justifiably made of Hans Heinrich Twardowski's dazzling impersonation of Reinhard Heydrick at the beginning of the movie, which makes the ""Nazis"" of Otto Preminger, Conrad Veidt, and Erich von Stroheim look like Gandhi, but my ""favorite"" Nazi in the film is the satirical limning of a Gestapo officer in charge of ""questioning"" a couple key female suspects.  Priceless!  As is the performance of the old-lady grocer who refuses to rat out Anna Lee.  She, the girl's gossipy aunt, and the Nazi in charge of the investigation have all stepped out of earlier Lang films (M, FURY, etc.) and bring tremendous Old World authenticity to their roles.

The final irony lies in the film's end-title.  As Amazon notes, after the plot's presumed climax the end-title challenges whether this is REALLY the end of the story.  In truth, the original film was several minutes longer, and included the execution of the hostages.  Too grim for war propaganda of 1943?  (Some suggest it was excised perhaps before its release in Europe; and it's known that HUAC banned the movie as possibly pro-Communist, and that the American public was ""protected"" from it for decades.)  Or perhaps the studio said Genug already, for a film that's well over two hours long even WITH the snipping?

Doubtless that lopping contributed to Brecht's dissatisfaction with the final product.  Meanwhile, the German-speaker who was hired to help him with the project, John Wexley, was indeed a Communist and, like Brecht, was later brought before HUAC--though with more dire consequences.",1150329600,9,3266,5.292635658914729
1067816,4,630568393X,"Fritz Lang's ""Hangmen Also Die"", written by Bertholt Brecht is a propagandized 1943 account of the assassination of Reichprotector Reinhard Heydrich.  Heydrich was the despicable, pompous and belligerent Nazi appointed military governor of parts of Czechoslavakia played by Hans Heinrich von Twardowski.  The hated Nazi is shot by Dr. Franticek Svoboda played effectively by Hollywood tough guy Brian Donlevy.

Donlevy is part of a Czech underground anti-Nazi movement.  As a result of his involvement Donlevy is ultimately protected by the Novotny family headed by terrific character actor Walter Brennan, who plays Professor Stephen Novotny.  His daughter, Nasha played by Anna Lee, is initially willing to colloborate with the Gestapo to reveal the identity of the assassin to protect her family.  As punishment for the shooting, prominent Czech citizens are rounded up and put in camps to be summarily executed.  Included in this group is her father, Brennan.

Lee eventually comes around, inspired by the bravery of the Czech citizens. She aids Donlevy in ultimately framing traitorous Czech beer magnate Emil Czaka played by rotund Gene Lockhart as the assassin.

Lang's creation was a powerful film that delivered an important message to the viewers in the midst of WW2.  The resolve and determination of the Czech people to throw off the yoke and Nazi oppression was effectively portrayed.",1114128000,3,1397,5.3963133640553
1067817,4,630568393X,"I love war movies made during the war they portray.  They're usually unabashed propaganda, bold strokes painted with primary colors.  The stories are the ones that matter today, and will sometimes be buried by history.  The bad guys are ruthless, invincible, menacing without the benefit of hindsight.  It's like Red Riding Hood meeting the wolf.

  Fritz Lang's 1943 HANGMEN ALSO DIE is one such film.  Based on a true story, it's a moving tale set in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia.  The Reichprotektor Heydrich  has been assassinated and the Gestapo is conducting a massive investigation to apprehend the killer.

  Frustrated in their search, and by the Czech resistance, the Gestapo rounds up 400 hostages and begin executing them at regular intervals until the assassin in apprehended.  Brian Donlevy plays the killer, Dr. Franticek Svoboda, Anna Lee the young woman who inadvertently (at first) throws the authorities off his trail, and Walter Brennan plays Prof. Stephen Novotny, Anna Lee's father and one of the four hundred hostages.

The Nazis in HANGMEN ALSO DIE were played by Jewish actors, refugees from a hostile Europe.  Whether brooding over a pimple on the cheek, annoyingly cracking knuckles while tormenting a poor old vegetable monger, or cavorting with naughty girls, Lang's Gestapo agents are animated and interesting.  The Czechs, on the other hand, are all played by American actors and all, even Brennan, give stiff, dull, and wooden performances.  Donlevy especially gives some of the flattest line readings of his career.

  It's tempting to blame the actors, but in Lotte Eisner's admiring biography, Fritz Lang, she quotes an old interview in which Lang discussed the movie. ""We didn't want,"" Lang said, ""analyses of characters, we simply schematized into those who resist and those who organize, those who aspire to freedom but have not yet found or chosen the means of action, and finally the collaborators, the genuine enemy of the people....

  ""I don't think it is possible in such a plot to go far into the psychological development because the psychology does not change.""  In other words Lang got the performances he wanted, without any emotional window dressing.  Well, he's a genius, I'm not, but Lordy it would have been nice if his heroes had had a little more panache, a little more brio.

I had a few problems with this film.  The plot pivots on a shaky point or two - the unsmeared lipstick clue, two unarmed men bearing down on a man with a gun without being shot - that seem a little manufactured and more than a little implausible.  Still, HANGMEN ALSO DIE was stylish and an interesting take on a little talked about, at least in America, incident in World War II.",1106697600,16,2712,4.991071428571429
1067818,3,630568393X,"Restorations of a number of great German Lang films have recently been released on DVD (Metropolis, Niebelungen, Mabuse).  Given the enormous stature of these early works, one is tempted to search carefully through his numerous Hollywood projects to find the forgotten classic even more accessible to the modern viewer.  The idea of a collaboration with Bertolt Brecht would seem to hold considerable promise at capturing the best from two masters of Weimar expressionism.
  There is a lot of good stuff going for ""Hangmen"", with its dark, shadowy vision and rapidly evolving storyline.  However, the plot is plagued by war-era propoganda, which only weakens what should already be the compellingly tense situation of the Nazi occupation of Prague.  Such sentimentallity is, of course, understandable, and was easily overcome by at least a few other contemporary Hollywood pictures.
  Unfortunately, this film was consigned grade-B status by the studio, and it is the lack of acting talent (save a very effective job by Walter Brennan) that really hobbles the film.  It is a bit disconcerting when the actors playing the Nazis exhibit much more personality than the wooden faced Czechs who we're supposed to be rooting for.

  Also, (2) the film demonstrates, as few others do as well, the pain & struggles endured in occupied countries by anti-Nazi patriots, trying to resist & to survive to fight again.",1047254400,4,498,4.712643678160919
1067820,5,630568393X,"HANGMEN ALSO DIE is probably most infamous as the film for which Bertolt Brecht did *not* receive screenplay credit. In a more than usually petty bout of Hollywood parochialism, the credit was given to his American  collaborator (who shall remain nameless here), despite the testimony of  director Fritz Lang that Brecht was responsible for every important aspect  of the script. Imagine Elizabeth I's chamberlain saying, ""Who is this  Shakespeare guy, anyway? Let's say Court Favorite wrote it. He can use the  credit."" and you'll get a sense of the idiocy of this decision. (Lotte  Eisner's FRITZ LANG describes these events with effective concision.)
It  is not to deny the tremendous contributions of Lang, cinematographer James  Wong Howe and a troupe of first rate character actors to suggest that  everything that distinguishes HANGMEN results from Brecht's participation.  In lesser hands, the events surrounding the assassination of Heydrich might  make an entertaining political melodrama. The formula of stalwart, virtuous  victims triumphing over a brutal tyranny rarely fails, particularly with  American audiences, eager to re-affirm the democratic mythos repeatedly and  uncritically.
Such a film might make more effective propaganda, something  like Warner Bros.'s CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY. As such, it wouldn't warrant  much more than a footnote in Hollywood history. Brecht's contribution comes  from his unequaled sense of the contradictions and ironies of history and  power. A victim of persecution from both the Nazis and the House  Un-American Activities Committee, he had the political sophistication not  to make the Germans and their collaborators in this film larger-than-life  Evils, but obviously human creatures with more than a shade of appeal.
The Czechs, on the other hand, are not so much virtuous as wooden and  bloodless. Their numerous, long speeches about freedom and humanity are  unconvincing and platitudinous. There is, in true Brechtian fashion, no  effort to make us ""identify"" with them, to give us goose bumps of  sympathy with the high ideals. Quite the contrary, the film unflinchingly  faces the partisans' complicity in the bloody events resulting from the  assassination. Events unwind with clockwork precision, deadlier and darker  with each step as *both* sides demand ever greater sacrifice from ordinary  people.
Precisely because it does not shy away from the complexities of  the situation, HANGMEN makes a much stronger statement in favor of  political responsibility than a simple melodrama could. For the Germans can  be somewhat sympathetic and the Czechs unappealing, and the latter can  *still* be seen as ultimately right. Such a level of sophistication is rare  in film of any kind. That it comes from Hollywood must be attributed to the  presence of an unusually gifted set of &eacute;migr&eacute; talent worthy of the theme.  If HANGMEN ALSO DIE is not for everyone, it is definitely for anyone who  responds to those rare instancs when a film treats us as intelligent  adults.",961459200,14,3045,5.4

1068265,5,630568393X,"During the early days of the Nazi era, film director Fritz Lang sent a proposal around stating his intention to make a film entitled The Murderer Among Us.  Beset by a consequent series of turn-downs and threatening phone calls, he went to a prospective backer and asked him why people were so upset about making a film about the child killer Peter Kurten.  .  The backer, surprised, said, Oh is that what the film is about?  He immediately got on the phone, briefly spoke and then hung up, turning to Lang and informing him that he had complete backing and support for the film.  What changed?  Then Lang glanced at the collar of the backer and saw the SS insignia.  Everybody had thought that by murderer, he was referring to the Nazis.  Still, Lang changed the title from The Murderer Among Us to M and the film was a smash success.  Herr Goebbels as a result, asked Lang to take over the German film industry.  Lang refused, split from his wife who was pro-Hitler and came to the US.  Moreover, the tortured child-killer in M was made into a Jewish character by the opportunistic Nazis.
When the Reichstag fire happened, Germans premier leftist playwright Bertolt Brecht told his Jewish actress wife Helen Wiesel that it was time to leave Germany.  Brecht had already been on Hitlers hit list,; no doubt, his works were prominent among the books that went into the book burnings.  The couple too wound up in the US where Brecht was to write his first and only screenplay and work with Fritz Lang for the first time.  The resulting film was Hangmen Also Diea gem of a film which should be watched by anyone seeking enlightenment about modern history and its most puzzling and insanely horrifying periods.
It starred one of our greatest actors, Walter Brennan, in what I consider to be his best roles.  Brian Donlevy as the assassin of the hangman Reinhard Heydrich in a controlled performance and the splendid Gene Lockhart as the slimeball.  Anna Lee held it all together in a multi-shaded performance and I disagree that Dennis OKeefe was out of place.  There were many American types in the midst of the Reich environment and some were even with what was going on; so, for me, OKeefe worked.  Also it was nice to see Lionel Stander as the cab driver.  I don't know who the actor was who played Heydrich, he certainly didn't look like the real person, but he did manage to convey the complete aura of evil of the man which told me he must have been one of the worst.

1068268,5,630568393X,"This is the only English language screenplay by the great German playwright and humanist Bertolt Brecht, which alone makes it worth watching. He and the great German director Lang both fled the evil, stupid Nazis for Hollywood, so the film makers here know what they are talking about.

I give it 5 stars not because it is a 5 star thriller, but because it is a 5 star morality play. As entertainment it is engaging but it is not a great classic we might hope for from Lang and Brecht, as other reviewers have pointed out.  As a story about standing up to evil, it is a moving film and must have been inspiring during the middle of WW II when things appeared to still be going well for the stupid Nazis.  For me, a film derives its real power from the truths it examines about the human condition.

A collaboration between two great German artists who opposed the stupid Nazi regime, it is a highly fictionalized account of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, second in power in the SS and a main architect of the ""final solution"".  It is so fictionalized that the plot is basically a work of fiction, although the stupid Nazis and brave civilian resistance are real characters.  If you are interested in the actual history, there are a couple of other good films and some good books on the subject (e.g. ""HEYDRICH: The Face of Evil"").. This film is a carefully constructed morality play about the importance of people making great personal sacrifices to fight stupid, evil, thugs who gain power through brutality and ignorance, like the stupid Nazis.

Although it is watchable as a thriller, the film makers were much more concerned with their message. The main conflict is not with the stupid Nazis, but within the occupied Czech people, whether to keep their heads down and protect themselves, or oppose the stupid Nazi thugs even it means sacrificing their lives. The moral of the story is that that an organized, courageous people is more powerful than the most brutal repressive government.

Unfortunately, the truth of the historical event was not so clear. The reprisals for the Czech government-in-exile and British planned assassination were so vicious, more than portrayed in this film, that it was both the first and the last such Ally planned assassination attempt of a stupid Nazi leader. Possibly this was one reason that Lang and Brecht made the film, believing that the Nazi reprisals, no matter how many innocents are murdered, are a price people should be willing to pay  to bring down stupid evil fanatics.",1427328000,,2530,4.784403669724771

1068271,5,630568393X,"This is a film made by Fritz Lang based on a script written by Bertold Brecht and Fritz Lang, starring a somewhat young Walter Brennan, at least Brennan was younger than when he played in the Cowboy television shows I remember him from.

This movie is a fictionalized account of the murder of SS Reichsprotector Reinhardt Heydrich and the reprisal murder of hostages in Occupied Czechoslovakia.  This movie was made in 1943, about 6 months after the assassination, and seems to be function as both anti-Nazi propaganda and a drama.

There are bits that seems strange. For example, I watched the first 6 minutes about three times to see how I missed the important bit where Heydrich is killed.  It turns out that I didn't miss it, at all, it wasn't in the film.  The film transitions from Heydrich playing the typical bullying Nazi, to driving off in his car, to our hero walking away from the assassination, which has already happened. Heydrich's assassination is purely off-stage. I suspect this was because the filmmakers knew that Heydrich had been killed, but didn't know how.  In any event, they make the assassin, a lone Communist-affiliated doctor, rather than a team of British agents parachuted into Czechoslovakia.

Thereafter, the movie is a melodramatic cat and mouse story about how the assassin involves a Czek woman, and how hostages are taken, and how the resistance mounts a cagey fraud to frame a Nazi collaborator. In between, there are stirring calls to patriotism and depictions of Nazi beastliness.

The historical Communist angle is interesting as well.  I take it that it is no surprise that Brecht would make the hero someone who is affiliated with the Communists, although, frankly, the fact that this is a Communist cell is only hinted at.  On the other hand, it was interesting to recognize one of the actors - the cab driver - from his trademark gravelly voice as Lionel Stander, who played ""Max"" the driver on ""Hart to Hart.""  A quick internet search turned up the fact that Stander actually was a Communist who had been unmasked by the HUAC in the 1950s. For his part, Walter Brennan, was taller and thinner than I remember him, and an internet search on him disclosed that he won three Oscars in the 1930s, which puts him in an exclusive club of less than a half dozen actors who have received as many Oscars.

The story is convoluted and intricate, and probably doesn't make a lot of sense in the cold light of rationality.  Also, it was amusing to see how the Czechs were all played as Americans, with American accents and slang and attitudes, which actually heightened the timeless theme that ""It Could Happen Here,"" which might have been the filmmaker's intention.

Not a bad movie, but fascinating as a bit of World War II history.",1425168000,,2768,4.7756813417190775

1068299,4,630568393X,"PLOT: FRITZ LANG gives his touch to the Death of Heidrich and the man hunt for the killers...

1942~Nazi Germany was the master of Europe. The Skoda Munitions works in the heart of Czechoslovakia IS a key to German Victory. Hitler sends his 'iron fisted' minion Reinhart Heydrich to keep the Czech people in line. Heydrich was the 'master planner' of the Concentration Camps and killing of Jews.  Feared and hated. In this film he is played as arrogant and very dislikeable. The Czech Underground soon plans to KILL Heidrich. He is shot ... This version starts with THE KILLER (BRIAN DONLEVY) running down a busy street with the Germans hot on his heels. His ""escape"" taxi driver is taken into custody by the police. He desperately ends up in the apartment of a girl (ANNE LEE)....WHO aided in his avoiding the police on the street. The Novotony Family complete with scholar (WALTER BRENNEN) is first rate who's morals come before his own safety.  Donlevy escapes and we see he is a doctor. The Nazis soon have PROFESSOR NOTOVNY (BRENNAN)and hundreds of other famous Czechs are taken 'hostage' to put pressure on the Czechs to 'hand over' the elusive assassin. Lots of twists and turns in the plot. Lots over overacting on Anna Lees part but we stay glued. Lang uses the black and white film to show us the horror of the Nazi Gestapo and the tortures they use to get information. The Czech Underground has a traitor....CZAKA (GENE LOCKHART) who plays the cowardly arrogant traitor to the hilt. As hostages are soon being shot to ""persuade"" the Czechs to cooperate and give information, a last ditch effort to IMPLICATE Czaka is put into motion. This version has been excellently restored by the Cohan Film Collection. It is a visually a delight and the audio is clear and crisp. Well done.

Fritz Lang was a famous German director. He married a Jewish woman in the 1930s and made his ""escape"" to avoid arrest by the Nazis in the 1930s and settled in Hollywood. He was already famous from his masterpieces films of Metropolis and M. This was one of his Anti Nazi efforts. This is based on a real life event and very embellished by writers Brecht and Lang. Lang also directed and produced this. Lang use of the terror and evil Nazis to very successfully move this movie along. Lang ""insisted"" that the Nazis be ACTUAL German actors and the Czechs be Americans. This is why Dennis O'Keefe is VERY out of place as a Czech. This restored copy is excellent.

As an online critic, Ive always tried to position myself as one who tries to find something positive to say about any film Ive had the good fortune to screen, but I learned a long time ago that  for some folks  classic releases like this old-school black-and-white release just doesnt interest them.  Still, theres something to be said  and definitely lessons to be learned  from a feature like HANGMEN ALSO DIE: the film is a reminder of what not so much what combat looks like but stands as a vivid accounting of how regular folks like you and me end up being treated by those who would rather see us dead than share Gods green earth with us.  At times its amazing grim for something produced in the 1940s  but isn't that precisely what the storytellers wanted us to remember?

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then Id encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

From the product packaging: This noir-like espionage thriller is set in occupied Czechoslovakia and revolves around the successful plot by Czech resistance to assassinate Deputy Reich-Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Hangman Reinhard Heydrich and the hunt by the Gestapo to track down the killers.

Ive seen plenty of films from the 1940s which directly or indirectly take shots at Nazi Germany and the general policies and practices of the Third Reich, but Ive never seen what was obviously produced to serve as anti-Nazi political propaganda the likes featured in HANGMEN ALSO DIE.  To be clear, Ive never even heard of this release (maybe not so much a surprise), not in my reading on 40s films nor any scholarly pursuits in noir flicks.  Perhaps because HANGMEN charted its course clearly in its opening minutes and stayed true to its convictions from start-to-finish that academicians, film scholars, and the like have found it an uncomfortable film to chat about as much as they have other releases.  Whatever the case, hopefully this new release will address that deficiency and give this story the attention it deserves.

While others have classified the HANGMEN as coming from the noir genre, I don't quite see it that way.  While many of the characters do possess some shifting motivations, the bulk of these characters are victims of the oppressive German regime (the tale essentially explores German-occupied Czechoslovakia), and, as such, they're committed to just one agenda: diminishing the Nazi efforts in any way possible.  Certainly, Id never argue that the film doesnt possess the look, feel, and texture of other noir projects; still, Id stop short of calling it a fully-realized noir feature just based on my understanding of those films alone.

Fritz Lang directs from a script he helped Bertolt Brecht pen, and viewers certainly are in store for a real cinematic treat if theyve yet to see this one.  The restoration on the Blu ray I was provided is brilliant (I was amazed at the clever use of shadows throughout, and I marveled at the way light was used to direct the audiences eyes).  Essentially, the last half becomes a bit of a caper flick as ordinary Czech citizens join up with members of the Resistance to tie one of their own who has crossed the line and collaborated with the Germans; racing against time, all people end up converging in just the right ways to make for a nearly stand-up-and-cheer finish, though it isn't without some dire casualties.

HANGMEN ALSO DIE (1943) is produced by Arnold Pressburger Films.  DVD distribution for this release is being handled by the reliable Cohen Media Group.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is primarily an English spoken language release, though there are a few scenes where German language is spoken (they are not subtitled but I didn't find them all that difficult to follow).  As for the technical specifications?  Yowza!  This film has been brilliant restored and remastered; seriously, Ive rarely seen film this old look this good, and the cinematography by James Wong Howe is worth further study.  Lastly, if you're looking for special features, then hold on to your hat: theres a featurette on the restoration process along with an essay in the liner notes about the film; a feature-length commentary; an old German newsreel from the era; a restoration comparison piece; and the re-release trailer.  Its a wonderful assortment of materials for folks wanting to know more.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Taking a page out of the German War Machines propaganda playbook was a smart way to go for acclaimed director Fritz Lang and screenwriter Bertolt Brecht as HANGMEN ALSO DIE is a great, near-perfect textbook example of how to get ones political points across as efficiently as possible.  The film looks stunning given its age (marvelous restoration work), and most of the performances of the principles (hats off to Walter Brennan and Anna Lee) hold up quite well even 70 years later.  Thats impressive, no matter how you shake it.

In the interests of fairness, Im pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Cohen Media Group provided me with a Blu ray DVD of HANGMEN ALSO DIE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape or form influenced my opinion of it.",1410998400,12,5566,4.885106382978724

1068434,5,630568393X,"I am not too please by the $36 pre-release price, however, this is an excellent film.  Released in 1943 while Europe was still under Nazi control, it is a beautiful example of the era's wartime films.  While based on an historical event, it is not history.  It is, however, a great movie. with great suspense as the Nazis' slowly tighten the circle in their search for the assassin of Reinhard Heydrich - ""The Hangman""..  The Resistance struggles to protect him but interrogations slowly yield more clues.  The daily executions of hostages increases the pressure.  I will not outline the movie, that can be found elsewhere.  Nor will I nit-pick it.  I will say, without a doubt, it is worth seeing.
  P.S.  I am a Walter Brennan fan.  This role is outside his nornal screen roles but his performance as a professor/hostage is a joy to watch.",1408838400,18,841,4.684931506849315
1068435,3,630568393X,"""Hangmen Also Die"" is a 1943 film about the true life assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi ""Protector"" of German-occupied Prague, aka ""The Hangman"". There were many films that came out during the war, about events that were happening or had just happened. The film ""Wake Island"" (1942), for example, came out only a few weeks after the Island fell.  Similar films about the war include ""Stand by for Action"" (1942), ""Aerial Gunner"" (1943), ""Air Force"" (1943), ""Bataan"" (1943),  ""Bombardier"" (1943), ""Corregidor"" (1943), ""Guadalcanal Diary"" (1943), ""Sahara"" (1943), ""The Fighting Seabees"" (1944), ""Marine Raiders"" (1944), and ""Back to Bataan"" (1945).

The film stars Brain Donlevy, Walter Brennan and Anna Lee and features Gene Lockhart, Dennis O'Keefe, and Alexander Granach.

Donlevy is best known for his roles as a villain, so it's surprising to see him as a hero in this film. Indeed, another one of Donlevy's few heroic roles as in ""Wake Island"" which appeared the year before. Donley was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1939's ""Beau Geste"" as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff (Thomas Mitchell won for ""Stagecoach""). He appeared in almost 100 films between 1923 and 1969, but his busiest period was the 40s when he did more than 30 films including ""Command Decision"" (1948), ""The Virginian"" (1946), ""Two Years Before the Mast"" (1946), and ""Billy the Kid"" (1941). Donlevy plays a physician who assassinates the Hangman. Unfortunately Donlevy is a lot better villain than he is a hero, and the film suffers from this.

Walter Brennan won 3 Oscars for Best Supporting Actor (""Come and Get it"" in 1936, ""Kentucky"" in 1938, and ""The Westerner"" in 1941) and was nominated for his work in ""Sergeant York"" (1941). We know him best for his Emmy nominated role in the TV series ""The Real McCoys"", and his film comedies (""The Over the Hill Gang"") or as the grumpy side kick Stumpy in ""Rio Bravo"", but he was equally capable of playing the villain, as he showed in ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and again In ""How the West Was Won"" (1962).  What Walter Brennan didn't usually do is play a heroic straight man, which is what he does in this film, as a Professor whose daughter becomes inadvertently involved in the conspiracy to hide the assassin. Interestingly enough, Brennan played a similar role in the film ""North Star"" which was a film about the Nazi invasion of Russia. Brennan's performance is unremarkable.

Anna Lee plays the young woman who becomes involved in the conspiracy to hide the identity of the assassin, a move which puts her own father (Brennan) in peril. Lee was a favorite of director John Ford appearing in 8 of his films including ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""The Last Hurrah"" (1958), and ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959). She is best known for her work on ""General Hospital"" where she played Lila Quartermaine.

Alexander Granach gives the film's best performance as a Gestapo agent,. Granach was a German Jew who fled Germany for obvious reasons. His first US film was ""Ninotchka"" (1939) and he appeared in several  films as a Nazi (e.g., ""Joan of Paris"", ""The Hitler Gang"")

Versatile Gene Lockhart appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actor in 1939 for ""Algiers"" (won by Walter Brennan for ""Kentucky""). The father of actresses Kathleen and June Lockhart, he's best remembered for his roles as the judge in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) and Georges de la Tremouille in ""Joan of Arc"" (1948), but I remember him best as Bob Cratchit in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938). Lockhart plays a Czech who works for the Nazis, one of Lockhart's few villainous roles, and one has to wonder about the casting for the film, since Lockhart does not inspire the emotional reaction that his character should. Perhaps if he had switched roles with Donlevy the film would be stronger.

Dennis O'Keefe was an extra in more than 200 films, and began getting small, credited roles in 1938. He made another 50 films, most of them forgettable, and then transitioned to TV in the 50s, eventually getting his own show, ""The Dennis O'Keefe Show"" (1959-60). ""Hangmen"" was his biggest role. He plays the fianc of Anna Lee.

Lionel Stander makes a brief appearance at the start of the film as a taxi driver. Stander is best known as Max from ""Hart to Hart"" (1979-84).

Fritz Lang directs. Lang was one of the fathers of film noir and was called the ""Master of Darkness"" by the BFI. More than anyone else he is responsible for popularizing the German school of expressionist film, with  the ""Dr. Mabuse"" series (1922, 1933, 1960), the revolutionary ""Metropolis"" (1927) and the frightening ""M"" (1931) which launched the career of Peter Lorre. Though he wasn't a Jew, Lang fled German in 1934 when the Nazis took over. He eventually came to the US where he made such notable films as ""Fury"" (1936), ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), and ""Western Union"" (1940).  Following ""Hangman"" he made  ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944), ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), and ""Clash by Night"" (1952), and ""The Big Heat"" (1953). While he was never nominated for an Oscar, his work influenced the work of many directors, including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

Bertolt Brecht (called Bert in the film credits) wrote the story, along with Lang. This was Brecht's only Hollywood film. Brecht was a German who, like Lang, fled in 1933. Among his major plays are ""Threepenny Opera"" (1928), ""Life of Galileo"" (1937), and ""Mother Courage and Her Children"" (1938). Brecht was an ardent Communist and was blacklisted in the 50s and became one of the ""Hollywood 19""

The film was nominated for Best Music and Best Sound. Hans Eisler was a German composer, and a friend of Brecht, and wrote the music for several of Brecht's plays. Like Lang and Brecht, he fled Germany in 1933. In addition to his nomination for this film, he was also nominated for ""None But the Lonely Heart"" (1944). The song, ""No Surrender"", that appears near the end of the film was written by Eisler, and the original title of the film was to be ""No Surrender"", but it was changed when a book with that title appeared in 1942.

The cinematography is by James Wong Howe, one of Hollywood's best cameramen. Howe's characteristic use of deep focus and dramatic lighting are well in evidence. Howe was nominated for an Oscar 10 times with 2 wins (""Hud"" and ""The Rose Tatoo""), making him one of the most acknowledged cinematographers in film history. The same year he shot ""Hangmen"" he also did ""North Star"" for which he received an Oscar nomination (won by ""The Song of Bernadette"").

During the McCarthy era the film was labeled ""subversive"" and thought to be pro communist. Writer John Wexley was blacklisted, as was actor Lionel Stander as well as Brecht and Eisler. The New York Times said that Lang ""has returned to the starkly melodramatic style that marked his finest films,"" but also notes that the film is ""too ponderous"" and ""in so far as the picture tries to echo the anguished heroism of a captive people it fails badly both in the script and in the performance.""

The film will be of interest to Fritz Lang fans. It isn't among his best films, but it is certainly watchable even if at 2+ hours it is far too long. Lang's staging, use of light and dark, and camera work are definitely on display. Otherwise, the performances are not especially appealing, apart from Granach, and Lang fails to capture the gravity of the situation as hundreds of hostages are put to death. ""North Star"", a film that came out the same year, and concerns resistance to the Nazis in Russia, is a far better film for people who want to view this era.

Also of interest should be ""Hitler's Hangman"" (1943) which tells the story from the POV of the village of Lidice where Heydrich was assassinated. In revenge, Himmler ordered the destruction of the village, the death of the men, and the internment of the women and children. This film is far more passionate in its anti-Nazi sentiments and has a wonderful performance by John Carradine as Heydrich.",1277596800,,8057,4.8274111675126905
1068436,3,630568393X,"Fritz Lang made many interesting films; this is one of them.  He also made some masterpieces.  However, contrary to the DVD cover, in my opinion, this isn't one of those.  But it remains an interesting film, nonetheless, primarily because it is an historical document.  It is a wonderful example of Hollywood's use of German exiles to manufacture World War II propaganda.

My favourite scene, and the most memorable for me, is near the start of the film.  It is the one in which Dr. Svoboda (Brian Donlevy) is being chased through the streets by the nazis.  He has just shot and killed Reinhard Heydrich, the infamous nazi ""Hangman"".  Nasha Novotny (Anna Lee), an innocent bystander doing her shopping, misdirects the nazis and Svoboda is safe.  The scene is simply very well directed by Lang, and shot by James Wong Howe.

The most dramatically satisfying scene is played between Nasha and her father Prof. Stephen Novotny (Walter Brennan).  Writer Bertolt Brecht gives Brennan a wonderful speech which he recites to his daughter (to pass on to his son) before he is sent off to be killed.  The scene is not only well written and acted, but it takes place in a small, dimly lit room that adds to the atmosphere.

Brennan gives the most compelling performance, but it is not an actor's film.  As Amazon reviewer Steven Hellerstedt has pointed out, Lang schematized the performances.  While this has the effect of easily separating the actors into factions; those who do and don't cooperate with the nazi invaders; it also has the effect of weakening the drama.  Therefore, the majority of the ""Czech"" performances are really quite wooden, while the nazi characters have the more vibrant (though stereotypical) roles.  The result of all this is just as Lang planned; the propaganda is stressed.  Muting the drama has the effect of dating the film, but I'm not sure Lang would have cared about that in 1943.  Nevertheless, it remains an interesting cultural artifact, and a boon for classic film and Fritz Lang fans.",1265155200,4,2014,4.870588235294117
1068437,5,630568393X,"HANGMEN ALSO DIE,is a film directed by Fritz Lang released in 1943  I have given this wonderful movie a five star rating for more than one reason and here they are:

This movie was timely and served to keep  anti-nazi morale up
at a time when there was was much uncertainty about the outcome of the European war.
What now seems like an inevitable victory for the Allies was anything but inevitable appearing back them.

The marvelous directing of HANGMEN ALSO DIE by the great Fritz Lang.
Not only does Mr. Lang use his skills in a enthusiastic and forceful manner, especially when dealing with the Nazis, he knows when to be restrained and use a touch of light humor to make the unbearable seem almost, at times tolorable.

This film is based on historical events, yes, ""the hangman"" really was assassinated, and the exciting story still has time for romance and various
vignettes illustrating how life was for the people under the Nazi yoke.....not to mention how fatal it could be for even the most innoffensive citizens.

HANGMEN ALSO DIE illustrates how when a dictatorship reigns, it's the rats and the informers who prosper.  And very often, as is the final case in this movie, the information is maliciously and fatally false.

Losing your personal freedom is akin to death in many ways.  The only difference is you may still have a chance to regain your freedom, death, of course,  is the ultimate finality.

Rarely have I seen so many fine performances by a wonderful cast of people who are usually supporting actors.  Walter Brennan, the marvelous Anna Lee and so many others. Especially the actors cast as Nazi officers,
many if not most I think it would be fair to assume were anti-Nazi refugees
and ironicaly are hired to portray those that they loathed.  And they do a crackerjack job of it,too.

It is I think the best underground resistance  WWII film that I have seen, even better than THIS LAND IS MINE, directed by Jean Renior, which was released the same year as HANGMEN ALSO DIE.

I urge anyone who has even the slightest interest in the European war to watch this excellent movie, it brings to the screen realistic portrayals of life under the Nazi heel. HANGMEN ALSO DIE is not a documentary but it is a fictional story woven on the loom of historical fact and even to this day an inspiring film.",1251849600,13,2320,4.6495098039215685

7894183,5,630568393X,"This was gripping drama. Based on  the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and the assassination of Heydrich, the suspense arises naturally from these events. There is one main problem- the aftermath of the massacre of Lidice and other reprisals, along with the identity of the assassins, was not revealed fully when the filming was completed. Thus a lot of fictionalizing ! But, even then, the narrative tension and pacing were exceptional .
Brian Donleavy was quite poised and polished as the doctor/assassin; Anna Lee elegant as a top member of the Resistance; Gene Lockhart masterfully fawning as a traitor; Walter Brennan most regal as a Czech professor and the terribly underrated character actor Jonathan Hale bracingly noble as an emissary for the previously mentioned Resistance. Bertolt Brecht's script, Fritz Lang's crackerjack direction, Hans Eisler's evocative soundtrack and the other elements behind the scenes contributed mightily to a film of considerable magnitude and influence on morale in Nazi-occupied Europe !!!!",1488153600,,1033,5.537974683544304

7894185,1,630568393X,"First of all, the movie is awful for its castings of Brian Donlevy, who has all the expressions of a wooden cigar store Indian, Walter Brennan with his Tennessee drawl as a Czech professor, the compelete over the top acting of Gene Lockhart and Lionel Strander as a Czech cab driver with a pronounced Brooklyn accent. Then it gets worse with the title versus the plot. The title indicates an action movie about the assassination of Heydrich. However, it is merely a propaganda movie about the Czech resistance movement, which makes all (but two) Czechs fiercely brave and the Germans profoundly brutal, mindless and stupid. I was totally surprised how really bad it was considering that it had a fine reputation based on the contributions of Lang, Brecht and Howe.",1486771200,,764,4.884615384615385

7894188,5,630568393X,"A classic. Beautifully filmed and directed by the masters of movie making. Done in 1943 when Europe was still occupied and the Gestapo was at the height of its brutal terror, this movie was an inspiration. It dramatizes in a moving, human fashion the importance of solidarity and resistance among the occupied and oppressed. We need more movies like this today--works of art that are riveting, but are are also political commentary that force the public to think and act. Down with Trump!",1481932800,,488,4.891566265060241
