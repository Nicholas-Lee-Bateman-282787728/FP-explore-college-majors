My complaint--I opened up season six and a disc was missing.  Now, how do you miss puting in a disc from the factory?  How can the box get sealed at the factory without a disc?  Who's going to believe you when you ask for replacement of the disc?  Sheese, that's a lot of bucks to lay out for an incomplete collection!",1270252800,,461,4.352941176470588
3056532,5,B0010YVC9I,"If you liked Seinfeld, you'll love ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". I came to the table late for this HBO offering, and after happening upon season two I fell head over heels in love (all over again!) with Larry David's genius. After tax refund time it was a must to invest in the box set of seasons 1-6. Follow the arc of Larry David playing himself (a successful Hollywood comedian/writer/sitcom creator) as he deals with everyday annoyances and outrages. We learn that while Larry has problems, money isn't one of them, and despite his wealth and prestige, Larry still has to deal with trauma, drama, misunderstandings, and mayhem in West L.A. The Seinfeld formula is followed somewhat, with disparate, seemingly unconnected, and often trivial events leading to incredible, crazy conclusions. Jeff Garlin is pure joy to watch as Larry's manager, complete with a remarkably actualized hellcat of a wife (Susie Essman). Richard Lewis is marvelous as Larry's dysfunctional fellow comedian (catchphrase: ""I'm a recovering alcoholic and I have intimacy issues""), and Cheryl Hines is a delight as Larry's oft-annoyed wife who loves to go out to dinner. A single withering look from the fictional Mrs. David can bring me into paroxysms of laughter. A true ensemble piece, Curb Your Enthusiasm is anchored by Larry David's brilliance, originality, and mordant wit. After a tough day at the salt mines, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" punches my ticket back to sanity. It's a gift that keeps on giving!",1268179200,2,1478,5.1115702479338845

3056534,5,B0010YVC9I,"To say that Curb Your Enthusiasm is genius is like saying the sky is blue. The studies of the human character and the idiotic situations we put ourselves through as a culture in America are shown here in full and without remorse. The character ""Larry David"" does everything wrong, but he has his reasons. Most of the time his actions aren't noble and no matter what they harm someone, but Larry usually gets his comeuppance in the end.

I'll concede that the show is a bit formulaic, but there are still many surprises to be had. To me, the ultimate episode of Curb has to be ""The Doll"", (S2Ep7). By this time the show had really hit its stride, and this episode shows how well the formula works. Even the smallest, most innocuous details are important to the plot. The key to the biggest laugh in this episode is a simple plastic water bottle. You have to see it to believe it.

Curb is worth every cent and definitely worth your time. The collections themselves are light on extras with the exception of Seasons 5 and 6 which bring in some bloopers and interviews, but I'd venture to guess there really isn't much to be had behind the scenes of the show. If you're interested in that, cue up this YouTube video of Ricky Gervais interviewing Larry David, but NOT BEFORE you finish watching the series ([...] Spoilers abound!

Be prepared to laugh, to cringe, and to be shocked at the lenghts Larry goes to. Not for the faint of heart or easily offended, as every subject is fair play.",1268006400,3,1485,4.492592592592593

3291028,4,B0010YVC9I,"Funny,funny stuff.  If you are a fan of Seinfeld's George Castanza (Can't stand you!) then you'll love this series.  Larry David is the king.  My complaint--I opened up season six and a disc was missing.  Now, how do you miss puting in a disc from the factory?  How can the box get sealed at the factory without a disc?  Who's going to believe you when you ask for replacement of the disc?  Sheese, that's a lot of bucks to lay out for an incomplete collection!",1270252800,,461,4.352941176470588
3291029,5,B0010YVC9I,"If you liked Seinfeld, you'll love ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". I came to the table late for this HBO offering, and after happening upon season two I fell head over heels in love (all over again!) with Larry David's genius. After tax refund time it was a must to invest in the box set of seasons 1-6. Follow the arc of Larry David playing himself (a successful Hollywood comedian/writer/sitcom creator) as he deals with everyday annoyances and outrages. We learn that while Larry has problems, money isn't one of them, and despite his wealth and prestige, Larry still has to deal with trauma, drama, misunderstandings, and mayhem in West L.A. The Seinfeld formula is followed somewhat, with disparate, seemingly unconnected, and often trivial events leading to incredible, crazy conclusions. Jeff Garlin is pure joy to watch as Larry's manager, complete with a remarkably actualized hellcat of a wife (Susie Essman). Richard Lewis is marvelous as Larry's dysfunctional fellow comedian (catchphrase: ""I'm a recovering alcoholic and I have intimacy issues""), and Cheryl Hines is a delight as Larry's oft-annoyed wife who loves to go out to dinner. A single withering look from the fictional Mrs. David can bring me into paroxysms of laughter. A true ensemble piece, Curb Your Enthusiasm is anchored by Larry David's brilliance, originality, and mordant wit. After a tough day at the salt mines, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" punches my ticket back to sanity. It's a gift that keeps on giving!",1268179200,2,1478,5.1115702479338845

3291031,5,B0010YVC9I,"To say that Curb Your Enthusiasm is genius is like saying the sky is blue. The studies of the human character and the idiotic situations we put ourselves through as a culture in America are shown here in full and without remorse. The character ""Larry David"" does everything wrong, but he has his reasons. Most of the time his actions aren't noble and no matter what they harm someone, but Larry usually gets his comeuppance in the end.

I'll concede that the show is a bit formulaic, but there are still many surprises to be had. To me, the ultimate episode of Curb has to be ""The Doll"", (S2Ep7). By this time the show had really hit its stride, and this episode shows how well the formula works. Even the smallest, most innocuous details are important to the plot. The key to the biggest laugh in this episode is a simple plastic water bottle. You have to see it to believe it.

Curb is worth every cent and definitely worth your time. The collections themselves are light on extras with the exception of Seasons 5 and 6 which bring in some bloopers and interviews, but I'd venture to guess there really isn't much to be had behind the scenes of the show. If you're interested in that, cue up this YouTube video of Ricky Gervais interviewing Larry David, but NOT BEFORE you finish watching the series ([...] Spoilers abound!

Be prepared to laugh, to cringe, and to be shocked at the lenghts Larry goes to. Not for the faint of heart or easily offended, as every subject is fair play.",1268006400,3,1485,4.492592592592593

Amazon Returns suggested I contact the manufacturer (HBO) since DVD's should have a 1 Yr. warranty.  I did this however HBO will not replace the disc because it was not purchased directly from them.
