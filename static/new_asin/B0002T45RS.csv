8031489,5,B0002T45RS,Two disk movie. I watched it on Russian V.E. Day. I really enjoyed this movie. It's about a Russian female Anti Aircraft gun crew. I'll say no more because it would spoil the movie. I only watch foreign movies in their language and read the subtitles otherwise it spoils the movie for me. This film does give you those choices.,1462752000,3,327,4.466666666666667

8031492,5,B0002T45RS,"This is one of the best Russian movies about the WWII. Very sad, but worth watching. Acting is simple and not very professional, but somehow it makes the spectator to believe in the story even more than if there was a cast full of stars.",1359158400,4,237,4.288888888888889
