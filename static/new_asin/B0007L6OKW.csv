2217313,5,B0007L6OKW,this is a wonderful story from disney of the 1970s produced in england.it has plenty of swordfighting and intrigue in the story.,1189641600,10,128,4.863636363636363
2217314,5,B0007L6OKW,"Being Irish, this one was our family favourite not to be missed when shown on the Wonderful World of Disney. It's a pity it's so hard to come by! Exciting and daring, the young prince is portrayed as a young man to be looked up to, just as he was in real life. Being homeschoolers, we intend to study it with the book ""Red Hugh: Prince of Donegal"" from Bethlehem Books for history, and my boys (I have four)are dying to start it! The two that have watched it rate it as high as the classic Robin Hood with Errol Flynn. Great family viewing from a real time in History! I highly recommend it for nostalgic reasons as well as for its value as entertainment, and as for an added resource for homeschoolers.",1163894400,,703,4.293233082706767
2217315,5,B0007L6OKW,"THE STORY: An adventure story with lots of humour thrown in. A fictional story based on a real person, this is the story of Red Hugh, the real Prince of Donegal, Hugh O'Donell. During the 16th century reign of Queen Elizabeth I,  England is at war with Spain while also having a civil war with Ireland. Fearing that the Spanish will sneak through Ireland to attack, they station troops in the countryside. The Irish clans are not pleased with the occupation and plan to rally under young Prince Donegal (played very well by Peter McEnery) to fight the resistance. He suggests an offer of treaty first, then war if it is not accepted. A prophecy stated that when ""When Hugh succeeds Hugh, Ireland shall be free"". When the elder Hugh dies and Red Hugh becomes Prince, many see this as their opportunity.

Spies learn of these developments and Donegal is thrown in the dungeon of a castle the English are using. He is captured and escapes not once but twice. He must fight his way back to his own castle to rescue his family and his sweetheart (Susan Hampshire, having been seen in ""Three Lives on Thomasina"" two years earlier)that are being held hostage by the British. He leads the big battle meant to turn the tables. The film is a bit confusing in the begiining but you quickly find out what the story is about.

BEHIND THE SCENES AND TRIVIA:  At the time production on this film began Walt Disney had not made a full-length British swashbuckler since ""The Sword and the Rose"" in 1953. Walt Disney decided to use an Irish-born theatrical director named Michael O'Herlihy, who had never made a movie up to this time. The screenplay was by Disney veteran Robert Westerby, (Three Lives of Thomasina, Zorro episodes, and The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh), and was based on a book ""Red Hugh, Prince of Donegal"" by Robert T. Reilly.  The casting in the film is superb, with terrific supporting actors including Andrew Keir and Gordon Jackson. Great effort was made to be as authentic as possible for this costume period piece. Maurice Carter was the art director and Anthony Mendleson designed the costumes. Artists spent months creating a tapestry that hangs as a prop but is seen only briefly on film. Music by studio composer George Bruns who based the music on a 16th century Irish folksong ""O'Donell Aboo"". Peter Ellenshaw did his usual terrific job of special photographic effects, his stunning glass matte paintings made it possible to perceive different complete castles in the background of various scenes. The studio originally planned to shoot on location and scouted the real Donegal in Ireland, but the castle was a pile of rubble. They also considered Scotland, but settled on building huge sets at Pinewood studios in England. Their task was formidable with 2 castle interiors and the town of Dublin to build for starters. Specific scenes called for moats, battlements, castle gates, dungeons, long stairways, throne rooms, banquet halls, chambers, peasant cottages and more. The big banquet scene took 200 extras and 3 days to film.

The end result is similar to Disney's ""Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue"" in style but much better. While originally created for television, the final version was a bit long at 112 minutes. So instead it was released to theaters on October 1, 1966 two months before Walt passed away. It aired once as a 3 part episode show beginning October 1, 1967. Released to VHS in 1986, it hasn't made it to DVD at the time of this review.",1146528000,7,3463,4.772954924874791
2217326,2,B0007L6OKW,The story line was bland. Most of the movie was the prince trying to escape from prison and then when he finally did escape he returned home to fight the big battle that was short and unexciting.,1446595200,2,195,4.297297297297297
2217327,5,B0007L6OKW,"I wasn't even aware, except for a few films, that so many Disney movies with actual actors, were made from the 1950's all the way until the mid 1980's.

2217328,3,B0007L6OKW,"Good story but Peter McEnery isn't very convincing as the leading man and is overly dramatic in parts of the movie. There are a couple of slow parts where dialogue and action are lacking but it does have chasing, dancing and swashbuckling though and that makes it fun. This would be an easy Disney update movie.",1433980800,,311,4.571428571428571

2217330,4,B0007L6OKW,"I have never seen a movie I would rate as a five.  Actually I have seen a movie, several in fact that I would rate as a five.  That being said this movie was bought by me for my wife.  Robin wanted to see this so bad she was just one big quiver.  She loves any movie about Leprechauns, puppies, Ireland, Romance, Jilted Love, Fairies, Pixies, Hunks like Sean Connery in his first American role and nearly every Disney film and short since Snow White.  She has Darby O'Gill on VHS, Laser Disc, DVD and streamed,  Just in case something changed.  She saw this in release at the movies and when she knew it was available she had to have it.

The DVD is flawless, came on time, was wrapped correctly and with respect to the environment and has been seen once a week for over three months.  I have no earthly understanding of this, but I can watch Samurai 1, 2 an 3 continuously and think that there are many great films that I would rate as a five and she would rate as a one.

Considering that nearly everyone by now (2015) has a widescreen television, this is just unacceptable.  I'm not going to be a dime-store Ebert and review the film--you can get that information on IMDb and countless other review sites--I'm more concerned about the product I'm being sold since Amaz is, you know, a STORE.",1426550400,2,632,5.247524752475248

2217351,3,B0007L6OKW,"A Disney story of Red Hugh a the Irish Prince of Donegal.  Typical of the Disney movies of the period, you take a real life character and build a adventurous tale around them.  People who are looking at movies for historical fact --- PLEASE --- this is Hollywood, it is suppose to entertain you.  Movies are for escapism from everyday life, they aren't there to teach you history.  You get the director's view of history so don't take it as gospel, just enjoy the film and treat it as a tale.  Sorry, I get annoyed by reviews that want everything accurate - to their tastes.  That being said, this film was typical of the Disney features at the time.  It was not as good as others and that may have been because of the amount of time the film devoted to Hugh being captured and escaping English imprisonment, two times.  Some of that time might have been used to better develop the characters.  It was a decent adventure flick about Hugh's attempt to bring the families together to bargain with England on stronger ground to protect the coast from the Spanish without England's troops doing it on their soil.  He is captured before he can start his plan and ends up having to assault his own castle to save his family and love interest.",1406937600,2,1236,4.477678571428571
2217352,4,B0007L6OKW,"I watched this movie purely for the female lead, its a very good old Disney movie back when they did historical type movies.  Even for back then the fight scenes and plot could use a little amp.  But the female lead who also played in Thomasina delivered very well in her role as the female heroine.",1405987200,,299,4.321428571428571
2217353,5,B0007L6OKW,Great movie. Interesting plot with some good bits of humor.,1403654400,,59,5.0
2217354,5,B0007L6OKW,"Admittedly, the plodding plot leaves much to be desired as too much of the story deals with Red Hugh (Peter McEnery) imprisoned, escaping, getting caught, imprisoned, escaping.............  This type of repetition is hardly the stuff of high drama, but the actors do throw themselves into their roles, making it incredibly entertaining.  There are plenty of fights, enough to keep the title from being a lie.  Red Hugh goes after the bad guy (Gordon Jackson as Captain Leeds) with staff and sword.  There's also a dandy battle getting into a castle (pity it was theirs!).  Lots of nefarious dealings and double dealings, grand speeches, a slight romance (with Susan Hampshire), and humor.  I first saw this back in 1966 and enjoyed it immensely.  It was not, however, a box office smash for Disney.  I've thought of it fondly over the years, glad to now have my own copy and to see that it still holds a lot of sentimental value as far as I'm concerned.",1402099200,,953,4.7682926829268295

2217367,5,B0007L6OKW,"This is a classic.  My kids choose it over and over again. In the old-school tradition there is plenty of swashbuckling adventure, angst, and action but no bloody battles scenes.  The love interest is cute, with her Lawrence Welk style hair-do from the sixties and she is not inappropriate in her displays of affection. Heroes and villains. Days of yore. Castles and dungeons. Horses and peasants. They are all here and adventure awaits.",1395705600,,437,4.972602739726027
2217368,3,B0007L6OKW,"Decent acting, interesting storyline, a little difficult to keep track of the characters; didn't really draw me in, but if you like old-fashioned swash-bucklers, it's not the best, but it's also not bad.",1395705600,,203,5.181818181818182
2217369,5,B0007L6OKW,"A good rollicking yarn, suitable for anyone. It was a pity the English did not trust the Irish a bit more with respect of the unlikely possibility that the Irish would side with the Spanish in their war with Britain. Seems that repercussions of the English occupation of parts of Ireland at that time are still with us as a sore point in Irish-English relations.",1395360000,,362,4.584615384615384

If you want to get someone interested in the subject, especially a young person, this would be a good start.  I read the book, back in the day, and really loved it.  The book explains a lot that was not covered in the movie.  There are very few movies about real historical Irish figures that don't have them as terrorists or pirates.  (The English were really good at labeling their enemies as both.)  This movie was a breath of fresh air",1389657600,2,532,4.43298969072165

2217372,2,B0007L6OKW,"I watched it mostly to see Peter McHenry's work in it- which was great. The leading lady's nose was a constant distraction- just not a natural shape for a human- though she is lovely, I was jolted out of period every time I saw the nose job.

2217387,2,B0007L6OKW,"Ireland. The late 16th century. Fearing a Spanish invasion, the English garrison Ireland in self defense. The native Irish, disliking the presense of English troops, debate whether to fight or negotiate. Hugh O'Donnell, the new head of his clan and apparently the most influential man in Ireland, wants to unite the clans first and then negotiate from a position of strength. Unfortunately, he is kidnapped by the English and thrown into a prison, where he spends most of the movie trying to escape. When he finally does, he rallies his men to rescue his lady love from the clutches of the English. The movie concludes with the singing of ""O'Donnell Abu"", the best part of the entire show.

This is an absolutely ridiculous movie. I didn't expect a Disney movie from the 1960s to be ""Braveheart"", but then perhaps Disney shouldn't have tried to dramatize the bloody Nine Years War. I've never seen a historical depiction so anodyne, sterilized and completely fabricated. This is hackwork at its worst. We see stereotypical drunken Irish noblemen manning the battlements of medieval castles. We see the charming Susannah Hamshire pumping her fists as she cheers on a drunken donnybrook. There's no reference to English goals of national genocide, religious persecution and native dispossession. It's a joke. Why even reference Hugh O'Donnell and the war if they were going to completely eviscerate the story of all factual content?

This is not to say the movie is without_any_merit. The actors are professional and fun to watch and the spirit is strongly redolent of another, more innocent age; not 16th century Ireland, but mid 1960s rec-rooms where teenaged baby boomers rotted their minds with network TV and soda pop.",1369785600,5,1721,5.07773851590106

The main points of the storyline in the film, do turn out to be true historically.  So it is worth watching.  I personally though that this movie wasn't up to the par of the Disney version of ""Roy Roy"" or ""The Sword and The Rose.""  Somehow the acting wasn't as convincing and the lead romantic interests didn't have much chemistry.  It also looked like the actor portraying Red Hugh had too much makeup on or something.  And the dialogue wasn't as clever and filled with local dialect as in the previous Disney movies.  That being said, I still found this movie to be a pleasant one.  It has a lot of fighting scenes in it, so it definitely will appeal to the male members of the audience.

I watched it on my iPad and have to say the quality of the movie is excellent.

Though like most Disney films it has a clean atmosphere, there are the subtle hints of historical prejudice of English vs Irish, Aristocratic intrigue and a cleaned up version of drunken Irish revelry.

The Prince of Donegal does a brilliant job of it even if it often is a matter of life and death. Susan Hampshire plays the beautiful maid that loves the Hugh O'Donnell (the Prince) and supports him in his quest to keep his people free.
There is much backstabbing conspiriacies that go one throughout the film. The acting is brilliant as one might expect for the time and historically intriguing. I always find any movie that focuses on a certain time in history (a cameo if you will) tasteful and captivating. This film fit the bill and left me looking for more similar films.

Walt Disney decided to use an Irish-born theatrical director named Michael O'Herlihy, who had never made a movie up to this time.

While originally created for television, the final edited version came in a bit long at 112 minutes. So instead it was released to theatres first on October 1, 1966 two months before Walt passed away. One year later it aired on NBC television as a 3 part episode show on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, beginning October 1, 8, 16, 1967. Released to VHS in 1986, it finally made it to DVD in 2008. To my eyes, it does not appear to have been re-mastered, but still looks good.",1295827200,5,3673,4.75705329153605
2217411,5,B0007L6OKW,"This is an enjoyable movie.  There is an innocence to the old films- good morals, manners, dialogue; not the modern style where woman is better than man, where sex is overly important, where anyone kills.
This movie represents Hugh Red O'Donnell who today is unknown to the masses. From 1594-1603 he frustrated England in its attempt to exterminate the Irish.
The costumes are excellent as are the other effects.
One never sees this movie sold in stores.
Red Hugh was very religious and from old writings was never promiscuous and even a girlfriend is never mentioned.
Could it be that the  modern mass media who controls television and movies doesn't want the public to know about Hugh Red O'Donnell. He was too nice, too decent, too brave. Why this DVD has not been sold in stores is a puzzle to me. I was happy to obtain this from Amazon because I could not find it elsewhere so Amazon remains the first place I go.
I can watch this movie over and over and that is because the sets, costumes, and acting are good, just like I could watch Song of Bernadette over and over.
This is a good movie to start you off in your quest to learn about Ireland in the 1500s, 1600s.",1285632000,4,1170,4.462616822429907

The Irish vs. the English in the 1500's. This film begins by failing to show a single depredation by the English that would cause you to have any sympathy for the Irish. The film begins with an Irish prince with bad hair-dye saying he is going to attack the English. Lots of bad acting by the supporting cast. The writers of this film make no effort to grab your attention with anything of interst for the first hour. By the time anything that could be interesting happens; you so dislike the boring Irish that you hope the English make short work of them. There is a castle, but the interior sets are poor. Not a likeable character in the group. I remember Disney's ""Rob Roy The Highland Rogue"", ""Light in the Forest"", or ""Johnny Tremain"" being much better than this; though I remember those all being ""B"" movies.

The film is unbelievable, because you cannot believe that real conversations would be this boring. The director had never made a movie before and it shows. Walt Disney was not involved in this film. He was building Disney-World Florida, running his animation studio and Disneyland California, the Cal Arts School, planning a never to be ski-resort, spending more time with his family on vacation knowing he was dying in the final days of lung-cancer. This movie would have been over-priced at $7. The high price is part of the scam. I have been ripped-off by shill-reviews.",1235260800,10,1534,4.741573033707865
2217413,5,B0007L6OKW,"I can't believe Disney continues its policy of issuing these DVDs for such a short window of opportunity that before you know they are there, they are gone! This was one of my favorite movies as a teenager, and Peter McEnery the very embodiment of an exciting prince, fighting for his people. (I preferred my princes as action figures, not dancing at the ball.) Gordon Jackson is a hissable villain, and the supporting cast is solid. Susan Hampshire is adorable, though having a bit too much fun while the men brawl! This is really a great example of the classic Disney live action period - which I only wish had lasted longer. I wish, too, that we had more films like this today - uncynical, exciting, with romanticized leads still grounded in history. Learning more about the real Hugh O'Donnell lead naturally from falling in love with this one. Someday, I hope to visit his tomb in Rome (of all places for an Irish prince to be burired).",1230681600,2,941,4.607142857142857

2217415,5,B0007L6OKW,"THE STORY: An adventure story with lots of humor thrown in. A fictional story based on a real person, this is the story of Red Hugh, the real Prince of Donegal, Hugh O'Donell. During the 16th century reign of Queen Elizabeth I, England is at war with Spain while also having a civil war with Ireland. Fearing that the Spanish will sneak through Ireland to attack, they station troops in the countryside. The Irish clans are not pleased with the occupation and plan to rally under young Prince Donegal (played very well by Peter McEnery) to fight the resistance. He suggests an offer of treaty first, then war if it is not accepted. A prophecy stated that when ""When Hugh succeeds Hugh, Ireland shall be free"". When the elder Hugh dies and Red Hugh becomes Prince, many see this as their opportunity.  Spies learn of these developments and Donegal is thrown in the dungeon of a castle the English are using. He is captured and escapes not once but twice. He must fight his way back to his own castle to rescue his family and his sweetheart (Susan Hampshire, having been seen in ""Three Lives on Thomasina"" two years earlier)that are being held hostage by the British. He leads the big battle meant to turn the tables. The film is a bit confusing in the beginning but you quickly find out what the story is about.

BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: At the time production on this film began Walt Disney had not made a full-length British swashbuckler since ""The Sword and the Rose"" in 1953. Walt Disney decided to use an Irish-born theatrical director named Michael O'Herlihy, who had never made a movie up to this time. The screenplay was by Disney veteran Robert Westerby, (Three Lives of Thomasina, Zorro episodes, and The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh), and was based on a book ""Red Hugh, Prince of Donegal"" by Robert T. Reilly. The casting in the film is superb, with terrific supporting actors including Andrew Keir and Gordon Jackson. Great effort was made to be as authentic as possible for this costume period piece. Maurice Carter was the art director and Anthony Mendleson designed the costumes. Artists spent months creating a tapestry that hangs as a prop but is seen only briefly on film. Music by studio composer George Bruns who based the music on a 16th century Irish folksong ""O'Donell Aboo"". Peter Ellenshaw did his usual terrific job of special photographic effects, his stunning glass matte paintings made it possible to perceive different complete castles in the background of various scenes. The studio originally planned to shoot on location and scouted the real Donegal in Ireland, but the castle was a pile of rubble. They also considered Scotland, but settled on building huge sets at Pinewood studios in England. Their task was formidable with 2 castle interiors and the town of Dublin to build for starters. Specific scenes called for moats, battlements, castle gates, dungeons, long stairways, throne rooms, banquet halls, chambers, peasant cottages and more. The big banquet scene took 200 extras and 3 days to film.
The end result is similar to Disney's ""Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue"" in style but much better. Released in full screen as it was originally filmed that way. While originally created for television, the final edited version came in a bit long at 112 minutes. So instead it was released to theatres first on October 1, 1966 two months before Walt passed away. One year later it aired on NBC television as a 3 part episode show on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, beginning October 1, 8, 16, 1967. Released to VHS in 1986, it finally made it to DVD in 2008. To my eyes, it does not appear to have been re-mastered, but still looks good.",1207699200,72,3674,4.75705329153605

I have been wanting to purchase the DVD, but the cost was about $28, which is too expensive for me. So, I then decided to rent it on Amazon, and I loved it just as much now as I did when I was a young teenager in 1966! I watched the movie on Amazon several times, since it was a 3-day rental, and I enjoyed it each time I watched it! I always thought Peter McEnery was so handsome and such a good actor, and Susan Hampshire is very beautiful. I love the chemistry between Peter McEnery and Susan Hampshire. (And if you like Peter McEnery, you will love watching ""The Moon-Spinners,"" too.) If the DVD of ""The Fighting Prince of Donegal"" is ever affordable for me, then I will most certainly buy it!",1468540800,,786,4.177631578947368

It must had been a delight for the Disney producers to shoot this film in England, with all the premium UK acting talent.  It was a delight to watch and I'll watch it again.

The cinematography was so beautiful and progressive, I kept thinking this film had to have been shot in the mid-1970s.  Wrong  1966.
