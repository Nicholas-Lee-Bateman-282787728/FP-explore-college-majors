1178509,5,B000003KHS,"A must for any Godfather Fan. This is NOT the original seperate film set. This was created for television by Coppola with the scenes in time order sequence. So you meet Brandos Vito after DeNiros Vito. As Pacino has recently said in interviews, this is a different film experience than watching the individual films, not necessarily a BAD experience, but different. The impact of his family on who Michael becomes in Godfather II is less evident when the DeNiro scenes are no longer next to Michaels story, as shown in the original Godfather II. Just my opinion. Very hard to catch this version, unless you have this video set.",1511136000,2,627,4.761467889908257

We have not had any movie to date in terms of mobster flicks that can compare to The Godfather.  It wasn't just about murder, it was about family, organization, and well yes corruption......ultimately the goal was to raise a new generation not carrying on the family business at least not in that way.

I love both movies (Hated Godfather III)  This version is nice because it is on order.  However the irony of the ""The Godfather II"" gets a little lost in this version.  This runs 7 hours but it doesn't seem like it.  Every seen is perfection.  This is one of the greatest 2 movies of all time.  If you never seen this edition track one down!.

1178856,4,B000003KHS,"I've always wanted to watch the first two films in a linear fashion so I was OVERJOYED when I came across this version. The originals are great in their own right but they were kind of hard to follow. This film helped me to understand the plot and characters WAY more. I would probably even go as far as recommending this movie to the first time viewer of the trilogy. I now completely understand why the Corleone family was so revenge-driven. Oh and don't let the 7+hr run time stop you, just break it up into chunks and it is watchable.

I TOOK A STAR OFF BECAUSE the app wouldn't let me rewind or fast forward around the 3 hr mark. It just kept restarting the movie, from the beginning, everytime I tried. I finally figured out that I could play it on my phone, pause it, back out (cancelling playback) of the movie, while still in the app on my streaming device that is connected to my TV, then hit resume, and it would pick it up from the spot I was watching it on my phone. It was annoying to have to do EVERY SINGLE TIME I wanted to rewind the movie because I didn't catch something, but the enjoyment of watching it in this new way almost cancelled the annoyance out.",1483315200,8,1175,4.245535714285714

Example: the hospital sequence should have been extended a bit more to stress the drama and tension. The same for the liquidation of the five family heads. That sequence should have gotten more of  a ""breathing space"" (pun unintended). And Al Pacino should  have received the Oscar for his studied, controlled underacting. A real gem. (Compare this with ""Scarface"" in which he is overly hysterical). Part 2 is overlong and sprawls in too many directions. And if Pacino was overlooked for the Oscar in part 1, he should have received it in  part 2 (with due respect to Messrs. Brando and De Niro). Part 3 is a disaster regarding Pacino in which he is shrill and somewhat overacting. His crew cut therein is out of place, too. I recall to have read somewhere that he was not pleased with part 3 either. Summing up: two commendable movies.",1480809600,,970,4.694117647058824

They gloss over what the mob does to society, to hurt so many innocent people.  it just looks like a family feud.  It's so much more than that.  You might want to check out Michael Franzese's story.

A few observations: While The Godfather established the modern mob genre, The Sopranos took it so much further and in so many interesting directions, The Godfather seem superficial by comparison (not a fair comparison, but it has to be said). Also, Brando's performance seems a little kitchy by today's standards, and while Pacino's is masterful, the movie stops just short of showing his transformation from the inside. All we really get is ""I'm with you now"" at his father's hospital bed, so Pacino's transition from college boy war hero to a brutal wartime don seems a little thin. It's still gorgeous to look at -- the late, great cinematographer Gordon Willis broke some ground with low-key and/or natural lighting.

The added scenes do provide a better understanding of how things transpired.

He has several sons, most notably Sonny (James Caan) and Michael (a young Al Pacino). All actors deliver in an amazing performance of transformation and stoic redemption. Most fantastic is seeing Pacino deliver the performance of his life, transforming from a young, nobody, to the most powerful person in the city. There's a certain amount of blood and violence, but as is said all along, most of it is just business, not personal.

1179752,5,B000003KHS,"First off, this isn't a review of the VHS tapes. Who buys those anymore? I'm am watching the Godfather Epic on HBO as we speak and what a glorious experience it is. Like everyone else, I've seen the first two Godfathers about 50 times. I also bought the Godfather DVD collection years ago. I did not buy the Coppola Restoration because I didn't want to keep buying Godfather product every five years or so. But the Godfather Epic (also called The Godfather Saga, I believe) is the cats pajamas. Seven hours long! Hoo Boy. Includes a bunch of new scenes that Coppola cut that now fit seamlessly into the saga. Starting in Corleone Sicily when Vito's parents and brother are murdered and continuing right through the post war and Batista regime, it gives you a lot of details that help you piece the characters and movie as a whole. Simply beautiful. And it's in high definition. No longer have to squint at some of the dark scenes at night or inside some darkened building. Simply beautiful and bright. The colors just jump out at you.
Apparently Coppola won't sanction a DVD release of this, for whatever (financial) reason. So if you see The Godfather Epic or Godfather Saga come to a TV near you, tape it, record it, whatever, just watch it to fulfill that Corleone need. Just map out an afternoon where you've got seven hours to kill.

It is inspirin that a film of such complex, heavy and captivating subject matter, can be so beautifully crafted. The characters are mobsters, murderers, theives, and yet the audience falls in love with them. Coppola captured the beauty of Puzo's novel in a magical and innovative way, going beyond the pages of the book to imagine the cast members as the characters. Every single character is perfected in Coppola's adaption of the book. Outstanding performances by the leading characters, Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, and Keaton, bring the film to life in the most realistic way possible. Overall, VERY well worth the time and money.

Throughout the history of cinema, spanning over a century, there have been a select few of motion pictures that have been consistently chosen to bare the ultimate title of ""The Greatest Film Ever Made"". The one movie that has most consistently been hailed as such, is The Godfather.

Looking at this movie from an objective perspective it is not difficult to understand why, that is if you fully understand the art of cinema.
Every decade audiences are dumbed down further and further by the mind numbing box office blasters of tomorrow, with more CG, more explosions and more action. Luckily, when it comes to those who's opinion actually counts (namely critics) there still seems to be a general consensus. While some may argue the aspects of Citizen Kane that make it the better film, it is difficult to argue against what does not make The Godfather superior.

Over 40 years have passed since the release of the 1972 classic, and no other movie has even come close to taking the crown. Then again you don't see a whole lot of 3 hour long character study's anymore either.

What elements are combined to make this such a great movie? Simply put, everything. The acting is some of the best you will ever see in any movie, the production and set/costume design is perfect and absolutely nails the films era' s, the music is unforgettable and works like an opera throughout the series, cinematography is masterful and the editing perfectly ties it all together (particularly in one of the final scenes).

This movie may be more and more brushed off as time goes on being called ""overrated"" or ""boring"", but the truth is when the world ends, The Godfather will still be remembered as the Greatest Film Ever Made.",1431388800,2,1883,4.746177370030581

When the franchise blitzed the TV last weekend I decided to rent it because the TV Version always edits out some really good scenes. The one specifically I always liked is when Don Corleone brigs his sons to visit Genko the consigliere at his death bed.  This was a great Brando scene and when I rented it I was looking forward to seeing it again.

However, to my dismay, the version that was streamed is the same as the one that appears each year on TV.  I could have seen it for free with commercials on Cable.  I can't give it zero stars so I must  say Buyer Beware.  If you buy classic films on the net be sure that you are getting un edited releases.",1429488000,5,731,4.246376811594203

1180355,5,B000003KHS,"It is an uniquely American iconic classic for a reason.  Great acting, casting, writing, cinematography, etc. etc. etc.  The undertones and subtext flow through the movie as much as the actual dialog.  The director deserves a great deal of the credit for this but the actors make it work.  It is one of those movies that every USA Citizen should watch and everyone who wants to understand parts of the USA should watch.  It does not apply so much to life in the slow moving countrysides but even if people in the slow moving countryside know it or not it does effect their lives in subtle ways, such as what is in the the products they buy and in more substantial ways such as the overall economy.  Organized crime is a leach on our economy.  We glamorize these figures and they do make for good entertainment; case and point, the movie I am reviewing, The Godfather.  Never forget, they make their ILL GOTTEN GAINS (money) off of the backs of hard working men and women who are just trying to feed and educate their families.  Sometimes these people get hurt or even killed for their involvement.  So enjoy, but don't forget the reality of what you are watching.",1427068800,,1163,4.548076923076923

1180367,5,B000003KHS,"These are two incredible and amazing films. Francis Ford Coppola's direction of THE GODFATHER is something of a dichotomy. On one hand director Coppola gets the details of the Italian-American experience down to the minutest detail. He accomplishes this with great storytelling combing script, dialogue, performances and editing. Unfortunately the actions of these family members are so appealing to audiences that it in effect glamorizes a certain lifestyle and singles out a particular ethnic group. However using his great innovative techniques Coppola created a cultural phenomenon. From a cinematic viewpoint Coppola's direction simply wins the viewer over with such grace and appeal that there is no room for ethical consequences. For years director John Ford decimated thousands of American Indians under the watchful eyes of Monument Valley. Nobody seemed to mind much in the end. Sometimes you are remembered for how well you tell a story and not so much for what the story has to say. Filmmaking can be a very dichotomous business. THE GODFATHER PART II is an amazing squeal rivaling the original. It completes, to some degree, and also extends the saga. Troy Donahue played a brief, but pivotal role in THE GODFATHER PART II as Merle Johnson. Near the beginning of the film Johnson intends to marry Connie (Talia Shire) as he is seen in an audience with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). The importance of this scene is to point out the moral principles of the two men each from dissimilar backgrounds. One, Merle Johnson is a man with an obscure and dubious background. The other, Michael Corleone is an affluent underworld entrepreneur. Is either man better than the other is? It depends on your point of view. That is the point that director Coppola wants to point out. The more I think about it this film is not just about the power of the underworld but about the power of cinema itself. In the first film Coppola won over many members of the audience and welcomed them into the family. When Merle Johnson meets Michael Corleone the audience almost entirely sides with Michael. Regardless of the doubtful Merle Johnson do you think he has any blood on his hands? He probably doesn't. That is the power of the cinema. By the way, Merle Johnson is Troy Donahue's real name. Troy was born as Merle Johnson, Jr. on January 27, 1936 in New York, NY.",1426809600,,2356,4.9072681704260654

It is a very long film and I had to take a break midway through (kind of a personal intermission) but it was well worth it. I look forward to seeing the second and third movies now.,1419897600,,519,4.0

When the movie was first released, attention was mainly drawn to the horse-head scene and the identity of the Italian crooner (was it Frank Sinatra? no actually the original model was more likely Tony Martin). After forty years, the excellence of the script and production values stand out more than anything else. The intertwined plots that make up the second and third act are quantum leap of screenwriting plot beyond any other popular films of the era, and very likely beyond most of what's come out since. The closest approach was probably made by 'Chinatown,' which was made shortly afterwards.",1403568000,6,688,4.939655172413793
1180789,4,B000003KHS,"I'd never seen the Godfather prior to this weekend. A friend of mine asked how I can consider myself a movie reviewer, when I haven't even seen the film that is widely considered to be the best of all-time. He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated.",1403481600,,1603,4.259016393442623

I almost don't wanna call this a Gangster or Mob movie, because to be completely honest, it was such a human story that went far beyond that of a standard shoot-em-up. This was some heavy stuff, for example, the second scene in the movie is a wedding and believe it or not, this is actually an important part of the movie because it introduces you to the Corleone Family.

The family dynamic in this movie was exhibited with such good performances and care; not one family member was irritating.
Surprisingly, at no point in this movie did I wish someone would get off the screen, and that ain't bad.

Marlon Brando was awesome. His character was so simplistic yet menacing in that Gentleman-ish sorta way. Needless to say he got an oscar for his performance, and i'm glad he did, because the deserved it.

Alright now the Bottom Line for a film such as this is always tough; A very large group of people consider this one of the greatest movies of all time and believe me, I can see why people say that, as far as my personal opinion, it's not in my top 10, so put simply, it's a

Now, I don't condone their actions, such as the infamous ""horse-head-in-bed"" (who in their right mind would?), but I have to say: it takes a good combination of elements to make people like this actually likable and even connectable.

We also learn how Michael was able to track down and kill his body guard who killed Apollonia in the car bomb in Sicily.

When Michael sees the news on the paper about his father, he rushes to the phone-booth enters and calls home, while he is talking the dial on the phone is stuck between 9&0 to the upper right. The scene where Sonny rushes to his sisters aid; he leaves in a hurry, supposedly with 3 men in a car following behind, when they arrive at the scene where Sonny is shot dead, there are only 2 men in the car.

1181001,5,B000003KHS,"Along with Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, this is a quintessential American movie, and it's one of the greatest. Coppola's version of Mario Puzo's historical novel about a New York gangster family's rise and fall is a landmark, and it has become so famous it probably needs no introduction or description. If you haven't seen this one, you're woefully lacking in movie background. But just as a brief introduction, it's the saga of the fictional Corleones, the most dominant of five New York crime syndicates in the 1940s. All of the major male characters engage in criminal activities, including murder, but following a mutually acknowledged code of behavior, the most basic of which is based on the law of the animal world: Show weakness or carelessness and you risk assassination. That message is brought home time after time, by spectacularly violent means. Yet for all the monstrous behavior you can't resist caring about - and even admiring - these characters. That's a triumph of storytelling. With Marlon Brando in the title role and relative newcomers Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton on their way to stardom. Nino Rota's score and title theme are now immortal, as are so many pieces of dialogue, including: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" and ""Leave the gun; take the cannoli."" Maybe its most amazing aspect, however, is although it won the Best-Picture Oscar, the motion-picture academy gave it only two others: best actor to Brando (who refused to accept it) and best adapted screenplay to Puzo. That means this classic is among the least-honored Oscar winners, despite its iconic status in the culture.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1380499200,4,1906,5.621527777777778

Michael was loyal to and protected his father and siblings. When you hurt one of us, you hurt all of us.

1181020,3,B000003KHS,"The Godfather is about the idea of family above all other values. It goes about letting us experience this idea with three plots. The main plot is the external plot to Save the Corleone family. Supporting plots include the external plot of Michael becoming an insider of the family and an internal plot of Michael's morality.

Michael starts out an idealistic young man who looks down on the dirty deeds of the family business. In the end, Michael save the Corleone family. But in order to do so, he has become the ultimate insider (the Don) and loses the values he had held so dear at the beginning.

It's a classic story that can be argued to humanize a criminal family by making us a member of it through Michael's transformation. The stakes are laid out such that we have to believe the ends justify the means. This idea, to protect the family at any cost, is taken to its logical extreme in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II and then the pied piper comes calling for payback in the finale The Godfather: Part III. But Part I is what stands apart from its distinctive internal arc of Michael. In the other two movies, Michael's determination and moral center never wavers, we just see the external world's consequences of his moral choices.

1181048,5,B000003KHS,"Ranking second on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest films in America's cinema, the Godfather is considered one of the best movies of all time. The Godfather is also one of the top grossing movies of all time, much like the Corleone family. Paramount Pictures Productions produced this time-honored (classic) film with a total budget of six million dollars. It has since grossed well over one-hundred and thirty-five million dollars. Mario Puzo originally wrote his book, The Godfather, in 1969. The movie was released just two years later in 1972 and because of the success of the film, The Godfather II (1974) and The Godfather III (1990) followed in release.
Many of the male characters in The Godfather act and behave similarly. This is most likely because they come from the same family and are all in the family business together. The main thing that differentiates the men and defines their characters is their position in the family business. However, Sonny and Michael are both in a comparable (similar) situation. Being that they are Don's sons, they are both raked very highly. However, it is the differences in their personalities that led Michael to be the leader. Where Sonny is rash and arrogant, Michael is level-headed and calm. With their nearly identical backgrounds and values, it is amazing how similar, yet completely different these two can be.
The Godfather is just shy of three hours in length. The plot is extensive and complicated, but it is also very enjoyable. The movie opens with the wedding of Carla Corleone and Carlo Rizzi, a couple which is heavily followed for the duration of the film. This scene introduces the family members and the business that they conduct. From there, the movie transitions into a dispute (argument) and debate on wether the family should break into the selling of narcotics, for which they decide to do. Through a series of events, this leads to Michael killing Sollazzo. Reluctantly, Michael took a relitivly small part in the family business up until this pivitol scene where he accepts it as something he is, and has to be, involved in. This is a very important part to the storyline for that reason, making it one of my favorites.
A very predominant theme is this movie was how families and business work together. ""It's business, not personal,"" is said to be one of the most repeated lines in the entire Godfather trilogy. We first here this line when Michael and Sonny are first discussing the idea of killing Sollozzo and McCulsky. Business and family is a fine line that we see the Corleone family dance around several times through The Godfather. Infuriated by the fact that Carlo had hit Sonny's sister, Carla, who was pregnant at the time, Sonny hunts Carlo down and publicly beats him just shy of death. They are essentially business partners, but because Carla was Sonny's sister, he could not let her bruises go. Later on in the movie, when Vito defends Moe Green's actions against their brother, Sonny, Michael tells him, ""Never take sides against the family in the way of the family business again."" The Corleone family is both vindictive and loving with their family members.
The Godfather is considered the leading movie for mob or mafia based cinema. It is for this reason, that there are so many other movies that could be closely compared and contrasted. Scarface, The Sopranos, and Casino all come to mind. However, the level of cinematic prevalence that this movie possesses makes it nearly impossible to compare it to anything else. Al Pacino stars in a number of other movies with similar themes and stories, but if you were to ask someone about Pacino's best work, the answer will always be The Godfather. It is a classic in American cinema and it can't honorably be compared to any other movie.
In an odd, round-about way, I can relate the Corleone family to my family. During a scene in the middle of the movie, the entire family gathers at Dom's house to greet him after returning home from the hospital. It is a seemingly endless family as many different people quickly speak to Dom and the other family members. It was a similar atmosphere when my grandpa died and we had the reception at our cabin. Boisterous (loud) people milling about a small house, all focused on their family. My family is about as big as the Corleone's when you factor in all of the cousins, the aunts, the great-uncles. Although my family is similar to the Corleone's in size, there is one very big difference. While the Corleone's have a family business consisting of murderous activities, our family owns a lawn-mower repair shop. No murderous activities there. Well, that I know of.
In my opinion, The Godfather was a really great movie. It has an amazing storyline and screenplay, but it is also shot in a very interesting and creative way. There are some very violent scenes in this movie, but it was shot in a way that made it seem authentic without being overly gory, or even touching the border of horror. I won't even mention the number of Oscars and the amount of praise it has received in its thirty-one years of showing. I would recommend this to just about anybody who is interested in watching it, however, it does require a good amount of patience to be able to watch a three-hour-long movie. I don't recommend pausing and stepping away from it for very long as it can be very elaborate at times, but if you have the time, I say go for it! I enjoyed watching and I know for a fact that millions of other people love this movie, too.",1370995200,2,5530,4.749480249480249

Fredo, who has neither the brains, nor the brawn and just wants to skate by on his family's name.  Michael, the youngest boy, who the movie is centered around, who seemed to the be favorite to make it legitimately because he was smart and sheltered by his parents and siblings but has all the qualities necessary to be his father's successor; and Connie the self-absorbed, daddy's girl who loves her family, but is content to live a spoiled and privileged life at their expense - four totally different personalities that come into adulthood with explosive consequences.

1181150,5,B000003KHS,"""The Godfather"" is one of the ""must see"" movies that we are sharing with our teens. This is not your typical gangster movie and it won several Oscars in 1972, including ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Actor"" (Brando). The movie gets everything right with a phenomenal cast, perfect settings, and excellent cinematography.

No plot spoilers from me: The story follows the powerful Corleone ""mafia"" family as they attempt to hold on to their influence in post-WWII NY. The character development is allowed to take place at an unhurried pace as this is a movie that jumps months between scenes, giving us a chance to see how they change over time. This also has some really talented actors, including Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, and, one of my favorites, Abe Vigoda (still alive at the time of this review), that were perfectly cast for their rolls. It was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it is my favorite movie by him as well. The action is well spaced throughout the movie and it is not needlessly graphic, but certainly feels realistic. The settings and attention to detail makes it easy to forget that wasn't actually made in the 1940s, really helping the viewer to become immersed in the atmosphere. The cinematography was also outstanding, using great perspective shots and often implying more than what was shown.

This is definitely a classic that is as good as it is said to be.

Highly Recommended!

1181152,5,B000003KHS,"The Godfather is the quintessential example of a movie classic that has survived and thrived in the 20th century. Unlike some classics (such as Citizen Kane), The Godfather is just as relevant to modern viewers as it was 40 years ago. The movie does look a bit grainy, but far from distracting the grain gives the movie a 1950s look appropriate to the era.

The characterization is absolutely engrossing. Far more than almost any other film I can think of, The Godfather creates complex characters with genuinely ambiguous morals. The movie is never so fascicle as to treat any of the characters as good or evil, heroes or villains. The film never depicts the ""mafia"" as a whole is good or evil, but rather shows the tensions and moral compromises of life in the moral grey zone. By the end of the movie, you're not quite sure whether you should feel sorry for the Corleones or hate them.

Rather than go on ad nauseum about about how much I love this movie, I'll just end by noting that this is perhaps the only movie that came out before 1973 - except perhaps Lawrence of Arabia - that general audiences will continue to watch in another 40 years.",1342915200,,1149,4.545893719806763

1181155,5,B000003KHS,"I have to concur with the other reviewers here who not only want to see this version on DVD.  They want to see it in its original theatrical format (16:9 vs. 4:3).  I'm assuming this set is 4:3 because, while I own it, I've not watched it yet (no VCR).  However, I'd seen the tapes before via rental and seem to recall them being 4:3.

When the DVDs came out, I bought them, too.  And while I liked Part I, I hated Part II because of all the bouncing around between events prior to Part I and Part II events.  And even though I liked the Part 1 DVD version, it lacked the historical background that can only be found in this chronological VHS version.  The one glaring example I point out to friends is that, in the VHS epic version, you get to see a young Hyman Roth being introduced to a young Vito Corleone ... with Vito semi-adopting him into his family.  Later in the Part II DVD version, viewers are not aware of this connection.  Roth is not just betraying Michael, he's betraying the ""family"" that adopted him ... making his betrayal MORE than a betrayal ... an ""infamnia"" (the worst kind of betrayal).

Incidentally, while brand new VCRs are hard to come by, there are a number of DVD/VCR combos for sale here at Amazon (and cheaply).  Heck, Amazon still sells blank VHS tapes (grin).  But Amazon also sells ""PVR"" devices by Hauppauge that will ""capture"" the VHS output from a VCR, ignore the copy-protection, and allow the captured program to be saved to a computer (via USB) in real-time as an MPEG2 file (easily authored for DVD burning).  So, before too long, I'll buy a DVD/VCR combo, a Hauppauge PVR, capture this version, and burn it to DVD - before the tapes deteriorate any further.  That is, UNLESS it comes out on DVD (probably not likely).

Bottom line?  This version is, by far, the BEST version of events that transpire in what we know now as Part I and Part II.  Frankly, the content blows those ""parts"" right out of the water.",1338422400,5,1951,4.420168067226891

1181169,5,B000003KHS,"Mario Puzo was a critically respected but little known Italian-American writer when he published the 1969 novel THE GODFATHER, a book he himself described as a deliberately commercial work with roots in earlier pulp fiction genres and the plot and characters loosely based on various New York organized crime figures and associates.  Puzo worked with director Francis Ford Coppola to adapt the novel to the screen, and the 1972 film was a spectacular success, loved by the public, acclaimed by the critics, and receiving an armload of awards.  That success spawned an equally successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART II in 1974, and a significantly less successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART III, in 1990.  And therein lies a certain problem, for the three films have been re-cut, inter-cut, and fiddled with to such an extent that is actually now a little difficult to see the 1972 THE GODFATHER as it originally appeared.  There are so many versions that it is confusing, but the best guess seems to be the 2006 Paramount widescreen DVD release, which clocks in at 175 minutes--the same run time of the original release.

The story, as virtually every film-goer knows, concerns the Corleone family, which is led by patriarch Don Vito Corleone.  The film opens in the late 1940s on his daughter's wedding day, during which Don Corleone receives requests for favors--favors that range from punishing two would-be rapists to securing a film deal for fading star Johnny Fontaine (a character widely believed, in spite of Puzo's protests, to be based on Frank Sinatra.)  Once the characters are established, the film gets underway with mafia trips to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, an attempted hit on Don Vito Corleone, and the Corleone response that leads to a massive gang war, all of this served up with lush production values, remarkably rich ""color noir"" photography, and significant violence.  And then, of course, there are the performances.  Quite simply, was the peak for all concerned.  From Marlon Brando to Al Pachino, from Talia Shire to an unexpectedly cast Diane Keaton, not a single of the cast ever gave a better performance or appeared in a finer film, and certainly director Francis Ford Coppola, in spite of several famous and widely lauded films, never again reached quite the same heights.

Even so, the original THE GODFATHER is somewhat unexpected, and if you haven't seen in some time you may be surprised.  At the time it was considered extremely violent, but in fact most of the violence is implied and that which is shown is seen from a distance, or quickly displayed, or in some other form somewhat underplayed--both the earlier BONNIE AND CLYDE and the later GOODFELLAS are much, much, much more graphically violent films.  What does set the violence of THE GODFATHER apart, however, is that it is remarkably cold.  ""It's business,"" the characters repeatedly say to each other, and the violence involved is performed in a business-like, usually dismissive manner.  Perhaps more disconcerting is how languid and episodic the film is: the pace is generally calm, even to the point of swan-like graciousness, and the story meanders through the lives of the characters without the usual beginning-middle-end structure most American moviegoers expect.  To a certain extent, one can actually describe THE GODFATHER as something of an art film, something distinctly atypical of American movies of the 1970s and even more atypical of American movies as they exist today.

Many critics regard THE GODFATHER as the single finest crime film ever made.  I would not go quite that far--I think the 1974 CHINATOWN and the 1990 GOODFELLAS equal it.  Many critics regard it as the second best American film overall, following closely behind the 1941 CITIZEN KANE.  Again, I would not go quite that far; there are many, many films that vie for the title of ""best,"" too many for anyone's designation to be more than trivial opinion.  Even so, I think it is entirely safe to say that THE GODFATHER, the film that was originally shown on 1972 screens, has stood the test of time--and will go on doing so for as long as motion pictures are shown.  The 2006 Paramount DVD contains nothing in the way of bonus material, and if you want that you'll have to go to a boxed set or some other incarnation of the film.  But THE GODFATHER is good enough to stand on its own without the support of bonus material.  In the end, it is the film that counts, and THE GODFATHER is indeed a truly great one.

1181173,5,B000003KHS,"This is a marvelous way to experience The Godfather I and II. In the 1980s these two classic films were broadcast on television with the events from both films placed in chronological order, and with added scenes not used in the theatrical releases. These include a pivotal scene with Brando and Pacino in which we learn why Michael entered the family business after returning from Italy. We see De Niro's Vito hunt down the two men who hunted him as a child, the violence placed in stark contrast to the gorgeous imagery Coppola created. And we get to see the fate of Fabrizio,the traitor responsible for the death of Michael's first wife, in scenes omitted from the second film. In this video version the portions censored for television have been restored. While Francis Ford Coppola went on record as saying he did not like the films presented in this way, I greatly enjoy seeing the Corleone saga from start to end.

1181177,5,B000003KHS,"As nearly everyone knows, this movie is about a mob family, and the movie is wonderfully crafted in every aspect.  I found it gripping from start to finish.  The focus is clearly on the men in the family, since the female characters are hardly developed.  Superficially, one might be tempted to say that this is just a story about a particular group of criminals, but of course there's much more to it than that; indeed, this movie is an iconic classic for good reasons.

Rather than attempting to write a thorough review which winds up just echoing what countless others have already said a million times, let me first highlight what I personally find to be the most striking aspect of the movie, namely the moral contradiction of these people.  On the one hand, they care for honor, they love their families, they respect traditions, they're nominally religious, they have a sense of responsibility as citizens, and they have a strong work ethic as businessmen (talk about high-stress jobs!).  But on the other hand, they resort to crime, terrorism, violence, and murder to attain money and power, thus being quite willing to disregard social norms and laws as they deem necessary.  I think many of us are fascinated by this juxtaposition because we all experience at least some degree of moral contradiction in our lives (after all, tough moral choices involving tradeoffs are routine), so a key contribution of these intense characters and circumstances is that they make explicit a tension we're all intuitively familiar with.

Another theme which jumped out at me is that the mob is able to coerce even very wealthy and powerful people through violence or the threat of violence.  This is possible because they have an extensive and disciplined organizational structure which enables them to both circumvent law enforcement and apply force which no individual can resist (if you fight back against a mobster, you're fighting his entire mob family).

Overall, this isn't a movie one simply recommends.  Rather, everyone needs to watch it at least once as part of their cultural education.  Also, this movie has much in common with ""The Sopranos"" series, so be sure to watch that series if you like this movie (in my opinion, it may be the best dramatic TV series ever made).",1268006400,,2279,4.90625
1181178,5,B000003KHS,"Marlon Brando is the Godfather and he takes care of family business.  If you're respectful, he'll do you a favor.  If not, well -- swim with the fishes.

Mario Puzo's novel comes to life with the five crime families sorting out their turf in 1946 gangsterland New York.

Behind the parties and the family togetherness there's an undercurrent of competitiveness that rears its head with the Solotso guys who want to make some narcotics sales and thus invite the Corleones for a piece of the action and thus help the family businesses.

Things go from bad to worse for the Corleone family.  Their refusal to get into narcotics gets Brando's character (Vito) shot and near death.  His boys go into action but at the risk of getting killed, decide to meet Bruno for the ultimate show-down.  And hey, let's get rid of that cop that is on Solotso's payroll.

Great film:  1940's gangland is tough, with their Fedora hats and cool 40s Chevy's rolling around.  I almost expected some tommyguns!

I was reminded in the re-watch about the horse's head in the bed.  Don't cross the family!

Robert Duval is Tom, the family's lawyer, basically.  He is the level-headed, logical one who wants to do business without blood.  Mike (Al Pacino) the ""war hero"" wants back in on the family business and to protect his father.  Sonny just wants to blow everyone away!

The film's complex story and interweaving plot make a plot summary difficult.  You just have to see it.  Intense drama with some comedic elements, it clearly deserved the Academy Awards from the 70s.  Character-driven story at its best!

No, it does not glorify the Mafia and teach a generation that being a crime lord is a career choice!  It's a story of family and corruption, risk and torment.

Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay.

Great film!

1181182,5,B000003KHS,"I read the Godfather book by Mario Puzo when I was 13 years old. I think the mastery of telling this story is what started my love to reading. Till now, I still vividly remember most of the details. My passion with this story didn't relate to how good or how bad the characters were, but to how related the delivery of a story to liking or disliking the plot. I hesitated before seeing the movie, as I didn't want to ruin that image I had of the book all these years. The movie, the direction, the music, and the cast were to my surprise a great complement to a great book.

Warning: By describing some details of a well known movie, I hope I'm not spoiling the ending for some People, but as it's a well known story, you can choose to stop reading now:

From the opening scene with Don(Vito) Corleone (Marlon Brando) dispensing favors to supplicants on the day of his daughter's wedding (The Godfather we are told cannot refuse a favor on his daughter's wedding day)  to the closing scene with, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) being greeted as the new Don Corleone, the Godfather is a film of remarkable insight, passion, intensity and breadth set against the backdrop of normal family life.  The traditional Italian wedding celebration in all its joy and happiness goes on outside while Don Corleone (The Godfather) carries on the business of organized crime inside the family house.

As Don Corleone receives and talks with those who have come to him seeking favors, we learn something about his character, about his sense of justice and his all important connection to his family.  The undertaker, who is petitioning The Godfather to do something to the two men who attacked his daughter and were basically let go by the police.  The Don asks him ""Why did you go to the police first?""  The petitioner gives some feeble reply then adds that a friend told him after he went to the police: ""If you want justice go to Don Corleone.""  We see a look of pride in the Godfather's face at the recognition that he is the one who looks after his people.  We are presented with the fact that there is indeed a difference between the law(police) and justice (The Godfather) and clearly justice is more important and reliable than the law.  Amidst this talk of violence and retribution, we also hear the Godfather ask one of those in the room: ""Do you spend time with your family? Because a man can only be a man if he spends time with his family""

As the wedding celebration winds on Don Corleone keeps asking where his son Michael is even though his other for children (Connie, Sonny, Fredo and Tom Hagan the adopted street urchin who is now the family Consigliere) are all present at the wedding.  Perhaps some foreshadowing of the special connection that exists between Vito and his son Michael.  Michael finally arrives at the wedding with his obviously non-Sicilian girlfriend, but yet he remains sort of detached from the whole celebration as he sits with his girlfriend talking about his family and yet at the same time distancing himself from criminal aspects of the family.  Likewise we begin to understand the nature of the other siblings Sonny, the impetuous passionate son, whose brain seems to reside somewhere below his waist and rises and falls accordingly, Fredo the fun loving, insecure brother, Connie the congenial, passionate sister and Tom Hagan the measured advisor of whom it is said ""He is a good lawyer, but he is not Sicilian""

As the film unfolds we are treated to display of some of the Godfather's techniques of persuasion when he is refused a favor by a Hollywood producer.  Tom Hagan, who as Consigliere is sent to reason with the producer says by way of warning: ""The Godfather never asks for a second favor when the first favor is refused.""

 Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, a minor crime figure comes to see the Godfather to seek his financial support and protection to allow him to expand his small but growing illegal drug business.  Don Corleone sees no harm in gambling, prostitution or money laundering, but he finds the idea of the drug trade reprehensible, in spite of the potential profits to be made, so he refuse the request of Sollozzo.  This refusal triggers a small war between the Tattaglia and Corleone families. An attempt is made on Vito Corleone's life as he is shopping for fruit at the local fruit vendor (how normal)

As Don Corleone lies gravely wounded in the hospital, Michael goes to visit his father. As Michael enters the hospital he notices that the men sent to guard his father are gone.  He senses that something is up and acts very quickly to move his father to another room to protect him from the assassins, who are on their way to finish the job.  This is the beginning of Michael's transition from reluctant participant in the family business to eventual successor.  His ability to quickly recognize the danger to his father and act in a decisive way to protect him shows that he has the perception and the ability to lead.

During his ordeal at the hospital Michael is assaulted by a police captain, who is in the pay of Sollozzo and who had removed the men guarding his father.  As Michael, Tom and Sonny talk about the assault later, you sense their desire to revenge the insult, but taking revenge against a police officer it is said will release such a torrent of problems that it should be avoided.  Michael very calmly and matter-of-factly says he will kill both Sollozzo and the Police captain to avenge his father and himself.  More and more Michael is drawn into that which neither he nor his father wanted.  As promised Michael gets his revenge against Sollozzo, after which he is exiled to Corleone on Sicily under the protection of Don Tomasino, until the heat dies down.

While in Sicily Michael meets and marries a lovely, spirited local girl, who is later killed as part of an attempt on Michael's life.  Eventually, Michael arrives back in America, his brother Sonny dead, his father old and ready to hand the reigns of power to Michael.

Michael is reunited with and marries Kay his original girlfriend and with each passing day becomes more involved with the criminal activities of the family.  More and more he is taking charge and emerging as the future leader of the family.  From his foray into the casino business in Las Vegas, to his penchant for vengeance, we see that Michael has the right stuff to be the next Don Corleone.

With the death of Vito Corleone, Michael's father, the shadow of another generation of the Corleone family lost to the cycle of crime and violence looms ever larger.  We hear Michael greeted as Don Corleone and an unnerving shiver travels up our spine.

I have illuminated only a portion of this marvelous captivating movie, but to capture the full impact and beauty of this masterpiece you must experience it for yourself.",1232755200,2,6829,4.674185463659148

Yes, it's violent at times, but the violence is never gratuitous and serves an integral role in what is really a coming-of-age, loss-of-innocence story.

This particular DVD shows the movie in widescreen, which I think is much better for this movie, particularly in the opening wedding scene - you notice a lot more you would miss with the fullscreen view. The DVD only has one ""extra,"" as it were, but it's a good one - a commentary by the director, Francis Ford Coppola.

There is the wonderfully menacing presence of Brando, the complex character of Michael, played by Pacino and the epic ups and downs of the family, played out under the inspired direction of Ford Coppola.

One of the strongest parts of the film is the gradual and irreversable change in Pacino's character; from the respected war veteran at the beginning to a less subtle version of his violent, all powerful father by the end.

2 scenes stuck out for me in showing this beautfully. Firstly a scene in which he is trying to muster up the conviction to shoot the person who has made an attempt on his father's life, the suspense echoed by the sound of an impending train.  Secondly, near the end, the scene jumps between the christening of his own godson (and his own baptism) and the planned killing of all his foes by his design - showing the true extremes of his character and the depths of cold-hearted evil he has now reached.

1181193,5,B000003KHS,"Quite frankly, `The Godfather' truly is technically perfect.  In fact, it is so perfect that writing this review has been an Achilles-Heel for me.  I have wanted to write this review for a while now but have been deathly afraid of failing to do it justice.  It's a rarity to have a film this universally lauded; this universally respected and honestly there really is no other film that comes close to being as well loved and adored as `The Godfather'.  So with that, where do you go?  What do you say?  How can you begin to review a film of this magnitude?

I'll start by saying that everything (good) that has been said about this film is true.

I'll work from there.

It has been said that `The Godfather' is that rare film that just feels right from beginning to end.  Every facet seems to fit just perfect, seems to flow evenly and brilliantly.  Every actor is perfect (and I do truly mean perfect) for their roles.  They melt into character and never break, always elevating the scenes they embody.  The script is tightly woven, intricate and engrossing.  The direction by Francis Ford Coppola may very well be the single greatest directive execution in the history of film making.  His delivery of this marvelous film is really what helps create its sheer presence and undeniable commanding power.  Coppola cemented himself here as one of the great directors of all time.

The film tells the story of the Corleone family.  The family is run by the `Don' Vito Corleone.  He's an aging man, yet very respected and admired.  Known as `Godfather', Vito has much power within the organized crime families and thus is looked to often for aid and support.  When he is looked to for that support in the aid of heroin distribution on the part of the Tattaglia family, Vito finds that his higher standard of morality clashes with the direction the `underworld' is taking.  His refusal to lend aid to the Tattaglia family places the Corleone family in danger.

This forms the catalyst for the films major plot and thus unfolds in a marvelous manor, allowing the audience to become completely and utterly absorbed in the events taking place on the screen.  As Vito's life is placed in danger and his youngest son Michael crosses over into the life he swore he'd never embrace, `The Godfather' quickly becomes the most interesting and highly entertaining film one could possible imagine.

The performances by the entire cast are flawless, utterly flawless.  Marlon Brando effortlessly embodies Vito with such memorable charisma and temperance.  His performance is truly one of the greatest of all time.  Al Pacino delivers his finest performance ever as Michael Corleone.  This performance is of course one that he hones and perfects (his delivery in `The Godfather Part II' is truly the finest of his career) and becomes one with.  Pacino is one of those actors that I feel has suffered in recent years from lack of good source material.  Anyone new to the works of Pacino may write him off as a no talent veteran actor who stars in one worthless film after another; and judging by his recent films they would be justified in their feelings; but when you take a look at where this actor came from you will see that when he was in his prime he was truly brilliant.  James Caan is also amazing here as the hotheaded Santino (or `Sonny' as he is referred).  His performace is electric to say the least.  Robert Duval is also on the top of his game and delivers yet another flawless performance (now here is an actor who has never lost his touch) and John Cazale delivers nicely as Fredo, the `Dons' other son.  His performance in `The Godfather Part II' is much more effective and defined, but he sets a nice foundation for himself here.  Another performance that is fleshed out nicely in the sequel is that of Kay Adams, who is played by Diane Keaton.  Her performance here is subtle and short, but her character is one of the most memorable in the films that follow.

`The Godfather' truly stands the test of time as one of the most recognizable and highly lauded films ever released.  Many critics consider this the finest movie ever filmed, and technically I feel they are correct.  There isn't a single flaw to be seen here for everything and everyone is a perfect compliment to one another.

I don't know what more I can say without either spoiling too much of the films plot (there is a lot to be seen here, yet it never feels rushed or over-stuffed which is yet another marvelous accomplishment) or rambling on to the point of exhaustion so I'll stop here; ending by quite simply saying that `The Godfather' will leave the viewing with absolutely no regrets.  It is quite simply perfect in every way shape and form and is the pure definition of `cinema'.  This is what the movies are all about; great storytelling; and no greater story has ever been told.",1208131200,10,4855,4.66235294117647
1181194,5,B000003KHS,"Perhaps Brando didn't show up at the Oscars because he didn't deserve to win it.  Pacino is the true star of the film and it's more the story of Michael than of ""The Don"".  Brando seems to be acting in a different movie from the rest of the cast and not in a way that's positive.  His method acting approach, so beloved by the critics, often puts him seemingly out of touch w/ his fellow actors.  Brando's overacting is ridiculous when he gets shot just as it is in his death scene w/ his grandson in the garden.  The famous baptism/murder sequence is brilliant as is a sequence earlier in the movie when various members of the Corleone family meet w/ unfortunate fates:  murder, kidnapping, attempted murder.",1206662400,,709,4.543307086614173

1181197,5,B000003KHS,"The GODFATHER DVD

The God father is based upon Mario Puzo's novel of a Sicilian Family moved to the United States circa 1920's.  Don Corleone goes into the  olive oil business, what else would you expect?  He soon learns that it is easier to make money on the wrong side of the law and recruits a small gang of fellow Sicilians.

A host of factors make this one of the greatest American films. First, the directing is impeccable. Coppola allows the story to unfold simply, employing for the most part a static, immobile camera, allowing each scene to unfold like a series of tableaux. Second, the cinematography. Most of the craft of the cinematography went into the lighting, which generates some of the greatest use of light and shadows since the demise of black and white film noir. Coppola also intensifies each scene by using surprisingly little music in the film. Although the film is famous for its outstanding score by Nina Rota (later discovered to have been partially reused from an obscure film he scored in the late 1950s in Italy, which led to his nomination for an Oscar to be withdrawn, an award he certainly would have won), the fact is that the music is used selectively and comparatively rarely. Silence engulfs most of the scenes. And although there are many famous lines in the film, it is driven as much by the silence between the characters as by what they say. Also accounting for the brilliance of the film is the script, which is brilliant for its simplicity. Coppola distills the tale down to only the most essential elements, with nearly every shot moving the story along or imparting a crucial piece of information to the viewer, allowing the crucial tensions of the story to unfold early on. The enormous simplicity in the telling of the tale makes the more complex moments for instance, the crosscutting during the baptismal scene all that much more effective. And any listing of all the reasons for the brilliance of the film leaving out the extraordinary art design would be woefully incomplete. This was one of the first films made that made historical accuracy a high art form, and has exerted a profound influence on any historical film since then.
Of course, one of the main reasons this is a great, great film is the acting. Few films have ever featured so many memorable performances, and no film had featured so many performances by so many actors who were explicitly Italian. In fact, the film was a  coming out  for one aspect of Italian culture in the United States. Even in films that were fairly transparently about the Mafia and crime families in New York and Chicago, ethnicity was completely left out of the picture. After THE GODFATHER, everything changed. The film was Marlon Brando s triumphant return to star status after a series of failures, garnering a well-served Oscar that he turned down. The quality of the acting is shown by the fact that no less than three of the other actors Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan received nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Joel Grey won for CABERET, in what might have been the greatest group of performances in the history of Oscar for the award).
There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER. My favorite, and one of the happier accidents in casting history, was that originally Robert De Niro was cast in a small part in THE GODFATHER. Al Pacino, on the other hand, was wanted for the part of Michael Corleone, but was already obligated for the film BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY. Francis Ford Coppola worked out a deal whereby De Niro would replace Pacino in the one picture. Unfortunately/fortunately this meant that De Niro was unable to be in THE GODFATHER, which meant that he was free to appear in THE GODFATHER II as the young Vito Corleone. THE GODFATHER was a film where just about everything seemed to work out best for all involved, and this illustrates this perfectly.

Highly recommended for fans of Al Pacino, Marlan Brando et. al.and fans of organized crime in America

It seems to look better every year. The performances are stunningly good (Brando, Pacino, Duvall, and Caan were all Oscar-worthy here), the script a genius retelling of the epic novel, and Coppola knocks it out of the park with his flawless eye for framing emotions.

Inspired in every sense of the word, The Godfather is peerless, except for Godfather 2, which is somehow almost as good (and where Pacino enters the Pantheon).

The music, the colors, the darkness and chiaroscuro, the overall feeling of being in the midst of greatness on every level...this is what moviemaking can be. The bar was raised with this one, and in some ways only Apocalypse Now has topped it since.

Coming on the heels of Coppola's incredibly dull The Conversation, this film seems even more miraculous. G 1, G 2, and Apocalypse, all in less than eight years; how many directors have had a hat trick like that?",1192320000,,926,4.732919254658385

It is in fact the best movie ever made and at at the very least the best mob movie ever made(Followed closely by The Godfather part 2). Instead of bludgeoning us with shoot outs and bloody deaths, Coppola weaves a character study about a family. Being Italian American myself, I can tell you this is the most accurate portrayal of an Italian American family I have ever seen on screen! Of course there is violence and when it comes it comes on strong, but the heart of this film is in the performances of every person in this film!

First rate performances throughout and every attention to detail is impeccable. One of the most amazing performances is Marlon Brando's Don. He isn't on screen very long, but leaves us with one of the most unforgettable and powerful characters in the history of film. The films runs almost three hours, but when it ends you will be craving more. It's just a fascinating film and I can not think of any other film that I have watched more in my life.

1181211,5,B000003KHS,"You can't help but come to watch the Godfather with a lot of preconceptions.  It was always a film I just never got around to watching, but when I saw it was Number 1 in the Internet Movie Database Chart of greatest ever films I just had to watch it.  Now I've seen it, I don't know if I'd call it the greatest ever, but it is certainly a dazzling film that stands up to repeated viewings and has quality stamped all over it from beginning to end.  I never realised how big an impact the film had, for example, I didn't realise that 'swim with the fishes' and 'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse' came from the Godfather.

All of the acting performances are great.  Al Pacino really surprised me with his charismatic performance as Michael Corleone, the man who changes from a war hero not involved in the family business to a man at the very heart of his crime family.  By the end of the film I literally could not drag my eyes away from him, he has such a strong and powerful presence, which is amazing considering that I didn't think he was the most imposing of men at first glance.  There is something inevitable about Michael's transformation, and to me it was his own decision - what he does, he does willingly, with his eyes wide open to the consequences.  Perhaps that is the most chilling - and tragic - thing of all about this film.

Marlon Brando was also great as Don Vito Corleone.  He gives truly a unique performance and somehow manages to make his whole face, body, voice and general demeanour take on the persona of his character - something that, unfortunately, few actors achieve.  As I said, all the performances were great, but I just have to mention Robert Duvall, who plays Tom Hagen, the Don's adopted son and right hand man, with a seriousness and depth that was very impressive.  James Caan was also great at the short-tempered son who was never going to be suitable to become Don.  Finally, it was great to see Talia Shire, who was so good in Rocky, play a completely different character with the same level of competence.

One of my only criticisms of the film is that after the wonderful intense love story between Michael and Apollonia ends so sadly, the movie seems to speed up and the years go by too quickly.  I would have liked more explanation about why Michael goes back to Kay and what he was feeling at the time.  I kind of felt that was left unresolved to some extent.

The 'Godfather' also highlights the utter futility of a life of murder and crime.  If someone kills a member of your family, you must kill one of theirs, and then they kill someone else and so on...The 'family' must be protected at all costs, but this protection takes the form of violence, vengeance and control, and is ultimately - and ironically - what pulls the family apart. One of the most interesting ideas about the film for me is what the notion of 'respect' and 'honour' actually mean - and whether these things can ever be gained through murder and fear.

The role of women in the film is also fascinating.  Kay and Michael are in love at the beginning, but he still leaves her and ends up marrying Appollina, with whom he falls in love with in a very different way.  Kay is the wrong woman for Michael as she is too outspoken and doesn't want the Corleone family to continue with a life of crime.  She should have said no to his proposal, but she was still 'in love' with the Michael she used to know before he decided to take over from his father.  The ideal wife for Michael was Apollonia, who would have been exactly like his own mother - quietly raising children and never asking about the business.  Michael's power, magnetic presence and protectiveness are undoutedbly very attractive, and I found myself in the weird situation of being repelled by his actions and yet drawn towards these qualities.  In the long run, though, being married to that type of man means a woman has to remain childlike - never discussing important matters or asking questions.  In addition, the women are complicit to the violence, they know it goes on even if they say nothing - crucially they all know they are raising their own children for more of the same.

Overall, I'd say the Godfather stands up to the hype surrounding it, which is an amazing achievement in itself!  It's a serious, entertaining and compelling film that makes you think.  Like everybody else, I'm sure, I just wish there were more films made that manage to reach these heights.",1172188800,4,4463,4.4888613861386135
1181212,5,B000003KHS,"It is difficult to pen a review for a film as magnificent as THE GODFATHER.  A reviewer captured the feeling well in saying that one gets the sense that everyone in this film was born to make it.  It is as if Destiny herself brought together this gripping story, capable director, and legendary actors to inspire one of the greatest cinematic works of all time.  Very few films allow for multiple viewings among non-fanatics.  But though I have seen THE GODFATHER over half-a-dozen times, I never fail to thoroughly enjoy the experience.  It never fails to pull me into the dark and intriguing web it weaves.  And, though it is three hours in length, I never pause it to attend to the rest of life.  This film demands your attention and holds you captive from start to finish.

Let us begin with the plot.  THE GODFATHER breaks free from all stereo-types.  It is not a traditional ""mob"" movie in the sense that it does not rely on violence to energize an otherwise predictable and pedestrian plot.  This film, while quite violent at times, does not dwell on violence.  Instead, we see the true life of the mafia: a world run largely by businessmen in closed meetings.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is an aging Don of the Corleone family.  He has spent his entire life building up the family from the humblest of beginnings.  Now, in his old age, the Don is failing to keep up with the tides of change and his life is threatened for it.  As the Don's control begins to fade, someone from the family must step forward and ""take over the family business.""  Two mean step forward: the eldest son, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) and the family consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall).  But for all his enthusiasm, Sonny is hot-headed and ill-fit to lead.  He lacks the patience, understanding, and ""reasonableness"" of his father.  And Tom, while close to the family, is not blood and is, perhaps, too much like the old Don to move the family forward in the twentieth-century.

As it turns out, the only member of the family capable of leadership is the youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Ironically, Michael is the favored son--someone the old Don had plans for and the son who could finally break free of the family business and lead a normal life.  Michael is reluctant to have anything to do with his family's business affairs.  At the outset of the film, he does not associate himself with the family, he is in love with a woman he hopes to spend his life with, and proclaims himself to be ""nothing like his father.""  Of course, the tragedy of the series lies, in part, in watching how good men, like Vito and Michael Corleone, become evil men through a series of little compromises.

The acting in this film, as all reviewers agree, is superb.  Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is often said to be the greatest of his career.  Brando manages to breathe life and complexity into the old Don.  Whereas many ""mafia"" films rely on stereotypes and cardboard characters, Vito is someone we would love to have as our grandfather.  He is kind, sensible, patient, and wise.  It just so happens that he is also, at times, ruthless in his business affairs.  Hats off to Brando for being able to convey that complexity.  I could go on about the excellence of the supporting cast, but Al Pacino really deserves our attention here.  Pacino's performance of Michael Corleone is widely regarded as one of the greatest film performances of all time.  What strikes me about this film every time I watch it is the degree of character movement and development that takes place during its run time.  At the beginning, we see a Michael who is somewhat shy and reluctant.  We see that same Michael become saddened and outraged when his father's life is threatened, and we see him coolly and confidently transition into his role as Don, effortlessly and ruthlessly establishing his position in one swift blow.  Pacino manages to make his movement legitimate and believable.  We feel that time is passing and the years are changing Michael--all within the confines of a three-hour film.  That's incredible and Pacino deserves more credit for it than he was given at the time of the movie's release.

Finally, in addition to the great screenplay and terrific acting, Francis Ford Coppola shines in this film.  The film has beautiful direction, beautiful cinematography, wonderful pacing, great lighting...the list goes on.  THE GODFATHER gets everything right.

You cannot go wrong with THE GODFATHER, particularly at the ridiculously low price you can obtain it for.  The new edition is beautifully done and will be an instant favorite in your film collection.",1172102400,3,4647,4.7754077791718945

1181214,4,B000003KHS,"The USA have reached a point of no return in  1972 that is going to lead them to their final defeat in Vietnam and their tremendous decline in the world. At this moment too the consumer's society has produced a new need in western societies, the need for some artificial paradise that could compensate the materialistic narrowmindedness of modern life, the lack of spirituality in mass comsumption. This paper tiger of a paradise is brought by drugs. The drug market explodes, and first of all in the USA. The maffia is confronted to this problem in New York and elsewhere. The older generation of the Godfather refuses this evolution and that brings some kind of confrontation among the five families or clans and the police of course that tries to put their hands on the profit without soiling their fingers. At the same time the Godfather is brought to realising that he has to let a younger generation take over. First an agreement is reached about drugs : drug trafficking will be accepted but regulated. No drugs to minors and in schools, and drugs in priority to the dark ones, the blacks in an attempt to keep this  cancer  contained in the most hated community in the US. This though is not enough to pacify the streets of New York. The Godfather's death is the signal for one of his surviving sons, appointed guardian of the business by the godfather himself, to take over. It is done in the most typical method of the maffia : the five families are decimated at their heads, including the Corleone family. The new Godfather eliminates his brother in law who is responsible for the death of one of the brothers. Brutal, ruthless, pacifying for sure for a while but the promise that with time vengeance will bring strife again. The depicting of power in a feudal system like that of the Sicilian maffia based on the signoria, on the absolute autonomy of each family and their right to defend their territories and their interests by any means including killing, including children and women. Francis Ford Coppola takes a very visible pleasure in this depiction that he complacently shows in its very minute details of cruelty and viciousness.

1181215,5,B000003KHS,"""The Godfather"" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...

His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal ""families,"" and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times...

With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...

While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by ""liquor, gambling, and even women..."" He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""sovereignty."" In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...

The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...

Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment ""Never to take sides against the Family.""

The opening shot of ""The Godfather"" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...

Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:

Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather-- steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie ""big shot"" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...

With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact...",1167436800,4,4448,5.20979020979021

1181221,4,B000003KHS,"Not even Marlon Brando's controversial refusal of his Best Actor Oscar diminished his powerful performance in this equally powerful 1972 blockbuster film that, in the 30-plus years since, has come to achieve contemporary classic status. Even by current standards, ""The Godfather"" still qualifies as a blockbuster: budgeted at $6 million, it raked in $245 million worldwide and $135 million in domestic receipts. Categorized as either a ""crime"" or ""gangster"" film, ""The Godfather"" is less that and more the story of changing times from ""old world"" values that Brando, as head of a Mafia ""family,"" resists. In doing so, Brando's ""Don"" Vito Corleone ignites an underworld war when he turns back on joining competing ""families"" in their infiltration of the country's illegal drug industry. The Godfather himself is a victim of the Mafia bloodbath when hitmen from the competing family gun him down. As the Don lays vulnerable and still targeted for death, youngest son Michael (Al Pacino, in his first substantial role) is forced to compromise his earlier pledge not to work in the ""family business"" as he takes on the role as his father's protector. Just as the film is about the changing of the times, it is also about Michael's emergence from rebel son (at first) to reluctant family ""enforcer"" and, eventually, to Don and protector of the family mantel. Pacino, who was nearly fired from the film, renders a dark metamorphisis from clean and wholesome World War II hero to Mafia don who, by film's end, has a near insatiable taste for blood. Along with Pacino, Brando has stellar backup in a strong supporting cast that includes James Caan as eldest son Santino, the late John Cazale as middle brother Fredo and Robert Duvall as ""adopted"" son and family lawyer Tom Hagen. And while the Corleone's keep it all in the family, so does director Francis Ford Coppola. He cast sister Talia Shire as the Godfather's only daughter and his father to score the film. As the Don's ""little girl,"" Connie, Ms. Shire's character development in this film is (if there can be any criticism) unsatisfying in much the same way as it is for Diane Keaton's character as Michael's long-suffering fiancee and, later, as Mafia wife. Only in the franchise's subsequent sequels did Shire's and Keaton's characters evolve, Shire's to rebel sister in the second film to ""godmother"" status in the third, and Keaton to emerging unsatisfied Mafia wife in the second film to independent ex-wife in ""Godfather Part III."" Along with Brando's Best Actor statute, the film won Oscars as Best Picture, best director for Coppola and best screenplay for both him and Mario Puzzo (on whose novel the screenplay was written). The film was given an R-rating for its violence (no fewer than 11 killings) and a brief bare-breast shot (of Michael's doomed first wife). Even more than three decades after its release, ""The Godfather"" remains as perfect as it was hailed in its day, and it still makes us think of ""family"" in a non-traditional way.",1151798400,,3002,4.970178926441352
1181222,5,B000003KHS,"At just under four hours, this is a long film, but one that holds the viewer riveted. Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, comes back from World War II as a hero. His family are leading mobsters and it is a life he wants to reject, but his hand is forced when his father, Don Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is shot down in the street. Slowly and reluctantly, he gets sucked into the vortex of the Mob, proving himself every bit as ruthless as his rivals.

This film reveals perfectly the analogy between 20th Century gangsters and the aristocracy. Not the effete aristocracy of the modern age but that of antiquity: when brutality and nobility went together; when power came from brute strength. This is what Thomas Paine had to say about the aristocracy:

""It could have been no difficult thing....for a banditti of ruffians to overrun a country [and] their power being thus established, the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of monarch and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings."" 'The Rights of Man.'

If Don Corleone had been born in the pre-democratic age, his descendants would now have lands and respectable titles. Don Corleone insists people call him Godfather: In a previous age it would have been King, Duke, Baron, or Prince. It all means the same. Splendour sits side by side with violence. There are no ethics, only power. Everything else is a faade.

This was made in the 70s, when Coppola made genuinely great films. It's a compelling story beautifully told. The pacing is steady but never slow. The performances are flawless: the cinematography beautiful. Come the 80s, his genius would desert him. However, his classic films are still around and show just how powerful a medium film can be. The Godfather is ample evidence of this. This is one of the great movies of the 20th Century.",1151280000,3,1837,4.713395638629284
1181223,5,B000003KHS,"Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER (1972) may be the best movie ever made that no one in my family wants to borrow from my large private DVD collection.  They say it is too long  (it really isn't) and much too violent (it is).  Ironically, the graphic violence may be one reason we have the version of THE GODFATHER that gangster film devotees love so much.  Listen to the illuminating commentary by Coppola on the DVD.  He was young and constantly under pressure from Paramount executives to shoot the movie faster and make it more violent, or face firing.  The exquisite wedding sequence in reel one is a good example--executives demanded it be filmed in three days or else, so scenes with Al Pacino and Diane Keaton talking at a side table were shot at night with tons of light to look like daytime and to cinematographer Gordon Willis' justified anger as a perfectionist.  And a later scene with Talia Shire getting beaten up by her husband was shot by Coppola with the fear of being replaced if he did not add more violence to the movie.

It was a low-budget film ($2.5 million) that blossomed up to $6.5 million.  The Hollywood exterior scenes with John Marley were done with long shot doubles and a second unit crew.  (But the infamous horse's head in bed scene WAS done by Coppola in New York.)  Ironically, the first week of filming went very smoothly and included two full nights to film the killing of the violent police captain (Sterling Hayden) and his henchman in the restaurant.  In any event, the first GODFATHER film was a very hard movie to make.  Producer Robert Evans, coming off LOVE STORY, even wanted to replace Nino Rota's incomparably lovely score with something more schmaltzy, until an enthusiastic public screening of the movie convinced him to stay with Rota.

At 175 minutes, THE GODFATHER a towering gangster film achievement with flawless performances and solid writing.  (The studio executives were so brutal to Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role that he refused to come back for the 1974 sequel, even for just a cameo.  And the ""shirts"" also were not very keen on Al Pacino as Michael, not even after the restaurant massacre in week one.)  Note the plotting and the way light and dark contrast--not just dramatically, but also visually.  Take the opening reel and the way undertaker Bonasera is talking to Vito Corleone (Brando, and an improvised cat to stroke as he talked) in a darkened study, all golds and browns, while a gorgeous sun-lit wedding reception for Vito's daughter is taking place outside.  The whole movie has juxtapositions like this to make it a special gangster film.  All the way to the last reel, where the baptism of Michael's infant son (really baby Sofia Coppola!) in a cathedral is intercut with terrible murders happening all over greater New York City.

Dean Tavoularis' production design and Anna Hill Johnstone's costumes deserve special mention in their extraordinary detail, especially the shops in Little Italy and just the right clothes for everyone on the sidewalks and in the streets.  Their work is magnificent.

And I love the Sicily scenes with Al Pacino's Michael hiding out for a couple of years after killing the police captain in the New York restaurant.  Michael falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian bride, with Nino Rota's exquisite ""Love Theme"" music on the soundtrack.  Their evocative wedding will contrast against the bride being subsequently blown up in a car, which sends Michael back home to Diane Keaton's nurturing Kay.

I also love a later scene that a moron Paramount executive wanted cut out because it allegedly did not advance the plot--the death of Brando's Vito Corleone of a heart attack while playing in a tomato vineyard with his young son.  Fortunately, this classic scene stayed in and adds great beauty on either side of darker scenes.  In fact, Coppola says on the audio commentary that Robert Evans eventually came to his rescue when Evans saw that he had a potential masterpiece and blockbuster on his hands--Evans insisted that scene after scene be put back into a movie that was originally about two hours and slowly creeped up to its present 175 minutes.  Hollywood moviemaking is a crapshoot and a crazy, stressful game.  God must have been looking down on the 30 year old director and co-writer more than a few times.

In the final analysis, it is the constant blending of romance and violence, both dramatically and visually, that makes THE GODFATHER such a special gangster film masterpiece.  It blends flawless acting, strong writing, authoritative direction, world-class sets and costumes, magnificent (and very underrated) photography, and the loveliest of lovely music scores to be one of the great works of art of the American cinema.

1181224,5,B000003KHS,"I've read the original book version by Mario Puzo, and I must say the movie is suprisingly just as good if not better than the book itself.

The Godfather is one of the most realistic movies about the mafia ever created. Marlon Brando plays the notorious Don Vito Corleone, which became one of his most famous role ever played. His charismatic yet deadly look combined with his experienced acting skill made the character he was playing almost real. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, the son of Don Vito Corleone who eventually gets involved with ""family business"". Though the Al Pacino in the movie was young, he displayed acting skills which would soon become unrivaled.

The movie depicts the power and corruption rooted in the society by the Mafia. Whether it is the movie and music industry, local law enforcements, or the vatican bank lived in fear under the reign of the notorious mafia at that time. Much detail was placed in showing how the mafia worked. But I believe that the movie was so successful because it tackled the most interesting and difficult thing to depict, which was the feelings and experience of people like Don Vito Corleone and Don Michael Corleone. The movie shows, im my opinion, unrivaled depiction of ""realistic"" mafia life, making us wonder even more and more about the true characteristics of these people in real life.

Produced in the 1970s about a story whose settings take place in post World War II New York, Coppola skillfully transformed Mario Puzo's The Godfather into a successful movie with Hollywood giant Maron Brando and America's favorite Al Paccino playing the roles of a mafia leader and his younger son who took over family business after the father became too old to handle the business and the elder son who was slated to take over was shot dead in one of the mafia settling scores activity.

The success of the movie made its producers release parts II and III. However, the first one of this sequel remains the jewel of The Godfather crown.

Vast literature has been written about the anthropological and sociological manifestations of this movie. Two main themes, however, have found their ways to the forefront. First, the movie captures the mood during 1970s America during which most communities where abandoning civil rights movements in favor of promoting retrieving their different community character and the Italian-American community was no exception. Second, the movie has been often compared to the rise and fall of dictatorships around the world especially in Syria where the life of its late dictator Hafez Assad looks almost identical to The Godfather. Assad was grooming his elder son, Bassel, was killed in a car accident. This forced Assad to groom his second son, Bashar, who was not into his family's business but was later forced to succeed his father. In both the Godfather and Syria, things eventually slip from the hands of the second generation and become more difficult for the successors to keep things as they were during the days of their fathers.

Rated R for violence and language.

""The Godfather"" has the word classic written all over and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques ""The Godfather"" has not been as revolutionary as ""Citizen Kane"", but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.  ""The Godfather""'s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in ""The Godfather"". The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.  But to say that ""The Godfather"" is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.

As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was ""The Godfather"". Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.

The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.  However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.  To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.

There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.  There has been much speculation on how the events in ""The Godfather"" novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos? of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane, for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people.  The cinematography of ""The Godfather"" is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.  The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",1146355200,2,6046,4.88390243902439

It's like all the planets were aligned and brought perfection together. The script, the cast, the director, the time.
Marlon Brando is magnificent as Don Vito Corleone, mafia lord of one of New York's five crime families. That Brando could so perfectly display a gentleness of heart and yet a violence of the soul within the same man is astounding. You are compelled to love and adore Don Corleone as well as despise him, only Brando could do this. What girl would not want him for her daddy, what man would not be devastated to have him as an enemy ? How could this be topped ?  By Al Pacino.
As Michael,the youngest son of the Don who wanted nothing to do with the dirty business of his father, declaring to his girlfriend when speaking of his father's ""business"", ""That's my family, Kay. It's not me."". Nobody wanted Pacino to play Michael, no one but Pacino and Coppola, and Coppola fought hard to get him in the movie. Every major male star in Hollywood wanted this part. A little trivia ** Pacino's grandparents were from Corleone, Sicily.
Pacino is astounding. How can you put on celluloid the slow hardening of a man's heart ? This is Pacino's task and he captures the hardening of Michael's heart, we can almost see the warmth in his eyes, cool. When history looks back on The Godfather film 50 years from now,it will be said that giants walked the earth in regard to the greatness of this film.

I would estimate I have watched this film 30 times, and each time it is as absorbing in all its detail as the first time - and I just keep seeing more.  Every single actor gives a first rate performance, from the young Diane Keaton - what an extraordinary talent and beauty! - to the worn down Marlon Brando, whose aging shocked my parents.  While this is a kind of pseudo-presidency (or kingship), this is a fundamental study of the wielding of power, the importance of family loyalty, and the brutality of the world.

1181230,5,B000003KHS,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to see 'The Godfather' but now that I've finished I feel complete in a way, like I've acomplished something.  I guess that may be that up until this point I didn't know why so many people LOVE this film, and now that I have experianced it I can agree with the masses that you rarely watch a film as COMPLETE as 'The Godfather'.  By that statement I mean that, from start to finish, every line spoken, every scene shot, every moment caught on film feels just right.  Nothing feels contrived or forced, nothing feels out of place or 'added' but everything feels natural and, well, perfect.  Now I really don't know what to say...I mean, how do you review a masterpiece.  It almost feels wrong to say anything but ""see this movie if you haven't already"" for fear that something you say will take away from the film, but I will try my best.  First of all the story is classic, and no, I have not read Puzi's novel, but I have decided to order it and will read it shortly, but the story regardless if you've read the novel is still gripping.  Marlon Brando, in his most critically aclaimed role, plays 'Don' Vito Corleone, the head of his mafia family.  The story follows as the Don is asked by the Tattaglia family for his aid in trafficing narcotics throughout New York.  Now Vito is a man of the old country, and he believes narcotics to be a dirty business and so he refuses, politely, to aid the family.  This causes problems, and after the Don is attacked and hospitalized his family struggles to exact their revenge while taking care of the responcibilities their father can no longer tend to.  Vito's son's all take seperate approaches to the crime.  Sonny (James Caan) is hotheaded and placed in charge in his father absence.  He wants to strike while the iron is hot sort-a-speak.  Tom Hagen, the Corleone adopted son (Robert Duvall) is the sensable consultant to the family (and family lawyer) and he advises Sonny to take his time and think things through.  If he strikes fast and hard he may bring upon them the vengence of the other mafia family's.  Michael (Al Pucino) is the youngest son, and up until this time he had nothing to do with the family business, and he had no desire to get involved.  He has just returned from war and is courting Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), but when his fathers life is placed on the line he has a change on heart and exacts his revenge on the Tattaglia's resulting in a feud or war between the family's and causes Michael to flee to Sicily for his safty.  Events take place over the years that take a toll on the family, but the strength of the Corleone's pulls through and by the end of the film, as Michael realizes his place in the world and becomes the new 'Don' we, the viewer, understand the importance of this film and the power it holds.  From beginning to end there is only perfection.  I can't say anything more, and quite frankly I shouldn't have to.  Watch this movie for there is no film that even comes close to this film...probably the most deserving film to ever walk away with the top honors at the oscars.",1145836800,,3104,4.439153439153439

1181234,5,B000003KHS,"THE GODFATHER is universally considered one of the five greatest films ever made (amazingly, its twin, GODFATHER II shares that honor). As a Shakespearean tale of kingship, THE GODFATHER is less a gangster film than an archetypal prose opera about inner strength and moral decay.

Marlon Brando plays Don Vito Corleone, the bulldog-faced, gravel-voiced ""Godfather"" of the title. In this Oscar-winning performance of a lifetime, Brando's Don Vito is a study in the sere Will to Power. Without raising his voice and with barely raising an eyebrow, he commands life, death and fortune. A man who knows who he is at all times, Don Vito judiciously employs respect and refined fear to rule over his world---violence is only a last resort when his Family is directly threatened.

The external threat to his world is represented by Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), a heroin trafficker backed by a rival Family. Sollozzo's failed attempt to kill the Godfather plunges their world into a bloody war of vendetta and counter-vendetta.

The internal threat is far more pressing: The Godfather has no heirs. The eldest son, Santino (James Caan) is a tornadically unstable and vengeful slaughterer; the second son, Fredo (John Cazale) is weak and dull-witted; the adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duval) lacks the royal bloodline; the son-in-law, Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo) is an adulterous, wife-beating drunkard with no respect for Family; and the third son, Michael (Al Pacino) is prodigal, having turned his back on his father's universe.

The Godfather's brush with death brings Michael back into the fold. The virtually unknown Pacino established himself as a commanding screen presence with this darkly quiet, intense and utterly honest portrayal of an unwilling child who inherits his father's mantle and ultimately makes it his own.

Pacino, quite simply, was born to play this role. It is as hard not to imagine Al Pacino as Michael Corleone as it is to imagine the alternate choices, Robert Redford or Ryan O'Neal, playing the part. (Hollywood's ignorance of the rules of the inner world of the Sicilian Dons was reflected in the explanation that the blond Michael would have been 'northern Italian.')

Pacino slowly and subtly transmogrifies from the innocent and prodigal son into the Godfather after his slaying of Sollozzo, his exile to Sicily, and the sudden death of his father, which unleashes a brief but terrible purge which consumes his enemies in their entirety.

Despite his accession to the kingship, Michael never attains his father's sense of serenity-in-lordship, and immediately begins his decline, chronicled in THE GODFATHER II.

Director Francis Ford Coppola draws on his innate understanding of Italian family and cultural life to create this brilliant, entertaining and hypnotic period piece, which is based on author Mario Puzo's novel and screenplay. Deserving of every accolade, THE GODFATHER is reflective of the best and the worst of the human condition.",1140825600,5,2974,5.246315789473684

1181236,5,B000003KHS,"1972 Best Picture about a Sicilian organized-crime family undergoing transition during post World War II.  Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando, once the most powerful Don in the Mafia, is nearing retirement and plans to pass the reins.  The rising narcotics racket challenges Vito's druthers however, to maintain his interests' status quo in imports and politics-and threatens the family's existence when an assassination attempt puts Vito in hospital intensive care.

The Corleone family dealing with the crisis is where the story shines, while their business provides an intriguing edge, the human drama among the siblings is the main feature.  Most important is the heir and the events that unfold to reveal a less than clear case of who will be Vito's successor.  The eldest Sonny, played by James Caan, has an explosive temper that compromises his better judgment; Fredo, played by James Cazale, lacks the necessary leadership qualities; and the youngest son Michael, played by Al Pacino, has distanced himself from the family with intentions for a legitimate career.  Michael is the most interesting, having returned from duty with the Marines, he displays dynamic qualities after Vito's hit and commits to a dramatic turn-around in his ambitions out of loyalty to the family.  Mike goes on to perform a service that will change his life and the family's future forever.

This is an excellent movie; the story, actors and production are a pleasure to watch.  Actor Robert Duvall turns in an excellent supporting role as Tom Higgins, the adopted son who serves as Vito's legal counselor; and Al Lettieri is menacing as Virgil Sollozzo, the trafficker who tries to assassinate Vito to open the way for his narcotics business.  Director Francis Ford Coppola set the standard for this genre in 1972 and is probably the inspiration for follow-on features such as ""GoodFellas"" and ""The Sopranos.""

The movies influence is immeasurable and its status as a cultural icon is firmly entrenched in our collective consciousness.  But what makes this movie great?  It really has a simple plot: an aging mafia leader wishes to hand over his crime empire to one of his sons.  Through fate and happenstance, the one son, who originally wants nothing to do with the ""family business"" takes over and becomes the Don after the old man's death.  In and of itself, this story arc is at least as old as Shakespeare, but the way Coppola and Cinematographer Gordon Willis film and tell the story are what gives the Godfather its timelessness.  The story is beautiful in the way it juxtaposes moral attributes such as loyalty, self sacrifice and honor with terrible corruption, cruelty and unthinkable violence.  After the movie came out many viewers may have gotten a mixed message.  As such, many may have seen the good attributes of the characters as almost justifying their terrible actions.  Therefore, in order to be artistically and philosophically honest, Coppola had to make the second part.  At the end of the Godfather, Part I, we are almost sure that Michael has damned himself.  However, at the end of the second part, we are positive.  Thus, ""for what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?""

1181241,5,B000003KHS,"This film, without a doubt, is one of the most popular films in history.

""The Godfather,"" as we all know, is based on an early 70's novel by

Italian author Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of one family and it's

destiny...the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (the Godfather) is the head

of the Corleone family and runs his 1940's New York empire with Mafia

justice. The story begins with the wedding of Vito's daughter, Connie,

to Carlo Rizzi. Present in the wedding include Vito's sons and heirs,

Sanito (""Sonny""), Fredo, and, most famous of all, Michael, the

reluctant heir to his father's business.

While the Corleone family is wealthy and fortunate, they also have some

rival Mafia families, such as the Tattaglia, Sollozzo, Brasi, and son

on and so forth. Tragedy occurs when Vito is injured by the gun of one

of the rivals, and thus, a tale of the mafia, bloodshed, and family

takes place. ""The Godfather"" chronicles the story of a family trying to

stay on top during a dog-eat-dog era, revenge and murder, family and

trust, as well as the rise of Michael Corleone as the don (head) of his

family and how he avenged his entire family from all rivals.

Puzo's novel was brought to the screen by legendary director Francis

Ford Coppolla, whose daughter, Sophia, is now following his footsteps

and unleashing her directional legacy with films like ""Virgin Suicides""

and ""Lost in Translation."" F.F. Coppolla uses his talents to tell

Puzo's story through actors and actresses.

Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone and brings a fine Michael Corleone,

portraying the his character well. Pacino shows the evolution of

Michael from the reluctant young man to this ruthless don and willing

godfather like his dad. Diane Keaton also stars in this movie, playing

Michael's non-Italian wife, Kay Adams. But, of course, the title role

(the Godfather) is given to the recently-deceased legend Marlon Brando.

Brando is truly Vito Corleone, bar none, and you better respect him or

else.

Other than the actors and actresses, the sets are good, too. This is

not a cheery and bright film but a dark and gloomy epic. The grim and

gritty 40's-50's NYC sets reflect the brutality of that time, when

gangs were the rulers of New York's streets. However, the Corleone

family's Italian heritage is also reflected, and who's better in making

Italian music than Italian composer, Nino Rota? The Godfather theme

song (""Speak Softly, Love"") is just as classic as the film.

""The Godfather"" was released in 1972. It was a critical and commercial

success, winning several Oscars, even, best of all, Best Picture. It

was followed by 1974's ""Godfather, Part II,"" and 1990's ""Part III."" The

first sequel was just as acclaimed as the first while the latter had

mixed reviews. But still, all of these films are regardless as classics

by critics and the movie-going public. Many consider this film to be

the greatest film of all time.

Especially Marlon Brando with that trademark ""crooked mouth"" and ice-cool Al Pacino shine.

1181246,5,B000003KHS,"I believe that a confluence of factors make this the greatest film ever. A young and starving Coppola, steadfast in his artistic integrity, fighting for his vision of exactly what the film should be over the objections of studio bigwigs.

In retrospect, a cast of truly brilliant actors, that likely could never again be duplicated. At the time, Brando was the great know quantity, but in decline and perfectly cast (initially with the studio at odds with Coppola with regards to hiring Brando) as a dying Godfather. The rest of the hall of fame cast was, relatively speaking, not particularly well-known at the time. As a result, the actors themselves do not detract from the film. We are not watching Pacino or Duvall give a typical ""Pacino"" or ""Duvall"" performance, but rather we are watching them as the characters themselves.

Putting aside for a moment the ruthless and immoral nature of the Mafia, the cinematography, editing, and overall pace of the film create an atmosphere where the viewer becomes immersed in a film that has a ""home movie"" type quality, where you are almost there and you actually feel for some of these people. No small feat considering the subject matter at hand and a tribute to Coppola's deft early touch. But Coppola's direction doesn't let the viewer get too attached as he provides an underlying, yet subtle, fatalistic tension throughout the whole affair.

For me the ending is the icing on the cake, one of the great endings of all time. Michael isolated, his dreams shattered, the valor of his uniform from the early part of the film overshadowed by the darkness of his role as the Godfather, the door closes shut.",1123545600,,1653,4.833922261484099

Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is the finest work he ever did, and may be the finest work any actor ever did.  He doesn't stand alone.  The rest of the cast is tremendous as well.

There is one obvious fault in the movie.  It idealizes the Mafia.  With such a glorious example of a mafia don as Vito Corleone, we are given the impression that the Mafia is made up of brilliant and sensitive heroes, at least in this one character.

From the first scene, Connie's wedding, where the don grants justice to Bona Sera for his daughter's vicious assault, the Marlon Brando character stands about as tall as Lincoln.  I really wouldn't expect to find a man that amazing.  I'd expect to find greedy selfish violent men running the Mafia, not wonderful men like Corleone.

That's my only criticism.  The story is beautifully crafted.

Oh wait, one more criticism.  I think that Michael should have leveled with Kay at the end.  He had ample reason for his decision, and she would have understood and, if not approved, at least considered staying with him through the years.

Al Pacino was a unknown actor when he performed as ""Michael Coreleone"" in the Godfather...after his performance in the movie ""The Godfather"" he didn't stay unknown.

I'd say the Godfather was the movie perfomance which made Al Pacino the succesfull actor he's been from 1972-1995. Al Pacino career as a big shot actor depended on the sucess of the movie. Because the Godfather was sucessfull it paved the way for more ""Al Pacino"" classics such as ""the Godfather 2"",and ""Scarface"".

The movie takes place in 1945. The movie starts with Don Vito Coreleone taking request from people who've come to him on his daughters wedding day. He fullfills a request for his Godson, Johnny Fontane which is to get him a role in a hollywood production.

Nobody can have a truly enviable dvd collection without this 1972 cinematic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and featuring a stunning array of some of the film world's greatest talents, including Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a host of others. Unlike most film addaptations, the film stays true to Mario Puzo's ingenius original novel. There are very little differences (I'm sure there are some) between the book and the novel (at least from a general outlook).

And back to the acting. It is evident from his first line that Brando never had a finer role than beleagured mob boss Don Vito Corleone. Brando packs an emotional wallop into his performance. From this performance it's easy to see why all of Hollywood still worships at his feet. Al Pacino as his son Michael Corleone proves that he truly was worthy to be Brando's successor, and for the most part retains that status even today (""Gigli"" not withstanding). James Caan is brilliant as Sonny, who meets a gruesome end (one of cinema's best deaths) at a toll both. Future Woody Allen cohort Diane Keaton shimes as Kaye Adams, Michael's much put upon girlfriend who loves him yet cannot put up with his violent lifestyle. Robert Duvall plays the adpated Corleone brother, Thomas Hagen, and plays the role to a tee. Talia Shire, though forever remembered as Adrienne from the ""Rocky"" series, is perfect for Connie, the lone Corleone sister. And the actor who plays Fredo (unfortunately, I forgot his name, John something, I think) is really good and unfortunately passed away at a young age.

This is truly an example of a cinematic masterpiece. If you do not own this dvd, you must get it. Otherwise, your dvd collection will be empty without it.",1118880000,2,2312,4.8040201005025125
1181252,5,B000003KHS,"Since the 1972 release of ""The Godfather"", it has been hailed by many critics as one of the top ten greatest films ever made.  This film proved to be only the beginning in this triumphant history making.  It received ten Oscar nominations, winning only three (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor [Marlon Brando refused]).  It's proceeded with two sequels that either match or beat the quality of the original.  While most film sequels don't match even closely to its original, this trilogy has stood against the test of time.  This film has since influenced many filmmakers that have since come.

""The Godfather"" follows the lives of the Corleone family, one who commits organized crime.  Vito Corleone, the family leader, is slowly losing his health due to old age.  His struggle to create peace within the rival families is growing harder because of major recent conflicts.  People are continually get murdered.  The Corleone family must protect and love one another more urgently to assure the safety.  Meanwhile, this follows the rising power of Michael Corleone, who becomes better known through the remaining trilogy.  The eyeopening series of events ready audiences for the triumphant sequel.

Director and writer Francis Ford Coppola leads the cast and crew to create this amazing masterpiece.  He pays great homage to the novel of the same name written by Mario Puzo, who assisted in writing this screenplay.  The maintained emotional stance allows room to explore themes beyond organized crime.  Themes of family, love, protection, and italian pride fit wonderfully within the film.  Amazingly, this film doesn't portray the Corleone family as either good or evil.  Despite the crimes committed by them, the powerful stance never loses its edge.  Throughout, the film's passion that keeps audiences watching remains intact.

The physical backgrounds give accurate and great additions to this film.  Through the buildings to the wardrobes, it feels like actual 1940's living.  The research proves revalent with its obvious hard work.  Its level of greatness presents itself as more than elaborate backgrounds.  Audiences can sense the individual themes through these physical beings, namely italian pride and organized crime.  The use of color and their tones matches well with the film.

Everytime the music is heard, one thought arises to the listeners: ""The Godfather"".  The type of music is always played in the perfect scenes to match with the events.  Two versions of the main theme are presented: the orchestral and the italian-based.  It begins with a long trumpet solo, no instruments backing it.  Then it changes to the chorus played by the woodwinds.  Afterwards, it plays various melodies with various instruments.  Then the chorus repeats itself but more intensely and with string instruments.  The other songs also present themselves wonderfully, though not as well-known.

""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and John Cazale.  This amazing cast makes this film them much more powerful.  Audiences could not possible ask for better.  Pacino, Caan, and Duvall also received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor.  This is one of few times in Oscar history that three actors from the same film are nominated for the same catagory.  None are more deserving than these three with their fine performances.  Brando states his performance the heaviest by developing an old-man italian accent for his role as Vito Corleone.  His expressions match well with Vito's personality and his health/ emotions.

Such tremendous film quality makes ""The Godfather"" deserving of its title as a classic.  This is sure to please many audiences for many more years.  Those who like this film should also watch the two sequels.  Those interested in them must watch this edition first.  Otherwise, the events will be confusing.",1118188800,,3915,5.262135922330097
1181253,5,B000003KHS,"I don't think anybody will fight me on the fact that Marlon Brando's character ""Vito Corleone"" is probably the coolest and most slick guy in the movie history.

Everything about this film is perfect. The slighly romantic mood to the film to capture that charming Italian style. The patriarical figure Brando plays over his sons, by leading them into a life of crime which seems like the right thing to do in his case. Except for Pacino's character ""Michael Corleone"" who in the first scene at Connie's wedding is reluctunt to join the family business.

The great thing about this film is that it dosn't drag the Italian-Americans through the dirt. (Like say, 'Goodfellas' or 'The Sopranos') The word 'Mafia' or 'La Cosa Nostra' is never mentioned in this film. There is no edvidence to say that these people are in the Mafia per say. Except the whole 'Family' look upon things, but then aren't all Italians close to their 'a La Famille'

This reflects the issue...is the Godfather a Mafia Movie or are the just Italian who happen to be Criminals?For the obvious reason I am going to say they are Mafia Family, but when this view was struck upon me , it did make me think...

That movie has all the violence swearing and drug use you could expect in a crime movie, except it has rich charaterizations, a hilarious Joe Pesci,a great storyline that will hold your attention to the very last frame, and an awesome 60's and 70's soundtrack that won't bore you to death like the music in the Godfather......This is a boring movie, please go rent Goodfellas",1115337600,14,921,4.536144578313253
1181256,5,B000003KHS,"In my opinion this is one of those rare films that can quite literally be considered to be absolutely perfect.  Marlon Brando will always be The Godfather, in one of the great performances in movie history.  Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and of course Al Pacino as Michael Corleone all are perfectly cast, and all turn in simply perfect performances.  The supporting cast is equally good.  In my opinion there simply is nothing about this film not to like.  The Godfather was one of the great American novels of the 20th Century, and this film absolutely does it justice and brings to the screen a great piece of Americana concerning the immigrant experience in 20th Century America.

In particular, the wistful sub-plot of Michael in exile in Sicily is hauntingly and beautifully done.  This is one of those films in which the musical score adds a great deal to the viewing experience, and in particular the theme music for the Sicily scenes is classic and unforgettable.

One of the strengths of the story, both in film and novel, is that although the characters with whom the viewer identifies are gangsters, in no way does this film glorify the mafia or organized crime, which instead are portrayed as ultimately self-destructive institutions, particularly in the fine sequel to this film: Godfather II (which is every bit as good as The Godfather, albeit missing Brando's magnificent presence).

This is the kind of film that comes along only once or twice in a generation (if we are lucky), and every film afficianado will want this DVD in his or her collection.  This is one that most of us will watch many, many times over the years.",1114214400,4,1669,4.7839721254355405
1181257,5,B000003KHS,"Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Godfather was nominated for an additional eight. The brainchild of celebrated author Mario Puzo, the film is considered the crowning achievement of Francis Ford Coppola's directing career. Providing audiences with a glimpse into the notorious underworld of warring New York crime families, The Godfather catapulted a number of actors into fame's limelight, among them - James Caan, Al Pacino, and Robert Duvall (all three nominated for Best Supporting Actor). In addition, Marlon Brando turns in, arguably, the most memorable performance of his career. Certainly among the top five films of all time, the case could be made that The Godfather is the most perfect movie ever produced...

The film opens as ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) hosts his daughter's wedding, entertaining friends and business associates. Vito's favorite son Michael (Al Pacino) has come home from the war, and he's determined to do something different with his life other than joining the family business. Idealistic at heart, the young Michael inspires his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) with tales of the fine and outstanding things he will do with his life. Through the eyes of Michael, the audience learns of the family's various business methods and the hierarchy of its system. Vito's eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is the heir apparent to his father's empire. Middle son Fredo (John Cazale) performs his part in the business, but few consider him a possible successor. Providing legal council to the family is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), a long-time friend of the family who Michael treats as a brother.

Things are well for the Corleone family until Vito is approached by opportunistic newcomer Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) wishing to sell drugs on the street. He asks for the Don's blessing so he can expand his operations. But Vito sees a big difference between gambling and prostitution and drug running on school playgrounds and family neighborhoods. The Don's preference for placing family above all else conflicts with the changing times.

When competing crime families are more accommodating to Sollozzo's business proposal, the enterprise sparks a bloody war between the crime families which quickly leads to the murder of Sonny Corleone. Vito attempts to end the conflict in its early stages, but an attempt is made on his life as well.

Avenging his brother's death, Michael carries out a hit on two men in an Italian restaurant. Afterward, he hides out for several months in Sicily where he marries a beautiful village girl. But she dies from a car bomb shortly thereafter - a car bomb intended for Michael.

With the battle for crime syndicate supremacy in full swing, Michael is forced to fill the vacuum created by his brother Sonny's death. As his father reaches the end of his life, Michael is groomed as his replacement. When Vito finally dies of a heart attack, Michael lets his presence be known in direct fashion. All enemies of the Corleone family are eliminated in a single bloody hour. And with Kay as his new wife, Michael follows in his father's footsteps as the latest incarnation of Don Corleone...

A dramatic story of family and change, of the idealism of youth and the pragmatism of adulthood, The Godfather stands alone as the greatest mafia film ever produced - and perhaps as the best drama in history. Al Pacino's masterful performance would soon be replicated in The Godfather II and countless other films in the decades since, cementing his place among Hollywood legends. Widely heralded as one of the best written and best directed films in history, The Godfather is a must-see film for any serious cinema aficionado...

The Godfather II was also remarkable, providing the incredible backstory for Vito as a child and how he came to be.  It reveals the details of his past that most were anxious to discover after viewing Godfather I.  As such, the slower pacing and darker qualities of the second film were not a liability. This epic version was edited chronologically, which means you actually see mostly Godfather II for the first third of the epic.  For some first-time viewers this version may not work as well.

I actually own the DVD box collection with films 1,2 and 3.  When I'm in the mood to watch The Godfather I & II films however, I always find myself pulling out this version on VHS instead. I much prefer watching this family's story unfold over time.

Seriously, how great is The Godfather??? It's totally great. I can't even begin to guess how many times I've seen it over the years.

The story grabs you right from the beginning and doesn't let go of you, not even after it's over. As for the acting in this - simply awesome! Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Keaton - all of them are incredible in this.

You'll often hear people say ""you've gotta see it!"" about a movie. A lot of times it's just not true. In The Godfather's case, you really DO have to see it if you haven't see it.

1181264,5,B000003KHS,"After reading several reviews of this film and its sequel, I have come to the conclusion that film is misunderstood.  The Godfather isn't just another crime film or another mafia film, it is a story of power, family, and capitalism.  The crime is merely an illustration of the power.

  The Godfather deals with power on many levels.  In the first Godfather, we see the influence of power- for example the Horse head scene or the assasination of Moe Greene- and more importantly how through miscalculations and poor tactical decisions, this power is nearly lost.  For example, Sonny's decision to have Michael murder Solozzo and McCluskey proves to be a grave error, as a full-scaled war ensues between the Corleone family and the other five families which results in a considerable weakening of the family's strength.  I can't speak on the aquisition of power yet, because that requires a proper reading of the book or alternatively, a viewing of the second film.

  Why, you may ask, is power such a central theme in the movie?  The Godfather hints that organized crime is yet another form of American business-thatis, capitalism.  After all, why is Vito Corleone gunned down in the street near the beginning?  Not simply because he refused Solozzo, but because he refused to exert his political influence to help Solozzo's business. The Godfather part 2 deals with this on a more profound level,  giving the viewer an exact idea of political corruption(remember Senator Geary?).

  But the Godfather is also representative of another phenomenon which came to fruition in America in the 70's:  A loss of innocence and corruption.  Michael Corleone's character is a full embodiment of these feelings, and wee see in the second film how business robs him of his youth, his trust, and makes him a cynical and lonely man.

  Films like Goodfellas and Casino can't hold a candle to this film.  In those films, the main characters are portrayed as lunatics and have none of the charm of subtlety of a character like Don Corleone.  Before I leave, I might suggest reading the book and paying close attention to the Godfather part 2 to grasp these ideas properly.",1104278400,3,2157,4.908587257617729
1181265,2,B000003KHS,"When I first saw this movie, I had been built up to believe that this movie was (and is) one of the best films ever made.  My parents, friends, and English teacher, for we studied this film in class, all thought so.  However, I beg to differ.

 This film may have been new for it's time and left some kind of mark; however, I just can't see this film having any kind of permanence at all.

First of all, the cinematography isn't that impressive.  For instance, there are only about three camera shots, three, that stand out as nice, but for the rest of the movie everything is just bland (camera stuff that is).  Lighting?  Well, it's dark.  That's it, just dark.  How complicated is that, making a film dark?  Now film technicalities out of the way, let's talk about story.

 This movie is not an American success story, as some people would like you to think.  Think of it this way.  When an ethnic group creates an underground crime organization we laud it in films and books, but when real gangs break out they are feared on Channel 5 news.  Double standard, right?  So, as the supposedly sweet Godfather goes off killing or threatening people remember he's doing just that, and I even liked Marlon Brando's part (the Godfather!)

 Once the film becomes Michael's story, one of the Godfather's sons (played by Pacino), that's when I really phase out.  This is a story, and the sequel too, about Michael's conflict.  However, I think that Coppola actually believes that we are supposed to feel for this cold-hearted person, who was supposed to be the good son.

 If you want to watch a film that is drawn out, boring, and shows why ""business"" is all it is then go ahead.  Also, I feel you should watch it just because everyone else thinks it is so ""important""; maybe you'll agree.  However, I personally feel it just was not a good film by any standards.",1103846400,11,1857,4.521084337349397
1181266,5,B000003KHS,"I think it is fair to say that ""The Godfather"" is among the most acclaimed films of all time.  This movie is huge - an icon - and many since have imitated it's style.  For decades I don't know how many movies have been hyped as ""The Chinese Godfather"" or ""The Modern Godfather"".  They all fall short of the original.

It's interesting to me that much second-guessing surrounded everything from the story to the casting of actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Those two are joined by Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire and I see I'm using up space giving you the all-star cast.

The story, the direction, the lighting and the cinematography were all revolutionary.  It was controversial to make a movie in which the ""heroes"" were gangsters, but here Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo mesmerized us with the story of men who were at times ruthless killers, yet at the same time devoted to their families and devout to their church.  The backstory of how Vito Corleone became ""The Godfather"" from Puzo's original novel isn't told until the 2nd movie (with Robert DeNiro playing the young Vito), but we see that these Mafia men believe that they are in a country full of opportunity, but also full of corruption - they know that if they don't exploit the world someone else will - so this justfies their careers in their minds.

The movie is a series of virtuoso sequences and performances.  Small nuances are performed with fluorishes - Brando affectionately petting the purring kitten in the opening sequence while men are lining up to come into his office to pay their respects or ask favors of him - because it's his daughter's wedding day he cannot refuse.

The wedding introduces the broad cast of characters and we get time to see that Santino is the hot-headed lover, Fredo is the dim-witted brother and Michael is the returning war-hero who distances himself from the ""family business"".  Although there are literally hundreds of individual sub-plots, the main story of the entire Godfather Trilogy is Michael's, (after his father) and how he goes from youngest son, determined to stay out of the business, to a Godfather more ruthless than them all.

After the wedding is another virtuoso scene that sets up most of the rest of the movie.  Al Lettieri as Sollozzo requests a meeting with the Corleone family.  He wants to establish a drug empire and he has already made arrangements for getting the opium and distributing it.  From the Corleones he needs ""a little finance"" and political protection for when his men are inevitably stopped by police.  Vito Corleone has made his fortune first hijacking delivery trucks, then in gambling and bootlegging, which he tells Sollozzo the police regard as ""harmless vices"".  He is disdainful of a rival Don who deals in prostitution. At one point he tells his son ""Tattaglia is a pimp"" with complete disgust.  He tells Sollozzo that he must refuse the offer because his political friends will no longer be his friends if he begins to deal in drugs.  Sollozzo replies that the Tattaglia family guarantee the investment, and that the riches are projected to come pouring in.  Hot-headed Sonny speaks out of turn and abruptly interjects ""you mean the Tattaglia's GUARANTEE our investment"".  His father has already decided for his entire organization, and Santino, the 2nd in charge, reveals his eagerness to Sollozzo for trying this drug plan.  No word is spoken after Vito shuts up his son with a gesture, but knowing looks are passed between everyone in the room.  There will be trouble because Sollozzo now knows that Sonny is hot for the deal.

Sollozzo arranges to hit Don Corleone and his most trusted bodyguard, the fearful Luca Brasi.  What he doesn't plan on is that Sonny's loyalty to his family, and his famous rage, are going to take precedent over any desire to join Sollozzo in the drug business.

I have only encapsulated the first act of one of America's greatest film epics.  Although they are gangsters, these characters stick with you.  For many of them, there is ""honor among thieves"", and at one point a long-time trusted Capo is led to betray the family and you really feel sorrow for him as he is led away and states remorsefully ""Tell Mike it was only business.""

The business of this movie sucks you up into Mario Puzo's world and you hardly feel as if time has passed when the credits roll almost three hours later.  This is the King of the Gangster movies.",1102982400,3,4477,4.760362694300518
1181267,4,B000003KHS,"The Godfather, 1972 film

This film starts on a wedding day, and introduces the characters. One scene shows an offended father asking for justice (or revenge) on the two men who beat up his daughter. Another example of the influence of the rich and famous over civil courts? But the girl's father seeks an older system of justice, and succeeds. This would be known as the unwritten law. Later we see how negotiations can influence movie production. Its who you know, not what you know (as on Wall Street). Changing conditions presents Don Corleone with a chance to enter a more lucrative business. But he refuses, since this business could damage his relationship with important politicians. [Could this be true given the events over the past fifty years?] This results in an attempt to give Don Corleone an early retirement. (We later find out who was the traitor.)

The incident at the hospital, when Michael finds it deserted, shows powerful forces at work. Michael acts quickly to safeguard his father. (And we find another crook.) Michael devises a strategy to eliminate business problems; it works. Michael's coolness contrasts to Sonny's emotions. Then Michael takes a long vacation afterwards. Sonny is lured into a trap, and killed in a spectacular manner. But this results in an end to the warfare. Don Corleone agrees to let the others draw water from the well (use his political influence to allow drug dealing). [And what does that tell you about out Establishment? But this is only a work of fiction, not journalism.]

After the death of Don Corleone, Michael plans a take-over move to reduce or eliminate his business competitors. This will take place after his nephew is baptized. [Dramatic effect? Waiting could let opportunities slip away.] Old scores are settled with the liquidation of Michael's rivals. But some cleaning up has to be done close to home. The film ends with the Corleone family moving west to the unspoiled lands of Las Vegas (the California trade). Will that bring them more happiness?

Most films are condensed versions of the book. You may want to read the 1968 novel for background, and to better judge the filmed version. Events are simplified and telescoped to fit within the constraints of time and budget. There is no mention of the political and economic conflicts of those days. It is not a coincidence for organized crime to flourish in the financial capitals like New York, Chicago, Boston, etc. Its as if Big Corporations need people to do the things that lawyers can't legally accomplish.",1102377600,3,2538,4.936768149882904
1181268,5,B000003KHS,"The Godfather is--without a doubt--the best movie I have ever seen.  Never has a movie had such an impact on me. From that first memorable line (""I believe in America"") to the final shot with that brilliant look of sudden understanding on Diane Keaton's face I was completely enthralled.

What the editorial review says at the top of the page puts it perfectly: ""...this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end...""

That is very true. The cinematography is crisp and clean, even more so now that it has been released in the DVD format. The lengths that Coppola went to in order to make this 70's film look like it took place in the 40's are truly admirable. This is made even more apparent by the little details that Coppola points out in the commentary.

The film is absolutley brimming with memorable scenes. I could even go as far as to say that every scene is a memorable scene. The diner scene of course, the ambush at the railroad tracks, the murder of the traitorous bodyguard within view of the Statue of Liberty, the horse head in Tom Woltz's bed, tricking the assassins at the hospital, Vito Corleone passing away while playing with his grandson in the tomato garden (brilliant!), etc.

By far the strongest part of the Godfather is in the acting, the highlight of course being on Marlon Brando's superb performance as Vito Corleone. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall also give excellent performances. Not one of the roles were miscast.

1181270,5,B000003KHS,"This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.

I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.

I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.

Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the ""message"" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.

But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.

Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.

This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live. From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.

Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.

Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.",1101168000,43,4615,4.395784543325527
1181271,2,B000003KHS,"A while back I read that ""The Godfather"" was the favorite book of a certain author I enjoy.  I eagerly picked up the book, and was quickly fascinated with the plight of the Corleone family, and those who surrounded them.  I also noted that virtually all of the reviews of the book agreed that the movie was better...I apparently disagree with the entire world.

To be honest I felt this movie shamed Puzo's work.  Sub-plots either dissapear completely (as with Santino's girlfriend and the doctor), or are incomplete (as with Johnny, and the daughter).  Lines which once held significance are reduced to nothing, not even an explanation of their original significance (in the book all the other Dons laughed at the idea of heroine being sold to kids, and the Don's speech about what he'd do if anything happened to Micheal was much longer).  I give it 2 stars because most of the actors do their jobs competently, although not extrodinarily.  But by some freak accident of nature the one actor who was truly ill-equiped for his role recieved an Oscar for it.  That's right Mr. Brando, I'm talking to you.  Do not EVER try to play a mofioso again.

Today I sat down to a 3-hour viewing.  Wow - it was a long movie.  And I didn't know that it dated from 1972 (at least I have an excuse for not watching it!).  It was long because some scenes dragged on much longer than I had expected.

Nevertheless, the movie aged really well.  It was hard for me to place the movie in the 70's - the production was simply first rate.  Al Pacino and Marlon Brando provided sterling performances .  Now, I finally understand all the spoofs about the raspy voice and the little-fingered-moustache-scratch.  And the horse-head scene was unforgettable.

It brought me back to the age when movies did not drag the audience by the sheer force of special effects and gratuitious violence.  This movie had to rely on a carefully produced scenes and the subtle events to hold the viewer's attention.  Its like reading a classic book  and rediscovering a masterpiece.

1181274,5,B000003KHS,"When one looks over the movies that are usually mentioned as the all-time greats, there is usually some innovation, technical achievement, artistic statement, or heart-warming impression that explains the choice.  I'm not sure that ""The Godfather"" fits any of those categories but it certainly has to be considered as one of the greatest movies of all-time.  Francis Ford Coppola took an excellent engrossing, suspenseful book and turned it into a movie with the same qualities.  From the opening to the closing scene, everything about this movie was carefully planned, designed, and orchestrated.  It is a masterpiece of cinematic craftmanship.

The acting is superb with Brando taking the prize in his portrayal of Don Corleone, the Godfather.  His raspy voice that suggested reason while disguising intrigue was one of the many keys to the effective tone of the movie.  There were scenes of violence, to be sure.  However, it was the quiet, calculated moves that created a greater sense of evil.  It was the implication of quiet yet ruthless planning that made the horse's head all the scarier.  Sonny (played very well by James Cann) did not understand the subtleties of evil whereas Michael (played even better by Al Pacino) did.

The music was haunting, the costume were well-done, the cinematography was excellent, the writing outstanding but it was the directing that carries the movie.  I'm not sure whatever happened to Francis Ford Coppola.  I realize that he had other achievements, not the least of which was the sequel of ""Godfather II"".  However, this man displayed a talent seldom seen.  Maybe it was just the right mind and vision for the right project but it sure seemed that we would be seeing a lot more from this man.

Everybody has at least one scene from ""The Godfather"" that has stayed with them more than others.  For many it is the horse's head, for others it's ""the offer he can't refuse"", while for others it may be something as subtle as the slowly closing door at the end of the movie.  Each of those images appeals to us on a different level.  ""The Godfather"" has worked its' way into our culture and why not?  It is a movie that appeals to most every movie goer from age 14 on up.

1181275,5,B000003KHS,"This is the greatest American film of all time.  It may not have been the slickest piece of film-making or broke any new ground but it's themes, the importance of family, both biological and professional, resonate to this day.  In this case the families happen to be both Italian-American and Mafia, but that's just incidental.  I've never read the novel that this is based on but it's my understanding that Mario Puzo's book is pulpier than than the film that Francis Ford Coppola made of it.  That is one of the reasons that this film is elevated above all others in that it could have been soapier and glitzier than it was but it did not succumb to that and credit has to be given to Coppola as both screenwriter and director for that.  Coppola emphasized in his script it's most important theme, family, and concentrated on developing characters instead of stereotypes.  Yes, some people remember the more violent and sensational aspects of this film.  We also know the people in this film.  The Corleone's are as familiar to us as either are own family or neighbors.  Marlon Brando gives an appropriately subdued performance here as Don Vito Corleone.  His character seems melancholic and rueful, seeming to be mourning his situation in life or the changing ways of his chosen way of life, yet accepts the reality and the responsibilities that come for a man in his position.  Al Pacino in his second film, his first being the little seen ""Panic in Needle Park"", is dynamic as Michael, the son that the Don wanted better things for but because of changing circumstance is drawn into the family business.  Michael is to prove that he is more than up to the challenge of settling scores.  James Caan as Sonny, the heir apparent to the Don who may be a little to emotional and hot-headed for the job, does tremendous work here.  Robert Duvall is also good in the role of Tom Hagen, adopted son of the Corleones, who acts as lawyer for the family's business.  It also should be noted that John Cazale appears here as Fredo, the ineffectual Corleone son.  Fredo's character isn't really developed until the second installment of this saga but I would like to note that Cazale, who died young in 1978 but made the most of his short life.  Besides appearing in the first two ""Godfather"" films he also appeared and was quite effective in ""The Conversation"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", and ""The Deer Hunter"", released after his death.  There are may other great actors (Talia Shire, Richard Castellano, etc.) so numerous who do good work here.  Some would feel that ""The Godfather"" is a romanticized depiction of the Mafia but I don't see that as the case.  ""The Godfather"" is a good story whose milieu is incidentally in the world of organized crime.

Every element of this film is perfect.  I've seen it and its sequels more than a dozen times and am always caught up in this fascinating epic.

Simply put, loyalty to the family is seemingly all that matters.  Then why, when Michael finally decides to involve himself inextricably in the affairs of the family out of concern for his father, does he become such a cold and feared figure instead of revered, beloved, and respected like his father?

1181280,5,B000003KHS,"""One of the Best Films of the Decade.""

The ""Godfather"" is Frances Ford Coppola's best film. Marlon Brando gives the most memorable performance in film history as Vito Corleone. The Movie is based on the gripping and compulsive book, The Godfather. Al Pacino gives a legendary performances as Michael Corleone.

The beginning is set late in the summer of 1945. The films roots, however, are set in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is about rival gangs murdering each other, and now we see the inbred corrupt system of loyalty and terror, in which killing is a preferred way of dealing with the competition. We see how the gangs encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see their subculture, based on a split between the men's conception of their responsibilities, which they keep dark form there families, and the false world the create to shelter the women and children.

The visual scheme is based on the most obvious life and death contrasts, the men meet and conduct their business in deep toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, world and the sunshine that they share with the woman and children. The tension is in the meetings held in the underworld darkness and one gets the feeling that this secret life has its own poetry of fear. The dark and light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. Noting the Catholic background of the characters and the eternal battle of good and evil, of innocence versus knowledge, knowledge in this instance equates with shame nd guilt.

BRANDO

The enormous cast is lead by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the ""Godfather"" of a powerful Sicilian - American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Micheal. Is Brando marvelous? Yes, he is, but then he often is, he was marvelous a few years ago in ""On The Waterfront."" He's shockingly effective in a current film, the ""Score."" The role of Don Corleone, a patriarch in his early sixties, allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull, but Brando manages to humanize him. Brando internalizes Don Vito's power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.

THE CAST

However, Brando isn't the whole show; James Caan is very fine actor , and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don sons suggest different aspects of Brando, Caan's Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando, while his heir, Michael, and Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Like Brando in this film, Pacino is simple, you don't catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn't stess the father and son links, they are simply there for us to notice when we will. In the end of the ""Godfather"" nothing is resolved, because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn't clean up the docks at the end of ""On The Waterfront"", that was a lie. The ""Godfather"" is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.",1093737600,3,3387,4.799313893653516

A film rich in various themes about family, society, immigrants, and the American dream; brought to life by the brilliant directing skills of Coppola and an all-star cast.

Al Pacino is becoming a man and is approached by his father Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) with an offer he can't refuse: an offer for him to be the new Don in charge of the family business.

 The movie opens with Don Vito Corleone's daughter getting married in the post-war period but Vito himself has been keeping himself inside his home. His organized criminal empire is based on gambling, prostitution, and liquor sales but when another mob leader named Sollozo makes a deal to sell narcotics, Vito refuses because of his devotion to the family code of honor.

Sollozo, feeling angered at Vito's refusal orders his assassination but after Vito is severely wounded in a failed murder attempt, his son Michael, who wants nothing to do with the crime is forced into the underworld to protect his father. A vicious cycle of murders happens again and again as mobsters enact revenge against each other.

 This movie is just amazing and is a dark and dramatic insight into the damage that organized crime has on the innocent civilians as well as the gang members themselves. One scene was where Michael after killing McClusky and Sollozo flees to Sicily and marries an Italian women only for her to be killed in a roadside bomb planted by hitmen who tracked him down to Sicily.

1181286,5,B000003KHS,"Television takes a pretty bad rap. It is often derided for its stultifying properties, engendering of abject values and overall ability to vitiate the masses. Many even claim that it foments a sundering influence over families. I suppose there is some merit to such an assertion, but I can tell you that when I was growing up the TV was the node in which our otherwise fragmented family coalesced. I guess we would be referred to as `dysfunctional' today; my father didn't talk to us much and the dinner table was a surface in which to set the groceries until they were put away. If my parents did ask about how school went, a laconic `alright' would satisfy. But when we sat in front of that glowing cynosure, with its exogenous felicity and fruition, our reticence faded into commentary. Somehow the factitious world contained in that electronic box inspired us to notice each other. We watched and we talked.

So when it was deemed that I was mature enough to watch the network premier of `The Godfather' I was not only anticipating a good movie, I was looking forward to family bonding. I positively loved to listen to my father and older brothers (I'm the baby) engage in dialogue and repartee in response to the TV. Their insight brought more to light than my young mind could comprehend with just the presentation as is, and I felt edified as well as inclusive. Hey some folks have the visits to Yellowstone, I have this.

Even though it was too much for an adolescent to fully appreciate, I knew then that this movie was something special. And as I grew older I watched it every time it aired. Of course after videos arrived this was the first movie I purchased. It is the crme de le crme of films, of which I have watched at least 50 times. It is a work of art that I can call a masterpiece without a bit of hyperbole. It is my opinion the greatest picture ever made.

Though a substantial portion of the film takes place in Sicily, and many customs of that land (as well as cabala) are featured this is a very American story. It is no less than a stunning examination of the dichotomy that is success in the land of opportunity. It is a tale of the fine line between legitimacy and profligacy in the capitalist world, of the gray area that exists between transgression and ignominy. And if the film is a treatise on the American way then the opening line, `I believe in America', is its exordium. With those prefatory words Coppola sets the tone.

What follows is a congeries of dexterous camera shots, first-rate dialogue, incredible acting, untiring character development and one hell of a story. The juxtaposition of criminality and family honor/personal loyalty is achieved with utmost precision. The motif of personal rectitude vis--vis societal ethos pervades the film. The main characters embody this paradox. They are vicious yet decorous, violent yet urbane, heartless yet not without code.

The actors are at their best. Brando providing gravitas, Cann relishing his bellicose role, Keaton appearing to live her enduring conflict. It is Pacino of course who must steer the course, as his permutation is unveiled before us. Pacino achieves this vicissitude with a subtlety that resembles an insidious whisper, inaudible to those who underestimate him.

If you will allow me an indulgence I would like to comment on the outstanding ending to this work. At times movies are often beloved for memorable scenes. The finale of this tale is as piquant as they come. Coppola understands the power of the doorway, and the shot of Kay's face, overcome with the realization of her husband's duplicity, as the door closes, symbolically shutting her out of his life, is sheer pathos. Did I mention that I love this ending? In fact the par excellence of this conclusion has soured me on the sequels. I have watched them and think they are great, but I do not possess them and never will. Any extension of this saga is a reproach to this superb terminus ad quem.

`The Godfather' is a film that must be watched numerous times to absorb and appreciate the many names, nuances, and instances. I highly recommend it.",1091577600,,4118,4.711111111111111

1181290,4,B000003KHS,"The Godfather defines the mafia gangster genre, and I finally got around to watching it after all these years.  I had to watch the three hour long movie over a week period, so I missed out on the effect of watching it in one sitting.
The extended opening scene of the wedding sets the tone for the entire movie, showing Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, the all powerful Godfather who grants priveledges and life and death to all that come before him.  We also meet the advisor Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Sonny Coreone (James Caan) and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.)
Michael utters the line, ""I'm not like my father.""  Then the rest of the movie shows Michael's slow transformation into a man exactly like his father.  The movie shows the reasons why Michael would change, but don't actually show him changing.  Michael just gradually takes control of the business.  The scenes in Italy with his wife were especially touching.  Her death probably shaped him more than anything, and made him realize he would never be safe unless he went on the offensive.
My problem with the movie is how it sped through time, covering years at a time.  In one scene, Michael asks Diane Keaton to marry him.  The next scene they are both in, Michael has couple of kids.

1181291,5,B000003KHS,"Excellent film, although the violence is disturbing.
A few little things in the film are notable for me in
clarifying the contradictory personalities of the characters.
(1)  In the scene where Sonny smashes the camera of the
man photographing the vehicles parked at his sister's
wedding, he throws down a couple of bills to the photographer
as he is walking away.  Sonny may be violent, but he
isn't a thief!
(2)  In the scene at the beginning where singer Johnny
Fontaine is complaining about his problems to Vito
Corleone, Corleone tells Johnny that he is too thin
and should eat more.  It is touching how this mafia
don who has people ""rubbed out"" is concerned about
the health of his friend like a Jewish mother.
(3)  When Clemenza kills his co-worker Pauley, he
tells the fellow who actually did the shooting
to ""leave the gun and take the cannoli"" which he
promised to bring to his wife as he was leaving
for ""work"" that day.  A concientious husband! (and
killer)
(4)  Michael, at the end of the film, chews his wife
out for asking about his ""personal business"". Finally,
he gives in and tells her....a lie, that he didn't
rub out Carlo, his brother-in-law.  Didn't he think
she knew what was really going on?  And why does
she keep playing along with the lie? Everyone is
really lying to themselves and continuing with the
charade.
(5) When the heads of the ""five families"" get together
to regulate the narcotics trade, they agree that it
shouldn't be sold near schools.  That, presumably,
wouldn't be moral or ethical, but selling it elsewhere
would be ? (or is it they are being pragmatic and think
that the authorities won't
crack down on them if they sell somewhere else).",1089072000,2,1683,4.6745762711864405

There are many worthy issues to remark. The first of them was the superb approach and conception given to this complex and even fascinating world of the mob.
Until this movie; no other one had made such analytical surgeon, with so deep gaze. The camera (with a photography which reminds us to Visconti in several dramatic sequences) establishes as another actor.
The amazing cast was another cosmical achievement. Coppola has always had that hunter smell for the outstanding actors.
What can we add to the unforgettable performance of Marlon Brando? . More than acting Brando established a landmark; he became in a model for this role.
But the emerging talents such as Robert de Niro , James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and the young raising promise as Al Pacino who had revealed the year before with Serpico, looks like they had established a unspoken commitment, not only with the directorial code, but with themselves.
The flow of the story follows the same model as a Symphony in four movements. Coppola will never be effectist with the action sequences; he makes that you feel as logical and the use of the music looks like a voice in off, which makes as a natural link for the work in progress.
There are, at least five unforgettable sequences in this legend movie. This work from its release, became in a reference film.

The movie tells the story of the Corleone family, one of the Five Families in New York City.  Headed by Don Vito Corleone, the family must survive in the changing times after World War II as the drug industry begins to spread in America.  The Godfather must try and hold his family and empire together against the other mafia families, but also against his own family.  This movie has become an important part of American pop culture for good reason.  The movie is full of great characters, fantastic one-liners, the instantly recognizable theme, and the  still alarming violence.  This is a great movie that should not be missed by movie fans everywhere.
  Marlon Brando fully deserved his Academy Award for his performance as Vito Corleone, the head of the powerful Corleone family in NYC.  This was also the movie to skyrocket Al Pacino to the top as Michael Corleone who takes charge of the family when everything begins to go wrong.  The impressive cast includes James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop, Captain McCluskey.  The movie also stars John Marley, Abe Vigoda, Al Lettieri, Talia Shire, and Richard Conte.  The DVD offers a great-looking widescreen presentation and commentary from director Francis Ford Coppola.

There is no weak point in this film, the acting by all concerned, writing, the camera work, and of course the man who put it all together Mr. Coppola, did a superb job. This film is the most honest and realistic portrait of life. I can't think of any movie that is more believable. Scarface is compared but doesn't even come close and in my opinion isn't a good film.

1181305,5,B000003KHS,"I stumbled across this classic on cable TV a few evenings ago and that was it:  I abandoned all other plans for the evening and watched the movie.  Then I retrieved Mario Puzo's novel from my book collection and plowed through it, savoring and relishing this extraordinary piece of literature that had such an impact on our cultural landscape thirty-plus years ago.
Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER is a triumphant, magnificent screen portrayal of Puzo's epic book.  The story of an Italian-American mob ""family"" entrenched in inherent and often desperate violence, Coppola weaves this film with compelling, moving, and haunting visuals that are as beautiful as they are disturbing.  The scenes are at once simplistic and complex, yet such a dichotomy is not lost on the viewer, but embraced--appreciated for its overwhelming genius.
I've seen more than my fair share of Marlon Brando films, and in my opinion the character of Don Vito Corleone is this actor's signature role.  Brando effectively portrays the Godfather's compassion, love and devotion to his family, and calm acumen to make ""business"" decisions that literally mean life or death to countless men.  Don Vito is both a family man and a killer:  two seemingly inconsistent characteristics that make Brando's portrayal even more remarkable.  The rest of the cast, including James Caan and Robert Duvall, is exceptional, but it is Al Pacino as young Michael Corleone--Don Vito's ""baby boy"" who was not meant to enter the family business--who provides the most telling role in this film.  Before our very eyes, we see Michael change from a man eager to remain at arms-length to the Corleone family ventures to a ruthless, cold-blooded Godfather himself--a transformation both astounding and eery.
THE GODFATHER is a feast of unforgettable cinematic moments:  from an ambush at a toll booth to a bloody horse head wrapped in satin sheets.  Puzo's story is told--told through filmmaking as good as it gets.

1181306,5,B000003KHS,"The Godfather has ensnared generations of moviegoers with its indefinable and spellbinding mystique. Every decade a new generation wonders what all the hullabaloo is about, as it hears tales from its preceding one told with the awe reserved for having witnessed a real-life experience, and seeks to explore, simply out of curiosity. And emerges from that 3-hour experience with the same wistful look in its eye. Of having felt - ""This is a different world I've entered, cut-off from the one I left outside the theatre. It works according to its own laws. I'm not sure I want to leave, but I'll always carry it with me."" And thus, we go back, again, and again, and again, to see this film supposedly about mafias and gangs and their rulers and their mighty tiffs. We are ready to see men being strangulated in the back seat of cars, bullets battering a body on a lone highway, a girl being blown up, a blood-stained bath-tub, and the beheaded horse, if only we could get to see one more torturous time, Michael sitting alone on a bench, when all is over in Part 2, staring into the distance. And then to see the credits roll, and hear Nino Rota's mournful score, one more time. Yes this is a world of sordid crime, but to us it is a haven of respite. Yes its protagonist is the warlord of the underworld, but we find his story more bewitching than that of many heroes. Yes do speak softly love, for this is a timeless romance.

  What is it about the Godfather that reduces, critics and viewers alike, to mawkish rhapsodies? I think we owe this experience to the staggering technical achievements of this film. We see the Godfather as visual, sonic, dramatic, and musical poetry; it is poetry that is painstakingly crafted.
  Every time one sees the movie one discovers new things, a hallmark of a great work. One of the most interesting things is the sound. Not the music; the sound of feet, the screeching wheels and car engines, children playing in the background, the clap of thunder, the jazz playing on the streets, the dialing of a phone, an eagle cawing, the slow measured voices, and also the silences; the sound editing is perfectly executed and significantly heightens the tension of the movie. This is a movie that one could hear, not see, and yet be enthralled.
Coppola makes great use of contrasting sounds and images at the same time. For instance, ominous dialogues are set against backdrop of chatter of children playing and playful jazz music. After Hagen is kidnapped by Solozzo there is a cynical shot of a Santa Claus in a shop window.
  There are many subtle symbolisms. There is the scene where when Michael learns that his father has been shot he is agitated and calling home from a public booth. In the background Kay is standing outside the booth, with the glass separating them looking anxiously at him. It is a sign of the rift that will now develop between them.
  A notable feature is the transition of one scene to another. After the shot showing the cut off head of Woltz's horse the picture dissolves into a shot of the Godfather, his face impassive, his chin determined. After the bridal scene of Michael and Apollonia, the shot changes to Kay entering the Corleone house. Such transitions speak volumes.
  Coppola takes time with his scenes. The scene with Michael and Solozzo in the restaurant is an example. It's builds up very slowly. At one point the camera waits for the waiter to cork open a bottle of wine while Solozzo and Michael eye each other, one with suspicion, and the other with suppressed hostility. Coppola very painstakingly builds the ambience of each scene with his measured progression, so that we are completely drawn into this haunting world. Whether it's the Don holding court, the Woltz mansion, a street, a hospital, a restaurant, Sicily, a graveyard or a church, all the time we are there, in the scene, living it all the way. Though this is a thoroughly romanticized depiction of the gangster world, it all seems real. The director slowly engrosses the viewer into the scene and builds it up to a climax. This approach is carried scene by scene. Each scene ends with a mini-climax and the movie progresses climax by climax to its thundering and numbing end.

  The last segment of Part 1 - the baptism, the end of Carlo Rizzi, and the confrontation between Kay and Michael - is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.
  There is nothing superfluous in the film, each little detail builds the picture into a whole, heightening the drama, increasing our understanding of characters and adding additional strokes to the large and sprawling canvas on which it is depicted.

  Today, three generations on, the Godfather films remain, in addition to being shattering celluloid masterpieces, an educating experience in the art of film-making to movie artisans and a lesson to audiences in the discerning skill of film appreciation.",1065225600,3,4888,4.749704840613932

Two years later, this film adaptation appeared and I have since seen it (as well as Godfather Part II) more than a dozen times. Francis Ford Coppola deserves all of the praise and awards these films have received over the years. He should also be admired for insisting that Pacino and Brando be cast in two of the major roles despite strong opposition from Paramount. Coppola assembled a superb cast but also an equally talented crew. Those who share my high regard for it no doubt have their own favorite scenes. Mine include Michael's enlistment of a bewildered young man's assistance at the hospital until members of the Corleone family arrive to protect their don, the sequence in the restaurant which results in the killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey, Tom Hagen's discussion with Jack Woltz during dinner, Michael's reunion conversation with Kay as they stroll in a New England village, and the montage of executions during the baptism. None of the extensive violence in the film seems gratuitous. Each major character is fully developed. The cinematography and score are outstanding, although neither was even nominated for an Academy Award. Dark as this film often is, it also has its lighter moments, as during the wedding celebration when Luca Brasi rehearses his remarks before presenting a gift and later when Clemenza teases Michael good-naturedly about Kay Adams. For me, the single most interesting element in the film is Michael's gradual development from his family's baby brother (albeit a war hero) to its ruthlessly efficient don. Once he volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, his destiny is assured. In some respects, this film reminds me of an opera but one with a multi-dimensional plot as well as grandeur in its style, scope, and emotional impact. In 1998, the American Film Institute selected The Godfather as one of the three greatest American films. Only Citizen Kane and Casablanca were ranked higher.",1056672000,33,2014,5.051051051051051

1181311,5,B000003KHS,"A host of factors make this one of the greatest American films.  First, the directing is impeccable.  Coppola allows the story to unfold simply, employing for the most part a static, immobile camera, allowing each scene to unfold like a series of tableaux.  Second, the cinematography.  Most of the craft of the cinematography went into the lighting, which generates some of the greatest use of light and shadows since the demise of black and white film noir.  Coppola also intensifies each scene by using surprisingly little music in the film.  Although the film is famous for its outstanding score by Nina Rota (later discovered to have been partially reused from an obscure film he scored in the late 1950s in Italy, which led to his nomination for an Oscar to be withdrawn, an award he certainly would have won), the fact is that the music is used selectively and comparatively rarely.  Silence engulfs most of the scenes.  And although there are many famous lines in the film, it is driven as much by the silence between the characters as by what they say.  Also accounting for the brilliance of the film is the script, which is brilliant for its simplicity.  Coppola distills the tale down to only the most essential elements, with nearly every shot moving the story along or imparting a crucial piece of information to the viewer, allowing the crucial tensions of the story to unfold early on.  The enormous simplicity in the telling of the tale makes the more complex momentsfor instance, the crosscutting during the baptismal sceneall that much more effective.  And any listing of all the reasons for the brilliance of the film leaving out the extraordinary art design would be woefully incomplete.  This was one of the first films made that made historical accuracy a high art form, and has exerted a profound influence on any historical film since then.
Of course, one of the main reasons this is a great, great film is the acting.  Few films have ever featured so many memorable performances, and no film had featured so many performances by so many actors who were explicitly Italian.  In fact, the film was a coming out for one aspect of Italian culture in the United States.  Even in films that were fairly transparently about the Mafia and crime families in New York and Chicago, ethnicity was completely left out of the picture.  After THE GODFATHER, everything changed.  The film was Marlon Brandos triumphant return to star status after a series of failures, garnering a well-served Oscar that he turned down.  The quality of the acting is shown by the fact that no less than three of the other actorsAl Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caanreceived nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Joel Grey won for CABERET, in what might have been the greatest group of performances in the history of Oscar for the award).
There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER.  My favorite, and one of the happier accidents in casting history, was that originally Robert De Niro was cast in a small part in THE GODFATHER.  Al Pacino, on the other hand, was wanted for the part of Michael Corleone, but was already obligated for the film BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY.  Francis Ford Coppola worked out a deal whereby De Niro would replace Pacino in the one picture.  Unfortunately/fortunately this meant that De Niro was unable to be in THE GODFATHER, which meant that he was free to appear in THE GODFATHER II as the young Vito Corleone.  THE GODFATHER was a film where just about everything seemed to work out best for all involved, and this illustrates this perfectly.",1054339200,11,3579,4.810457516339869

He is the youngest son of ""The Godfather"" Vito Corleone who is played by Marlon Brando.  In this film, Vito Corleone is trying to increase his crime organization, but will always say no to narcotics.  He ends up being the victim of a hit.  Now the rest of the Corleone family try to fix things up and this is where the story begins to pick up.  I don't want to say too much more, but this is a must see, because many more people like the movie more than I do and it is known by everyone, so it is like a basic movie that is important to the history of movies.

You just can't miss when you put together the direction of Francis Ford Coppola at the top of his game, superb performances from great actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and John Cazale, beautiful music from the composer Nino Rota, and a memorable cinematography courtesy of Gordon Willis.
There are a lot of timeless scenes in this mob film (""I believe in America""), plenty of quoting lines (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""), fabulous supporting characters (Luca Brasi), and the list can go on and on and on. In my opinion, this is the movie that beats all the rest of the films. I think that all movie fan collection must include ""The Godfather"". If you haven't seen it yet and you are looking for a fantastic film, go see a classic film, go see ""The Godfather"".
Absolutely recommendable.",1046476800,3,977,4.6531791907514455
1181314,5,B000003KHS,"So what can be written about the movie that hasn't been said a million times already?  Probably nothing.  But it is my favorite movie of all time.  I can't say it was catching lightening in a bottle, as several of the actors were famous before, and several more continue to be popular today.  Although it is one of those rare achievements where the cinema version outshines it's literary equivalent.
Movies have the power to create worlds entirely different to us, and in a sense, ""The Godfather"" is one of those movies.  Yes, there is organized crime, and yes, they still seem to have ""families"" to distinguish one group from another.  But this movie still created a different world by having no character that was not part of this world in the cast.  They are either involved in something illegal, or related to someone who is.
With this isolation, it makes us look at the film differently than if there were so-called ""honest"" people as part of the movie.  If that were the case, it would be easier to be reminded that these people are criminals.  And not just petty ones.  We see murderers, big time drug dealers, and those that spend large dollars corrupting the so-called ""legitimate"" government.
Since everyone is more or less playing by these rules, it then makes it easier to root for what would be the bad guys otherwise.  Vito Corleone has murdered, and ordered the murders of others.  But since we have not been told of the innocent people that were probably killed as part of his ascension, and the fact that he was not eager to get into big-time drug operations, and he was just, well, a grandfatherly old man, he's the ""good guy"" over that dastardly Barzini.
So we care that he truly loves his daughter and wants to give her a good wedding.  We think he's a good guy because he didn't want ""all of this"" for Michael.  And we agree that when he says ""a man who does not spend time with his family is not a real man"", that this is wisdom from what must be a very wise man.  Showing that this type of family can indeed love and care for each other while still taking care of business is what makes the film great in my eyes.",1042502400,4,2136,4.455012853470437

1181316,4,B000003KHS,"A groundbreaking masterpiece on the topic of mafia culture in the USA during the 70's and 80's. There are two main characters but let's start with the head. Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone head of the Corleone crime syndacite, one of the many families that dominates New York at this current time. He has a daughter and three sons, Fredo, Sonny and most importantly Micheal played wonderfully by Al Pacino. Young Micheal though is no gangster but a young boy next door who is full of potential. Micheal has only one dream, not to be like his family, not to become a ruthless gangster.
  Through the course of the film Vito is offered money to share his powerful connections with a rival gang which is not going to happen and this can mean only one thing, war! War that will lead to Sonny being double crossed and murdered and leading to Vito having many attempts on his life which he miraculously survives. When Vito dies and with Sonny dead it is Micheals turn to head the family which he accepts and does all to well...
  This film introduced the whole 'horses head on your pillow' thing which is a scene in the beggining. It also features the moment when Micheal turns gangster, murdering two other figure heads in a New York restraunt at point blank range.
  How anyone can say they haven't seen the Godfather is beyond me and I'm sure you'll agree with me. In my opinion this is even better than Part II and by a long way the best mafia flick to this day. This movie has just been voted the 2nd best movie in a British pole losing out to Star Wars, out doing every other movie ever made. Epic!",1041292800,,1600,4.425170068027211

Built closely around Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the movie captures quite brilliantly the transistion of power from Don Vito Corleone to his son Michael. Perhaps this is one movie that follows the book almost page to page. Some of the dialogues are exactly the same.
This film also saw the best of Marlon Brando, and the first of some sterling perfomances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall.

1181321,5,B000003KHS,"Generally regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, ""The Godfather"" would seem to be review-proof.  By this point, some 30 years after its initial release, what else could be said of it?  Critically it's adored.  And those who loathe it are bound to loathe it no matter what I, or anyone else really, has to say.
So instead of doing a standard review, I thought I'd pick out key elements from the movie, elements that struck me as important after my fourth and most recent viewing, but that I haven't seen analyzed to death over the years.  This effort will, I hope, shed some new light on the film, going beyond the usual iconic moments (the horse in the bed; the cat on the lap; Sonny at the tollbooth) and memorable dialogue (""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse""; ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""; ""Leave the gun... take the cannoli"") to give you something personally relevant.  And if doesn't, then at least it gave me the opportunity to write about ""The Godfather"" for awhile.
""I believe in America.""  These are the film's opening lines.  Spoken not by Marlon Brandon, Al Pacino, James Caan or even, say, Abe Vigoda, but by Salvatore Corsitto as Bonasera the Undertaker.  It begins a long speech about how his daughter was beaten to near death, and as Corsitto tells the tale, the camera slowly zooms out to reveal the darkened office, and then the silhouetted visage of Brando.  It begins a curious game of cat and mouse, for it takes a long time for the film to truly reveal whom this story is about.  Now, unless you've been living under a rock for the last thirty years, or, more appropriately, been locked in the trunk of a Cadillac, you know whose story is about to be told.  But let's wipe away hindsight, and assume you are an audience member in a darkened theatre in 1972, one who hasn't read Mario Puzo's soon-to-be-blockbuster book, who'd forgotten the power of Marlon Brando (it had been almost 20 years since ""On the Waterfront""), and had never heard of Al Pacino.
The first scene makes it clear that Vito Corleone is a powerful presence.  Is this his story?  It would seem so, as his family is gathered together for the luxurious wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  But then Vito's consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is introduced, a lawyer who was once taken in by Vito while just an orphan child.  Maybe it is the story of these two men, the Sicilian-born Don and his German-Irish adopted son.  This idea is nearly cemented when Tom goes to Hollywood, ostensibly to get Johnny Fontaine (Al Martino) out of a binding contract with Jack Woltz (John Marley), but more likely just as an excuse to put a horse's head in a bed.  Back in New York, we are introduced to Sonny (Caan), Vito's eldest boy, a hotheaded gorilla more proficient at quenching his animal lusts than at running a crime family.  Is it Sonny's story?  Could be, could be.  See what I mean?  It's like a great game of chess: director Francis Ford Coppola deploys his pawns, his rooks, his knights, and his bishops, before ever moving his Queen.  But when she finally emerges from her sanctuary, the board is wiped clean with a few bold moves.
Michael (Pacino), in these early expository scenes, only acts as a Greek chorus.  A war hero and a college boy, he explains to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) who his father is, and why he should be feared.  And he tries to tell her that that is not him.  But then comes the scene at the hospital.  Vito has been shot, but not killed, and Michael goes to visit him.  Surprised to find no security by his father's room, and aware that this means men are on their way to finish the job, Michael, along with a nurse, decides to move his father to another room.  After a near-farcical scene of hide-and-seek in the hospital halls, Michael, in an attempt to reassure his frightened father, whispers the following lines into the old man's ear: ""I'm with you now.  I'm with you.""  The double meaning of these words is made quite apparent by Vito's smile and Michael's angst-filled expression.  Just when he thought he was out of the family business, circumstances pull him back in.  Michael's inevitable coronation, and the film's operatic aftermath, is now inevitable.
About 110 minutes into the movie, Sonny finds out that Connie's husband Carlo (Gianni Russo) has been slapping her around.  Ever the vigilant brother, Sonny storms out to teach Carlo a lesson.  He finds him on the steps of a brownstone selling drugs, and before Carlo knows what's happening, Sonny is wailing on him mercilessly with punch after punch of staggering power.  Er, all except the fourth one, that is.  Maybe the filmmakers only had time for one take, or maybe a sloppy editor missed it, but the fourth punch misses Carlo by a good 2 feet.  Now, I'm a big believer in the adage, ""The exception proves the rule.""  And this moment is the film's one blemish, standing out like the Glad garbage man at a Goth convention.  But sandwiched between the film's first and second half, it manages to prove the perfection achieved by each.
I first saw ""The Godfather"" after reading the book as a teenager.  Not the best way to view any film, and nearly fatal here.  I expected to find a lot of the book's rich backstory but didn't.  My first viewing was a disappointment.  Every subsequent viewing, however, has made me fall more in love with this film than I ever thought possible.  And now you know why I chose this alternate method of reviewing: I knew that the hyperbole would flow fast and furious once I begin typing.  Despite my best intentions, I couldn't avoid it.  That is, ultimately, the power of ""The Godfather"".",1029283200,11,5651,4.611611611611612
1181322,5,B000003KHS,"At just under four hours, this is a long film, but one that holds the viewer riveted. Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, comes back from World War II as a hero. His family are leading mobsters and it is a life he wants to reject, but his hand is forced when his father, Don Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is shot down in the street. Slowly and reluctantly, he gets sucked into the vortex of the Mob, proving himself every bit as ruthless as his rivals.
This film reveals perfectly the analogy between 20th Century gangsters and the aristocracy. Not the effete aristocracy of the modern age but that of antiquity: when brutality and nobility went together; when power came from brute strength. This is what Thomas Paine had to say about the aristocracy:
  ""It could have been no difficult thing....for a banditti of ruffians to overrun a country [and] their power being thus established, the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of monarch and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings.""  `The Rights of Man.'
  If Don Corleone had been born in the pre-democratic age, his descendants would now have lands and respectable titles. Don Corleone insists people call him Godfather: In a previous age it would have been King, Duke, Baron, or Prince. It all means the same. Splendour sits side by side with violence. There are no ethics, only power. Everything else is a faade.
This was made in the 70s, when Coppola made genuinely great films. It's a compelling story beautifully told. The pacing is steady but never slow. The performances are flawless: the cinematography beautiful. Come the 80s, his genius would desert him. However, his classic films are still around and show just how powerful a medium film can be.

1181326,5,B000003KHS,"This movie puts me at a loss for words. It works on so many different levels--it is both an epic family drama and a story about how power corrupts--that I just don't know where to start. The acting is incredibly, some of the best I have ever seen. Marlon Brando gives the performance of a lifetime as Don Veto Corleone, the family patriarch. But even better is Al Pacino, riveting and edgy as Corleone's son, Michael, who grows from an idealistic young man ashamed of his ""family business"" to the new godfather, a cold, harsh executioner. The cinematography is another element of the film which adds to the atmosphere and overall quality of the film. Using mostly eye-level camera angles and simple but profound shots that give the feeling of something made during the forties or fifties (at which time, the story is set), the camerawork perfectly captures the simplicity but importance of the message this film tells. The editing adds another dimension to Pacino and Brando's compelling performances. There are countless jump cuts, very short takes, very long takes, and an overall uneven, jumpy quality. On the other hand, Nino Rota's classical, mellow score balances out the unnerving performances and editing--much like the way the family drama keeps in balance the intense, gritty, violent scenes of organized crime in action. Particularly, the baptism scene is perhaps the most riveting, shockingly ironic sequence I have ever witnessed in cinema.

The film is primarily shot in New York, although there are many scenes where we see Michael Corleone, the youngest of the clan, in Italy after fleeing America.
The film is a brilliant piece of work, one could even describe as a piece of artwork, as the grandeur takes hold on anyone watching the film. The cast list consists of great actors, almost legendary with Marlon Brando playing The Godfather himself, Vito Corleone, we see James Caan playing the part of Sonny, Vito's eldest son, Robert Duvall plays the part of the family counselor and the famous Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone.
Diane Keaton has the role of Kay, Michael's girlfriend.
It doesn't take long for watchers of this film to consider conflicting parts of this film, as we see Vito Corleone at a fruit stand in the middle of town, where he faces situational irony, as he is gunned down in the streets by opposing mafia families.  He has no control over the attempt on his life; at this moment he has no power in order to control the situation at hand, only at the mercy of the bullets penetrating his body. We see Michael's mental complications come to life in the Italian restaurant scene, where he plans on avenging the attempted assassination of his father.  He retrieves the gun hidden in the bathroom and comes out with a cool sense about him, sits down without saying anything and suddenly stands up and shoots the man primarily responsible for the attempt on Vito's life and then the police Captain, the same police Captain that broke his jaw outside of the hospital where his father lay fighting for his life.
Michael finds himself hiding in the hillsides of Sicily, where he soon falls in love and marries, only to have his wife blown up in a car bomb that was meant for him.  He returns to America after the news of his brother's murder, but he is a different man, has a different demeanor when he returns home. He is dead set on following in his father's footsteps.  Near the end of the film we hear Michael use the phrase used by his father so many times in the past, ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"", which usually meant either do it my way, or die.  Certainly this film deserves 5 stars!  Coppola is brilliant with his direction of the film based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the two team up to make this one of America's classic films.  Perhaps even a film that during the time it was released in 1972, Americans were facing a war of their own in Vietnam.

Realizing that the entire second section of the novel could not be fit into the movie (but was cleverly woven into ""The Godfather, part 2"") Puzo and Coppola produced a film which was remarkably consistent with the remainder of the book (although there are a few 'jumps' in the plot which make more sense to someone also familiar with the book). The cast for this picture could not possibly be better -- both in the first-rate Hollywood actors AND in the on-location Sicilian actors selected for those portions of the movie filmed on that island. Brando is perfect as the aging Don, Pacino portrays the inherently moral but tormented Michael extremely well, Caan is ideal as the hotheaded Sonny, and Robert Duvall, in the best role of his career, is splendid as Tom Hagen.

1181334,5,B000003KHS,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel written by Mario Puzo, stands as one of the great achievements of American film. Here's three reasons why.
The performances. Surprisingly enough, even for people who have seen the movie numerous times, Marlon Brando's not really in it all that much. He won the Oscar for Best (Lead) Actor (which he turned down), he's on the unforgettable film poster, and he's what everyone thinks about when they think about ""The Godfather."" But don't be fooled. Though he's unsurpassably great and very worthy of his accolades, he's not the lead, nor is his the best performance in the film. That honor belongs to Al Pacino. In the performance that made him a star and will make him a legend, Pacino exhibits incredible power and elicits extraordinary compassion for a mass murderer. He does this in a far more subtle way than he is won't to do nowadays (including his own Oscar winning turn). The supporting cast is flawless, especially James Caan, Diane Keaton, and the dearly departed John Cazale.
The story. Puzo's novel was great, and the film only improved on it. Everyone knows by now that ""The Godfather"" is not really about the Mafia as much as it's about family. Not just Sicilian families, either. The two central characters in the story are almost wholly motivated by a desire to help the family, and it is for this reason that the film magically manages to portray these people as heroes. Their occupation is secondary; their relationships with their loved ones and how those relationships affect their occupational choices reigns.
The scenes. All great films, but especially those of the ""Godfather"" trilogy, are made of great individual scenes. Witness: the scene in the hospital where Michael attempts to move his father's hospital room to avoid his murder, with the help of Enzo the baker. The immortal opening wedding scene, interspresed with the favor requests (which no Sicilian can turn down on the day of his daughter's wedding). The scene where Michael defines himself as a Corleone, not an American, but a Sicilian living in America, when he murders a mob boss and a corrupt cop in cold blood to avenge the attempt on his father's life.

The story is superb. Although it is about the mafia, it has far more to do with the Corleone Family, than the Corlone Crimes. Also, Al Pacino's performance is wonderful, as is James Caan's.

1181341,5,B000003KHS,"Francis Ford Coppola directed an absolute masterpiece on film when he made the immortal classic ""The Godfather"", which was adapted from Mario Puzo's best selling book about the inner working and ordeals of the Corleone Family who was head of the powerful Mafia organization. An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why.
The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka ""The Godfather"", Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the ""innocent"" son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" as the adviser to the Don.  The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.
The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway.  It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family.  I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil any of it, since it is a movie ""you cant refuse"" to see.  The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is ""Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"".
The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam ""Boom Boom"" Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.
This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time.  This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family.",980035200,15,2161,4.646596858638744
1181342,5,B000003KHS,"The Godfather Part 1 was the greatest movie ever done. Right from the very beginning it holds your interest. It starts with Michael Corleone, the youngest, getting into the family business when he never wanted to. Throughout the whole movie, Michael shows himself to be the best candidate for being the new Don. He is smart, cunning, and knows when to speak and when not to. He is also a very logical and practical man, which comes in handy when creating plans to eliminate the enemy. Another reason that this is a great movie is the actors. Al Pacino does a wonderful job as Michael Corleone. He carries himself through the movie and never loses sight of what is going on. He immerses himself in the character and its almost as if he forgets who he is and becomes Michael Corleone. Marlon Brando also does a wonderful job of acting, though his part is in fact very small. He seemed to know just how his character should be. It was a natural part for him and it almost seemed as if he wasn't even acting. The part was so natural for him that it was like he knew just how the mob was and how they worked. This movie was done very well. The plot always moved along, never stalling at any point. From the very beginning at Connie's wedding, you knew something was going to happen. You could pick up on small clues throughout the whole wedding. The first one I noticed was the one the way the Don was doing business. He saw everyone because ""an Italian man can not refuse business on his daughter's wedding day."" The clue wasn't in the business itself, it was in the way he handled it. He wasn't as sharp as he would've been, at least I thought. He wanted to be at the wedding enjoying it rather than in his office doing business. It seemed as if he was half paying attention, not really caring about the people's problems. He just wanted to be with his family and friends. The other thing that made this movie so great was the rest of the characters. All of the characters in this movie were believable. The idea of them wasn't so far out there that no one could believe it. Sonny is the hotheaded son who wants to take the business over but can't because of his temper. Fredo is the middle child who was ignored and never given the chance or even the thought to take over the business. Michael wasn't going to take the business over because he wanted nothing to do with the family business, that is, until he realized just how good he was at it. Connie would never be allowed to take over the business just for the fact that she was a woman. Her husband would not be allowed the business just because he was an outsider to the family. Just knowing these simple facts along with the time period, 1945ish, shows just how believable the characters are. This movie was a good story with great actors and a wonderful director. Everything about it was great. I would strongly recommend that you see it. I would also recommend reading the novel by Mario Puzo. He knows what a good story is.",978912000,5,2981,4.382671480144404
1181343,5,B000003KHS,"The Godfather is the finest film in the Mafia genre. The film creates an intriguing world of violence and power that completely engrosses a viewer and draws them into the movie. The storyline, the characters, and the action all contribute to the overall success of the film, and the visuals and setting are very realistic. The film clearly demonstrates the world view of the Mafia and how it differsfrom other criminal organizations.  From the wedding scene at the start of the film, the viewer is transported to the world of the Corleone family and the office of Don Corleone, the Godfather. This portion of the film does an excellent job at introducing the characters and giving a good explanation of what the Corleone family business entails. It was also an opportunity forthe son Michael to explain to his girlfriend Kay, who is ignorant of the criminal extent of the family, how the Corleones conduct business. This allows a viewer to immediately recognize the characters that are central to the story, the basic structure of the Mafia family, and what direction the movie is going.  The movie begins shortly after the end ofWorld War II. This marked a very important and successful period in the United States, and the Corleone family paralleled this. The movie follows the family as they expanded their power and influence in the New York underworld and the price that had to paid to accomplich this success.  The greatest asset to the film were the characters. Vito Corleone, expertly played by Morlon Brando, is the head of the crime family and is developed wonderfully throughout the course of the movie. His thoughts and actions demonstrate how he was able to attain and control so much power in the violent and changing underworld. By making offers that no one could refuse, usuallythrough the use of a firearm, and showing generosity to his friends, he is able to control and rule withnot only fear, but also respect. Vito's youngest son Michael, played by Al Pacino, is another fully developed character that makes this movie a success. The movie follows Michael as he first refuses to be a part of the family business, begins to assume responsibility for the family ""business"", assassinates two enemies of the family, and is later thrust into the role of Don after the death of his father. The change that takes place in Michael is gradual and movie does a great job showing how circumstances thrust Michael into his father's position, and how he suceeded in maintaining power over the rival Mafia families.  The director does an excellent job of not allowing violence to dominate the storyline and action of the film. It is true that many characters were killed or suffered dire consequences, but muchof the action of the film is in the dialogue and interaction between characters. The director realized that the threat of violence and allusions to violent consequencews held as much influence in the actions of the characters as actual violence. The Mafia is shown to be a business and the heads of the criminal organizations understood that decisions had to be based on thoughtful not impulsive actions. The visuals in this movie are wonderful. The dim overcast look of the film is very appropiate to the mood and subject matter,and the editing, especially the baptism scene at the end of the film, creates a sense of intrigue. The film's version of New York City during this time period is very realistic and bears mentioning. Portions of the movie also take place in Sicily. These scenes were also very credible and helped to both transport a viewer to the time period and also gives a glimpse of the environment tht the Mafia culture was born from. The Godfather is a wonderful movie that can appeal to a wide variety of people. The characters in the film were well developed and interesting. The film was also successful in its engrossing storyline and dialogue and did not have to resort to violence and action to hold the interest of the audience. The setting and cinematography is first rate and believable,and can transform a viewer into the film. Overall, The Godfather is one of the greatest American films, and I would recommend this movie.",978912000,6,4169,4.867605633802817
1181344,5,B000003KHS,"The Godfather wasn't just about gun toting gangsters.  If it were, it wouldn't put to shame every other mafia style movie in existence today, as it has.  This movie is a story of epic proportions.  The film opens up at a wedding reception for the daughter of a major crime family in New York.  The movie goes on to depict the life and times of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando); From his rise to power, to his death, and then to the passing of the name ""Don"" to his son Michael (Al Pachino).
It's not often that a film intertwines as many plots and subplots, as well as ""The Godfather"" has does.  Strong writing, directing, and acting also contribute to the success of the film.  This movie was not just put together overnight.  It was painstakingly crafted as to make it as realistic as possible.  Every character, even the minor ones were molded to be as complex as possible.  They were each given individual backgrounds, character, and little clicks that push this movie above and beyond and five stars.
The Corleone that ended up getting the most time on screen was Michael.  Which might have been a sign for the future.  The Godfather 2 was almost entirely based around Michael and his family.  In the Godfather the movie is a build up to the rise and fall of Vito, but always having Michael as an underlying theme.  Michael started the movie as a good, law-abiding citizen.  In fact he was a war hero in world war two.  At first he wanted nothing to do with the ""family business"".  But as the movie progressed he got more and more intertwined with the family and ended up killing two men.  He then left the country.  At that point there was no return to normal life for him.  He was now dodging hits left and right, doing anything he could just to stay alive.  But soon he began to love it and thrive off of it.  After his father died he became the ""Don"" and started taking charge of the family.
This movie in my book is worthy of much more than five stars.  It is a classic that deserves recognition.  If you ever get a chance to view it definitely check it out.  If you are not satisfied, I will take your copy.  J

1181345,5,B000003KHS,"Jeff Sweet The Perfect Mobster Movie The Godfather is one of the best films I`ve viewed in a long time.  The film possessed an excellent view of the mob life, great actors, and a perfect ending that could and did lead to an awesome sequel.  When thinking of the mob life, Italian Mafia, one may think of money, murder, trust, and back stabbing, all of which this movie contained.  The basis of this story was about how the Corleone family went from nothing to one of the largest mafia families in New York.  They accomplished this by making money, though not always legit, but that's how the mob does it.  When the family dealt with a lot of money, they also had to know whom they could and couldn't trust.  There were some people that worked for the Corleone family that got greedy and in turn betrayed the trust of the family.  In the mafia, when someone superior, like the Godfather, doesn't trust you, you end up ""sleeping with the fish"" and there was plenty of sleeping in the ocean in this movie.  The cast of actors for this film was remarkable, but two actors shined above the rest.  Marlon Brando, the Godfather, was an excellent actor.  He played the role of an older heavyset man that people came to for favors because of the power and connections he possessed.  He was a family man and he was a businessman.  The best part of his role was he was always calm and was soft spoken with a combination of an Italian and New York accent.  The other actor was Al Pacino who played Michael, one of the three sons' of the Godfather.  Michael went from not wanting anything to do with the crooked lifestyle, to killing people and becoming the head of the Corleone family.  Michael, like his father was also soft spoken and calm yet had the coldness to put hits out on people.  No matter what the circumstances, these two men always got what they wanted by any means necessary.  Not many movies have the ability to set up for a good sequel.  This one was an exception.  The movie ended very much like it started.  In the beginning, the Godfather, Marlon Brando, was in his office talking with his ""people"" about doing some illegal business for some friends.  At the end of the film, you sensed that the new Godfather, Al Pacino, was also talking about dirty business with his fellow mobsters.  The last scene was the Godfather's office door being closed on the conversation making it perfect for a new door to open.  It was the perfect ending for a new beginning.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes an exciting movie that always keeps you on the edge of your seat.  There are many twist and turns never allowing you to know who's working for who and what's going to happen next.  It also lets you, for a few hours, to live the life of a mobster in the comfort of your own home.  It's jam packed with excellent actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino that do a superb and believable job as if they really were in the Corleone family.  Finally, the movie ends perfect making it feel that you almost have to see the Godfather II.",978825600,,3044,4.416517055655296
1181346,4,B000003KHS,"Mario Puzo's novel is brought to life on screen in Godfather. The story of the Corleone family and the Mafia. Puzo co-wrote the screenplay with Francis Ford Coppola, also the director of the film. This is a great movie of the story of one family and the rise and fall of that family's sons.  The movie has realistic actors and compelling characters that keep us on the edge of our seats.  Al Pacino plays Michael, the youngst of the three sons, who takes over the father's position as head of the Corleone family.  Pacino does a great job holding our attention.  Pacino can light up the screen and keep us interested.  He leads us through the film with excitement. Michael's rise to Don Corleone is a great story. He picks up the role of the Don unexpectedly and runs with it. You see him change throught out the movie.  You may move him in the beginning and hate him in the end.  He makes his change from a war hero to the ruthless leader of the most powerful family in the Mafia. This movie is a great story of family life in the mafia. The importance of the father son relationship.  From the first immigrants to the children carrrying on the family name and more importantly the family business.  Family is stressed greatly in the film.  But it's how the family is defined that's different.  The Corleone family is not just made up of immediate family(example wives and children). The Corleone family is huge and is considered a business.  The ""Family"" encompasses many other smaller families to create a large ""business"". Godfather introduces a new type of family to us. This movie was very interesting and keeps you thinking.  There is a great amount of history in this movie.  It protrays the book wonderfully.  Having Puzo co-write the film gave a great deal of truth to the book.  Overall this was a great movie.  Some may be bothered by the violence but it is nothing like the violence we see in the movies today.  The violence in the Godfather is the violence we see on everyday television.  Without the violence you do not have story of the mafia and the story of the Corleone family.  This is the greatest explaination of the Corleone family and the Mafia.",978825600,2,2169,4.555555555555555
1181347,5,B000003KHS,"Hold on to your popcorn and soda, The Godfather is going to be a bumpy ride!  Mario Puzo's novel turned movie is about a man named Don Corleone, played by actor Marlon Brando, and his family.  We enter the movie in a dark room.  A man is pleading for the Don to help him where the courts could not.  The man's daughter's attackers go free after they brutally assault her, leaving the man to want true justice done on these boys.  The Don says he'll help.  The man will be called on for a favor later on in the movie.  This is how the Godfather runs his affairs: he does you a favor and you return a favor for him. Brando's traits, such as the soft voice and sagging cheeks, make the character out to be a hard man, one who wouldn't take anything sitting down.  I enjoyed watching him as the Don; what he would do next was what kept my attention.  Director Francis Ford Coppola's star-studded cast includes Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the adopted son of Corleone.  Other popular and well-known actors and actresses in this film are Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (son), James Caan as Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone (son), Talia Shire as Constanzia ""Connie"" Corleone (daughter), and Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend Kay Adams.  This movie is not one for the weak stomach.  Many scenes are filled with gangsters filling bodies with bullets and some scenes catch the viewer off guard.  Not to ruin the film for the viewer who has not yet seen it, but one of Corleone's sons is murdered.  He's on his way to defend his sister, Connie, and at a tollbooth, a rival ""family"" guns him down.  That is just one scene that will surprise you.  If you've heard of The Godfather, then you've probably heard of the second film in the trilogy, The Godfather, Part II.  This movie covers past and present, pushing us as viewers to readjust our mindset every time locations and dates change.  The first movie runs in order of events, and a viewer may find this easier to follow what is happening.  While The Godfather, Part II is an excellent and unique film on it's own, many moviegoers prefer the first film to the second and third. The action in this movie is phenomenal.  Puzo wanted to show the life that the Don and other mob members lived without ""sugar-coating"" anything.  Coppola knows this and portrays Puzo's novel very well.  The movie will fill you with emotion and leave you wanting to know more about the Corleone family.  But before you go and see the movie, remember to do three things: go to the bathroom (it's a long movie), find a comfortable chair, and sit back and relax as The Godfather unfolds.",978825600,,2596,4.523605150214593
1181348,5,B000003KHS,"The Godfather is an intricately told story of the Corleone family.  At its head is Don Vito Corleone, (The Godfather) played by the incomparable Marlon Brando.  It is the story of the twists and turns that shape this remarkable family's fate.  The story begins at Connie Corleone's wedding.  We get our first glimpse into the world of Don Corleone as he meets with ""associates"" as he, a sicilian, cannot refuse a request on the day of his daughter's wedding.  The requests made of such an extraordinary man are, as expected, extraordinary.  One man even requests that the men who abused his daughter be murdered.  The Don deals with all of these in a businesslike, brilliant, and truly fascinating manner.  We are made to wonder what he has done to make him such a power to be reckoned with.
The acting in this movie is without parallel.  We are all familiar with the vocaliztions and gestures that were made immortal by Brando.  Al Pacino, playing Michael Corleone, who is eventually to inherit his father's title, puts in an extraordinary performance.  We feel as though we are a part of his life as he struggles through the decisions he makes.  We can see plainly in his eyes the torture he is feeling and the precise moment when he knows he's given up any hope of a life outside of his father's ""business.""  Don Corleone's ""employees"" or henchmen are perfectly cast.  Well-known actors, such as Abe Vigoda, playing Tessio, were chosen for their large, imposing figures.  We knew that these men could probably do unthinkable things and yet they fascinate us.  It is well known that The Godfather has a larger impact on males than females who view it.  They see these men as all-powerful and invincible.  Though we see throughout the film that they are not, who would not wish to be so?
It is easy to fall into the narrative of this tale and hope for the Corleone's success.  Another brilliant stroke of filmmaking lends itself to this.  The story is entirely contained in the world of the Mafia.  If we were shown the consequences of their actions, the innocent lives lost, and the lives destroyed, we would surely have even more moral dilemmas on our hands.
Also lending to the artistic manipulation of an audience's feeling is the lighting and soundtrack for The Godfather.  Theirs is shown as a very dim world throughout the film. Pacino's scenes are even more so.  The half lighting of Pacino's face toward the end of the film when he has become Don is powerful even though we may not be aware of its meaning.  It shows the division between the person he wanted to be and the person he had become.  The soundtrack by Nino Rota, who has done many Fellini films, is melancholy and almost forces us to reminisce about the family's better times.
It is not difficult to come away with moral lessons from this film.  It is difficult to pick just one.  Do we get the feeling that all would have been well if they had just listened to The Godfather?  Or is this about trying to hold fast to your ideals?  Or maybe is it about the inevitability of growing farther away from those you love?  However you look at it, it all adds up to a masterpiece in our own time.",978652800,,3161,4.572953736654804

This movies chronicles some of the events that take place in the world of the Mafia. The attempt on Don Corleone and the revenge by Michael his youngest son. Especially interesting was the method employed by Don Corleone to convince the Hollywood producer to give the leading role in a war movie to his godson. One will never forget the horse's head in the bed. The death of Don Corleone and the assension to power by the youngest son Michael is also shown.

On one hand director Coppola gets the details of the Italian-American experience down to the minutest detail. He accomplishes this with great storytelling combing script, dialogue, performances and editing. Unfortunately the actions of these family members are so appealing to audiences that it in effect glamorizes a certain lifestyle and singles out a particular ethnic group. However using his great innovative techniques Coppola created a cultural phenomenon. From a cinematic viewpoint Coppola's direction simply wins the viewer over with such grace and appeal that there is no room for ethical consequences. For years director John Ford decimated thousands of American Indians under the watchful eyes of Monument Valley. Nobody seemed to mind much in the end.

The direction is, as you would expect from any Coppola film ( with the exception of Jack) faultless. There isn't a moment in the films long running time that you even think about anything but the life and trials of the troubled Corleone family. This is partly due to the fantastic performance of the supproting cast of Caan, Duvall, keaton etc.... Its partly due to the magnificent performance by the veteran thespian Brando. But its mainly due to the awe-inspiring debut by Al Pacino, as the young, prodigal son, whos honesty slowly decays as he climbs higher up the Mafia ladder.

1181361,5,B000003KHS,"Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top  100), ""The Godfather"" brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family.  America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this  film takes us inside ""The Family"" like never before.
The script is nearly  flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets  up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and  intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with  them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or  gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.
However,  the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and  the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that  it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have  such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of  ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand  that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have  their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.
Though this was  more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out,  namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established  superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few  years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding.  Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See ""On  The Waterfront"", ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", or ""Mutiny On The Bounty""),  yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our  notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a  shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He  presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and  an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other  families.
Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to  his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered  a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a  great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is  ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching  romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and  established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.
Other  standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the  hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and  visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming  character with a strong sense of family loyalty.
This film was nominated  for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for  Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually  own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it  yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.  It  is an utterly perfect 10.",968371200,8,3095,4.739130434782608
1181362,5,B000003KHS,"Yes, this is probably the best film ever made. A lot come close (`Citizen  Kane', `Casablanca', etc.) but `The Godfather' has been proven a perennial  favorite between the audience since it's release over 25 years ago, and  still stands well. It is virtuoso filmmaking at it's absolute best,  everything from directing and acting to writing and score are done to  perfection. Never a dull moment in the film, not a slow scene, not a bum  performance and nothing seems out of place. Coppola's first major film and  certainly his best, this was the offspring of his creative talent. His  direction in this film is flawless, every little detail fits together, and  even the casting was inspired, to create a moving and even nostalgic movie  experience. The acting is unbelievable a powerhouse ensemble cast, few  actors have worked so well together and in such beautifully synchronized  harmony, you really believe that this people are family. Marlon Brando, in  one of his definitive roles, delivers one of the best performances in his  career and in movie history. His portrayal of Don Corleone is  unforgettable, powerhouse method acting at the highest level. And also his  physical and emotional transformation from `aging Don' to `old Don' is pure  brilliance. Brando will be remembered as one of the greatest actors of his  generation and it will be mainly because of this film, and of course  because of his other great performances in films like `A Streetcar Named  Desire' and `On The Waterfront'. Al Pacino also delivers what may well be  his best performance ever as Michael, even though he was equally good in  `The Godfather Part II'. Some of his scenes, namely the spellbinding murder  of Sollozzo and McCluskey, are so well acted it's scary. Robert Duvall is  also very impressive as Tom Hagen. James Caan delivers an astounding  performance as hot-headed Sonny, and John Cazale is equally compelling as  dim-witted Fredo, his character plays a small part here but would be  further developed in `The Godfather Part II'. As for the female cast, Diane  Keaton (in her pre-Woody Allen days) is perfect as the shut-out Kay. Talia  Shire, who also happens to be Coppola's sister, was an inspired choice to  play Connie, and even though she plays a small role here, she would grow as  an actress and her character would also grow more important in `The  Godfather Part II'. Richard S. Castellano and Abe Vigoda are typecast as  Don Corleone's Caporegime; Clemenza and Tessio respectively, they are  perfect in their roles, and even though they don't get any big scenes  they're still unforgettable. And then there's a whole line of memorable  supporting characters of which I'll name only a few; Jack Woltz (John  Marley), Barzini (Richard Conte), Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), Luca Brasi (Lenny  Montana), Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), etc. And then there's Al Martino as  Johnny Fontaine who is more than quietly made to resemble Frank Sinatra,  who was also rumored to be the Godson of an Italian family that may or may  not be mixed up in dirty business. Many say that this is the way he got the  part in `From Here To Eternity' that won him an Oscar. Then there are the  technical aspects of the film, which are dazzling. The Coppola-Puzo script  is perfection, memorable dialogue throughout and not one line of dialogue  seems out of place. The script follows no formulas or cliches it instead  created them. Easily among the best screenplays ever written. Gordon  Willis' dark cinematography is atmospheric, deeply evocative and captures  the film's essence perfectly. Coppola flew to Italy specifically to find  Nino Rota, who scored some of Fellini's films, to make the famous musical  score for `The Godfather'. He created one of the most famous scores of all  time, a haunting score that at the same time exudes nostalgia. To finish, I  want to say that this is not a crime film or an action film, it has those  elements in the plot, but it's basically a movie about family and the  succession of power through the generations. `The Godfather' remains one of  the most moving, expertly crafted films of all time and will always remain  as my all-time favorite. Extras: the infant that is being baptized is  actually Coppola's daughter Sofia. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  10! Masterpiece",968284800,2,4308,4.904166666666667

1181366,5,B000003KHS,"There are many classic scenes in ""The Godfather,"" but two of them stand out in my mind. The first is the long sequence that opens the film: the wedding day of the Don's daughter Connie. A parade of well-wishers and favor-seekers visits the Godfather, each seeking his favor and counsel. Thus it is established that this is an important man, a man of respect. When he finally steals away enough time to dance with his daughter, we cannot believe that this man is a criminal.
The sequence that closes the film is equally powerful: the christening of Connie's child (with Michael as his godfather), intercut with the murders of Michael's rivals for domination of the Mafia. Thus we learn that the son, too, is a man of respect, a man who will stop at nothing to continue his father's legacy.
These opening and closing scenes show us the transition of power and honor, from father to son. We see the importance of religion and tradition in the lives of these young Americans, as well as the depths of their hypocrisy. Michael is a new kind of leader, though. One with a vision beyond the violence, a vision of a better future. Like the Kennedys (who similarly rose from crime to respectability), the Corleones eventually rise above their sordid past. Despite their flaws, or perhaps because of them, they are a quintessentially American family.

Firstly, Brando puts so much personality  into this...  But the other actors were so good that this kickstarted their  careers.
Also, if you haven't read anything about the classic scenes  (living in a cave for so many years?  o. O) you won't expect anything that  happens.  Some excellent shots at certain places add to the tension of the  movie.

1181382,5,B000003KHS,"The acting, directing, and script of The Godfather was excellent and beyond reproach. I cannot think of another movie (esp. one that was 3 hrs.) that captivated me and kept me glued to the screen from start to finish.
However, for me the Godfather is an exercise in morality. And by that I  do not mean that they are monsters, etc. Although they are no Mahatma  Gandhi, they are moral in their own way.
Eg. most other gangster movies  portray their characters, even the protagonists as womenizers, heavy  drinkers, people who get pleasure out of causing pain to others. In short  they are portrayed as deplorable and morally corrupt individuals who abuse  their power and use it to rise above society.  For example in Goodfellas,  the mobsters park wherever they want without fear of getting a ticket, they  can play loud music without consequence etc.
Also, if someone were to  insult a Goodfella, then they would be killed or severely injured.
However, the Godfather is not so base. The characters (except for Sonny  and poss. Fredo) do not indulge themselves in petty vices. You don't see  Michael Corleone chasing women, drinking, indulging in violence, etc. And  those who do succumb to sensory pleasures come to an unfortunate end. In  the end, although Michael is a ""killer"" he only survives because  he is disciplined and does not excessively use his power for his own  benefit, but only for his family.
Also in the Godfather is a Gandhi like  forgiveness. Vito, when his son his killed, says ""I want no acts of  vengeance."" Even in part II when he is insulted by the landlord, he is  calm.  Mike is also calm when he is insulted by others and does not react.
The killing in the Godfather can be considered as that of a soldier.  Killing is not looked down upon currently in western society. Warfare is  accepted. People kill animals for food. The west frequently engages in  warfare to ""protect"" others. Some even argue that the US never  has humanitarian interests in mind when it goes into another far away  country, but is only acting to protect its own interests and force its  philosophy upon others.
In this way, the killings committed by the  Corleone family pale in comparison to what the government does. And what  the govt. does is no secret. It is accepted by the American people!
So  according to this line of reasoning, it makes no sense to criticize the  Godfather for violence, both on the part of the filmmaker and the  characters.
This movie helped me realize, when i was much younger, that  real power is not boisterous and loud, and does not assert itself even when  provoked. On the contrary, the person who does not react when confronted  and insulted by others, holds the trump card and is the real victor. Gandhi  knew this. And the fictional Corleone family knew this and that is why they  were the best!",961545600,,2837,4.695121951219512

1181384,5,B000003KHS,"This film feels like a suit of clothes that fits perfectly. The production is excellent, as is the acting, cinematography and music. What a wonderful job the director does! The story follows events in post-World War II  America where the mantle of Corleone family boss or Godfather is passed on.  The family is more than just next of kin but a network of hitmen,  racketeers, businessmen and wider connections in society. This story  unfolds to reveal a truth common to changes in power structures down  through history. The story telling is second to none. The sense of  importance and significance in each of the events and how it affects the  characters is masterfully played. From the wedding scene introducing the  characters and the peculiarities of the family, both regular and criminal,  to the assassinations while the crime boss renounces satan and all his  works at his sons christening, there is a depth of truth on how real these  events are. Hence the phrase ""It's business not personal"" the  family members use for justification. The choices people make and how they  make them is shown. The pull of family against individuality is  particularly strong in this movies explanation of the forces at work in a  persons life. It might go to explain the movies popularity. As well as this  the film has great depth with strong mythical elements in the background  like the Italian Catholic tradition. Of course, theres loads more going on  in the film between the characters, making it the fine drama it is  rightfully acclaimed to be.

1181386,5,B000003KHS,"Too many people believe this is a movie about violence.  It has violence, but more importantly, it is the story of one family, and more particularly, the story of one of that family's sons, Michael, as he slowly changes from  a naive war hero into a ruthless Mafia don.  This is the most mesmerizing  aspect of an incredible film.
 It is rare for a film that relies so  little on special effects for its power to be so popular.  It is with good  reason, however.  Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, he co-wrote the  screenplay with Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the movie.  It is  lushly presented in epic fashion and relies more on its gripping story,  inspired acting, and realistic, compelling characters than cheap  thrills.
 It is indicative of the talent displayed in this film that Al  Pacino, who plays Michael, the son who eventually inherits his father's  position as Don and is the most important character in the film, was  nominated for an Oscar as- get this- Best Supporting Actor.  Marlon Brando,  of course, won the Oscar for Best Actor.  All of the performances were  superb.  The only complaint I had was with Diane Keaton, who plays  Michael's wife.  Amidst all the talent, she stuck out as uninspired.  Perhaps it was simply a reflection of how good the rest of the film was.
  As a note, this film is worth waiting until it comes out on DVD.  VHS  doesn't quite do this film justice, even in widescreen, and it is sure to  come packed with interesting commentary.",958089600,20,1493,4.605363984674329

Brando was great, and so was Pacino...Sure, the movie is a bit long, so those with no attention span go home!  But the plot  is great, and it should keep you hooked!",922838400,,260,4.244897959183674

The story does a great job, in my opinion, of dually presenting the principle characters as criminals and ""family men"", and it's not given as a dichotomy, this really comes across as their ""normal"" life. So weddings and domestic disputes dovetail with murder and high level mob meetings in a striking and memorable narrative.

The staging and camera work, music, etc. all ""supporting elements"" of that ilk are so well done as to simultaneously fall away from notice and support the story, while yet remaining memorable and noteworthy in and of themselves.

One of my favorite movies ever. Highly recommended.",1524787200,,853,4.828767123287672
