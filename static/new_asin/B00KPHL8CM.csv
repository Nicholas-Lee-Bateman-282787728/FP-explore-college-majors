6437445,1,B00KPHL8CM,"The acting is unbelievably poor, especially Andrew Gray.  He is very stiff and unnatural , he could not act his way out of a paper bag. It is hard to believe he was offered this role.  I am assuming he is a model so they thought he would be eye candy, but his lack of acting is cringe worthy!",1408233600,,292,3.9322033898305087

8660556,5,B00KPHL8CM,This is a great finish to the Megaforce season and gives the rangers the ability to learn how to be better rangers and keep Earth safe from the evil trying to invade.

8660558,5,B00KPHL8CM,I have been a fan of Power Rangers since I was 14 and it is still one of my favorite shows. I would definitely recommend Power Rangers Megaforce A Battle To The Finish to any Power Rangers fan because it is really good. I have to say this DVD is a must have for any Power Rangers fan who is getting the show on DVD.,1410393600,2,315,3.8615384615384616
