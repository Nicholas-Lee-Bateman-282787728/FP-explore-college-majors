6931142,4,B00RI4VBUO,"the story line is a little drawn out which takes to the end of the movie. The end of the movie is a bit of a disappointment, i felt this should taken place three quarts into the movie to give the ending some time to develop properly. All said and done Forrest Whitaker is a brilliant actor!",1425772800,,290,4.105263157894737
6931143,3,B00RI4VBUO,"The film centers on three people in a border New Mexico county. Bill Agati (Harvey Keitel) is the local sheriff. The county has recently hired a new parole officer (Brenda Brethyn)  who is fair and honest. William Garnett (a slim Forest Whitaker) has been recently paroled. He was a drug dealer working for Terence (Luis Guzmn) and he also killed the deputy (One Clapton mystery solved.)

Agati feels it is his duty to see Garnett fail while Smith wants  to see him succeed.  Everybody bumps heads in this low action drama.

The acting was good. I really wished they gave the characters a little more colorful  personality, as it was bordering on boring realism.  The film is nearly two hours long and the drama moves slow. Characters are built up and not read to you.  A well put together film that was too long and too slow for my taste.

6931190,1,B00RI4VBUO,Guy gets out of prison gets harassed by a cop. This has an underlying message that one who converts to Islam is always changed. There is a dangerous trend with conversions in prison. The Muslims target ones who want to get back at the system and they become radicalized.

Overall an engrossing movie even though I think most will dread how it is all going to end by the first 10 minutes of the movie...but very relate-able to real life and current events.

6931442,2,B00RI4VBUO,"Good Screenplay + Strong Cast + Iconic SW Location + An Obvious Displaced Academy Award Actor!

1. Forest Whitaker has created a legacy in films like Our Family Wedding, Phenomenon and Good Morning Vietnam. He has put in some amazing performances in the Butler, the Last King of Scotland (My Personal Favorite), Phone Booth and the Panic Room, but I found his acting in ""Two men"" quite difficult to believe. Anyway,

2. A Fish Out Of Water - First of all I AM from NM ... Taos to be exact, and NM is a Anglo-Hispanic-Native American stronghold Linguistically, Culturally and Historically. IMO, Forest was NOT to be the Obvious choice in the Primary Role for this interesting, little movie (not film).
An Afro-American actor, in a Men-In-Black Suit, struggling with Spanish, and his Islamic ""Conversion"", arrives back in Deming, NM? REALLY??
That would have been like Ben Affleck playing the Primary Role in ""The Last King of Scotland"" ... or Forest Whitaker as Forest Gump ...
there's an obvious cloud of Incongruity ... No Freaking Way, Jose!

Other obvious choices, IMO, would have been anyone of these guys: Adam Beach, or, Benicio Del Toro, or Taylor Lautner, or Esai Morales , or
Danny Trejo, or A younger version of Tommy Lee Jones,. But, perhaps, none were available??

The SUPPORT CAST ... are/were Perfect, which is the ONLY reason I don't give this movie ZERO Stars!

3. An obvious remake of the Jose Giovanni's French film made forty years ago,  ""Deux Hommes Dans La Ville"" was first a plea against death penalty. Sometimes ""remakes"" just don't work, especially, if the primary actor cannot save the movie, even if he throws himself under the chili cart
on the streets of Deming!

4. SKIP IT ... IT's A DUD! I want to remember Forest Whitaker, as ""The Last King of Scotland"" ... because it simply works Perfectly!

Anthony Quinn would have been PERFECTION for Two men!",1438992000,,1879,4.795665634674923

6931451,4,B00RI4VBUO,"There are so many times that I wish Amazon would let me give a half a star. This is one of them. 4 stars does not do this film justice. There is such a wide gulf between 80% and 90%. This film rates more than a 90 and it hurts to give it only 4 stars, yet 5 would mean it is perfect. I did not think it was perfect. There were times when the film merely told us what was happening rather than let the characters develop. The most notable was the relationship between William and Dolores. Because the film was so much about character development rather than action this felt awkward.

The film is somewhat slow but nice too look at and the character development was great fodder for thought most of the time. Because it is not a typical Hollywood film it probably will not be rated highly. However, it features great acting, fine cinematography, and generates honest emotions without resorting to black and white stereotypes. In other words it is reminiscent of how movies used to be made. There is a lot to reflect on here and I appreciate that. I also appreciate thta Keitel and Whitaker are two of the great actors of my lifetime.",1438992000,,1132,4.390476190476191

The emotions of the characters were accurately portrayed:  the Sheriff's desire for ""Justice"" over the death of his deputy and the criminal trying to do right after his parole.  The emphasis of the portrayal of the Muslim religion as peaceful was OK but too much time trying to convince me of this fact.  I know the Muslim religion is big in prisons so I felt that was again an accurate portrayal.
The story moved really slow I guess partially to show the passing of time and partially to begin identifying with the characters.  I wanted it to hurry up and get to the climax.
When it reached the climax and everything could be tied up the movie ended.  Left me with the feeling there should be more.  Another whole slow movie could be made about what happens next.",1437523200,,796,4.486111111111111

6931685,4,B00RI4VBUO,"I like Harvey Keitel.  He always plays interesting characters.  I'll tolerate Forest Whitaker.  Sometimes he's brilliant, other times he's a lunatic.  This movie, a remake of a 70s film, has him somewhere in the middle.  Whitaker plays a convict out on parole.  Keitel plays Sheriff Bill Agati whose deputy William Garrett (Whitaker) killed nearly 20 years early.  Agati doesn't want Garrett to forget.  Brenda Blethyn plays Parole Officer Emily Smith, the PO assigned to Garrett's release.  Reg E. Cathay plays Smith's boss.

A several have mentioned, this is a somewhat pointed movie.  Whitaker's character is a converted Muslim.  Much of this movie gives this a special significance and credence for a better beginning and life as if that in itself means total reform.

Luis Guzmn plays Terrance, a former player in Garrett's life.  Between the parole officer, sheriff and Terrance, life for Garrett is no bed of roses.

6931713,3,B00RI4VBUO,The movie was okay. I love Forest Whitaker (great actor). But I don't really understand how the title has anything to do with the movie. Harvey Keitel was to be harassing Whitaker because he was the law and Whitaker was a parolee.  (Didn't do much of that). Story line was not the greatest and plot was not all that interesting.,1431907200,,328,4.466666666666667
6931714,4,B00RI4VBUO,"I was prompted to get this because I recently saw Forest Whitaker play Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland"" -- an Oscar-winning performance there, and another very fine performance here.  It's something of an odd movie, made by a French director, Rachid Bouchareb, who is interested in the phenomenon of borders, and this movie is set in southern New Mexico, and while cross-border drug trading is certainly part of the environment, the focus here is mainly on the character William Garnett (Whitaker) who has served 18 years of a 21-year sentence for killing a sheriff's deputy at a time when he, William, was part of a drug gang run by Terence (Luis Guzman).  Now Garnett is out on parole, under the watchful but relatively benevolent eye of a parole officer, Emily Smith (Brenda Blethyn).  But other eyes are on him too -- his old gang-brother Terence wants to pull him back to be an enforcer on the Mexican side of the border, and the local sheriff, Bill Agati (Harvey Keitel), whose deputy Garnett killed, would like nothing better than to see Garnett slip up and be sent back to jail -- and Agati isn't above a degree of harassment, intended to trip Garnett into just such a slip.  Garnett's interest is in living a quiet life.  He has become a Muslim in prison and works hard at being devout.  He gets a job, low paying but honest, and a girl, an nice Mexican-American bank teller.  But as the movie goes on, the pressure builds on Garnett from both sides, so to speak, until an event takes place that compels him to take the kind of action he wanted to avoid.

This kind of story isn't unfamiliar -- the ex-con who wants to go straight but whose old associates keep trying to pull him back to a life of crime.  Here, the temptation is partly that the life of crime would get him much more than the pitiful wages he's able to earn as an ex-con looking for a ""straight"" job.  What's unusual and arresting is the way the film suggests the limited options for Garnett not just because of his past but because of the economic circumstances in the impoverished border county.  The camera, whether in the little town or in the desert frontera landscape, makes vividly clear the poverty of the options -- and the irony that Garnett, as a parolee, is not able to walk away from the place because of the terms of his parole.  So it's a movie about a trap, and the trap isn't just Garnett's character and past -- it's the whole constricted world of his release.  It obviously has struck some reviewers as too slow and downbeat, but the acting is good enough to hold one's attention for the course of this sad and sobering movie.  The ending, by purely pictorial means, raises poignantly and effectively the question of just what exactly Garnett's religious devotion has done for him.",1431475200,12,2783,4.562248995983936

This movie highlights the internal contradictions of the American system of criminal justice.

8695345,5,B00RI4VBUO,"Looking at these other reviews, I have to wonder if they viewed the same film I did...  This small film is outstanding in ALL WAYS.  Wow!  A command performance from Whitaker!  He is very skinny in this film with different hair, glasses and moves completely differently than any other film - at first I did not recognize him.  As the demon-filled all suffering ex-murderer/drug runner, his quivering open mouth and pained eyes denote the feat he feels just going through normal life ""stuff"" with hairy speed bumps...  Matching his burned-out soul is the desolate New Mex terrain and dusty cow lot and cell-like halfway house room.  Chilling.  His character attempts to go back to the same town where he committed a heinous murder (judging from his second murder it must have been brutal and revengeful...), get a job and gain the love of a woman.  He achieves these wants, but Keitel also feels outright revenge as the old sheriff who feels scorned by this convict who not only took away his deputy, but orphaned his two children and widowed his wife.  Keitel is superb as always with his twisted face and quick temper.  His disposition too matches the NM terrain and hopelessness of the town.  I especially liked the performance of Whitaker's parole officer.  Super!  She too lives out on the desolate prairie and she too has a tormented soul as she herds along her parolees with an asp and sidearm as her equalizers and threats.  The sets are wonderful, the script extremely well written.  I didn't mind the Mexican language throughout - if you were lost you weren't paying attention.  Guzman, as always, is especially menacing.  The ending was perfect.  Of course you KNOW what happened:  The convict went back to prison or was put to death (or killed by the drug cartel), his love is abandoned and the sheriff is glad with all results.  Great casting, great acting.  I watched it riveted.  Super sense of place.  Great look at the penal system and the parole system.  Revenge is the word of the day as you view this film.

8695348,2,B00RI4VBUO,"I am not sure what the message of this movie was, other than all men deserve a chance at redemption. I love Harvey Keitel but this was the wrong movie for him. Obviously a low budget film and the writing was marginal at best. Forest Whitaker did a good job but the character was so limited. The ending didn't make much sense.",1497744000,,325,4.258064516129032

8695351,1,B00RI4VBUO,A Serious flaw in this movie is there are many parts with discussions between two people and not just a few words needing translation since they are talking in Spanish. This is often through out the film. At first I had no problem because I could get the gist of what they were talking about but not exactly what was said. As the movie goes on this continues with longer discussions that seem to be an important part of the story but all a non Spanish speaking person can do is go on body language. Why no sub-titles? This was a major factor in my one star rating Plus the ending leaves majors questions and possibilites. Very Disappointed.,1495324800,2,640,4.432203389830509
