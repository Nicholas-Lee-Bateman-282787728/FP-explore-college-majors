I will make an exception for this ground breaking film where this technique, along with natural lighting and no soundtrack absolutely suits the content.  Anyone with a passing acquaintance with family incest (as well entrenched racism) will find this film revelatory.  I was amazed at the frankness, the honesty, the revealed hypocrisy and denial.  Hand held cameras make my stomach churn!  In this case one's stomach needs to be upset. Others have done a great job of marking this film as a must see, one of their favorites, the best film of the decade, etc.  I concur.  The only films I have seen that REMOTELY resemble this in emotional impact are NATURAL BORN KILLERS (the irony of the title is that killers are made, not born...see the dinner scene in this movie), and DJANGO which gave one the embarrasment of justice served. I have never seen acting like this!  Unbelievable.  Flawless.  As gruelling as this one is to watch I may have to buy it to view over and over as it has layers of sophistication.

1047446,3,6305495777,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The noted Danish director, Thomas Vinterberg, asks the question, 'is there nothing sacred?', and decidedly answers in the negative. Some may call 'The Celebration' a black comedy, which according to Wikipedia, fits the definition: ""In black humor, topics and events that are usually regarded as taboo...are treated in an unusually humorous or satirical manner while retaining their seriousness."" But the film also falls under the broader category of farce: ""a farce is a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable...Farce is also characterized by physical humor, the use of deliberate absurdity or nonsense, and broadly stylized performances...Furthermore, a farce is also often set in one particular location, where all events occur.""

If one accepts Eric Bentley's definition of farce where one is permitted the outrage without the consequences, then Vinterberg has broken the societal taboos of pedophilia by asking us (in effect) to consider that the consequences of such a transgression might not be as bad as one thinks. Indeed, when Christian spills the beans at his father's big birthday bash that he was molested by his father as a child, the outrage is certainly there for all to see-but the consequences are hardly what the viewer is expecting.

'The Celebration' reminds me of a much darker version of 'Seinfeld'. The four 'Seinfeld' buddies are deeply flawed human beings, but once they come across a much darker force (The 'Soup Nazi' as one of countless examples), they must prepare themselves to do 'battle'. The end result is that our 'heroes' may end up a bit 'bloodied', but their far more neurotic counterpart, must inevitably receive his/her comeuppance.

Hence, Helge's children, Christian, Michael and Helene, are cast as the protagonists, who inevitably must take their 'evil' father down. But along the way, they too, with their serious flaws, are exposed as pyrrhic victors.

Perhaps the most flawed of the three children is Michael. Immediately we see what a hothead he is when he kicks his wife and children out of the car, to give his brother a ride, driving up to the family-run hotel where the celebration will take place. Later, he flips out completely, berating his wife for forgetting to pack his favorite shoes, that he was planning to wear at the party. If there's one wrong note in the film, it's Vinterberg's decision to cast Michael as an out and out racist, after he sings a racist song, disparaging Helene's African-American boyhood. The whole idea here is to highlight the characters' limitations, not make them unsympathetic!

Vinterberg also hints that Helene has not lived up to her expectations. When she finds a suicide note belonging to Christian's twin sister, Lisa, who killed herself a couple of months before, she ineffectually hides it, afraid to reveal its contents to anyone. Helene's mother, Else, expresses her disappointment in her surviving daughter by alluding to her failed career choice as a singer and her flirtation with socialism. Else's racism is much more subtle when she claims Helene chose 'anthropology' over 'law' (a dig at Helene's black boyfriend).

And finally there's Christian, who Helge reveals during one of their 'one-on-one's', has a history of psychiatric problems and failures of relationships with women. While a victim of sexual abuse as a child, Christian can only ineffectually lash out at his parents in front of friends and family members. Even after his initial claim of abuse, he comes back for 'more', castigating his father again and then his mother, claiming she was a witness to Helge's pedophilia and did and said nothing. The whining Christian ends up being tied to a tree by Michael, as the younger son believes his mother's story that Christian is a teller of 'tall tales'.

Soon, however, the far more disturbed Helge gets his comeuppance. After the toastmaster reads Linda's suicide note (given to him by Helene at Christian's behest), the deceased daughter implies she was also molested by Helge (as part of a dream, she says). Helge finally owns up to his behavior, by outrageously stating that was all Christian ""was good for."" But instead of anyone calling the police, the consequences are minimal for the family patriarch. That evening Michael administers a non-lethal beating; in the morning he beats a hasty exit as Michael asks him to leave the breakfast area--with the further proviso that he will be not be seeing his grandchildren ever again.

As for Else, she declines to join her husband 'in exile'. Some internet posters have stated that she too deserved Helge's fate. But consider this: at the time the abuse occurred, what could she really have done? If she had went to the police, would anyone have believed her? Or if she tried to leave with the kids, what kind of financial support would she have had and wouldn't have Helge done everything in his power, to prevent her from taking the kids?

You may have noticed, of course, the low quality of the film's production. That's of course due to Vinterberg's allegiance to the Dogme 95 Collective school of filmmaking, which Vinterberg was one of the founding members. We all remember what this silly avant-garde movement was all about: no props, no music, a hand-held camera, filmed on location, director getting no credit, etc. In short, Dogme 95 was just another word for 'low-budget' and a well-meaning attempt by independent filmmakers to achieve parity with the big-budget studios.

Vinterberg's real achievement here is extending the genre of black comedy into a new realm. Taboos are refreshingly swept aside with a 'happy ending' (the antagonist is dealt with by his family not the police; facing ostracism instead of a criminal sentence). 'The Celebration' is not much of a 'laugh-out loud' spectacle but still manages to be fairly original.",1407110400,,5942,5.102880658436214

1047449,4,6305495777,"Truly, the only reason that I gave this picture 4 stars is that I don't like ""reading"" films, and since this is in Danish, I had to read it, which meant that I missed some of what was going on in the film visually.  Aside from that personal preference, this was an amazing film, set dead in the middle of a father's most scandalous behavior and his wife's knowledge about it.  One of their children finally decides to out the entire story during his father's birthday celebration.  I was shocked at the reactions of the other guests to the information revealed by the protagonist of the story, something that should have landed his father and mother both in jail, and these days, would.  If you've a squeamish stomach or can't take social realities, don't watch this, but if you can face reality and praise the person who overcomes a great deal of hardship, this film is fantastic.

1047452,5,6305495777,"Festen or The Celebration is first off about a subject you wouldn't expect to see made in Hollywood, for more than one reason. As you watch, it becomes physically sickening to see how many people can be in denial about something in front of them. Here, pretty much the entire family refuses to see that the father, Helge (Henning Moritzen), is a dangerous individual who raped his children, making them into highly unstable adults. The lead character Christian, played by Ulrich Thomson, blamed himself, as is normally the case, and spent time for it in institutions. Just before Helge's celebrations, his daughter, Christian's twin sister had just killed herself, which brought suppressed memories back to the forefront for him, and his other sister, Helene, leading to his decision to out his father publicly.

The high class setting is suitable for showing the different reactions you would expect to see. However, these reactions would be similar pretty much in any sphere of society with different personalities stepping in to whitewash the crime in their own way. When one targets dirty crimes at a high level, many people, allies included, might arrive to make pleas to be more reasonable. There is much sanity at stake.

When Christian outs his father, he is attacked by his dolt of a brother, Michael, an open racist and wife abuser. The mother is a clueless socialite who was witness to the abuse, but chooses to dismiss her son's accusation as the product of a loser's imagination. The father does the same in private, suggesting that Christian is mentally ill. Helene tries her best to keep silent. As the other guests sit around the table, they look on, enjoying the scene, without any comprehension as to the seriousness of what they're hearing.

It takes awhile and an amount of repetition by Christian to get through to the disbelieving group. He reads part of the suicide note written by his twin sister. At this point Helge's wife and Helene start to break down, and he loses the support from his family which was essential to maintaining the facade of normality.

The Dogme film making style is well suited to this film, given the surreal and blunt nature of the subject. It is in a way like a documentary of Christian's anguish and the handheld camera's and plain lighting cuts through the glitz of the 'celebration'. The directing by Vinterberg is brilliant, as is Ulrich Thomsen's expressions as he plots his course. This film shows a level of reality that is far beyond what North American Reality TV or Brit/European Cannes critic crowd films are capable of.",1372723200,2,2582,4.8881278538812785

The first of the dogma 95 films, many people may critique the movement itself for its many times, amateurish, filmmaking strategies but what this movement touched on and what The Celebration illustrates beautifully is the power of acting and writing. This film makes me want to be a better screenwriter. With such a powerful story the antics that are so easily relied on in Hollywood today are completely unnecessary as you are too enthralled in the family drama, to care about special effects and CGI. That aside the filmmaking itself is breathtaking even more so when one considered the 10 commandments all dogma 95 films must adhere to.

1047517,4,6305495777,"The Celebration (1998) is a wacky and saddened Danish film that focuses on a satirical look at family and secrets.

Christian, with the most shocking news, has a twin sister who commited suicide, hence, clue number one.  Michael is a racist and fairly wacked out himself, and sister Helene brings her black boyfriend.  Nobody is sane in the family, nothing is normal.

From the minute the family arrives for the party, one gets an idea of what to expect with a severely dysfunctional and crazy family.  During the elaborate dinner party with numerous guests present, Christian drops a bombshell family ugly secret where father is the perpetrator.  But all is not over with this bombshell; the party goes on, craziness continues till another bombshell lands.

There isn't a dull moment in this film; it is faced paced, filled with dramatic events, startling revelations, sprinkle of violence, and partygoers everywhere.

One child is not present, it is Christian's twin sister who has committed suicide.

The party is in a remote estate or hotel, owned by Helge, who is proud of his success in live and his children.  However, Christian came with an axe to grind.  He toasts his father in front of the group with a gripping awful truth.  Everyone is stunned but as the movie progresses the power of truth overwhelms.

1047519,5,6305495777,"This is a drama done very much in a documentary style, similar to Grey Gardens. But this is a drama. You wouldn't know it from the style alone. This feature movie is very interesting because it follows the characters around a large estate house, and reveals their family dramas and one very heart wrenching truth. The cameras and lighting are not fancy, and everything is done naturally. There are no lighting tricks, filters, tripods, effects, FX and such. This movie is a part of the Danish Dogma School of film, which is a group of filmmakers that adhere to a strict code of conduct forbidding the use of Hollywood tricks.

The story alone is fetching. It hits home for so many nobles that try to keep the family facade, when things may be not so perfect. This is a tale of the complete crash of the stiff upper lip, and exposes the explosion of violence and emotion once that facade breaks down. It's about the measures a family will take to keep their image perfect. It will surprise you, and I was in anticipation through the movie. I didn't know who to believe until near the end!

The main character really puts up one heck of a fight.

Lars von Trier started the Dogma movement in order to get back to ""real cinema"".  As much as I admire Von Trier, this was a boneheaded move, as it forces undue restrictions on filmmakers.  There were only a handful of films that were released under this moniker.  Von Trier's The Idiots (the only film of his that was approved under Dogma rules), Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy (the most artistic of the bunch, and one that bent the Dogma rules a bit), and this film were the only 3, as far as I know.  This one is the most intense, as it is a party of a 60 year old man who is a financially successful businessman, but who also was a monster who molested his own children.  The film has sometimes been billed as a dark comedy, and there are a few moments where there is humour, but overall the film is very brooding, depressing, sad, and angry.  I think it was just portrayed as a ""comedy"" in this country because over the last decade or so everything we see has to be funny and light.  Heaven forbid we take anything seriously.

I saw this in a theater.  The digitial video detracted considerably from my enjoyment.  It wasn't shot on high definition, but the cheaper digital video, and when blown up to 35mm, it looked like garbage.

A lot of what makes this psychological study so successful is in Vinterberg's direction, which is mostly in accordance with the doctrines of Dogme 95 - a set of precepts for production laid down by Vinterberg and Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves) in which no tripod or dolly shots are allowed, and the film stock and lighting contribute to a shaky, naturalistic and documentary-style finished product.

This style serves to enhance the substance of the already substantial script, adding filmic flesh and muscle to a strong skeletal foundation.  And though the Dogme 95 rules are generally seen as being restrictive, in this movie they only serve to set the story free; the cinematography yields a result that is both starkly real and impressionistically atmospheric, which allows moods to merge, the normal and paranormal to fuse, and truth and metaphor to co-exist.

Whereas some more traditionally shot mood pieces have to bludgeon the viewer with obvious symbolic images to penetrate the narrative, here narrative and image collide to become the symbolism.  It is this clever trick that empowers the actions of the screenplay, making them much more than the sum of their parts.

There are some films that make it difficult to remerge with the everyday flow of the ""real"" world, because the reality created on the screen is so strong that it doesn't allow external constructs to filter through, even long after the credits have rolled.  The Celebration is just such a film.",1167436800,5,1825,5.080267558528428

The father of the honorable bourgeois family is turning 60. The relatives and adult children are coming from all over the country and abroad to celebrate his anniversary. Even a prodigal eldest son Christian arrives from Paris, and the family celebration begins. The refined wines and the specially prepared dishes are waiting for the guests to enjoy them. Christian pronounces the first toast and the guests' appetites are spoiled for a long time. Christian reveals that his father had sexually abused him and his twin sister, Linda in their childhood and he caused Linda's suicide two months before the celebration.

It is not the first time, the story of a respectable family with the dark secrets revealed during the family reunion was told but it is the first time it was told using ""Dogme-95"" rules: shaky, hand-held camera, natural lighting, and no special effects. Everything looks very ""not pretty"" that is required by the harrowing subject matter. Well written and acted.

1047642,5,6305495777,"FESTEN (The Celebration) as a title for this dark but brilliant film from Denmark 'assembled' by Thomas Vinterberg is more than the oxymoron that applies to the story at story's conclusion.  It is a powerful, immaculately acted and performed and photographed study on the level of the great Greek dramas, but placed oh so uncomfortably in modern times.

Helge Klingenfeldt-Hansen (Henning Moritzen) is the patriarch of a large family whose 60th birthday is cause for a huge celebration, a party in the wake of the latest subterranean dark secret of this ominous group - the suicide death of the eldest sister (Lene Laub Oksen - seen only as a spirit), twin of Christian (Ulrich Thomsen).  Christian returns to the party from his successful Parisian restaurant career bringing with him his history of multiple institutionalizations for 'mental illness'.  He is joined by his brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), a ne're do well owner of a sleazy grill in Copenhagen and married to Mette (Helle Dolleris) in a 'challenging' domestic life (!), and his lawyer sister Helene (Paprika Steen) who quite against family rules is living with a black man Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah).  The only calm one among this disparate group is the mother (Birthe Neumann).

Problems arise before the party begins, old sibling differences and family squabbles rising out of the cracks in the glorious old castle that houses the celebration.  But the clinker comes when Helge asks Christian to offer words at the feast, a task openly welcomed as it gives Christian the opportunity to flail out the truth about the Helge that everyone seems to admire but who in fact is the nidus for the dark submerged evils that permeate the family.  In the course of the celebration all of the family problems are revealed in a manner that is as stunning as the blackest of Greek tragedies.

The cast is extraordinary: every actor is gifted and performs difficult roles to perfection.  Outstanding among them are Ulrich Thomsen and Paprika Steen who give notice of great acting talents.  Much has been said about the manner in which the film was made according to Danish codes: suffice it to say the code's rules magnify the importance of this wholly successful film.  It is a must see experience.  Grady Harp, November 06",1164758400,6,2282,4.958005249343832

Wow, what a production, totally beleivable characters, but, what an awful family. That's how is is. I was enthralled by the performances, especially Christan. Was emotionally drained after it.",1163116800,2,357,4.95
1047644,4,6305495777,"Altman type films - huge cast, thrown together with a story and left to piecemeal the scenes together - are not my cup of tea.  Without really strong director in this improv-style, actors tend to make every scene filled with crisis to make their roles more ""interesting""for themselves, and their events more dramatic.  This film has a stronger script than others of this type, more shape, but still that feeling.  Too much  a rabbit warren of hystrionics.

  The strongest performance is that of nordicly handsome Ulrich Thomson as Christian, a man coming home to a huge family reunion/birthday party to confront his famous patriarch about childhood incest.  The family history unfolds mainly around the dinner table in ""toastmaster"" style speaches.  This is all set up well.  Thomson, having the most devasting role, gives the most understated performance, and we are drawn to his detatchment.

  The truthfullness of the movie is that everyone is so anxious to punish the victim for speaking out... and the history that unfolds of the treatment the victim has repeatedly received, again, for having been a victim.  It is the great kernal of the story here that makes this movie rise above its style and plot elements.

  A big problem is the huge cast of people who seem completely unconnected at the dinner party.  They seem to have no feelings for the situation, the individuals, and that is a script and a directoral problem.  The cast could have been cut in half, it still would have been large enough to give a sense of society, but it would have worked better.  I also felt there were casting problems throughout, the mother gives a wonderful patrician performance, but she does not look like any of the children in any way.

  The overall problem is that the writer seems to be young, demanding very adolescent behavior from almost every character, which gets wearing and makes everyone a bit less interesting.

  All that said, I agree that this is a director who will be interesting to watch, and so much of this is very skillfully done, it is akin to watching a really marvelous class project - tremendous potential, as the director was clearly setting challenges for himself even beyond the restrictions of the festival.

  Being a Danish film, only the art house crowd in other countries is likely to see this, and if you are one of those folks - as I am - it is interesting to watch, and well done.",1139270400,,2413,4.760869565217392

I would imagine many people would tune out early unwilling to put up with that. The male characters are as sharply drawn as any in film, however, I had great trouble telling the female characters apart. It is not at all like a typical Hollywood film where you understand every word of dialog and its significance, and you get every joke. There is lots to offend anyone the least prudish in any sense.

1047682,4,6305495777,"I hadn't seen any Dogme 95 films until quite recently.  I did have a passing familiarity with the tenets of the group--which got a fair amount of press due to the emergence of Lars von Trier as a director of note--but hadn't actually gotten around to viewing any of the releases available in this country until just a few months ago.

A lot of what I had read was pretty negative.  Many reviewers found that the strictures under which Dogme 95 filmmakers operate were more limiting than liberating--and that even when the script and the acting were good, those strictures (particularly the grainy cinematography and lack of edits) often undermined the films' effectiveness.

Since the first Dogme film I actually saw was ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS, I found myself in tentative agreement with the critics.  That film, a comedy-drama, seemed to beg for better lighting, better sound and an overall more professional look.  I remember thinking that the film's generally washed-out look  made one actress's bright red hair look oddly artificial).  It seemed oddly jarring that what was ultimately a bright, warmhearted film was presented so starkly.

But I have to admit the experience had its effect.  The next few films I watched I saw through somewhat different eyes.  I became increasingly aware of the kind of tricks filmmakers employ--particularly in terms of cinematography.  There are certain visual conventions in films, particularly in American films, that have become cliched and deserve to be challenged.

It remained to be seen how effective the Dogme 95 approach might be in a more dramatic context.  The very first entry in the series Thomas Vinterberg's CELEBRATION (am I even allowed to mention the director's name?) seemed promising on that score. The film concerns the secrets and lies of a well-to-do Danish family (which include incest, denial and suicide) set against the backdrop of the 60th birthday celebration of the family patriarch (and perpetrator).

We've seen this kind of set-up before, and it can go one of two ways.  It can be as emotionally shattering as the subject matter would seem to warrant--or it can ring totally false and shift to unintentional self-parody.  Thankfully, THE CELEBRATION manages to pull it off, and, yes, it's in part due to solid writing and acting, but I think the minimalist Dogme approach serves this vehicle well.  The film evokes Bergman--without the cinematography of a Sven Nykvist.  As it turns out, it actually works.  Powerfully.

Bergman is, of course, Bergman, and he would likely never have never have submitted to Dogme 95-like tenets.  On the other hand, he has approached same on occasion (SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE comes to mind), and a Dogme remake of any number of his films would be at least possible.

CELEBRATION is a difficult film to watch, and the lack of cinematic trickery adds to the discomfort in a very real way.  You can't really get away from the events unfolding onscreen, even momentarily, by pulling back and saying, ""Yes, it's painful, but look how beautifully it's framed.""",1093651200,18,3058,5.033797216699801

1047684,5,6305495777,"To start, let me just say that this is an amazing film!  The Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity is one heck of a way to make a film and the director really made the vow work for him to express his point of view.  Coincidentally, that point of view would be that the upper classes of the class system are certainly not all that they appear to be, and more often than not it is the supposed lower classes that have the true humanity between the two.

  To illustrate this point, Vinterberg used a plot that was very rich in emotional value and very probable in its theme.  The character development is surprisingly thorough despite the number of characters to develop.  A little goes a long way in this film and this is a credit to the writing of the film.  The plot developments were kept subtle yet certain and this allowed the film to move with a flowing, definite grace.

  Adding to this was the fantastic cinematography.  I believe that the aspect of realism within this film is due mostly in part to the cinematic devices used and imposed by the Dogma credo.  These devices include the jumpy, unstable camera movements which make the film seem as though one were watching a home video of some dysfunctional family gathering.  Through the use of hand-held cameras and various camera angles, the viewer is allowed to become one with the story and the action.  Instead of the fourth-wall view one usually expects, we are trust right into the middle of things as if we were a guest ourselves.

  Natural lighting is also used to great effect as it evokes feeling of hope and despair in the viewer along with the characters.  I thought at first that the lighting (particularly at night) would make the difficult to follow but it proved only to heighten the sense of loss and confusion induced by the plot.  As to the editing of the film, I think I would require a second or third viewing in order to place the exact effects of the editing technique. However, I have no doubt that it served its purpose well.

  In all, I'd have to say that this film is one that will stay in my mind for years to come.  It is not only the original filmmaking technique of the Dogma manifesto which produces this lasting effect.  It is the way in which the vow was blended with a storyline so moving that it causes the film to burn its message into the heart of a viewer.",1091664000,4,2343,4.405594405594406

However, the party continues as if nothing ever happened, but someone is determined to spoil the party with the truth.

Celebration is a well-planned and remarkable film as it is shot after the guidelines of Dogme 95, which produces an authentic atmosphere as the camera is handheld and shot with no extra lightening.  The realistic atmosphere that is set in the film enhances the disturbing elements of the story, and makes it almost comfortable to watch.

THE 10 RULES OF DOGME 95

1.  Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).

2.  The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot).

3.  The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted. (The film must not take place where the camera is standing; shooting must take place where the film takes place).

4.  The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera).

5.  Optical work and filters are forbidden.

6.  The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)

7.  Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now.)

8.  Genre movies are not acceptable.

9.  The film format must be Academy 35mm.

10.  The director must not be credited.",1091404800,8,2386,4.739659367396594
1047687,5,6305495777,"Thomas Vinterberg's Celebration is without question one of the best of the Danish Dogme (spelled this way in Denmark, not Dogma) 95 films.
As the film opens, we see various people, in groups of two, three, and more, converge on a large house--walking, driving, and bicycling.  They are gathering to celebrate the 60th birthday of the man who fathered four children--they who have now come to pay their respects with their wives, husbands, boyfriends and girlfriends.  The man has made a tidy sum thanks to his unnamed business, and he and his wife live quite comfortably.  Also invited are the older couple's friends, and by the time everyone has arrived, there is a full house indeed, all seated at the host's large dinner table.
Speeches are made, glasses are chinked together in toasts, food is eaten.  The daughter has a black American boyfriend and it's a wicked foreshadowing that has him insulted by one of his girlfriend's brothers--an out and out racist remark.
This sets the stage for a shocking turn of events when one of the man's sons stands and proposes a toast to his father that leaves the guests completely stunned.  A dark secret is revealed that is so out of place with the reason for the ""celebration"", nothing can ever be the same following the younger man's toast.
The drama here is powerful, intense, seething.  One of the trademark strengths of Dogme 95 cinema, as many of us know by now, is its focus on story alone, without reliance on any special effects--CGI, lighting, or otherwise--and Vinterberg has here wisely chosen a story so strong that to ""enhance"" it with anything remotely resembling special effects would be doing it a major disservice--would be, in fact, blatantly stupid.
This is one of the best Danish films of the 20th century and should absolutely not be missed.

It was signed by several Danish filmmakers including Thomas Vintenberger, the director of ""Celebration"". The rules include using only hand held cameras, no artificial lighting, no props except those found on location. Dogma 95 is an attempt to get away from the artificiality of Hollywood-style movie making, but, in its own way, it's artificial itself because it works only with certain kinds of movies. ""The Celebration"", though, happens to fit perfectly into its rules. The hand held camera work, for example, only adds to the tension of this powerful and devastating film.
A large family gathers to celebrate the 60th birthday of its patriarch. Among the celebrants are the man's grown children, a daughter and two sons. A fourth child, a twin of one son, recently killed herself in the family's country inn where the party takes place. One son, Michael [Thomas Bo Larson], is a loud and pushy guy who drinks a lot and is less than an understanding husband and father. Helene [Paprika Steen], the daughter, is an anthropologist who has traveled the world. We find out that she has good reason to distance herself from the family. Christian [Ulrich Thomson], the twin, is a man who has been in a mental institution more than once. For a time, the children try their best to put on a cheerful front. But there is a dark family secret which is about to come out. It will destroy the family.
Despairing as it may be, this is one of the most riveting films I have seen in a long time. The acting is absolutely wonderful. The script is brilliant and brutally frank. Rarely have I seen a movie with so much insightful into the enormous complexities of relationships within a family. While your family hopefully does not have secrets this shocking, you should still be able to relate to the emotions involved.
This is the kind of movie you have to pay close attention to. In particular, pay attention to a small piece of paper that keeps cropping up.

Picture the scene:  all the guests and the wait staff in black tie, french-style table service, everyone at their best behavior...that is except Christian who has chosen this auspicious occasion to unmask his father as a fraud and a sexual predator.
Bear in mind that this is deadly serious stuff but the director Thomas Vinterberg, has seen fit to add extraordinary touches of the Absurd: the guests naturally dumfounded  at these revelations searching for the proper manner in which to contort their faces,place their hands, avert their eyes, look for the exit door, the mother's (Birtha Neumann)frozen smile, the kitchen staff watching everything on closed-circuit TV, commenting as if they were watching an episode of ""Dallas.""
""The Celebration"" is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the code of secrecy and silence that can forever stain and cripple the core of a family: don't say anything that might upset your mother or father or sister, etc, don't say anything because the neighbors might find out, don't go out of the family circle...or else.
This worked very well for this family for thirty years...the father, in particular, of course.

It is also true that the actors being unknown for the large majority of audiences around the world gives more credibility to the family and you totally forget that you have actors in front of you.
Vinterberg is extremely intelligent as a director, making the most of the Dogma style where no artificial light can be used, no music (unless played by caracters), no camera fixations allowed... He reminds every director that one can deliver a lot with simple things ...if well thought of. Here lies the difficulty to use all the chaotic and imperfect image,given by the Dogma style, to serve the movie and of course its subject.
In "" the Celebration"" you can't keep watching in a very sadistic and ""voyeuristic"" way but you can't avoid feeling guilty somehow for having enjoyed a very disturbing and shocking movie. Vinterberg was wise enough not to let this powerful and emotional family reunion drive the actors to overact and loose all the credibility of the movie The way a birthday celebration can turn into a family crisis and catastrophy reminds us all about some confrontations_ on a minor scale of course_ that could happen often in family gatherings.

1047754,4,6305495777,"Emotionally draining movie...I felt winded after watching the Celebration because the director grabs your attention and then runs you through an emotional tenderizer.  He's clearly not afraid to tackle tough subjects.
It's refreshing to see such a well crafted, intelligently acted, and unflinching look at family dysfunction.  (And you thought that ""Ordinary People"" was tough to watch!) The director does a good job of not glorifying the dysfunction - the movie is centered on the reactions and the relationship between father/son, between brothers, brother/sister, wife/husband, etc..., more than focused on the dysfunction itself.
The only negative thing about this movie was the lighting.  I don't care what the ""Dogma"" group says, bad lighting is bad lighting.  Because this movie was shot with a handheld and subsequently transferred to 35mm film, a lot of the lighting is so bad that the film appears very grainy - and not the cool, artsy, atmospheric graininess of ""Eraserhead"" but just grainy.  Maybe he was going for the home-movie look, but hard on the eyes nonetheless.
Be warned, this is not the colorful, bad-sweater-wearing Cosby family with stern after-school-special toned messages about ""say no to drugs/stay in school"" family dysfunction... This is an intense, squirm-inducing, double-barrelled look at difficult family relationships.",1007510400,7,1354,5.553398058252427
1047755,5,6305495777,"This movie is so incredible, it's not a suspense film but I was on the edge of my seat the entire time in anticipation. It's referred to as a satire usually, and I've heard people claim they found it incredibly hilarious, but I think any comedic angle really gets lost in the translation. I saw it as an incredibly gripping drama, and it works beautifully.
The whole point of Dogma was more or less to artificially force a filmmaker into concentrating on the substance of a film rather than the flash. If you rent or buy this flik you need to forget the whole Dogma aspect- don't view this film as some sort of ""cult"" film or an artistic excercise, that goes against the point of the Dogma project. Just view it as a story and you'll be amazed at just how intense, layered, and completely realized it is. It's really a fantastic film, just an incredible script, great direction, and great acting.
This film is not a great ""Dogma"" film, it's not a great ""cult"" film, and it's not a great ""DV"" (digital video) film, it's just simply a great film. It wouldn't matter if it had been shot in IMAX, it'd still be great. The fact that it was shot with a prosumer DV camera, and no professional lighting, just shows you how it's all about the substance, not who is in it or how much money was poured into it. Watch this film- it'll show you just how good a film can be, and just how awful your average Hollywood flik is.",1005264000,4,1412,4.332075471698113

1047809,5,6305495777,"Wow.
I'll conclude early on: This movie is GOOD.  VERY VERY GOOD.
Now that I've come to THAT conclusion, let me begin with the fact that I was rather hesitant on seeing a Dogme film since Lars Von Trier's Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, although I found them to be good films, bored the ... out of me.  BUT!  It seems our friend Thomas Vinterberg... likes to spice up his projects.
This movie is provocative, experimental.  It takes no recessions in terms of a storyline, which gives us a knacking good time in its jarring innovation.  I suppose part of that innovation is the level of shock that the movie contains, but also part of that innovation is the amount of HUMOR this movie approaches taboo subjects as sexual abuse (and even racial discrimination).
If you want to be entertained, feel artsy but at the same time, not be bored or feel horribly confused due to ""ingenius"" incoherency, this film is it.",978393600,5,921,4.557575757575758
1047810,4,6305495777,"Forget any of the stuff you have heard or read about Dogma.  This is a really good MOVIE.  The Celebration takes place at a mannor home where a family is gatherering for their father's 60th birthday.  Basically the whole family has showed up, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, etc.  The audience quickly learns that one member of the family is missing from an untimely death It is clear her death has shaken the family.  When they are assembled for dinner the eldest son, Christian, makes a speech in front of the whole family revealing why his sister has taken her life.  At this point in the film it is impossible to see this coming and it is quite shocking.  As the film continues one outragious speech after another takes place as the party continues. It is enormously entertaining.
This film has a great story and is very well acted.  It is fresh and original.  Many Americans do not get exposed to films such as this one and that is a shame.  Indeed the Dogma movement is very different.  It is certainly not Conventional Hollywood Cinema and that is part of the reason it is so much fun to watch.  People shold see this movie, inparticular fans of character driven plots and people who are not affraid to squirm.",975888000,11,1223,4.585253456221198
1047811,5,6305495777,"Festen(The Celebration), is an incredible film, but I do not think it has the ability to move mountains, like previous reviews have illustrated, and its cover is a little dissapointing. It's cover is a real contrast to what beauty lies in the cinematography.
 Festen, a Danish film with very independent-style  cinema is set at the summer villa of a true Danish Tycoon that likes to party with his equally rich and racist friends. But this celebration is different. This time it is old Papa's 60th Birthday, and all of his troubled children are coming to their childhood home for the occassion, in the wake of their Sister's suicide. Everything goes swell, we are hinted of some trouble, in a brilliant little pre-climactic series of scenes, but it is mostly smooth sailing until their quiet, deeply depressed eldest son, Christian, drops the bomb in a speech that is disguised as a toast to his father. Daddy has been a little deviant with his kids in the past, Christian says in his toast. It is not taken seriously by the aristocrats at first, but the rest of the film is focused around everyone trying to shut him up and cover up the truth, but Christian keeps on disrupting the increasingly shaky celebration, until his enraged, psychotic brother ties him to a tree, in the depths of their estate. Christian escapes, and retrieves a suicide note written by his sister explaining the whole abusive mess of their childhood. It is read at the table, in front of everyone, by his sister.
The Celebration(Festen) is incredible for what shows on your screen. It is not a Bible. It is just a quirky, however brilliant, little film by a master director. It is a simple thing, one flavour, and it should not be so over-interpreted. It is an artful, suprising film that you will enjoy thoroughly.",974592000,4,1791,4.755627009646302

1047813,5,6305495777,"Though I can't deny that I would prefer film over video any day, this is one of those films that proves that digital video can be used to make a  great movie.  Since the story revolves around a family reunion of sorts,  the idea of the movie almost being a home video of the events that take  place, works to the movies advantage.  In brief, the story unfolds when  having gathered everyone at the supper table, the eldest brother of the  family reveals a secret that leaves all in attendance aghast.  From there,  it only grows increasingly absurd as guest get up to leave in an uproar  only to sit down again, only to get up in an uproar again.  One of the more  appallingly humorous characters is the younger brother of the family who  makes his wife and kids get out and walk so he and his older brother can  talk.  Or another scene, where he gets the guests of the party to sing  racist songs in Danish so his older sister's African American boyfriend  can't understand them.  Sounds awful, but it is funny.  There's also  something haunting about the film, enhanced by the night time scenes, which  look great on video.",968025600,6,1125,4.443349753694581

""Festen (The Celebration)"" is a powerful  movie. I understand how much pressure the main character must have had when  he had his speech during the party. And how much emotions poured out when  he did that. What is so shocking with the movie is that there is secret  being told. A secret that hardly no one knew a the party. And how brave  Christian was when he revealed the big secret.
