7545521,5,B018ELUD1C,"I was lucky enough to see this in the Columbus, Ohio premiere last summer and I loved it!!  It's a very well acted and directed sci-fi flick with a timeless message about technology, very entertaining, and nicely paced. Also, loved the mid-century setting. Our entire family loved it.",1448409600,5,284,4.916666666666667

7545523,4,B018ELUD1C,"The movie had all the elements of a 50's sci-fy except for the radial tires on the pick-up. Being old timer now, it reminded me of my past childhood when I would go to the Saturday Matinee for kids starting at noon, where for a quarter admission price I would watch a movie like this (loved sci-fi and monsters) plus five cartoons and the weekly serial like The Three Stooges, or Abbott and Costello, Dick Tracy, The Lone Ranger, or flash Gordon, all of which would keep me coming back week after week...Ah, memories! I don't think the present generation can appreciate this movie like I can...Well done!",1515628800,,604,4.601851851851852

7545527,1,B018ELUD1C,"This movie was pathetic.  I was hoping for a tongue-in-cheek B movie spoof, like ""Sharknado"" or ""Lavalantula"".  They Came from the Ether"" was not funny, intentionally or otherwise.  The characters were wooden.  The writing was simplistic.  It was poorly paced.  There was very little in the way of scenery or props.  I don't know what the film makers had in mind, but this movie fails.  DO NOT waste your money.",1462320000,,411,4.771428571428571
7545528,4,B018ELUD1C,"'They Came From The Ether' is a 1950's tribute film. Just because of what it is I wanted to give it 5 stars. In reality I think it's somewhere around 3 1/2 stars but I gave it 4 because of the effort.
So why not 5 stars? I want to be clear here. I find no fault with the direction, acting, production values, etc. The problem that I had with this movie is with the plot. I felt it could have been better. I felt a few scenes went too long and that there were a few slow parts.

The movie has a few 'B' movie acting veterans in Judith O'Dea (Night of the Living Dead) and Linnea Quigley (Return of the Living Dead). Everybody here seems to know his/her part and what the film is supposed to be.

I've been wishing that some director would make a serious 1950's movie. While this movie is not really serious, it is far more serious than the movies by Christopher Mihm (which I love!). This movie is somewhere in between serious and parody. There aren't many scenes where you can say, ""that comes from (fill in the blank)."" It's just sort of it's own story done in the style of 1950's sci-fi. It never really seems serious but there really aren't any scenes where you laugh out loud either.

In any event, no matter my minor complaints, I will purchase any other films like this made in the future.

Recommended for all 1950's sci-fi fans.",1461628800,4,1336,4.2687747035573125
7545529,4,B018ELUD1C,"You ever had one of those experiences in life that you realized a job is not quite for you. Well, John Henry going door to door selling vacuum cleaners may be that candidate. The film opens with him unsuccessfully trying to sell a vacuum cleaner, when his life will be forever changed when he sees something in the sky that he is not quite sure what it truly is. He goes home to tell his wife, but she is packing up and wanting to leave because he cannot support her. As he is trying to tell her, she is not listening but he knows what he saw in the sky is something that could really change his fortunes. An alien visitor wants to trade technology for human experimentation. John sees his future in this and he decides to help thus opens a doorway for the aliens to try and control the human race. With Detective Mike Washburn on the case of some missing people, hopefully he can try and fix this issue. This film is a welcome throwback to the 1950s. From the set designs to the black and white, this film is just a fun little cheap gem to really get behind. The acting in this film is amazingly fun, the people in this cast you can tell really were so passionate and wanted to really transport people back to the early days of Roger Corman. The film has a sense of humor without being dumb or insulting to the viewer. The humor is smart and clever, there are situations in this film that are not meant to be humorous but came across smirk worthy to laughter. Where most films try to hard, this film feels like it was very comfortable in its own skin.

The positives to me are: this film is a fun cheese ode to 50s science fiction. This film gets almost every detail spot on. This film does not take itself too serious, it wants the viewer to have fun thus provides such a fun little vibe to it. The negatives, I felt this film may have been a tad too long. Some of the dialogue does come across as a bit repetitive and at times formulaic. Which again, this is a small production and those things are to be expected. I feel those negatives to the side for the minute, this film does offer a very fun family friendly film that showcases a golden age of cinema that at times is often duplicated, but never replicated like this film does. There is so much passion involved in this production that it is hard not to really cheer this film on. What a fun blast from a very fun past.",1457827200,7,2378,4.2263736263736265
7545530,5,B018ELUD1C,Loved this movie. I am not a fan of Sci-fi films but this one was different.  Job well done.,1457481600,3,92,3.8421052631578947
7545531,4,B018ELUD1C,Awesome throwback to the sci-fi films of the fifties. Great costumes and props. If you liked the original The Day the Earth Stood Still or Teenagers from Outer Space you'll enjoy this film.,1455148800,5,189,4.757575757575758
8742170,3,B018ELUD1C,"This is a bit of a contemporary parody on the 50s and early 60s ""Twilight Zone"".  It's acting and special effects are deliberately intended to be poor or corny.  Many of the props are either too old or too new for the time setting. All that understood it is of moderate entertainment value.",1517961600,,290,4.452830188679245
8742171,1,B018ELUD1C,Couldn't make it more than 10 minutes and only watched it for 10 because I thought they had to be kidding and the real movie would start any minute.  It didn't.  Makes you wonder why anyone would produce or act in this thing.,1517356800,,225,4.209302325581396

8742174,5,B018ELUD1C,"Why do I love this movie?  The minimalistic style transported me back to the time I was a kid and we would create stories and plots out of thin air with whatever props we had.  The fact that half way through the movie I fully accepted that the shed was a space ship was the sign for me that the producer and director were - very successfully - pulling us back to the days of our childhood.  Enough said.  Also - look for all of the ""easter eggs"" the next time you watch this.",1516752000,,475,4.0212765957446805

8742176,4,B018ELUD1C,"The acting is just awful. I seriously wonder if the actors were trying to be as bad as possible or if they really just were that amateurish. But somehow this kind of worked for me. It's a very shoe string budget independent modern version of a 50's Sci Fi. The music is actually pretty good and the sets and special effects, given this looks like it was done on someone's home computer, are creative and the story moves along and keeps you interested. Also, they don't just camp it up and smirk into the camera, they play is straight which I think was not the way a movie like this would typically go but again it kind of worked. But keep your expectations low and save this for when you are in the mood for something off beat to watch.",1516147200,2,736,4.264285714285714

8742179,1,B018ELUD1C,I am stunned anyone gave this more than two stars.  I couldn't get past the first five minutes.  It's a toss-up which is worse - the writing or the acting.  This is a total waste of time.,1515888000,,187,4.0
