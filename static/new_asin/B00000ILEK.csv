8378451,4,B00000ILEK,"This low-budget, independent effort filmed on location in New York City is well worth viewing both as a story of Greek-American (and Immigrant American) life and as a vivid visual time capsule of the city in the late 1950s.  It has held up well over the decades and suffers from few of mainstrean Hollywood films' conventional trappings and artificial devices. Nothing phony or contrived.  It tells a straightforward, believable story of the clash between old world and new world values through the actions of a young man from the Greek Highlands coming to the new world solely to avenge harm done to his sister's honor. The two leads, Athan Karras and Jeanne Jerrems, are very effective and convincing, and the late Karras' skills as a professional dancer and (later) instructor are used advantageously in the film.  Although the acting by some of the other cast is uneven and the dialogue a bit stiff in places, in my experience it mimics many of the more restrained conversations held by European-American immigrants in the presence of strangers. Once that minor limitation is accepted, the rest of the film works exceptionally well. Realistic, well-filmed scenes on the merchant vessel, at the Greek diner, at the evening family dinner, on the apartment roof, at the Sunday social at the house, at the night-spot, and at the Orthodox church were, in my view, essentially as they would have been in real life.  I felt like I was there; it is as I remembered such situations from youth.  There was an appropriate mix of impending Greek tragedy, ongoing drama and well-placed, realistic humor. The film's directors showed patience; the pacing is right as it should be, and the tasteful Laurence Rosenthal score is also a very good asset.  This little, largely-ignored film never tried to be more than it was, never played up to the audience, and the subtle, well-crafted end product is a film I have viewed several times and enjoyed more with each viewing.  I place it well above many more illustrious, pompous, pretentious efforts made out in Hollywood. It is not a template movie; it is its own film with its own story and atmosphere.  Highly recommended.",1426118400,3,2158,4.90934065934066
