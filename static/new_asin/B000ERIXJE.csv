8277804,4,B000ERIXJE,"I really enjoyed the DVD. Wes gives a lot of great glipmes into his unique playing style that is truly ""soulful"" and deserving to study.  My only real complaint would be that the DVD doesn't take advantage of all that it could be by offering notation/tab via a booklet or with extra footage with tab/notation on screen so that the viewer can study exactly what he is playing.  Overall, a nice masters type class that gives any bass player, not just those who play in a worship setting, ideas on how to funk up you playing.",1275350400,,522,4.427083333333333
8277805,5,B000ERIXJE,"I've been playin bass for 5-6 years, and got into it the same way most people in church get into playing the bass... (Our worship team had too many guitarist and NO bass players, so I volunteered to learn and play) This DVD has been a God send.  I had been looking for a way to improve my style and technique for along time.  The DVD is like  90min long and packed with info.  He goes over many styles and gives tips for all.  You can watch the DVD straight thru or the DVD Menu sorts it by music genre or by song titles.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is on a worship team wants to play more than just root notes and simple runs and/or wants to improve technique.",1204588800,3,672,4.053030303030303
8277806,5,B000ERIXJE,This DVD is great for anyone who is wanting a new perspective on bass guitar playing.  I would highly recommend it.,1141516800,6,115,4.476190476190476
