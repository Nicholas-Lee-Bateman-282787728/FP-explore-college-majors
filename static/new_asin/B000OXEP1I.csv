He repeated his four main ideas numerous times and the whole dvd seems like an amatuer production. I bought Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn which included 3 dvds and hours of gorgeous video for the same price!  Unless the price comes way down, people will be disappointed. He had some great ideas and a lovely garden...he just needs a more professional production or a much more reasonable price.",1200009600,,551,4.612244897959184
8187324,5,B000OXEP1I,"This is an absolute must for any gardener - no matter what your preference or forte. Everyone has that shady area where nothing will grow. Be prepared to change your taste. When you see this video, you'll be planting trees, erecting break walls, building lath houses - anything to get more shade so you can begin your own relaxing retreat like Mr. Benner did. The bonus - very little maintainence! Every gardner, from expert to novice will benefit from this video, and learn how rewarding little to no sun can be!",1115510400,2,513,4.648351648351649
