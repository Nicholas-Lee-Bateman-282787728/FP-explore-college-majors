8715873,5,B00XH2RJ2U,This was  one of the best of about 35 Kdrama's we have seen. Jang Hyuk from Fated to Love You had my daughter and I laughing and crying. What a marvelous actor. They all were really. Wonderful period piece. Great the sword play. Chemistry great. Its one of our top ten. We recommend it if you are into the Korean dramas.,1445990400,,320,4.245901639344262
8715874,5,B00XH2RJ2U,"A thrilling story reasonably close to actual events in the first few decades of the Koryo period. Decent video quality, the occasional ad streams not seriously distracting. A fine Korean period drama, good characterisation, exciting right up to the end.",1442102400,,253,5.35
8715875,1,B00XH2RJ2U,"Love the series. Jang Hyuk is terrific as usual. I agree with another review that I do not think this is a legitimate copy.
My rating is for the copy not the story. I wrote that I need disc 2 replaced as it just stops near the end of one of the episodes.
Have not heard anything from them; very poor service! Make note of who is selling it so you do not have similar issues.",1439510400,,374,3.9342105263157894
8715876,3,B00XH2RJ2U,"The series is 5 Star: Jang Hyuk is fabulous. And the series is terrific. But for now try to catch it on Drama Fever or other streaming services until a better DVD is available in a few months. I have found if purchased too soon after airing in Korea, the DVDs are ""taken"" off the networks, sold cheaply, and have the very issues others here have noted. Wait a few months for professional, factory produced DVDs.  They will cost more, but well worth it.",1439424000,2,452,4.380952380952381
