403730,5,6301972732,"Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery star in one of the earliest great ""talkies"" entitled Min & Bill. Min (Marie Dressler) runs a waterfront hotel and saloon and she has a special although platonic bond with one of the people who rent a room there, the good natured but not very smart drunkard Bill (Wallace Beery).

The plot begins when we see that for many years Min has taken care of Nancy (Dorothy Jordan), a young girl who was essentially left on Min's doorstep when she was just a baby. Min cares deeply for Nancy and Bill too; despite her rough exterior Min has a heart of gold and good common sense. Unfortunately, trouble starts when the truant officer threatens to close down Min's hotel unless Min allows Nancy to go to school; and Min must agree to cooperate with the truant officer.

Eventually quite a few plot twists happen--I didn't find this movie slow despite what anybody else thought. Eventually Min sends Nancy to a fancy girl's school and Bill and Min continue to live their lives even though Min privately misses Nancy desperately.

Things get really rough when both Nancy and Nancy's mother Bella Pringle (Marjorie Rambeau) come back to Min's saloon and hotel for their own reasons. Will Bill and Min be able to keep the irresponsible Bella from finding out that Nancy is her real daughter? How would Nancy handle things if she knew that Bella was her mother? What happens between Min and Bella after Bella insists on sticking around and mooching off her daughter Nancy? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll have to watch the movie to fine out these answers.

The choreography didn't impress me very much; the scenes don't have any fancy footwork in them and I suspect that this could be because many of the cameras they used at the time could be difficult to move. The cinematography reflects good judgment in scenes including the speeding, out of control boat ride with Min and Nancy in the boat as well as the beautiful pictures of the bay where Min's hotel is located.

Overall, Min & Bill provides great entertainment. The plot moved along at a good pace and it held my attention rather well. Marie Dressler gives a stunning performance as Min; and Wallace Beery as Bill is every bit as good. I highly recommend this film for fans of early ""talkie"" movies that truly remain classic movies to this day.",1189123200,11,2326,4.6911764705882355
403731,3,6301972732,"Min and Bill is a legendary film of classic Hollywood; it captures wonderful screen performances by two of the most unattractive faces of the silver screen: Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery. This movie was incredibly popular when it was released and the two were paired up again due to their strong chemistry.

The story surrounds a poor innkeeper on the waterfront (Dressler) who takes care of a girl named Nancy (Dorothy Jordan) she accepts as her daughter. The two are not related; it is explained that the girl was left on the doorstep for Min to take care of. Bill (Beery) is a friend of the two, a drunkard but a kindhearted fisherman. When the girl's mother, a fallen woman, returns for her daughter, Min turns hostile toward Nancy and throws her out in order to protect her. The girl is deeply hurt and although she is able to rise above her social class, she always returns to Min, hoping to recieve the motherly love she needs.

This film has a fine cast who work very well together and with the material. However, the beginning of the film is rather dull, and although it is only about an hour long, the movie seems longer because of the opening. Also, it suffers from symptoms many early talkies do: slow pacing, stiff camerawork, and poor sound quality.",1146268800,,1266,4.622222222222222
403732,5,6301972732,"Min and Bill earns a 5 star rating with me because it is a very human story.
Here we see greed, desire, shame, and maternal love on display.  Min and Bill is a cinematic gem clerly toe to toe with Streetcar.
This movie is a ""must see"" for lovers of gutsy, character driven tragi-comedy.",994464000,11,286,4.296296296296297
403733,4,6301972732,"That was how MGM publicized Marie Dressler in the early thirties. This film is a prime example of just why Marie Dressler was the TOP star of the early thirties. A large, homely woman in her early sixties, she nevertheless had such a natural way of acting that she left audiences satisfied, mesmorized and wanting more. I thought her speaking voice was unforgettable. Unfortunately, many of her films aren't easily found and are rarely seen today. TUGBOAT ANNIE is on video, but her supposedly great sentimental flick entitled EMMA isn't yet. Min is a waterfront hag (or cow as she refers to herself) who, years ago took in a child left behind by a loose woman named Bella. Min gives the kid a place to live in exchange for work. Bella comes back years later to see Min and her daughter, who is grown up and engaged to be married to a young man with social position. Min knows Bella is only interested in getting herself some money out of the daughter she cares nothing for. There is a fight and Min, thinking of the girl's future happiness, kills Bella and goes to prison with a ""Stella Dallas"" smile on her face. The fight between Dressler and Beery is the film's highlight and it's a DOOZEY! Marjorie Rambeau is good as the seedy, trampy Bella, but Dorothy Jordan is rather saccharine in her playing of the waif. Other Dressler films which will hopefully make it to video someday are REDUCING, PROSPERITY and POLITICS - depression comedies Dressler made with her foil Polly Moran.",943833600,11,1483,4.642585551330798

7819211,5,6301972732,"I love Dressler/Berry movies, Min & Bill, TugBoat Annie... So I'm very pleased. It's an old movie so modern moral judgements don't apply. Have always loved Dressler's roles of a strong, wily, determined woman surviving in a mans world. Not one of the glamorous movies of the 1930s. Video quality was good...if you love old movies it's wonderful ;-)!",1490572800,,349,4.932203389830509

7819216,5,6301972732,"I love this movie.

In addition to Marie Dressler, world's most lovable steamroller, stay with it for Marjorie Rambeau's big scene. GREAT pre-code acting! ""Or I'll know the reason why...!"" -- one of those inexplicable lost figures of speech. ""He'll hear from he! -- or I'll know the reason why!""",1353974400,,295,4.9
7819217,5,6301972732,"The film which kicked off Marie Dressler's box office reign was this one, ""Min and Bill"" (1930). While Dressler was never a ""beauty""--except for deep inside--her looks worked in her favor, for she was a natural for juicy character roles like this one. Paired with Wallace Beery (they reunited in ""Tugboat Annie"" a few years later), these actors' leathery faces were perfect in displaying the joys & sorrows experienced by their characters. Min (Dressler) is a grizzled ol' gal who runs a harbor hotel; she hangs out with Bill (Beery), an amiable lug of a sea salt. She has raised a young woman--abandoned by her mother years earlier--since the girl was six months old. Then the worst happens---the drunken mom reappears, which threatens the girl's future. It's fascinating to watch Dressler throw caution to the wind in playing a salty woman who emotionally pushes this girl away; yet, you know she does this because she truly cares for her & wants the best for her.
There's touches of broad comedy (the runaway motor boat; the all-out fight she has upstairs with Beery) as well as plenty of deep drama; the scales tip toward character study.
Dressler really knew how to command a scene. All she had to do was use those penetrating eyes, a mirror for all the hardships Min has gone through.
The closing shot of Min being taken away by police is parallel to that wonderful moment at the end of Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights""---a wry smile spreads across her face; in it, hope & satisfaction.
A terrific Dressler vehicle; her Oscar nod was well worth it!",1348272000,5,1553,4.776951672862453
7819218,1,6301972732,"When I got around to watching it I found out it was a terrible print.  Many, many (dozens) frames stopped and had to be fast forwarded to restart film on many occasions; other wise you had to sit and wait for the movie to continue.  The many distractions ruined the movie for me.  Whatever process was used to copy this film was horrible.  I would have returned it within 30 days had I checked it sooner.",1281484800,3,404,4.276315789473684
7819219,5,6301972732,"What a delightful movie!  Marie Dressler certainly deserved her Oscar. While it was not the Great Depression escapist fare offered by Shirley Temple movies, Min and Bill likely offered hope to its audience: persistence and holding to one's principles go a long way to sustain the human spirit.",1258243200,2,293,5.104166666666667
