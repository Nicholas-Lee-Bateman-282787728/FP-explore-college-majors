7867382,4,6304296886,"My motivation for watching this splendid 1994 addition to The Learning Channel's (TLC) GREAT BOOKS series was largely to seek answers to two questions that I had about ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN (first published in 1884): 1) why did Mark Twain (pen name of Samuel Langhorne Clemens b. 1835, d. 1910) abruptly send Huck into the middle of a Hatfields and McCoys-style feud after the incident wherein the raft upon which he and Jim were riding was crushed by a steamboat during their flight down the Mississippi River AND markedly change the tone of the novel from that point on; and 2) why did Twain decide to tarnish the image of Tom (titular hero of THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER, first published in 1876) near the end of this sequel?  While no explanation was given for the latter, the former was revealed to have been the result of the Missouran's ""well of inspiration running dry"" halfway through the writing of the novel and then returning to the manuscript 2 years later, after having travelled the world and successfully toured on the lecture circuit.

This program, written by Dale Minor, also provides the answers to many other questions readers of this American classic have about it and its author and also examines what, for many, is the controversial issue of the suitability of HUCK FINN's place on the curricula of American schools given its portrayal of African-Americans and its liberal use of the ""N-word"".  As is the case with other GB offerings, the producers of this one utilize the available tv and film adaptations of the novel, tap the opinions of various Twain/Clemens scholars, and, as has become expected of a program about Twain, has a Twain impersonator (MacAvoy Layne) voicing the author's opinions, including that HUCK FINN was written for adults, not children.

And, while providing pretty much all one needs to know about the great 19th century satirist/humorist/writer insofar as it impacts on his masterpiece, the producers wisely do not delve TOO much into the character and life of Samuel Clemens, becuz - as I found to my dismay myself - the more one knows about him, the less one admires Clemens the man (for ex., he was so vainglorious that he strove to be the centre of attention at his own daughter's WEDDING - BTW, for those interested in learning more about Twian/Clemens, I suggest the MARK TWAIN: A FILM BY KEN BURNS PBS dvd - think it sells here on Amazon).

As this HUCK FINN VHS tape is included in the TLC GREAT BOOKS VHS 10 PACK (also for sale on Amazon), I highly recommend that those interested in the former buy the latter becuz anyone who sees this program will surely want to watch other GB installments.",1317600000,,2663,4.7678958785249455
