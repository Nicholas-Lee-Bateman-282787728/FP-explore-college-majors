2254310,5,B0007ZD6Z4,I love this series! I like how the epi's are divided into 2 parts. It certainly keeps me gagging for the conclusion of an epi. Casting has been done well as all characters seem to get on well on screen.,1453852800,,202,4.075
2254311,5,B0007ZD6Z4,I really liked Trevor Eves,1453507200,,26,4.4
2254312,5,B0007ZD6Z4,"I love all british mystery series, this one in particular !!!",1450742400,,61,4.636363636363637
2254313,5,B0007ZD6Z4,"This is a terrific series. Trevor Eve is the head of the cold case unit. He is mercurial, a diva, obnoxious, rude--he has a lot of flaws, to put it mildly. However, it works in law enforcement in London in his unit. There is a great tendency towards inertia in both the force and his unit. And he is anathema to inert employees. So his cold case detective get the job done. The cases are extremely well written and plotted. They are quite intricate but I never had any problem following any of them. One of the people in his department is an older woman who is the psychologist for the unit. Her input is particularly valuable and she is one of the few people who can make him see sense when he's about to lose it.  This is very riveting tv and was on the BBC for many seasons. Don't miss it.",1449273600,,792,4.176470588235294
2254314,4,B0007ZD6Z4,Wouldn't it be nice if they charged a dollar for these older shows instead of $1.99. A bit dated science but well developed plot. Interesting older police mystery.,1445904000,4,163,4.857142857142857
2254315,5,B0007ZD6Z4,"I'm fairly addicted to British television. Especially the mysteries/detective/crime shows. This is one of the best of the best of the best. Smart and well-paced with great acting, it's quick to suck you in emotionally. Try at least a couple of episodes to let the characters develop a bit. Full of strong female characters, too - fantastic!",1445644800,9,340,4.982456140350878
2254316,5,B0007ZD6Z4,"Brilliant series from UK. I'm now totally hooked on it and have the whole series and enjoy every one.  Good cast. even when some are replaced further along, the new ones soon blend in.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys good British crime drama.",1440720000,3,242,4.604651162790698

2254320,5,B0007ZD6Z4,Blows away American fluff crime dramas!!!,1472774400,,41,6.0
2254321,1,B0007ZD6Z4,If you can believe whatever you see you'll like this show.  It is so unrealistic it is laughable.  The victim does as she pleases in the first episode and the police follow along.  Right!,1466121600,2,187,4.4411764705882355
2254322,5,B0007ZD6Z4,I wish Prime included all seasons.  Excellent. I love Trevor Eve. Fabulous characters.,1463616000,,86,5.615384615384615

8054634,1,B0007ZD6Z4,"Lame. Good cast though, with the exception of the smug male lead whose idea of acting is shouting.  Tragic, given what good detective tele the Brits can make, that they fail so gloriously as well. Unrealistic hard to even imagine, let alone believe, plot lines. Bathos, not pathos.",1523318400,,281,4.854166666666667
8054635,5,B0007ZD6Z4,I loved it but the episodes became increasingly creepy. Had it progressed in creepiness I would have had to abandon it mid-season. But I could just handle what this dished out. I liked Trevor Eve and the others; how they related to one another.,1521676800,,244,4.568181818181818

8054642,3,B0007ZD6Z4,"A big disappointment. I expected much better considering the cast, prior ratings and amazon reviews. It was a big hit in England. I am a fan of British mysteries and crime dramas, but this series misses the mark in my opinion. I hated Cracker too, so be warned if you didn't care for that series. I've only watched one episode of season one but the writing was full of cliches, the lead actor is very a bully, angry and overacting.",1477872000,,431,4.4
8054643,5,B0007ZD6Z4,Sad they discontinued this show.  It's good,1477785600,,43,5.142857142857143
