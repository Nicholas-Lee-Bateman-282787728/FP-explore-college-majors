8414479,3,B00439N63W,"This was Norman Mailer's 1st novel about WWII. And a very good story about the realities of men in war. Being Ugly and brutal. Not only to the enemy, but to each other as well.
So I give director Raul Walsh high marks for his efforts. As well the screen writer Norman Mailer for his first foray into it.
But the foreign made DVD sucked big time! Why can't this excellent film be an American made release?
I've always hated buying foreign releases of American made movies. Either because they are out of print here. Or never were released on video to begin with!",1491004800,,561,4.403846153846154

8414483,2,B00439N63W,"It is amazing how much a screenwriter can alter the experience of a novel such as The Naked and the Dead, and still in good conscience call it by the same title.  Although the general outlines are there, the overall tenor of the novel is completely changed.  The lieutenant survives, for crying out loud! And he actually has a message for the general after the mission is completed.  I wanted this so badly I purchased a region-free DVD player so I could watch it; I wouldn't recommend that.",1397260800,3,491,4.556818181818182
8414484,3,B00439N63W,"I have seen the naked and the dead (les nus et les morts in french) when it was released originally and I have loved it. This edition in DVD is rather disappointing. First, there is no version with french sub-titles (only italian) and, more importantly, the video quality is rather poor. It looks like a (rather bad) copy of a VHS, the bad quality is particularly visible in some sequences. Fortunately, the english audio is acceptable. All the lovers of this excellent film by the well known director -Raoul Walsh- (one of the best film on the Pacific WWII history, from a very important book by Norman Mailer) hope that a new DVD edition from the original copy will be available soon.",1372118400,3,686,4.631147540983607

8414486,1,B00439N63W,"I purchased the region 2 of The Naked and the Dead and it is formatted in ""letterbox"" 2:35 x 1 not anamorphic widescreen 16 x 9.  I was very disappointed because I really like this movie and the region 2 I purchased is barely better then the DVD-R I recorded from a TCM broadcast.  This is such a good movie I hope a good quality DVD or better yet a BluRay version is finally released.",1313280000,9,385,4.12
8414487,4,B00439N63W,"It's 1943 WWII on an island in the South Pacific where a division of American marines under the command of a martinet of a General (Raymond Massey) is attempting to drive off the Japanese from the island. The General clashes with a Lieutenant (Cliff Robertson) on how the enlisted men are treated and the platoon's sadistic Sergeant (Aldo Ray) shows signs of being psychotic. Based on the best selling novel by Norman Mailer (his first novel) and directed by the Hollywood veteran Raoul Walsh, the first part of the film focuses on the conflict between the officers and enlisted men and the second part of the film becomes more of a typical WWII film as a small platoon attempts to reach a Japanese held mountain top. Walsh doesn't flinch from the brutalities of war, Ray's character collects gold teeth from dead Japanese and withholds information from his own troop to fulfill his agenda despite the danger to his men while the cruel Massey treats enlisted men like vermin with only the humanistic Robertson to offer some semblance of sanity. The portrayal of women comes off poorly with Barbara Nichols as Ray's adulterous trampy wife and Lili St. Cyr, perhaps the most famous stripper in the fifties, playing, what else, a stripper. Bernard Herrmann did the brassy and brooding score. With Richard Jaeckel, Joey Bishop, William Campbell, James Best, Jerry Paris and Robert Gist.

The good news is that the Italian DVD is transferred in the scope format (about 2.35). The bad news is that the transfer is very soft looking. Close ups are okay but long shots are soft to the point that faces are almost almost unrecognizable.",1292716800,15,1627,4.85251798561151
