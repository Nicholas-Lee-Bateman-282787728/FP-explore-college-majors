I know its not a classic for the world but it is to me. I love the little adventurous Scamper and Snowflake. Though they get into trouble quiet often, its awesome seeing them return home safely. I will watch this with my kids for years to come for sure.",1354838400,7,397,3.9135802469135803
8040687,2,B00069FL68,"purchase was fine - arrived by date promised and the product arrived in the condition described.  The reason for the low score is that the DVD was very poor quality - like playing a VHS tape on my 4K TV.  My first thought was that someone made this DVD by using a video recorder on a television playing a VHS tape.  It's probably not that - it's probably just VHS quality on a DVD.  Probably looks fine on a much smaller TV - on 75"" it's nearly unwatchable.",1485043200,,457,4.159090909090909
