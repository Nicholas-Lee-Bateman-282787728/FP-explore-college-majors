1333223,5,B00003UC8V,"Nude Yoga provides a good overview of basic yoga postures. I challenge anyone who hasn't studied yoga to execute the headstand with the form of the young lady in the dvd.  Because the asanas are being performed correctly, Nude Yoga is a good reference. Done without clothing, one can better see how the body works. As no serious student gawks at his teacher during a yoga class, don't look at the screen as you do your routine. I highly recommend Nude Yoga.  I don't know anything about Tai Chi. The girls in the dvd didn't seem to either. I'm baffled that they yoked these two programs together. They should have used Nude Cigar Smoking. Nude Yoga and Nude Cigar-Smoking would have  satisfied the Jekyll/Hyde in us.",1013904000,33,716,4.666666666666667
1333224,4,B00003UC8V,"I find this DVD to be very relaxing. The models are hot and very naked...which is why one would purchase this DVD to beging with. I am calm and at peace with the universe watching this. Freeze frame and zoom can give an extra kick, howerver it is not really necessary. Light a candle, smoke something, maybe illegal (I didn't say that) and enjoy. Shaving certain hair is so very proper. Go to sleep or wake up to this one and your dreams or your day will go a lot better.",985392000,7,471,4.186813186813187
1333225,1,B00003UC8V,"I live in Danville, CA, and have yet to find a local yoga class as stimulating as this video! I was once a fan of the RICHARD SIMMONS, sweating to the oldies, but this is much more relaxing and harmonious. I feel like this is the new new thing of the new new age! This is fun, really fun. Plus, everyone's NAKED. I mean, you can't get any more natural than that! I'd also like to mention, that in addition to hanging out at local coffee shops, I spend most of my free time researching things like YOGA, and SOUL  NUMBERS, as well as astrology and TAI CHI. But nothing has come close to satisfying my new age cravings like NUDE YOGA. Really, I would watch this tape even if I didn't do yoga!",980467200,6,690,4.149253731343284
1333226,4,B00003UC8V,I was tired of the same old fitness dvd's. Thought why not learn yoga in the buff? The simplicity and pace of this dvd helped me understand the various poses and positions. The female narrator has a great soothing voice. The attractive ladies are helpful and visually easy to follow in each yoga lesson. Some people may think this is a silly video. I found this approach to yoga professional and motivating. My husband seems to like it too. I'm glad we bought it.,977529600,,463,4.523809523809524
1333227,3,B00003UC8V,"Two separate fitness programs on this DVD. Yoga and Tai Chi. Very nice to learn this on my TV with seven buck naked ladies teaching these classes. They show the careful moves, positions and breathing techniques like the  sun salutation and the half spinal twist.  The yoga ladies are attractive,  skilled and limber.  The tai chi ladies are very lovely to view in motion,  but not as talented.  The music and voice narration is relaxing, soothing  and very informative even for new folks like me.  Not x rated but erotic to  see.  In my opinion, this production is just as good as any other yoga  fitness program.  Plus hey, their all fully nude.  Works for me.  Fun to  participate or just watch. Unlike with a vhs tape, these workouts  can be  further enjoyed with the DVD interactive menus and instant chapter access.  Cool way to  learn yoga.",959990400,26,846,4.63265306122449

1333254,1,B00003UC8V,"This is important because there is an expectation for the product. I was considering a pure look at yoga and Tai Chi. The first glimpse at fake large breast caused me to turn it off. My expectations were not met with this product. It is hard to think of a pure science of the body without the expectancy that the people would love their bodies enough not to appear to change them to impress the masses. For me the appearance of large fake breast stopped my look at this product. If they are not pure yoga practitioners, set above the norm, then this cannot be taken seriously, but more in a light porn category to me. This maybe an incorrect assumption but it does show that perception is directly tied to expectations.",1339113600,,719,4.454545454545454

1333257,4,B00003UC8V,"I bought the VHS tape of Nude Yoga in 1999, and that was my first introduction to yoga.  Since then I have started to take classes with yoga instructors, and I am very impressed with the selection of poses that were chosen for the video.  It is true that the women in the video have not all mastered the poses, and it's just wrong for the one woman to have socks on.  I'm also not real sure why the progam had to be nude.  A one piece leotard would have sufficed, and the video doesn't seem like it's trying to be sexy, so what was the point of the nudity?  ANyway, I have come to igonore the nudity and enjoy the poses.  There is a very good selection of basic and difficult poses (except that there are no warrior poses), and the narrator explains the benefits from the poses.  I really enjoy this program.",1225843200,,808,4.207792207792208

1333259,2,B00003UC8V,"This video was made about 10 years ago.  The models do not appear to be enthusiasts of either Tai Chi or Yoga, as none of the models seem to be instructor quality.  All the instruction is provided in VO.  The instructions do not give a complete routine or even provide transition for most of the moves.

Gets a 0 for instructional quality
Gets a 1 for production value
Gets a 1 for quality of intstructors/models
Gets a 1 for camera work
Gets a 4 for the concept.

With the popularity of these exercise methods growing, increased popularity in nude yoga specifically, I would think there is a great market for this video to be remade and remade properly.",1202515200,2,654,4.508474576271187

1333261,2,B00003UC8V,"It is totally nude and therefore has a lot of entertainment value.  I guess my biggest complaint (and I can really only comment on the yoga since I am not a regular tai chi practitioner) is that the women have fake breasts -- this is rather contrary to the overall yoga philosophy, is it not?!  I guess if they were real they'd bounce too much, but I thought it was inappropriate/ridiculous.  Also, they wear socks (not those funky special yoga socks, but just regular socks).  Socks are a big no no in yoga!  The women didn't otherwise appear to be cold, so why they were wearing the socks was a total mystery.  But the oddities also make this fun/funny to watch.",1178409600,7,664,4.446280991735537
1333262,2,B00003UC8V,"When it's sweltering here in our Palm Springs desert paradise, clothing optional settings and activities are a natural for many locals and visitors.  So if it's summer and you live here, odds are that you're already naked as you read this.

In the soothing NUDE YOGA & TAI CHI ($20), five buck-naked youngish women go through relatively easy yoga and tai chi routines. To someone who is an amateur of both disciplines, the yoga seemed superior to the tai chi.

When this title was first released on home video, it was  criticized by some hard core feminists as merely another excuse to exploit naked women with large, augmented, breasts and that it's nothing more than soft core titillation.

Maybe and maybe not.

Since sexual energy is an element of yoga (remember Madonna's suggestive yoga poses in W magazine?), if this digital routine arouses, perhaps that's just an added bonus.  The low key elevator music and the almost hypnotic, non-intrusive narration make this a nice morning or evening routine to either get the blood flowing or to wind down.

Not Rated: Full frontal nudity (sometimes with socks).  Genre: Exercise.  95 Minutes.",1122940800,26,1141,4.957894736842105
1333263,1,B00003UC8V,"I first viewed this as a VHS about three years ago as part of a research project. Not only is the Tai-Chi and Yoga useless, and the girls completely ineptthe girls also spend most of their time covering their genitals with their hands whenever they go into an open-legged squating position as if they are frightened and embarrassed by what they are doing. If the DVD is the same low-quality production as the VHS, I would not waste my time and money.",1064361600,38,450,4.5
1333264,4,B00003UC8V,"Yoga and Tai Ci are spitirtual technics to train the body to be in shape and to evolve spiritually; presenting it naked is a brilliant idea, since nakedness fits the concept of natural and spirituality is the essence naturalism.
It is an actual plus the fact that it can be arousing at the same time, to stimulate the sexual chakra during the exercise.
This movie is well made and the basic movements of both yoga and tai chi are pretty well expressed.
It could have been a much better movie though if they would have used women with real..., I have nothing against silicon ...., but it is in net contrast with the idea of natural.
They should/could have used one person for the yoga and one person for the tai chi, and still focused on finding  pleasent or even better beautiful real teacher of one and the other.
One more thing naked does mean without socks, and in yoga especially socks should not be an optional.",1059177600,12,916,4.485029940119761

We stretched our muscles while watching nude women bend back and forth. My wife loved it more than I did, and we never get sick of it.

1333267,4,B00003UC8V,"I have used this DVD on and off for several months.  I have found the Yoga section to be very useful in stretching my body and teaching my the (very) basics of Yoga. I am not into the spirituality of Yoga...I enjoy the stretch and the different positions the DVD take the user through.  There are about 20-25 positions that stretch and work opposite muscle groups.  Some of these positions are fairly tough; while others are easier.  I work out a lot at the gym (cardio and weight lifting) and fid this DVD to be a great training aid when used once a week to keep me limber.
The Tai Chi section of the DVD is less than helpful.  It is almost completely useless.  The movements are not well documented and are not shot at multiple angles to show proper form.  Form and movement are very important inTai Chi.  This section of the DVD is the pits. I have removed one star from the rating for the terrible Tai Chi section.
In all, the Yoga section of the DVD is excellent for the beginner.  The nude models are kind of strange to get used to.  But after a few sessions, you start to work on the positions and not think about the models. Worth every penny.",1024617600,13,1151,4.287037037037037
