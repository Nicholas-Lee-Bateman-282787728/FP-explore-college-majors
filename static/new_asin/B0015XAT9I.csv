3148400,5,B0015XAT9I,"This story of three sisters and their families preparing for and serving their Seder is totally heartwarming and allows people to see the holiday not so much in terms of the tale of the Jews being freed from Egypt, but what the tradition of the holiday has done for Jewish families for centuries in the ""modern"" era.  I see my Bubbe in all these women.",1377561600,2,352,4.415384615384616
3148401,5,B0015XAT9I,"The insight into this family's celebration of Seder made this 'southern shiksa' so enthralled that I bought both the dvd and cookbook!  It was so fun to watch the sisters cook, fuss and laugh with each other while telling the family stories.  Being from a small town, there was no occasion to know any Jews until I left home for college and later the workforce in Atlanta.  I then got to celebrate Hanukkah with a coworker but that was the extent of my knowledge. Moving back to that small town a decade later reinforced my lack of knowledge.  When I first saw this airing on PBS something about it made me really interested in the customs and rituals that are followed by the Jewish faith especially at Passover.  These women somehow spoke to my 48 year old southern baptist christian soul and made me want to be less ignorant of Jewish religion and customs.  Being from the south, we're all about food so it was with that in mind I had to get the cookbook too. I will try to make matzo balls and chicken soup.  Maybe even a cholent!  I googled the sisters recently and was saddened to find that all the sisters have now passed away but oh what a legacy of love and laughter they have left us for future viewing.  Get the dvd for your own video library because you'll want to watch this over and over.",1359244800,3,1302,4.369294605809128

3148403,4,B0015XAT9I,"I just wanted to comment on how much I have enjoyed watching this little film.  I caught part of it on TV one night and thought I just had to see what all I missed.  So, as soon as I found it on Amazon I ordered my copy right away and was so happy that I did.
I really enjoyed this family and their traditions.  I'm not even Jewish, but it warms my heart to see the love in this family and how the elder women of the family put together the dinner.  It reminded me of how my late grandmother and her sister's would fret over the preperations of our family holiday get-togethers.  I think what I got from this film is the knowledge that even though we all are different in our own ways we're still people with love for our families.  I'm sending out a special thank-you to the Dubroff Family for sharing with us an enjoyable evening with their family.",1334793600,4,850,4.152439024390244

I watched this on TV last night and it has to rank as one of the most delightful pieces I've ever seen. And, I'm not even Jewish (although I'm working on getting the three signatures so I can get in!)This is what that often misused term ""family values"" is all about. Watch it.

Their closeness and their down to earthedness (LOL) was warm and inviting.  The food was mouth watering.  I loved every minute of it.  Thank you Dubroff Family for inviting me to spend time with your amazing family!  Now.  Let's talk about the cookbook.  Am I hallucinating?  $902.00 - $2,000.00????????  Anyone care to elucidate for me as to why?????  FLOORED I am.  FLOORED.  Needless to say I won't be ordering it.  YIKES!",1462752000,,540,5.057471264367816

8260329,5,B0015XAT9I,"I've been privileged to own this wonderful, heart-warming DVD; I watch it every Lent (I'm not Jewish) and at least three times during the year, maybe more, b/c seeing all the family interaction, their love for each other, the tears and laughter, reminds me of my Sicilian family, who gather together over the 4th of July.  There are only two member of the original immigrant family, and it's sad to know how much we'll miss when they are gone.  I wish my immediate family lived closer to the core family---we just don't see our brothers/sisters/cousins/nieces/nephews/aunts/uncles anywhere near as often as I wish we could.  So, by imitating the Dubroff Family and drawing my children, their spouses and my grandchildren close for a big impromptu meal or a holiday, I feel our own traditions are living on and on, as the Dubroffs are doing.  It has made all the difference!",1427241600,2,873,4.8389261744966445
