7752168,5,B01FXM2Q2O,"Wow, I can't remember the last time an anime did something completely unexpected, but true to its world. And this one has done it multiple times. This second season overturned quite a few expectations, like our natural assassin being foiled. But it emphasized itself as well, reiterating that even betrayal is forgiven because it is a tool - so long as you continue to improve. The stories and characters are better, and my soft spot for teachers in anime are truly satisfied. It's still got random humor, like tribute to the Japanese television show Before After was hilarious, as I love that show. Truly, though, this second season gets back on the rails after the wild leap of the 2nd part of the first season when they went on vacation. And it's obvious that things are being tightly wound and focused. The school is the battleground, and graduation/the end of the world are coming. How will the second half of the 2nd season end? I can't wait to see!",1466812800,6,955,4.65680473372781

7752178,4,B01FXM2Q2O,"Season One ends with a botched assassination attempt on the seemingly unkillable Koro Sensei--albeit it was very clever and well-planned but for naught.  Koro Sensei pulls out his ""trump cards of trump cards"" to avoid almost certain death but at an inpertune time as the students of 3-E fall serevely sick due to a madman.

Yes the class goes on vacation at the beach.... and for once it's not filler!",1470960000,2,401,4.714285714285714
