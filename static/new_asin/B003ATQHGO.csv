8545265,4,B003ATQHGO,"I bought this tape thinking it would show a couple of nice Wing Chun movements for on the ground. This First Part gives FIFTY different maneuvers for ground situations. Rand Williams is one of the best known teachers of Wing Chun in the Western world. I think he runs a bodyguard agency out of Germany. These techniques concentrate on a no-nonsense counter and get up approach suitable particularly for those who don't want to or have the time to stay on the ground. He uses counter strikes and leverage to get right to the point and, if you have Wing Chun experience or not, the moves are practical and can be easily learned though having a partner to work with would be a tremendous help. A lot of ideas and methods for having an immediate answer to the ground.",1269129600,,763,4.496402877697841
