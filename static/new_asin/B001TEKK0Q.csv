8341140,5,B001TEKK0Q,"I loved this video, Quality, homemade beeswax candles were made that will burn beautifully and long. (not like a cheap candle). It is a slow process and you do need some unique materials but, most can be found in the home or found cheaply at garage sales,Thrift stores etc. Pressed flowers were introduced along with how to make fancy candles and glow lamps. Highly recommended for people who have patience and a love for quality! Great gift ideas included too!",1391126400,4,461,4.775
8341141,4,B001TEKK0Q,"I own several of these movies and haven't found one I didn't like. The West ladies encourage you to try the crafts, sewing or cooking offered. They are the type of women you would like to go home with and chat over a cup of herbal tea. Love these videos and they would make wonderful gifts.",1301184000,9,290,4.196428571428571
8341142,5,B001TEKK0Q,"I received  the complete collection for a gift and what a delight these dvds are! I have never had an interest in candle making, it sounded complicated and time consuming but after watching this dvd I am inspired to try. The ladies make it look like fun instead of tedium and they also share tips to make things go smoothly and safely.",1262131200,8,335,4.403225806451613
