8075808,5,156219951X,"Okay, this is the third attempt to review this terrific little movie. Amazon's piranhas appear to have dispensed with the first two tries.
 ""Big Boobs Buster"" is brought to us by the same company which  released ""Weather Woman"" and ""Zero Woman: Assassin  Lovers"". They are obviously filling a need and providing a service.
  This movie is the heart-warming story of a young lady who desperately  loves a young gentleman. Summoning her courage she confesses her love to  him. He concedes that she is indeed beautiful, intelligent, athletic, and a  fine exemplar of the domestic skills. Unhappily, her breasts are too small  for his taste, so he tosses her aside. Hurt as one only can be by romantic  rejection, she decides there is but one course of action open to her:  revenge.
  She takes to the night and sporting a costume consisting of a  tunic, cape, and a pair of rad sunglasses doubling as a mask, armed with a  computer disc with a database of all the large-breasted girls at her school  which she stole from a lecherous teacher, she becomes Big Boobs Buster. She  stalks the girls by night, hunting them down. She attacks, rips open their  blouses, and makes silicone moulds of their breasts which she later hangs  on her living room wall, a hobby which does not seem to inconvenience her  parents. As for her fate and what transpires after she goes for the captain  of the track team, I leave it to the gentle reader to discover.
 Did I  mention that this is a Japanese movie? No, really, it is. The original  title is ""Kyo-nyuu hantaa"" (Large Breast Hunter). As with  ""Weather Woman"" this movie is highly recommended for serious  students of the Japanese language who desire supplemental language  practice. Non-students of Japanese may have to content themselves with an  hour or so of watching cute, jiggly-breasted Japanese girls having their  blouses ripped open. (But they won't be able fully to appreciate the  nuances of dialogue and character, poor folk.)
  This movie is amusing,  dopey, and does not take itself too seriously. Also, as a bonus (of sorts)  there is a trailer, a frenetic announcer breathlessly giving us a  behind-the-shots look at the creation of the movie. Watch poor Harumi Kai  fall off her bike. And again. And a third time. Relive the moment when she  was tossed into the swimming pool. See the staging of the Battle with the  Girl with the Metal Brassiere.
 So, all in all, a movie to be  recommended to friends and family. Enjoy.",956707200,27,2475,4.7725118483412325
