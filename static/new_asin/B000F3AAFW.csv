8116670,5,B000F3AAFW,"The characters in ""El Inocente"" made this film absolutely hilarious. I laughed throughout the entire movie, with the exception of a few tender scenes. Performances were flawless. Silvia's character, Mane, was annoying (excessive crying), but funny at the same time. My favorite character was Mane's mom. She wears the pants in her marriage, which adds to the humor along with her dramatic and exaggerated reactions to every situation. Pedro Infante sings beautifully, as usual. He portrayed the role of a humble mechanic beautifully. I watched this movie once with my mother when I was eleven years old. I am now 36, and it is more funny now than it was back then. I highly recommend this movie!",1354752000,,695,4.948717948717949
8116671,5,B000F3AAFW,"I loved watching this movie as a child and was so happy to finally get it on DVD.

Sylvia Pinal and Pedro Infante are wonderful on the screen together.  My favorite line was Sarah Garcia's ""Tu no opinas nada.""

My daughter also loves this movie.  Great family movie.",1328486400,2,266,4.479166666666667
8116672,5,B000F3AAFW,"A minor automobile accident on the eve of New Years, makes Man (Silvia Pinal), a beautiful girl who was running away after a fight with her fiancee, met Cutberto (Pedro Infante), a mechanic. He can not fix her car and takes her instead to her parents house in Cuernavaca. Once there, after the small talk during the trip, they start drinking and one thing leads to another, so they end up falling asleep in each other's arms. The following day, when her parents arrive, find them together and think the worse of them.

But Man and Cutberto didn't do anything. Man's father (scar Ortz de Pinedo) understands perfectly, buy his wife (Doa Sara Garca) doesn't allow anybody to clarify and decides they will have to marry. Of course the marriage will be dissolved as soon as possible, they will do this to save her reputation.

What nobody expects is that between Man and Cutberto a little spark changes everything, they fall in love, but with her parents around, things get bad and they end up fighting and thinking they hate each other. Only him can save that relationship... but, is he ready? She's been a little hurtful...

Pedro Infante proves one more time that besides a great singer and actor, he was also a great comedian. Watch ESCUELA DE VAGABUNDOS, and if you watch ROMEO CONTRA JULIETA, do it on your own risk...",1316908800,,1320,4.656652360515022

8116674,5,B000F3AAFW,"El Inocente(1955) is a classic Mexican film starring Pedro Infante and Silvia Pinal and directed by Rogelio A. Gonzalez. It was remade in 1968 as Romeo Contra Julieta with Angelica Maria and Alberto Vasquez. On New Years Eve, Mane(Pinal)throws a fit in front of her boyfriend and she takes off in her car. On her way to Cuernavaca, her car stalls and breaks down on the highway. A mild mannered mechanic, Gutberto Gaudazar/Cruzi(Infante), gives her a ride to her parents' house in Mexico City. Mane and Cruzi get drunk on champagne and they pass out on eachother! Mane's parents(played by Sara Garcia and Carlos Ortiz de Pinedo)find Cruzi and Mane the following morning...and they jump to the wrong conclusion that Cruzi raped her! Mane's parents force Cruzi to marry Mane to save the family's good reputation(""a shotgun wedding""). What's to become of Cruzi and Mane and their bitterness toward eachother?
 El Inocente is an almost flawless film...almost! Silvia Pinal's shrill, whiny voice can hurt one's ears! In the plus column, Manuel Esperon composed and conducted a memorable score for the film(Sergio Guerrero scored the remake, Romeo Contra Julieta).  Infante and Pinal do have chemistry with eachother and the cast give solid performances.
The song that Mane and Cruzi sing and dance to in the living room is really catchy! I wonder where screenwriters Luis and Janet Alcoriza got the inspiration for the plot? El Inocente stands up to multiple viewings! Enjoy!",1207958400,4,1470,5.095435684647303
