7935958,4,B00005ASPR,"This is the first round of the greatest mixed martial arts tournament of all time.  Eight of the sixteen tournament competitors advance to the finals, which is in another tape.  The Finals tape is better, but this is definitely worth seeing as well.  The worst fight is Nobuhiko Takada vs Royce Gracie, where Takada does nothing for 12 of the 15 minutes, merely lying on top of his opponent.  The best fight was a controversial 'forfeit', later declared a 'no contest' between Guy Mezger and Kazushi Sakuraba.  The complete card is as follows: Vanderlei Silva vs Bob Schreiber (not part of tournament)-- Akira Shoji vs Ebenezer Braga -- Gary Goodridge vs Tachikari -- Mark Coleman vs Masaaki Satake -- Mark Kerr vs Enson Inoue -- Igor Vovchanchin vs Alexander Otsuka -- Kazuyuki Fujita vs Hans Nijman -- Royce Gracie vs Nobuhiko Takada -- Kazushi Sakuraba vs Guy Mezger",993081600,3,869,4.844594594594595
7935959,4,B00005ASPR,Pride is one of the hottest mixed martial arts organizations in the world today. Nine fights are on this video. Vanderlei Silva vs. Bob Schrjiber is a good fight but short. UFC veteran Gary Goodridge vs. Osamu Tachihikari is a good fight but is not as great as Goodridge's other matches. Akira Shoji vs. Ebenezer Fontes Braga was a great fight because both fighters have a great talent for this sport. Kazuyuki Fujita vs. Hans Nyman is short and sweet and a good debut of Fujita in Pride. Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Guy Mezger was tough fight for both men but the ending may leave a bad taste in your mouth. Mark Coleman vs. Masaaki Satake in another short bout but exciting. Igor Vovchanchin vs. Alexander Otsuka in a long fight but the result won't surprise you. Mark Kerr vs. Enson Inoue is another long fight but it is good to watch. And the main event was Royce Gracie making he return to fighting since UFC 5 against Nobuhiko Takada in a of the most boring fights I have seen since UFC 9 match between Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn. If you are in to Mixed Martial Arts then this video for you.,992908800,3,1091,4.405940594059406
