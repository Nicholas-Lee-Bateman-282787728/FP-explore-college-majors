I suggested my friend purchase a spinning bike for home, as it can be hard to get to the classes at a gym when you have a difficult work schedule.  I suggested the Hawaii 3 DVD box set to get her started and she loved it, then I let her borrow the Spain Big Ring Bonanza to try out something different, now she is buying the DVDs.  My husband and I have, France, Hawaii, Italy box sets.  I made the mistake of buying the single DVD Spain Big Ring Bonanza, I high recommend buying the 3 DVD Spain set, this series is my favorite out of all the ones we have in our workout collection.  I like the options of selecting a 45 minute workout or 90 minute workout.  The 90 minute work out is my favorite one to do on a Friday and then take the weekend off, then select the 45 minute workout on Monday and then move onto the 1 hour sessions.  I am looking forward to another DVD box series like Spain.",1419811200,,935,4.048913043478261
8554551,5,B00AN7VO8C,"Global Ride is the well known for producing quality cycling dvds. Big Ring Bonanza in Spain is no exception. The ride is excellent. With on the road coaching, it's that much more realistic and intense. The ride itself has everything. The climbs are not super steep, but steady and varied. Nice addition for anyone who rides indoors. The music is great. Again, another stellar production via global ride.",1362009600,,403,4.9411764705882355
