I'll be ready while women with life preservers race down the beach in slow motion bouncing and jiggling on the wet sand, aahhhh yes.
Many people have stated that they learned to life saving techniques because of this show. If you look closely you can find many camels on the beach, it's one of the hidden treasures !",1446336000,,454,4.617283950617284
6097827,5,B00GP9B0Q8,"I'm glad this was released like this. After the initial US releases, with all of their problems, I figured something like this would never happen. Luckily, even though it's an Aussie import, they decided to release it without a regional code.
This is quite the set really.
Almost everything is included. ""Hawaiian Wedding"" is NOT included in the set. They should have called this set ""The Almost Complete Collection"".

I really enjoyed watching this for the first time and also getting to watch Baywatch Hawaii and Baywatch Nights as I'm sure they won't be in reruns on TV like the regular Baywatch has been lately. It's a strange show. For instance when a cast member left the show, most of the time it had to be explained in the following season and a lot of the time it wasn't explained very well. But it's the kind of show where it doesn't matter when that has happened. Like when Pamela Anderson left the show, the explanation was acceptable. But it's strange watching some of the episodes out of order (most of them are in order, but one of the seasons has a bunch out of order) especially the ones where someone leaves the show, like Yasmine Bleeth, only to be back with no explanation soon after. I think the weirdest one was when Gena Lee Nolin replaced the original person playing Neely, only to be replaced after multiple seasons of being the character in season 9 with someone who didn't seem that similar. Plus, Baywatch Hawaii season 2 doesn't explain the cliffhanger in the last episode of season 1 which really needed to be explained since it deals with the maybe death of the main series main character (Hasselhoff), which is entirely absent in season 2 of the show. The cliffhanger of Baywatch Hawaii Season 1 didn't really get resolved. Though Mitch (Hasselhoff) who disappears at the end of Baywatch Hawaii season 1, reappears in ""Hawaiian Wedding"" which is absent from the set.
Only problems I had with the set were one of the discs of Baywatch Nights wouldn't play correctly in my Blu-Ray Player. Stopped and wouldn't play the last of one episode and the next episode wouldn't even start. Got it to work for the most part in a laptop.
Also, a couple of the discs were cracked. But only on the spindle part, not into the discs, so it didn't effect the playability.
And lastly, the sound cuts out occasionally and it also occasionally pixelizes for a second. Which is annoying, but for something I didn't think I'd ever get to see in it's entirety, I can overlook.",1442880000,7,2484,4.6454545454545455
6097828,2,B00GP9B0Q8,"I forgot how bad this show was, but when this product all of the dvd cases were broken, which was fine by me, but now that we made it to season 8 I have 2 disk 2 and no disk 1, thats kinda pretty upsetting. Other than all of that its alright I guess.",1440633600,,250,3.6481481481481484

6097833,5,B00GP9B0Q8,"OK OK, before you freak out over the price, and yes it
is up there, LOOK at all that you are getting.......
All 9 seasons of the original Baywatch plus the other
Baywatch series that came after.
It took a while for all the seasons of the original Baywatch
to be released, but for those of us that watched them when
they first aired, this is a must have collection.
I have worked as a Lifeguard, at both a pool and beach, and
enjoyed Baywatch from that aspect of it.
Those were indeed the days.
And now you can watch all of the episodes, again and again,
whenever you wish, and maybe even get the urge, to get that
beach body back again.
All of the music is also here, on the 79 DVD's, that make up the
Complete Collection.
So, step back in time, and walk on the Baywatch beach once again,
and bring your sun screen with you..........",1427155200,14,833,4.2125
6097834,5,B00GP9B0Q8,This is a great collection to own it has all the seasons of the series Baywatch in order of their appearance on televsion.  There is a great cast of characters and guest stars in each episode.  The series teaches about lifeguarding but also touches on real life issues and the aftermath and affect of them on the people around.  They even show how a person becomes a lifeguard and how demanding it is on a family life.  Also it shows how people view lifeguarding as a profession and the public's view of this profession.  This is a great series for anyone who likes the water or wonders what lifeguarding is all about.,1423353600,12,618,4.482142857142857
6097835,5,B00GP9B0Q8,Been looking for Baywatch on DVD forever. So happy to finally have it,1423267200,3,69,4.384615384615385
6097836,5,B00GP9B0Q8,"Very Pleasantly surprised.  ALL the original music was there.  Enya, Yanni et al.  And of course the opening themes.  Now I can watch Baywatch with my kids as it was intended.  Made the price worthwhile.  The ""beach towel"" bonus was cheesy and vacuum packed/pressed into the shape of a rescue can.  It was packed as a spacer into the DVD box to keep them from moving.  I won't even open it.  Each season has a nice DVD case with 6 discs 4 episodes per disc.  Overall very nicely packed high quality set but don't buy it for the towel.",1422316800,12,534,4.303030303030303

6097841,5,B00GP9B0Q8,"I purchased this set and was very excited to have it. It contains all seasons of Baywatch, Baywatch Hawaii and Baywatch Nights. It also includes a Baywatch workout dvd and Baywatch towel! While this set is near perfect, the first season (the one that aired on NBC) does contain the substituted theme song that was used on the dvds and not the Pete Cetera ""Save Me"" song. I have not notice any other song substitutes yet and some of the other original music seems to be intact. Definitely worth buying this set as we may never see a American set released like this. This set from Australia is a region zero and NTSC. Will play in any American dvd players!",1405987200,32,654,4.458333333333333

8626078,4,B00GP9B0Q8,"When the price was right (sadly, it's gone WAAAAY up again), this collection was THE way to watch all of Baywatch without having to buy farily costly idividual season sets from Germany or Australia which used to be the only way to watch all seasons with the original music before this set came out.  Unfortunately, this still isn't what I'd call a totally definitive set (if a remastered Bluray comes out, I'll ditch this one in a nanosecond) since there's a bit of quality control defects such as micro instances of audio dropping out (it can sometimes happen multiple times per episode on some seasons where a word gets muted out at random during a sentence) and/or bizarre instances of a video frame from earlier in an episode popping up later on making you blink, rewind, pause and find Waldo (you'll be watching, then see a quick glitch, rewind and pause, and see that it's a frame or two from a scene earlier on... makes no sense to me that that occurs but I can verify that it does on occasion although fortunately this is not the norm... it's still a bit annoying though since this isn't exactly a low cost item).  That glitch/frame thing used to happen sometimes back during VHS home recordings when we'd record a new show on a tape that already had recordings on it due to dust/debris on the physical tape, but I have no idea why that happens sporadically (very sporadically, fortunately) on a few episodes of this DVD box set.  The video quality apart from those occasional glitches, though, is perfectly acceptable (not stellar but as watchable as it was back in the day), but don't expect remastered crystal clear Bluray quality (you'll squint during some scenes, just some though, and wonder if the picture looks fuzzy/grainy/pixelly due to that being how it always looked or due to DVD transfer/compression).  The show itself is AWESOME and a great way to visit the beach from home without having to suck in your gut.  It's also a great motivator to get in shape to.  Pop this show in, run in place (slow motion or regular speed), lift some weights, and you can kill two birds with one stone.  If this show ever gets the full Bluray treatment, I'm such a sap that I'll be there... just as I was for the VHS tapes and all the various domestic and foreign DVD sets.  For now, though, this is the set to own despite the less than perfect audio/video quality.  The flaws are not enough that I'd never say to skip this one if the price was right again.  If this sucker stays at the $999.99 price tag, though, forget it.  Get yourself a region free player and grab the German release individual season sets.  That might be a bit of a pain since you have to price shop and wait for them to ship, but you'll save yourself a lot of money and there are less audio/video glitches on those sets than this one.",1501286400,,2812,4.5137795275590555

I am overly excited, because I can watch the show anytime I feel like it, and I don't have to wait for the reruns to air on television! I have been going to YouTube to watch the episodes too, but I don't have to go there anymore, just pop in a DVD and get to watching it! All of the DVD discs are inside the package, and an exercise DVD is included too! The picture is outstanding! The price is worth it for all of the seasons! Pamela Anderson is my favorite!!
