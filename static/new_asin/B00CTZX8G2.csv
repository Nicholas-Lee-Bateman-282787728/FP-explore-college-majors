5740524,3,B00CTZX8G2,"I am a fairly critical reviewer of horror, primarily because today it is so inexpensive (both in time and money) for most anyone to create a movie and upload it to Amazon and elsewhere, that there is a glut of absolutely terrible ""films"" on the market today (and I think that now that genie is out of the bottle, so this is the new reality of the horror movie genre). Anyway, suffice to say that I have spent a lot of my meager disposable income on streaming movies here on Amazon and on Netflix, with very few real creepy and spooky moments to show for it - especially with regard to ""lost footage"" films which are the most conducive to those no/low budget movies I mentioned. So it was with no small amount of surprise when I found myself genuinely creeped out by The Bake Street Hauntings. I won't give any spoilers here, and while this movie is not perfect, it makes up for its shortcomings (one big one being wayyy too many F-bombs - OH and the chemistry between the ""husband"" and ""wife"" is non-existent in those roles - they are more like a brother and sister who haven't seen each other in awhile and are throw together and commence to the old nagging sibiling back-and-forth - you won;t buy them as a couple, trust me) with a few - correction, more than a few - moments that brought me back to the same chills I got from Blair Witch, Session 9, and others. Part of it has to do with the dialog, which never seems scripted (pardon the pun) and actually seemed pretty genuine. I am guessing the director encouraged a lot of ad libbing, which works perfectly in Bake Street. Good camera work, which also, again, made this feel much more believable than 90% of its kind in the low budget lost footage genre (esp with the lack of nightvision, which works extremely well here, and is fairly unique in this day and age when every horror movie has the cast using a nightvision-equipped home camera). I definitely recommend this one - and I recommend watching it in the dark, preferably alone, for maximum spooky factor (and yes I suppose most horror works well in that setting, but it works especially well here). I have recommended this one to my friends and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.",1374105600,6,2206,4.503740648379052
5740525,3,B00CTZX8G2,"I felt I had to rent this and write a review, considering that at least one of the reviews already on here was written by a cast member.  I have seen just about every haunted house and found footage film available, and most of them are complete crap.  I'm happy to say that this one bucks the trend and is actually not horrible.  Still, I wouldn't say that it's good, but it seems to be an achievement to make an indie horror flick that's simply tolerable.

The movie is very short - just 70 minutes - which makes it great as a short diversion.  However, it also leaves little room to develop characters or a plot.  As a result, both end up being wafer thin and easily forgettable.  Even the house, which used to be the main character in any haunted house story, as well as the ghosts themselves, have taken supporting roles in a movie that really stars a few good haunt scenes.  Thankfully, these scenes are the movie's real strong points, and I dare say that some of them were creepy.  I won't issue any spoilers, but suffice it to say that I think these moments are above average for the genre.

There were two things that made this film difficult to watch.  The first is the movie itself.  Not only is it dark, it's shot in black and white, and I could hardly follow the passage of time.  This is inexplicable, since hand held recorders have been recording color in daylight for well over a decade.  To make matters even worse, the house is filled with security cams, to which the editor has applied digital filters to give them scan lines.  If you want to frustrate your viewers, occlude their view with scan lines, it works every time.  Secondly, there's music.  This makes the movie not so much ""found footage"" as ""found, carefully edited and scored footage"".  None of it adds to the mood of any scene, and it ends up being scan-lines for the ears.

All in all, it's not a bad way to spend a few dollars and an hour of your life.  If you're a fan of indie horror, give it a chance.",1373587200,15,1988,4.336043360433604
5740526,5,B00CTZX8G2,"Yes, this is a found footage movie. A sub-genre of Horror we see more often since the success of the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. As a life long horror enthusiast and critic, I have seen many similar films fall flat on their face. What separates it from the pack of ""quickie cash in's"", is the performances of the couple in the film. I found the way they dealt with the unimaginable horror they find to quite realistic. The pacing of the film is quick and tight. The scares are very effective and chilling. With the exception of a few swear words, the film can be viewed with the entire family (well not anyone under about 14 or so) and will give you just what you want: a creepy ghost story. The plot set up itself is very reminiscent of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits"". The classic ""MacGuffin"" device, of a mysterious man whom is offering a substantial opportunity to strangers. I really dug that and it was a very Hitchcockian set up. Is this the scariest film I've ever seen? No. However, I watch a lot of Horror movies, (upwards of 6 a week) What this film has, that others don't, is heart. That's rare in this genre. So I say, check it out!",1372291200,4,1160,4.4

That being said this is hands down one of the best found footage movies. I am a scary movie freak and horror genre buff and this movie had sine scary ass scenes. It is low budget but they did great. Acting was even believable. Mad props to the writers and producers and composers because it looks like they are all the same people. You guys killed it. I loved it. Really one of my favorite low budget movies.,1430697600,3,544,4.29126213592233
5740533,2,B00CTZX8G2,"There's a whole lot wrong with this Found Footage film. It's jumpy, black and white, in an era of incredible digital ( as well as COLOR ) camera recording, jumping around from moment to moment, as well as MUCH recording and surprise it's STILL only day one. Same for day two, and three..
I wasn't expecting too much, but got even less. The days go on forever with NOTHING going on. Still I could be patient, waiting for SOMETHING to happen....SURPRISE!  nothing goes awry. A young girl wafts across the camera view is pretty much the bulk of the first two thirds of the movie,
As well as outside...then a time or two of a woman or man...You never find out..in black, rifling through a box of pictures...intense?...NO...Dumb?...YES!...The lights going out was pretty much expected, with not a lot transpiring there. The little missus gets scared a few times..the husband too....Hey starts digging in the basement...WHY?..I DON'T KNOW!.. in a fireplace pit, to find, some skeletal remains...EGAD a treasure trove of scared...NOT! At the end I was blissfully aware that SOMETHING was going to happen...A white face blackened hither and thither to make a pseudo skeletal looking face appears at the foot of the bed peering at the couple in bed as they watch in horror...

5740542,5,B00CTZX8G2,"I know this little slice of low budget horror heaven will not be treated well. That's a shame. This is a wonderful little movie. The fact that it's in black and white only adds to the wonderfully creepy atmosphere. And guess what? There is actually a plot! I've never heard of either of the actors in the film, but they do a great job acting out the naturalness of the relationship between them as newly weds looking to win a big prize by staying in a haunted house for a week. The haunting episodes build night after night (and some during the day), and the final treatment in the bedroom still makes me jump up and turn the light on if I think about it too much late at night. Granted, the first twenty minutes or so is a little slow, setting up the situation, but then it's off to the haunted races. I hope people will give this movie a chance. It's intensely atmospheric, has a great plot, some truly awesome scares, and great acting. Five stars!",1401753600,4,950,4.342696629213483
5740543,4,B00CTZX8G2,"I think some of the bad reviews for this movie were written by one disgruntled person, so take them with a grain of salt.

5740544,3,B00CTZX8G2,"Ok, I will include a possible spoiler at the end, but it's more of an assumption than a spoiler because somewhere I seem to have gotten lost in the story.

Basically, a couple is offered $2 million to stay in a house for a week.  A man we never see supposedly offered them this dare via a lawyer, whom again...we never see. The original transaction between the lawyer and the couple was done on video cam, but the cam is left in the house and I'm going to assume that film was either erased or never existed since we never see that footage. I agree with one reviewer as I did not get the feel of a couple in love, but that may be just poor acting. And who would accept the offer not knowing what this house is all about? So greed is what I get from our two ""buddies."" Kind of like those people that try and try so many ""get rich quick"" schemes (scams)! Anyway, there are some very creepy parts and being a sucker for found footage movies, good and bad, and at the price....yeah, it's worth it.

Possible spoiler.......

My assumption is that, like the family before where old pictures were found, our mysterious rich man will now use all of the footage he got (via cams in every room) to make an offer to a new family/couple and our current couple will now replace the current haunters (the creepy family). Perhaps ""piers"" is a serial killer and will kill our happy couple, bury their bones and leave their footage to be found by a new couple. It's a guess, since nothing was ever completely clear in this movie.

Three stars for the creepiness!",1398988800,,1545,4.3321799307958475

5740548,3,B00CTZX8G2,I love me some found footage movies and this one had its creepy moments. A couple scenes have actually stuck with me a couple days-week after I've seen it. Overall not a bad watch if you want something on the mild side--you'll be able to sleep just fine.,1390867200,,254,4.3125
5740549,2,B00CTZX8G2,For me found footage is about what you don't see more than what you do. This film has it's moments but leaves unanswered questions. I had to wonder the guy who sent them to the house had to know what would happen. What was in it for him? Why didn't these people leave when they had the chance?

5740550,1,B00CTZX8G2,"The only thing I liked about this waste of brain cells was the wife.  She was believable.  Good actress, too.  You cared about her.  You liked her.

Really not a lot to base a movie on, is it?

The ghosts looked like Juggalos.  (Those fans of the insane clown posse.  Seriously.  Google the images.)  Not story ever emerges.  You can't even make one up for yourself.  It's like a jigsaw puzzel with only round pieces.  It just never becomes anything but annoying

The premise is a joke.  Someone offers a couple two million dollars to stay in a haunted house for a week.  We are supposed to believe the images captured are from either: the couple, the security cameras, or the ghosts themselves. Yet when the couple finds a box of photos they show them like on a crime drama.

5740552,2,B00CTZX8G2,"This is one of those movies that has some pieces that could have gone any number of ways and been pretty good, but instead just leaves you scratching your head at the end.  There are some good creepy moments, don't get me wrong, but they aren't consistent enough (combined with the unconvincing actors) to leave you in a state of fear like a good haunting flick should.  The premise of the film doesn't play out either.  Some dude gets a couple to agree to spend a week in a house and if they do they get 1 million bucks.  Beyond that we are only left to sort of speculate about the dude's motive which is never made clear. A bigger problem is that couple aren't really believable as a couple and the acting is just so so. The film drama/horror is also over shadowed by the feeling that the main characters could avoid horror just by say, I don't know, turning on a light or leaving, but they just aren't ever scared enough to do it even though the door is right there.  If I saw any of the things they saw, 1 million bucks couldn't keep me there.  If I don't feel like the characters are scared and in fear of their lives, I'm not going to be scared either as a viewer.",1385510400,,1170,4.200892857142857
5740553,1,B00CTZX8G2,"I had low expectations for this and sadly, was not disappointed.  The acting was horrible and not even close to believable.  The final scene was so incredibly under-acted that it might as well have been a spoof film.  I don't need high budget and famous actors for my horror but I do need to be willing to buy into the idea of what the film is trying to sell.  The Bake Street Hauntings didn't do it for me.",1383696000,,407,4.17948717948718
5740554,4,B00CTZX8G2,"This was a better than the norm B-movie. With a slightly larger budget I think that would have been a first rate box office smash. Bake St is very understated, I feel it deserves more recognition than even the producers gave it. I look forward to their next stab at horror and think they did very well with a small budget.",1382745600,,322,4.295081967213115
5740555,3,B00CTZX8G2,"In horror films (and particularly lost tape films,) the antagonist, be it a witch, a demon, a ghost, or a nebulous phenomenon, is one of if not THE main character, replete with motivations and a (preferably rich) back-story.  This not only engages the audience in the story itself, but broadcasts the sorts of dangers we can expect the protagonists to face.  Blair Witch was a popular example of the lost tapes genre that spent nearly half an hour building up the lore of the titular character.

Bake Street had numerous ways of doing the same thing in an efficient manner.  Piers, the mysterious character who offers the struggling couple $2 million to spend a week in a haunted house, would have been the perfect vehicle for this.  An interview with him (or his lawyer,) could have answered why he was willing to make such a ridiculous offer (was he performing an experiment?  Did he make a pact with the entity?  Was he perhaps part of the story of the haunting itself?)  As it was, he was the knife on the mantle that was never mentioned again; a vague, nebulous blob of unexplored potential and a waste of the audience' time.  An interview with a local historian or elderly neighbor could have also offered some exposition.  If they didn't want to go this route, they could have at least thrown some news clippings or family videos the couple's way.  Without offering any spoilers, all I got out of the back-story was that there was a family of moody people who liked to take pictures of each other, and a little girl who liked to dress up like she was going to prom, and then, at some point, one or more people died somehow.

While there were a few other obscure clues I'm likely discounting (or, I will admit, may have gone over my head,) that's it.  This is all the back-story I came away with.  As a result, the haunting felt extremely generic, and the protagonists seemed to upstage it at pretty much every turn.

So this is what it comes down to: was this film worth the $1.99 price of admission?  If you don't expect the budget or effects of The Ring, or the originality of Blair Witch, and are prepared to overlook the glaring issues above, it might be.  The stars (whom I am assuming are married IRL; they share the same last name,) have good chemistry, and appear to have inserted their own holiday/wedding footage to establish their characters, which honestly felt pretty natural.  The pacing was alright, and there are a few interesting scenes interspersed throughout the film, and the horror elements are not nearly as reliant on jump scares as one would expect given the genre.",1382140800,5,2596,4.606521739130435

5740570,2,B00CTZX8G2,"Having seen the film, I'm frankly surprised by all the 3 and 4 star ratings.  Go figure.  Anyway, forthwith the pros and cons.

Pros:
*  There are some genuinely creepy scenes in this movie.  Well done, I say.  It takes a lot to creep me out.
*  There's a beginning sense of bravado and a building sense of foreboding as the film progresses.
*  The actors are really okay.  I never was reminded that they were 'Acting with a capital A'

Cons:
*  My first clue should have been that the film is written, directed, produced, scored, and starred in by the same two people.  Always a mistake.
*  The dialog was almost completely inaudible.  Come out from behind the camera, protagonist, I really really NEED your exposition.  As it was, I had little or no idea what was going on.
*  Why these characters insisted on walking into a dark room and leaving it dark is way beyond me.  I kept yelling ""Turn. On. The. LIGHTS!"" (With the obligatory 'you idiots'.)
*  The entire film was too dark.  It was difficult to perceive anything except ominous shadows.  This may be the source of the 'creepiness' mentioned above.
*  I was very confused (and I must admit a little amused) by the ending.

In short, I've seen worse on Amazon Video (see The Duppy for an example of a truly bad effort) but there's an 'amateur' quality to this film that disappointed me.  For free, I'm glad to watch.  For 2 bucks, I think I have the right to be at least a little critical.",1375574400,,1448,4.377358490566038
5740571,1,B00CTZX8G2,"How anyone could give this so called movie 4 stars is beyond me.  The plot is so thin and predictable I could have turned it off after 5 minutes and told anyone how the movie would end.  The movie would have been a lot shorter if the creators cut out the video footage from the house cameras that showed nothing.  The only redeeming feature is that the couple do seem to have some acting skills, just don't expect it to save this movie.",1375056000,2,436,4.228915662650603

5740573,1,B00CTZX8G2,"Way too much exposition, especially for a movie barely an hour long.  The ""house"" the movie takes place in feels more like a motel with a basement.  Hardly any ""horror"" until the very end, and even that is a joke.

The fact that the movie opens and closes with some artsy music and scenic footage is hysterical given the crap content in between.  This ""movie"" was horribly stupid.  Don't reward the filmmakers even if it's only $2.  All you'll do is prolong their pathetic pipe dream that they actually have any talent and this stupid film could help make them a star.  Shoot, in that sense you're actually doing them a favor by passing.",1374969600,6,637,4.535087719298246

5740575,5,B00CTZX8G2,"This was a very scary movie, with more scary moments than most ghost stories.  I like the two million for a week concept, will definitely watch this again.  Ghost stories are my current favorite; this is a great watch.",1374278400,,218,4.564102564102564
5740576,3,B00CTZX8G2,"Another little indie found footage flick, I enjoyed it. It is not the scariest I have seen but it has its moments.  I believe the director was also the lead actor and maybe his wife or sister also helped with production and acting -- and the score.  So, it's only 70 minutes long, I think it's worth your time to give it a shot, some creepy stuff.",1374192000,,347,4.164179104477612
8586254,3,B00CTZX8G2,"This film which is entirely in black and white,had some genuinely frightening and disturbing moments. I made the mistake of watching it in the dark. There were a couple of jump scares also. So I gave it 3 stars. Otherwise,it was a fair effort. Could have been so much better,had they given it a proper ending,or at least a decent epilogue. The entire film builds and builds,and just when you're expecting a major revelation,it just doesn't happen. All of the loose ends and random events are never tied together. The viewer is left with a lot of questions,wondering what it all meant. Was the house really haunted or was it all a set up? Why was the man who offered the couple 2 million dollars to spend a week in what seemed to be a very average little house ; watching their every move through cameras? Who was the dead body they found in the cellar? Why didn't they call the police,rather than put the body in their car trunk? Why were they not allowed any contact with neighbors or the outside world,during their stay at the house? What was the fate of the young couple?  All in all though it kept my attention all the way through. And it did scare me.",1517184000,,1156,4.427230046948357

8586256,3,B00CTZX8G2,"I was surprised at how good this movie actually was.im always looking on amazon and netflix for the seemingly low budget horror films because every once and while, you find a gem that's really good. This is movie is one of those gems. It's not a fantastic movie, however, it legitimately had my heart racing. What prompted me to rent this film was it kind of stood out from the rest. Example, no cast members were named, the director was ""unknown"", and a very short excerpt explaining what the film was about intrigued me. I guess I was hoping to find legit tapes of a haunting filmed by the people experiencing it (hahahaha). However, the film was under developed. More character development and a back story on the family who had previously lived in the house would have been cool. How did the bones end up buried in the basement? Who put them there? Was that person murdered? More info would have been awesome. It's these kinds of movies that make me love horror, and it was good enough for me to actually write a review on it, which I don't even do for the films that I absolutely love.",1494720000,,1090,4.455

No. Does it scare you a bit and set a fairly plausible scenario, thus making an entertaining movie? YES.",1453507200,2,440,4.313253012048193
