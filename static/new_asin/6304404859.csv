862310,5,6304404859,"For those who don't already know, Sailor Moon is a anime/manga series about a group of teenage girls who protect Tokyo from an invasion of monsters from another dimension while wearing costumes that bear a striking resemblance to Japanese school-girl uniforms...

This DVD is the second volume of the 90s DIC dub of the series, which features heavy-handed localization and hilarious attempts at 90s slang. For anyone who watched the show in the 90s or early '00s, this is a fun romp down memory lane. For everyone else, I'd suggest going with the recent re-translation instead, as the latest English version is both less dated and far more true to the original Japanese version.",1459555200,,678,4.947368421052632

862358,5,6304404859,"Much better than the new dub. Old voices feel really good. To Hell with new dub. OLD DUB IS HISTORY, and they are much worthy and valuable. You won't  find the new dub as valuable. It's a complete joke. I only  wish  the old one could have  been HD.",1444176000,,249,4.020408163265306
862359,4,6304404859,"I chose to buy this older boxset instead of buying Viz's new DVDs due to the video problems I had read about. Let me just say that you can find this online for around $50-$150. Do not pay more than $60 because it's just not worth it with tag kind of insane mark-up. There are sellers online and on Amazon looking for $300-$400. Which is crazy because I have seen it sell for $30. I bought my copy for $45.
I already owned boxsets 1 and 2.
This boxset is an improvement on Seasons 1 & 2. While those have beautiful slipovers, those DVD cases inside are cheap and bulky. They look and feel like bootlegs.
THIS boxset comes with slim cases that are well made, and have pretty artwork. You can also get the individual volumes, but they're called the Heart Collection and are not slim DVDs.
Just to avoid confusion, the boxset says UNCUT episodes of Sailor Moon S (season 3). Which they are. So if you plan to order this because you loved the cheesy American television dub that was heavily edited for small children, you didn't bother to look into it, and you will likely be disappointed. It says uncut, because it's the uncut Japanese episodes with subtitles or dubbing. Not for small children.
I recommend this boxset, because why pay $40-$50 for a Blu-ray with half a season that doesn't look all that amazing, when you can pay around the same price for the whole season? It's out of print, but can still be found.
Some cons? The sound is not amazing. It's mono. It's not the restored high quality DVDs Japan re-released recently. This is a 2004 boxset of a early 90's anime.",1440806400,,1574,4.449826989619377

Lol, no, I'm just kidding, but I don't see what's wrong with the English dubbed version. it's what I grew up on.  I am such a big fan of Sailor Moon. She was like my inspiration to be more creative and create my own little fantasy world. I've been watching this show ever since it came out in 1995. This show is so unique and beautiful. It's not like other shows. It was better. MUCH BETTER. I've seen all of the seasons except Sailor Moon Stars. I like the English dubbed version. The undubbed version is just weird and confusing. The great thing about the show is that the characters reinvent themselves. Each season it appears to come up something different, and I like that. It would be nice to see the episodes of Sailor Moon again. That show was such an inspiration. It's brilliant! PURE BRILLIANT!!!!",1402790400,,923,4.5602409638554215

862478,1,6304404859,Just as the title says. I bought a set a few years ago from Animage. I found quickly found out that they copied the ADV Films sets and badly done. Several episodes were either cut off on the DVD's or missing. Subtitles were way off as well. Don't know how that was possible since they copied the official sets. It's not worth your money. Better off trying to find the original sets from ADV Films. This set needs to be taken down. This is partly the reason why the series hasn't had a re release because of all the bootleg copies on Amazon and other sites like E Bay and iOffer.,1399507200,5,578,4.216216216216216

Well, I bought it new and the discs were all scratched up, and so much so that Season Three wouldn't play at all!  Not only that, but Season Five was missing a disc worth of episodes, numbers 183-191.  This was not worth the money I paid for it, and I wish I hadn't bought it at all.

862483,5,6304404859,"Finally I have been able to get my hands on a official Sailor Moon DVD. This DVD contains both the dub and the sub, if you prefer the sub, this isn't for those under the age of 13. When I received this DVD, i was absolutely excited to flip it in and watch it, and since the box set of Supers is pricey, and if your not able to afford that set i highly recommend purchasing the individual DVDs, plus you get more pretty pictures haha. This disc contains 6 uncut episodes which include, 1)The Secret of Pegasus! The Handsome Guardian of the Dream World, 2)Rini's (Chibi-Usa's) Little Rhapsody of Love, 3)Dream to be an Adult! The Amazoness' Bewilderment, 4)Coming Terror! The Dark Queen's Evil Approach, 5)The Center of the Darkness: Dead Moon Circus, and 6)Labyrinth of Mirrors! Mini Moon (Chibi Moon) Captured.

862485,5,6304404859,This brings back soo many childhood memories. The DVD is better than any VHS I have from television recordings. All the english episodes are there and in order.

862543,3,6304404859,"I wanted to buy this but when I saw on the description that there's no japanese audio for season 1 and 2 I was disappointed. I did not like the english dubbed AT ALL! Good thing they stopped. Because I watched this from beginning to end and the english version is like a cover up(they think kids are stupid) I believe someone said that there were missing parts in some episodes...that will drive me nuts. I will buy this if they release it again, when all of them have japanese audio.",1390867200,2,484,4.329670329670329
862544,5,6304404859,"My girlfriend grew up on this show. I was determined to find her a set that included, at the very least, all the seasons in English that aired in America. I look everywhere and quickly realized half of the collections available were bad quality imports from China or Malaysia. Some Europeans imports were good but wouldn't play on our DVD player so what could we do?

I kept searching!

I ended up ordering three different collections and only kept the one I thought was best value for money. My gf owns the ultimate version of this set, and I gifted this one to my sister for Christmas. Here's why I think it's the best collection on the market.
-The new 2013 edition now includes a beautiful full color glossy inlay card that lists all the episodes per disc. Very useful.
-The DVD boxsets are beautiful and glossy as well (without any smell, which is common with cheap imports)
-The discs holders are of high quality. Not a single disc, out of the fifty, arrived scratched or undone. Three years ago I bought a Battlestar Galactica collection and the discs came in paper sleeves... my discs arrived loose all over the box, and I had paid 200$ for it, and it was manufactured in America! So you gotta do your homework people.
-The boxsets are collectible and there's a coherent design that makes them look like an actual collection if placed on a bookshelf.
-It's cheap compared to what you would have paid in the 90s or early 2000s to get all the VHS or DVD. Back then they were milking it a few episodes at a time on each tape or disc. It would have cost three times as much as this for the same amount of content.

But ultimately what really matters is the quality of the sound and the image and I was thoroughly impressed. Keeping in mind that this is a show from the early 90s and that it's been twenty years since it first aired, the show stills holds up in the look department. The animations are relatively crisp even at 1080p resolution (upconverted). The sound is without artifacts and is clear as well.

People might rise their eyebrow at the price but this collection includes five boxsets. That's five seasons, UNCUT, three movies, in both English and Japanese audio, with perfect grammar in the subtitles. Fifty discs overall. It's a lot of material.

Thanks for this, my girl is the happiest gal on the Earth! And the Moon! :)",1390176000,5,2342,4.514150943396227

862547,2,6304404859,"I'm sorry, but this collection is terrible.

I ordered the ultimate uncut version because I prefer Japanese, and sure, they come in nice boxes with pretty, shiny inserts, but don't judge a DVD by its cover.

Some subs are DIC (G-rated, but at least readable.), some Pioneer (Better translation, but incredibly hard to read font, and a majority of the series is this way), and Sailor Stars, the BEST season of them all is a homemade translation of subs with missing dialogue, questionable dialogue where it doesn't belong, and disc 3 even has some of the video footage missing!!!

I can't believe someone is charging so much for this. I can't believe I paid it!!!

I doth care about the rights or licensing, I just want to enjoy this series, that means so very much to me. You're better of downloading a torrent, because that's all this is; It's just in a shiny package...",1389139200,3,871,4.636363636363637

862597,5,6304404859,"We're almost at the end, & I have to admit that when not compared to the manga, this is the best volume quality-wise.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from WikiMoon.

158.  The Secret of Pegasus!  The Handsome Guardian of the Dream World:  PallaPalla's magic causes Usagi and Chibiusa to switch ages, turning Usagi into a child and Chibiusa into a teenager.  While Chibiusa is thrilled with her new body, she is distressed to discover that she can no longer call Pegasus.  This is an excellent episode that basically brought the season back to life in my eyes.  It also had one of the two remles summoned by the Quartet that was actually cool.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention how much I hated the last 7 remles.  The idea of freaks with animal heads for chests sounded interesting, but for the most part I hated them.  Some were so bad they wouldn't even make good Power Rangers monsters.  A+

159.  Chibiusa's Little Rhapsody of Love:  As Chibiusa becomes even more enamored of Helios, Usagi and her friends realize that she is in love, and are determined to discover the identity of her crush.  A

160.  Dream To Be An Adult!  The Amazoness' Bewilderment:  Usagi and her friends, along with the Amazoness Quartet, assist in the organization of a coming-of-age ceremony.  A

161.  Coming Terror!  The Dark Queen's Evil Approach:  Intent on escaping her mirror, Queen Nehellenia causes spider webs to appear all over the city, casting it into darkness.  A

162.  The Center of Darkness:  The Dead Moon Circus:  The Sailor Senshi infiltrate the Dead Moon Circus and are confronted by Zirconia.  A+

163.  Labyrinth of Mirrors!  Chibi Moon Captured:  After being captured by Queen Nehellenia, Sailor Chibi Moon confronts the evil queen.  A

Despite me going on about how the manga is better, you should be able to tell from these reviews that I still greatly enjoy this season.  I will however discuss the comparison in full when I review Volume 7.",1383177600,,1960,4.723214285714286
862598,5,6304404859,"So now we come to Volume 2 of SuperS & it's still good, though not as good as the first volume.  Here's a review of the episodes with synopsizes from WikiMoon.

134.  Makoto's Friendship!  A Girl Who adores a Pegasus:  Usagi and Chibiusa are excited to discover that a best-selling book was written by an old friend of Makoto's.  Makoto is my favorite of the Inner Senshi, so I love most of the episodes focused on her and this is no exception.  A+

135.  Hearts That Communicate!  Chibiusa and Pegasus:  Tiger's Eye targets Chibiusa's art teacher in the hopes of attacking Pegasus and finding his host.  Not the best epsiode, but it was good.  B

136.  Protect Mamoru!  Jealousy of Usagi the Ninja:  Mamoru moves into the Hikawa Shrine after his apartment is wrecked, so Usagi assumes the guise of a ninja to protect his honor.  This probably is the worst episode of Sailor Moon I have ever seen.  There's some funny moments with Diana & Tiger's Eye, but they're not nearly enough to redeem the stupid & embarrassing plot.  F

137.  Forest of Illusion!  Invitation of a Beautiful Fairy:  Chibiusa befriends Kitakata, an artist obsessed with fairies. Meanwhile, Fisheye prepares to seduce Kitakata by disguising himself (or herself, if you watch the English dub) as a beautiful fairy.  Okay, I'll be honest with you; I like Fisheye better as a girl in the anime.  I don't really feel comfortable watching his episodes in Japanese, so I just watch them in English.  And apart from one episode on the next volume I think they did a really good job dubbing them.  A pity the quality didn't carry over to more of the other episodes.  A

138.  Drive To Heaven!  Love Riding on the Car of Dreams:  Ami befriends Mamoru's colleague Natsumi, a widow who is trying to restore a classic car.  Pretty good.  B+

139.  Try For the Best of Japan!  The Worries of a Beautiful Girl Swordsman:  A young girl with dreams of being the strongest swordsman in Japan is targeted by Tiger's Eye.  Apart from episode 136, I like any episode with Tiger's Eye, & this was one of the best.  It was really unique.  I think Miharu was the only victim of the week who wasn't a recurring character to actually help fight a remles.  A+

Like I said; good but not as good as the first volume.  We still have 2 more volumes to go before the series really takes a nosedive.",1382572800,,2339,4.516826923076923

Seasons 1 and 2 were the only ones that were released in the states so when I found this box set with all 5 seasons (even though season 5 was never dubbed) along with the 3 movies, I was beyond stoked.

862601,5,6304404859,"Well here we are, the least popular season of Sailor Moon.  But don't let the ominous title of my review fool you.  In my opinion this is not the worst season, it's the second worst.  But it is the last season that's more good than bad.  Though I do prefer the manga, the first half of the anime is actually better than the manga in some parts, namely the portrayal of the Amazon Trio.  But I'll explain why over the next several reviews.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from WikiMoon.

128.  Meeting of Fate!  The Night Where a Pegasus Flies:  During a solar eclipse, a mysterious floating circus tent appears in the sky over Tokyo. Meanwhile, Chibiusa is fascinated by a Pegasus who appears to her in a dream.  Apart from the big error of nobody noticing the tent (I had seen other episodes before this one & assumed that it had an invisibility spell around it or something like that) this is a perfect start to the season.  A

129.  Super Transformations Again!  Pegasus' Power:  When Reika returns from Africa, Usagi becomes concerned that she and Motoki are having relationship problems.  Meanwhile, Tiger's Eye selects Reika as a target.  It was great seeing Reika again.  A

130.  Protect a Mother's Dream!  New Attack For the Double Moon: When Ikuko (Sailor Moon's mother) is attacked by Hawk's Eye, Sailor Moon must once again rely on the mysterious Pegasus for assistance.  One of the worse Sailor Moon episodes.  Once Hawk's Eye shows up it isn't so bad, but the beginning is one of the most terrible moments I have ever witnessed in anything Sailor Moon.  D+

131. Capture The Pegasus!  The Amazon's Trap:  When Hawk's Eye announces he has designed a system to trap Pegasus, Tiger's Eye approaches Naru with the intention of using her as bait.  Naru & Umion's last episode is excellent.  Certainly much better than their appearance in S.  A+

132.  A Couple Made For Each Other!  Usagi and Mamoru's Love:  Chibiusa worries that Saori, a friend of Mamoru's from college, is romantically interested in him.  One of the best episodes ever.  Great story, some hilarious moments, one of the coolest remles ever (Puko the Balloon Girl.  Seriously, I once saw a favorite remles thread on IMDB turn into we love Puko.), and to top it all off Mamoru gets to help beat a monster of the week in civilian form.  What more could you ask for?  A+

133.  Artemis' Affair!  A Mysterious Kitten Appears:  Rumors of Artemis' interest in other women spiral out of control after a small talking kitten appears, claiming that Artemis is her father.  It took a while for Diana to show up on the anime but it was worth the wait.  I guess the writers were just waiting until they could come up with a really good story, because this is one of the best episodes.  A+

Quite a good batch overall.  Sadly unlike the last 3 seasons the quality will get worse as the series goes on.  But I'll discuss the pros and cons of the series so far.  For starters, I thought the Dead Moon Circus was overall better in the anime than in the manga.  In the manga, the remles just look like black balls with eyes.  Kind of creepy, but not very interesting.  In the anime...  Those things in the tent creep the living daylights out of me.  For the most part the monsters of the week are nowhere near as frightening, but usually they're still very creative.  Some are kind of lame, but most are at least fairly threatening or funny and even some of the funny ones are only funny this side of the screen.  Coupled with their origin story (which was a lot more interesting in the anime than in the manga, despite how badly they botched the resolution in the Stars anime) they make for one of my top 3 SM monster of the week types.  Also greatly improved was the Amazon Trio.  In the manga, they show up in the first chapter then in every chapter after that one of them died until by the end of 4th chapter they were all dead.  Needless to say they were pretty boring.  In the anime however, they were awesome.  Even if the rest of the episode sucks it's always entertaining to see them discussing who the victim of the week should be & performing (thespian villains are always entertaining).  While I've heard some people complain the writers used Tiger's Eye too much (he's got more episodes than Hawk's Eye and Fish Eye combined) he's definitely my favorite of the 3 so I'm not annoyed.  I have to admit, I really liked this setup.  I honestly could have watched more of it.  Maybe if they had given a few more filler episodes to the Trio the manga could have gotten far enough ahead so that the later part of this season could have mirrored it more.  But we'll discuss that shortcoming later.  The only real shortcoming here is how much they focus on Chibiusa.  It's not the focus that's so bad it's that the writers dumbed down Usagi to make her look good.  But apart from the scene where Usagi throws a tantrum for not getting any pie in the third episode, there isn't anything unforgiveable here, but there will be more instances as this season goes on.  Let me just finish this by saying that no matter what this is definitely a great volume & you should at least try it.",1381449600,,5163,4.487068965517241
862602,5,6304404859,"I have to admit, S is excellent, but I prefer the first 2 seasons because Tuxedo Mask was more prominent in them than in S.  But it's still better than the manga, if you ask me.

In this season our heroines face the Death Busters, led by the mad scientist Professor Tomoe and several very lovely assistants known as the Witches 5.  With the help of manmade creatures known as Diamon, they intend to look through and snatch people's hearts for a very insidious scheme.  But to help offset this new threat, we meet Sailor Uranus & Sailor Neptune.  First of all, this is overall a great season.  The new characters really expanded the story possibilities, and the villains are great.  Professor Tomoe is hilarious, the Witches 5 were all interesting characters, even the ones who were only around for one episode and the Diamon are the greatest SM monsters of the week ever.  Nearly all of them were very creative.  Also noteworthy is that this was the first of 2 seasons to be dubbed uncut, & while not superior to the original it's still a better dub than DIC's, even if some of the new voices aren't as good.  The only thing I didn't like about this season was Uranus and Neptune's... relationship.  Why did they have to make them lesbians?  It really annoyed me when I saw Haruka wearing a cross.  How could she be a Christian & a lesbian?  It doesn't make sense!  But for the most part it's not discussed, and the episodes that do mention it are either terrible or watchable in English (which is very fortunate as some key episodes like the 2 part story where Sailor Moon turns 15 and the one where the talismans are revealed feature such references), since in the dub they are cousins & not lovers.  I know that seems strange, but it's my world.  You don't have to live in it.

I honestly like the anime infinitely better than the manga this time.  I'm sorry, but the Infinity Arc is my least favorite in the manga.  Aside from the explicit lesbian references, the villains with the exception of Pharaoh 90 were so boring & their anime counterparts had them all beat, especially Professor Tomoe.  In the manga, he was just a cold, ruthless villain who died, leaving his daughter an orphan.  Here, he was kind, caring person who let himself be possessed to save his daughter.  Again, I liked this change better because with it came a personality.  He became one of my favorite villains because he was so funny.  And I loathed the Haruka/Usagi parts in the manga so much!  She actually considered going with her instead of Mamoru at one point!  Thank God the anime reduced this horrible subplot to one episode.

So yeah, make what you will of my viewing decisions.  Either way, you have to admit this is a great season.  Sadly, this is the last real victory the anime will claim over the manga.  Tune in next time, when the shark bites Sailor Moon & unlike many fans I felt it never let go.  In fact, 2 seasons from now it will only bite harder.  But that will be covered over my next 6 or 7 reviews (I don't have the SuperS box set, just volumes 1-3 & 6-7 on DVD).",1381363200,,3066,4.437275985663082

You guys get ready to hang out with your best friends. Sailor Moon always welcomes you into to her world with open arms.

Doom Trees Series: Everything flows really well this season. It has amazing characterization moments for each of the group and storylines develop in a mature way. Our team moves forward in finding out what their identities as heroines and heroes. They even discover new powers. Each girl gets her own episodes to shine. This season leads to an unexpected yet awesome conclusion.

What is great is that you get a chance to notice that each of the girls: Serena, Amy, Raye Lita, Mina, and Darien have matured and continue to grow with Luna/Artemis teachings to help guide them. All in all its a fun season to watch for good character and power development.

I think DIC did a really good job dubbing these episodes. I am a fan of theirs, I respect the dubb because they brought us this amazing show in North America in the 90s, the dubb has its own cool vibe and take on the story that attracted me to it years ago.

***SPOILER WARNING***

* Molly's Folly - Molly (Naru) falls in love with Maxfield Stanton, to the concern of Serena (Usagi) and her friends. When Molly is caught by her mother stealing a jewel from her mom's safe, Serena believes Maxfield (aka Nephlite) is up to something...

* A Friend in Wolf's Clothing - Nephlite reveals his true identity to Molly, and tries to attack Sailor Moon from afar by figuring out her identity. When Molly gets kidnapped by the Negaverse (Dark Kingdom) monsters, Nephlite swings in to save her, but he is killed in the process, to Molly's mourning...

* Jupiter Comes Thundering In - Serena befriends a new transfer student at school named Lita Kino (Makoto Kino/Mako-chan), a girl who loves to fight and often talks about old boyfriends. Meanwhile, Queen Beryl sends Zoisite to seek out the 7 Rainbow Crystals, fragments of the Silver Crystal hidden within ordinary civilians. When Zoisite retrieves the first crystal from a man named Game Machine Joe, he mutates to a monster. When Lita tries to help Sailor Moon, Luna gives her the power to transform to the powerful Sailor Jupiter. (NOTES: Sailor Moon is also given the Crescent Moon Wand/Moon Stick in this episode; this was Tracey Moore's final episode playing Serena)

* The Power of Friendship - Molly continues to mourn Nephlite's death, so Serena and Melvin (Umino) try to cheer her up. When Molly tries asking a man in a cementary for advice, she meets up with Zoisite, and tries to fight her off. Meanwhile, Amy (Ami), Raye (Rei), and Lita are discussing if Serena should be allowed to keep the Crescent Moon Wand.

* Mercury's Mental Match - Amy becomes friends with a new kid named Greg Urawa (Ryo Urawa), who has a mysterious ability to predict the future. He also learns that Amy is Sailor Mercury, but this knowledge is cut short when he predicts he will be attacked by Zoisite for the next Rainbow Crystal.

* An Artful Attack - Serena and Darien (Mamoru), still disliking each other (for now), go to model for an artist named Peggy Jones (Yumemi Yumeno), who went by an alias name of Lonnie Lenai when she bombed on her first painting. When Peggy gets attacked by Zoisite, and her Rainbow Crystal is extracted, the Sailor Scouts and Tuxedo Mask go to stop Zoisite, but when Sailor Moon asks Tuxedo Mask to give her a Rainbow Crystal, he refuses; leaving Sailor Moon in distrust over Tuxedo Mask...

They meet Serena's mother who had passed away on the Moon Kingdom in order to protect them all. This causes them to be sent into the future to be reborn and have normal lives. Which isn't so normal because the Negaverse comes.

One thing I would have improved was the ending battle. I feel as though they fought their way to this very point and then....the battle was like 3 minutes then it just ended.

* Nightmare in Dreamland - A local amusement park called Dreamland is under suspicions when people are said to have disappeared at the park. It is believed the Negaverse is involved. Meanwhile, Serena and Raye must learn to stop arguing, and work together to fight the Negaverse.

Now for a review of what's on this dvd volume.
  This volume contains the last 5 episodes of the second season-Sailor Moon R,but just entitled Sailor Moon by ADV.
  Contains English EDITED episodes 78-82/ORIGINALLY episodes 85-89. SEE NOTE ABOVE.
The episodes are as seen below.

EPISODES

  English Episode 78-""Birth Of Wicked Lady""
Wiseman kidnaps Rini and brainwashes her to think that nobody loves her. He then uses his magic to the make her older, creating her dark alter-ego, Wicked Lady, and then uses her to open a Dark Portal in present-day Tokyo.

  English Episode 79-""Brotherly Love""
Saphire discovers the truth regarding Wiseman's ultimate plan, forcing him to escape to the past where the former Negamoon Sisters(who were healed by Sailor Moon) discover him. But Wiseman tracks him down and kills him before he can warn his brother of the true evil.

  English Episode 80-""Diamond In The Rough""
The Sailor Scouts enter the growing Dark Crystal to stop the Wiseman,but Sailor Moon is abducted one more time by Prince Diamond. After finally helping him realize what is really going on, Diamond sacrifices himself to allow her to save the present and future.

  English Episode 81- ""Final Battle""
The Sailor Scouts attempt to prevent the Dark Gate from opening,but Wicked Lady appears and attacks them. Sailor Moon tries to use the power of the Silver Crystal to show Wicked Lady her true memories. After a while, Wicked Lady turns back into Rini. Doom Phantom(Wiseman's Tue form)opens the Dark Gate to attack the Earth,and Sailor Moon must fight. Rini cries and her tear forms the Silver Crystal of the future. Together, Sailor Moon and Rini overpower the Doom Phantom,destroying him and the black Crystal forever. Later, Rini returns to the future.

  English Episode 82-""Follow The Leader""
A recap of the previous seasons as well as a preview for the next. The Sailor Scouts argue over who will be the new main character during the voice overs.

VIDEO QUALITY

Video Quality actually seems better for their OFFICIAL English EDITED version Volumes 12-14+last episode of Volume 11*,than for the previous 11 English EDITED volumes.
*English EDITED episodes 66-82/Originally episodes 73-89

Video Quality for English EDITED version Volumes 12-14+last episode of Volume 11* also look much better in comparison  to the same episode footage they released in it's ""allegedly"" UNCUT format released as the OFFICIAL Season 2 UNCUT Japanese Language Subtitled version  8 disc Boxset.
*English EDITED episodes 66-82/Originally episodes 73-89

Just so you know,it was NOT uncut!
Not only was their ""uncut"" season 2 subtitled boxset missing episode 67,but all the episodes were missing the next episode prieviews and ADV put the current episode preview after the opening song+titles (when they should be first!).
Not to mention no extras like Clean openings and Closings for all different Openings+Closings and 15 second episode previews.

AUDIO QUALITY

Audio Quality for this dvd is Good.

English EDITED episodes 66-82 seem to match the quality if not better than English EDITED episodes 1-65 that were placed on the first 11 English EDITED volumes.
I honestly can't remember if it's better than the previous 65 English EDITED episodes,as I haven't watched them in a while.

But if they are,that probaly has to do with the fact that English EDITED episode 65 aired November 21,1995.
Sailor Moon then went on Haiatus in the USA.The remaining episodes (not including the one that was OMITTED),weren't aired until years later-English EDITED episode 66 airing on December 1,1998 and picking up where the series left off,not to air English EDITED Episode 82 until December 22,1998,thus concluding the second English EDITED season of Saior Moon-known to TRUE Sailor Moon FANS as SAILOR MOON R.

MENU DESIGN

Menu Design leaves much to be desired.

The first 3 episodes are on the far left of the screen.
The remaining 2 episodes as well as the ADV previews are on the far right of the screen. All episodes are listed in a vertical pattern that waves like the following ( ),each episode under the one that it's after.

In between the episode list is the matching picure of Neo Queen Serenity/Sailor Moon's future self in front of the US Sailor Moon TM Logo and the title of the dvd ""Love Conquers All"" placed in front of her white dress low enough that it doesn't clash.
The mini sailor on the right,Sailor Mini Moon is not on the menu.

Also each episode is represented by a hollowed out star with a very short visual portion of the contained episode playing the same short bit inside the enclosed star.

An example is below. However instead of using the whole episode title,I'm just going use the episode number. The ( )'s I use will each represent the episode enclosed stars mentioned above. I will also abbreviate the ADV previews to PR.Also ignore the undelines. Those are just used to take up space to make the formula appear on screen. Pretend they're not even there.

_(78)____________________(81)_______________________________________________________________________________________
(79____QUEEN PICTURE_____ (82)___________________________________________________________________________________
_(80_____________________(PR)______________________________________________________________________________________

You can select the episode you want to play by using the arrow keys on your DVD or BLU RAY remote control.

However,say you choose to view a certain episode say#80. Once that episode ends it will continue on playing the remaining episodes.
So if you wanted to start on the first episode of the disc after viewing said #80,you would have to use your remote to go to the MAIN MENU to select said first episode.

Each episode is broken up into chapters,but there's nowhere on the menu you can access a certain episode's specific chapter like you can on the Sailor Moon S and SuperS Volumes by Pioneer/Geneon.
If you want to view it,you'll have to remember which one it is and select the episode on the main menu and then either SKIP ahead to the desired chapter with the Skip button on your remote or if you remember what number it is,for example chapter 3 of 6 then just hit the #3 digit on your remote.

Each episode is broken into 6 chapters. They are listed below.

Chapter 1:Current Episode Preview
Chapter 2:Theme Song
Chapter 3:Part A
Chapter 4:Part B
Chapter 5:Sailor Says/Educational Advice
Chapter 6:Theme Song Reprise and Credits

When you select ADV Previews,it takes you to another section of the dvd for ADV trailers.

The setup follows the same principals and is similar to the menu design except,On the far left is a picture of Wicked Lady and the previews are in the middle to the far left of the screen in front of the US Sailor Moon TM Logo.

Again I will provide an example of what it looks like as well as the titles of the previews.
I will use the same formula as before in my explanation/diagram keeping with the new changes to the screen.

*I'm assuming they put this here to make sure you check out their website. For the consumer's reference.

DISC/LABEL ART

Disc/label art on this Volume frankly should've been done better.

The picture matches the dvd case art,however,unlike Volume 1 (EP.1-6) and 2 (EP.7-12),it looks like in an attempt to save money at the consumer's expense,they did a half ass job on the label itself.

They didn't use a full disc label. They didn't even do what they chose to do the discs on my copies of Volumes 3-6 (EP.13-30) which saved them money but didn't look half ass.

Discs 1 and 2 still look best and come in first place as to the look,value,and effort put in (you can't get fingerprint smudges on the top of the disc due to PROPER labeling (non corporate greed).

My copies of discs 3-6 come in second place as they were done in a way for the company to save money but still looked appealiing and that they had put some effort in.
(There's NOT a full picture label however they did it so you can put it n and out of the case and NOT get fingerprint smudges on the front label)

My copies of discs 7-14 (EP.31-82) come in LAST place and I think after Vol. 6 they just got greedy as a corporation because my remaining Volumes all look the same-like ADV stopped putting in any effort all to save a $ on the millions of dvds they produced.

How they did an even more half ass job is listed below.
There again is no full disc label,but this time the surface on top of the disc is this UGLY thing/surface that's impossible not to touch and not leave fingerprint smudges when you take it in and out of the case.
It'll probably look worse over time since you have to use a soft shirt or someting to wipe them off after you've put it back in the case. After time that wiping takes it's toll on the surface.
A full picture artwork label would resolve this problem.

UPDATE:3/8/12
I just looked at a second copy of discs 3-6 that I'm going to give my friend for a gift,and SURPRISE!,those copies I have reserved for him have been manufactured the same half ass way as MY 3rd place discs 7-14!
Apparently,NOT ALL COPIES ARE CREATED/MANUFACTURED EQUALLY!

DVD SLIPCASE ARTWORK DESIGN

DVD Slipcase artwork Design leaves a lot to be desired as well.

The only real decent picture you get is Neo Queen Serenity on the front.
The little sailor next to her-Mini Moon doesn't even belong as that character isn't even in this season!
Rini is Sailor Mini Moon and she shows up as a Sailor Scout in training in the next season,Sailor Moon S Episode 103.*

*This season (Sailor Moon S) was not dubbed into English until 2000,three years after the last episodes of the previous series. By this time,the license had gone to Cloverway Inc.,who did not cut any episodes,although they did edit the ones they produced for television and edited VHS releases (the later DVD releases of these episodes were MOSTLY uncut/still missing next episode previews and bilingual).The English dub used mostly the same voice actors from the previous seasons,however,several major characters were recast with new voice actors.
The educational ""Sailor Says"" conclusions were not continued,and the dubbed episode numbers were adjusted by the YTV to match those of the original Japanese version. Because of this,episode numbers 83-89 were never used in that broadcast.

CHAPTER ARTWORK INSERT DESIGN

Chapter Artwork Insert Design leaves much to be desired as well.

ADV's problem this time is repetition.

You get the same picture of Neo Queen Serenity on one side of the insert as the dvd menu,dvd slipcase artwork,and dvd label!

Then they repeat the process some more!
On the other side of the insert is the same picture of Wicked Lady that you get on the ADV Previews menu.

And ADV is still not done giving you more of the same pictures!
That picture of Sailor Mini Moon that doesn't belong that you got on the dvd slipcase artwork,tries to compete with the Future Queen of Crystal Tokyo for space on the dvd disc label as well!

DVD CASE

Dvd case is good these were done before the post-recycle dvd container thing of now.

Dvd's and Blu-rays now come in cases that are far lighter. The reason being there's less plastic in them-Don't believe me take a look the next time you buy one.

Usually behind the disc or the where an insert goes,sections of the plastic are cut out.
Where the insert goes it's in the shape of the 3 circular arrows that signify Recycle.
Behind the disc a whole bunch is missing.

It's made that way to for some reason I can't fathom.

Personally I think it's stupid,as I then have to spend even more money on a better solid case.

  VOICE CASTING and ACTING

Voice Choices

Personally I don't know why SM fans hate the English dubbed version.
I think they did a Super Special Awesome Job!
Not to mention if it wasn't for the English version,I and many grateful Sailor Moon Fans accross the USA would quite possibly NEVER have been introduced/exposed to Sailor Moon (in any form) at all!

Granted in this Volume,I take it they couldn't get some of the the actors/actresses that did a better job and just settled or didn't make them do take after take until they produced something similar to what we've grown to love.

Examples I noticed are below.

1. Sailor Mars
Emilie Barlow voiced her in the remaining 17 episodes of season 2,filling in for Katie Griffin who primarily voiced her for the majority of the series but was unfortunately filming a movie at the time. I say unfortunately because Katie just did the better job and fit the character better.

2. Tuxedo Mask
Rino Romano voiced him in episodes 1-11. Rino Ramano did a better job as this character than Vince Corazza.

Toby Proctor the actor who voiced him in episodes 12-65,did the best job and just fit the character best. He should've been used for the remainder of the English Dubb+the movies instead of Vince Corazza.

Vince Corazza voiced him in this dvd as well as episodes 66-159(The 17 remaing R episodes,entire S and SupreS seasons+the R,S and SuperS movies. Vince Corazza was the least suited to voice this character of the three actors to voice him.

3. Artemis
Ron Rubin voiced him throughout the entire series,but while watching this dvd,maybe since it had been a while from the time they recorded episode 65 and eipsode 66 let alone these episodes 78-82,he'd just not been in practice or something as he didn't sound the same as the Artemis I'd come to love from episodes 33-65 (His original run).

4. Wiseman
Tony Daniels voiced this character throughout their entire run.
However,I feel he fell into the same trap performance wise as Ron Rubin-See Artemis above for details.

EXTRAS

There are no extras,unless you count and/or consider the ADV previews mentioned earlier.
However,seeing as this is a Sailor Moon dvd and there are NO Sailor Moon extras of anykind,I'm very disappointed.

They could have provided special Exclusive Sailor Moon Trailers.
Some examples of good trailer ideas they could have used are  below.

1. OFFICIAL Bandai and Irwin Sailor Moon product commericals for all toys.
I've never seen any of the commercials for the dolls or toys produced by Irwin,But Bandai did air some on local televison as I saw some of them growing up.

2. OFFICIAL advertisments for the Sailor Moon English EDITED anime for local and cable networks.
Again,I remember the networks would have these advertisements to promote/advertise the show while it was on their newtwork.
The following examples below are ACTUAL ads that were on tv. The cahhel numbers and stations are the ACTUAL ones they were aired on in accrdance to where I was living at the time.

Ex.#1
Random action scenes and sequences from the show are being played throughout the entire time the announcer is speaking. The announcer says,""Sailor Moon,and the Sailor Scouts battle the world's baddest villans,weekday mornings only on UPN 13"".

Ex.#2

Ex.#3
This one is harder to describe,but it was aired on and for the Action Extreme Team [...]

3 STAR RATING JUSTIFICATION

The series itself is 5 stars,however my review of 3 stars pertains to criteria listed within this review.
In other words,it's based on the product itself/what ended up being produced and how much effort ADV put into it.

When you do do something,DO IT RIGHT,NOT HALF ASS,trying to save yourself money by cutting corners and screwing the consumer!

That's the problem with a lot of companies,they get greedy and they're only concerned with making money/a profit while saving as much as they can in the process/cutting corners,no effort or thought put into something etc.. and as soon as they see money coming in,they always seem to lose their moral compass or just choose to ignore it.

WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS?

Yes,I would  highly recommend this.
If you like good CLASSIC anime-Get SAILOR MOON!
It's one of the BEST ANIMES ever made. You and your kids won't regret it.

(English EDITED version for seasons 1&2 until they release an UNCUT boxset for both that's actually UNCUT and has decent picture and sound,read the 1&2 star reviews on Amazon)

APOLOGY

I sincerly apologize if this review was long,but I wanted to do what I felt was an honest accurate review.
It's my first OFFICIAL review that's been revamped in the the way that I want to start doing my reviews.",1257120000,,18056,5.070074475287745
863288,5,6304404859,"The DVD arrived in a timely fashion, and it was in great condition as stated by the seller.",1257120000,,91,4.111111111111111
863289,3,6304404859,"I own this and it's okay...not as good as it could be if DiC had dubbed the season but other then that it's a really good, A one disc DVD with 6 episodes, both the original Japanese Audio and the English dubbed audio and Japanese English translated subtitles (for the Japanese Audio), all the episodes are restored to their Japanese original length with scenes and the commercial breaks restored back into the show and only one worth while extra of the Japanese Opening Version 2. This is Volume 4 not 7 & 8 I don't know who put the title on here but it needs corrected it's not Vol 7 & 8. The correct title should be Sailor Moon S Heart Collection Vol. 4 not what you see. Sorry to those who think it's a 2 disc set when it's not it's just a one disc set that's an error title on their part. Sadly you can't buy this in stores anymore unless it's used because Toei, the creators of the anime in Japan and owners of the North American branch Cloverway, Inc. who dubbed this season and SuperS, has a lockdown on the licensing and because the North American licensing has lapsed these are no longer being made and distributed to stores. The only other place you can get these used is here on the internet but the prices on for this season are way to expensive because of the title and should be lowered to prices around those of SuperS. Please be sure to note this is Vol. 4 not 7 & 8 and think you're gonna get 2 DVD's in one cause your not. It's Sailor Moon S Heart Collection Vol. 4 with only 1 disc and 6 episodes.

NOTE: This Uncut version of the show may contain scenes that are inappropriate for children under the age of 13. If you're a parent and you are wanting to buy this for your child so they can see what you grew up watching who is under the age of 13, don't. You are better off buying the VHS TV Edit's of the show (VHS's that are uncut will say uncut on them as well as on the title used if bought on amazon) it'll be more suitable for children 7-12. Sadly the VHS's are the only way to get the TV edits of the show :(.",1254614400,,2035,4.113065326633166

Be wary from whom/where you buy your box sets. I've found that not all descriptions are completely accurate. It's best when they provide their own actual photos of the product.

I think that I should have the entire series on dvds for this outrageous price.

Considering the price... I am happy with the product although I don't find much special features. I don't care much anyway, I love this season of Sailor Moon",1234137600,2,599,3.9916666666666667

-tuxedo unmasked
  the evil prince darien (endimeon) is capturing the former rainbow crystal holders so beryl can combine them and make in invicible warrior

-a reluctant princess
  serena (usagi) now knows that she is the princess of the moon princess serenity. but she has doubts about herself, and about being the moon princess. i really loved thie episode becuase in most show or cartoons the character will just accept what ever you tell them and be ok with being a super powerfull king or what ever. but serena (usagi) knows that there is more to the situation than that. and she worres about her friends.

-bad hair day
  mina (minako) trys to cheer up serena (usagi) by bringing her to get a makeover at a new local salon. but it endsup being a trap set up by the negaverse. i think one of the cutest parts of this episode is when they show serena (usagi) with different hairstyels in the back of as serena (usagi) and Mina (minako) talk.

-little miss manners
  serena (usagi) wants to be a better princess so she gets into a finishing school. this again turns out to be a trap set by the negaverse. this episode was filled with so many funny parts. i think the best part was the dance.

863442,5,6304404859,"Many Sailor Moon fans tend to agree that 'Sailor Moon S' is one of the best and the finest among the five entertaining Sailor Moon television series.

This may be because of the engaging comedy, as well as the sometimes clever twists and turns of the serious drama within the story arc. There are also the continued fine tuning of the characters as they must face new conflicts with the arrival of the two rebellious outer sailor soldiers: Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus (Michiru and Haruka). Also intermixed in  this series is the charming and dramatic story of friendship between the two little girls Chibiusa (Chibi-moon) and Hotaru Tomoe (Sailor Saturn), and their inner conflicts as they and the other sailor soldiers must face  their powerful new nemesis, the Death Busters (Professor Tomoe, Kaolinite, Eudial, Mistress 9, and others).

All this material is weaved almost effortlessly into a sweeping and engaging dramatic series: the spectacular battles against the Diamohn forces outside Mugen Academy, and the final confrontation between Sailor Moon, Mistress 9, and Pharoah 90 are some of the most dark, dynamic, and dramatic scenes of action and intense drama ever in the Sailor Moon film series.

Overall, the comedy, drama, and excitement of this series is just another example of the art of storytelling and cinema that was understood by its filmmakers that, unknown to them at the time it was successfully produced in Japan, also had wide universal appeal that would easily carry the show overseas to engage viewers around the world.

The Sailor Moon S series is simply one of the best examples of why anime caught on with viewers and other filmmakers around the world. It is successfully and engagingly strong on human drama, comedy, action, and adventure.

Intro

Sailor Mooon aired in Japan in 1992. It ended in 1997 with 200 episodes. It's about normal girls turning into magical warriors and fighting evil.

It came to U.S in 1995 and sucked badly. The dub was loved but sucked.

DVD:

This DVD has great features , picture , options and presentation.

Series: The sailor warriors are back fighting the death busters, trying to awaken  the ""messiah"" of silence. Our sailor warriors search for three talismans and stop pure hearts from being taken.

I love this season. Full of drama , suspense , action , and the music is wonderful. the plot is dark and deep and the characters are so unique. Add this to your sailor moon collection.",1172534400,,729,4.553846153846154
863597,5,6304404859,"Yes, we all know Sailor Moon S is an amazing season. It's full of action, comedy, storyline(most important) and in-depth character development. So why the negative comments? Before I talk about Sailor Moon S and why it's great, let me counter everything the bashers and critics think.

Sailor Moon is, was and always will be a legend in the anime business. I don't know how people can evade this truth. There's no anime in the business more well known than Sailor Moon in the states other than Dragon Ball Z. I would say Speed Racer, but that's way before the common Otaku's time to enjoy. Also, I would say Pokemon, but it was a fad with a storyline that I fear will never end. Dragon Ball Z is the only anime that really stood with Sailor Moon in terms of legend status. The 90s were the golden years of anime, and these two were the biggest names out there that got people to like anime. Ranma, Tenchi, Slayers, Gundam Wing eventually fell into people's laps after fans of SM and DBZ started ""experimenting"" and you know it's true. I've heard this countless times from long-term Otaku for over 2 decades now.

Now which do I prefer? I saw Dragon Ball first back in the late 80s, but once again, didn't think much of it. It didn't really make me believe, it was just like any other show. It didn't help that I wasen't into anime yet. When I saw Sailor Moon in 1994, that was it, I fell in love with it. The story was moving, they had a new monster everyday(unlike modern day anime, where you see the same monster and enemy for 100 episodes) and it taught me alot in terms of respect, love, and friendship. You can't tell me an anime that ""sucks"" can reach out like that? Think before you say. The only things Full Metal Alchemist taught me is how to be down on myself. The only thing DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, Naruto taught me is how to start fights. The only thing Fooly Cooly, Negima!?, and Neon Genesis Evangelion taught me is to ignore plot in anime and think it's cool anyway. The logic for modern day anime fans is thus: ""I don't understand what the characters are doing/saying, nor do I care about them. But it was random and zany, and will make great pairing fanfics and deviant art so......YAY""  OH! I forgot, that's most of you out there.

Sailor Moon was bashed on for being repeative and not as exciting as say....Trigun? Trigun came out during the golden years of anime *claps* good for Trigun. However, it's fans were always jealous of the stronger popularity that Sailor Moon has, and what a landmark it made. Trigun(to me) was slow, boring, insulting, and not my type of anime. The theme of the nature of morality is cliche and nothing new. After watching Dragon Ball Z, it's hard for any action anime to sell. In short, Vash is not Goku. DBZ had no plot either, and is probably the biggest filler anime in history. But at least it's action sold well and that's all that matters. Someone also mentioned Full Metal Alchemist? Please to the extreme on that one. Alchemist drags on and never appealed to me, period. Characters like Winry or Lust were nice, but they could never save the shipwreck of an anime from sleep powder boredom. I guess the Otaku of the modern day(all these 12-16 years olds getting into anime) are different and love what they see on TV which is targeted at the male crowd. More girls love Naruto and Alchemist than Doremi or Tokyo Mew Mew and that's a shame. Mew Mew and Doremi have the unrealistic ""happiness"" tone to it, guess we're growing into an angst world? Sailor Moon definately has the right messages in it's anime and manga, that really makes for good entertainment. But the common male, tomboy or fanboy doesn't wanna hear it. They want a hero that's ruthless and has a heart made of stone. A hero that can get out of control and cause destruction. Hell, they want a heroine that can murder countless millions and still be respected because she was never evil to begin with. I don't know about you all, but if anyone in my 20+ years of watching anime defines the term hero it's Usagi. By the way, Sailor Moon the weakest in the group? Watch closely, burn your eyes out until you've seen all 200 episodes. Then have the guts to tell me again, if Usagi is still the weakest. Fanboys have always played hide and seek from the fact that Usagi's CHARACTER is a crybaby and not very smart. She always does her routine with the weekly monster, but once provoked and once her 15 second ""I'm scared"" routine is over, you're dead. Sailor Moon is a walking plot device that can never lose, I don't care which character you bring up. That's how Goku earned his title of being the strongest male character in history. To reply to a older review, Uranus and Neptune KNEW they couldn't beat Sailor Moon if she got serious. After the crystal flash attack, they knew they were up against the true Messiah. It was a show of respect. What, did you expect Uranus and Neptune to blow up half the planet just to prove a point? Go to Studio 8, I think Vegeta is about to do something like that in a battle with Majin Buu. *sarcasm* Moron.

Now that my Shinji type rant is over, now to explain why Sailor Moon S is probably the best season of Sailor Moon(next to Sailor Stars in my opinion)Sailor Moon S takes a new turn, with new and better animation. The girls are drawn way better than they were in Classic and R. It's common that as the series progresses, the animation gets better. The storyline definately hit me this time. After the defeat of Wiseman in R(and possibly a day after Fiore was defeated) we have a new enemy in Dr. Tomoe. Allow me to tell you what makes the DeathBusters different than previous enemies.

Dark Kingdom- Gathering Energy to revive Queen Metallia to conquer Earth. Later on, seek the Silver Crystal for a faster revival.

Ail and Ann- Gathering energy for themselves and the Doom Tree to stay alive.

Black Moon- Destroy the Past and Future of Earth, and most of all gain the power of the silver crystal, unaware that 2 silver crystals(from the present and future)exist.

Dead Moon Circus- After the holder of the Golden Mirror with Pegasus. Once captured, Nehelenia will use the Golden Crystal to conquer the universe and keep her beauty.

Galaxia- Conquer the last Galaxy, collect Star Seeds of humans(the ultimate source of energy in the universe) and later on, destroy the universe.

Man, I must be watching different anime each time because they all have different missions. So what makes the Deathbusters different? They're out to seek the pure hearts of human beings, that'll be used to awaken the Messiah of Silence. Once that's done, the Messiah will summon their master- Pharaoh 90. A God from the Tau Ceti Star System, who'll destroy Earth and everything in space. The main theme here is apocolypse, the Deathbusters want everything to die and be destroyed. Very dark stuff, very nice improvement over Wiseman's plans to destroy the future. Uranus and Neptune start things off by appearing, and searching for the Tailsman. Once together, the Tailsman will make the Holy Grail appear and whoever holds the Grail, becomes the Savior of the Universe, plus become immortal. The Deathbusters only need it for Pharaoh 90's summoning, since it has enough power to bring it to Earth. Haruka and Michiru cause quite a stir as well when Hotaru Tomoe is introduced. Hotaru who juggles a life between herself, Sailor Saturn, and Mistress 9 cannot control what she does and destroys anyone who provokes her. You can feel Hotaru's pain as you watch the last few episodes of S, her friendship with Chibi-usa is a tragic one. You have to see it for yourself. When I first saw this season, I was blown away......I'm not even here! Man, you should see Sailor Moon's face after the battle with Pharaoh 90, while holding the newly reborn Hotaru. Freaking legendary, what ever happend in the core of 90's body, Usagi knew she went to Hell and back for Hotaru's safety. Once again, a true hero.

Sailor Moon S is a great season for Moonies and Otaku in general. Take a trip to a time when anime was truely #1 and watch one of the greatest anime by the greatest storyteller(Takeuchi-sama), in the history of japanese animation.

Other recommended titles: Fushigi Yuugi(the drama), Noir(the storyline), SuperGals(comedy), My-Hime(the next Sailor Moon),  Elfen Lied(the shock factor), Utena(the complexity), Angelic Layer(shorter than Pokemon, but more intelligent than that and Yu-Gi-Oh)

Sometimes Sailor Moon educates me on things like friendship and love. You can acutally learn something from watching Sailor Moon... and its not just all entertainment. If you are a hardcore Sailor Moon fan then this Season of Sailor Moon is a MUST BUY for you!!! I know you will enjoy this season as much as I did.

Sailor Moon S is also the darkest of the five seasons of Sailor Moon.  The deaths of the villains (Witches 5)are also very entertaining.

Okay, so that might be just a little extreme, but in all seriousness: coming from a (straight) guy, Sailor Moon is the absolute best anime series out there. Sailor Moon first debuted in 1992 as a product of the same creator of the uber-popular Sailor V series. Fast forward to the present.  Sailor Moon - every single episode of it - has been released on DVD for the world to fall in love with again.  The Sailor Scouts each represent one planet in the solar system (Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, etc.); the Inner Scouts are Sailors Mercury, Venus, Mars, Moon, and Saturn, named so because they are named after the inner planets (kudos to slave2moonlight for that little piece of information :) ).  I am 17 years old, a male, and I still absolutely love the Sailor series.  In fact, this is my current favorite DVD... and probably will remain so for a good while.  More reviews for Sailor Moon merchandise are coming later; until then, signing out, all you Sailor Scouts out there.

863796,2,6304404859,"Upon the end of Sailor Moon R somewhere back in 99' I was left with a gaping sense of emptiness after the finale (which I can't remember very well since it was a very long time ago). I was avid fan of Sailor Moon; the so-called Female ""Power Rangers"" show for girls, I loved everything about it. I didn't return to watching Toonami until March sixth which was the arrival of Gundam Wing) and afterward a new season of DBZ starting off with the Trunks saga. So you can I was surprised to find that Sailor Moon had returned with a new season as well. After they had taken her off the air completely I wasn't broken up too much about it. I had the TV-shows for boys (DBZ and GW, Superman, and Batman/Batman beyond, among other things) to watch and keep me happy.

On Christmas I received Sailor Moon S - Pure Hearts (Vol. 1, TV Version). I was excited to watch it again. But when I popped it into the VCR the glimmer of excitement and respect had fallen completely from me; they changed everything I had came to expected from this Shuojo-anime. Maybe the purists who don't mind editing were jumping in their seats upon hearing the original soundtrack from the Sailor Moon Uncut version, but I was pissed. They changed most of the voice actors for every character I either liked or thought was okay [AKA; Mina, Amy, Rini, Sailor Pluto, Serena, and Andrew] with second rate actors who try their best to mimic their past voice actors but fail miserably in every aspect.

Episodes about Serena and Rini aren't as interesting as they were in Sailor Moon/R; they have a little girl encouraging grown adults to never give up on love because if they do they might regret it for the rest of their lives (as if she knew anything about it being a C-H-I-L-D and all), Serena basically broods about everything concerning saving the world, blaming herself, jumping all over Darien, being the klutz she is and saving the day at the end of every episode. There is no longer an aspect of character development in this series. Episodes that are basically about everyone else are still as boring as ever because they're still the backup troopts and never destroy the monsters that attack people they know. When an enemy challenges Sailor Mars - Jupiter - Venus - and Mercury, they just weaken it and Sailor Moon does the rest of the killing, there basically is no new aspect to the four secondary characters powers or strengths.

The plot for Sailor Moon S isn't as gripping as the others although it is change from the regular Steal energy or crystals. This time the enemy wants pure hearts of a particular kind in order to achieve world domination and reawaken a long lost leader of theirs that lies dormant in the body of a small child named Hotaru, so they target everyone they possibly can, mostly people who are close to the sailor scouts until they discover that the pure-hearts they're searching for lay within two new Sailor scouts; Neptune and Uranus. Whom are lesbians in the uncut version *frowns* but cousins in the edited version, thankfully, but are unaware of the third holder of the crystal is Sailor Pluto --- Trista.

When these three items are combined they give Sailor Moon a new method of transforming along with new powers. But this new item drains Sailor Moon's energy everytime she uses it. Eventually the bad guys decide to rear their ugly heads and Kidnap Rini. The sailor Scouts head off to rescue the young girl but find themselves coming one-second too late for Rini's the holder of the purest heart (as well as, the pure-sweet energy, white mirror dream of Pegasus and so on). It is given to Hotaru's evil and it reawakens her split personality Mistress Nine: the sailor scouts try to stop her evil but are overpowered (Sailor Pluto is believed to be killed), Sailor Moon is the only one able to get inside the protective dome Mistress Nine has created around her fortress, Sailor Uranus and Neptune try with all their might to kill Mistress nine but find themselves constantly stopped but an ignorant Sailor Moon who practically helps Mistress nine destroy the world by giving her the sailor chalice in a vain attempt to save Hotaru.

When Mistress Nine gives the sailor Chalice to her master Pharaoh 90 she is supposedly doubled crossed the moment after thus creating a rifft between her control over the young Hotaru's spirit and body. Hotaru's positive side reawakens and destroys Mistress nine and is reborn as Sailor Saturn; the sailor scout of destruction. Without a second thought Sailor Saturn leaps into the heart of Pharaoh 90 and destroys him knowing that she will die as well but the sailor scouts (like always) surrender their powers to Sailor Moon who transforms without the sailor chalice and enters Pharaoh 90 as he is destroyed saving a reborn baby Hotaru's life. After that Sailor Uranus and Netpune object to Sailor Moon being their princess because they think of her as weak (and in so many ways, Sailor Moon is the weakest out of all the characters) but end up being beaten by Sailor Moon's bright-light from her broach (what a sucky way to be beated) and return to whever they came from.

All in all its a basic romp of Mix-pause-and-repeat, unstomachable and flimsy romances, lesbians, untalented English Voice acting, and loss of the spark that Made Sailor Moon, sailor moon. Maybe I've lost interest in Sailor Moon, but I do know one thing. The first season and other seasons before S -Super-S-and Stars were far better than this.

All I have to say is that if you're a Chibiusa/Rini hater please watch this season the whole way through and you might think differently of her.

Unfortunately, the peace doesn't last long as new enemies known as the Death Busters have appeared.  Led by the sinister scientist Professor Tomoe, the Death Busters send out their evil monsters, the Daimons, to search for the heart crystals which are found inside the bodies of pure-hearted people.  There are three heart crystals which posses special powers which, when combined, can form into the legendary Holy Grail, and depending on the heart of the person who uses it, the Holy Grail can be used to either save the earth or destroy it.  The only one powerful enough on the forces of evil who can use the Holy Grail's powers is the Messiah of Silence, and the only one powerful enough on the forces of justice that can use it is the true Messiah.  Two new mysterious Senshi, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, have appeared also searching for the talismans in order to save the world.  But they know that once the talismans have been found, those heart crystals cannot be returned to their original owners and they will die.  Uranus and Neptune are willing to take all risks to get the Holy Grail, but Usagi, naturally, doesn't want anyone to be hurt.  So, now the race is on.  The Sailor Senshi must find the Messiah who can save the earth from evil while trying to prevent the talismans from falling into the hands of both the Outer Senshi and the Death Busters, but can Sailor Moon really save the world on her own?  Who are the holders of the talismans and just who are these new Sailor Senshi?  Who is Sailor Saturn, the Senshi of Ruin, and what is her connection to Tomoe Hotaru, the mysterious daughter of Professor Tomoe?

The third season of Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon S, based on the Infinity Arc of the original manga, written and drawn by Takeuchi Naoko-san, is considered by many Sailor Moon fans to be the best out of the five seasons.  Indeed, the S season certainly is the most exiciting season, with the introduction of brand-new Sailor Senshi and featuring edge-of-your-seat plot twists.  Sailor Pluto and Chibi-usa also return for this season, as a senshi in training, Sailor Chibi Moon.  Unfortunately, her powers are weak compared to the other Senshi's, and while this does make for some amusing comedy relief, it gets old fairly fast after awhile.  We're also introduced to one of the newest and most mysterious of the Senshi, Sailor Saturn, who is actually a threat to both sides of the battle.  This season also has a darker atmosphere than what the first two seasons had, but the show never loses its comicial moments that have always put a smile to its audience's faces.  Unfortunately, Mamoru is reduced to nothing more than Usagi's perfect boyfriend this time around, which is one of the reasons so many fans hate him.  The S season also continues to suffer from rocky-pacing, but it seems to have less filler-in episodes than the previous two seasons.  The ending to this season is also exiciting and will have you coming back for more.  The animation is a little different in its style than the first two seasons, but it's still quite lovely even with all the animation errors, and the music for the S season is excellent, as usual.  Geneon's DVD release of Sailor Moon is also a huge improvement over ADV's.  Fans don't need to worry about any errors with this release.  The video quality on these discs look fantastic.  The audio quality is also quite good, even if it is in monotone.  While the episodes on Geneon's DVDs are actually presented in their proper order (the episode previews appear before the opening credits, for example), Geneon skipped the first two opening credits.  The opening credit animation is  supposed to change three times during the course of this season, and Geneon just skips to the third opening for reasons unknown.  They did include the first two openings as bonus features though, and the next episode previews are still omitted on these DVDs, but those basically only showed clips of next week's episode, so their absence doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the actual show any.

Speaking of extras, while there's nothing particulary outstanding about them, Geneon actually took what little they had and made some fairly nice bonus features out of them.  Basically, all you get on these DVDs are the textless opening/ending credits (with karaoke versions available, too) character profiles, and an art gallery.  This may not be anything too thrilling, but it is nice that they actually took the effort to include them on here.  While the first two seasons of Sailor Moon had sub-only DVD boxset releases, the S DVDs are bilingual, containing both the original Japanese version with English subtitles, and an uncut English dubbed version.  Actually, the uncut dub on these DVDs isn't purely uncut.  What Geneon did was they took all of the visual footage that Cloverway cut out from the edited dub and re-inserted it into the episodes, and recorded any new dialog that was required for the re-inserted scenes, but the rest of the show itself is identical to the edited dub.  So, until Sailor Moon gets a proper uncut dub (which is highly unlikely to ever happen), fans are better off watching the Japanese version, which was thankfully included on the DVDs.  While Geneon's Sailor Moon DVD release may be far from being perfect, they are a huge improvement over the first two seasons' DVD releases, and S is definetly a season Sailor Moon fans shouldn't miss out on.  This is Sailor Moon at its best and is highly recommened to all fans.  Sailor Moon S is rated 13+ for animated violence, strong language, brief nudity, and homosexuality.",1110240000,18,5799,4.784136546184739
863901,4,6304404859,"This to my mind is the best of the 5 seasons of Sailor Moon, so I was eager to get the DVD box set. I'll divide this review into *detailed* info about the characters/story and the translation/packaging.

Characters/Story:
If you've only seen the first two seasons of Sailor Moon, this one may come as a bit of a shock, since it takes quite a different turn in theme, especially in the latter half (in this set, the 2nd half of disc 4, plus discs 5 and 6).

To make an analogy, Sailor Moon S is the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the Sailor Moon series: it comes in the middle of the series, but more than that, it also alters the tone of the series; the other seasons surrounding it are much more light-hearted. S is significantly darker, with more mature themes (the emphasis on world destruction is prominent), and the addition of new characters adds new blood to the series. These new characters and their personalities (to my mind) are more interesting: they have a more serious agenda, more strength and more evolved personalities; this tempers the sometimes-annoying aspects of the younger Usagi and friends (and Chibiusa). The manner in which Uranus, Neptune and Pluto play off of the original Sailor Soldiers helps to add depth to the characters of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Sailor Moon. Each of the original characters gets at least one ""personalized"" episode focusing on their own obstacles, as does Haruka/Uranus (in which Michiru/Neptune plays a big part, as one would expect).

There is still some silly stuff (the Daimons in the early part of the series are all pretty goofy) but as the season progresses the intensity of the enemies and the issues increases.

This particular season is also where the tide turns from being a kid-friendly cartoon into something rather more serious. Again, despite some silly enemies and friendship-oriented storylines, the increased focus on destruction, ""The Silence,"" and a child whose possessed father has twisted her into a force of evil with apocalyptic powers certainly has the potential to freak out a lot of kids. As viewers may or may not be aware, in Japan this wasn't really meant as a kids' show (as is the case with many anime programs), which is why some of the characters/plotlines had to be manipulated to make them fit the audience to which the show was ostensibly marketed when it was aired on U.S. tv (i.e. children). This box set recommends that the show is suitable for ages 13+, which sounds accurate to me based on the content of this season.

Also, less-than-liberal-minded folk might be distraught over the fact that Haruka and Michiru are a lesbian couple. In the dub [more on that in a minute] they are said to be ""cousins,"" though one would have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to buy that story, considering the events of various episodes. In my opinion, their relationship is much deeper, and sweeter, than the oft-cloying one of Usagi and Mamoru. Uranus and Neptune's combined powers also make them a well-matched team during battle sequences, as do their personalities in their everyday surroundings. They also work side by side, unlike Tuxedo Kamen (Mamoru -- whose very name means ""to protect"" or ""guard""), who usually swoops in to save Sailor Moon when something has gotten too hard for her to handle, though he isn't consistently present.

Translation/Packaging:
Like many other viewers, I prefer the subtitled version [this is the case for anything foreign that I watch, really], and once you've seen it in the original format, the dub comes across as pretty dreadful, but in this case part of that is due to the changing of the characters' relationship (Haruka and Michiru) and how some episode plots were tinkered with to accomodate the idea that they are supposed to be ""cousins"" rather than partners. (If you want to see the difference between the real story and how it's been changed in the dubbing process, when you're on the menu page at the beginning of any of the discs, go to the Setup section and choose English language with subtitles On; this way you are watching the dub but with the subtitles from the original Japanese version, so you can follow along and see what was warped during the translation. This is particularly enlightening for the episode ""The Distant Days of Uranus."")

Though I prefer the subtitles, there were a couple of strange discrepancies, such as name spellings, between discs; in one, the name of the first of the Witches 5 is spelled ""Yujiel"" and thereafter it's ""Eugeal."" Not a big deal, but a little editing would have helped continuity.
Also, as others have mentioned, the translation of ""odango atama"" (dumpling head -- a reference to Usagi's hairdo) to ""buns-head"" is just plain wrong. (One line in particular in a subtitled episode comes out really badly with this translation...I'll let you find it.) Even ""meatball-head"" from the dub would be preferable to this.

As to the physical aspects of the box set, the slimline packaging doesn't bother me, though some other people don't seem to care for it. It was easy to get the DVDs out of their plastic holders within the cases (which isn't always true!), and the thick cardboard slipcase seems like it will be durable, which are the most important elements to me.

I do wish that there were some special features with these DVDs! That may be the biggest disappointment.

Overall, this is a great season and a decent set. Enjoy it!",1109721600,30,5412,4.822198275862069

863907,5,6304404859,"Personally, I think Geneon did a better job at these DVDs than ADV. You have so many more options, like textless openings and endings, character information, and DVD credits. Plus scene access. Also, is you're a fan of both versions (dubbed & subbed) you should buy these DVDs. They have the subbed & dubbed versions of the show! And they're much cheaper than ADV and not as big. So, they don't take up as much space. And don't forget.. Sailor Moon S is the most popular versin of the show!!! *ADV did a good job at subbing the first two seasons...but Geneon did a better job.* Did I mention that the color and sounds are much better too?",1096502400,13,638,4.415254237288136

i purchased the thin pack box set to replace my original pioneer release dvds so i'm able to compare the two side by side. if you're looking to save space, this is a good substitute. if you're looking for dvds that look really cool, go with the original releases. although these thin dvds do not have the tacky red ""geneon signature series"" stripe at the top, the backs of all 6 have the same picture and the dvd discs all feature the same image. they do not include chapter inserts in each case and do not have the reversable covers.

as far as the video and audio quality i can't really tell a difference. apparently the entire sailor moon series was recorded in mono because every company who has released the show has done it in mono.",1092614400,31,848,4.360759493670886

They did three things I do not like they have the disks start in english,(the english version is seriously for 4 year olds), Secound they have the third version of the opening run from episode 1 which just spoils all of the improtant events if you know any events that happen from the start, (thought you can see version 1 and version 2 on disks 3 and 4 it is not the same) Lastly they translated Odangwo Amata to mean Bun-Head not Dumpling Head. Thought is was nice that they did not play ADV giving the english names to things like the Moon Princess Halation attack in episode 90 (first one in this series) Worth a buy for anyone even slightly into sailor moon and for first timers this is a very good start though the frist two seasons are also very good.",1090713600,3,857,4.263803680981595

I found Season 3 through a company who sends directly from Malaysia before it was offered on Amazon, and the story line blew me away!  It's a far cry from the Americanized version, definitely not a little kids show.  The revelations throughout this season are astounding.  This season is probably my favorite, along with Season 5, Sailor Stars.  If you want the URL to order Sailor Stars, feel free to email me at kevinpeterstewart@hotmail.com.  In short, Season 3 should NOT be missed and is definitely worth the cash.  Ciao!",1089504000,4,654,4.734513274336283

That, and face a mysterious, powerful new enemy that want to steal people's pure hearts.  And they encounter two new mysterious soldiers, who apparantly don't want to be involved with Sailor Moon.
  I first saw Sailor Moon S when it was aired on Cartoon Network, and I was really suprised with the improvements that they made with the dub.  The original background music was used, and most of the new characters names had been retained.  These were removed when Dic dubbed the first two seasons, but luckily, CWI took over to dub the third and fourth seasons.
  Even though I'm mentioning the dub, I prefer the original  Japanese soundtrack.  And in this boxed set, the sound and video were clear.  Those were the problems that I found most irritating in the previously released ADV boxed sets of the first and second seasons.  My only critisizms on the boxed set itself is that it lacks the reversable covers that were in the original releases, and the cases are thin-packs.  Other than those drawbacks, this is an excellent boxed set to an excellent season of Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon.  And I suggest that if you're a fan of the dub and the original version, you should definetely get this.",1089417600,10,1406,4.685714285714286

Starting with the names: Serena, Lita, Darien, etc.  But more importantly, Haruka and Michiru are Amara and Michelle, COUSINS.  Anyone who knows the real Sailormoon knows that they are a lesbian couple, and that for some reason the American dubbers considered that inappropriate. (Bigots).  Anyway, this season is the best because it has all my favorite Sailor Senshi in it (meaning not the Starlights or Chibi Chibi or the evil ones), and lots of plot twists and an interesting and touching end.

864087,5,6304404859,"probably the best dvd in the sailor moon S series. it comes with 6 episodes and they are episodes:
20) A Time of Shock! True Idenities Revealed to One Another: minako gets her pure heart crystal snatched and the scouts all find out who uranus and neptune are along with them learning the inner scouts identities.
21) Death of Uranus and Neptune!? Talismans Appear: eugeal reveals that uranus/amara/haruka and neptune/michelle/michiru have the pure heart crystals which hold the talismans and they're both taken from them.
22) The Grail's Divine Power! Moon's Double Transformation: setsuna meiou reveals herself as sailor pluto and the holder of the last talisman. sailor moon and eugeal fight for the grail that appears and moon gets it and changes into super sailor moon.
24) Who is the True Messiah? Chaos of Light and Darkness: the mad scientist in the lab creates a new type of daimohn of mimet, eugeal was killed, and sends it after a movie star. chibiusa meets hotaru for the first time.
25) A House Full of Evil Presence! The Secret of the Beautiful Girl, Hotaru: rini/chibiusa goes to hotaru tomoe's house with usagi/serena and they leave for a book signing but sailor moon ends up saving the book signer.
26) Crazy for Celebrities! Mimet, In Doubt: mimet and minako sign up for a contest to see who will be in a movie with a handsome actor, but things go foul when mimet doesn't win and she sicks her daimohn after the actor.
these 6 episodes come in the original japanese version and the dvd has them dubbed in english. although the subbed version is way better, it is good to hear the english voice actors. it also comes with a special reversible cover of sailor pluto holding a white, shining pure heart crystal in one hand and her garnet rod in the other. the dvd has specials like you get to see the original opening for the S(uper) series and it has a gallery on sailor mercury/ami mizuno/amy anderson and it has info on her. all in all an excellent dvd.",1088035200,3,1970,4.64756446991404

I fell in love with this series for its good dramatic action, with some comedy thrown in to make it a bit more appealing.

Sailor Moon S has a reputation for being the best of the Sailor Moon seasons. This DVD will not let you down.
""A Time of Shock! True Identies Revealed to One Another""
-This episode gets the action rolling. Uranus and Neptune reveal their identies to the Sailor senshi at last.
""Death of Uranus and Neptune!? Talismans Appear... This is, without a doubt, my favorite episode of all time. Haruka and Michiru fans rejoice as Haruka and Michiru finally reveal- or at the least strongly suggest- their romantic feelings to each other, only to have to pay the ultimate price later in the episode. The japanese voice actors did an amazing job, and really poured emotion in the voices. I could keep praising, but time to move on. :)
""The Grail's Divine Power! Moon's Double Transformation""
-Well, the title gives away most of the episode: Sailor Moon finally gets ahold of the grail and transforms into Super Sailor Moon- but whether she's the Messiah remains to be seen. A must see!
""Who is the True Messiah? Chaos of Light and Darkness"" and ""A House Full of Evil Presence! The Secret of the Beautiful Girl, Hotaru""
-These two episodes focus on Professor Tomoe's switch to the bubbly celebrity-crazy Mimet as his assisant, and the introduction of Chibi Usa's mysterious new friend Hotaru- who happens to be Proffesor Tomoe's daughter. Defiantly worth watching!
""Crazy for Celebrities! Mimet, in Doubt""
-This is a light-hearted episode, a perfect end note after all the drama. The Death Busters are still out in search of pure heart crystals- however this time, they're just mass-collecting them for the awakening of their evil Messiah of Silence...

864417,5,6304404859,"The second DVD in the Pegasus Collection has it all--funny episodes, serious episodes, and touching episodes.  We all look to the episode, Protect Mamoru! Jealousy of Usagi the Ninja.  Without a doubt this is the best, or at least the funniest episode on the DVD.  It starts out with hilarity when Diana mistakes some smoke for a fire and Rei, getting the fire extinguisher, trips and sprays it everywhere.  Then Mamoru ends up staying at Rei's place, much to Usagi's discontent.  This episode is just one hilarious thing after another as Rei accidentally sees Mamoru in the bath, Grandpa Hino tries to teach Yuuichiro to get girls, and, the highlight of the episode in my opinion, Usagi dresses in a ninja costume and stalks Rei throughout Mamoru's stay there.  Diana's innocence is cute too.  The other episode I'm going to feature in this review is Try for the Best of Japan! The Worries of a Beautiful Girl Swordsman.  Little Miharu, seemingly misunderstood by her mother, stays with the Tsukinos for awhile.  She is trying to be the best swordsman in Japan, but her mother battles her and acts cruel to her.  Usagi and Chibiusa are furious and confront her, only to be told to leave her alone and to go away.  Miharu is fooled by Tigerseye and after she is found not to be hiding Pegasus in her dream, helps defeat the Lemre.  She learns a lesson and her mother turns out to be justified after all.  A sweet episode.  Also don't miss Fisheye's first episode, Makoto's friend Tomoko, Ami helping to fix a car (?), and Chibiusa nearly being revealed as having Pegasus in her dream.",1042761600,6,1584,4.671480144404332

Her mother is very strict, but she's that way because she loves Miharu. This episode is very touching, and the whole Super S season is soooo cute! Sometimes the senshi do faces that look soooo cute!

864422,1,6304404859,"I am die-hard fan of the original Sailor Moon and the Manga, but the English version, just sucks. Here is the
 list of complaints......
1. The voices. THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS, THEY HAVE THE VOICES OF TWENTY AND THRITY YEAR OLD WOMEN. Plus the nature of the voices dosen't suit the characters at all. Usagi(serena) sounds like thiry year old woman. Ami (Amy) also sounds like a thirty year old woman. Rei (raye) sounds like she has a permanat frog in her throught. Makoto (lita) sounds like she has a congested nose. Minkako (mina) sounds like another thirty year old women. Luna sounds like a freaking old english granny *shoot me* Also Marmoru or Endyimions (darien or prince darien's) voice sounds like a ten-year-old when he is supposed to be a collage student.
2. Sever and usless editing. Every episode has so many pointless edits it is not even funny. Ever heard of putting for ages so-and so-. The scene where Prince Endyimion is stabbed is taked out. Also the last English episode was originally one episode in Japan. They said that the senshi(scouts) were taken to the Negaverse, but the die. And this makes it seem like they are going on a vacation. The original entrence and exit songs are replaced with the English stuff which is awfull. Kunzite's (malachite's) death was...., there is no word to as how stupid it was
3. Music. This DVD has absolutely no qualiy in music, what-so-ever. The theme songs is just a bung of little girls singing 'she is the one named sailor moon' over and over and over and over again; it drives me crazy. They sing the same song the the entrence and exit songs, which drives me nutts too.
4. Unlike original this version is just plain boring after a while. In the original this is non-stop action, yet here it is lets-take-our-time.
Actually I could go on for hours with how much is wrong with this DVD. I am a die-hard anime fan, and with dubbing in English this seris was dubbed very poorly. There could of been a lot more effort into making it have much better quality. Don't waist your hard earned money on this peice of junk.",1039996800,,2097,4.562334217506631
864423,5,6304404859,"As much as I love the original Japanese edition. I first fell in love with Sailor Moon on TV, with the very edited dub edition. So there's a place in my heart for these DVD's. ADV is doing an amazing job with them, rock bottom prices, 6 episodes per disc, and two DVD's at a time. Unlike Pioneer's 1 disc every 2-4 months. I highly recommend this disc, as it contains some of the best episodes of the entire season.",1037836800,8,415,4.2
864424,5,6304404859,"I don't like Chibi-usa. She takes over this season like a pink cancer
That said, Sailor Moon SuperS is good despite the focus on Chibi-usa. The episodes in this first disc of the season are naturally about Sailor Moon's powerup for the season, but that's expected. There are a bunch of humorous moments (SuperS is much more focused on humor than the last three seasons were) including the use (in Japanese) of the phrase ""That's a ridiculous banana!"" (I'm not kidding about that, either. It's really there.) The only episode that stands out is the last one, where Diana appears. I won't say too much so as not to spoil it, but it's really funny.
One note. In the dub, Fish Eye is a woman, while in the Japanese version, he was a man. The change doesn't annoy me too much (I don't like Fish Eye too much, man or woman), but the wierd thing is that his Japanese voice sounds female too.
This season is heavy on Chibi-usa, but there's enough action and comedy to interest any fan of Sailor Moon, even if you don't like the little pink Sailor Senshi.",1035417600,4,1046,4.453125
864524,5,6304404859,"This is volume 4 of 6
This DVD is pretty good. some of the best episodes in the season, action-wise, are on this volume. One of the best episodes on the disc is the first one, about Minako's quest to be recognized as having a pure heart. Then there are the two episodes involving the Talismans. The relationship between Uranus and Neptune is shown with a wierd sort of handplay in the second ep on the disc. (In the Japanese version, the two are lovers) This explains Uranus' eagerness to remove her own pure heart after Neptune is killed. These two episodes are very powerful, especially in the subtitled version. The last three episodes feature Mimet, who possibly has the most annoying Japanese voice I've ever heard! It's during these episodes that Hotaru is introduced, and she'll dominate the series for a few episodes a little later.

One feature I especially liked was the ability to switch between English and Japanese languages at anytime without a pause in the show. The only thing I saw that could have been done better were the subtitles. I have downloaded versions of this show online with much better subtitling. More thought could have been put into that.

Although some things are repetitve, SS has very interesting concepts and well-thought out characters.
I like SS because I think Rini is a good character and essential to the show. After having the other seasons based on the other characters, SS is a refreshing new outlook from a different perspective.
This DVD is a good buy if you're a Sailor Moon collector, even if you don't prefer the season. This is a must-have, must-get Sailor Moon DVD. This is why I reccomend this DVD I suggest you get it before it's not available anymore.",1017705600,,782,4.5928571428571425

This is the first DVD of the newly released Pegasus Collection Series. It has 6 episodes.
Reeny starts off the series with a mysterious dream.  A Pegasus enters, and asks to keep their meeting a secret.  Was it real?
The world has been saved, and Sailor Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto are gone. Believe it or not, yet another threat approaches--The invation of the Dead Moon Circus!  Employed by their leader, the Amazon Trio (Fish eye, Hawks eye, and Tigers eye) emerges to capture The One (Pegasus).  Pegasus is hiding out in a beautiful dream, the only medium through which Pegasus is able to exist.
The Amazon Trio hunt down the holders of beautiful dreams in order to seek out The One, but Pegasus powers up Sailor Moon and Mini Moon (to reveal a dual transformation by them both) to help them instead. Sailor Moon of course also uses her rather impressive, powerful new attack. So their plans get foiled episode after episode, packing hefty action.
This DVD gets 4 stars:  It is a great start of a new adventure that seems better than ever.  But the 4 Sailor Scouts still seem to lack behind, even after Reeni. (Considering after all the power-ups that Sailor Moon made, their powers seem helpless; they can only watch and support Sailor Moon as much as they can).",1017446400,,1332,4.924107142857143

864715,3,6304404859,"This DVD begins the 4th season of Sailor Moon, which is generally considered to be the weakest of the five seasons (except perhaps for the ""Doom Tree"" episodes at the beginning of season 2). The storyline in this series focuses more on Chibiusa (A.K.A ""Rini"" in the dubbed version), and shows an obvious attempt to steer SM toward a younger audience as ratings dropped.  Also, Haruka (Amara), Michiru (Michelle), Setsuna (Trista), and Hotaru are completely missing from the entire SuperS season.
This DVD contains the first six episodes of the dubbed (English) versions that aired on Cartoon Network in the US, as well as their ""uncut"" original (Japanese) counterparts.
However, I have to use the term ""uncut"" loosely. One of the first things I noticed was that in the English subtitles for the ""uncut"" Japanese version, Fish Eye was referred to as ""she,"" although in the original Fish Eye, like the other two members of the Amazon Trio, is a man (albeit an effeminate one).  I wonder how the episode where Fish Eye poses as a female model (including the scene where HE throws HIS shirt off and startles those around him) will be handled. But I digress.
Extras were a bit lacking on this disc, which is the other reason I give it only 3 stars.  The only extra is version 1 of the original opening.  The menu design changed from the last set of discs, and it was kind of cute. And as usual, the menus are well designed.
In short, SM fans should go ahead and get this disc, because the weakest season of SM is still fun to watch. For newcomers to SM I would recommend you look at the Sailor Moon S season first.",1015718400,5,1609,4.557093425605537

The package design is completely outstanding!  It has a reversible cover of Sailor Chibi Moon.
The interactive menus are really neat.  The main menu has the picture of Super Sailor Moon that is on the cover, except that she actually blinks and her hair moves with the wind, plus there is some little scenes from the show in the background.

The 1st season is a must see and once you se the first,you'll have to see the 2nd.......3rd.....4th.....5th(if it would ever come to the US).Do you catch my drift????",1009670400,3,412,4.506666666666667
864720,5,6304404859,"It's so easy to kick the SuperS season around. For starters, it centers around Chibiusa, Usagi's future daughter, better known to those who hate her as ""the Pink Spore."" It also stars a winged unicorn named Pegasus (how he transformed from his original Greek version into an alicorn is beyond me) who spends most of the series popping up in Chibiusa's room after dark. Furthermore, the first set of villains, known as the Amazon Trio, use what is arguably the lamest method of ""sneaking up"" on their victims that you'll ever see. Finally, it's missing the Outer Senshi, which is blasphemy for the fans of the Haruka/Michiru (a.k.a. Uranus/Neptune) couple.
However, somewhere beneath that oh-so-sugary crust is a very good series which manages to be very entertaining in spite of itself. SuperS features some hilarious Usagi/Mamoru/Chibiusa interaction, taking the future King, Queen, and Princess into situations which make you wonder if they're going to be able to keep from killing each other before they even get started as a family. Also, as lame as their attacks may be, the Amazon Trio is a lot of fun to watch, especially when they're lounging around before picking their weekly victim. The ""monster of the week"" and ""evil organization"" concepts that run through the entire Sailor Moon series get new twists this time around, making for some very interesting mischief. The evil organization in the SuperS season is called the Dead Moon Circus, and as a result both the major villains and weekly monsters are based on twisted versions of bizarre circus characters. If you've always thought of clowns as being evil, just wait until you meet Mr. Magic Pierrot.
SuperS also features some of the best background music of the series, with the Dead Moon Circus themes being the highlight. If memory serves, Naoko Takeuchi (the author of the original manga) once said that the end credits theme used in the later episodes was her favorite music to date when the series aired. Your mileage may vary, but even if you don't like it, there are more than enough good musical moments elsewhere in the series to make up for it.
An important note: one member of the Amazon Trio (Fish Eye) was a big problem for the folks who dubbed this series into English. They didn't dare try to present a gay transvestite character to the afternoon Cartoon Network kiddie crowd, so they wound up making some serious changes to the script as a result. If you are the least bit homophobic, you won't like the first half of this series at all if you watch the original Japanese version. Still, if you're offended to this degree, the Haruka/Michiru lesbian pair from the S season probably chased you off before you even got this far. Haruka and Michiru are missing from SuperS, but the gender twists are back with a vengance. You can avoid dealing with this altogether by watching only the English dub, but the Japanese version is so superior in both acting and storyline that it merits watching even if you're not 100% comfortable with the ideas that it presents.
All in all, the SuperS series is classic Sailor Moon, even if it does spend too much time on the Pink Spore. It's still a major part of one of the best anime series ever created, and a must for anyone who wants to really experience the full scope of Japanese animation.",1008288000,6,3308,4.774869109947644

864812,5,6304404859,"Hi everyone. I would just like to take a minute and write a little about the Sailor Moon series which always seems to get dumped on by everyone. Sailor Moon SuperS begins right where the action of Sailor Moon S (which I also recommend you buy) leaves off.
  Chibi-usa is sleeping before she is going to go to see the eclipse with her friends. It is in this dream that the mysterious horse Pegasus emerges and asks her to tell noone of their encounter. When she awakens... she is obviously questioning whether or not the dream was real. She goes to the park to meet her friends (the Sailor Senshi of course) and it is also at this time that the Dead Moon Circus arrives. Leaving everyone questioning who it could be.
  While I will agree that SuperS doesn't have as much action as it's 3 predecesors. SuperS has some of the best voice acting, and a wonderful action which progresses through the episodes ( probably v. 1 DVD, and v. 5+6 will be mot evident.)

864817,5,6304404859,"Yes, as stupid as this may sound, my favourite part of the whole DVD was seeing Super Sailor Moon's new Rainbow Moon Heart Ache attack in the series itself for the first time. It has really funky music that they didn't use in the S movie (the only time I'd seen this attack until now), and I kept playing it over and over again (and I'm sure all the people who hate Sailor Moon for its constant use of stock footage are going, ""Huh!?"") Anyway, onto the review itself ^_- Suffice it to say, the video and audio quality are about the same as before. However, from this disc onwards (I'm not sure what episode exactly), the problem with the episodes having the wrong opening credits is fixed! It's not because Pioneer fixed it though, it's just because now that Sailor Pluto and Hotaru have arrived, the animation they've been using all along is the correct one for the episodes ^^; The menus feature Sailor Mercury, and are one of the many reasons for this disc being my favourite out of the four released. Containing another 6 episodes in uncut subtitled and uncut dubbed format, this is the best disc so far in terms of content. There's one filler episode on this disc, and another three that seem like any other filler episode but do advance the storyline (and of course the fourth episode has Rainbow Moon Heart Ache ^^). However, the remaining two episodes are the best so far in the series, with the Talismans and Holy Grail that Uranus and Neptune have been searching for finally appearing (along with Sailor Pluto), Sailor Moon gaining a new power, and Eugeal getting killed (technically a spoiler, but was there are single person here who didn't think she'd get killed eventually? No? Good.) Eugeal's successor as Professor Tomoe's main henchman (henchwoman?) is the celebrity-obsessed Mimet, who's very... celebrity-obsessed ^^; Towards the end of this disc we also get introduced to Hotaru, a frail girl with an imporant secret who Chibi-Usa becomes friends with... The outside cover shows Super Sailor Moon, and is the best one so far - yes, even better than the Mars/Venus picture. It's a shame Amazon don't have a picture of it, but if you search online I'm sure you can find one somewhere else. The inside cover shows Sailor Pluto and is kind of boring in my opinion, but at least the choice is there. Time to sum up. If you've bought the first three already you must like the series at least a little bit, and this is the best one so far, so get this. Although I think most people buy one disc at a time, so if you've bought the first three you're probably somewhere between liking the series and being scarily obsessed with it (I won't comment on where I go on the scale ;), so it's pretty much a given that you'll want to buy this. ^^",998870400,11,2750,4.557575757575758

Many of these episodes are very touching, but only in their original Japanese with English subtitles.  When it was dubbed, it lost a great deal of its seriousness, as if America is afraid that an animated tv show should have any sort of value or that it should in any way relate to real feelings.

I really  wish someone would look to the quality of the show which they are  translating instead of looking for maximum profit.",961804800,4,932,4.628048780487805

But, I throughly enjoyed the Doom Tree Series.. ESPECIALLY the last two episodes  of it.  They're superb.  Being a fan of Serena's (Sailormoon's) and  Darian's (Tuxedo Mask's) relationship, I thought this series was a turning  point for their relationship.  I especially found it incredibally sad when  Darian broke up with Serena for her own good.  I haven't purchased the  boxed set of the Doom Tree Series, but I did tape all of the episodes when  they aired on Cartoon Network.  If you are a Sailormoon fan, or would like  to become one, I HIGHLY reccomend this set.  It's also good for a  collectible.  I hope this review helps you in your decision.

Venus shows up at just the right time but Darien feel that  the scouts hate him when they said that they didn't need his help anyway.  All in all, I think that this movie is worth getting. It is good and I  think that you will like it. It is a good movie for all ages.

The only noticable errors in DiC's Doon Tree  series is the slight continuity gaps between ""The Return of Sailor  Moon"" and ""So You Want to be in Pictures."" This set is  pretty much the best dubbed tapes you can buy. The Buena-Vista released  tapes of first season episodes feature a lot more censoring and editing,  especially the ""Good Queen, Bad Queen"" video. As an alternative  to the ""Doom Tree"" series, the Sailor Moon R movie dub  ""Promise of the Rose"" is also a pretty-good dub.

  The Doom  Tree Series is something you have to watch. It shows that after Darien was  revived from the Imperium Crystal, a part of him has escaped. That part was  when he was Tuxedo Mask, and that part turned into Moonlight Knight. It's  pretty annoying when Serena tries very hard to give Darien his memories  back. She goes past stupid to revive his love for her. Anyways, I do not  want to say everything about it. The last thing I watched was about the 4  sisters which I can see is not out dubbed.

I bought the Doom Tree series just before I had my wisdom teeth out, figuring it would make for good entertainment while I was recovering.  I was  perfectly coherant after having my teeth out, which was unlucky for me, and  was in a great deal of pain that codine could not fix.  However, the Doom  Tree series took my mind off the pain.  I was so upset when I thought  Sailor Moon ended with the destruction of Queen Beryl.  Luckily it  continued on with the Doom Tree Series.
This series is where Sailor Moon  and all the other Sailor Scouts regain their memories about being Sailor  Scouts and being from the Moon Kingdom.  They are now faced up against  Allen and Ann who are aliens from the Negaverse who must drain human's of  their life energy to live.
Sailor Moon gains a new transformation and a  new weapon to destroy evil and the other Sailor Scouts gain impressive and  powerful new attacks.  The animation is wonderful and I promise you that if  you love Sailor Moon you will not be disapointed.  So if you are getting  your wisdom teeth out, buy this set in advance.  If you just love Sailor  Moon, I would also recomend that you buy this.

The adventures of such charming wide-eyed doll-like creatures in those adorable sailor-style costumes all  take place in a clean, safe utopian society parallel to the real-life Japan  where the wildest fantasies actually happen. I simply just relish in those  streaking stars, bouncing bubbles, and sparkling glitter that surround  those magical schoolgirls as they coyly ward off the weirdest monsters so  gleefully created by the spoiled sons of the villainous family from outer  space. However, despite the very fact Sailor Moon could work some real  sorcery, it seems to me that she doesn't know how to fight at all. Instead,  she would take one look, scream loudly, and scurry right off with her tiny  skirt flying about her well-developed thighs. And it's up to the Prince  Charming in a top hat, a white mask, and a flowing cape to save the poor  girl in the nick of the time with a single rose thrown just like a dagger.

865905,1,6304404859,"DiC's pathetic attempt at dubbing Bishoujo Senshi Sera Muun has slaughtered our dear Sailor Senshi.  I only gave them one star because they used the original animation.  And who said this was an attempt at the power  rangers (Dentai Senchi(?) Mega Ranger for those in the know)?  This is  nothing like them.  Besides if you watched the original version of DSMR  you'd find it a whole lot better in Japanese.  Who knows- they might  actually have a PERMANENT cast!  Back to BSSM...  the dub voices and  storylines just don't do justice to the efforts of the original seiyuu!  And since when is Zoisite(sp?) a woman!!  He's a man, get over it!!  DiC  made him a woman!  That's the ultimate insult!  They cut out half of the  last episode of Sailor Moon Classic (First Season).  They've cut out a  multitude of episodes from the first season and cut parts of attacks and  transformations!  They're just bodylines, don't have a cow DiC!  I don't  even want to think about what they'd do to Haruka and Michiru if they ever  dub S!  Hopefully we'll be really lucky and Pioneer Entertainment will  subtitle the rest!

Sailor  Venus seams a little full of herself. But I love all of the scouts and the  show. If your are looking for a good video this is it but also look at  Secert Identies!

It's nice that the first 13 episodes of Sailor Moon R got a slightly better treatment (at least they no longer reversed the screen to pretend people drive on the right side of the road in Tokyo like in the first season), but rest assured the episodes are heavily censored along with the added corny Sailor Moon says rants at the end of each episode.

I would have been kinder reviewing if I had grown up with the hacked english dub but unfortunately I grew up with the mostly uncensored mexican spanish dub. The US voices make me cringe (especially Luna) and Rei Hino's sugary cute voice seem so out of character especially when he acts brash.

The alien siblings are okay in the dub but I will prefer the mexican dub anyday. I will probably consider selling the boxset to any collectors, I only watched them once and have kept them stored in a shelf.",1482019200,,1033,4.403141361256544
