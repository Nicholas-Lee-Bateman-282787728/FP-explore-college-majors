The Amityville Horror and The Legend Of Hell House are both scary and worth the price of admission alone.

Poltergeist II, had potential to match the quality of the first movie, yet falls short due to apparent editing issues. The story is quite good. Though, the ending is slightly disappointing. Poltergeist III, is creepy and campy at the same time and is the weakest release in the Poltergeist trilogy.",1288569600,10,614,4.783018867924528

8281118,3,B001B1872U,"You get 4 movies on DVD in this 3-disc set: Amityville Horror (2005 Remake), Legend of Hell House, Poltergeist II and Poltergeist III. All are worth watching. No extras are included in this set (it is bare-bones). However, 2 of these films don't have a Blu-Ray anyway so you aren't missing any new content anyway (previous releases were also devoid of bonus material). You are getting your money's worth in this value pack if you want more than one film even though it has no extras. My personal favorites are Poltergeist II and III. Both were under-appreciated classic horror films with Heather O'Rourke.

Poltergeist II features the same cast as the original with a couple of new characters: the unforgettable Rev. Henry Kane and Will Sampson as Taylor. Both died shortly after filming. We were terrified during Poltergeist II at the release but that film doesn't hold up well now. It does have some excellent acting and creepy moments. Fans may hate me but Part 2 was horrifying at the time but seems to drag now. Poltergeist III doesn't get much respect but it is an entertaining movie with Heather O'Rourke returning with ""the guy from Alien and the chick from Robocop"". Tom Skerritt and Nancy Allen both seem to be alive and well. We aren't joking about the Poltergeist Curse. Poltergeist III is lightly regarded but is actually quite good. It has two returning cast members playing ""Carol-Anne"" and ""Tangina"". Though Kip Wentz, Richard Fire and Heather O'Rourke never worked again (Wentz and Fire were hilarious together in their scenes) I prefer Part 3 to Part 2. The third film uses mirrors, smoke and ice fairly well for its era. I admit there are some annoying and illogical scenes with coffee cups, dumb teenagers and pool parties. The acting and audio seem off but the movie was filmed that way. It's enjoyable enough and much better than many other second sequels in horror by a long-shot. The advantage to Poltergeist is its tight canon (only three films) so if you like one then you can appreciate them all. If any horror franchise deserved a box set with extended scenes, director's cut and a full behind the scenes 4-hour documentary then it is this one. Neither sequel can compare to the original. Perhaps we will get a Poltergeist Deluxe Box Set one day but it seems very unlikely with the incredibly true and incredibly bizarre story about the Poltergeist Curse. Part 1 & 2 (but not 3) do have Blu-ray releases.

The new remake of The Amityville Horror (2005) is a classic ""family trapped in a haunted house"" film that is very enjoyable. Your first watch of the original or remake holds all the power. I won't confirm its authenticity since a lengthy book and film canon already do that. The original Amityville has aged and isn't perfect in itself so Ryan Reynolds delivers a fresh performance that looks good next to James Brolin. The Legend of Hell House features the film adaptation of Richard Matheson's haunted house best-selling book. It has somewhat dated but has it charms.

If this collection got a Blu-Ray release with extras I would probably rate it 4 stars. It works as a value pack. Good classic intro films for a horror freak.",1377216000,2,3162,4.766423357664234
