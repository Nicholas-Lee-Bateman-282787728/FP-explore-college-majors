6612643,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"Star Trek's ""green girl"" was Susan Oliver, among the busiest television actresses of the 1950s-80s. She also was one of the most talented, which is to say that for range, power, and subtlety, she had virtually no competition during those many years. As George Pappy's very pleasing documentary reminds us, when casting directors of major TV shows wanted a nonpareil ""special guest star,"" they called Susan Oliver.

Blessed with sharp intelligence and a stunning, feline beauty, Oliver had learned her craft on the stage, catching studio attention as the star of her first movie, a 1957 indie ""B"" called Green Eyed Blonde. But Susan bucked the system by abandoning a coveted, non-exclusive movie contract with Warner Bros. Although she co-starred in more than a dozen feature films after that (notably BUtterfield 8), she never regained her big-screen footing, and became respected primarily for her small-screen work. Susan enjoyed particular artistic success during the first half of the 1960s, with very strong guest appearances on Route 66, The Fugitive, The Defenders, and other top-flight adult dramas.

In lieu of a voice-over narrator, the documentary makes fine use of talking-head interviews with co-workers, family, and friends, to trace the ups and downs of Susan's life and career. The reminiscences of friends Biff Manard and Ron Wright-Scherr are particularly moving.

 Long after she established herself as an actress, Susan grew interested in directing, and although she earned her DGA card and helmed two TV episodes (M*A*S*H and Trapper John, M.D.), she was unable to establish herself behind the camera.

She found true freedom in the skies, as a skilled and tenacious pilot, breaking records, winning competitions, and undertaking a daring trans-Atlantic flight in 1967. (This feat, and much more, is recounted in Susan's gripping 1983 book, Odyssey.) She later earned her Lear jet rating--on Bill Lear's personal jet.

Susan Oliver died in 1990, just 58 years old. Whether or not you're familiar with her body of work, you'll be intrigued by her story and moved by the documentary's final moments, which are beautiful and, frankly, shattering.",1415664000,10,2164,5.294460641399417
6612644,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"""The Green Girl"" is an excellent documentary about Susan Oliver, who was given the title moniker due to her role on the pilot of ""Star Trek"". However, she was a very busy and in-demand actress all throughout the late 50s, 60's and into the 70's.  Often times, the pioneers of the TV/Film industry are neglected or forgotten because they never became that ""famous"". However, director George Pappy makes sure that Oliver will be remembered through the numerous interviews with colleagues and friends, the TV and film clips that shows her talent and range, and most of all, her off the screen accomplishments including her aviation records and her work as one of the first female TV directors.  For fans not just of Susan Oliver, but for fans of nostalgic TV, The Green Girl is a very entertaining and informative film that sheds a light on a discarded woman who was much more than the sum of her (brief) parts.",1412553600,8,908,4.70440251572327
6612645,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"- A true revelation in celebrity documentaries, told with love, respect, earnestness and compassion. The amazing part is that this film could be as emotionally compelling as it is, given that the subject - actress Susan Oliver - was so hard to pin down as an individual. Part mystery, part enigma, and gifted beyond compare, her legacy is thoughtfully preserved in The Green Girl. You don't have to be a fan of Susan to enjoy this film. You don't even have to know who she was. You'll be drawn in, and find yourself wanting to discover her works. Great job by the director and editor. An obvious labor of love for all involved, meticulously researched and presented.",1412208000,18,666,4.700854700854701
6612646,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"This is a feature-length documentary about actress Susan Oliver. The title comes from a rather famous - I daresay ""Iconic"" - role of hers from the first Star Trek pilot made in 1963. She played ""Veena,"" who turned into the Green Orion Slave girl, and fodder for so many fanboys' fantasies.

However, Susan Oliver was much more than one role in a sci-fi TV show. If you watched episodic television in the fifties, sixties, seventies and even the eighties, you will have seen her, as she guest-starred in literally hundreds of shows, from Wagon Train to Route 66 to The Twilight Zone to Peyton Place.  And she was such a good actress, she would appear in multiple roles on any one show; for instance, she appeared four times on Wagon Train, each a different role.

She was also an aviatrix, what they used to call a female pilot. She piloted her own twin-engine plane solo across the Atlantic. She came in first in the Powder Puff Derby, a race featuring only female pilots. In Hollywood she was in the first wave of women directors, sponsored by the AFI. Yet even after directing an episode of M.A.S.H. and Trapper John, she wasn't able to break that glass ceiling to get more directing jobs.

The documentary is a fascinating account of a beautiful woman who could act and was smart, who had many other skills, but who couldn't break down societal barriers to achieve her goals.",1412208000,12,1378,4.635245901639344
6612647,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"I only knew her as Vina from the first Star Trek pilot (which was history-worthy in and of itself), but it turns out she was remarkable in so many other ways, including BEING a pilot.  Worth watching!",1482883200,,200,4.405405405405405

6612650,3,B00N6ZVQ18,"A good documentary with the most clips of Susan Oliver's career that will ever be assembled. As such it is also a valuable overview of the early days of television. However, several problems come up that call into question the resources and abilities of the filmmakers.

The chief one is a lack of interviews or reflections from significant television and film industry peers. Ms. Oliver worked with scores of top-level actors, many of whom are still with us, yet none deigned to be in this documentary, despite almost certainly being asked. Especially curious is the absence of Jerry Lewis, with whom she made several movies and was clearly a friend who offered to pay her hospital bills at the end.

We are left with heavy screen time given to lesser-known performers, some of whom didn't even know she was a pilot, undermining their own credentials as intimates. The one notable exception was David Hedison, although even he is hardly a household name. The film also heavily relies on lesser-known Hollywood writers, production people, and friends, many of whom are posed with their books (and sometimes artwork), offering plenty of praise but little real insight into Ms. Oliver's life and work.

While famous people don't necessarily a good documentary make, their complete absence from this film undermines both the claims of Susan Oliver's importance to the industry and the professional credentials of the filmmakers...to say nothing of seriously hurting the film's chances of garnering mainstream interest.

The documentary also makes no attempt to put any of Ms. Oliver's work or life into perspective, by use of a narrator or any analytical framework. The film is an endless series of TV and movie clips and talking head testimonials...there is no over-arching voice to bring it all together and offer up any kind of summation on who Susan Oliver was and why she might be important and worth remembering.

Details about her personal life, especially her puzzling romantic liaisons and the obviously complicated relationship with her famous astrologer mother, are given a quick once-over. We are only given hints as to whom she may have had relationships with, and while privacy is always sacrosanct, a documentary that doesn't at least attempt to delineate the home life of its subject becomes more a curriculum vitae than a true story of a person.

One can't help but feel the filmmakers kept things light in an effort to do honor to Ms. Oliver. That they did, but the documentary finally leaves one with the same feeling one has about Susan Oliver's career: it was oddly incomplete, and less than it should have been.",1473379200,,2630,5.006864988558353
6612651,4,B00N6ZVQ18,Interesting insight to a very under rated actress that never got her due.,1472860800,,73,4.6923076923076925
6612652,2,B00N6ZVQ18,"WOW! I really wanted to learn about Susan Oliver, the person, gaining some insight into her personality.
She had a unique childhood and parents, and her career and life choices interested me.

This is a dip in the shallow end, maybe up to your ankles, with hardly any depth.

There were many people interviewed for this ""documentary"", but if anyone had any insight into Susan,
it did not came through.

Any intimate truth escaped this film.

And how was Susan with intimacy?  She appeared in public with many men but the film only briefly mentions that she told an escort she hated posing for the press.

This film hardly offers a glimpse.

Because of remarkably poor editing, Susan's true nature flickers for a moment, but there is hardly any picture here.

The first five minutes is men recounting how they had ""a crush"" on Susan's On-Screen Persona. Vacuous!

This sums up the premise of the film....""Susan Oliver was good looking"".

The film then launches into a dizzying series of four to eight second clips.
First, clips of Susan's screen appearances, one after the other after other,
rifling by with no purpose to any story.

We get it! She landed many different parts, one after the other.
Any particular reason why?
Oh yeah!  Because she was pretty.

Then come the interviews, one five second clip after the other rifling by as if there is some point to these interviews.
The work is edited like every interview was cut into five second clips and the scraps were thrown in the air as confetti. picked up and pasted together.

Disjointed, difficult to follow any stream of thought.
Like watching A Godfrey Reggio masterpiece, without any mastery.
Maybe if Coppola underwrote this, we would get to the bottom of Ms. Oliver.

If a film is meant to guide you through an experience, this is freeway traffic whizzing by in the dark.
Who was that? What are they saying?  Why?

Oh yeah? Because she is pretty. That is why I am watching this?

As far as actually knowing anything about Susan, this film is almost an empty exercise in film making.
You can't understand a person by watching one clip after another of their acting, just like you can't understand a woman by peering in her window.
Definitely a film by men, for men.

Why two stars instead of one....well, she was pretty.

But maybe that is the true message of Susan's life,
nothing more to herself and others than a pretty face.",1471737600,3,2391,4.6746411483253585

6612654,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"No need to rehash what others have written about the enigmatic, impossibly beautiful and gifted Susan Oliver.  One of the huge values I saw in this documentary was the people who were interviewed and talked about her.  Like David Hedison from Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, or Roy Thinnes from The Invaders, and much more.  The interviewees were amazing: people I hadn't seen for years.",1467331200,,388,4.7611940298507465
6612655,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"As a lover of classic TV and film, the name Susan Oliver has been familiar to me for quite some time. I knew the standard biographical information about her, but not much else. Recently, I caught her wonderful guest appearance on ""Father Knows Best"" and, through a quick Google search, became aware of this film (I actually recall hearing about it just before it came out, but it had slipped my consciousness). To say this film is fantastic is an understatement. The filmmaker was able to include interviews with so many friends, family, and coworkers who knew her in different ways throughout her life. The people who knew Susan speak of her with such love and passion. So many of the basic things I already knew about Susan were given the details that really complete her story, as well as learning so many new things. As the blanks were filled in on her life behind the screen, I felt, by the end of the film, that I, too, had lost a friend. The last minute left me in complete and utter tears. Absolutely wonderful!!! Highly recommended!!!",1464825600,4,1043,4.612903225806452

I remember watching TV back when I was young in the 70's and always wondering who this beauty was, I had such a huge crush and she was so prolific.  Now 52 I am now rediscovering Susan all over again. The bravery she possessed being only the 4th woman ever to fly solo across the Atlantic took nerves of steel and courage beyond belief. So talented!!  I wish she was still alive so I could tell her, but she's looking down and knows. A great role model to all!! Susan set her mark and stuck to it!

Susan Oliver was beautiful, ambitious and multi-talented. Yet, she had to do things her way, which didn't go over too well with the studios and others.

I wish there could have been more interviews with her. I can't believe that she didn't appear on most of the talk shows of the day. Perhaps the producers of this documentary couldn't locate the videos or they were unavailable.

Still, it is a haunting story of a woman who most only remember as the mesmerizing Green Orion Slave girl.",1434067200,2,724,4.388059701492537
6612672,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"Susan Oliver was an excellent and versatile actress, and probably a better human.  The DVD documentary was well done, and the interviews and movie snips told a story that needed to be told.  I'm a guy, but I like to see strong women strive and succeed where others may fail.  I'm sad that Susan Oliver had so many trials in life (including Warner Brothers and her mother) but she did well in spite of them all.  I suspect that she may have been an Rh negative blood type, and that would help explain her drive and her personal style.  She did well and no one can take that from her.",1431388800,,582,4.254545454545455
6612673,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"Surprisingly interesting and moving bio of an overlooked actor.

The viewer learns  what an intelligent and gifted woman that Orion dancing girl from Star Trek really was, what a full life she led and what a variety of interests she had, and how sadly she was shunned by a Hollywood system that had no time for a smart and savvy female, on either side of the camera.  Her life was cut short by disease and marred by disappointments great and small, as this DVD makes clear, but Susan Oliver lived it to the fullest and her legacy of film and TV work will outlive us all.  ""The Green Girl"" is a standout among screen biographies and a marvelous tribute to a woman who is much missed.",1421107200,6,845,4.73469387755102

8676454,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"This is a very well-made documentary about a much-overlooked woman, actress, and director. Susan Oliver, as the title says--the Green Girl. Trekkies, myself included, remember her as Vina, the Orian Slave girl persona from the original Star Trek pilot episode. But, she was so much more than just a great actress. Being the victim of Hollywood moguls, Susan never had the honest chance to do what she was very much able to do--direct, write and produce. Instead, she was kept down, which was a crime for her, and for her fans. She was so much more than just a beautiful woman with dazzling blue eyes...she was awesome!

I recommend this DVD not only for screwed-over women everywhere in the post-Harvey Weinstein world, but also for her true fans, and for those who can recognize a tortured soul, who just would not give up. A great work!",1523491200,,838,4.739726027397261
8676455,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"I'm giving this five stars because it captures the reality of intelligent, ambitious women in business -- let alone women in Hollywood. This documentary succeeds in laying out the rules of Hollywood, her ability or inability to work within that system, and the person who was truly born ahead of her time. Told by weaving together her resume, the culture of Hollywood, and who she was as a person and actor through the eyes of amateur and professional experts, friends and family, it stays on task with its clear message: she would have had a different outcome if she was born today. It's a low budget documentary so expect and put up with details like much of the footage of her is (well) captured on a TV screen done. Don't let that put you off. She was a highly accomplished, driven, responsible woman who made very human errors and left an indelible impression on many who worked with her or were her friends. The last minute is as others have said, is a gasp inducing detail, and one of the few times we actually hear her own voice. While it's mostly populated by admiring and sometimes comically frustrated men, highly recommend for those with a curiosity about feminist history. And as many women in the film said, not as much has changed as we hope.",1515369600,,1257,4.591111111111111

8676460,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"In the 1950s and all through the 1960s, it was almost impossible to turn on the television and not see actress Susan Oliver guest starring in one TV show after another. She was a highly sought after young actress who had an almost otherworldly angelic appearance with her blond hair, beautiful skin and very startling blue eyes. What was impossible to believe and harder to explain was why the movie roles didn't come her way. She did some movies but not the kind of high quality movies an actress of her stature deserved. Don't be fooled by the fact Susan was blond and blue eyed. She was young and smart as a whip. She was a skilled airplane pilot, having the certification, I believe, for flying a commercial airline. How many women could say they could do that? In the 1960s or 1970s?  Susan's downfall as a movie actress, apparently, was passing on a role for a movie so she could appear on the stage. This was back in the day after the studios had presumably lost their power to hold actors and actresses to long term contracts and dictate what movies they could or would appear in or not appear in.

So, Susan had the occasional movie role and the occasional guest starring role on television. Once you saw her, she made an impression on you. And if you saw her name in the credits of the television shows she appeared in, you made it a point of watching that TV show. Same for any movie she was in. However, Susan not only passed on a movie, she also passed on doing a television series that could've made her more of a household name. Like a lot of young people of her time and afterwards, she demanded success on her own terms. Later on, when her acting career was on the downhill slide, she turned to directing shows. including an episode of ""M*A*S*H.""

But, all the while, Susan Oliver remained an enigma, even among her diehard fans (including yours truly). Susan, a chain smoker, died of lung cancer in 1990 at age 58. becoming more of an enigma because there were no biographies out there. She didn't deserve to be forgotten like that. The documentary ""The Green Girl"" is the first biography (in video form) exploring who Susan was, and it may be the only biography, though I can't imagine that. Some have complained about what this video doesn't have in trying to document Susan's life, though given the stage of her life most people are interested in is now going on 50 to 60 years ago, the number of people who could provide some detail to what her life isn't a large number and shrinks every year. One can find fault with everything. As a fan of Susan Oliver's, this documentary will do until something better comes along.  And even then, the video disc is worth having because of the footage there is of the beautiful lady. And what a beautiful lady she was!

By the way, regarding Susan's age, up until her death, her year of birth was given in the yearly almanacs as 1937. That information was supplied by the studios, agents and managers. And while it's not surprising a manager or she shaved off five years of her life, at some point, most actors and actresses give on the charade and fess up to what their actual year of birth was and how old they really are. I never did see any mention of Susan being born in 1932 until after her death. And even then, some were claiming she was even older, claiming she was born in 1928. Apparently, some just can't conceive there might be two or more people with the same name. Susan was born Charlotte Gerckes, taking her mother's maiden name and changing her name to Susan to make her a more commercial actress. But, whether you do or don't buy this documentary (buy it!), if you see a rerun of an old TV show or movie from the 50s and 60s with Susan in it, watch it. You can't help but be impressed.",1491264000,3,3764,4.425685425685426

8676462,5,B00N6ZVQ18,"Wow--I agree with some other reviewers that it might be a bit lacking in terms of getting into Susan Oliver's head as far as what made her tick.  You are left, as the filmmakers are, to kind of infer that.  But I think this fault is more due to her playing cards close to the vest rather than a lack of effort on their part.  It is a bit ""IMDB-ish"" up front (thorough illustration of cataloging her work in the beginning of the film that almost makes you say, okay, she was in quite a bit, I get it) but makes up for that on the back end.  Definitely enough there to give you a good picture of her life and her motivations, and quite powerful.  Great work in bringing attention to someone who is gone, shouldn't be forgotten, and that just like anyone else she was a person who had their own desires and dreams and wasn't able to fully achieve them through no fault of her own, and certainly not thorough a lack of ability and drive.  I had a crush on her from when I was little and saw her in many things and now I know it was totally justified.",1485043200,,1046,4.102941176470588
