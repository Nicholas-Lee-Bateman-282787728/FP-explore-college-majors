6407769,5,B00K8GXBMK,"I quickly became addicted to this show and have watched every episode on this site. The 22 minute format is great because the true stories are effectively told but not drawn out too long with unnecessary details. I feel this entire series should be required study for all citizens going into ANY career related to law, law enforcement, social work, sociology, psychology, political science, emergency services, security and detective work, etc. It has changed my view of the world and reduced whatever levels of rose-coloring are still in my glasses. People who have a too-liberal political slant will, I believe, especially benefit from watching this series even though it will ""push their buttons"" and be difficult at times.",1485388800,,726,5.161016949152542

6407797,5,B00K8GXBMK,I love the narration of each episode and how important the smallest of clues can be to solving a case. I would think a lot more unsolved cases could be solved using some of the techniques and technology they have demonstrated on this show.,1484006400,,239,4.454545454545454
6407798,4,B00K8GXBMK,"This series delves into older (read here: solved) cases and how science (forensics) helped the police solve those cases and bring the guilty party to justice. The solving methods and crimes are varied, they do tend towards the more violent crimes. Having said that I have seen at least one case that involved computers and how they solved the case using digital forensics. Yes, they do make sure to include the human side of things, and they do a good job of not giving away the answer to whodunnit too early, but it is still a reality-based crime show.",1484006400,,553,4.595959595959596

6407855,5,B00K8GXBMK,"This is a terrific series.  Extremely informative.  Bad guys will use it to try to avoid being detected.  But, it seems, you always leave something behind that points to you as the culprit of a crime and you can get caught far more quickly than you realize, no matter how well you cover your tracks.  Forensic evidence and modern technology and creative minds will nab you every time.  Just not too long ago, juries did not understand forensic science.  The case of OJ Simpson was a case where people became reluctant to believe in it completely.  Now, juries look forward to 'following' the evidence.  Many of these cases happened before the OJ trial, yet, forensic  science was used, o(f course, since that is the title of the series).  Forensic science that eventually  proved guilt with the bad guy getting his comeuppance.  But it takes skill when presenting this type of evidence.  And it takes greater skill in finding it.  It is always there, it just requires patience, a lot of thought and the latest technology to find it.  I love the way each episode was presented.  Never dumbing it down for the audience.  Taking us each step of the way to find out what happened and why.  This is one of the better--probably the best--crime evidence shows ever made.  To the people who put it together (that definitely took work and time, too), thank you, all of you for bringing us true stories of the amazing strides made in forensic science that is not theory, but proven fact!  Well done!",1479340800,,1489,4.653846153846154

Personally, I'd keep some kids, maybe up to 12-14, away, it can be a bit gruesome. Don't get me wrong, it's not shock type, just facts can be nasty sometimes.

You'll find contradictions in the narrative, errors in placement of photos, and gaping holes in the stories. Just follow up on some episodes' cases and you'll find that a great deal has.been omitted or altered in these stories.

The conviction of the person, although, I would react similar is in my opinion not beyond doubt. Nobody saw the driver, yes the vehicle was involved beyond a doubt, but who dove it? Did anybody place the convicted person behind the wheel? Apparently he had a pretty good record with driving intoxicated and was caught several times.
I just don't know, I guess it is in the wording ""beyond a REASONABLE doubt""",1467331200,,538,4.663157894736842

6408205,5,B00K8GXBMK,"Forensic Files started as a binge watch program that I only watched when I was travelling and in the hotel room.
There would be marathon sessions on whatever channel it was on, and I'd stay up for hours into the early morning watching them back to back.
On a recent trip, I started googling about the program and eventually discovered that it was also available on prime (not all the full seasons but the ""best of"" of the seasons).

I was in heaven...the show is totally addicting. It's not a big deal for me that there are a few episodes missing, because quite frankly, I haven't even noticed - there's a HUGE collection here. All of them are worthy of binge watching, but I have been skipping around a bit. After reading some of the previews, there are some that sound more interesting than others, but they all impress.

The VO is tremendous and emotional when it needs to be. Sometimes I giggle when I shouldn't, but such is the show.

The program takes us through a crime and the forensic science that figures it all out. In many cases you will find that the people in these cases have gone on to do great things (trust me, google them). It's a fascinating look into the science behind the cases.

Binge Worthy programming in every season. You're welcome.",1454976000,3,1260,4.5131578947368425

As for the episodes, I couldn't watch more than two before the blurriness of the Picture gave me a headache. I've never met a Forensic Files episode that didn't like. Definitely not buying anymore from Film Rise.",1440547200,,500,4.319148936170213

He and Bill Kurtis of Cold Case Files are the two premier narrators around, of crime solving shows in my opinion. The technical values of the series are a labor of love, obviously. For the most part, the real people involved are on camera in interviews, and it lends an authenticity to every episode. Just great stuff. But at times,very sad at what bad people are capable of, especially when it comes to children.",1438041600,,504,4.611111111111111

Each episode is a lesson on how to reduce one's chances for becoming a victim but by the same token shows that sometimes being a victim is unavoidable.  I have never been able to understand how someone could take another's life and through watching these shows I realize that there truly is just plain evil in this world.,1419206400,,533,4.648936170212766

Interstate 97 or I 97 is in Maryland
US Route 97 runs through part of California, Oregon and Washington.
In the first episode of season 9 they keep incorrectly referring to I 97 or Interstate 97, when they should really say ROUTE 97! (Although the highway does run in 3 states and is therefore technically ""interstate""... hmm...)",1406246400,,576,4.702970297029703

6408668,5,B00K8GXBMK,This is my favorite show of this typebar none. The episodes are short--only about 22 minutes or so--but very interesting. I'd love it if Amazon would make more available. Many seasons only have 6 episodes. One season has 20+ episodes! Love it!,1403740800,,243,4.809523809523809

6408672,5,B00K8GXBMK,I love actual cases of how science forensics has changed so much and helps so much to be PROVEN.  Eye witness accounts differ.  People have their own agenda and fears.  But when it is science and can't be faked it is amazing.  I only wish we could do this faster and cheaper so some people don't sit in prison for months and years before it can be proven they were innocent.  Particularly when they have already exhausted funds for attorneys and it costs upwards of $5000 for some DNA testing and it won't be done free.,1403136000,,519,4.364583333333333
6408673,4,B00K8GXBMK,"These stories are especially gruesome--child murders/rapes, teenage killers, etc. I like that the information isn't repeated over and over again like on Dateline or 48 Hours Mystery; the producers seem to believe the audience has reasoning skills. Really good for the genre but some very disturbing episodes.",1402876800,5,308,5.574468085106383

6408675,5,B00K8GXBMK,"I've been watching Forensic Files on Cable TV for many years...long before Amazon Fire was even thought of, so I'm not really sure why this even requires a review.

But with that having been said, it's nice to be able to watch this show without having to deal with 10 - 18 commercials every 6 - 7 minutes while watching this, and every other show.

Watching Forensic Files is about the latest in forensics, and is likely to convince anyone not to go out and commit a crime!",1402876800,,473,4.363636363636363
6408676,4,B00K8GXBMK,"When I'm a little sad or depressed, I put on this TV show because it distracts me and also makes me count my blessings that I am alive.  I usually watch it while I'm falling asleep, because it's a good balance of interesting/boring - interesting enough to make me try to halfheartedly watch it, but boring enough that when I start to fall asleep I'm okay with the missing the rest of the episode.",1402876800,,396,4.351351351351352

6408690,4,B00K8GXBMK,"I am a pretty big fan of this kind of show and i tend to watch the shows that follow true crime. i always liked watching and reading Sherlock Holmes when i was a kid. Looking for subtle clues and piecing together an evidence puzzle is fascinating stuff to me. These shows follow that process. It is a reality show without a star (the studies, methods and processes are the stars -- along with the police and forensic scientists). Finding the truth to help others live and die with as much dignity as possible. Yes, I like these shows very much.",1401926400,,544,4.396039603960396
8656815,5,B00K8GXBMK,"Even in the year 2017, cities still lack the seriousness of controlling ""outsiders"" such as those people who are bussed from larger cities posing as legitimate salespeople. This particular episode, ""Death by a Salesman"" was absolutely spectacular! The FBI working this case proved to be top notch individuals who were able to follow up on leads that could have been inconclusive. I can only say, I hope with all my heart that if I ever need a team of investigators to solve my case, that it will be this FBI team. I am in awe of such smart, clever, intuitive people! God bless these men and women who have been given that talent.
In general, this program,""Forensic Files"" is one of the very best crime shows ever; it is my favorite. The events are so organized and well put together. I learn so much from these crime programs, such as why to NEVER, EVER leave your doors unlocked, no matter how much easier it is for a family member. These events tell us that there is no such thing as, ""Oh, it will be okay. Who would have the nerve to enter?"" Now we know, which is why I like these kinds of programs so much. On 19 June 2018, I splurged (very expensive) and persisted in having a great camera security-alarm system in place, in my home, even though I live in a very small, but still insecure city in AZ. I can go to my mailbox and if need be, I can press the red button and expect an immediate response from the local police. I feel very safe now. I pray every day that our first responders will be looked after, given the respect they deserve and saved from personal harm. They are truly heroic.",1531440000,,1598,4.365771812080537
8656816,1,B00K8GXBMK,"I enjoyed most of these episodes as I would have trained in law enforcement if I hadn't become an RN instead. To me these are similar professions for several reasons but I won't go into them here. BUT, I do not get the supposedly "" trained"" 911 operators! The callers are screaming for help or fright because they are being attacked and these operators are asking stupid questions like ""what are they wearing or can you describe them?"" I hope these operators are fired or at the very least get reprimanded and forced to get more training.",1527379200,,538,4.556701030927835
