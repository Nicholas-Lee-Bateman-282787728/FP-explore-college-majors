8072140,4,B000A1IM4K,"This is a good family film with problems highlighted in several areas.  However, I found it incomplete, since it left several issues unresolved, especially the future of the clinic.",1423958400,,181,5.241379310344827
8072141,4,B000A1IM4K,"In a small town in the Pacific Northwest, newly-minted veterinarian Andrew MacDonald (Jonathan Scarfe) has just arrived to begin working at an animal clinic run by his idol, one-time research vet Cyrus Gachet (Mike Farrell).  His first day on the job is almost an unmitigated disaster: faced with animals in need, he knows exactly what to do, but still he gets scratched by a cat and kicked by a horse, runs afoul of his co-workers like a ship adrift in a crowded harbor, and ends the day by hitting a deer and running his car into a fence--which, in turn, brings his girlfriend Sarah (Pascale Hutton) 1000 miles from school to be with him and precipitates a crisis in their relationship.  Meanwhile Dr. Gachet tries to cope with an unfriendly City Councilwoman (Maureen Jones) and learn how a pet cat suffered a traumatic injury, and Kyle Southern (Sebastian Spence), who specializes in large animals and exotics, struggles to define his relationship with Emma Matthews (Ione Skye), who he thinks is attracted to Andrew.

Originally aired on Animal Planet, this movie reminds me of classic doctors-in-a-human-hospital TV with its several simultaneous threads and frequent intercutting; the animals add a fresh angle to the personal and interpersonal problems of the staff, although of course we know what choice Andrew will make in the end.  Nothing is too gory for sensitive kids, though there is a lost life, and the story is involving.",1287446400,3,1439,4.983333333333333
8072142,5,B000A1IM4K,"First saw this film on ANIMAL PLANET television, watching with a young niece and nephew.  They loved the film and wanted a copy on DVD, so we watched for the release.  I didn't realize at first, but we discovered that some of the creators of the enchanting ""AIR BUD"" series were responsible for ANIMAL CLINIC, which explains a lot about why this is such an enjoyable film.  Great cast (lots of recognized faces, such as Bruce Davison from the ""Spiderman"" films, or Mike Farrell from ""MASH"").  Really a great movie to add to your collection if you like family films, animal films, Disney or Pixar style entertainment themes.",1202083200,4,623,4.7407407407407405
8072143,2,B000A1IM4K,"This is a bland movie that might have served its purpose as an after-school TV program. But it doesn't make it as a feature film out on DVD. I had hoped it might add a few updated insights into the drama of veterinary practice, since it's been some decades since the ""All Creatures Great and Small"" series first aired.

But ""Animal Clinic"" doesn't bring anything new to the operating table. It is formulaic. A struggling independent clinic is threatened with closure. There's a crusty veteran veterinarian running the clinic and a newbie who has to overcome his colleagues' doubts about his abilities.

Furthermore, the movie was obviously shot on low budget. None of the operations look the least bit real. For each procedure, we just see a draped form with a bit of fur protruding and some speckles and gouts of what is supposedly blood.

Mike Farrell, who plays the presiding Doctor, again leans over the operating table as he did for many seasons in ""MASH."" But he doesn't deliver any incisive back comedy here. Nor is there any of the gentler humor of idiosyncrasy or the really educational specification of disease symptoms that characterized the ""Creatures Great and Small"" episodes. So this movie is neither fish nor fowl.

If you want to experience the drama of being a veterinarian, it is still by far best to check out Herriot's classic series. Or better yet, read James Herriot's books.",1181606400,4,1398,4.836820083682008
