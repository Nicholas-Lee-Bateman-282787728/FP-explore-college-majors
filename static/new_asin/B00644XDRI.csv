Nothing more, I could watch it online, but the definition was bad and my daughter wants to watch it all the time.  It was a good price and Amazon refunded me a dollar when the price decreased.  Over all a good buy.",1333324800,6,344,4.074626865671642
4948824,1,B00644XDRI,"There are only 2 episodes on the DVD. My 6 yr old loves the two episodes, but most of the DVD is contained as clips for FREE on the website for Ninjago. Very displeased. Someone else reviewed that there were 4 episodes. Which ones were those? I am confused by the comments that were made before the release date as well.",1333324800,2,320,4.262295081967213

4948826,2,B00644XDRI,"The show is great, and my son loves it and he loves the Ninjago toys.  I would rate the quality of the animation and story between 4 and 5 stars.  The value of this DVD, however, I would rate as a 1.

Regarding Amazon's product page and the reviews - I'm not sure what others are reviewing, but from what I understand the DVD release of this title was 3/27/2012, meaning months-old reviews are a little suspect.  If it was previously released, I was unaware.  Thinking it was brand new and contained the first 1/2 of the current season, I pre ordered it from my phone.  I should have looked closer or looked on my computer to see that it is only 44 minutes long.  It is just wrong to charge $10 for two episodes of a cartoon designed to market toys and and video games to young children.  Cartoon Network and Lego and whoever produces the show have already earned advertising money for these episodes and Lego has sold quite a few $20 to $80 building sets based on vehicles and characters in the series.

We've gotten HOURS more Lego content on the FREE DVDs that come with the FREE Lego Club magazine than is contained on this disc for $10.  To add insult to injury, today (the release date and the day I received it) I see it's gone from the price I paid, $9.99+tax, down to $8.99+tax.  I certainly hope Amazon honors the price guarantee for pre-orders, that will take some of the sting out of this rip-off DVD.",1332806400,5,1413,4.354961832061068

4948829,4,B00644XDRI,"Both, my 7 and 9 years old kids have been big fans of the Lego Ninja Lego so i was very exicted to buy them that DVD.
By the way I purchased it brand new at ToyRus for $12.99 on their website.
What I like:
The story explains well how all the charaters came to be what they are today. The animation is great and the dialogues funny and very entertaining .
What I do not like :
There are only 2 episodes so the Dvd is not long.
Episode one explains how the two bothers Seinsi and Garmadon  went separate ways and how Sensei had to find the four Ninjas.
episodes two introduced the 4 dragons and how the Ninjas were able to go in the underworld to rescue Nya.
That is it.
If you have been watching some of the clips avalaible on the Lego website they are exictly the same in the DVD.
Also in Mid January the Cartoon Network will preview THE CARTOON of Ninjago.
I am guessing it will be the same as the DVD.
In summary:
For 12 dollars my kids got to watch it plenty of times during their Xmas break. That was worth it for me.
Now if you want to record the episodes from the Cartoon network then you will be save the money.
I hope this help.",1324598400,65,1136,4.004405286343612

4948832,1,B00644XDRI,"My 5 year old loves this cartoon. I thought it must be good, since it's just Lego, right?

I sat down long enough to watch with him today.  I was shocked first at the constant violence. Then I noticed that ALL the Lego people bad guys had dark black faces and sharp teeth! All the good Lego people are yellow(Asian?). Later, all the black faced Lego people turned yellow and were good guys again. I am white, and this is so offensive. All the more so since my grandson is biracial, and he tolerates and even approves it! We had a conversation on the subject. I explained to him that the two ethnicities that brutalized Asian(Chinese) people the most in the last couple hundred years were white(British) and Asian(Japanese). Why, then, are the bad guys in this cartoon depicted as black and very scary and evil? Is this done because the American people LIKE to believe it? I highly recommend that all the parents that read this watch the documentary Ethnic Notions. See why and how this sort of imagery has been used in our country, for profit and influence and oppression. Will we ever examine our racial attitudes? Please, this is 2015, it's about time we did so.",1442620800,,1164,4.564593301435407

For those looking for French, though - you are in luck - they didn't lie about that one.  I SO wish the description were accurate - you can't return opened DVD's!",1439251200,,384,4.394366197183099
4948836,5,B00644XDRI,"Disclaimer: Contains minor spoilers for the rest of the series.

One day I was at Target and just for the heck of it, I bought a small $5 Lego set with a neat looking Ninja in it for nostalgia's sake. I grew up with Legos, but by 2011 I had mostly grown out of it. The name on the set was, ""Ninjago"" and it stuck in my head because it's so silly.
Not too long later, I saw that, ""Ninjago"" was being shown on the Cartoon Network, and I was curious because I thought to myself, "" Surely that silly Lego set didn't get its own show. . ."" But it did. And it's utterly ridiculous.
At least that was my first impression. The story was not very engrossing and I saw it as a cheap cash-in, and I almost immediately forgot about the whole thing.
Later, season one aired. I found myself continually coming back to the series for no reason I could figure out; perhaps the silliness of it all just kept me coming back. Over time (by that I mean the middle of the second season) I realized that there MUST be a good reason I'm watching every episode as it airs. I can't just be wasting my time on this. There's got to be a reason.
I finally found the reason. It's something I always rejected first when I was trying to figure it all out in past attempts. This show is excellent. This show teaches you things. And most importantly this show has great characters.
Kai is here to tell you that there is no shame in being in last place. He's the last ninja to join Sensei Wu; he's last to gain spinjitzu; and he's last to find his true potential. But he's still strong, he keeps on fighting, and he lets nothing stop him.
Jay is here to tell you that even from the lowest beginnings you can achieve greatness. He was raised in a junkyard by his parents, yet he's still one of the strongest people on this fictional planet.
Cole is here to tell you that no matter what happens to you, you will always find a way to continue on. He gets turned into a ghost in the fifth season, and he never let that slow him down.
Zane is here to tell us that no matter how different you are, no matter the difference, you will always be accepted by someone. He's revealed to be a robot early on in the series, and everyone accepts him for what he is immediately.
Lloyd is here to tell us that no matter how you were raised to act, you can always adjust yourself and be the best you can possibly be. He's the son of the ultimate evil, but he doesn't let that keep him from being the Chosen One to bring Ninjago to peace.
And Sensei Wu teaches us that you must never give up on the ones you love. He helps bring his brother back from evil. He is constantly finding the next way to save his family and the people of his home.

This show is great. I've watched every episode as it's aired and I have never felt disappointed. Give this show a shot, and start here; at the beginning.",1436659200,,2843,4.139240506329114

The female character in this isn't quite as strong and independant as she becomes in the series, but I'm the only one who seemed to mind the stereotypes.
