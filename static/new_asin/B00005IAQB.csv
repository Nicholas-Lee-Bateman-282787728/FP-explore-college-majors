1428651,5,B00005IAQB,"This wonderful documentary follows a small herd of elephants through a dry season. The series is narrated in first-person ""by"" an elephant (Avery Brooks)

The blu-ray quality is first rate with crystal clear images. Easily some of the best blues and greens I have seen on DVD. There are some great shots, including footage of a matriarch charging the camera. There were also several sad scenes in which the herd attempted to literally prop up a dead or dying elephant, showing the strength of emotional bonds between elephants.

My only complaint is that the documentary is pretty short (40 minutes), especially for the price. I would recommend renting it, unless you are a true elephant fanatic.",1245369600,8,696,4.991379310344827
1428652,4,B00005IAQB,"My wife and I saw this IMAX movie back in 1998 when it debuted on the IMAX screens.  You lose a bit of the impact seeing it just on a TV, although I get the feeling that it will look pretty awesome on an HDTV.
Anyway, the IMAX film follows an elephant clan through one season, having to weather drought, etc.  There's a heartbreaking scene where the clan comes across another female elephant whose calf has died.
But the real reason to get this DVD is for the ""Making of"" documentary.  This is fascinating!  It's chock full of details about IMAX, like the fact that one single frame of an IMAX film is the equivalent of two 70 mm frames put together; it's got about **ten** times the level of detail that a 35 mm frame has.  Not only that, the documentary shows how they got the elephants used to their presence so that they could film them.  It explains how the sound that you hear isn't actually contemporaneous with the picture, because the IMAX camera is so loud it would drown out a lot of ambient sound.",1044576000,,1009,4.340425531914893

1428654,4,B00005IAQB,"The documentary isn't the only great thing on this DVD... you should see the ""Making off""... Great images (I don't think someone will ever get on film an elephant charging as the one on this documentary - I saw this film in a theatre in Cape Town and I'm still holding my breath). The story is Ok...
If you love elephants or Africa... this is a must have !!!!!",1000684800,14,360,4.231884057971015

7938562,5,B00005IAQB,"I have a 12 year old grandson who is autistic.  If you check your records, you will see I have ordered several over the past few years.  He loves this movie.  I now have 2 spare here at my house...He has one at his house....cause when one breaks (gets stepped on, etc.) we had better have another copy somewhere.  Needless to say, there is something about this movie that he loves....that's good enough for me.",1443398400,,410,4.426666666666667

7938567,4,B00005IAQB,"I saw this in the theater and, being a lover of African elephants, enjoyed. ALL made-for-IMAX flicks follow pretty much the same formula: do not exceed 35-45 minutes, keep the family with young children in mind and therefore keep learning level light, include conservation message when applicable as well as visually engaging images. . . When a baby elephant collapses from exhaustion, for example from thirst, the mama takes her leg and tries to push and encourage her baby to get up. Be advised that there is an intensely tear-jerking scene in which the mama tries but the baby is dead. It's a really tough scene and I can't take it although an adult; I would not want a young child to see it.",1344556800,,695,4.612903225806452
7938568,4,B00005IAQB,I like this video.  The picture qaulity and sound were great.  The only part that I did not like is that this video could be a little longer.  It is a little too short for a documentary.,1264809600,,186,3.972972972972973
7938569,1,B00005IAQB,This blu-ray can pride itself on being the shortest bluray ever. At only 40m it needs to be under 5 bucks. I want to buy this but maybe they should combine it with other documentary on same disc or put in a box set at a reasonable price.,1262995200,,237,3.9583333333333335
7938570,5,B00005IAQB,"i've watched this dvd 4 or 5 times already and am convinced that this beautiful animal is the wisest animal in creation, there ability to remember so many trails to better grazing areas astounds me,there friendliness to each is wonderful to see, why cant people be likewise.  i particularly loved watching the baby ones, what fun and joy they show you. we are very fortunate having these amazing cameramen creating these  fabulous series for us all. make sure you purchase a copy , you won't be sorry",1258156800,2,500,4.735632183908046
