2179027,5,B00068OSVI,"Bresson's masterwork, enigmatic, exhalting, exhilerating and frustrating in equal measures, has arrived on DVD in a sterling new transfer from Criterion.  I've seen this film three or four times previously over the years, and it's always left me cold, as does much later Bresson.  But I was blown away when I watched it again last night, in tears and spent at the end, and haven't been able to stop thinking about it today.  No point in a synopsis; the story's hardly the interest here.  Bresson's brilliant technique, and clear moral perspective, fascinate.  If you're intrigued by what you know of the film, I'd encourage you to give it a chance.  Think I've finally joined the ranks of the converted.",1121212800,10,703,4.8655462184873945
2179028,5,B00068OSVI,"Au Hasard Balthazar is a profound masterpiece, one of the greatest cinematic artworks (or, simply, artworks) of the twentieth century.  I'm not original in saying this: simply do some research and you'll discover how many learned and experienced film experts have praised the greatness of this film.

I will offer this advice, however: all you should need to read to urge you to view this film is Jeff Shannon's superb editorial review above.  All I knew before first watching this film was that I loved the other films of Bresson I had seen and that film experts considered this work to be a masterpiece.  Fortunately I didn't know anything else about it (except for, perhaps, a cursory outline of the story) and most fortunately I didn't know anything about the ending.  So my advice to you is: DO NOT READ ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS FILM.  Just watch it.  You do not want to read anything that talks about the ending (and I won't say a word about it here myself).  Just watch the film.  There will be plenty of time to read the many excellent essays on the film out there after you have watched it (...).

Others have mentioned the extras that come on the disc.  They are indeed excellent.  Also, the transfer is exceptionally beautiful (from the Criterion website: ""This new, high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from the 35mm camera negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System. To maintain optimal image quality through the compression process, the picture on this dual-layer DVD-9 was encoded at the highest-possible bit rate for the quantity of materials included"").  Just how good the transfer is (and how good the subtitles are) can be proved when you watch the special feature, ""Un metteur en ordre: Robert Bresson,"" a 1966 French television show about the film, featuring Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Louis Malle, and members of Balthazar's cast and crew that is included.  When they show clips from the film during this feature, you can compare them to the transfer of the film on the disc.  There really is no comparison: the print on the disc is crisp and pristine, with beautifully clear subtitles; the clips from the print in the special feature are grainy, hazy, and the subtitles are occasionally difficult to read.  In other words, the new, restored high-definition digital transfer is truly spectacular.

There is nothing more to be said.  This film is a masterpiece.  Buy this DVD or borrow it from a friend, and watch this film as soon as you can.  If everyone in the world watched it, what a world we'd be living in.",1119139200,30,2637,4.830734966592428
2179029,5,B00068OSVI,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, Jean-Luc Godard famously remarked  that Robert Bresson's brilliant film 'Au Hasard Balthazar' showed 'the world in an hour and a half.' A perfect review of a stunning film. Bresson is widely regarded as a true master of the cinema by film buffs and 'Balthazar' just may be the pinnacle of his career.

Bresson was (in)famous for his unique style of filmmaking. By the time he directed 'Balthazar', Bresson had perfected it to such a degree, that this film stands as the most perfect expression of his unique vision of the world. Bresson is not a easy 'watch'. Rather than show you everything or tell you how to feel, he makes the view work for their rewards. And indeed, watching a Bresson film is a rewarding experience.  None more so than 'Au Hasard Balthazar'.

By now you know that the film is 'about' the life of a donkey and it's various owners. But it's about so much more than that. It is a deeply mysterious film that only deepens the more you watch it. Indeed, watching this film is a transcendental experience. I don't want to reveal too much more, you just have to see the film for yourself and decide.

As for the Criterion DVD, there is a reason they have earned their reputation as the 'Rolls Royce' of DVD comapanies.  It is superb. The transfer to DVD is stunning. Seeing the re-release of this film on the big screen last year was the single most memorable cinematic event of 2004 for me, but the Criterion transfer actually improves on it! Beautiful work. Although the number of extras on the disc is small, they are terrific. The best is the inclusion of a 1966 French TV program with Bresson, Godard, Louis Malle and others discussing this film.

'Au Hasard Balthazar' is definitely in my Top Ten Greatest Films of All Time list and to see Criterion do it justice is terrific. If you have any serious interest in film and have yet to see this, then go and pick this disc up.",1119139200,10,1929,4.54178674351585
2179030,4,B00068OSVI,"I can't say I got this film on 1st viewing. But somehow I was in tears at the end anyway. Very moving - but I defy you to say why. Truly one of the most affecting ""affectless"" films ever. Reminds me of Godard (of course) and maybe some Truffaut, but really like nothing else. Scary good.",1118966400,7,287,4.142857142857143
2179031,5,B00068OSVI,"To earth we are born and to earth we are put to rest.  What happens in between is the journey of life through which events and actions guide our lives.  From events and actions, we draw experience from and build an understanding of the world.  These experiences either adapt, or assimilate to previous experiences that have changed our existence.  The constantly changing knowledge and wisdom accumulates over time and influences the behaviors others perceive or experiences that in turn affects them.  Nonetheless, life continues to move in the direction of personal actions and events that set the course of personal destiny, as actions continue to color each living being's existence.  Robert Bresson captures the journey through Balthazar, a donkey, who functions as a reliable and helpless witness to the events of life.

The first shot of Au Hasard Balthazar displays an infant donkey seeking shelter and food from his mother's bosom amidst a flock of sheep.  Suddenly, a hand reaches in with good intentions to touch the little donkey.  Yet, the scene carries a threatening tone, as a little girl and a boy graze the donkey while asking an adult if they can have the donkey.  At first, the man says ""Impossible, children.""  However, the following scene shows that he changed his mind where he runs down hill with the children and the donkey.  The scene provides a suggestive hint towards the corruption of innocence, as they remove the baby donkey from the safety of the mother.  Bresson's cinematic genius shines through in this opening scene, as he strips the scene from characters, emotions, and acting.  Instead, he leaves the audience only with the external stimuli in the form of spoken words and actions taken by the individuals in the scene.  A strong sense of detached objectivity seems to radiate in the scene, which continues to linger throughout the film.

The kids, Marie and Jacques, have a baptism for the donkey in which they name him Balthazar.  It is a fun and loving summer for kids who playfully connect around the little donkey, as they swarm around him with hugs and caress.  Eventually, the summer ends and the kids must depart from one another leaving Balthazar in the hands of other less loving and caring.  Here Bresson depicts the other side of humanity, the malevolent and cruel natures, which seem to derive from people's own selfish goals.  The emotional coldness continues while illustrating the harshness with which Balthazar's owners beat him into submission.  This leads the donkey into years of hard manual labor where he pulls wagons, plows fields, and tows logs.  Balthazar's life with the kids is now a mere memory slipping into oblivion where his current life only experiences whips and sticks that roughly touch his beaten body.

After years of abusive living, Balthazar escapes after an accident, as he once again returns to the house where the kids once treated him with warm affection.  The years have not been fortunate to those who used to live there, as the house now is up for sale and vicious rumors are spreading that the old teacher, Marie's father who is the caretaker, has swindled the owner.  In pride, Marie's father refuses to produce any evidence, as it all rests on hearsay.  Despite the family difficulty, a grown Marie (Anne Wiazemsky) does not hesitate to care for Balthazar, but this time the viewers can see Marie's life change for the worse.  Strong comparisons between Balthazar and Marie emerge through Bresson's illustrious directing that presents the progress of how Marie falls victim to circumstance and wicked behavior.  It leads the audience into a venture where Marie falls into bad company and experiences another form of abuse, which the film suggests through several scenes with Bresson's brilliant eye for how to frame each scene.

Through the abusive occurrences that both Balthazar and Marie experience they develop a connection between their destinies.  This connection rests within the cruelty of humanity and the vile deeds of the characters around them.  The abusiveness receives an intricate analysis through socioeconomic, Catholic, and moral undertones, as Bresson does not simply play on one specific aspect of society, but on all.  One of the common interpretations draws to the analogous use of the two protagonists that emerge with Christ-like appearance, as they suffer for the sins of all the characters around them.  Nonetheless, the social and psychological implications of consequences are relevant to the story, as they lead to further deeds and consequences.  Lastly, the moral dilemmas presented in the film might seem heavily influenced by the Catholic Church with the use of the seven deadly sins and sacraments.  Yet, it displays an understanding beyond pious beliefs that transcends the experiences to a more universal plane than mere Catholicism, as the film deals with the idea of destiny.

A very important aspect of the Au Hasard Balthazar is that the actors do not perform in the film - they do.  This notion suggests that the actions of the characters becomes the characters and words have lost their meaning, as the words do not correlate with the deeds.  Bresson's attention to perfection is evident while the film gives the impression of an artistic collage where each scene could very well have become an infamous piece of art.  The audience gets the pleasure to follow 24 frames per second, which displays a majestic venture through living and breathing art.  Au Hasard Balthazar begins with innocent youth that travels through devious and hazardous terrain, which ultimately ends where it once began.  In full circle, Bresson's black and white film succeeds in multicolor palette portrayal of the diversity of humanity where no one is without transgressions and all should contemplate their own existence before parting with it.",1118880000,15,5848,5.081675392670157
2179032,5,B00068OSVI,"But who am i?

I just watched this movie for the first time. I had seen 'Diary of a Country Priest' and 'A Man Escaped'. However, neither of these films adequately prepared me for the emotional experience I confronted with this film which is, in a way, about a donkey. I say -in a way- because it is also about so many other things - love, death, religon, deceit, modernization, sorrow, etc. This overwhelming combination of both simplicity and complexity though common to many Bresson films is so powerful in Balthazar that at times we feel we have transcended film. It is more like a look inside Bresson's spirit than it is like watching a movie. I don't meen spirit in the christian sense - but more of a transcendental view of the world - as Bresson's film is so much about detail - detail of sound and image. I can only say that my personal experience of this film was overwhelming and powerful - I hope that others can experience this as well.",1118880000,19,949,4.454022988505747
2179033,5,B00068OSVI,"with few peers. This is one of the greatest films of all time.

The other review about coldness here is pretty hilarious. Bresson's early Notes on Cinematography points in this direction: an attack on the dramatic. It's why he doesn't use actors. The question is, though, if this film is so cold, how come it would take a catatonic to avoid feeling wretchedly spent when it's over? Perhaps part of the answer is that the warmer, hammy dramatic approach is the easy way. This is an exercise in testing your flinch reflexes. And seeing if you can feel without having to understand. Accusing Bresson of being polemical (or didactic) is so far off base it's scary. As perhaps no one else, he plods forward with few devices and yet manages to wager devastating effect.",1116979200,16,763,4.6940298507462686
2179034,3,B00068OSVI,"ok, bresson is regarded as one of the modern masters of cinema. but i have a lot of problems watching his films. when i saw mouchette, i couldn't believe whta i was watching. it was a cold film, it left me breathless. i loved it. and the came the devil probably. the coldness became stupidness. it was a critic to modern society but really stupid, i guess. it was like ""im trying to teach you something""

and then came balthazar. the coldness was too much. i didn't get involved in the movie. i was a watcher. that can be nice sometimes, but it turned out to be boring. the story is too cut apart. i thought that scorsese and 21 grams had problems creating atmospheres cause they cut too much and their story isn't well crafted. and then i saw balthazar.

ok, maybe it wasn't for me. i just don't know what it was. i just think it lacks many things. u feel bresson hasn't commited to his work. or at least i felt it. i just think it TOO cold. but its just an opinnion",1116288000,5,967,4.193548387096774
2179035,5,B00068OSVI,"Supposedly, this DVD has as good a transfer as the one recently produced in the UK, which looked fantastic.  Not that it matters to me.  My third-generation VHS dub is the most important film I have, and I would accept anything.

It's not a film for everyone.  Many discard it, some loathe it, and they're all correct, too.  But for those it reaches...well, best to see it without expectations.  I couldn't watch another movie for months after seeing this.  What would the point be?  As Godard said, it's the world in an hour and a half.",1114905600,50,537,4.520833333333333
2179056,5,B00068OSVI,"I am not a big Bresson fan, but I have to say that everything that's irritating or mannered in his other movies just works like magic in this one. You'll cry at the end, most likely, and, if you watch it again, you'll cry at the beginning, too.",1464220800,3,244,4.104166666666667
2179057,4,B00068OSVI,"Yet once again, attack of the killer hype.  Described by many critics and film-fans as one of the best films ever made, I think I simply had heard too much and expected too much when I finally saw the film all these years later.  I had the same problem the first time I saw Citizen Kane.

But even with that slight let down that my life wasn't changed, I saw this as a spare, touching lovely film about the life of an innocent donkey, and the cruelty that surrounds him in the human race.  The metaphor for Christ, or a saint, as Balthazar quietly, and mostly with dignity, accepts whatever life heaps upon him is an extremely creative and interesting way to get one thinking about the issues of acceptance, self-sacrifice, the nature of transcendence, etc.  And by making the main character a donkey, there is both a (good) simplicity, and (ironically) an instant empathy with the main character (one of the many fascinating side questions this film generates; why is it so much easier for humans to be empathetic to an animal than another person?  Even Hitler loved puppies...).

The acing is rough edged at best, with Bresson choosing amateurs and non-actors, which  on first pass  I found a little distracting. But by avoiding the trap of making the film anthropomorphic -- we see lots of close ups of Balthazar quietly watching what goes on around him, but theres never any Disney-type attempt to show him reacting in a human way, or showing emotion -- Bresson keeps the tale from ever for a moment seeming cute or treacly.

Definitely a film to see again.  I suspect, with more realistic expectations I may love the film even more.",1460332800,3,1637,4.649305555555555

Their behavior seems abrupt and illogical to the viewer.  How much more so must it seem to the donkey?

2179086,5,B00068OSVI,"Robert Bresson's revered 1966 masterpiece Au hasard Balthazar is a film of quite extraordinary intellectual depth, piercing metaphysical perception and spiritual profundity. All 13 of this director's films are essential viewing, but this is the one you will want to return to the most to gain fresh insight as so much complexity lies buried under a surface of apparent simplicity. I have seen it many times and find new things on every re-acquaintance. Some people find Bresson's austerity hard to take, but here it is leavened with the use of soft romantic Schubert on the soundtrack (Piano Sonata No. 20), a beautifully warm (defiantly non-model-like) performance from Anne Wiazemsky and a donkey as the main character. The film is undoubtedly one of the greatest ever made and if I prefer A Man Escaped (1956) it is simply a subjective personal choice on my part. There's no question in my mind that Au hasard Balthazar is the greater achievement and critical consensus (though far from unanimous) would appear to agree.

The great beauty of the film lies in the simplicity of the story. Set in rural France, a donkey is born in a stable, has a brief idyllic early life before being put to work by the first of 7 owners. They use and abuse him in various ways before he finally dies in a meadow. On the most obvious level the film is about human cruelty and if you are an animal rights activist you might find this film tough to sit through. The donkey is kicked, poked, hit with a stick, burned, shot, over-burdened with heavy loads, exploited in a circus and used in crime. Furthermore it is witness to various unmentionable acts of cruelty perpetrated by man on fellow man. In true Bressonian style the camera stares at the donkey continually while a myriad of sub-plots happen around it (largely off-screen) with such elliptical subtlety that you definitely won't catch everything on a single viewing. If we watch and listen carefully we can catch a murder, a long-running land dispute, a love story, a smuggling yarn, a rags-to-riches parable, a miser's tale, a meditation on mother-son dysfunction, a dissection of bigoted parochial village life and a disturbing sex attack. In short Bresson encapsulates a whole rural way of life which he shows as being fundamentally evil by refracting it through the poor innocent donkey. Bresson went on to make an even more damning view of the French countryside in his next film Mouchette (1966), another masterpiece, but one that has to be one of the most depressing movies I have ever sat through. The afore-mentioned Schubert merging with the suffering of the poor beast, Au hasard Balthazar avoids that accusation and manages to be astonishingly poignant to the point where I defy anyone with a heart not to be moved to tears by the end.

In Au hazard Balthazar Bresson recognizes that while many films focus on man inflicting cruelty on man, nothing is more moving than seeing it inflicted on an innocent animal. Why can audiences watch bodies blown to bits and limbs hacked off in commercial cinema without turning so much as a hair, and yet feel such concern when an animal is simply prodded with a stick? Could it be that animals are somehow better (closer to God?) than man and one of Bresson's reasons for making this film is to convey his disgust with the nature of mankind? Certainly if we look at the films he went on to make after this we find a progressively stronger misanthropic edge to his work, especially evinced in The Devil Probably (1977) and L'argent (1983). The donkey finds grace by the end of Au hasard Balthazar as does the girl Mouchette in the following film. With his color films `grace' becomes much more elusive with Bresson apparently giving up on his fellow man altogether.

This theme of grace refers us to the Catholic predestinarian Jansenism that informs every single Bresson film. Time and again protagonists simply function in any given narrative to fulfill whatever has been predestined for them to fulfill. They have no free will of their own and are 'acted on' from on high. Usually the film charts a journey which becomes a metaphorical search for spiritual grace, for salvation. Conventional character psychology has no place in a Bresson work - it doesn't matter what happens between birth and death, the result will be the same - such is the nature of predestination. We are taken on a journey together with any given protagonist and are made to feel as they do as they approach salvation. In the case of our donkey, his journey through life via use and abuse is his fate and through his death in a beautiful meadow surrounded by sheep he finds his salvation away from his tormentors. The fact that he is a knowingly innocent victim of life's circumstances makes for a truly heart-breaking conclusion to the film.

Of course the donkey is a lot more than just a donkey. He is named `Balthazar', the name of one of the three Magi who visited baby Jesus in Bethlehem. One obvious reading of the film is to treat it as a Passion play with Balthazar taking on the attributes of Jesus Christ. He is born in a stable, is owned by 7 people which represent the 7 Stations of the Cross which he has to negotiate en-route to his Calvary. Golgotha is the final meadow where he dies for all of man's sins - his crucifixion made real amidst his followers (the sheep). On the journey, various aspects of religious practice are obliquely referred to and part of the fun is to spot them as they fly past in this short and rigorously intellectual film. Balthazar's most loving owner is named Marie (played by Wiazemsky), obviously referring to Jesus's mother and also to Mary Magdelene the whore. Marie's suffering mirrors that of Balthazar throughout the film especially when she takes on aspects of whoredom in a dance and when she sells herself to the grain merchant (Pierre Klossowski). Balthazar is baptized by kids at one point, the bells around his neck symbolizing church bells. Then he is draped with flowers and decorations as if preparing for Palm Sunday's grand entrance to Jerusalem. We see transubstantiation invoking the Eucharist when the evil village boy Grard (Franois Lafarge) delivers bread and the drunken Arnold (Jean-Claude Guilbert) knocks back his red wine. Noah's Ark is recreated at the circus in an impressive montage bestiary sequence which Bresson gives us showing us the various caged animals who are all as doomed as Balthazar to the life of servitude.

As well as the 7 Stations of the Cross we have the 7 deadly sins - lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride which should be (but mostly aren't) balanced with the 7 Catholic virtues - chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness and humility. This dichotomy is reflected within the 7 owners who show all these qualities to varying degrees. If this was simple religious allegory each owner would represent one sin, but Bresson knows real life is more complicated than that - all sins and virtues exist together and feed off each other. Therefore each of the seven owners pointedly exhibit them all as one. There are several scenes where characters display opposite emotions in short succession - Arnold swears he will never drink again but then in the very next shot he is knocking back a bottle of wine. Grard takes on the role of Satan in the film. He is the cause of much of the crime and discontent in the village. He pours oil on a road to cause a car crash only in the very next scene to take up his place in the organ loft of the church to sing like an angel with the choir. Watch carefully and we realize that what Bresson gives us in this film is the whole world in microcosm where the basic metaphysics of our existence on this planet are laid out for us to unravel. Jean-Luc Godard said it best when he said Au Hasard Balthazar is ""the world in an hour and a half"". It is an extraordinarily deep metaphysical journey, but is never pretentious in any way.

At various points I was reminded not only of Dostoyevsky's The Idiot (the donkey and Prince Myshkin share Christ-like similarities), but also of the acidic religious films of Luis Buuel. The drunk Arnold belongs to the world of Viridiana's derelicts and his death (one look up, one look down, then falling off Balthazar to crack open his head) is classic Buuelian sardonic humour. Then the grain merchant appears to have stepped straight out of Nazarn (1958) and in his scene with Marie the old man lays out the mantra of the perfect life as being one of self-help, greed and gluttony. The man makes advances on the poor girl who just wants shelter (she repeatedly removes his hand from her shoulder) leading eventually to her rejecting the money after his lecture on human dissolution is paraded as a positive. Note she gives herself to him in the end, probably taking the money as well. The casting of writer Pierre Klossowski here was significant - he was a famous expert on the Marquis de Sade and is one of the names listed in the glossary opening Pier Paolo Pasolini's monument to the excesses of Fascism, Sal, or 120 Days in Sodom (1975). In 1964 Klossowski had been responsible for the French publication of Sade's book and no doubt Bresson had in mind the depravity in mind and spirit of Sade when he asked the writer to play for him. Significantly, Buuel also borrows from Sade in Nazarn. Equating the values of provincial country life in France with those of the Marquis de Sade was hugely controversial, but Bresson obviously thought he had a point.

I could go through the film shot-by-shot or character-by-character bringing out all the subtle themes and references, but that would spoil it for you. Acquainting yourself with Bresson's masterpiece is something the viewer must do on his own. As with the very greatest art, the more effort one puts in, the more one gets out in the end. Au Hasard Balthazar is one of those films that you could spend a lifetime getting to know, reliving the experience as one relives the Passions from the Bible. Once you penetrate beneath the surface simplicity I would say this film is far from an easy experience, but it is certainly a deeply rewarding one.

The only negative thing I have to say concerns the lack of extras on this Artificial Eye DVD. A scholarly commentary and a perceptive documentary are surely necessary for the presentation of such a marvelous film. The film positively cries out for help for it to be more readily understood, especially in today's world where few have little time for the austerity of the likes of Bresson. Even on a light gossipy level this film has interest and surely something could have been added to the disc. For example, one of the reasons Anne Wiazemsky's performance is so warm is that Bresson was in love with her during the shoot. His advances on her were rejected so she later said. Later of course Wiazemsky met and married Jean-Luc Godard, appearing in his Le Chinoise (1967) - something Bresson was reportedly angry about. Wiazemsky and Dominique Sanda (star of Une femme douce [1969]) were the only two Bresson `models' who went on to have successful acting careers. There are no complaints about the quality of the transfer. Visually it is excellent (aspect ratio 16:9 - 1.66:1) and the sound is ideally sharp as it needs to be to catch everything that goes on. Shame about the lack of extras, but this is a film which should be in every collection. Strongly recommended.",1411430400,5,11436,4.737449799196787

Robert Bressons main obsession was not to shoot theatre scenes. The element actor in his movies was turned into a kind of set piece. All sorts of emotion had to be suppressed, because being theatrical. But, his view was too rigid.

2179090,3,B00068OSVI,"AU HASARD BALTHAZAR, (1966).  This 95-minute black and white film from greatly respected director Robert Bresson is generally considered a classic of French cinema.  It is considered part of a trilogy with the director's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-Escaped/dp/B00C9VAL70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man Escaped</a>, which I loved and reviewed in these pages, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pickpocket-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000BB14IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pickpocket (The Criterion Collection)</a>. In fact, it is generally considered to be a religious fable, from the very Catholic French director, who also wrote it.  In it, he traces the lives of a farm girl, Marie, and her pet donkey, whom she names Balthazar. The two will eventually become separated, but their experiences seem to follow strangely parallel paths. As a young woman, Marie is cruelly abused by her lover, while Balthazar suffers at the hands of a number of indifferent, cruel owners. But their torments, according to the critics, ultimately become the vehicle for their spiritual transcendence and redemption.

A unique film, AU HASARD BALTHAZAR was awarded the Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. As was true of the honored, revered even, director's work at this point in his career, the film is an ingenious monument of minimalism.  The actors are nonprofessional, and it seemed, as often as not, were viewed only by their legs and feet.  The film is greatly restrained, tightly edited, with carefully composed monotone images, long silences, broken only by a simple piano sonata that underscores its mood.

The critics also generally agree that the purpose of a film is to establish a mood, to transmit emotion, to generate feelings.  Well, I found the life and death of Balthazar, from idyllic childhood surrounded by loving children, through adulthood as a downtrodden beast of burden, to be unbearably sad.  However, the film also made me angry.  We first see Marie as a child who dotes upon the young animal.  Then she gets boy-crazy, and, boy, she really knows how to pick her lovers. As she gets more involved in her troubled life - troubles brought upon her by herself--she ignores Balthazar, paying no attention to his well-being, leaving him outdoors in rain, cold and snow to the point where he gets sick, allowing him to be taken by a series of exploitive  new owners.  She walks right by the animal without even acknowledging his presence.  It seems to me the poor creature, living in a world he cannot control, would be heartbroken long before his death, which he well might have welcomed. Can't help thinking the poor creature would rather have been treated well than transfigured

Now, I admit it, like many an air-headed Hollywood starlet, I'm greatly concerned about animal welfare, and Bresson, and the critics, might never have expected this film to be viewed by a person with this strongly held viewpoint.  Whatever; masterpiece the movie may be, moving it certainly is, but I really was not able to enjoy it.",1380585600,4,3129,5.501043841336117

In fact the film made such a big impact that all three see it as marking a new direction for cinema. Duras sees it as the first film that is completely liberated from the other arts; both Godard and Malle admire the films interiority. Personally, I think Bresson is the one who really describes his use of cinema in the most compelling way.

As is well known, he often uses non-professional actors. And here in a wonderful DVD extra, he describes why. I'm paraphrasing here but essentailly Bresson is saying that the more self-conscious we are, the more controlled our self-presentations, and the less likely we are to reveal who we are to ourselves/others. Like Montaigne (who Bresson admired), Bresson claims that we reveal more of our essential selves in our seemingly random gestures than in our carefully chosen words. And Bresson suggests the camera picks up more of these autonomous, mechanical gestures than the naked eye. Bresson's is thus a cinema of gestures that reveal not the truths we as individuals want to show but the ones we don't want to show or the ones we are leastr aware of. I can think of no other encapsulation of Bresson's intentions as a filmmaker.",1342742400,2,1466,4.66023166023166

And according to all available evidence, Bresson pushed reality to its furthermost possible extreme by actually having all of these outrages visited on the living beast who was Balthasar in the film. The animal's suffering was authentic. Personally, I would question the compassionate spirituality of a director who expressed his artistic vision by repetitiously, almost compulsively torturing a helpless animal.",1318291200,17,813,5.253846153846154

I have enjoyed most of the Bresson creations I have seen, but this one was very hard work. The director defends his style and technical approach to film-making in an absorbing discussion involving some eminent devotees, as well as several of those involved in its making, emphasizing his quest for truth, realism and artistic integrity, but while his third objective is compellingly realized, the first two fall far short of achievement. Many ""truths"" are largely concealed, such as the nature of Gerard's relationship with the baker's wife, and how on earth Arnold the tramp could have come by his inheritance out of the blue. As the characters barely open their mouths to talk, we are expected to figure out the events and relationships from their facial expressions and the juxtaposition of photographic images, hardly a promising recipe for realism. Bresson is clearly applying the same minimalist principles to the cinema that Robbe-Grillet applied to Literature, Yves Klein to Painting, and Beckett to Drama. His influence can be seen in ""Last Year in Marienbad"" for which Robbe-Grillet wrote the scenario. I also noted a surprising link to Pasolini's ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"". If Balthazar is a metaphor for Christ, Pasolini has given us the real thing, and in an austere minimalistic style straight out of Bresson. Indeed, the spiritual qualities that I find missing in Bresson's film because they are simply not expressed, permeate the Pasolini work. It is ironic that an atheist could achieve this more so than a devout Catholic, predominantly because he is not afraid to incorporate emotion into his oeuvre. I could not comprehend why so many of the reviewers of Balthazar required handkerchief's at the end of the movie to wipe their streaming eyes. In his interview, Bresson proudly asserts that in his work he avoids trying to entertain his audiences. In this film he fulfills this objective superbly",1308960000,6,2099,4.982905982905983

2179119,5,B00068OSVI,"So here's possibly my favorite movie ever:  ""Au Hazard, Balthazar"" is a rare example of how cinema can rise to the profundity and formal complexity of a Beethoven string quartet.  It also brought me as close to a religious experience as I have ever experienced in a dark theater. Finally, it is surely the finest movie about a donkey ever made.
 Made in France in1966 by visionary director Robert Bresson, the protagonist is  Balthazar, a donkey who is born, lives, suffers and dies in a mean little rural village. He is passed from owner to owner: a loving family bound for dissolution and bankruptcy; a drunken tramp who beats him; a circus where he performs tricks; a lecherous mill owner who uses him as a beast of burden; a gang of delinquents who use him for smuggling contraband.  Whether ill-treated or well-treated, Balthazar mutely submits uncomplaining (except for the occasional emission of a magnificent bray). For that is all an animal can do.
 Balthazar's life parallels that of the daughter of his first owner, Marie, who garlands him with flowers and baptizes him when she is a little girl, but grows into adolescence making every wrong choice imaginable.  She spurns her childhood sweetheart, whose wealth could save her father's failing farm. Instead she falls in love with the vicious local hoodlum, with horrendous consequences. For unlike donkeys, humans exercise free will, but in Marie's case, this leads to degradation and despair.
 ""Balthazar"" is not really a movie about a donkey; it is about the people in whose midst he lives and dies, and the seven deadly sins that he will never taste. Director Bresson suppresses surface emotion by eliciting expressionless performances from his non-professional cast; he employs no soundtrack music except for an occasional snatch of a Schubert pinao sonata; he likes to shoot people at waist level passing in and out of doorways a whole lot, rather than letting them emote; he omits the dramatic moments that would be central to a normal movie.  Bresson's austere style allows the viewer to supply the missing emotion.  This witholding of conventional drama magically makes small moments pack the wallop of an explosion.
 French director Jean-Luc Godard called ""Balthazar"" ""the whole world in ninety minutes.""  Through the mute eyes of a donkey, the human condition is revealed. And to paraphrase another critic, Donald Richie, when you watch the final scene of this film, I defy you not to weep. And you won't be crying for Balthazar.  You will be crying for us.",1245196800,11,2530,4.995238095238095
2179120,5,B00068OSVI,"The greatness of Robert Bresson's 1966 black and white film, Au Hasard Balthazar (which, translated, means something like Randomly Balthazar or By Chance Balthazar), comes not from only one aspect of it, nor even just a few. Virtually every aspect of the film reeks and resonates greatness, although, despite this being the near full consensus opinion of film lovers and critics alike, it is one of the most poorly understood films I've ever read the criticism of. This is because so many aspects of the film are based upon its most superficial qualities, rather than those deeper and more essential, even as the film achieves this depth in only 95 minutes. This economy occurs because the film focuses not on the superfluities of living, but only those things with resonance and meaning, the important and poetic moments that distill all else. And, oftentimes, those things with meaning are not the expected architectures of the human face, but those of other parts of the human body, like hands, backs, and human postures; all of which evoke connections and depths that would likely be unthinkable to cogitate on in films by other directors.

  But before I get into this film's essence, let me synopsize the narrative. The film is a picaresque `animal film,' and I am an animal lover, so I am emotionally inclined to be favorable to any such film. Yet, when I write this fact of the film's nature, I do not mean it in the way a film like My Dog Skip (a great `animal' film aimed at children) is an `animal film.' Au Hasard Balthazar goes above and beyond even that high level of art, for many reasons; yet one of the most manifest is that it is shorn of all sentimentalism, even that sort which is meant in a positive sense. The film follows the life and death of a male donkey in the French countryside. Named and christened Balthazar by his first owner- a young girl named Marie, the donkey grows up, changes owners several times, and eventually ages, and bleeds nearly to death, seemingly dying on a hilltop, surrounded by a flock of sheep, after being accidentally shot at night, when he is stolen by the film's villain, to transport illegal good across the French border. But, before that denouement, we get to see many slices of life: that of the donkey, its owners, and the people that are around it in the small village; even those things that are beyond the purview of the beast's impassive eye....Au Hasard Balthazar is nothing short of a masterpiece; a work of art of the highest order; amongst the greatest dozen or two films ever made, and on par with the same highly ranked works of art by the greatest writers, poets, playwrights, musicians, and painters. It also points out convincingly why art is better than religion or philosophy in dealing with the `big questions' in life, for art has an economy neither of the other two pursuits possess- witness Balthazar's death. How many words would be spilt in a religious text or philosophic tract to distill what the mere sight of a dying donkey amidst sheep does? Art is models of the real that encode and decode the real while elevating the very process of that encoding and decoding. Art (and especially film and its even more abstract cousin, poetry) can penetrate far more deeply, and with far less distraction than any other human media, into the essentials of existence. Art can elucidate these matters with eloquence and profundity; and art, and only art, can do so in the hands of a great artist.

  I give you Robert Bresson.",1224288000,3,3499,4.709150326797386
2179121,5,B00068OSVI,"""Au Hasard Balthazar"" is a heartbreaking masterpiece by Robert Bresson.  The simplicity of his storytelling is deceptive; he can sum up the tragedy of the human condition so brilliantly through the story of a donkey and the people who surround it.  The ending is tragic, yet beautiful and redemptive.  I first saw this one cold winter's day as a university student in Boston, and I still haven't forgotten about how I felt after first watching it.

2179122,1,B00068OSVI,"It is beyond me that this movie is ranked so high but then again not many people have rated this movie.

This movie was made as if a group of aliens decided to make a film from their poorly developed concepts of human beings. Some of these misguided concepts included the notion that (spoilers) a young woman, Marie, could love her donkey and yet stand by and do nothing as she watched it get beaten after she had done it's hair. Oh wait, not nothing, she later becomes romantically involved with the donkey-beater, the very same one who beats the donkey repeatedly throughout the movie and lights it's tail on fire and gets it killed.

It's as if the aliens assumed that humans don't have any virtues such as loyalty or compassion or even intelligence. Or maybe they simply didn't realize that poorly developed characters with bad haircuts and mental problems, like Marie has, are not something people could get into easily.

Another misunderstanding the aliens have about humans is the concept that on a dance floor in a country bar in 1960s France, humans would be unfazed by bottles and mirrors being broken around them. These people just continue to dance as if nothing at all different is happening from what goes on in their village everyday. Also in this alien-directed bar scene we see Marie rejected by the antagonist and in complete acquiescence, she simply throws her arms around the boy standing right next to her and slow dances. What were those people drinking?

It's clear what the alien director's favorite acting technique is - no reaction. We saw this in the bar and we see it multiple times throughout the movie including when the lady prays to God that her husband not die and two seconds later he dies. She simply crosses his arms over his dead body and goes on her merry way. I think there was a scene in the beginning where Jacques' older sister dies and his father dutifully employed the no reaction technique.

The aliens must have done their research on how to incoherently shift from scene to scene from the David Lynch Guide to Making Movies except without the brilliant purposefulness behind it. This was just bad movie making

The aliens also included the treat of having the antagonist of the movie ask the recently widowed mother of the girl with the mental problems (who in fact was recently beaten and humiliated by this same antagonist) if he could borrow the donkey. The mother then uses the no reaction technique again.

Finally after everything but the kitchen sink is thrown at the donkey including a requisite humiliating circus scene, the aliens reward our sitting through 90 minutes of this travesty with the donkey being shot randomly and passing the night, unable to sufficiently lie down b/c of the burden on it's back, in what we can only assume is pain and suffering only for it to meet it's end in a field of sheep of which the aliens are mirroring back ourselves if we are indeed still sitting through this.

I hope the aliens explained to the actor donkey that the real fear and stress it was feeling from having a smoking tail and having fire crackers go off near it and a man chasing it with a chair is only ""pretend"". I am sure they got that point through to the donkey really well and it enjoyed an aperitif at the end of the day with the crew as they reviewed their performances.",1218240000,8,3335,4.621621621621622

through.  It's true that this movie is not conventionally entertaining,

pace, and depictions of cruelty would be challenging to many viewers.
Regardless, to me this is just about the deepest film I've ever seen,
because it contemplates the evil rottenness in this world, and finally
says, God loves the meek most of all.  The conclusion of ""Balthazar""
redeems the troubling sadness of the story with a gentle miracle, and
I've never seen a more moving ending to any film.

  Some reviewers have asserted that the abuse of the donkey was genuine.
I can think of safe ways of simulating all the ""abuse"" that would cause
zero suffering to the animal(s) playing Balthazar. Think cardboard cudgels
and balsa-wood chairs for striking, a fake donkey tail and dispersing a bag
of powder to look like smoke, or just clever editing for the firecrackers
scene.  Furthermore, why would a great director like Bresson alienate his
cast and crew with actual animal abuse?  And why would he risk running up
expense and causing production delays by tormenting his animal star, a naturally
contrary donkey, whom he was depending upon to get the film made?  Does it even
make sense that Bresson would make a film condemning animal abuse while doing
it himself?  I cringe at what is done to poor Balthazar, but it is not real.

It begins with Balthazar as a small donkey, being baptized and feeding from his mother.  He plays with the children and they consider him one of their own, they see him as an existing being, not an animal.  They, the children (save for one poor, sickly child) and Balthazar, are young and exuberant, no cares in the world; they're naive, they've no idea of the world of maturity and adulthood.

Then we simply enter a few years later, Balthazar is full grown and being used as a means of labor, because what else is an adult, be they human or animal, to do? and this continues throughout the film, with degrees of cruelty varying.

Marie's life is paralleled with that of Balthazar, met with cruelty by the scumbag Gerard, they both play the role of the pacifist, and in the end humanity takes advantage of their passivity by ultimately destroying them.  They try to resist, but it's met with failure, they're destined to be pawns, to be rags for others to wipe themselves with, tools to use and throw away.

The film was not on video at the time, so I desperately wanted to see it.  The film is so amazing, so poignant, and so deeply spiritual that no one could come away from it unmoved (unless they are completely heartless).  Instead of recapping the entire film, I'll just talk about the opening scene when Balthazaar is a child.  The 2 children who keep him as their pet baptize him.  I did the same to my 2 cats after seeing this film; that's how moved I was by it.  I remember telling friends about the ""plot"" of this, and, naturally, they laughed (haha, it's a film about a donkey.  Like Shrek, right?).  I ignored them, and saw one of the greatest films ever made.  Bresson is a master filmmaker, and this film is reminiscent of Tarkovsky and Dreyer, among others.  Bresson never belonged to any film movements (even though the French New Wave was happening around this time).  He is his own artist.  His films can be broken down into 2 categories:  masterpieces, and near masterpieces.  How many filmmakers can you really say that about?  Do yourself a favour and see arguably his greatest film...",1161993600,7,1240,4.593607305936073
2179150,4,B00068OSVI,"Most of the reviews so far fail to make these points: if you have not yet seen other films by Bresson (such as Diary of a Country Priest) or by certain other austere and difficult directors (Tarkovksy of The Mirror comes to mind), you will probably be wasting your money if you buy this one--rent it or get it from your library.

Second, it helps to know that Bresson thinks of actors as ""models"" and not as vehicles for plot and character development; they deliver their lines (what few they have!) in a largely emotionless way, the result, evidently, of repetition to the point where the lines are uttered almost unconsciously.

Third, Bresson views almost all of what most people call ""movies"" as merely filmed versions of the theater--in other words, the typical movie for Bresson is nothing more than a kind of play that happens to have been filmed. He believes that what he pointedly calls ""cinema"" must do something different in order to find its real potential as art: namely, the true art of film lies in the creation of meaning through the juxtaposition of images. (I don't think I know what he means, but that's what he says--all of this is in the excellent 1966 French television show that accompanies the DVD and that viewers MUST watch after the film itself.)

My own experience: I was both frustrated and fascinated by the film but was glued to it despite its lack of narrative arc or traditional emphasis on cause and effect. I do find Bresson's bleak take on human nature in this film too dark (and I am not particulary sunny myself on human nature) but am drawn to further consider Balthazar, and other Bresson films, in the future. In fact, I woke up the next day immediately thinking about Balthazar and am still thinking about the film two weeks later.

To rate such a film is, in a sense, both foolish and beside the point. It is not ""enjoyable"" in any normal sense and yet it is clearly a masterpiece in the way that many works of modern art are. You really have to be prepared to approach it as an aesthetic and intellectual challenge and to try to understand how meaning might emerge from the juxtaposition of filmed images. Oh, and did I mention that the donkey might be a Christ figure?",1160524800,7,2213,4.566750629722922
2179151,5,B00068OSVI,"'Balthazar' is a majestic film, the work which converted me to Bresson's uncompromising, graceful vision. Though dark, it hasn't the cynical pessimism of some of his later work. Only Tarakovsky, possibly Sukurov, have made work that makes us feel the ineffable, see the invisible, and touch the intangible. This and 'Diary of a Country priest' are my favourites. Balthazar, the donkey, is witness, judge and conscience to this remarkable parable of dienchantment with modernity. I wouldn't hazard an analysis. Suffice to allude to the superb final sequence of matyrdom as Balthazar, kneeling in prayer as if laden with perfumes, silk and gold, joins a flock of sheep on a hillside. As if seeking divine forgiveness for the entire human race, he appears to be tendering his own life in exchange. Bresson's filmic language is unique: elliptically concise, effect almost always preceding cause, creating uncertainty that our usual keys will open his doors of perception. But gently, not bafflingly so. A masterwork!",1158796800,3,1012,5.291925465838509
2179152,5,B00068OSVI,"I won't go into plot sypnosis, as it's been detailed in previous reviews of the film; instead, I'd like to address the message and meaning of the film.

In order to fully appreciate Au Hasard Balthazar one must understand the thematic construction of the film. By being literally a passive, dumb beast who is being passed from owner to owner and being mistreated and shown (little) love throughout his life, Bresson uses Balthazar as a witness and reflection -- or both a window and mirror, if you will -- of human nature in all its facets. There are also the clear parallels Bresson establishes between Balthazar and his owners, especially his first owner, Marie. The purpose of such a thematical tool is for the audience to regard Balthazar as another facet of the human condition, but only in the spiritual sense (Bresson takes extreme care in not anthromorphologize the donkey). So, with Balthazar and these group of characters, the film shows the entire spectrum of humanity: purity (Balthazar), good (Jacques), evil (Grard), weakness (Arnold), selfishness (Merchant), arrogance (Marie's father) and self-pity (Marie). In one or several of these characters, we can see ourselves since they encapsulate the different ways human beings deal with their existence.

Now this is the most important thing to comprehend about the film: Balthazar is an ignorant, unknowing beast who has no choice but to accept everything that happens to him in his life due to his condition, that of being a donkey, a creature who has no intelligence and who has no free will. He simply lives life the way he knows: he is used as an animal of burden, and he does so. He is mistreated by his owners, he accepts the mistreatment. He is shown love and compassion by Marie, he accepts it. He even shares his state of being with other animals (in times of captivity during his stay in the circus and times of freedom during in his deathbed). If you think about it, within the oportunities (or lack thereof) he has been given, and the circumstances (good and bad) he's gone through, Balthazar has achieved to live life to the fullest (and die with utmost grace). Us human beings have a different condition to Balthazar. Human beings have intelligence, reasoning and have the free will to make choices. Yet with all those gifts and advantages, humans have no peace of mind and keep having an attitude towards life and making choices that more often than not, lead to a life of misery and suffering, destroying ourselves and the lives of others in the process.

The simple yet profound question the film basically begs us to ask to ourselves is: ""if Balthazar could live life to the fullest, why can't we?"". When we realize this reflection on Balthazar's life and reflect it on our own, a sudden feeling of enlightenment, trascendence and spirituality undeniably invades us. Throughout this meaningful revelation, we emerge with a moral clarity (especially concerning the characters in the film) and with a newfound sense of spirituality, hope and a strong will to transform ourselves.

I personally can't think of something more inspiring and life-affirming than that. Au Hasard Balthazar very well might change your life. This is one of the most noble, humane and beautiful works of art, of any medium.",1156032000,10,3277,4.909747292418772
2179153,3,B00068OSVI,"Robert Bresson's ""Au hasard Balthazar"" should not (and I don't think anyone has) be viewed as a political movie. It's not a pro-animal rights movie, despite it basically being told from the point of view of a donkey.

 ""Au hasard Balthazar"" is one of the great religious movies of all-time. My own list would include Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""The Gospel According To St. Matthew"" and Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" but yet, Bresson doesn't throw the religious undertones in our face. In fact, if someone missed it, I wouldn't be surprised.

 We follow a donkey from birth until death. Along the way it is transfered from owner to owner, where it is met with a harsh life. Constantly beaten and abused what can the donkey do? It exist merely to serve no matter what. Some happiness is found along the way, when the donkey is with a young girl, Marie (Anne Wiazemsky) but these moments are brief.

 Bresson was a director who liked to strip his stories down to their most basic elements. He didn't use big names, didn't have big lavish sets, and perhaps along with Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, devoted his career to making films dealing with existential themes. Although you could argue Bresson had a more cheerful view. But all of his films tackle big subjects. His final film ""L' Argent"" is based on a Tolstoy story, ""Pickpocket"" is loosely based on Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"", and ""A Man Escaped"" must have been deeply personal for him, since he was a POW during WW2.

 And for a director who worked many times with non-actors, you couldn't get further away from an actor than working with a donkey. Now I know, a movie about a donkey may not seem like a movie that can involve a large audience. But Bresson does just that. The donkey, it should be noted, never becomes animated. It is a character in the story, but never takes on human dimensions. It doesn't speak, tell jokes (do you know what the one donkey told the other donkey when they broke up? Your a jacka@@!), sing or dance. Yet there is compassion to be felt for the animal.

 For those who have yet to see this film I think you may be surprised at just how involving the movie can be. And if you've never seen a Robert Bresson film, this will be a treat.

 The movie's score consist of Schubert's Piano Sonata No. 20 and was filmmed by Ghislain Cloquet. Perhaps best known for his work on Woody Allen's ""Love and Death"", Jacques Demy's ""Donkey Skin"" and ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" and Alain Resnais's masterpiece ""Night and Fog"". *** 1\2 out of *****

 Bottom-line: ""Au hasard Balthazar"" is one of the Robert Bresson's most touching films. A film with strong religious undertones that aren't forced upon the viewer.",1146528000,20,2707,4.635983263598327
2179154,5,B00068OSVI,"Make no mistake, this film is (seemingly) long and (achingly) slow (in the positive sense of the terms): it would be deadly on a caffeine high or during a restless mood. If you can stand something that's virtually plotless but nonethless ""transcendent"" as a piece of art, then I heartily recommend this film. Otherwise beware, as evidenced by the rather negative opinions of other reviewers, but to them I ask: What on earth else were you expecting from a Bresson, a marginal and explicitly Catholic filmmaker?",1142899200,12,510,4.941860465116279
2179175,5,B00068OSVI,"There is something foreign, almost inhuman about this bresson film - the nearly complete lack of emotion exhibited by the characters, their hands and feet moving like autotrons. Bresson's communities are flat, colorless, barren and humorless. Still, the power this film has to generate such raw passion and deep sorrow is a mystery. You realize that you've been changed by the artistry of a master, but are at a loss to explain why or how. This film about the life and death of a donkey named Balthazar resonates deeply, and while it may very well be a Christian allegory it need not be - it does not approach you from the intellect. It may very well be a film about mans cruelty to those helpless creatures that have no free will, but then again it need not be. It is not a film that directly pulls on your heartstrings. ""Au Hasard Balthazar"" is a film that uses characters as both windows and mirrors. Through them we bear witness to man's cruelty, pride, indulgences - weaknesses. Through them our own emotions are pulled from the depths of our subconscious and then projected back at us with the force of moral clarity. Somehow we are cleansed and by watching this all too familiar human landscape of the lost, we somehow find ourselves. And so when the almost unbearable, yet strangely beautiful final scene plays out and the other worldly notes from a Schubert Sonata rain down upon us, through the suffering of this poor beast Balthazar, we are baptized.",1139356800,17,1461,4.688715953307393

2179178,5,B00068OSVI,"How Bresson manages to make a feature-length film in which the central figure is a donkey without ever being cute or anthropomorphic or boring is a mystery in itself.  How he manages to make it resonant with irony, tragedy and philosophical depth is an even greater mystery.  Viewers will also be struck by how utterly different it is from Bresson's other films--as each of them are, indeed, utterly different from each other.  Superficially, it seems to have nothing in common with ""Diary of a Country Priest"" or ""Les Dames du Bois du Boulogne"" or ""A Man Escaped"", and yet it constitutes, like them, a world of its own.

2179179,3,B00068OSVI,"Au Hasard Balthazar is a somber tale characterizing the cruelty of the human race from a donkey's viewpoint. It's an interesting premise that ultimately doesn't work with Bresson's minimalist style. The film is somewhat effective, especially the scenes showing the donkey's love and mistreatment by humans. However, because Bresson's direction doesn't allow for ""acting"" in the typical sense, the only character that comes accross as real is the donkey. The non-professional actors are nicely cast, but they are never allowed to express themselves clearly, and the film becomes an examination of boredom and sadness. Bresson's attempt at bringing religous undertones and symbolism to a donkey's life is a truly original idea, but his directing style causes this intersting tale to become an act of tediousness that never allows the viewer to feel for the donkey, or the human race who persecutes it.",1128902400,7,899,5.338028169014085

The story is amazing not to mention the cinematography and the directing. The film follows the life of Balthazar, a donkey through the trials and tribulations of life that have him under the care of the loving Marie to the cruel Gerard and abusive old man. All in all it is easy to see that Bresson is comparing the donkey's life to humans as the donkey represents humans who all are born, live, work, suffer and ultimately share the same fate. This is a excellent movie and anybody that loves films should watch it. To be honest I completely fell for the this movie and anybody could easily sympathize with Balthazar the donkey. Highly recommended.",1125446400,9,815,4.476510067114094
2179181,5,B00068OSVI,"A truly unique work in cinema.  It is simply amazing that a story that is, on the surface, mostly about the life of a donkey can cause you to ponder the mysteries and ironies of life and fate.  Bresson created here a model of how to say more with less.  The final scene of this film is illustrative of this in its extraordinary  ability to deeply move the viewer with only a bare minimum of directorial touch.

The plot lines of Au Hasard Balthazar at times seem forced, sometimes confusing the viewer, and often leaving the characters' motivations unexplained.  This matters little, however, because they all follow the same theme that one's actions, explainable or not, are often just a reaction to the environment within which we are placed.  The human characters and the donkey are one.  Just as Balthazar must succumb to the whims of his owners, so are we humans often just surviving, and submitting to, the actions of those who control us.  The film is in many ways a rumination about the free will actually afforded us in life.  A key scene is between Marie and the miserly farmer (winemaker?), where the latter expounds upon his philosophy.  Money and self-confidence are the keys for him because they allow a certain autonomy that lets him do as he pleases.  Money, or the lack thereof, is depicted in several instances as often replacing true morality or spirituality in the characters' lives.

Another scene that mesmerizes (there are several) is when Balthazar is pulling the circus-animal feeding cart through the cage area.  The soundless shots of the donkey making eye contact with the other animals is brilliantly done (again with little camera flourish).  They seem to be communicating silently with only their gazes, which say ""here we are, this is our fate"".  Extremely affecting, and staggering in its simplicity.

This is a film to be watched again and then again, and then again.  In one of the DVD extra features, film scholar Donald Ritchie states that he has seen Balthazar many times, yet he still cries during the ending.  I believe this and understand it.  Credos to Criterion for resurrecting this classic, and for again doing such a fine production job.",1124668800,15,2183,4.83288409703504
2179182,5,B00068OSVI,"The title translates as ""Balthazar by Chance"", which seems apt as chance pervades the storyline and forces us to think about morality and sin in unconventional ways. To say this 1966 film is challenging to watch is to pay its director Robert Bresson the ultimate compliment, as he dares to make us care about a donkey named Balthazar, whose unexceptional existence reflects the unexceptional people around him. Thankfully there is no attempt to personalize the animal because he really becomes the cathartic vehicle by which its various owners express their emotions, whether it's the adoration of a little girl or the abuse of a baker's rebellious son.

It makes for an oddly fulfilling dynamic because throughout the movie, I find myself seeking out the slightest reaction from Balthazar to the world around him. It helps that Bresson's filmmaking style is similar to Yasujiro Ozu's - long shots, steady camera positions, narrative ellipses which move the story along by insinuation rather than dramatic episodes. However, there is something idiosyncratic to Bresson's storytelling style, for example, the use of pride as a destructive factor and a willingness to debase oneself as a means of self-protection. To me, that's what makes this particular movie resonate.

Balthazar is tied inextricably to a sad young girl named Marie, and their relationship is nothing remotely like ""National Velvet"" or ""My Friend Flicka"". One moment, she is adorning Balthazar with flowers, but in the next scene, she vacantly lets two young hooligans beat him mercilessly. As portrayed in a subtle manner by Anne Wiazemsky, Marie is an emotionally empty person, but somehow Bresson makes us empathize with her plight and her inability to distinguish between what will hurt her and what will benefit her. One gets the impression that Marie sees Balthazar as an object to be enjoyed, not a being with whom she should empathize. Marie clings to weakness and fear because that's all she knows, just as the callous Grard (played with nonchalant malice by Franois Lefarge) is sadistic not for cheap thrills - including cruelly setting fire to Balthazar's tail - but because he knows no other way to be.

Eventually, an ailing Balthazar is turned over to Grard's accomplice, a career criminal suspected of murder, and begins a new life as a guide animal, then as a circus attraction (in a funny, surreal scene where he solves multiplication problems), before being sold at auction to a miserly, abusive merchant, who in turn abuses Marie. The final scene attains a beatific quality with Balthazar old and near death, wandering into a herd of sheep--as, indeed, it began its life in such a herd. The other animals come and go, sometimes nuzzling up against it and taking little notice of their fellow animal. The circular nature of the story seems to show how we all seem to have certain destinies doomed to repeat the same mistakes when life offers no other options.

What comes across most powerfully in the movie is a sense of internalized emotional struggle. Balthazar may be the subject by default, but most of the movie deals with the people who own him, who employ and mistreat him, who are present when he is moved from one station of life to another.  Balthazar is not even used as a Greek chorus, as a lesser movie might. The Criterion Collection DVD offers a pristine print that optimizes the striking black-and-white camerawork by Ghislain Cloquet. I also like how Bresson uses music sparingly with brief Schubert piano sonatas that convey the movie's purity and austerity sometimes interrupted by the donkey's braying.

There are two valuable extras with the DVD - a recent fifteen-minute commentary by film scholar Donald Richie (he provides expert commentary on Criterion's Ozu DVDs as well) and in particular, an hour-long French TV documentary from 1966, ""Un metteur en ordre: Robert Bresson"", about the film featuring Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Louis Malle, and cast and crew members.
