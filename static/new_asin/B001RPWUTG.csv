3777578,5,B001RPWUTG,"Hi,
I have a question not a comment, one thing I hate is that I can not tell the titles of the films in the collection. I love Poirot, and have many of the volumes, I am just missing eight, I ordered some collection also, but I am so afraid of ordering movies that I already have. So if someone who already owns this collection count put the titles of the movies in the classic collection, I would really appreciate it.
Thanks",1274140800,9,426,4.2073170731707314
3777579,5,B001RPWUTG,"If a person likes high class and very well written mysteries, like Agatha Christie's books coming alive, then this is one series a person should invest in.  David Suchet does a wonderful and sometimes very funny Poirot, who is always in control and consumate detective.  The stories are intelligent, riveting, and interesting.  I highly recommend anything Agatha Christie starring David Suchet.",1265155200,4,394,5.426229508196721

3777585,5,B001RPWUTG,I am a HUGE fan of Agatha Christie and an avid reader of all her books. I recently started collecting DVDs based on her books and I think David Suchet is an awesome actor and the quintessential Poirot. This DVD is a great addition to my growing collection and a must have!,1345420800,,272,4.25

3777587,5,B001RPWUTG,Great viewing mysteries with Poirot that will keep you viewing and reviewing for hours.  The complete collection of this series is great and has great viewing mysteries.,1320278400,2,169,5.2592592592592595
3777588,5,B001RPWUTG,"Of course, we are great ""Poirot"" fans and who wouldn't be! David Suchet's performance of HP is such fun. This particular DVD has my personal favorite with the ""Chocolate Box"" amd the ""Yellow Iris"".  Enjoy!!",1319328000,2,206,4.885714285714286
3777589,5,B001RPWUTG,"Terrific quality.  I'm a Poirot fan, and this set is providing me many hours of enjoyment.  In addition, it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Thank you!",1315440000,,161,4.888888888888889
3777590,5,B001RPWUTG,"Poirot fans, who wish to have a complete collection, will find navigating through all the sets offered somewhat of a maze, specifically due to the lack of episode/movie titles, on the box front or in the seller's description. Some diligent viewers have been kind enough to provide titles, in their reviews.  However, I found it particularly difficult, when shopping, to figure out the contents of The Classic Collection Set 3, which is in a silver box.
Here are the titles:
1. The Adventure of The Egyptian Tomb
2. The Underdog
3. Yellow Iris
4. The Case of The Missing Will
5. The Adventure of The Italian Nobleman
6. The Chocolate Box
7. Dead Man's Mirror
8. Jewel Robbery At The Grand Metropolitan
9. The Case Of The Clapham Cook
Purchasing The Classic Collection Set 1(orange box), Set 2(yellow box), Set 3(silver Box - this set), and Set 4(platinum/pale pink box), individually is the best bargain.  The Classic Collection Sets 1, 2, 3, and 4, completely cover all of the Agatha Christie's Poirot: Collector Sets 1 through 12, a total of 36 episodes, which are the boxes with different colored bands, on the left side. Each of the Classic Collections has 9, of those Collector Set episodes.
For example, this Classic Collection 3, covers the Collector Sets 7, 8, and 9. Later The Classic Collection, Vol. 2 was produced, which covers nine movie length features, originally produced by Grenada Films and are different movies, from the 36 episodes, offered in the four Classic Collections. See the very professional review, on The Classic Collection, Vol. 2, by Themis Athena. It is confusing, because the titles, of each collection, have only subtle differences. Now the more recent films, which are new stories, are being marketed under Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Movie Collection Set 1, Set 2, Set 3, Set 4, Set 5, and Set 6.  Each of those sets has a different colored band across the top, of the box. The first three, of The Movie Collection Sets, is offered in Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection, which is the most economical purchase. The Movie Collection Sets 4, 5, and 6, are only offered individually.
Hopeully, the above information will help you, with your Poirot movie selections.",1310342400,10,2216,4.919786096256685

3777593,5,B001RPWUTG,"I own all but 2 of the Poirot series with David Suchet as Poirot. I will eventually purchase the whole series, and will be sad when I have come to the end. David Suchet has portrayed Poirot excellently. I do not compare the movies to the Agatha Christies books. I have not read the books but will someday. I enjoy setting down at days end, plugging in a DVD of Poroit and engulfing myself in a life style of England and the world of years ago. It is hours of entertainment that I can watch over and over.
Thank you",1294012800,,514,4.15
3777594,5,B001RPWUTG,"David Suchet never disappoints, and Hugh Frasier and Philip Jackson are excellent as Hastings and Inspector Japp, respectively.  The episodes are about an hour long and are adapted from Agatha Christie's short stories, I assume. They are great! Anyone enjoying British period mysteries will be happy with this set of Hercule Poirot stories.",1282608000,12,340,5.415094339622642

8338467,5,B001RPWUTG,"Agatha Christie's Poirot is a wonderful series. The expenses must have been great. Everything that you can imagine are period correct. This series keeps you guessing right up until the end who is the murderer.  I suggest buying all the CD's only if you like the first. I say this because if you like what you see in series one, you will love what you see it the rest of this wonderful production.",1358121600,,396,4.424657534246576
