8113526,2,B000ERHFYS,"Based on the other reviews, I had been looking very forward to this instructional DVD on finger cymbals (especially after being heavily disappointed by the poor instruction on Dolphina's finger cymbal dvd). The basic instruction that was given on Ansuya's dvd was in regard to direction of a leading hand instead of basing the finger cymbals on the beats of the actual music & music style ('right-left-right' instead of '1-2-3' etc).
  Some people may prefer this type of directional style. However, as an experienced musician, I much prefer to use the musicians style, especially since I'm left handed predominantly. I much prefer to alternate hands which is a much better way of expression instead of always appearing to lean to one side (I hope this was noted on the advanced cymbal dvd with Ansuya).
  A great dvd for teaching the alternating hands style is ""Bellydance with Zils"" with Elsa Leandros. She seems to have a little more experience with different musical styles and my daughter (who is also a musician and bellydancer) picked up good notes from Elsa immediately.
  I will give the dvd 2 stars for good effort.",1223596800,4,1125,4.925925925925926
8113527,5,B000ERHFYS,"I have a musical background (been studying classical piano since I was 5) so believe me when I say that Ansuya does a great job teaching you how to play finger cymbals/zills. She goes through 4 zill patterns and each pattern has a move that goes with them. It was fun, challenging and I can't wait to buy her advanced finger cymbals DVD which is coming out soon. If you are in the market for a zill DVD this is the one. I have tried the others and they don't come close!",1221091200,,470,4.119565217391305
8113528,5,B000ERHFYS,"Much of the instruction here is niceley detailed however, this video is expensive and you can get a great comprehensive beginner introdution with Dolphina's video instruction. Should you decide that zilling is for you, it is worth the investment.",1194048000,2,246,5.333333333333333
8113529,4,B000ERHFYS,"Ilove Ansuya.  She is awesome with the Zils.  I think if you are a beginner-beginner, this video is a little challenging.  That said, with practice and lots of it, this dvd would come in handy.  I like the way she shows the hands and incorporates into the moves.  It's just hard at first.  I would recommend this dvd if you really want to put the time and effort into learning the zils, for sure.",1190160000,7,396,4.283783783783784
8113530,5,B000ERHFYS,"Ansuya's instruction is careful and there is plenty of time for revision.  In this DVD, she gives a great instruction for anyone who wants to learn the zills.  Well worth the price.  With Ansuya you get what you pay for. Thankyou.",1182816000,6,230,4.560975609756097
8113531,5,B000ERHFYS,"This is a rather expensive DVD but is worth every cent!

In two weeks (yes, after a lot of practice) I was able to dance and play zills without losing the tempo.

Ansuya breaks each rythm down into sections and slowly introduces movements to accompany each of them. There is also a performance at the end of the dvd which is just amazing.

You will not regret purchasing this DVD",1148342400,21,379,4.385714285714286
