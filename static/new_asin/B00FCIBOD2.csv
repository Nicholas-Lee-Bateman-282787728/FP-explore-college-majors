8614463,3,B00FCIBOD2,"Klaus is obviously one of those naturally talented people-who has worked hard on his personal connection to horses and the universe...the photography was beautiful-though often very dreamy and artistic-so if you are looking for an instructive journey-these are hard to follow. I feel a lot is lost in translation-and Klaus does not necessarily speak when he is working with an animal to let you know what he is doing. I got the sense that all the horses-though some obviously troubled-had at least had contact with humans from birth-their feet were trimmed and often they were well groomed-all in good physical shape for the most part. What was being dealt with then, was re-arranging trauma, or green-ness, or detachment issues.

I caught glimpses of technique-but it was difficult to find with the photographic focus on a variety of aspects-mostly artistic in nature.  In short-this series gave one the glimpse of ""the possible"" if you are young, athletic, long legged, focused and in the better looking categories of human conformation:)...but doesn't hold much hope on the instruction level for those of us who are involved with horses at a higher, less agile age level! ;)

It is interesting to compare the facilities and landscape, and probably genetic backgrounds of the featured horses to those in the U.S.  The work often took place in nothing more than a single rope enclosure.",1420934400,,1387,5.0701754385964914
