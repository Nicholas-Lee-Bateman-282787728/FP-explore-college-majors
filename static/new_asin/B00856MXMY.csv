8525260,4,B00856MXMY,"Entertaining low budget horror. Stars Veronica Ricci as Bloody Mary.  Strong native 3D adds to production value. This German import is edited for violence.  Region B coded but plays fine without any problem in my US Region 1 Blu-ray 3D player.  English language. With lower expectations, you may enjoy this disc and care to add this to your collection.  The price is right.  Hopefully a US unedited 3D version will be in the future. Received fast shipping from Germany from M+L.",1449964800,,478,4.851851851851852
8525261,3,B00856MXMY,The 3d is native or real here.  And that's the best part of this VERY low budget film.  The cast does what they can on their small budget and it's sort of like a cheap penthouse movie.  I got this for the 3d which I collect and of course we do get a very hot lead actress and that helps.  But without the 3d this would be one that many people might dismiss due to it's budget.  3d fans should grab this one for it's native 3d which is excellent though!,1432598400,,452,3.923076923076923
