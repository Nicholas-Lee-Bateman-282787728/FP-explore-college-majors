8495247,5,B0069AM0ZS,This is almost as good as actually riding these coasters themselves.  The footage is great!  It does not have any of that usual shakiness that you see other other coaster videos.,1354233600,,178,4.709677419354839
8495248,5,B0069AM0ZS,"The quality on these videos is amazing!  You cannot find as high a quality video anywhere!  The filming is incredible, and the 'steadiness' is amazing!  Even if you own the DVD versions of some of these coaster, you MUST get this version.  Watching the 1080p versions of the coasters on a big screen TV is beyond amazing.  It's as if your looking through a window!  Great stuff, can't wait for more releases!",1342828800,2,408,4.597222222222222
8495249,5,B0069AM0ZS,You will *NOT* find anything like this online.. this footage knocks your socks off and looks AMAZING on your HD TV!  This has got a great selection of coasters and is such a value for the amount of footage that you get.  Theme Park Review really has knocked it out of the park with this one!,1341878400,,291,4.178571428571429
