701728,3,630367545X,"Don't be scared off by some of the negative reviews claiming that the aerobics portion is too difficult.  Low impact instruction is on the right, high energy on the left, and the warm up begins with a pregnant woman.  It features country, broadway, and ""traditional"" aerobics dance segments, and while some of the moves are challenging, it's a nice departure from the traditional (and monotonous) grapevine - knee lift - kick moves some instructors offer.  For the intermediate and advanced, there is a lot of room to make this workout more intense.  I would have given this workout a higher rating, but part of my criteria in judging an aerobics routine is: Would I be embarrassed if someone saw me doing this?  And because of the country dance segment, I have to say yes.
I didn't include the stretch segment in my rating as I found it disappointing and not too different from what I normally do. . . perhaps it was a bit slower.  If  you're not used to regular stretching, you may find it helpful.",974073600,4,1000,4.6158192090395485
701729,3,630367545X,"If you don't pick up routines easily, this one will probably frustrate  you. I happen to like the aerobics routine very much, but I used to be a  professional (singer/dancer/actress). For me, it is fun! If dancing comes  easily to you and you need a good beginner video, this is a good short  routine (only 13 minutes aerobic). It could also be used as a warm up for a  toning workout by more advanced beginners and intermediates (since there  are both low and mixed impact versions of the routine demonstrated). The  stretch routine is not my favorite. I think Jane did much better in other  videos.",965260800,6,600,4.59433962264151
701730,4,630367545X,"I have really had a great time with this video. I was concerned about it based on reviews I read, but I was wonderfully suprised. I found the aerobics section motivational and high energy. The streach section was  simple in nature, but it really allowed me to  push myself in the streaches  to achieve maxium flexability. I have many of Jane's videos and this one is  another favorite!",964483200,,385,4.617647058823529
701731,3,630367545X,"I found this video to be well choreographed and the low impact aerobics both fun and challenging.  However, the stretching portion of the routine (which Jane leads) was very mediocre.  Even  inflexible friends of mine  found this less than challenging and Jane doesn't give you enough time to  get something out of stretches that do seem to be working.",954720000,3,352,4.898305084745763
701732,1,630367545X,"I would never recommend this tape to anyone.  It is nothing more than a very subtle and complicated dance routine with absolutely no instruction.  It's impossible to follow.  I've loved Jane Fonda's workout tapes for  years, but this one is very disappointing.",947116800,11,260,5.119047619047619
701733,5,630367545X,"I use this video in combination with the other two videos in the Personal Trainer series. This is an excellent workout for a beginner and it's short, so you don't get discouraged. The aerobic moves are easy to learn. The  stretch segment is also well done, although it some of the stretches should  probably be held longer.",942105600,11,323,4.649122807017544

7852718,5,630367545X,"Impressed with my shipment, product, and personal note. I have been looking for this product for a years. I was looking in the wrong places. A quick search on Amazon ended my search. I did not expect such a wonderful result from my purchase. Thank you, Thank you,Thank you.",1393286400,,273,4.591836734693878

7852720,1,630367545X,"There are 10,000 other fitness videos out there that would not profit a traitor to our country. What this rich woman did to our soldiers is unforgivable. Anyone who would let such a person profit by buying their goods is spitting in the face of our veterans.",1306281600,,258,4.51063829787234
7852721,5,630367545X,"I love this tape! It is the first tape I bought and out of the 30 I have the one I still do the most. Its short and very easy to learn. I lost 30lbs and 5 sizes working out with Jane. I like to use this tape to do after lifting weights or just do the stretch after doing the aerobics part. I recommend this tape for beginners or advanced. Just depends on what level you want to do. There is not any lunging,squats,jumping, or abs in this video. Just strictly moving your body to music and burning fat!",1076025600,5,501,4.02
7852722,4,630367545X,"I love the stretching part of this tape.  I do not like the aerobics very much because I have terrible coordination.  Overall, I think this is a great tape.

7852723,3,630367545X,"Holy Cow!  I felt like a cow trying to follow.  If you can do the aerobic section of this tape you are a better person than me.  Watched it several times, tried it a few and got so frustrated that I gave up.  On the other hand, or foot, the stretching is very good and probably worth the price of the tape.  I suggest you borrow a copy before you buy if possible.",1046908800,2,363,3.9178082191780823
