5696980,5,B00C888OFA,This dvd is like a walk down memory lane with Henry and about Henry and about this wonderful palace.  Makes me want to go and visit.  Maybe stay on the grounds if that is permitted.,1377734400,,181,4.142857142857143
5696981,3,B00C888OFA,You get a very different picture and understanding of Henry VIII when you view it through the architectural lens of life in his favorite party palace.,1377561600,,150,4.8076923076923075

5696983,5,B00C888OFA,This outstanding documentary was originally aired on PBS and is the first in a series of documentaries about famous and historic palaces throughout Great Britain. Hampton Court was the primary home of Henry VIII from the time he was a young King until his death. Historians in the documentary tell a fascinating history of Henry and his unfortunate wives for whom some were beheaded due to the King getting bored and wanting a new wife. Hampton Court was later an unhappy palace of King George III's parents and later George III was the last monarch to live in the palace. The palace is a national treasure and a beautiful one at that. No expense was spared in Henry VIII building it and it shows. This documentary is filmed wonderfully and truly highlights this interesting palace and the commentaries by historians of Henry VIII and Tudor England and British History make this even more interesting! Highly Recommended!!,1374192000,15,922,4.916666666666667
5696984,5,B00C888OFA,"I have actually been to Hampton Court.  I went on a day tour that took us there on the Thames.  It was a guided tour and it was great.  HOWEVER, I wish I had seen this first!  This excellent 60-minute history and ""tour"" of the castle and its grounds gave so much more history and secrets, if you will, than I learned actually being there. For me, the main draw of the place is the cache of Henry VIII and Cardinal Woolsey.  To walk on surfaces that they trod literally took my breath away.  Nevertheless, so many of the fascinating tidbits in this documentary were left out during my visit.

Whether you have been, plan to go (a MUST before your trip) or daydream about going to Hampton Court, this dvd will give you lots of information and glorious images.

What I wouldn't give to go back, look up and see the handcarved ""eavesdroppers"" in the rafters!  Maybe one day I will do just that.",1372723200,35,890,4.345454545454546

Probably would be boring if you are not a fan of henry viii but still educational. Love it!!",1414195200,,192,4.078947368421052

5697009,5,B00C888OFA,"Documentary goes through notable times and people of history that occurred in Hampton Court. I thought this was very nice visually and appealed to my sense of history appreciation. Camera crews weave around and into all sorts of nooks and crannies while others discuss what they may have been used for, or if an important event was suspected to have happened there. I may well never see this place, or a great many others, so I enjoyed the opportunity to peek inside using this short.",1407974400,,484,4.705882352941177

5697012,5,B00C888OFA,"Hampton Court Palace is a treasure of English history and this DVD calls upon architectural and social historians to divulge its secrets.  You will learn that the word ""eavesdrop"" was invented her and see the original eavesdroppers.  You'll see how Henry VIII tried to erase Anne Boleyn's presence here, but was unsuccessful as one clue was left.  Perhaps it was done on purpose by a workman?  Technology will show you how tapestries from the 1500's here really looked in their original hues.  You'll see one of the few remaining 16th century kitchens.  And you'll understand why the Georgian kings eventually abandoned Hampton Court.  The history of a building is a fascinating way to approach the history of its times through the lives of its occupants.  This film exceeded my expectations.  I was interested to read that some reviewers learned more from this film than from the tour at Hampton Court.",1392508800,3,903,4.966666666666667
5697013,5,B00C888OFA,"I have always wanted to see Hampton Court but haven't made it there yet so I am absolutely thrilled to have this lovely dvd!!!  It whets the appetite to see this lovely palace.  I like the series of dvds that are being done now.  I already have Secrets of Highclere Castle which is WONDERFUL, and I think Secrets of Chatsworth is next on my list...if you are an Anglophile or if you are fascinated by Henry VIII, this is a treat!!!",1391817600,,431,4.296296296296297
5697014,5,B00C888OFA,Hampton court is excellent.  You relive the history with such incredible photograhy of the interior in the manor.  The grounds are very large and beautifully manicured. To have the wonderful history and marvelous photography of Hampton court during the period of King Henry and those who followed is really great.,1389744000,4,313,5.24
5697025,5,B00C888OFA,"I love castles, large homes and houses in general.  As far as a home goes, this one is right up there with the best.  Its not exactly what you think of as a castle; but is beautifully elegant and has so much history.  Great watching.",1388361600,5,233,4.133333333333334

5697027,4,B00C888OFA,Tghe video was well done but seemed to like the depth which was expected from it.  It was quite informative but did not show enought to make to outstanding..,1387843200,4,157,4.413793103448276
5697028,1,B00C888OFA,"I expected, in ordering this video, to see a reasonable sampling of the various rooms in this massive palatial structure. Having seen it, I'd estimate that perhaps a dozen rooms are visited, and none of them are really explored. It's as if the filmmakers were told to stand behind the velvet ropes with the tourists. Some of the great halls are shown, but the camera seems to be locked down at one end of the room, with the lens repeatedly tilted upward and downward, or panned, to provide an overview of ceilings, walls and floors, mostly from a distance. There is no footage to indicate the complexity of interior architecture. And the same views of external facades are repeated again and again, as if the film producers were highly restricted, outdoors as well as indoors, as to where they could set up their cameras.

Henry's troubled relationships with his wives, all of whom occupied Hampton Court, is lightly touched upon. For an hour-long production, this one contains far too little of substance. The potentials for a fine documentary on this subject would seem very large indeed. But without filmmaker access to at least some of the intricacies of the grand structures, they are not realized. The viewer is left with the impression that the entire program could have been filmed by a tourist who had rented a good video camera.

For an extremely fine presentation on a related subject, buy the 2012 BBC production, ""The Queen's Palaces,"" in which the royal family gave filmmakers far greater access to several famous palaces. I've watched it multiple times, and I'll watch it again. It's utterly fascinating.",1383264000,16,1619,4.905109489051095
5697029,5,B00C888OFA,"Until I watched thi documentary, I never knew that after Henry VIII died, it was in the process of being remodeled by King William and Queen Mary.  These documentaries are very insightful.",1382313600,3,188,4.875
5697030,5,B00C888OFA,Well in a way they can.  I didn't realize that it's from two different periods as the part that's usually shown is the Tudor front.  I found the fact that it was going to pulled down by William III and Queen Mary for upgrading and that it consists of two different eras very interesting as well as the monarchs who inhabited it.,1381622400,4,328,4.274193548387097
5697031,4,B00C888OFA,Great quality!  I really enjoyed the tour of the Palace. Great explanation of the different part and the loss of the oldest portions. Would  recommend for anyone interested in English history.,1381276800,2,192,5.161290322580645
5697032,5,B00C888OFA,I hae been to Hampton court and this is a great rminder as to what is at the court and for those of you who haven't seen it a good look at one of the great palaces of England.,1380672000,,175,3.5128205128205128

8578599,5,B00C888OFA,"This show does let us see some of the amazing architecture and decorations of Hampton Court, but its main focus is on the people who lived and worked there. It is half Tudor (the part expanded by Henry VIII after 1529) and half Stuart. In 1689, William III and Mary II wanted to update Hampton Court to rival the French King's new court at Versailles. So they started tearing down the Tudor = old-fashioned parts bit by bit. Their innovations included decorations such as ceilings in the Italian style, all rosy half-naked people cavorting on clouds. Fortunately, they ran out of remodeling money, so we can still enjoy the Tudor half of this great palace.

And what a half that is! Pictures don't really do justice to the huge kitchens and the Chapel's amazing gold & blue ceiling. According to the show, it was even brighter and more dazzling 350 years ago.

The most interesting thing I learned about was about Henry VIII's accident in 1536. He was an able athlete and competitive. It was at Hampton Court, relaxing with his pregnant 2nd wife, Anne Boleyn, that he was knocked from his armored horse, which promptly rolled over him. Not only did this leave him with a leg wound that wouldn't heal, but his personality seemed to change. Before he had been a charming, generous goodfellow. After, well, after, he became the tyrant we now usually think of.

Commentators include Suzannah Lipscomb (author and historian), Dr. Tracy Borman (historian), Dr. Jonathan Foyle (historian of architecture), Dr. Lucy Worsley (chief curator, Historic Royal Palaces), Marc MeHonville (food historian), Roman Krznaric (cultural historian), Linda Collins (art historian), Sioban Clarke (Hampton Court guide and lecturer), Mark Griffin (historical consultant), Dave Packer (state apartment warder), Laura Purcell (author) and Annabel King (state apartment warder).

Many other things are covered, including supposed hauntings. If you're interested in the many ghosts said to inhabit Hampton Court, I direct you to the latest.  Check out the youtube video ""Hampton Court Ghost CCTV"". In 2003, an inside courtyard door flew open three days in a row. A ghost appeared to close it on the 2nd day (only).  So, what do you think?!

The show originally aired in 2013 and is 56 minutes in length. If you purchase it on disc, English subtitles are available. There are no bonus features on the disc. ""The Secrets of Hampton Court"" is just one in a series. Five of the series' episodes can be purchased in a 5-DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Iconic-British-Estates/dp/B00KX44RNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Iconic British Estates</a>.

I have read a bit of British history and I still learned some interesting stuff from this show. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.
