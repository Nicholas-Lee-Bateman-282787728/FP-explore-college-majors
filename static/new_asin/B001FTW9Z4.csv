3589263,1,B001FTW9Z4,"This is not a kettlebell workout. As much as the makers of the DVD might wish to state that Pavel ok's the exercises without use of a kettlebell, the fact of the matter is that the distribution of the weight is altogether different than it is with a dumbbell. This is NOT a kettlebell workout, there is no kettlebell used in this DVD workout at all. How misleading to put the word ""Kettlebell"" in the title of the DVD, not to mention the woman on the cover is holding a kettlebell. This is utterly disappointing, and in my opinion unethical. If you want a kettlebell workout, this is not for you. This should have been titled, ""Dumbbell fusion functional fitness"" or some such. The makers of this DVD should be ashamed of themselves & scrap the DVD release altogether, come up with a new title & a new cover photo. Then perhaps come out with a new KETTLEBELL workout that is ACTUALLY a KETTLEBELL workout.

**UPDATE NOV. 21/08** Clips are now available on some other sites & the form shown on this DVD is AWEFUL ! It's not remotely like a kettlebell workout. For instance her joints are soft & she's using her arms to LIFT the weight while she's doing regular squats when mimicking a snatch, rather than thrusting & locking, not to mention there is virtually no propulsion shown in her movements on various exercises. That's the difference with kettlebell training & regular dumbbell strength training or even functional fitness training. The latter is done the way she demonstrates the movements in the DVD (although even with that said her form isn't that great), but what she is demonstrating, using soft joints & controlled LIFTING with the ARMS, & calling it kettlebell style exercises just ARE NOT REMOTELY the way they are done in kettlebell training. In kettlebell training there is propulsion, swinging, locking of the joints in a controlled manner, etc... Kettlebell exercises are VASTLY different from the way you would do a traditional weight training workout. As shown in this DVD all you're getting is a functional fitness dumbbell workout that is nothing remotely like a kettlebell workout. For instance in exercises where the lower body should propel the weight up, she softens her legs to stop the movement of the weight & then uses her arms to lift the weight. That's fine if you are doing a regular old strength training workout with weights, but that's not the way it's done with a kettlebell. It's bad enough a kettlebell isn't even used in this workout, but the workout is NOT a kettlebell style workout. The only thing kettlebell about it is the word 'kettlebell' in the title & that's it. For God's sake, she doesn't even get the name of some of the exercises correct. She calles the Turkish Get-Up a Turkish roll up, but it's not even done the way she shows it on the DVD anyway !!! As per the early negative reviews, people knew way ahead of time due to leaking of the info by Michele Olson herself (the so called trainer on this DVD) via e-mails between herself & fitness video enthusiasts & what she herself shared on fitness forums in which when she was questioned even more she, probably thinking it was good that she was getting all this attention, told them exactly the things shared in reviews here. Now that clips are available it is glaringly obvious that it is even worse than previous reviewers had stated. There are people on fitness forums who are now cancelling their pre-orders after viewing the clips. It's pretty bad, folks. Save your money.",1223856000,27,3484,4.702127659574468

As per an online post from Michele Olson, the instructor, she ""...leads the workout with a dumbbell and gives precise verbal cues if you already own and desire to use your kettlebell."" Why would they call this a kettlebell workout and have the instructor pictured with a kettlebell on the cover when she's admitted she doesn't even use one in it??

If you're looking to do ""kettlebell-style"" moves with a dumbbell, then purchase this dvd but if you're looking for a traditional kettlebell workout, don't waste your money on it.",1223856000,29,650,4.846846846846847

Another thing I really like is that kettle bell workouts don't have much in the way of plank position. The plank position has really started to bother my wrists. In the abdominal circuit there is a little bit of plank, but you're on your elbow instead of your hand. This kettle bell workout has more squats then say the Jillian Michael's kettle bell dvd.",1390953600,2,605,4.5

3589268,1,B001FTW9Z4,"Please trust me on this one, if you do not know how to properly use a kettle bell, please do NOT buy this DVD until you do.  You could really injure yourself. Why?  Because the instructor doesn't even use a kettle bell throughout this entire workout!  (Seriously 10 Minute Solutions?  Seriously?) I have been using kettle bells for a long time and wanted to add to my DVD collection of kettle bell workouts.  I couldn't believe that NOT ONCE on this DVD does the instructor (1) use a kettle bell or (2) even explain the proper technique.  Ridiculous. If you know how to properly use a kettle bell, this DVD is OK.  There are better out there.  I highly recommend Jillian Michael's 'Shred It With Weights'.  It's a FANTASTIC Kettle Bell workout (there are two actually on the DVD) that will really kick your butt!",1381017600,4,812,4.544827586206897

calories in a short period of time.  The trainer speaks well and gives a good heads up on the next moves, none
of which are all that complicated. I am able to swing around my 20 lb kettlebell with no problem. If you
are just starting out with kettlebell, use a much lower weight kettlebell or 3-5 lb weight until you get
the movement down well.  You could really throw out your back if you do it wrong.",1375315200,,512,3.9514563106796117
3589270,2,B001FTW9Z4,"This DVD loses its first star because the instructor uses a dumbbell instead of a kettlebell. I find this to be rather ridiculous, for a kettlebell workout. I mean, come on, what's the point?

Then, it loses another star, because its ill-conceived. A couple of the sections are barely discernible from each other. The same moves (such as the basic kettlebell swing and the ""clean"") are used over and over again.  The instructor does not seem experienced or very knowledgeable in kettlebell techniques (for example she does not explain the difference between a squat and a kettlebell hip hinge). She also doesn't use good general weight lifting techniques; ie she lowers her elbow lower than her shoulder when executing a shoulder press.  This does not keep the press activated, so you lose the muscle contraction.

Then, the DVD lost an additional star, when during the upper body segment; they miss an entire exercise for the left side.  The shoulder press for the left side is entirely missing! This seems like workout DVD sacrilege; quite unforgivable!

I leave it at two stars, because I do like the ""10 Minute Solutions"" overall format and production.  I own and enjoy several of their DVDs.  I think, if you can get this for a substantial discount, its worth getting if you want a very simple low-key kettlebell/dumbbell workout. But, if you are looking for good kettlebell instruction or a workout with lots of variety, then this isn't the one for you.",1374451200,2,1459,4.8785425101214575
3589271,4,B001FTW9Z4,"I would have preferred to have seen Dr. Olsen using kettlebells to make sure I am using proper form.  Its a little hard to follow the dumbbells when you are using kettlebells.  That being said, this is a good workout with my kettlebells - I found the workout to be a good challenge.  I use this with the Kathy Smith kettlebell workout and its a solid overall workout.  The abs workout was a tad tough so I do more planks and mountain climbers and pilates to offset this.

I give this 4 stars as it is a good workout - it does not get 5 stars because it is missing the kettlebell itself, which is why I bought this in the first place.

3589273,4,B001FTW9Z4,"I got this DVD because Michelle Olson kicked butt in the Legs DVD I purchased back in April. There is A LOT of repetition in both DVDs. I got through the whole DVD which is about 50+ minutes the first time around. With the repetition of the leg work swinging your hips forward, I found myself not using proper form all the time and had to remind myself to lean back into my heels more. It didn't bother me one bit that she doesn't use a kettle bell - she provides clear instruction for either weight you decide you use. Michelle incorporates legs, arms & abs as the segments are broken up into 10 minutes each. The workout is there; but it's not one of my favorites. I will continue to rotate this DVD alwith my other workout DVDs though. Try her other DVD instead - Perfect Legs Glutes & Abs with Dr Michele Olson.",1369526400,,815,4.264516129032258

3589292,3,B001FTW9Z4,"This is the DVD that really introduced me to the kettlebell motions. I started out using a 5-lb dumbbell and I really felt it the next day.

Then I progressed to more kettlebell specific DVDs and learned more technique.

When I came back to this DVD to use it with my kettlebell, I still like the exercises, but her form is all wrong for anyone using a kettlebell. And anyone new to kettlebells--using this DVD--will more than likely be injured if they actually use a kettlebell--which is ironic. Someone else pointed out two of my complaints--she doesn't rack the weight, and it goes too fast if you're using proper technique--but the most dangerous thing she does is switch the weight overhead.  It's not just potentially injurious--it's potentially lethal if a 10-lb weight slips and cracks your skull.

I can recommend using this DVD with a dumbbell, but if you really want to learn about using a kettlebell, look elsewhere.",1331856000,6,928,4.817610062893082
3589293,1,B001FTW9Z4,"The most annoying thing - as previously mentioned - is that there's no kettlebell. (It would have been much better if there was at least another person in the video using a kettlebell.)

So here's a few challenges that make this almost useless for those who want to use a kettlebell with this DVD:

1. Olson uses weight-training names to approximate kettlebell moves. For example, she says ""curls"" when the nearest kettlebell equivalent to what she's doing is a ""clean."" And of course because she's using a dumbell, a curl is exactly what she's doing. (A curl is a straight hinge motion, where a clean includes a twisting motion.)

If you know kettlebells, you know how to do a clean so it's just annoying. But if you're using this DVD and you're new to kettlebells, substitutions like these can be confusing and possibly lead to injury.

2. The other big challenge is the pace. Since she's using a light dumbell, the pace of each move is way too fast for kettlebell users. A kettlebell is an offset, usually-heavier weight, not a light, balanced weight, and to try to keep pace with her on this DVD can be downright dangerous.

Some kettlebell moves, like an overhead press starting with the weight held low, usually have an intermediate step where you rack the kettlebell before you press it up. This little extra step makes the overall move take slightly longer but keeps you in control of the weight. But because she's using a dumbbell, she never racks the weight first, so keeping pace with her can cause someone to get sloppy - and get hurt.

I've honestly tried - repeatedly - to like this DVD, but finally gave up. It's not worth getting hurt over. All in all this was a great concept but very poorly executed.",1329350400,56,1718,4.616393442622951

I thought it was a warmup, but that was the workout. SAVE YOUR MONEY!

I've never written an angry review on Amazon.com before, but this is just so obviously someone cashing in on a trend without bothering to buy a single kettlebell! The trainer is in average shape, in no way looks like she works out with kettlebells or even heavy weights.

I found my kettelbell cumbersome and too heavy for the exercises on this DVD. The instructor Michelle Olson is excellent,and she uses a dumbell throughout the routines. It's the kettlebell technique which engages all the muscle groups in the body, that makes this workout effective.

3589298,5,B001FTW9Z4,"UPDATE TO EARLIER REVIEW

I agree with the poster about why there's confusion about this being a fraudulent Kettle Bell workout.  It clearly states (on the cover) that no Kettle Bell is needed.  Also, in my opinion, as with any form of exercise, depending upon the exercise being performed, you adjust how heavy of a weight you use.  I believe 5 pounds is too light for the buns workout; however, for certain parts of the upper body workout, it's appropriate.  Just because the pace is fast paced, doesn't mean this video is dangerous or prone to injury.  If you're performing reps at a faster pace, you're not going to go with a heavier weight.  Same with if you're going to run a marathon, you're not going to run at the same pace as you would a 5K.  I am guessing the reason she is using 5 pounds IS because it's fast paced.  To me, she would have been irresponsible if she suggested using a 20 pound weight.  This video is not meant to use a heavy weight.  Jillian Michael's video, they do use 20 pound Kettle Bells; however, the pace is much slower.

As with anything, this exercise is no more dangerous than anything else if you utilize common sense.  I had never done a Kettle Bell workout prior to this one; and nearly a year later, I am still using this workout, with proven results and no injury whatsoever.  In fact, my initial reason for wanting to update this review is because for the first time, I used a dumbbell instead of the Kettle Bell and found, particularly for exercises for the upper body, the dumbbell worked much better.  It's because when she performs a ""clean"", which she does perform with a twist, using an evenly weighted tool versus one where it's bottom heavy, is less strenuous on your arm.  So from now on, I will alternate between the Kettle Bell and the dumbbell.

In the end, though, doesn't it come down to exercise?  I don't care how many new fads they come out with or new ways to do this or do that, it's all about calories in versus calories out.  Does it really make a difference whether it's done with a Kettle Bell or a dumbbell if you're achieving the same results?  Since a 10 pd Kettle Bell weighs the same as a 10 pound dumbbell, unless someone can show me that two people of comparable size and weight doing the exact same workout with a Kettle Bell and a dumbbell of the same weight, the Kettle Bell workout will produce better results, I will retract my statement.

I suppose it comes down to this workout isn't for everyone.  I tried Amy Benton's; Jillian Michael's and a few others and while they are all good, I prefer this one.  However, I wouldn't knock the others because, as stated, they're not for me.

PRIOR REVIEW
As with the previous reviewer, I too own several 10 Min Solutions DVDs and love them all.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this one; however, I have to say that I was impressed.

I also concur with the other reviewer that this is a great introduction to the kettlebell workout.  The moves are not complex or overly choreographed; however, you will do a LOT of squats.  Even with the upperbody workout, you're squatting.  For me, who loves to do squats, this workout is ideal.

To describe this workout would be to say that it does the basics.  If one looks at all the new ways in which exercise has changed/evolved, all that everyone has done is take the basics and added new twists.  Instead of cruches on your back, we now do standing crunches.  But it's still a crunch.  Same with this video.  She uses the tried and true methods, coupled with multiple reps, to achieve results.  I do 4 segments at a time and I am dripping with sweat.  I've used 5 and 10 pound kettlebells throughout the workout and it works just fine.

If you're looking for a good intro to kettlebell workouts without having to worry about twisting and turning and stepping here and pushing there, etc., BUT still want to get a very good workout, please give this a try.",1307404800,20,3921,4.447405329593268
3589299,5,B001FTW9Z4,"I had decided to try this at first with regular weights, and then see if I liked using the kettlebell enough to purchase one.  Either way, with regular hand weights or with a kettlebell, it works great.  There are five 10 minute workouts: Maximum heart burner, Upper body power sculpt, Thigh & Buns Blaster, Total body sculpt, Accelerated Ab toner.

I really enjoy Michelle Olson and I dare say that I enjoy her much more than some of the other 10 Minute Solution instructors.  I own six of the 10 Minute Solution DVD's including this one.  At the beginning introductory dialogue, I can tell she is a little nervous.  To me that's okay, I actually like it.  It means that she's a little more relateable than other instructors, who overdramatize themselves once the camera starts rolling.  There are no ""backup dancers"" which I absolutely enjoy and that is indicative of any of the 10 Minute Solution workouts. Michelle does the entire workout with you.  She gives great cues and explains the moves well - I can tell she wants to prevent any kind of injury and is concious of it without being annoying.  I think she does a better job of this than the other 10 Minute Solution instructors I currently own.  She communicates well and if she had other workouts available, I would purchase them.

The ab toner is great for beginners.  It's challenging, not like Ab X challenging, but you will still feel it the next day until you get used to it.  My two favorites are the first two - Maximum fat burner and Upper body power sculpt.

For three months, I did a variance of three of the workouts 5 days a week after doing 20-30 minutes of treadmill beforehand (1 minute slower, 1 minute fast and the last two minutes fast).  Then I began P90X and found P90X to be challenging but I wasn't very sore the next day, like my co-workers were, who had begun that program without much exercise beforehand.  This is a great overall workout, you will not only deveop your arms but your chest and back - as well as your thigh muscles.  If you have really bad knees, then modify the moves if you can to build enough momentum to use as one action with the kettlebell.

If you like kettlebell or want to begin, this is a great DVD to do it with.",1299196800,30,2224,4.46039603960396

3589301,5,B001FTW9Z4,"Though this DVD is not yet for sale, I have seen a preview copy. I have a Master's Degree in Exercise Physiology and am a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS). The workout is solid. The video shows how to correctly use a dumbbell for kettlebell exercises. Kettlebell owners will take-to the movement combinations using a mid-weight (5 - 10) pound kettlebell. The workout was also tested in a physiology laboratory as reported elsewhere - which is important for both consumers and trainers who may use the exercises in the DVD for themselves or to condition others. I plan to purchase several for gifts for my clients.",1227225600,,634,4.934579439252336
3589302,1,B001FTW9Z4,This workout uses a dumbbell--not a kettlebell as the cover would like to persuade you into believing.  Simply put it's deceptive and I can't believe it is marketed as a lie.,1223942400,11,174,4.612903225806452
3589303,1,B001FTW9Z4,"I just want to add to what has already been stated in an effort to make sure this information stays current. I own many workout dvds and I know what it is like to be mislead by renamed releases and false titles. this is not a kettlebell workout. A dumbell is used and the weight distribution for kettlebells and dumbells is not similar. the kettlebell and exercises that use it are functional and challenge the muscles in ways a dumbell cannot. 10 min solutions workouts are typically well made, effective and accurately titled, please act responsibly and retitle this one. Thank you.",1223856000,16,584,4.735294117647059

I am a Fitness Fan and a fan of the workout that is coming out soon. I train with the instructor whose been teaching this type of workout to me and others when I exercise for nearly a year. Get ahold of your kettlebell or a dumbbell that is not more than 10 pounds (Yes! it is not required for you to have a kettlebell to do the kettlebell moves as printed on the DVD cover). You will sweat and tone just about all the muscles in your body doing the sequences of kettlebell exercises. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",1223856000,3,767,5.5

8302737,1,B001FTW9Z4,"WHY this fitness instructor has a picture of her with a kettlebell and then uses a dumbbell to do ""kettle bell exercises"" makes no sense! It is very irresponsible to have people use a piece of fitness equipment without proper instruction. I personally went to a personal trainer to ""get down the proper form"" before even attempting to exercise with a kettle bell. You can injure your back if you do not use kettle bells properly. Lots of other kettle bell exercise DVD's out there that show proper instruction before beginning...don't waste your time with this one!",1473206400,,565,4.835051546391752
8302738,5,B001FTW9Z4,"I really like this series.  I have several of the 10 minuet solution videos.  Great for beginners, I picked up my first while nursing an injury. However they are also a great work out for days you cant hit the gym.  This particular video also gets your heart rate up as kettle bell includes some cardio.  You can run through the entire video, or chose 10 min sections of the video, mix, match, or redo any of the videos you'd like.  I really like the options this video gives you, I also really like this one over others as you know each section is 10 min.  I feel this makes it easy to plan your workout.",1438041600,2,605,4.172413793103448

8302740,2,B001FTW9Z4,"I am just getting back into working out and wanted a fast, yet effective, workout to help get back on track.  This is the perfect workout for me, but it is definitely not a kettle bell workout.  Other then the introduction part, where she tell you about the different workouts included on the DVD, and holding the kettle bell in her hand, you don't see again.  It isn't used in ANY of the workouts.  The workouts flow nicely and I do work up a little sweat.  They start with a nice warm up and end with a nice cool down.  They are not hard and has allowed me to stay pretty consistent, but this is definitely NOT a kettle bell workout.  Even though she states you can use your kettle bell instead of the hand held weight she uses throughout all of the workouts, I found it hard to follow along with mine.  Being kind of new to the kettle bell, and her just using a single hand held weight, my biggest concern is proper form.  Maybe someone who has used the kettle bell and familiar with proper form, would be okay.  But if you are not, I wouldn't recommend it, you may hurt yourself and do more damage than good.  Overall, a good beginner workout, and a not so great kettle bell workout.  If you are looking for a kettle bell workout, do not buy this DVD.",1425340800,2,1255,4.226890756302521
8302741,5,B001FTW9Z4,"Very challenging for me. Five 10 minute workouts that each focus on different sections of your body. Love the way that you choose as many of the workouts you want to do for the day at the beginning, then it plays only the workouts you pick. She demonstrates using a dumbbell instead of a kettlebell. Its okay, but I don't know why.",1424563200,,331,4.354838709677419

8302744,1,B001FTW9Z4,"As a 10-Minute Solution fan who tried just about every DVD they have, I'm grossly disappointed in this so-called Kettle Bell Fat Burner. Even though the cover photo shows the instructor holding a kettle bell, in the actual workouts she demonstrates with a dumbbell. This is both misleading and irresponsible, because the use of kettle bell shifts the center of gravity and provides a different challenge. Wrong grip on kettle bell during exercising can result in injuries and that's why a kettle bell DVD should demonstrate the moves with kettle bell and not an ordinary dumb bell. The instructor wants to broaden her appeal by saying that her exercises are good with either dumb bell or kettle bell. But then a responsible way would be having an assistant demonstrate with a dumb bell in the background while she demonstrates with a kettle bell. Furthermore, the exercises are uninspired. If you are an experienced with dumb bell workouts, this is nothing new nor invigorating to truly burn fat.",1405641600,4,996,4.970059880239521
8302745,1,B001FTW9Z4,She works out with dumbells. Not a kettlebell. So the title is mis leading. The video is pretty mediocre but for cheap enough it's okay I guess.,1402185600,,144,4.37037037037037
