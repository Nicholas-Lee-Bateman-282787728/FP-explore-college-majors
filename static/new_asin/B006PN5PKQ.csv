8502836,5,B006PN5PKQ,"The ESPN Films: 2011 Collection, Volume 1 set was great. It's a combination of films that ESPN made and aired on TV years back. I enjoyed Catching Hell: The Steve Bartman Cubs story. That was fun, sad, and cool to relive. The Fab Five was gripping. The music in Charismatic was memorable.  5 star set. The other films were great as well to watch. The set also includes: Herschel, Renee, and Charismatic. I would caution parents not to show Renee to the kids. Some people might not enjoy that episode as much. It was tough subject material dealing with a transgender tennis star.",1487721600,,578,4.611650485436893
8502837,5,B006PN5PKQ,"Not a fan of ESPN anymore as they have become way too political and pandering over recent years. I watch a sports channel for sports, not political commentary. Buy what can you say? They make the best sports documentaries out there and this one is no exception for the most part. A couple of the episodes are boring but for the price, you can't beat it overall. Recommended.",1477440000,,374,4.514705882352941
