Miguel Nunez Jr. does a great job in this film and was the most entertaining. Of course the two girls on the cover didn't hurt, they along with the other girls didn't have much lines, but they were great to look at. I guess that's why their models. Anyways it's worth watching at least once.",1300924800,2,427,4.417721518987341
8363515,2,B002C7ELX6,"Diamond Dawgs is about what you'd expect from a straight-to-DVD urban movie. The story isn't especially original, the acting is weak, and the movie looks like it was shot with a digital camcorder. The majority of the actors have only been in a few straight to video movies, and this is the first film debut for all of the car thief actresses. The soundtrack is actually decent, though, with the score ranging from Egyptian tabla to a few hot tracks by the Dogg Pound.

The irony of the movie is that the actors with the most film experience, Miguel A. Nez Jr. (South Central) and Adam Cardon (Detective Anderson), probably get the least screen time of the major characters. The dialogue was dull, and most of the comedic writing wasn't funny. If I had to guess, I'd say that the movie was financed by a modeling agency that wanted to help launch the careers of some of the women that it represented.

The only thing that made the film tolerable was that a number of gorgeous women were cast in the lead roles. Stunning East Indian beauty Avnit Arora plays Kali, the hard-talking member of the crew. Curvy Korrina Rico is cast as shotgun-toting Sneaky, and the lovely Azur-De Johnson plays love interest to one of the crew's robbery victims. This is the first real film for any of these models, so it's obviously too early to judge them on their acting. If there was a benefit to the movie, it's that I'm now aware of these incredible looking models, and can follow their careers.

Beyond the models, I really didn't find this movie entertaining, but that's my opinion. Give it a rent, and decide for yourself if it's worth adding to your collection.",1266624000,3,1649,4.6020408163265305
