8126596,3,B000FTP2Y0,"Cheesy 90s Bollywood fun. Gotta love a hero that can get half way through a triathalon, beat off a bunch of bad guys, then continue for miles on a bicycle race after so many punches to the solar plexus. Not my favorite Aamir Khan movie, but it had its moments of fun and was worth a few hours of my time to watch. I probably would not watch it a second time.",1447027200,,358,3.986111111111111
8126597,5,B000FTP2Y0,"One of the best ""growing up"" movie ever. The final cycle race gives ""the goose bump"" even to this day. I hope Mansoor Khan makes more movies. A freshness and innocence -- that is difficult to find in movies these days.",1438214400,,218,4.341463414634147
