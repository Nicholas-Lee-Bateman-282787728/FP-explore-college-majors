5853705,4,B00DSQIWEE,"During World War II, a caped hero (and his twin brother) fights the Mask, a Nazi saboteur in America. War time serial follows the usual formula but does is quite well. The stunt work is impressive and fine use is made of local sites as distinctive and visually unique sets.
 Kane Richmond, wearing riding boots and flying ace headgear, ably stars as the apparent free agent in a nearly single handed battle to rid America of enemy agents. The female lead, Marguerite Chapman, plays a nearly disposable role as daughter of Spy Smasher's military liaison and the girl friend of his brother.
The villain, while believable to a certain extent, is much too mundane. An action serial of this nature calls for a evil mastermind to give cinematic balance to the rather flamboyant hero.
The cover blurb cites this movie as one of the greatest movie serial ever made. As a fan of serials, I am not ready to make that judgement without another viewing or two but it is undeniably well done and worth a look from any fan.",1408665600,3,1009,4.605555555555555
5853706,3,B00DSQIWEE,"""Spy Smasher"" from 1942 is regarded as one of the best serials from Republic Pictures, with good stunt work and well-choreographed fight scenes, directed by William Witney with plenty of action supported by a superb musical score under the direction of Mort Glickman.  The plot moves in a logical fashion and the situations seem believable, acting quite good by serial movie standards, and there is a seriousness of purpose common to Republic's wartime serials.  Outdoor photography is first rate, and it includes interesting industrial locations.  If the interiors of those plants look like they redressed the same set, and a couple of the cliffhangers were lifted out of earlier serials, it is all edited well and the story moves along nicely, with no sense of ""filler"" anywhere in the twelve chapters.

Republic didn't make many changes to the title character, with Alan Armstrong (Kane Richmond) as a masked vigilante fighting Nazi agents prior to the United States' entry in the War.  In the serial he acquires a twin brother, Jack, which helps keep his identity a secret even from Admiral Corby (Sam Flint), Commissioner of Naval Intelligence, whose daughter Eve (Margurite Chapman) is engaged to Jack.  The Nazis are headed by ""The Mask"" (Hans Schumm) who occasionally covers his face, but for some reason only when giving orders by television.  His agents include Drake (Tristram Coffin) whose televised program with Admiral Corby allows leaking confidential information by leaving the camera turned on when the news service is excluded from the room.

Both DVD editions currently listed by Amazon appear to be sourced from Republic's commercial videotape release, and while watchable neither is free from digital compression artifacts and a few other transfer issues.

The one available from Hodgepodge, identified as distributed by ATI, AudioTape Inc., has all 3 hours, 34 minutes of the serial on one single-layer DVD-R disc.  No ""extras"" are provided, and only a second or two of blank space separates the chapters.  A head-switch glitch appears near the bottom of the screen, as expected from a copy sourced from a videotape, and while the image is sharp the digital compression causes some ""grainy"" patterns, seen mostly in the darker areas and made worse by containing spurious colors, which also show up in a few places with tight patterns of vertical lines, like corrugated metal panels or automobile grilles.  This can be corrected by turning off the monitor's color, or at least reducing the saturation, and unlike ATI's release of ""The Shadow"" the action remains smooth.  Sound quality is similar to that of Republic's videotape edition, with some ""choppy"" modulation and buzz in a few chapters, but at least there is no added distortion due to attempts to ""enhance"" the sound.  Brightness and contrast levels remain fairly reasonable.  Chapter 12 shows some tracking problems in the source tape; the opening credits were replaced with those from Chapter 11 with MPPDA certificate number 7961, and there is vertical instability from the chapter title through the ""recap"" text, jumping between the vertical sync pulse and the head-switch point of the videotape.  A short distance into the chapter a somewhat inferior source tape was substituted for about four minutes, with some ""hiss"" in the sound.  While smoothly edited, the patching is obvious, and the rest of the chapter has occasional minor vertical jitter.  The cover of the DVD case has a list of chapter titles and two pictures, both printed backwards; the steering wheel of the car would not be on the right.  There's another reversal that is more entertaining; the last chapter title should be ""V ..._"" but it was printed ""_... V"" so instead of ""V for Victory"" the Morse Code would be ""B,"" presumably for ""Bungling.""  But despite the shortcomings the ATI edition is watchable and the menu works properly.

Since Amazon is separating the reviews, I'll detail the faults of the release on two DVD-R discs, available from Bill Black's AC Comics under its listing, see ASIN: B00GWSH1UQ, but while it doesn't have the tracking issues in the last chapter, and there are fewer compression artifacts, there is some roughness to the motion and other minor issues that keep it from being a clear choice over ATI's.

My 30-year-old Beta-format videotape copy gives a cleaner image than either of these DVD-R's, though not by a lot.  Rumors have been around for a dozen years that there might be an ""official"" DVD release, but until that happens these editions provide adequate access to one of the best serials of the sound era.",1402704000,25,4598,5.068965517241379
5853707,5,B00DSQIWEE,"I don't give out ""stars"" for movies.  But for the purposes of recommendation I give this a Five Bags of Pop-Corn!!!
I waited a long time for this serial to be re-released; worth every second of cursing, anxious hand wringing, damning the folks who didn't seem to be listening to my persistent pleas.  This is ACTION folks: Fist fights, car chases, fast moving aero-planes!  I watched the entire 12 chapters with my 11 year old grand-son over a period of five nights.  His father caught him three times trying to sneak peeks at the next chapter.  That's how cool this excellent chapter play is.  So buy it, pop it in the player, make a big batch of pop-corn, put your feet up on the coffee table, and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.  I guarantee you will.",1398038400,10,743,4.5

5853711,5,B00DSQIWEE,"This is one of the best ""cliff-hanger"" serials made by Republic.
The DVD made in 2005 of the 1942 film is very well done.
The quality of the film is unusually good for a film of this vintage!
Essentially all of the 12 chapters contain fight scenes which are very well performed. The actors/stunt-men do a great job.
A bat plane and ray-gun look to be well ahead of their time!
The closing chapter has a twist which is a bit unusual...",1463011200,5,434,4.304878048780488

8597255,5,B00DSQIWEE,Without a doubt one of the best serials made.  Non-stop action from beginning to end with more brawling (God knows how many tables and chairs were destroyed) and shoot outs than anything I've seen on film.  Richmond makes for a decent leading man and the production values seem pretty decent for a serial.,1525219200,,305,4.735849056603773
8597256,5,B00DSQIWEE,"If you don't like serials, and you can't relate to the years that came before your time like many of this generation's under 40 crowd  yeah, you're gonna have trouble with this....and with ""Casablanca,"" and with ""Grand Hotel,"" and with ""The Gold Rush,"" and with ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" and with ""All About Eve,"" and with many other creations that are hailed by those who actually know what they're talking about as great masterpieces of writing, acting and storytelling.

The fact that what is possibly the greatest serial ever made receives some of the jabs I've read here is an awfully depressing commentary on the uneducated and jaded nature of today's younger audience. What they call ""corny"" is actually better writing than much of the nonsense we see today that passes for plot or dialogue. Such talented efforts as those of the 1940s are just so foreign to many nowadays that I suppose it throws them for a loop.

But if you have a love of the pop culture of the 1920s-1940s as I do (specifically radio, movie features, movie serials, classic comic strips and Golden Age comic books), ignore the illiterate noise. You'll love this and many other serials from 1936-50. Many of them are essentially comic books or radio adventures on film  a great time capsule. And when it came to serials, Republic was tops in my opinion. For what it's worth, I was born in 1965  but have a deep appreciation of these decades and the times they represent. So you see, what era you grew up in doesn't have to limit you.

As for the transfer, that's a slightly different story. I'd give that about 3 stars or so   but, understand that right now it's as good as it's going to get. Unfortunately many serials have not gotten the remastering treatment due to various obstacles (though we can only hope that will change after the recent blu ray releases of ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" and ""Daredevils of the Red Circle.""). However, this edition certainly watchable and enjoyable, and beats not having it at all.

So if you're already into this stuff, jump right on in. If you're younger and don't ""get it"" and are too worried about what current culture pressures you into liking or disliking...open your mind and transport yourself into the shoes of someone in the early 40s  listening to reports on the radio of faraway lands, staring at those old radio dials with both a gleam and a bit of fear in your eyes.",1518566400,,2409,4.673758865248227
