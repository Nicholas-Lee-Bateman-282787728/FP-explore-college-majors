8730663,1,B014GAEZ64,"This is the worst production of Tannhauser ever.  Visually, it's classic idiotic Eurotrash at its worst.  Kollo should have retired long before this depressing spectacle.  He sounds and looks more like Tannhauser's grandfather!  The rest of the singing is fair to middling and Mehta just goes through the motions and does little more than keep time.  The MET will be reviving their near perfect production this fall.  Don't miss it!",1441584000,2,432,5.1
