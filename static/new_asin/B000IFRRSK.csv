All journeys have a beginning, and the very short journey of AVRT (Addictive Voice Recognition Technique) based recovery can start right here. On a day when you haven't been using, watch this DVD and get started in AVRT-based recovery, a decision that will utterly change  your life.

This is a good ""gift"" to give to the addicted person you care about. It that addicted person is you, then so much the better!

No one expects much of addicted people in our culture, especially addicted people themselves. This video shows the ""recover with an attitude"" aspect of AVRT-based recovery, and helps you to set the realistic goal of prompt, total recovery. Only a narrow range of options exists for addicted people, and they are presented here through the lens of AVRT, in the unique style of RR founder, Jack Trimpey.
