8295171,5,B001DWNUEW,let me just say i love elitexc and ufc and i thought this pay per view was great and full of excitement and i thought the best match was kimbo slice vs colossus thompson the elitexc middleweight title match was great also it was between Robbie Lawler vs Scott smith and i really don't think the middleweight title match should have ended under controversy. or the Kimbo slice vs Colossus Thompson should have ended under controversy either. This show was perfect.,1258588800,2,463,4.728395061728395
8295172,1,B001DWNUEW,"""The show was horrible and may have set MMA back several years.  If EliteXC's future was really riding on this show, then they should be going bankrupt soon."" - mushemush",1227312000,2,170,4.666666666666667
