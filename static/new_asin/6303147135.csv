The acting is a little better than a loose tooth but it was the ending that made me want to crank up the special chair to 20,000 volts.

Really?
Do we REALLY think that is how it ended?

 I would take the time to contact the writers but clearly the deed has been done and there is no taking back or apologizing for this Hollywood code / Pollyanna windup.

573837,5,6303147135,"What a wonderful romantic film.  An almost perfect inverse of ""Brief Encounter,"" also by directed by David Lean and also starring Trevor Howard.  The ""encounter"" in Passionate Friends is lifelong, but equally as intense as in Brief Encounter, which lasted but a month or two, and yet both stories have very similar outcomes.

As I say often to my wife, men are the genuine romantics; women are much too practical.

My two cents.",1371427200,2,428,4.821917808219178
573838,1,6303147135,"David Lean and Trevor Howard matched up again in a story of doomed love.  They earlier worked together on Brief Encounter that had a very similar story line.  The difference, though, is that Brief Encounter had the services of Noel Coward.  ""Passionate"" was with not as a distinguished a screenplay writer.  I don't mean specific insult, but Coward is Coward so how can one be insulted by not meeting that level.

I didn't expect that there would be similarities when I watched this movie, but various things matched too noticeably so that it was obvious that Lean was borrowing rather heavily.  An example is the dramatic use of the train station and the first person narration (used much less effectively in this movie).  My main problem here was that the female lead-character was simply not too likeable.  In Encounters, it was obvious why she was with her husband (she knew him first).  But in Passionate, she knew the Howard character first and left him for the other guy.  The only explanation hinted at was that she was too shallow to accept her true love's lesser living style (not poverty level, but just not mega rich).  Well that might happen in real life, but that doesn't make you a likeable person.

The acting too was much more stylized and strained.  I know that was the common style then, but I couldn't help but think as to how the movie audience was so accepting of the ""reality"" genre that grew so popular in the 1950's when they were left with such less realistic mannerisms and emotions from movies such as this one.

In sum, if you want a good, old movie of illicit love that can be fashioned into a current day message, then go to Coward and Lean's Brief Encounters.  Passionate Friends simply tried too hard to do too much with far less effect.",1370304000,,1770,4.610223642172524
573839,3,6303147135,"I'm a big admirer of director David Lean, as well as producer Ronald Neame (later a fine director in his own right) and actors Claude Rains and Trevor Howard, which might have led to my slight disappointment in 1949's 'The Passionate Friends.'  Not that its French exteriors and English interiors aren't beautifully framed and shot-- they are-- or its melodrama sincerely performed-- it is; the problem I have with the film as a whole is its narrative structure.  It begins almost immediately with a flashback, then a flashback within that flashback-- rather a clunky way to tell a simple 90-minute story about a love triangle inasmuch as nothing of particular importance happens in these early scenes aside from establishing that such a relationship does indeed exist between our three principals (Ann Todd being the third).  Then, somewhere around the midway point, when the movie reverts to present-day action (trying not to give away anything), what we have is more or less a repeat of what we've already been shown, with very little character or plot development colored in to propel us toward the (somewhat contrived) second-act crisis and third-act resolution.  This all sounds unnecessarily abstract as criticism, I know, but had the film a better flow (like Lean's superior 'Brief Encounter'), or been afforded epic length and detail (like most of his post-1950 work), I don't think these things would have been as noticeably anticlimactic dressed as they are with such lavish trimmings.  In any case, it's a good movie, with excellent qualities worth seeing, that might have been great.  3-plus stars.",1363996800,8,1611,5.129770992366412
573840,5,6303147135,"A Review of the movie The Passionate Friends

Notorious II

From the very beginning this movie reminded me of the movie Notorious. I had recently purchased a copy of Notorious. Indeed it was my third purchase of Notorious, as the other two purchased several years ago, were, or became defective so the story was one in which I was very familiar. Indeed that has been one of my all time favorites.

The comparisons are rather striking.

1. Claude Rains was the male lead in both movies. In each movie the leading man entered into a marriage that soon became very vulnerable.
In Notorious, his wife (Ingrid Berman) was involved with another man, (Cary Grant), a CIA agent.
In The Passionate Friends, his wife (Ann Todd) was involved with another man (Trevor Howard), a highly successful scientist and professor.

2. In Notorious, Rains plays the role of a former Nazi officer, in charge of a group of former Nazi officers in Rio, in 1946. They are in Brazil, working on finding uranium deposits.
In The Passionate Friends, Rains plays the role of a highly successful banker.

3. Both movies have extremely complex plots and relationshps.
In Notorious, Rains discovers after a few weeks of bliss, that he is married to a woman who is a very close friend of a CIA agent. He seeks help from his mother (Leopoldine Konstantin), and tells her: I am married to a CIA agent. He says he will kill her. She cautions him that he cannot do anything that would lead the other nazi officers to discover his predicament, or they will have to eliminate him. She comes up with a plan to very gradually poison Bergman, so that she will ultimately die of an undiagnosed illness. At that point Grant reenters the movie and rescues her from the Nazi residence, ostensibly taking her to a hospital.

Inputs, from three reviews on The Passionate Friends, are used below.

(a) Wikipedia. The story is told by episodes of memories by Todd while on holiday in Switzerland. This movie goes into the past and tells of the true love between Todd and Howard. However Todd decides to end this relationship and instead chooses Rains, who gives her affection, stability and security.

(b) Amazon.com. In this review, the focus is on Ann Todd as the woman between two men: her husband (Claude Rains) and her first love (Trevor Howard). There are flashbacks to a Switzerland vacation. The infidelity gets a funny spin by Rains business with Germany and Italy pre WW2. This film was made in post WW2, which allowed Rains to speak of the Teutonic hysteriah of the Germans.

(c) Turner Classic Movies. This is organized by key individuals in order of their presentation.
(i)David Lean was the second and primary director in this movie, and was heavily involved with the lives of the principals.
(ii)Trevor Howard plays a variation of the character that brought him so much attention and acclaim in Leanfs earlier drama: Brief Encounter (1945). This was a non stressful shot for Howard as it was filmed in Switzerland. In his spare time he could get in some skiing and mountain climbing.
(iii)Ann Todd. In contrast it was more stressful for Todd and Lean as they were having an affair. They had been having an affair for some time and they finally married in 1949.
(iv)Claude Rains. He was troubled by what he saw on the set. Rains disliked Todd, who he felt had wasted everyonefs time with her prima donna behavior. Rains was also concerned by Leanfs personal life, which seemed to be slipping over onto the set and affecting the picture. He also knew that Lean was seeing a psychoanalyst. Yet, Rains recognized Leans immense talent and said: I cannot say enough about the man as a director. He is magnificent.

Indeed both movies had extremely complex plots. And indeed the comparisons between the two movies was rather striking Somehow the writers and direction was able to end the movie on a happy note with Rains back with Todd and Howard back with his own wife and family.",1310083200,,3938,4.725947521865889
573841,5,6303147135,"I only wish it were available at Amazon on DVD---I happened to see it on one of the cable movie channels today and immediately wanted it but guess I'll have to wait on availability---Ann Todd is, I believe, such an underrated actress---she gave such a fine performance here, as well as in The Paradine Case and especially also in Madeleine---the story line in this movie has elements of another Trevor Howard masterpiece, Brief Encounter (particularly the use made of trains relative to the female lead), tho the timeline in Encounter was measured in weeks while in Friends we view a love affair over a number of years---the romantic (limited as it may have been) pairing of Ann Todd with Claude Rains was an interesting May-December combination which found greater importance in putting the Todd character in best perspective---bittersweet romantic elements mixed with intrigue and set in glamorous locations all made for an absolutely satisfying two hours---and take note of the delight in Ann Todd's observations as she sets out on holiday in the very beginning: airborne, she revels in the abundance of white bread, butter, creme and fresh fruit served to her, all things generally unavailable to Britons even then (1946) and certainly during the war years",1309824000,6,1260,5.091787439613527
573842,5,6303147135,"The emotions that drive the characters in this story are timeless.  Rarely is a love story told so satisfyingly.  The acting is controlled yet believable, with Ann Todd as the wife, Claude Raines as the wealthy husband, and Trevor Howard as the wife's ""friend.""  Ann Todd's beautiful, intelligent face reflects emotions that she tries to control.  Claude Raines hides his feelings under a calculating manner.  Trevor Howard is understated and irresistably romantic, as he was in another excellent film, Brief Encounter of 1945.  This movie has engaging characters,  beautiful photography, and good music.  It's a classic created with restraint and elegance.",1245974400,16,657,5.435643564356436
573843,2,6303147135,"This Rank/Cineguild production directed by David Lean is based on a novel by H G Wells, here adapted by Lean and Stanley Haynes, though with a screenplay credited to Eric Ambler. Although the plot is about a triangle, Lean's focus is on Ann Todd as the woman between two men, her husband and the man who was her first love but whom she refused to marry. Her situation is presented in an exchange between the man, Trevor Howard and Todd - ""If two people really love each other they want to be together. They want to belong to each other"", Todd - ""I want to belong to myself"", ""Then your life will be a failure"". However in the tradition of upper class Brits, Todd's life of failure means a marriage to a successful banker, Claude Rains.
The narrative has an unusual triple flashback structure, which is perhaps why it needed three writers, with the present being narrated by Todd with the prospect of a divorce, and flashbacks to the vacation in Switzerland where the instigating incident occurs, Todd's memory/flashback of 9 years earlier re-meeting Howard, and small memories of their first romance. The initial meeting is tainted by lines like Todd's ""Why can't we be in love without the clutching and gripping"", though later Todd admits to ""not being a very good person"". Howard's character has his ambiguities too, being a university biology lecturer who knowingly has an affair with a married woman. The infidelity gets a funny spin by Rains' business with Germany and Italy pre-WW2, and Rains saying he has ""a taste for intrigue"", though the film being made post-WW2 allows him to speak of the ""Teutonic hysteria"" of the Germans.
In spite of some of Lean's technical touches, the thing that de-passionates the situation is Todd, in her first film for her then husband. Whilst at times she resembles Garbo, the rather butch Todd lacks the divine one's expressiveness, with Lean reduced to filming her running from Howard in slow motion to give her some lyricism. All three of the leads are oddly lit indelicately, perhaps to suggest that all this passage of time has aged them, but this with Todd, adds to the destruction of romantic intent. Lean provides a vocal montage of telephone conversations, cuts from a kiss to a bunch of flowers, doors slamming to a typewriter slide of the divorce document, gives Rains a cuckold paranoid montage, and has a ""Keep Smiling"" poster featured in the background of the climactic scene in the train underground, though the idea of Todd not buying a ticket before she enters rather pre-empts things.
Rains has the audience empathy, even if the odd way he stand in a  pose when he confronts someone seems silly. He is the more emotional of the three, but because of the British standards of polite behaviour, his yells are either heard off-camera or with his back to us. The best scene reads as Hitchcock-influenced with Rains dictating to his secretary and Lean continually cutting to a pair of tickets to a play Todd and Howard go to see. The title First Love gets a comic payoff when we hear it is a musical with a fatuous title song.",1002931200,27,3078,4.731843575418995

574141,1,6303147135,"Spoiler alert: this film tells the tragic tale of a woman who can't be with the man she loves, because she CHOOSES not to be, even though there is no actual impediment. I love old movies, black & white, all of it. (Some of my favorites are Laura, Now Voyager, and Notorious.) This particular film, unfortunately, I found impossible to like. As I've already implied, the story line is my main problem. The heroine, played by Ann Todd, keeps running into the guy (Trevor Howard) she has always loved best, and we're supposed to feel all sorts of suppressed passion and longing during these brief encounters where they gaze and sometimes kiss, because she ""can't"" be with him. Only she can. She CHOSE not to marry him, even though he is gainfully employed as a professor, cooks a mean roasted chicken, and is in her eyes very attractive. Why did she spurn him? Because she doesn't want to ""belong"" to someone the way people in love do, and because she preferred to marry Claude Rains because he doesn't arouse dangerous passions and is richer. Get it? She wants to have her cake and not have it too. So how will things turn out? Will Ann relent and be with Trevor? Will Claude prove to be just as guilty of passion towards Ann as Trevor? It matters not, because her reason for creating this frustrating situation in the first place is so flimsily defined (and hypocritical) as to be empty. The film is beautifully shot, but the casting gives me the queasies. Trevor Howard has a face built for meanness, with that smug little mouth and that cruel bone structure. He can be very effective when playing a dangerous type, but when required to rein all that in and be Mr. Nice Puppy Dog who who has no problem with being led on and disrespected, he becomes strangely disconnected. Ann Todd also fails to move me; her face has an air of entitlement and shallowness -- or maybe that was the character and this is a genius performance by her. Anyway, her character's chosen path is a denial of passion, not what the title suggests. That makes the film dismayingly dull.",1440633600,,2059,4.5675675675675675

The reason why I and other viewers continue to watch the movie is just to see whether she ever gathers her courage or not.  But what also holds my interest is the sumptuous location settings in France and Switzerland.  And Mary's gorgeous wardrobe.  I must admit that I was more sympathetic to Mary's husband Howard - thanks to the superb acting skills of the brilliant Claude Rains.
