8060846,5,B0009HLCZ6,"Given how everyone is worried about mexican immigration across the border these days, this film is very relevent right now in my opinion. It's the story of bad men who are trying to bring illegal chinese immigrants into california and the brave immigration officers who have to stop them, no matter what the cost. The smuggling ring is full of really bad guys, but it all has a happy ending. This is one of those films that really makes you think and shows that the problems we hve today have always been with  us.",1154044800,,514,4.468085106382978

I applaud director Burt Lynwood for having the guts to make this beautiful classic film. And I thought I know everything there is to know about human depravity...""",1146528000,,282,5.0212765957446805
