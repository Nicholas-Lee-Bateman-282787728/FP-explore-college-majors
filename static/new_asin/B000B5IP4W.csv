2399994,5,B000B5IP4W,Outstanding!  Every bit as good as we remember it.  My husband had been eagerly awaiting for this series to be released on DVD; can't wait for additional seasons!,1140480000,12,162,4.75
2399995,5,B000B5IP4W,"Though I had my doubts (as my previous reviews of dicey releases of this series indicate) I am more than pleased the first season of this show has been released. I got it for Christmas and have been thrilled. The stories are strong, the acting and directing phenomenal and the production values acceptable. The list of stars is nearly endless, so chances are you'll see a few you know and like.

I was afraid the release would come with no extras, but I was wrong. A few documentaries make it even better. Realizing that opinions of such short pieces are highly subjective, suffice it to say I enjoyed them.

I like this season in particular because there was a story arc. Nearly every episode's threads were tied up in the season finale. It's no Babylon 5, but at least thinking individuals can appreciate the intricacy they poured into the arc.

All in all, this is one fantastic ride. I don't think it will sell as well as subsequent series because many of these have found their way into previous releases. Also, I think people are reluctant to purchase a single season until a studio shows a commitment to releasing them all. Especially something with as cult a following as The Outer Limits. But take heart and know this: you won't regret buying this. More than that, for those with children too young to have seen the original airings, one day, when they're old enough to watch, they will thank you.

I would be remiss not to give MGM kudos for listening to the show's fan base and releasing the full season. We thank you whole-heartedly and hope you'll continue until the final season is on the shelf.

UPDATE: Okay, it's been nearly two years since this was released. While my sentiment for it remains, my attitude towards those in charge of subsequent releases is markedly different. The concept of releasing seasons is something a five year old can grasp and appreciate. The injustice of being shown seven things and only ever given one is something a three year old can see. Are people in the entertainment industry so out of touch with America and so entrenched in a west coast fantasy world that they cannot grasp these simple ideas? Perhaps the generalization is unfair to some working in entertainment who are grounded in reality. If so, those few who don't fit this characterization, please get a job at MGM in the DVD releases division and show the common sense of a three year old.

UPDATE: Since we're nearing the five year anniversary of this release and it now seems to be sold out, I thought I'd weigh in with another update.  Three years since my last update and my statements above stand strong as a pinnacle of wisdom compared to that of those producing (or more rightly, not producing) these DVDs. I'm assuming that, armed only with the aforementioned intelligence, that those at the helm of DVD releases have now been fired for their incompetency. If so, to you new bloods out there, how about a Season Two release? I mean, Fear Itself - a one season flop that I happen to love - came out on DVD. Shows that were canceled after only a few episodes have wondered into the market. Does it not stand to reason that a show produced for seven seasons would have a fan base that you could tap into? Hint: It does stand to reason. If those in charge have not been fired for incompetency, then I suppose they fit into the masses of bankers, insurance company executives, and Ponzi scheme loving politicians that we employ. Oh, well. Perhaps they've not grown wise through the years. I, on the other hand, have. I now only purchase DVD seasons from companies that are willing to finish what they start with their season releases. It looks like Tales from the Darkside will be next on my list. That show is a good ten years older than The Outer Limits and they'll be completely in DVD before the end of the year. Watch and learn, guys. No one's asking you to build rockets.",1139443200,8,3891,4.581896551724138
2399996,5,B000B5IP4W,"Now that I have season one, plus the box set that is themed (which I got before season one was released, but it filled a void and still does), I'm looking forward to the rest of the seasons (and releasing one a year is NOT acceptable). When the show originally aired on Showtime, only people who received the pay-cable channel could see this great series--uncut and unsanitized. The SciFi Channel took over co-production with MGM in 2001, after the series was cancelled by Showtime in season 7, and the series finally ended in 2002 (for good reason). And if you think the production values and special effects were bad on Showtime, well, the SciFi channel's were even worse (lower quality episodes and more clip shows). They apparently geared their budget to the Stargate franchise.

But compared to most TV shows, pay channel or not, it's somewhat to be expected. The great stories, plots, philosophical questions poised, and vast cadre of stars (who later went on to be even bigger stars), makes you overlook the aluminum dryer ducts on many of the spaceships. Especially when the show was on Showtime.

The great thing about the DVDs is that you get the Showtime version, not the sanitized, syndicated version that most people have seen. Many of the cable-only shows were rated TV-MA for swearing, nudity, violence and stylized gore. A perfect example, ""Flower Child"", can be seen uncut on the DVD ""Sex and Science Fiction"" collection.

This is one of the best TV show remakes in history, so if you feel like treating yourself, or someone else, this is the gift to get. You can literally watch a whole day of episodes and not get bored. Might even remind you to go do your laundry. :)",1134864000,89,1687,4.7312925170068025
2399997,5,B000B5IP4W,"I never really enjoyed it on the air, but this set is sweet. If you like the new Twighlight Zones (especially the 80's ones) or Millenium, even X-files, you will enjoy these.

They are at times dated and even corny, but the stories are there. Actors are sometimes solid people that later explode in the 90's on their debut roles. Plenty of other quality people as well. They did chince on budget here and there, but overall it's worth it for serious collectors.

All we need now is (all) the Amazing Stories on DVD and we're set.",1134000000,6,529,4.443298969072165
2399998,5,B000B5IP4W,"SIMPLY SAID, IT'S THE ""GREATEST"" SHOW OF ALL TIMES. NOW THAT MGM HAS FINALLY PUT OUT SEASON ONE, I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY THE WHOLE COLLECTION ONCE THE OTHER SEVEN SEASONS ARE RELEASED.",1133654400,7,180,4.484848484848484
2399999,5,B000B5IP4W,"I've been waiting for this release for a long time. I can recommend it to every Outer Limits fan, it's worth every penny.

Although, I would have expected more special features.

It also contains proper subtitles (not just closed captioned) English and French and my favourite episode the Conversion with Rebecca De Mornay.

I just hope season 2 is comming soon.",1131667200,12,362,4.901639344262295
2400000,5,B000B5IP4W,"Thanks MGM for finally releasing The Outer Limits on DVD in seasons - starting with season one, instead of only offering collections by various themes.  I was not alone in holding out for DVD by seasons, and refusing to start collecting by the theme collections they are offering.

This is a must have for any serious collector of The Outer Limits!  Many of the episodes from season one I had not seen in quite awhile, and a couple I can't remember at all.

Although there is nothing really spectacular in the format of the DVD menus, or in the special features, I did find the special features informative.  The episodes themselves are what make the collection a good one.

When I used to watch these on TV, I got used to hearing the words ""Please Stand By"" at the end of the opening where it says ""...You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the deepest inner mind to the Outer Limits - Please Stand By.""  - Somehow I still expect to hear that ""Please Stand By"", but it is a small thing, and obviously Standing By is not necessary for very long when watching on DVD :)

It was great to see some of the actors and actresses that played in some of the episodes, such as Leonard Nimoy in I, Robot - And Robert Patrick in Quality of Mercy.  Fans of the Dead Zone, will also recognize Nicole DeBor (Sarah Bannerman on the Dead Zone) from the same episode.  Fans of La Femme Nikita, will recognize Alberta Watson (Madeline) from the episode, ""If these Walls could Talk""

If you are only interested in time travel or in aliens or another single theme, you may be best off getting just that theme, but if you are a fan of The Outer Limits in general, I recommend getting season one of the New Series on DVD.",1131235200,122,1727,4.365625
2400001,5,B000B5IP4W,"After waiting and watching for an eternity...ten years after that first season revived the sci-fi horror genre...after collection and collection of ""the best of"" or ""themed episodes....

...we finally are treated to the entire first season's episodes of the Outer Limits.  At long last.

The first episode I was treated to was one of those ""on stage"" productions (where the sum total of the action takes place on a single set) starring Robert Patrick.  I was hooked.",1128556800,25,466,5.012987012987013

2400011,5,B000B5IP4W,It's a shame they didn't release any of the further seasons past the first one here.  Instead they did the theme packs which is still good but not quite the same.  This is sc-fi awesomeness and worth the money.,1383091200,,210,4.358974358974359

2400014,1,B000B5IP4W,"Need I say more - perhaps there is a need .
I am FED UP - TOTALLY FED UP, WITH THE
REGIONALIZATION OF DVDS AND PLAYERS. In
America you have a complete release of
The Outer Limits on disc. In the UK we
have just Season One. Some person makes
a decision, probably monetary, that beyond
the American shores, on balance, or due
to an imbalanced mind, that certain series,
popular ( perhaps ) in the USA - in the
UK, we are deemed not worthy for the full
release. Could this be that we are too
small a market ? Why, why, why can you
not release the series on Region 0 so we
can all see it. Even UK made series are
released in the USA in full, but in the
UK, even were we to beg on bended knee,
would we get a full release, or in some
cases "" a "" release ? No!! This stupidity
addressed and dealt with. We haven't even
the Amazon Download facility. I saw the
first season of this new series of The
Outer Limits back in the 90s, then some
individual ( or conglomerate ) decided
that there should be a cut-off point.
I have a word for the stuff between
their ears - clag ! It is a worthy word
for such individuals and the stuff between
their ears, I hope you will consider it.
It also goes along with not subtitling
DVDs or ( when subtitled ) subtitling
white lettering, often fine - not bold -
superimposed on a complicated, or even
on a white, - yes, repeat - white ( ! )

2400015,4,B000B5IP4W,"I saw the ""Sandkings"" episode (story by George R.R. Martin) some time in the late 1990s and was thoroughly captivated by it. Starring three generations of the Bridges familyBeau, his father Lloyd (of ""Sea Hunt"" fame), and son Dylanit is endlessly suspenseful and elaborate enough that, even after multiple viewings, the story line still surprises me as it unfolds.

Since that first viewing, I had rented ""Sandkings"" several times on VHS to enjoy again and to share with various friends and family members. I recently went in search of a DVD version of ""Sandkings"" and this was the least expensive way I found to acquire it.

I consider the ""Sandkings"" to be the best episode in the set. Other episodes tend to not hold up well over time as has ""Sandkings,"" but there are some that don't completely disappoint. Most notably, ""I, Robot,"" ""Virtual Future,"" and ""The New Breed"" are good viewing. If I could, I'd give this DVD set 3.5 stars, but will err on the high side, because it is definitely better than just three stars.",1359504000,3,1023,4.741573033707865
2400016,5,B000B5IP4W,"After getting hit or miss showings on Sci-Fi it is finally good to have this set. Though I have the complete seven season Canadian release, this is better in that the episodes are not edited for regular TV showing, but rather the complete unedited episodes aired on Showtime. Also noticed the picture resolution to be somewhat better. In the bar scene on Valerie 25 you can see the liquor permit for the bar business and read the lettering ""City of Vancouver"". Though not BluRay resolution, the upconverting of a BluRay player makes this series look pretty good. I think MGM must have done some tweaking to make the picture quality somewhat better here. BUY IT!",1358035200,5,661,4.756521739130434
2400017,5,B000B5IP4W,Super. This was just what my son-in-law wanted for Christmas.  So glad we could make him happy.  Hope to purchase more in the future.,1357862400,,133,4.5
2400018,5,B000B5IP4W,"The product itself is top-notch. That is, the packaging is minimal, yet safe for the discs, and the menu for the episodes and features is simple, easy to use, and avoids all the stupid gimmicks as though I were a child (i.e. it's a simple list of the episodes, and when you click on your selection, the episode merely begins. No special effects or pretend wormholes to travel through first. This has great value to me). These things alone compelled me to give it five stars.

If I were rating the episodes alone, I might sneak the rating down to a four star. Most of them are pretty good, a few are outstanding, a few verge on silly. But this was a very good buy for me. I love anthology shows, and this one is entertaining. I will likely buy subsequent seasons.",1352592000,,762,4.366197183098592
2400019,5,B000B5IP4W,This the full version of series that was on Showtime a great purchase. It's to bad they didn't finish releasing the rest of the series in the states.

2400020,5,B000B5IP4W,"This is the best season of the series in my opinion, although the series as a whole is excellent. This is a US release so you will not get the bad DVD packaging you get from the Canadian releases. If you like Sci-Fi anthology series then this one is highly recommended.",1321056000,2,269,4.294117647058823
2400021,4,B000B5IP4W,"Just finished watching all the episodes and was not dissapointed. The picture quality was very good and the stories were as good as I remembered them. No damage to any of the dvd's but some editing skips and one had the subtitles stuck on it, so I deducted one star. I just hope we don't have to wait another 10 years for season 2, because I am not a fan of the Canadian edited versions. WAKE UP M.G.M.!!",1315612800,3,404,4.1923076923076925
2400022,5,B000B5IP4W,"Aside from this being one of the greatest T.V. shows I've ever seen, the DVD product here is very well worth buying.  The audio/visual quality is fantastic.  There are special features, such as featurettes and interviews.  Obviously, MGM doesn't know a good thing or have the intelligence to make the rest of the seasons (Season 2 through Season 7).

2400026,3,B000B5IP4W,"This is real Bush era socially conservative moralizing masquerading as science fiction. The over all gist of this first season is that no good can come of science, scientists play god, no good can come of space exploration or contact with other intelligent life, and religion is man's only hope. Real fear based stuff. There are a few notable exceptions like I-Robot. But all in all it's still entertaining, even if it's second rate sci-fi.",1286841600,4,440,4.88
2400027,4,B000B5IP4W,"This is an excellent sci-fi tv series from 1995 which gets even better with season two. The series is reminiscent of ""The Twilight Zone"". A variety of guest actors appear in the various episodes from Leonard Nimoy to Alyssa Milano. Originally only the first season was released in 2005 on DVD, with theme sets completing the collection, so it's great that it appears that each of the seven seasons will now be released individually and at a nice price. At the time of this writing a new season was to come out about every month starting in May, 2010, with season five scheduled to come out in August, 2010. So far Alliance Atlantis is only releasing the new season sets in Canada. Season 3 was released on June 1, 2010.",1276128000,2,719,4.538461538461538
2400028,5,B000B5IP4W,"The Outer Limits is one of the very best anthology television series dedicated to science fiction. One of the fun things about this 1995 upgrade of the older 1960's Outer Limits series is that Joseph Stephano, the creator of the original series was tapped as executive consultant on this new series. So it maintains the flavor of the older series, while adding new stories, sharper and more sophisticated special effects and stage sets.

Another great thing about this series is that a variety of different writers and directors worked on the episodes, giving each episode a unique feel to it.  The episodes of The Outer Limits are a stand-alone anthology.  Each of the episodes is a complete story unique from each other episode, and features some of the very best actors and actresses in the business. The episodes run approximately 1 hour each. The quality of the video is excellent, crystal clear images and color, and perfect audio.

If Amazon does not have this on sale directly, I recommend getting this from one of Amazon's listed alternate sellers.  I recommend a seller that has the ""fulfillment by Amazon"", label.

There's one other thing I'd like to note about the content of this series..., this was not a made-for-television series, it was made for the cable subscription channel Showtime, so it does not hold back on the graphic images of blood and sex.

Below is a list of all the episodes in season one. You will see my comments on most of these in the list.  All of The Outer Limits episodes are excellent and contain the highest quality production values. I recommend the entire series, though it seems only the first season has been released in full. Episodes from other seasons are available in smaller packages.

* The Sand Kings; Mysterious alien insectoid eggs are discovered in soil samples from another planet.  They are carefully being hatched in a government lab to study them. One of the insects escapes triggering a panic that shuts down the project. But the lead scientist lets his ego get the better of him and he steals a soil sample and tries to raise the insects to full adults at home.  A very strange and eerie episode with excellent effects , and  brilliant back-story about family dissolution as the scientist becomes obsessed to the point of neglecting his wife and putting his son in danger.

* Valerie 23;  This is a darker version of ""I Robot"" from the original series.  A young disabled engineer who is working on an artificial skin project, is tapped as a test subject to take home a prototype robot/android named Valerie. Outstanding special effects highlight this one. Things get very much out of control in a frightening way as Valerie tries to adjust to new ""feelings"", especially with regard to her test owner.  There is some fascinating concepts thrown into this one as it explores the parameters of interaction between human and ""artificial"" life forms.

* Blood Brothers;  This starts out with an ""evil corporation versus manipulated scientist"" theme, but surprisingly turns around later when the lines between right and wrong become blurred over what is to be done with a miraculous new drug concocted in a lab.  The drug appears to contain an immune system booster that makes the one who has taken an injection of it immune to all disease and even to the effects of aging.  But it becomes a nightmare when it is later discovered that this drug is not at all the miracle it first appeared to be.

* Second Soul;  There is a twist ending to this one, but it's not what you might expect. This episode leads you in a direction filled with paranoia and panic about a strange alien race of intelligent human-like parasites who come to earth seeking dead bodies to inhabit so that these aliens don't die out, their own planet having become uninhabitable. Interesting dialogue between the aliens and the human director of the project designed to help them..., regarding life... , afterlife and the soul.

* White Light Fever; A very bitter, very wealthy dying old man who is funding a medical project to build an implant to artificially keep a heart beating forever.., faces death many times as heart failure strikes him over and over. The special effects are minimal in this one, but the concepts are great.  An old man fears his death to the point of being willing to sacrifice younger people waiting for heart replacement so that he can keep living.  Doctors argue with each other over whether the old man deserves to get a new heart or not.

* The Choice;  this one is the only episode I was not happy with. Do you remember the movie Carrie?  Well, this is sort of a mini version of that movie but with very strong feminist overtones. A young girl finds she has great mental power that she can project into a physical manifestation by pushing people around or hurting them ( men or boys ), and doesn't know how to control it, until she meets an adult woman who seems to have the same power and she helps the young girl control hers. They are being chased by an evil man who just seems to hate them for having this power, for no other reason, and ..., apparently men can not have this power because it is genetically available only within female chromosomes.  Carrie was better.

* Virtual Future;  A virtual reality body suit and helmet, when ramped up to full throttle, cause visions of the future to appear for the person..., and about the person..., wearing it.  Interesting concepts are debated in this one.  If you know the future..., can you change it?  Perhaps, but what are the consequences?  This one is an ""evil corporation versus manipulated scientist"" theme.

* Corner Of The Eye; A priest despairs of all the poverty and suffering he sees in ""trash town"" an area of the city where derelicts and destitute people huddle against the elements. He is in ""Trash Town"" handing out blankets and food to the people there, when the police raid the area , driving off the inhabitants.  The Priest is knocked down in the panic that ensues and while on the ground catches a glimpse of one of the police officers who..., for a moment... seems to have the face and eyes of a demon.  It turns out there are aliens among us disguised as ordinary people.  They reveal themselves to the Priest and infuse him a strange power that allows him to heal the wounds of any injured person, even bring people back from death.  The Priest finds his faith restored as he goes around healing people, but later learns the terrible cost to the earth that his acceptance of this power, and his covering up the presence of the aliens, is causing as he finds himself to be only a small cog in a much bigger plan.  Great make-up/mask effects in this one.

* Under the Bed;  This one is not typical of the Outer Limits series.  No science fiction in this one, it is a myth-based episode with some very spooky moments as two young children are lured away by a strange evil creature. The manhunt ensues, leading the searchers to an old abandoned mine.

* Living Hell;  this one had a remarkably gripping story.  A drifter.., is shot in the head by a mugger.  The drifter is rushed to the hospital with severe brain injury, and is saved only by the implanting of an experimental computerized neural chip in his brain. The drifter later discovers that his mind and his motor functions, including his vision,  occasionally get taken over by an accidental linking with another person who has had a similar implant.  The big problem?  The guy who he links up with is a serial murderer and the drifter becomes an unwilling participant in the crimes..., at long distance.  An intense thriller..., as he tries to track down the person committing these crimes.

* Dark Matters;  Intense science fiction and supernatural metaphysics combine in this excellent episode about a deep-space freighter that is traveling at light speed and drops out suddenly ... drawn into a pitch black warp anomaly in space where a gigantic chunk of dark-matter is forming the anomaly. It is a limited warp in space that they find they can not escape from, and they find that they are not alone. Is the human soul made of energy?  And if so, could it be trapped in a warp in space forever?  Desperate measures to try to escape, meets up with human and alien ghosts from past trapped vessels invading their ship.

* The Conversion; A hapless real estate broker named Henry who sold bad properties and went to jail, is finally released and plots murderous revenge on his former employer and co-conspirator who didn't get punished.  He intrudes upon a dinner party and shoots several people, then runs... having been shot himself by one of the guards there.  He steals a car and drives till he's out of gas and wanders into a bar, where he meets a very unusual stranger who seems to know everything about him..., and wants to help him.  This is a strangely satisfying story reminiscent of the Christmas classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"" , but the stranger Henry meets in the bar is not an angel.  This is a story about a man getting a second chance, a ""replay"" so to speak, to undo the bad choices he made..,  and it tugs on all the emotions but..., it's very very good.

* Quality of Mercy; This is a futuristic war story taking place in an alien's prisoner-of-war camp on another world. The Alien planet and Earth are at war.  A human fighter pilot Major Stokes is shot down and captured, and is thrown into a dungeon-like holding cell with another human, a woman who was a cadet in training when she was captured. This is an intense psychological thriller.  The only food to eat is strange live crustaceous bug-like animals tossed into the holding cell once a day, and all the while.., the screams of other captured humans who are being tortured permeates the cell. The Major notices that the young female cadet has a skin graft that looks like the skin of the aliens. She tells him , they are trying to change her into one of them. Which seems to be true as they drag her off several times, each time returning her to the cell looking more and more like one of the native aliens. This is a story about deception and misplaced trust.  The aliens who have captured the Major turn out to be far more cunning and clever than he imagined, and they are determined to win the war against earth.

* Caught in the Act; This episode is a cross between Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and Alien.  A very reticent young college girl ,Hannah,  who is very very beautiful, wants only to engage in foreplay and necking with her boyfriend and will not go any further, insisting that they get married before she commits fully.  Needless to say, this leaves her boyfriend frustrated, but he's determined to wait it out, because he loves her. Up to that point, the episode appears to be just standard romantic melodrama.  Then everything changes. A small bullet-shaped meteor crashes through the roof of her house and lodges into the hardwood of her bedroom floor. Hannah is in bed at the time and is startled by the event. She crouches down to examine the strange meteor and something like a large luminescent spider jumps out from inside and clings to her face. It slowly absorbs itself into her body, where it takes on a parasitic symbiotic relationship, driving her to lose all her inhibitions.  The big problem, is that this alien creature eats anyone who makes love to Hannah.  There are some seriously top-notch special effects in this one. But if you're very squeamish about blood and guts, you may want to skip over this episode.

* The New Breed; A young scientist designs an amazing new medical nanorobot technology, microscopic robots that can be injected into the bloodstream to repair damaged organs, or change cancerous cells into healthy ones, even prevent diseases and viruses, but..., it's untested on humans, and has yet to be tested on animals. The scientist's friend is diagnosed with a cancerous mass in his back, but when he learns about the technology of the nanorobots, he decides to break into the lab and inject himself with the nanobots. Initially , this turns out to be a cure for his cancer, and the nanobots seem to be protecting him from any and all physical harm internally. But, having thousands of tiny robots roaming around in his body turns out to be not such a great thing. The nanobots begin to overdo things, and the results are horrifying.

* The Voyage Home; This is another variation on ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""The Thing"". A Mars exploration team has landed and is deep in  a cavern on Mars where they discover what appears to be a form of language carved into the stone.  Beside the carving is a very large ovular object. They try to move it and it spits out a gas-like substance.  When they get back to their space ship , they discover a mold growing inside the ship, which they presume came from the object in the cavern. The mold turns out to be far more than just a fungus.  From there, it's a fairly predictable plot. The tension is ramped up when there are only two crew members left, and one of them isn't human any more.

* The Message; This is an elegant and sophisticated science fiction story about a very beautiful deaf woman who has a cochlear implant that did not work as it was hoped, to help restore some of her hearing.  Her doctor upon looking at x-rays has determined that it is not functioning and never will.  But..., the woman insists that she is hearing something, strange voices, speaking in a language she does not understand.  Unlike some of the other episodes in the series, this one does not end with a dire warning or disturbing lesson, but ends on a hopeful and uplifting message.

* I, Robot;  This is a remake of the ""I, Robot"" episode from the original 1960's Outer Limits series. This time Leonard Nimoy is the retired lawyer who comes out of retirement for one last great court battle, to defend a robot against the charge of murder. This is better than the original episode, Nimoy carries it all the way with a great performance.

* If These walls Could Talk; A guy and girl, maybe in their late teens, decide to spend the night in what can only be described as a classic haunted house.  Perhaps they felt it was the only place they could be alone together.  The dilapidated old victorian era home with its creaking floorboards, drafts, and mysterious sounds begins to disturb the guy, he decides to make sure no one else is there.  He disappears around a corner and screams.  That's the last we see of him ( ...sort of..), the girl goes looking for him, she meets a similar fate.  Was some lunatic hiding in there?  Was it evil spirits? No. A more interesting discovery is made as to the cause of their disappearence, and it's extraterrestrial in nature. This one is a clever mix of horror and science fiction.

* Birthright; A senator is involved in a car accident in which he suffers a concussion.  In the hospital, a startled doctor looking at his skull x-ray, sees what appears to be two extra brain lobes that humans should not have and organs in the body scan that she could not identify. The Senator's security team suddenly enters the hospital room, grabs the x-rays, and whisks the Senator off to a hidden location.  He does not understand what's happening, but he's about to discover that he is part of a conspiracy that runs very deep. This episode is actually a very clever twist on a standard alien invasion plot.  Particularly the manner in which they go about using the US political system to manipulate the public into accepting a devious scheme involving changing the environment.

Both of these make it a keeper even if you didn't care for the original. The rest of them uphold the tradition of OL legend.  I hope that season two is available at a lower price. I can see myself collecting all six or so seasons of this show.  It was much better than Paramounts re-boot of the Twilight Zone a few years back.

It took me a number of episodes when it aired to get into it. Liking Sci-Fi as I do, I was willing to let it find itself. And for the most part, if you stop seeing this as an updated version and begin to allow it to be what it is, the ideas offered, though a bit preachy and biased in some story lines, are well presented and worthwhile in their own right.

I own this, so that should tell you. However, after the third or fourth season, the show began to get pretty lax in their diligence to strive for excellence, having fewer and fewer compelling stories to tell. Oh well. So go for the first few seasons and leave the rest to the dust bin.",1227052800,4,907,4.267441860465116

If it was worth bringing out the rest of the series, it was worth bringing them out the way they were originally aired on Showtime.  I vote with my money and you are not getting any more of mine until you give me the remaining seasons in an UNCUT format.

I snatched up this excellent follow on rendition of outer limits as soon as I found it in October of 2005 and I'm still waiting for season 2 and all the other excellent seasons.

I've had to resort to watching this excellent anthology on my digital cable channel (Showtime), but I would very much like to have all the rest of the episodes for all seasons of this show on DVD.

To who it may concern...if you want my money, then let's get it together and put the remaining seasons of this fabulous show on DVD!",1197072000,9,1037,4.304123711340206

I enjoy science fiction, but I need a little mystery, melodrama, something inspiring that keeps my attention. The Outer Limits seriously lacks those things. The only episode that is definetely worthwhile is Conversion, because it has a nice lesson, about everything being interconnected. Overall, I do not recommend, 1 star.",1183248000,2,484,5.217948717948718
2400040,5,B000B5IP4W,"Okay, the picture is beautiful, sound is great. As I've said in other reviews, I don't have surround sound or a plasma TV / large screen, but I'm sure the picture quality will be fine there too. I was quite happy with it.

The season is complete, more than complete actually. It has good bonus features.

HOWEVER! PARENTAL WARNING:

NOT MENTIONED READILY IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION OR ON THE BOX (OR OTHER AMAZON REVIEWS) IS THE FACT THAT THIS WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED ON SHOWTIME, AND THIS IS THE ""FULL VERSION"" INCLUDING THE OCCASIONAL (IN SOME CASES FULL-FRONTAL) NUDITY AND LOVE/SEX SCENES AS ORIGINALLY AIRED ON SHOWTIME.

So, if you only saw this one WB, Fox, UPN or other ""broadcast"" network, be aware that the cable version was slightly more risque. There are several episodes with ""Showtime Moments"" of semi-gratuitous nudity. Fine for adults, but you may wish to keep a couple of the episodes away from the kids, or else definitely ""parentally supervise"" viewing. Definitely pre-view all episodes before allowing minors access, if unsure.

Just figured I'd throw that out there. I'm an adult, and not opposed to nudity or sexual situations. It just took me by surprise, since I'd only seen the ""broadcast"" version, and the unapologetic nudity was a slighty shock (there really wasn't much if any warning on the package aside from an ""unrated"" stamp in the fine print on the lower corner of the back of the box). Though it was generally tastefully done... There were at least a few scenes that were a bit on the borderline ""graphic"" side.

That said, it was truly a great series, both for sci-fi enthusiasts and for pushing some social and technical/film-making boundaries, and I look forward to the rest of the ""season"" compilations being released (as opposed to the thematic compilations).

Truly a must have for anyone who love the series or good sci-fi. With the above parental warning in mind... ;o]",1165708800,18,1909,4.8734567901234565
2400041,5,B000B5IP4W,"I personally think this was one of the 3 best series that was out in the late 1990s and one of the BEST sci-fi series ever. I had bought 2 of the ""themed discs"" when I heard that the seasonal box sets were finally going to be released. I bought Season One the day it was released but.....like many others...have been left hanging by the completely clueless pencil necks that control this stuff!!! At first I thought maybe Season One didn't sell well enough for the greedy bastigians to release the rest but, judging from this and other websites, there is PLENTY of interest out there. And considering some of the crap they ARE releasing on DVD...?!?!?!?
It is very unusual indeed when the greedy pencil necks in Hollywood pass up an opportunity to make some money!!

Bottom line: GREAT SHOW, one of my all time favorites and I would LOVE to be able to replace my recorded VHS tapes with DVDs but doesn't look like that will be possible unless MGM pulls their heads out!!!

An edit: I finally gave up on any subsequent releases and bought used copies of the rest of the ""themed"" DVDs. Glad I did, one of them actually had an episode I'd never seen!!! Though I wish they were in 5.1 like the season One box!!",1165190400,15,1206,4.427927927927928
2400042,4,B000B5IP4W,"Following in the footsteps of Tales of Tomorrow, the original The Outer Limits was a landmark show.  Many years later a creative team decided to resurrect the feel of the show and this is the result.  As pointed out in one of the many extras, this is not The Twilight Zone.  That show relied heavily on fantasy while this one would be grounded in science.

Aliens are a favorite in this season as is man's need to tinker with the universe.  We even get a robot.  Some of the stories are based on classic science fiction like Sandkings (George R.R. Martin) and I, Robot (Eando Binder).  Others are fresh and new.  I was a big fan of the original series and have fully enjoyed this new one.  At its heart, this is the same series.

There are several superficial differences between the old series and the new.  The new series is in color.  The new series includes harsher language.  The new series even include nudity up to full-frontal.  The new series can take advantage of slicker special effects.  But all of these things are minor.  Both series use quality actors and writers.  It is the intelligent stories that make the series and not the window dressing.  A great series that should be seen by all science fiction fans.

This season includes the following episodes:

Sandkings

Valerie 23

Blood Brothers

The Second Soul

White Light Fever

The Choice

Virtual Future

Living Hell

Corner of the Eye

Under the Bed

Dark Matters

I think when I have kids, I will want to use Outer Limits as a teaching tool to cover many topics of morality.  Fair warning there is nudity in an occasional episode.

Fortunately at the time I was getting Showtime to see Stargate. You can imagine how happy I was getting two great SciFi shows before they were commercialized on regular networks. Needless to say I am very happy with the great skill that went into remaking Outer Limits. The writing, acting, costumes, sets, special effects, music, and everything else are extremely professional. One thing I do want to mention is although you are anxious to get these, don't forget most series after they come out over a few years they finally make one complete series set which is often more compact and cheaper. Based on that I went ahead and got me the theme set to get me by until the complete series comes out as a set.",1156204800,4,867,4.425

Before Showtime resurrected and updated this series, most of us horror nuts were limited to stupid, low budget ""made for tv"" garbage on the Sci-Fi channel.  So when the Outer Limits arrived out of nowhere in 95, it was an eye-popping experience.  The gratuitous violence and nudity were a bit shocking, but I appreciated the fact that the producers were really trying to push the bar for what a sci-fi series could be, and give viewers the impression that they were actually sitting in the theater watching a movie and not just a television show.

Needless to say, the Outer Limits quickly turned into one of my favorite series, and I was disappointed when Showtime decided to end it's magnificent run in 2000.

This DVD box set is really a treat, though the extras are a bit scarce.  Hey, who cares?  At least we're getting the entire first season, completely uncut and commercial free... and that's all I could ask for.  Great show and great package!",1154995200,4,1143,4.71356783919598

2400051,3,B000B5IP4W,"Yes, the series was excellent, and I'm not going to try to improve upon the comments of other reviewers. My concern here is that I bought a copy of the discs from a local Meijer store only to realize a few days later that the package contained 2 duplicate sets of Discs 3-4. Upon trying to return it a few days after that, I learned that that particular store, along with all the other dozen or so stores in the area, had returned their copies to the vendor! After trying to contact Sony Pictures Home Entertainment for weeks until finally they responded that they were not set up to exchange defective discs or packages, I was finally able to locate 3 copies at a Meijer store about 60 miles away. Lo and behold, upon inspecting their copies after all that travel, I found out that TWO OF THEM HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS MY ORIGINAL!! So in the end I was lucky, getting the final copy at any Meijer store within about a 100 mile radius (and possibly also including other dept. stores like Walmart and Target, as I have seen no copies at any of those stores I've visited), but I wonder if anyone else had similar problems and was left out in the cold by Sony. My ultimate point here is that if you consider buying this set, check it RIGHT AWAY for duplicate discs and return it quickly if there is a problem!
