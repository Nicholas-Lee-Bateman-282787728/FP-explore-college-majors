4371697,4,B004FZWDQA,"It's nice when there are several sci-fi movies in one package. Each one has its own DVD so you can always choose the one you enjoyed the best and not have to look at them all. That is a good advantage. If you don't take the movie too seriously, you can really enjoy it. Its meant to be entertaining and it is. Happy viewing!",1329523200,4,324,4.078125

8428442,3,B004FZWDQA,A real mixed bag with this set Hive was ok really good/bad CGI I would rather watch the old 1950's version of this but I can't remember what it was called it was a much better film than this one.  Vipers was actually pretty good over the top but a decent movie.  Then there is Gargoyles this one was better than Hive and worse than Vipers so it kind of balanced the set.  All the movies are watchable but if I was going to rewatch it I would skip Hive.,1496534400,,452,4.0

8428446,5,B004FZWDQA,"Rise of the Gargoyles is the better of these three movies.  Nothing wrong with any of the others, but one just rises a little over the others.",1378080000,3,142,4.2592592592592595
8428447,3,B004FZWDQA,"Three decent B SciFi movies.  I recommend this set.

The Hive:  A mountain of millions of flesh-eating army ants in the jungle of Brazil eat everything in its path. Horace Lennart, a scientist from Thorax Industries is called in because of his experience and ground-breaking equipment that can exterminate them.  He brings along his girlfriend, an entomologist Claire Dubois. At first the ants show no capability of reason, but then a cave is discovered and they are far smarter than suspected.

Vipers: During a break in at a laboratory, genetically enhanced super vipers are freed. They are big, they bite, they devour people, and they reproduce at a rapid rate. Worst of all they outnumber inhabitants of a remote island.  The inhabitants barricade themselves in at a hotel. Their supplies and ammo are running low.  Can they survive till relieve comes?

Rise of the Gargoyles: A professor visiting Paris is researching gargoyles and finds that they disappear off an ancient catherdral.  Worse yet people are found torn to pieces the next day.  The police are suspicious of him and don't believe his stories.  Can they be true?  He must determine what causes them to rise and if they can be stopped.

Under $10 this is a good value.  More than that and it is not.  These are decent because of stories, acting, directing, sets, and music.  The picture and sound quality are good too.  If you enjoy B SyFy movies you will probably enjoy these.",1370822400,5,1444,4.828571428571428
