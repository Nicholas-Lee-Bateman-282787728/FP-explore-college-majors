7908245,5,B00000FE0I,"""Try this for a deep dark secret. There great detective Remington Steele, he doesn't exist! I invented him. Follow. I always loved excitement so I studied, and apprenticed, and put my name on an office. But absolutely nobody knocked down on my door. A female private investigator seemed so... feminine. So I invented a superior. A decidedly masculine superior. Suddenly there were cases around the block! It was working like a charm. Until the day he walked in. With his blue eyes and mysterious past. And before I knew it, he assumed Remington Steele's identity. Now I do the work and he takes the bows. It's a dangerous way to live, but as long as people buy it, I can get the job done. We never mix business with pleasure. Well... almost never. I don't even know his real name!""
This is how some of the episodes began, with this introduction by 'Remington Steele's' assistant, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist). Now you know the whole story behind Remington Steele. The Remington Steele series were about the cases Remington Steele (Pierce Brosnan) and his associate Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) cracked many difficult and complicated cases. Also starring were James Read as Murphy Michaels as their co-worker (only in the first season), Janet DeMay as Bernice Foxe their secretary (only for the first season), and Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs (for the rest of the seasons). I thought that Murphy Michaels and Bernice Foxe were pretty necessary in the series and was sorry to them go after the first season, though Mildred is a great character! Showing occasionally was also Stephanie Zimbalist's father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Daniel Chalmers, an old friend of 'Remington Steele'.
After the mysterious 'dark haired and blue-eyed man' (Pierce Brosnan) assumed the identity of Laura's non-existent Remington Steele, Laura and Murphy are making sure he does not get involved in any of their investigations. But when Laura cuts off Remington's bank account after his excessive use of money, he decides to get 'personally involved' Laura's investigations. Unfortunately when Remington's fail-proof burglar system for a document they're supposed to protect, Steele Investigations faces a heavy lawsuit. And when Remington's good friend gets mysteriously killed, it's up to them to find the real burglar and murderer. * I just simply LOVE this episode! Pierce Brosnan is just perfect as Remington Steele: sophisticated, charming, handsome, mysterious, etc., etc. He has some pretty cool blue-tinted glasses in this episode. And the chemistry and sparks between Remington Steele and Laura Holt is immensely fun to watch. Laura just can't seem to stand him but at the same time is attracted to him. We also get to see a short scene from the movie, ""The Thin Man"" (Warner Brothers, 1934, William Powell and Myrna Loy.) and plus, Remington Steele and his associates get to act out the scene!",1013817600,,2889,5.09704641350211
