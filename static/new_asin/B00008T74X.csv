Well, many years have passed and there have been several funny movies.  This one was mentioned in the NYT obit of Ms. DeCarlo, whom I remember from that time as ""the most beautiful actress in the world,"" and who reappeared on Broadway singing ""I'm Sill Here.""  Let's get this back on the market.  Please!",1168473600,11,445,4.444444444444445
8170514,5,B00008T74X,"This is a dated, but hilarious movie. It takes place in a little Irish village whose claim to fame is being the ancestral home of O'Leary, a 17th century Irish hero. Full of blarney, brogue and atmosphere, the story opens as the existing O'Leary squire, aged 82, dies after taking a tumble from his horse. In his will, he has left the estate and the debts of the village to a distant relative who ""has lived most of his life in England.""

The story takes off as the new squire, admirably played by David Niven, begins to bleed the small village dry. Fed up with their new lot, the villages vow to take dramatic action.

Amid anger, commedy and ghosts, the story moves along well. It is great fun and certainly family entertainment. I would like to see it available on DVD.",1134086400,11,772,4.429577464788732
