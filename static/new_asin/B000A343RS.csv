8073648,3,B000A343RS,"""Out of Season"" would be a true and very good film noir had it not be badly edited. Nonetheless, it has all the requisite elements - a young innocent who gets drawn into the complex web of shady characters who inhabit a seaside resort off season where it's well known that ""everybody goes a little crazy out of season."" The film has two femme fatales, double and triple crosses, vexing coincidences with tragic effects, and a sufficient number of night rainy scenes to make even the German expressionists happy. It's also shot on a lean budget and has the look and feel of the 1950s B films that made film noir so popular.

The film stars Jordan Frieda as the young drifter who gets ensnared in a web with bar keeper Dennis Hopper, cheating wife Gina Gershon, cuckoled husband Jim Carter, wacko religious thief David Murray, and seemingly sweet Dominique Swain.

Hopper (1936-2010), of course, is a film icon. The young Dennis Hopper is best known from his ""Easy Rider"" (1969) film and life style, but in fact he had a fairly distinguished film career prior to 1969 with good (if minor) contributions to films like ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955), ""Giant"" (1956), ""Gunfight at OK Corral"" (1957), ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965) and ""Hang `em High"" (1968). Post ""Easy Rider"" he gave us magnificent performances in films like ""Hoosiers"" (1986) - for which he received his second Oscar nomination - ""Blue Velvet"" (1986), ""The Last Days of Frankie the Fly"" (1996), and my favorite Hopper performance in ""True Romance"" (1993). Unfortunately Hopper is not always 100% in this films. He has his moments when he [puts in a great scene, and then there are other times when he seems to be phoning it in. Overall it's a decent performance, but could have been so much better.

Gina Gershon is the only other well known person in the cast, and unfortunately she seems to sleep through her juicy role as the adulterous and murderous femme fatale.

This was the last film for the film's star, Jordan Frieda. He was best known for playing Prince William in the TV movie of the same name (2002).

Jim Carter's name may not be well known but he's been in over 100 films and TV movies. He's best known for playing Oliver Cromwell in the TV movie of the same name (2003).

Cute Dominique Swain is best known from the 1997 version of ""Lolita"" and as Nicholas Cage's daughter in ""Face Off"" (1997) in which Gina Gershon also appeared.

The film was written and directed by Jevon O'Neill. This was his second and last outing in either capacity.

I gave this film a rating of 3. Some aspects are truly worthy of a 5 rating, but the editing really interferes with the film. True film noir afficienados should take a look and think about what might have been.",1295136000,,2733,4.6206185567010305
8073649,2,B000A343RS,"I was hoping for a good thriller, but this DVD was hardly watchable. First of all, it takes forever to get going and then of goes nowhere. Really, the story is lame and it seems like those who wrote the story were constantly changing their ideas as they went along. Anyway, it was tough ever getting through such an uninspired movie. Therefore, don't waste your time on this one!",1210636800,2,379,4.507246376811594
8073650,4,B000A343RS,"Double crosses, betrayal, jealous, greed and double moral join forces in this sinister and well made thriller where there is an interesting personage, a sort of unlucky gangster, living in shame due a tragic fact (Denis Hopper is perfect in this role).

This modern Noir but smartly adapted in those times where the dense brume of the memories and the fatality hover on this lonely city, where the roller coaster is the main attraction of this attractions park; curious and emblematic metaphor, because all the taken decisions must be done against time. This perspective is brilliant and original.

On the other hand, the script works out as a huge watch mechanism; the edition process and the narrative rhythm is a real pleasure to see.

A film that, fortunately, surpassed all my previous expectations. It would be advisable to many producers to take into account this promissory director.",1152230400,4,891,5.0476190476190474
