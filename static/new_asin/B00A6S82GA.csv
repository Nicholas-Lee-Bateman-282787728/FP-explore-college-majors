8547080,5,B00A6S82GA,"People diagnosed with dementia and their caregivers are often faced with the decision about getting or not getting aaid from Emergency Services.  There is so much inaccurate information that even compassionate ER workers do harm without even knowing it.  In this video, Teepa educates emergency personnel so that they can better assist families and patients in crisis.  As always, Teepa does not just teach to only one group of people. She passes on essential information to all about this dreaded and horrific syndrome of all dementias.  This video should be mandatory education for all entering into any type of emergency care services and is equally informative and interesting to the public.",1392854400,2,695,5.2342342342342345
