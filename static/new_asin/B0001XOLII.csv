2042918,5,B0001XOLII,"Unlike the other amityvilles horror movies, this one takes place in a completely different town. The evil from the house is transferred into a lamp, which is given to a family of a deceased father, and the evil begins when the little girl in the family is haunted by her fathers spirit in the lamp. The film has some gory parts, like when some guy puts his hand in a sink garbage disposal, and the switch turns itself on, and blood goes evrywhere. I totally reccommend this film to Amytiville Horror fans.",1085875200,12,505,4.5

2042929,5,B0001XOLII,"Was very happy to receive the movie in what seemed like in a record time. Very good movie, scary for a made for tv movie. had a good plot for a 80s made movie. LOVED IT.",1401062400,,169,3.7222222222222223
2042930,3,B0001XOLII,"Most of the Amityville sequels, like the Howling sequels, should be avoided if you value your sanity. However, this one was actually pretty decent. Yes, it's cheesy as hell and most of the cast stinks to high heaven. It's really a crappy made movie and the plot is pretty ridiculous. The effects left much to be desired. And of course it's about....an EVIL LAMP!! That being said, it has some strange addictive qualities and remains a guilty pleasure of mine.

 We begin with the blessing of the previous house, where Father Kibbler comes face to face with an evil looking lamp in the place. When blessing the premises, a spirit goes through the power cord of the device, treating the viewer to a cheesy glimpse of a 'demon head', before the good father is knocked on his ass and unconscious. Soon after there is a garage sale where Helen Royce purchases the ugly thing as a gag gift for her sister. (Weird family traditions are about as creepy as this film). The poor soul slices her finger on the appliance, but never seems concerned about the wound even when it pusses, swells, and looks like it's nearly gangrene. She mails it off (The Evil lamp, not her finger, although the latter would have made a more entertaining gift).

The package arrives at the uptight sisters home, coincidentally on the day Nancy Evans and her three children come back after the tragic death of their husband/father. The young girl seems to have an odd obsession with the horrible looking lamp; the undertones of what will eventually happen is painfully obvious.

 When Nancy and her children arrive all sorts of wild things start happening, albeit a little slow at first. We have the generic B-horror scares such as the lamp turning on by itself when no one's looking, the same mistakes King's new version of The Shining makes. This never scares the audience (I HOPE!!!) and only succeeds into further condemning the film into the box labeled ""Less scary than moldy cheesecake.""

 Some of the ways to build tension or ignite fright are laughable. So the little girl's room is in shambles? Electrical problems throughout? Add a nice dosage of tension between mother and daughter, and then grandmother and grandkids, and you have a plot that has been seen millions of times but can still satisfy the horror-heart on some pokey, reminiscent level.

Patty Duke is the main star Nancy. I always loved this gal. I used to watch her Patty Duke show when I was a teenager and ended up catching some of her lifetime made dribble. This is the second horror I have seen her in; the other was lifetime dribble too, but good haunted house dribble. There's a difference you know. In this case she's the mother of three. The grandmother pulls her weight in a mediocre way, but is still interesting to watch.

  The little girl has you wanting to slap her rather than fear her (when the movie wants you to). The other two are also low on the acting totem pole. The rest of the cast consists of a housekeeper, an electrician and his son, and a plumber (have to fix those mysterious problems ya know). Come to think of it, none of them can act that well. But has that ever stopped us from having our ""guilty pleasures"" before? The lamp is ugly as sin. Some gothic sort with weird wires almost looking like arms coming out of it. It's stored conveniently in the attic and of course has the youngest child in it's evil schemes. Again, she doesn't come off as wholly convincing.

 It's interesting to watch just to see what happens. The first viewing I wondered what their reactions would be when they discovered the truth (super grandma anyone?) and what they would do about it. Yes, this one isn't really that good in its' own right but it still keeps you glued to the screen. Perhaps some subliminal messages in there causing this? :) Ooohhhhh...",1379635200,,3811,4.644873699851412

2042932,5,B0001XOLII,"Amityville 4:The Evil Escapes is a chilling film about the devil, evil, and posession. Patty Duke is superb as always as a mother trying to protect her family. There are several gruesome parts that probably make this a B film, but it is enjoyable. Made in 1989 it is tame by todays standards, as it is not a gorefest.",1374192000,,317,4.389830508474576
2042933,3,B0001XOLII,"Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes is a made for TV fictional movie that tells the story of items from the Amityville house that were sold off to people at an estate sale.  One of those items, a lamp, contains the the demonic evil and tries to take over a family. I did find the movie to drag a bit, since it was made for TV, but did enjoy it.  If you can find this film for a bargain price, I would not hesitate to pick it up!

Reading comments from other reviewers there seems to be thinking that the producers of this movie just came up with this ridiculous idea of a possessed lamp. That is not entirely true. This movie is based on the book ""Amityville: The Evil Escapes from John G. Jones. The plot from the book:

""When the Lutzes fled 112 Ocean Ave they left all their personal belonings behind. To get rid of the extra items a yard sale is held at the house. All the items are at bargain prices and too good to pass up. Little do the buyers know...they are getting more than they bargained for.""

The movies that follow this, Amityville Dollhouse, Amityville: Its About Time, all are based on the same book. It would of been a smarter idea to combine all the movies that follow into one movie as this would make more sense to follow the book more closely.",1373068800,,1260,4.233333333333333
2042934,5,B0001XOLII,"Yes this one is great as the same as the others, Not over done and all the stories are different which makes it stand out better. Fabulous storyline and the actors bring you into the movie keeping the suspense with you until the very end. Moving house visiting Grandma all the excitement you would want, Now this movie isn't a real bad horror, but still full on entertainment involved with this classic. So I rated this an A grade movie worth looking at and judging for yourself. So pick up your movie and gather the popcorn  get comfortable for a fantastic night in with your feet up.",1371340800,,585,4.4672897196261685

2042940,1,B0001XOLII,"I can picture the pitch now. After 1 hugely successful film, 1 moderate sequel, and 1 horrendously bad sequel, the series goes on about a 5 year hiatus. Then, someone has an idea for a 4th film that is so inspiring, it borders on genius. He gets a meeting and fires into his sales pitch, nearly blowing the room away. It begins like this... OK, forget that the house blew up at the end of the third film. We begin with a whole mess of priests that come to the infamous Amityville Horror house to once and for all exorcise the entities within. Now, fearing that they may be forced back to Hell, which for obvious reasons, is bad, so they don't want to go. Now, since all life is electrical in nature, it makes sense that in order to survive, the entity becomes pure electricity. Having nowhere to escape, it enters the 1 thing still plugged in. Are you ready for this.....A LAMP!!!!!! Now the room must have been dead silence in awe of this idea. So, the priests have a yard sale. Never mind that they don't actually own the items for sale here, the audience won't care. Someone buys the now haunted lamp and sends it to a relative 3000 miles away. Bad things ensue. That's it, whaddaya think?? They respond, AWESOME!!!, Better than the first, here's a million bucks, go make it. That would actually make a better movie.",1284508800,8,1319,4.432098765432099
2042941,5,B0001XOLII,tis is the only good amityville movie after the frist three thats any good. patty duke a very good actress..  the movie would have been better if the whole story was about the house not a lamp. still a good ghost story flim.this seams to be were the amityville movies start to be  boring and have nothing to do with the house in amityville...,1270857600,,342,4.328125

2042943,3,B0001XOLII,"Finally after a move to T.V. and a lower budget, they caught the creepy feel of the book and put a few chills into this one. Without the fx's to fall back on they went for the ""thing's unseen"" approach and it did the film all the better for it. Now the bad news, this is a one time only film, as all the others would use the fx's approach and laps into silly jokes.",1186444800,,365,3.88
2042944,4,B0001XOLII,"In 1989, after a six-year hiatus, a fourth Amityville came our way. This fourth installment is entitled, AMITYVILLE 4: THE EVIL ESCAPES. Grant it that this also was not the greatest in the franchise, but it was a whole lot better than that of AMITYVILLE III: THE DEMON (aka AMITYVILLE 3-D). As it would turn out, this was the first of the Amityville films to be a straight-to-video release. From this sequel down to the eighth Amityville installment were all straight-to-video releases.

  This film starts off with a whole slew of priests entering the Amityville house (continuity was not an option to the producers, writers, and directors on this film, for the house was originally blown up in the third film), trying to rid the house of its evil spirits. All the evil is then transported into a hideous looking lamp. When all the chaos stops, the priests seem to be satisfied. The next morning a yard sale is held in front of the sinister house. A harmless old lady sees the lamp in the selection and decides to buy it as a gift for her sister, ALICE LEACOCK (played by Jane Wyatt). As she looks at the lamp, she accidentally cuts her finger on it, but goes on ahead with her decision to buy the lamp.

  That afternoon, the woman who bought the lamp ships off the lamp to her sister, but her finger is looking terrible. But she dismisses it. Flash from New York to California, a woman named NANCY EVANS (played by Patty Duke), and her three children: AMANDA (played by Zoe Trilling), BRIAN (played by Aron Eisenberg), and JESSICA (played by Brandy Gold) are driving to Nancy's mother's house, where they'll be staying for awhile, since Nancy's husband (the children's father) had sadly passed on. Nancy's mother is...Alice Leacock. Her sister would be Nancy's aunt, and the children's grand-aunt. The arrive at her house at the same time the lamp arrives. But as Alice plugs in the lamp, everything begins going chaotic. For instance, Alice burns her hand on the tea kettle. No one turned up the stove, but an unseen force has. The next morning, Alice's parakeet suddenly dies. And Jessica seems to not be feeling well. Later on, it is found out that Alice's sister, who shipped the lamp over to Alice, had died from that cut on her finger. That's exactly would happen when you cut yourself on something, and not bother getting a tetnis shot.

  Over the course of the next few days, everything goes from bad to worse, as the plumbing decides to become a little funky. The plumber comes out to fix it. As he tries to fix it, his hand gets lopped off by the garbage disposal. The toilet and sinks begin oozing something black and gooey. Nancy cannot take this no more. She decides it's time to get help from FATHER KIBBLER (played by Fredric Lehne). He climbs onboard to help the family out. He accompanies Alice and Nancy to their house, where they discover that all the evil from the lamp is controlling Jessic. With the help of Father Kibbler, they put the evil to rest.

  This film, as I had stated, was not the greatest in the franchise, but it was better than AMITYVILLE III: THE DEMON (aka AMITYVILLE 3-D). There were quite a few moments that scared me, but the whole film could have been a lot scarier.",1154390400,,3214,4.5898778359511345
2042945,3,B0001XOLII,"It's hard to imagine that the Amityville name could continue on to a venerable future after the horrifyingly bad Amityville 3, but after a 5 year hiatus, that's exactly what happens in Amityville: the Evil Escapes. Taking the evil out of the house that took the windows are the eyes of a house to new terrifying heights was certainly no small task, but the moviemakers did their best to make the story work in spite of the lack of the original house. Some decent scares are present, and the acting is much better in this outing than in Amityville 3, but ultimately, it's difficult to imagine an Amityville without that infamous house. More potential for the affect that this could be a real occurrence would have been the key to this movie paralelling the original, but it still is a watchable Amityville feast if you don't expect too much.",1128729600,,840,4.644295302013423
2042946,4,B0001XOLII,"I had second thoughts of buying this when i picked up the box set, and im glad i did this is a great horror film, a good part 4.",1120608000,2,128,3.4482758620689653
2042947,3,B0001XOLII,"After three theatrically released entries into the haunted house franchise, and after a six year hiatous, the series returns but this time debuting on the small screen. Yes, Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes was made for television. I generally am not big on made-for-TV movies, but Amityville 4 isn't too shabby. It definitly lacks the production values that were present in the first three films, but it is still watchable.

The film opens with a rag-tag group of priests storming the alleged Amityville house (Even though the house got destroyed at the end of Amityville 3-D, but somehow I don't think continuity was on the filmmakers minds) in an attempt to drive the evil out. The evil actually retreated into a horrid looking lamp. The lamp is bought by a unknown purchaser and the horror begins.

I think the biggest downfall was that the movie doesn't take place in the popular huanted house. Like the subtitle says....the evil escapes. This idea would also affect all the sequels to come. The Amityville Curse has possessed furniture, Amityville 1992 has a possessed clock, Amitvyille [7]: A New Generation had a possessed mirror, and Amityville [8]: Dollhouse had a possessed...uhh...dollhouse. If you can accept the idea of the Amityville evil being able to escape in various objects then Amityville 4 might be watchable for you.

The DVD itself also isn't anything to get excited about. Full screen with ok picture quality. It was released with two seperate DVD covers, but neither of them are very good.

Even though the DVD or the movie itself are nothing to get too excited about, you can usually find this movie real cheap which makes it worth picking up. This DVD would be perfect purchase to go along with MGM's Box set the includes the first three films in the series. Now only if we could get Amityville 5 on DVD as well...",1117411200,5,1840,4.813291139240507
2042948,5,B0001XOLII,"Amityville 4 the evil escapes is the best one out of all the movies (even if it was a tv movie).  The acting was great, the story was better than the first one, and the lamp is just straight creepy!  I remember watching it as a kid when I was 9, and I couldn't remember which Amityville it was that had the lamp in it.  About a week ago, I was in a retail store and finally found it for $7.99!  I would have to say it's one of my favorite horror movies (even if there wasn't that much gore).  If you are curious about Amityville movies, then you should watch Amityville 4 The Evil Escapes, but you should also watch the first one before it just to get the storyline.  I highly recommend this movie to late eighties horror fans!",1090368000,17,727,4.120567375886525
