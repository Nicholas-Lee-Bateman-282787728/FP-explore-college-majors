1903032,5,B0000A5A1J,"We have been watching Tiny Planets for some time on the Latin American feed for Direct TV, but the videos were only previously available in the UK (PAL) format, and not NTSC.
I am so glad that these shows are now available, because they are simply entertaining and educational.  Without saying a word, Bing and Bong take you on discovery adventures to the Tiny Planets, each one teaching something different - light, colour, sound, nature - lots of science.  You can clearly understand what's going on through the helpful interpreter, Halley, and the concepts are easy and well presented.
Each episode is short, and therefore not a problem for kids with short attention spans, and there are eight episodes in the video, so there's a lot of learning fun to be had.
Great for pre-K's and up",1074124800,9,788,4.744525547445256
1903033,5,B0000A5A1J,"I've never seen my 2 year old hold his attention for so long. It teaches simple science at a level that many young kids will understand.
I look forward to any more Tiny Planet DVDs to be released.",1073001600,2,196,4.184210526315789
1903064,3,B0000A5A1J,"This is a cute movie, but you should know that Bing & Bong don't talk and there is a narrator...my daughter lost interest quickly.  Probably suitable for 4 and older, but the attention span of anyone younger is probably minimal.  Still cute :)",1305244800,,243,4.627906976744186
1903065,1,B0000A5A1J,"My comment has nothing to do with tiny planets. I ordered this DVD not knowing that is registered for an area in America. So i think it's better that it is not sold outside the USA. The only problem is that i haven't found a sight in Europe which also sells this DVD.

So now only watching the box itself is the only solution.

1903066,5,B0000A5A1J,"My kids first saw a preview of this show in the extra disc that came with the Sid the Science Kid. They watched it over and over again. So I saw this one and bought it for them and they love it. Recommended for any age. Mine are 2, 4, and 5. I even enjoy watching it with them.",1278633600,6,277,3.711864406779661
1903067,5,B0000A5A1J,"My kids (2 & 5) both love it! I only wish there was more Bing and Bong out there for the purchase because its hard to find this show on TV. And as a graduate of CLUB KID UNIVERSITY myself, I love the funky tribal back beats. Just bought one for my friend who's having a baby!",1239321600,4,275,3.8421052631578947
1903068,5,B0000A5A1J,"This show is ADORABLE.  The characters are so cute that you just want to squeeze them.  (At least that's what my 4 yr old says).  Bing and Bong go on all sorts of adventures, traveling to different planets where they explore and learn all sorts of good things, like numbers, shapes, sounds, colors, etc.  The program is really entertaining, funny, and did I mention cute!? :)  Definitely pick it up if you've got a preschooler in your life!",1238630400,4,440,4.589743589743589
1903069,5,B0000A5A1J,"All the TINY PLANET'S BING & BONG stories are wonderful, entertaining, and educational.  There are no spoken ""languages"", so all toddlers on up can enjoy each story and fall in love with the two main characters, easily...not to mention--their parents, too!  The graphics, music, and action are all top-notch.",1153612800,,308,5.26530612244898
1903070,5,B0000A5A1J,I love this series. I was so pleased to find this on DVD. My son watches this all the time and he learns many things. I am looking forward to the next DVD. I would recommend this to any parent who has children of pre-school age.,1151884800,,228,3.9782608695652173
1903071,5,B0000A5A1J,"This is one of the most fantastic shows ever made for the toddler and pre-school crowd.  Educational, hilarious, and entertaining.  My daughter (now 3) has been watching these two furry critters since she was a year old.  I only wish there were more than just the 2 DVDs...",1147392000,,273,4.645833333333333
1903072,5,B0000A5A1J,"Bing and Bong figure things out in an educational and fun way.
Unlike many cartoons, the physics in here is much like
the real world.  Our whole family enjoys Bing and Bong.
I highly recommend it.",1084665600,4,196,4.444444444444445
1903073,5,B0000A5A1J,"I never thought that there is an animation in the whole world that could attract my little one. Do you know why? ... because my doughter is 7 months old . She wasn't just attracted by tiny planets , but she literally froze while watching it and didn't allow anything to distract her.
If your a housewife who cannot do houswork and take care of her baby at the same time(wich is the case with all housewives), Tiny Planets is your savior.",1079308800,4,437,4.341463414634147

7995997,5,B0000A5A1J,"My child cannot stop watching this over and over. All the stories are child appropriate and free of foul words. The intro music is addicting even to me. In short, if your child is into Bing & Bong, then get this DVD, as they are kids once in their life and this DVD really appeals to kids imagination of exploration and curiosity.",1458950400,,330,4.338709677419355

7995999,1,B0000A5A1J,My big kids were very excited to know I ordered this show to show my little kids. To sum it up the DVD didn't work! I tried on new and old DVD players. I guess I just got had!,1397174400,,175,3.5128205128205128
7996000,5,B0000A5A1J,My son loves this DVD - I would recommend this - I wish they were still making new shows.  I would recommend this to a potential buyer.,1396483200,,135,4.0
7996001,5,B0000A5A1J,"Delvery and ordering was simple and fast, delivered in good time.
DVD was Region 1 and my DVD was Region 2, so had to type in a 5 digit code to make it multi regional.
Only thing is that instead of the UK voice for the narrator it now has aquired an american one!
All together great supplier. Will probably buy the other Bing and Bong DVD, if I can find the 60, as they
are rare!",1387324800,,379,3.935064935064935

7996004,5,B0000A5A1J,"I searched hard to find these DVD's since I had only a few episodes on my DVR, because every one of my five kids, ages 2 to 13 would stop what they were doing and watch this show.  The characters are cute and fun, and the kids actually pick up a lot of basic learning skills from watching it.",1354060800,,292,3.9491525423728815
7996005,4,B0000A5A1J,"We love Bing Bong Bell - but, be careful, this video is the exact same one as  ""Explore and Discover with Bing & Bong"". I don't know why but if you check the episodes it is.",1311897600,,173,3.8055555555555554
