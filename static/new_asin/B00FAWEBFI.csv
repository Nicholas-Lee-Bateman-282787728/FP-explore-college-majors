8613926,5,B00FAWEBFI,"To make a film out of worldwide aclaimed  Albert Cohen's novel ""Belle du Seigneur"" is an imposible mission. No wonder the rights for the film were acquired a long time ago and nobody had the courage to take it to the screen until Glenio Bonder , a young, sensitive and seriously ill director ( he died shortly before the film was completed) did it. The book is part of a set of 4  describing the saga of a Jewish family, the Solal's in the years prior to the second World War.
Albert Cohen, was himself a  Catholic Jewish born in Greece but he became  a Swiss
citizen and he wrote his novels in French.
Belle du Seigneur tells the story of a successful and high rank  Jewish civil servant of the League of Nations, in Geneva : he is rich, handsome ,single and has a beautiful mistress. But everything changes for him when he falls desperately in love with a married  Christian woman, a beautiful aristocrat named Ariane. This happens in the
1930s in the early stages of Germany's antisemitism.
Solal , compasionate and proud of his Jewish roots, fights  to help his people through his position in the League of Nations  but fails to do so. This causes him to resign and to seek refuge in the love of Ariane.
Ariane hates her husband, a pretentious and stupid Solal's employee. She is a dreamer who lives in her own world and she is inmediately seduced by Solal's charming personality, wealth and good looks.  She decides to leave her husband which results in her being banned from  the social status she enjoyed.
Both lovers seek refuge in their mutual love,  triying to reinvent themselves everyday to avoid boredom , desperately fighting  to  keep their passion alive in this claustrophobic world of their own,  until the ultimate and tragic consequences.
All this complicated psychological drama is written in the first person, that is,  each
character unveils his or her own thoughts to the reader and it is impossible to pour all its contents in a  film so, to really enjoy and understand it,  it would be necessary to first read the book.",1416700800,2,2044,4.617728531855955

This is not a happy ""feel good"" movie, and I also did not follow some of what was going on so I ordered the book.....which is over 900 pages.  I skimmed most of it, but read the parts that I recognized from the movie.  The movie made a lot more sense after ""sort of"" reading the book.  So either read the book first and then watch the movie, or watch the movie and then read the book......... but add it to your collection if you are a fan of Mr. Rhys Meyers.",1407715200,3,516,3.839622641509434
