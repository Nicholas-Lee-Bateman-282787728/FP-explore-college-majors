7973866,4,B0000714CN,"I very much enjoyed this interesting and very experimental French film. It follows Thomas who is agoraphobic and hasn't been outside or let anyone in his apartment for eight years. The entire movie is shown from the perspective of Thomas and his futuristic video phone conversations... in fact we never actually see what the main character even looks like. This film is quite an odd mix of dark comedy, romance and sci-fi. It's set in a futuristic society and even though we never see how far in the future it is... it seems pretty far down the road based on some things in the film like cyber-sex suits which Thomas uses to have simulated sex without actually interacting with the other person face to face.

This is a hard movie to describe, and the more I think about it the more I think you just have to rent it to see what it's like. It's a great commentary on how our society is evolving technologically, all disguised in a dark romantic twist. I think its worth a shot for all you experimental movie fans out there. 3.75/5 stars.",1294358400,,1036,4.51063829787234
7973867,5,B0000714CN,"A slight, upbeat review of a slight and upbeat little film which in it's breezy yet heartfelt tone could only have come out of France... no wait, it's Belgian! Who knew!

Five stars for absolute originality, a refreshing treatment of guilt free, cheery eroticism and a delightfully scorching virtual sex opening that makes me think about taking some computer programming and graphics classes. If this is the future of sex, bring it on and hurry up!

Frothy, inconsequential, lighter than air, silly and an absolute joy. Like finding a plate of ice cold sliced pineapple in your fridge on a hot and humid day. Don't miss it, a real winner!",1222992000,,638,4.790909090909091
7973868,4,B0000714CN,"The shtick of the film is a series of conversations Thomas has through his visophone (a futuristic version of live chat with a webcam). He speaks with his mother who calls to often, a number of women through the dating service, the prostitute, his therapist, and his insurance agent who assists in making sure Thomas never has to leave, or allow anyone into his home. Through these conversations we get to know the way Thomas interacts, but we never see Thomas.
 Aesthetically, Thomas In Love is beautiful. Each conversation that takes place is engaging. However, that doesn't stop a raging debate over shooting the entire film in first person. We don't see Thomas in the end, although our instincts tell us we might get that chance, we the viewer, are him. He talks, he grunts, he moans, and we put on a cyber-suit with him, but we don't see his face. This may aggravate some, others find it complements the film and can imagine it no other way.
 There are very few other films done in the first person style, perhaps for good reason, as in most movies it would alienate the viewer from the character. Movie audiences prefer to have the information about the story given to them, at least the main details - the main character is an important detail that audiences feel lost without.
 However, Thomas In Love succeeds where most stories would fail, because of the unique situation of the story. Because Thomas interacts with the word through his visophone, which presents other people to him very much as a television screen does, the story doesn't feel lost without seeing a main character. This unique style is also assisted by the fact that Thomas does not leave his home for any reason, or communicate with anyone other than through the visophone. It is entirely feasible that Thomas never sees his own face, nor would he have any cause to, since his world is so tightly controlled it would be of his own volition.
  While some viewers are not going to be able to put aside the use of first person, and enjoy the movie for the story. In a sense, first person is a valuable storytelling device for this particular plot, in another sense, it a device to alienate less adventurous viewers. What cannot be argued is that if first person is a legitimate device, this story does not suffer for it, but is enriched.",1066089600,2,2313,4.645476772616137
7973869,4,B0000714CN,"This is the future, and we are seeing through the eyes of Thomas Thomas, an agoraphobic who has not left his apartment for 8 years. Not only that, but no one can come into his apartment as well. The only people he interacts with, are those who call him by visaphone, a telephone where Thomas can see someone and vice versa. His mother calls him too much, his vacuum cleaner keeps breaking down, and his psychologist signed him up for a dating service, Catch a Heart.
This dating service tends to work at first. He meets a quirky, cute girl, Melody. His insurance also gets him involved with a service that has medical prostitutes, to help with his needs. Will he let someone come into his life and his apartment? Or, is he doomed forever to stay alone and in love?
I liked the way that everything was very visually attractive. There are lots of bright colors in the apartments, 3D photos, and people wear strange plastic vests and what look like henna tatoos on their face or head. One woman had strands of hair stuck to her face shaped in an artistic way. It's a love story with some science fiction thrown in. We never see Thomas's face, only hear his voice, and we see what he sees. I thought that it was a very original concept, even if the story was not. Finding love can be hard, when you don't want anyone to touch you. I think that the best part about it was his very familiar computer generated cybersex pal. She has contrived new storylines every week, so it's as if it's an interactive adult video. She's the epitome of what most men seem to want, Lara Croft type who doesn't say no. Those parts were very amusing.
Watch it, though it may be harder to find than your local Blockbuster.",1064707200,2,1696,4.404458598726115
