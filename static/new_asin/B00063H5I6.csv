I guess he is it for a few seconds, but they put his face on the cover to sell copies once he got famous.  I  doubt it will ever get released on DVD.  Surprised he hasn't bought up all the copies and destroyed it yet.",1402704000,,305,3.8548387096774195
8037877,1,B00063H5I6,"This movie was made as a very cheap knock-off of Field of Dreams (starring Kevin Costner).  I remember renting this movie as a kid, thinking that it had to be awesome because Kevin Costner was in it.  The cover (as you can see) displays a big ol' picture of Kevin Costner.  When my brother and I watched the movie (back in '86), we both had to laugh at the acting.  Gavin was one of the worst actors I'd ever seen in my life.  The plot was lame, and the budget must have been less than 20 dollars, and I don't recall ever seeing Kevin Costner in the film.  We've joked about how horrid the movie was until this day.  I was actually thinking about it again the other day, and I decided to buy a copy and send it to my brother.  Hopefully he doesn't disown me.  Just kidding.  It's just one of those movies that you get finished watching and say, ""Man, that was the stupidest movie I've ever seen.""  Kind of like Napolean Dynamite.  The funny thing is, it's so stupid that you find yourself thinking about it later and laughing about how bad it was.  I think I might actually like to watch it again.  It would definitely be comedic.",1253664000,3,1130,4.244131455399061
8037878,1,B00063H5I6,"I buy all of Kevin's movies, so this one was a must buy, seeing as he is on the cover. I watched it, he is on two scenes MAX. They just have him on a cover to help sell the movie. I barely remember anything from this movie, so unless you're a fan of the kid in the movie, I wouldn't get it for Kevin Costner.",1228262400,2,308,3.6818181818181817
