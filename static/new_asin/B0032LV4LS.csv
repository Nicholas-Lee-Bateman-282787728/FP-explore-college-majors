4061970,5,B0032LV4LS,"This is good history lesson for all Americans on the continent before Columbus who came and conquered.  It was wonderful that native Americans made a great civilization in temples, pyramids and monuments for us to admire and understand.

Native Americans shared their corn, pepper, pumpkin,squash,tomato and potato to feed the hunger.  However, they faced an unhappy outcome after one hundred years of contact.  It is not until recently, scholars are able to decode Maya codes as books were burnt and code knowledgeable priests were killed.

4061972,3,B0032LV4LS,"Pluses: The computer generated imagery is interesting, and cinematography is excellent.

Minuses: Rather slow moving, and as other reviewers have said, geared to a jr high level.  And, I'm afraid, rather patently anti-European.  Columbus' crew are ""desperados"".  And we're told about how smallpox is passed to the Indians via infected objects, while a European man gives a little Indian girl... a crucifix.  (Yep, those devious Europeans wiped out the gentle natives with smallpox-infested crucifixes.)

The video's production quality is excellent, with beautiful photography and a competent but introductory-level story line. Most people who have read some history won't find anything new here, since the information is presented at about a junior-high-school level.

For five years Columbus had requested $ backing. He finally got it as there was not much to lose. Guys on his crew had nothing to do as they were former warriors.

Meanwhile, in The New World natives took care of a land or resources. There were some developed people groups. Features what the first encounter may have been like. From there everything changed. Europe wanted all the resources the new lands had to provide. People who had nothing came in hopes of getting something for nothing. They brought with them ailments that caused death to the locals so everything was for the taking.

4062005,1,B0032LV4LS,"This video is taken verbatim from the book ""America Before Columbus"" by Matt Green (Google it). The impromptu interviews during the video are not impromptu at all, but merely quote the book, and sometimes add a few extra words to make it more interesting. In some cases, the narrator makes exact opposite statements than what is in the book by leaving out a word or two. For example, at 27:30, the video states, ""Their rivers are NOT used for power, and are not affected by farming."" The book, on the other hand, says, ""Their rivers are used for power, and are not affected by farming."" The book is based on unproven hypothesis, challenged by many historians, that Native Americans were plentiful, intentionally burning land to increase the size of the plains in order to attract bison, etc. There are spelling errors throughout, and it makes statements without any basis of fact or citing references, which the video simply repeats as fact. It claims there were over 100 million people in America, but modern historians have stated the number to be closer to 40 million, of which only 3 million lived in North America. The majority of this documentary is fiction masquerading as fact. Christian Europeans = bad. Native Americans = good.",1454803200,2,1237,4.867298578199052

I am not questioning or debating the content of the documentary and the visuals are quite stunning. However this was not what I was expecting when I got this from the library - I was hoping to learn historical accounts of the first people, and there was almost none of that.

4062050,5,B0032LV4LS,"This documentary is a very well done piece of work.  It not only provides much
basic factual information, which is readily available elsewhere, but more importantly
puts it into an intelligible and thought-provoking context.  Watching this should
cause a wellspring of curiosity and ""wow, I never thought of that, or thought of
some basic facts I knew in that way at all""  sense of wonder in those who truly
delight in being able to see things in a new way or new light.
  Although basically neutral in its point of view, the documentary is able to
present the inevitable negative consequences of the sudden meeting of 2
different types of humans who represented levels of cultural and scientific
development far more seperated by eons of time than by the few thousand
miles of seawater that lay between them.  You really should be able to sense
the inevibility of tragic consequnces from the coming into contact of people who
in addition to be the genetic ancestors of the vast majority of those living in the
Western Hemisphere today, were even 500+ years ago much more like us today
than they were the unfortunately-primitive 'native americans' of both continents.
And while no disrespect is meant to the aforementioned, it becomes clear to
anyone who sees the reality of what happened with unbiased eyes and an open
mind, to see that Columbus and crew found folks whose level of cultural develop-
ment was between 5 to 10 thousand years behind the Europeans.
  The lack of the usual obligatory political correctness ad nauseum about how
the big bad, hyper -evil  white people wiped out and deliberately-exterminated
the wholesome ""real"" discoverers of North&South America is refreshing, while
in no way minimizing the immense lossof human life that ensued from 1492 on.
Best of all, this documentary provides one with a true sense of wonder of what
it must have been like for people equipped with even the rudimentary knowledge
of the 15-16th. century to wonder across vast undiscovered lands without having
to endlessly carp and bemoan about ""who was here first"" and assign blame.
  I would heartedly-reccoment this work to be utilized by any forward-looking
teacher at the 8th grade of high school level in world history courses, who has
more interest in teaching students what really happened than in beating up and
trying to develop a sense of endless shame and remorse over it.  Enjoy.",1377734400,4,2394,4.942643391521197

4062052,2,B0032LV4LS,"Both the title and the description lead me to believe that most of the 90 minutes of this program would be devoted to the Pre-Columbian Americas. The reality is that the majority of this show is about Europeans and how they changed the Americas to resemble Europe. Only the first 30 minutes holds any discussion of the Americas before European contact, and even then the topic holds equal air time with discussion of pre-contact Europe. After that, the focus shifts almost entirely to the European perspective, most of it about American AFTER Columbus. In fact, other than a brief mention of the Spanish conquest, there isn't even any discussion of conflicts between Native Americans and European settlers - natives just conveniently disappear from the narrative once the focus shifts to Jamestown and the first settlers of the future US. In fact, phrases such as, ""Forests seeming to belong to no one"" and ""empty pristine wilderness"" and so on are used repeatedly. Not only that, but even though most of the changes brought about by Europeans discussed in this show revolve around over-exploitation of natural resources, it's all told to a backdrop of heroic music and a narrator who sounds like he has a smile on his face. It just struck me as a bit odd that the real topic discussed most in this program is the exhausting of natural resources, whether in Europe or the Americas, yet it wasn't even told as if there might be any lesson to learn from this.

I would have appreciated this documentary more if it wasn't for the misleading title and description, but given that it almost seems offensive how much it is centered on the European perspective, almost as if the message is that nothing worth talking about for 90 minutes happened in the Americas until Europeans got here. As a Pre-Columbian history buff, I know that isn't the case, making this documentary disappointing to say the least.",1365206400,40,1898,4.84

As other reviewers have pointed out the video quality is excellent and it focuses on the Columbian Exchange.  For example, I appreciate the more in depth look at simple foods such as potatoes and corn.  They were highly engineered for their day.
I'll use select portions of this video as it is overall a grade or two lower than what I need.  The story line is good, but I'm going to focus on select tribes' intelligent management of their landscapes.  I think we tend to pass over just how advanced their techniques were.  I'm sure the younger kids will enjoy the full presentation.
I would not really call it a critique, but if you have ""climate change doesn't exist"" kids this video might ruffle some feathers.  There is an overriding reverence for the American landscape (it's Nat Geo so what else would you expect), and direct comparisons between the European deforestation and exploitation of their landscape.  The antecedents and consequences of European actions are logically explained, and this leads to some modern day direct comparisons such as over fishing.
Overall, excellent and I'll actually shell out the $$$ for this.",1326585600,3,1229,4.875
4062065,5,B0032LV4LS,"I am a teacher of 4th through 6th graders and this movie - about 90 minutes long - held everyone's interest throughout.  It is really about the Columbian exchange, but it brings up the broader issues of the exchanges that happen when two places explore and trade with each other.  Was the Columbian exchange good, bad, a bit of both? Is the exchange inevitable? Can we prevent invasive (non-native) species from coming into our waters and land? Can anyone?
One of the most important ideas the video so aptly makes is that the North America that Europeans settled in was a continent that looked very different than it would have if they had come 300 years earlier, before the Columbian Exchange had bee in full swing for 300 years. Imagine them finding a large population of settled, farming native peoples - would history have been different?
An interesting point in the movie that I hadn't really considered before was the one-sidedness of the Columbian Exchange.  Why are horses running wild in the American West and dandelions sprouting in every American lawn, but bison don't roam Europe and our native wildflowers haven't taken over Europe's roadsides? The movie gave me a more in depth look at the Columbian Exchange.
If you are considering it for a school setting or younger than 12, there is a thirty second mention of syphilis about 70 minutes in.  Other than that, no worries.
