3913927,5,B002DY9KRU,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this DVD, and when I noticed some of the cartoons actually (almost) filling my HDTV screen, I was impressed.

The DVD includes the following cartoons in 4:3 (or 1.33) aspect ratio:

Cat Napping
The Flying Cat
The Two Mouseketeers
Smitten Kitten
Baby Butch
Designs on Jerry
Pecos Pest
The Night Before Christmas
The Bowling Alley-Cat
Fine Feathered Friend
Puttin' on the Dog

And, amazingly, the following cartoons are presented in CinemaScope (2.55:1):

Touche, Pussy Cat!
The Flying Sorceress
Blue Cat Blues

The cartoons were all released between 1941 and 1956, which I like. (This means, of course, senseless violence, guns and cigarettes.) I'm not a fan of 1960s cartoons; they just don't feel right to me.

The menu system is a little annoying, as you can't just skip to the next chapter; you're taken back to the main menu (although it does set you up to watch the next episode just by pressing Play or OK). Some of the source prints are in better shape than others, but overall this is a nice collection, well presented.",1275868800,17,1072,4.798913043478261

3913935,4,B002DY9KRU,"These are the real thing, pre-1960s, much better than the rip-offs in the bargain bins at Walmart.  There are repeats from other Tom and Jerry collections, however.",1355443200,,164,5.074074074074074
3913936,5,B002DY9KRU,I have built quite a library of DVD cartoons to eventually go to my grandson. Tom & Jerry is one of his favorite set of characters. I really enjoy hearing the little guy laugh so intensely. I also enjoy them.,1352160000,,208,4.225
3913937,5,B002DY9KRU,"As a kid in the late 40s and early 50s, I used to just love going to the movies. I'd go about once a week. Of course, we didn't have TV then, and an adult ticket only cost $.50. If you had a dime left over, you could get a box of popcorn or a soda drink. Movie theaters were popular places and were almost always crowded. A lot of times, ushers would have to show you where the available seats were. A complete theater performance almost always had Previews of Coming Attractions, the News of the Week, an Extra Short Feature, the Main Feature and, of course, a Cartoon. Everybody loved the cartoons and you'd never see a movie without one.

Well, last week when I was shopping the bargain DVD shelves, I found ""Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases, Volume 3."" I had to have it, not only for me but for my little 3 1/2-year-old boy. He likes watching the characters, but the humor is a little too advanced for him at this time. When he tires of it I'll put it away and bring it back several years later. I'm sure he'll get just as much of a kick out of these things as I did as a kid. This type of humor just doesn't age and the cartoons are exceptionally well done and well transferred to the DVD format. Both the art and the sound came out quite good. The 14 different cartoons are somewhat variable in appearance because they represent some stuff from the early 40s ranging to some that are on the wide-screen format. No problem. They all come across well. Just relax and enjoy. I love watching these things and a slight smile is almost always on my face when I do so. Not only are they nicely done cartoons, but they bring back fond memories.
