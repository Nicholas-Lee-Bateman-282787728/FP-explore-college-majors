2476189,3,B000E0ODKY,"The episodes are spotty. Some are quite funny; others are strained. Often the laugh-track drowns out the dialogue that follows. The quality is kind of iffy, too. Some episodes are quite clear, but others have noisy or muffled sound. The acting, on the other hand, is usually delightful. I have seen sets of the complete, two-season series, but this was enough to remind me of what the show was like. (I did like it a lot as a kid.)",1407110400,,431,4.468354430379747

2476215,5,B000E0ODKY,"The ""Adventures of Topper"" was a 50's T.V. Classic that was rerun during my childhood in the 60's.  The fun and entertainment that this show offered kept me clued to the television every weekday afternoon that it was on.  A great combination of slapstick, physical comedy and a touch of vaudeville, it was a classy show with a very high class cast.  One of the truly great examples of early television and a show for anyone of any age.",1372809600,,435,4.481012658227848
2476216,3,B000E0ODKY,"I only saw one episode of ""The Adventures of Topper"" television series back in the days when it was being broadcast and remembered the premise of the series but few of the particulars of the story. I had noticed  that among people my own age, give or take a year or two, ""Topper"" was a very fondly remembered series whenever the subject of television programs of the 1950s would come up. My wife is among those who remembered watching ""Topper"" fondly, so when I saw that Amazon was offering what was apparently a sampler collection of ""The Adventures of Topper"" at a dirt cheap price, I ordered the DVD figured that at the very worst, I'd only be out a few dollars. Well, the bad news is that I've basically wasted a few dollars. ""Topper"" may have been a wonderfully entertaining program for elementary school children in its day but it has aged badly, so badly that my wife's high nostalgic feelings for the series were crushed after watching a single episode. We watched two episodes and simply didn't like them. The storyline were lame and predictable, the humor was forced and the jokes were tired; watching three episodes was tough sledding so we put the DVD back in its case and filed it away. I watched another episode early yesterday morning, thinking maybe the series would be better viewed in the tradition of Saturday Morning Television, and found it was still tough sledding. My advice to those who have never seen the series and have a mild curiosity about it is to move on because there isn't anything to see. There probably are Topper devotees who not only remember the series fondly but will be able to enjoy it in the spirit of past good times, and I wish more power to them, but for those who are looking for whimsical and amusing comedies featuring ghosts, I recommend the two Topper movies instead.",1372550400,,1818,4.611111111111111
2476217,5,B000E0ODKY,who doesn't love topper he is funny and just a great charictor.  and his ghost palls are great in they way they act together as a whole.,1371772800,,136,4.037037037037037

2476219,4,B000E0ODKY,"Topper, for me an all time favorite, for the most part the picture is good but the audio is not. One episode the audio cuts in and out, a couple are OK and 2 have muffled sound. For the price if you like Topper you can beat these 9 episodes.",1370822400,,241,3.84

2476223,5,B000E0ODKY,This was one of the best shows on early television and it should make a come back. They don't make clean family entertainment like this any more. It rates higher then the 5 stars they allow on this site.,1364947200,,203,4.230769230769231

Contains quality video of the old shows and even some commercials too. Somehow I have yet to see a ""Repeat"" from my memory of the show as well so given that I was prepared to see many episodes I had seen earlier when it ran on television it was a good thing in my opinion, I have not completed viewing this DVD at this time however I am sure I will be happy with all I view on this DVD.",1337385600,3,592,4.381818181818182

2476233,2,B000E0ODKY,"For $3.99, one can't complain. The video is good but the audio is truly terrible. Why on earth would Platinum disc brag between episodes that they produced this? I would think they would hide their logo.",1329782400,6,203,4.666666666666667
2476234,4,B000E0ODKY,"I ordered this DVD only because the price was right and it's claim to featuring nine TOPPER episodes. I am glad I did. I have always been a fan of the show, and I always loved the theme music and the actors Leo G. Carroll and Anne Jeffreys. (Anne Jeffreys, by the way, is still alive and kicking as of this writing and is still as beautiful as ever)! The quality of the transfers is quite good, given their age, almost the likes of which you would expect to see on late night retro TV. This brand of television is a relic. It is a vestige of a time when laughs were simple and not political. When people were polite to one another. When humourous situations evolved around embarrassed missteps and social faux pas, not private parts.

I think the show TOPPER is rather charming and quite refreshing given the dubious nature of tele sitcoms these days.  A real fun family entertainment. And I really enjoy the fact that these episodes will play one after the other, without having to resort back to the main menu and start over again.

Two criticisms, if I may.  First. PLATINUM DISC LLC should have kept the original CAMEL cigarette commercials in place as a social commentary of sorts. I have seen them in other collections and they are absolutely hysterical! Leo G. Carroll et al light up with glazed eyes as if addicts in an opium den. In another, actor John Wayne takes time from the set to boast he was a CAMEL smoker for twenty years (much good it did him). NOTE: These commercials are NOT INCLUDED in this set.

Second, lose the PLATINUM DISC LLC logo that flashes every so often on the lower right hand corner. Yes, we know you produced the disc, but leave us to enjoy it without your advertisement, please.

Overall, a nice collection. A fantasy show that delivers laughs from a bygone age of golden television comedy. And I just love that mellow theme song! One last thing, and I bet you didn't know this. Anne Jeffreys and Robert Sterling (the two ghosts) were man and wife when this series filmed. No wonder they had such chemistry together!",1310083200,18,2053,4.505376344086022

2476236,2,B000E0ODKY,This video only has partial episodes not the full episodes.  Maybe if I could see what was going on I could have followed it better but they jumped from one partial episode to the next without any breaks.  Very confusing and disappointing.,1299542400,13,239,4.666666666666667

2476241,4,B000E0ODKY,This was always a fun series for me as a young person.  Topper was so prim and proper and that starchiness was always tested by the invisible friends he had.  I enjoy watching this again after so many years.,1291075200,2,207,4.282051282051282

2476243,3,B000E0ODKY,"MANUFACTURE: DVD arrived with factory seal intact. Surprisingly, there were miniscule scuffs and major fingerprints on this ""new"" disc. Playlist is only accessible from DVD menu. Back cover describes FEATURES as ""digitally remastered,"" which is a given when copying analog tape or 16mm broadcast film to DVD. A faint PLATINUM DISC watermark appears at times in screen's lower right corner.

EPISODES: All nine are from Season One. Most have muffled audio and only OK picture quality. ""George's Old Flame"" and ""Henrietta Sells the House"" are above average exceptions. Their title sequence is a plug for the sitcom's cigarette sponsor (Topper, George and Marion light up Camels). ""A Ghostly Joke"" is misidentified as ""Sweepstakes.""

While I appreciate seeing one of my favorite 50s sitcoms, I feel like the dog who has been thrown a bone.  Although the DVD clearly says digitally remastered, I have gotten better quality sound and video on VHS tapes that I recorded from channels featuring the golden years of TV.  I may be wrong but with the exception of I love Lucy the Honeymooners, and Leave it to Beaver, there has been no attempt to catalog other 50s TV by season together with truly cleaning up the sound and video.  If they can do it for Lucy, why can't they do it for Topper, Ozzie and Harriet, My Little Margie, Oh Susanna, The Charlie Farrell Show, the Adventures of Hiram Holliday, I Married Joan, the People's Choice and Our Miss Brooks.  Every single episode of Lucy has been released by year and the sound and video is excellent.  There are certainly episodes I have seen of Topper within the last ten years that were not included and the quality was much better.  Hope better news is coming.

In spite of that its definitely worth getting the Adventures of Topper,  because the comedy could not be better.  This includes acting writing and directing.  You do not get them this good any more.",1265587200,23,1365,5.159090909090909
2476246,4,B000E0ODKY,"This is a wonderful collection of nine classic episodes from a series that is unmatched by today's slop on TV. For $3.99, the price can't be beat. Echo Bridge has a HUGE catalog of Classic TV and classic western. This was another great find to add to my collection. The only (small) drawback is a light watermark logo on the screen, but it's hardly noticeeable.",1264464000,40,361,4.569230769230769
2476247,1,B000E0ODKY,"The reason that I purchase DVDs of old shows at Amazon.com, aside from the obvious fact that current television is pure garbage, is because the networks have driven me away with their annoying logos and text on the screen and their self promoting and distracting promos flashing on and off during programming.  So I have cancelled my cable and I will spend that money buying DVDs here.  Watching DVDs of the old shows before television went so far south is so refreshing.  No loud, state controlled, politically correct commercials and no intrusive graphics on the screen, just full screen enjoyment as television was intended to be.  Anyway, the company that produced this ""Topper"" video apparently feels that they cannot allow the viewer to enjoy the programs without their self promoting logo flashing on the screen.  The customer does not care who manufactured the DVD and their logos on the screen will not make the customer more likely to buy their product in the future.  In fact, the opposite is true.  You would think they would have enough sense to realize this. So this is my first and last purchase of their products.",1264032000,54,1129,4.848958333333333

Wish I'd've bought Volume 1--- when there WAS one. The other volumes
from other manufacturers are more expensive, and only have 4 episodes.
Since this series is from the early '50s, don't expect perfection.",1516147200,,283,5.604651162790698

The quality is not as sharp as the movies out today, but for the age of the series, I still enjoyed watching them.  Brings back a lot of memories.",1512432000,,265,4.196078431372549
