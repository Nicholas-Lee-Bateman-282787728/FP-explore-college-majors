Not ""just a kid's show"" (any more than Doctor Who is ""just a kid's show""; maybe they had the same writing team? ;->), not just because it's animated. They treated themes presented, and even the audience, quite seriously for what was supposed to be a running advertisement for a British-made series of action toys (which I didn't know until I went on YouTube... ;->). Awesome cast, incredible writing; why wasn't this ever released on DVD? :(",1456963200,,550,4.861702127659575

I wouldn't recommend video tapes like this unless all you own is a VHS player...  and even then, I'd recommend you get a DVD player and wait for the awesomeness of Mighty Max to come to DVD.  :)",1150675200,,271,4.0754716981132075
