8404934,4,B003T12B0Y,"On the 10th day of Christmas 2013 I'm going to review...ROH Supercard of Honor 4. The Erick Stevens-Rhett Titus match was not great but solid. The 6 man tag team match between the team of Chris Hero,Eddie Edwards & Incognito against the team of Kevin Steen,Jay Briscoe & Magno was good but the broken top rope came in which was too hard to ignore. The Roderick Strong-Katsuhiko Nakajima match was stiff and intense but in a good way. The Bobby Dempsey-Kamala match was AWFUL! The Four Way Survival match(El Generico vs Blue Demon Jr vs Claudio Castagnoli vs Brent Albright) was not great but pretty good. The Bryan Danielson-Alex Kozlov match was solid at best. The D-Lo Brown-Colt Cabana match was also not great but pretty good. The GHC Jr-Heavyweight title match between KENTA & Davey Richards was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth and smash-mouth match of the night. The Tyler Black/Necro Butcher-Austin Aries/Jimmy Jacobs tag team match was so-so at best but still nice in it's own right. The World heavyweight title match betweeen Nigel McGuinness & Jerry Lynn was good despite the condition of the wrestlers. I give this dvd a 8 out of 10.",1387756800,,1142,4.891752577319588
