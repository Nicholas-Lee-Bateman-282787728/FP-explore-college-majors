7964284,5,B000068NLQ,"TARZAN - READ-A-LONG is a fantastic thing for the kids and adults. It has the complete story of the Robert Louis Stevenson story of Tarzan with all the character voices and a great narration by actor Roy Doltrice (TV's Beauty & The beast) It has the entire original cast too. The voices and Sound effects are great. It's a reading tool too for kid!
The menus are cleverly put together and the graphics are fun. The extras include music videos with sing-a-long capabilities and words as well. There is a game that you can find Tarzan and friends and a vocabulary section that everyone can learn foreign words. There are even two rock videos You'll Be In My Heart and Strangers Like Me. You can hear and see Phil Collins too. That is very good.
The best part for the kids and me is the fact you can listen to this story in six different languages. A very cool feature I wish I had as a kid. Our kids today are going to be smart in several different languages. You should get this. It's fun and musical! (8-27-02)",1030492800,8,1010,4.377659574468085
