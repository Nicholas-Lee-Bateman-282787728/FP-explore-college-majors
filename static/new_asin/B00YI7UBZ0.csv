7218360,1,B00YI7UBZ0,WE received  a copy that would not work in any of three devices in two homes. I asked for a replacement. We received a copy again the did not work. I asked for a refund and received it. My daughter had also ordered this from Amazon about the same time and it also did not work. It would come on but you could not get to the individual programs.,1455580800,6,344,3.9855072463768115
7218361,1,B00YI7UBZ0,This set does not work in all DVD players.  My Grandaughter could not watch it.  Out of three DVD players-it only works on one.,1454284800,4,127,4.25

7218363,1,B00YI7UBZ0,"My kids were so excited for this. We have watched our other Peter Rabbit DVDs endlessly and I was looking forward to a few more episodes. Sadly, it does not play in my car DVD player (it's a DVD-R and only runs on play-only devices). So we tried it on our home DVD player. It played, but the entire time a black bar kept flashing across the top of the screen. My kids are very disappointed. If they ever put out an actual DVD of this I will buy it, but I'm not wasting my time with these Amazon DVD-R versions again.",1445040000,14,516,4.068627450980392

7218386,1,B00YI7UBZ0,"If I could give 0, I would.  This was a supposed to be a Christmas gift for a 2 yr old.  I was informed that one disc doesn't play and the one that does, is obvious that it was recorded at [someones] home.  Very disappointed!",1484092800,2,225,3.9555555555555557
7218387,4,B00YI7UBZ0,Granddaughter loved it.  Great show.,1483660800,,36,6.2
7218388,1,B00YI7UBZ0,"I wouldnt even give this a star but in order to leave this review i had to. We ordered this for our 3 yr old for Christmas and we have tried multiple times to watch it and it does not work! We have multple devices that we have also tried the dvd in and it still does not work! Once we push play the intro song will come on and its like the first episode plays but about 4 min in, it will stop and revert back to the main menu screen. We cannot choose other episodes, when we try it again reverts back to the main menu screen. Our son was so excited to be able to watch episodes back to back so thats why we made this purchase but unfortunately it was a waste of money! If you choose to buy this item just beware this may happen to you!!",1483142400,2,736,3.848684210526316
7218389,1,B00YI7UBZ0,"My daughter was so excited to watch this DVD. We had the same problem most other reviewers did; it didn't work on our DVD player. We were able to view the menu, and choose individual episodes, but were never able to get it to play. It works on the PC, but we want to be able to watch it on the TV. We are very disappointed, and I wish I had read the reviews on this DVD before I purchased it. Don't bother buying this DVD.",1482710400,,422,3.9186046511627906

7218391,5,B00YI7UBZ0,"Only qualm is that it doesn't just keep playing the episodes, you have to physically press play after each episode to start the next which makes its a little inconvenient: especially when trying to play it on car DVD players.",1472688000,,225,4.65
7218392,4,B00YI7UBZ0,My two year old loves this show. It's not very educational so I only gave it four stars.,1468454400,,88,3.9444444444444446
7218393,4,B00YI7UBZ0,"I love this show! in my opinion, it's the best NickToon of all time (and tied with ""Ruff Ruffman"" as the best show of all-time). Amazing characters, amazing plots, amazing animation and art style, funny comedy relief, awesomely dark moments (watch ""The Tale Of The Lying Fox"", ""The Tale Of The Grumpy Owl"", or ""The Tale Of The Downhill Escape"" for great examples), AWESOME music (especially in season 2, but also applies to season 1), and very heartwarming moments (especially the end of season 2's ""The Unexpected Discovery"", that's pure tearjerker material)! Too bad the show didn't get renewed for a season 3. Now let's go over the DVD.

Video: 3.5/5
The video quality on these episodes varies on the player. When I played it on my Xbox One, it looked like a slightly better Game Boy Advance Video (remember those? yeah, pretty bad quality). When I played it on my PS3, it looks amazing by DVD standards (with only a few mildly grainy scenes, most notably in ""The Tale Of The Lost Tunnels""), but it isn't HD of course.

Audio: 4/5
The audio sounds great, even when I played it on the Xbox One.

Menus: 3/5
Nothing special, but it's well designed and simple.

Packaging: 3.5/5
The DVD case is solid. but there's also stacked discs, making it more of a task to get discs out. The artwork looks really nice, but there's no episode list on the back.

Also of note, there are no bonus features (I wanted to have UK soundtracks and audio commentaries on every episode), this is a DVD-R title, and at least one of the episodes cut off before the credits ended (at least on my copy).

Overall: 4/5
Initially I was disappointed in the video quality, but when I played it in my PS3, I was relieved that it was only the Xbox One having issues with the discs and showing them pixelated. If you're a fan of Peter Rabbit, definitely get this release. It's not the ultra-deluxe treatment that us fans want, but it's a very solid release. I'm very excited for when ""Peter Rabbit: Season Two"" comes out on DVD. Hopefully Shout! Factory will get the rights to this (and the SEVERELY-UNDERRATED Robot & Monster) and put the series on Blu-Ray with some bonus features for the fans. If you're a total completist like I am, you should also get all of the episodes in HD on Xbox Video, iTunes, or wherever you get your digital downloads from to hold you over until the Blu-Ray release comes out.",1465430400,3,4427,4.434194341943419

8718346,2,B00YI7UBZ0,Great TV series. However the DVD disc quality is horrible. Discs don't work half the time. I thought they might be bootleg but don't believe so. Had to use a different player for some discs.,1513296000,,190,4.457142857142857
8718347,1,B00YI7UBZ0,"As most other reviewers have noted, these DVDs do not play properly. The disc menu appears, and the soundtrack can be heard after a selection has been made, but there is no video.",1511654400,,179,4.454545454545454

8718351,1,B00YI7UBZ0,"We LOVE Peter Rabbit in our house and were so excited to try this out.  But, sadly like some others who reviewed below, we could not get any of the enclosed dvds to play property in our dvd/ blu-ray player. We never had an issue with any other dvd or dvd-r... so I purchased thinking the issues probably wouldn't apply to us.. but they did.  I cannot hand-select any particular episode from the main menu and when I go to play all episodes, we can start on the first one, get about 10 minutes in and it stops. brings us back to the main menu. Tried it over and over again with the same result.",1494806400,,593,4.147826086956521
