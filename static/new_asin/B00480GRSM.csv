8418442,1,B00480GRSM,narrator is either  analyzing subject ( not the art) or preparing to do an exorcism? absurd. don't bother.,1447718400,,106,4.888888888888889
8418443,2,B00480GRSM,"Low end documentary style with intrusions from Greek ""expert.""",1434412800,,62,6.0
8418444,3,B00480GRSM,the visual impact is great but unless one already know something about Dali I think it might be a little hard to follow the narrative.,1390867200,,134,4.4
8418445,5,B00480GRSM,"Not the easiest thing to watch out of the gate. Understanding what the producers were wanting to deliver does take a bit of faith in the beginning. I say go with the flow and let the story unfold. Great context, stories in stories, lessons on the art of one of the greatest ""artist"" in the past 100 years.",1375142400,,305,4.275862068965517
8418446,4,B00480GRSM,"I liked this film on Dali much better than ""Dali in New York.""

This one focused more on his work and his personal history than his public personality.  It also disclosed a much different Dali during moments when he wasn't in the public eye.

Don't miss the DVD extra content.  I found it quite informative, with information about the Golden Proportions that I've already put to use.",1368403200,,383,4.6716417910447765
8418447,3,B00480GRSM,"As a painter and a lover of Dali I found this to be an unorthodox yet accurate perspective on the Artist. Though it was not created by Dali, I think this guy is on to something. Takes me back to the good old days when a woman or man would tell a story and many believed it could be true. Like George Orwell's 1984. There is a lot to be said about 4th dimensions that many shun, that only us true Artist or ones with their open 3rd eye will every know. This was intriguing and I could play it again as background music while I paint. I gave it a 3 star rating as it is a few steps below some of my other favorites like ""Exit through the gift shop"" & all time favorite ""Camille Claudel"". People with limited capacities and a distain for large egos will turn this off within the first 5 minutes. Have a great day. Stvnski.com",1359936000,,822,4.080246913580247
8418448,1,B00480GRSM,"This movie is actually about the director's philosophical perspective on life, the universe, and the other dimensions. He occasionally mentions Dali, but only when it benefits his silly ramblings about the 4th dimension.",1356912000,3,220,5.696969696969697
