4983698,2,B006CR2PAI,Thought the line up of actresses would make the movie worth viewing. There was plenty of bad acting and bad riding. This movie did not live up the the expectation.,1360108800,,163,4.466666666666667
4983699,2,B006CR2PAI,"THIS WAS A BUMMER. CANNOT MATCH THE FIRST MOVIE EXCELENT,(GANG OF ROSES). NOW WHEN YOU GET THIS ONE IN, THEN YOU GOT SOMETHNG. PLEASE TRY AND FIND A COPY. DISAPPOINTED!",1336089600,,168,4.633333333333334
4983700,2,B006CR2PAI,"The movie is a black western. A gang of women connected to the original Gang of Roses (I admit I never saw that one)plan to rob a well armed stagecoach. There is a posse after one of them as she shot a man's brother. There is a female bounty hunter on their trail and to make things more difficult, it appears one of the members is a plant. The dialouge is boring. All the girls are overly scripted tough. This means there has to be some internal conflicts as one gang member is half Comanche while another member ""hates Indians."" These scenes highlight the writer's inability to write dialouge as well as the actor's inability to deliver lines.

The acting is very bad. In fact at one point during a jail interrogation scene it becomes comical. The sheriff is tied up and being ""hit"" to make him talk. It is very apparent the blows are being ""held back"" as the sheriff feigns being struck. There is no reason he should hold back this information to begin with, making the whole scene even more stupid.

No f-bombs or N words. Mild swearing. No nudity. Off screen sex. Two women intimate. The movie is borderline campy and doesn't mean to be.",1329523200,7,1142,4.45933014354067
