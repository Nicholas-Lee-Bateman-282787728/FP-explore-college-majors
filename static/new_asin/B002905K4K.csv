8357274,3,B002905K4K,Bought this not knowing what to expect. Only got TNA Turning Point 2008. Got at a low price though so not a big deal. Just don't get your hopes up for a 3 Pack.,1512518400,,160,3.735294117647059
8357275,5,B002905K4K,"Bought this purely out of curiosity since there is generally no information other than the TNA logo. So I bought whatever this is and received a rare TNA 3-DVD pack of Victory Road 2008, Hard Justice 2008, and No Surrender 2008. All three are good shows, so for that price I say get it if you don't have these yet!",1429488000,,314,4.25
