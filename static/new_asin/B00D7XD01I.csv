I have been trying to get the DVD for myself and as gifts to others of my family and friends, who I know for certain would appreciate an Andre Crouch live concert. What an AWESOME gift and blessing he was to not only the christain community, but to the entire world!!!! 5 stars across the board...BOOM!",1421971200,,341,4.181818181818182
8590483,5,B00D7XD01I,"I give this recording 5 stars...hands down!  I caught this recording on Public Television, on cable in 2013.  It brought back so many memories of Andra'e Crouch and the Disciples from back in the day.  I was nearly off of my seat, on the floor and in tears just hearing them sing many of my favorites.  Not to mention, Andra'e Crouch ALWAYS had some of the BEST musicians on this side of Heaven!  My issue was not having the money ($100.00) to make a donation, so that I could get the dvd from the television station (pitiful).  I have been trying to find this dvd on other sites and in the christian bookstores, but no one is carrying this one, and they should.  I would recommend this dvd or cd (if you prefer) to all of those Andra'e Crouch fans from back in the day, who want to sit and enjoy the songs that remind you of who God is, that he loves you, and what he'll do for you.  This one is a keeper, and is sure to bring out the praise that's deep down on the inside.  If someone out there knows how to get a message to the distributer, please let me know.",1402617600,3,1063,4.121359223300971
