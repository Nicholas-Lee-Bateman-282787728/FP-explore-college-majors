8082914,4,B000B7NAOU,Guys gone wild dude wheres my past is a nice throwback to the original guys gone wild. Several of the guys have great butts and a few will treat you to a full show. Great for those who love nude straight men.,1505606400,,208,3.9761904761904763
8082915,5,B000B7NAOU,"This is so funny. I had an Amazon credit after making another purchase and thought ""why not buy a corny slightly porn-y dvd,"" because people used to pay for porn right? I ended up giving it away in a white elephant gift exchange at a holiday party. It got passed around constantly because everyone thought is was hilarious/insane to give a porno as a Christmas gift. Ah, to be young and in college. Those were the days.",1448496000,,419,4.454545454545454
8082916,2,B000B7NAOU,It could've been better.,1421712000,,24,5.25
8082917,1,B000B7NAOU,"PROS:
+ None I can think of

CONS:
- The suggestion is that these are wild college-age guys but more than a few appear to be well over 30!
- Really not that erotic or entertaining

This was a total waste of money. If you're looking for erotic entertainment, I'd suggest to continue looking!",1249171200,,290,4.351851851851852
8082918,3,B000B7NAOU,"one of the first from guys gone wild.  this was when they could get
a lot of college guys to work with them.  not bad, but later editions
got better",1226534400,,148,3.9
8082919,1,B000B7NAOU,If you like guys flashing their chests and buns this is for you - other than that stay away. This is not a DVD full of hot spring break guys showing their stuff the way its advertised. There were actually a couple of guys I had to fast forward over the moment their faces appeared and no one on here really hot. It was the mediocre shows who wanted to show everything - the only thing the cute guys showed was a deflated balloon. I've gotten 3 GGW and I think that's enough. I know there is an appeal to the concept of amateur straight guys taking it off for a camera but there's got to be better done DVD's of this kind of thing out there.,1189987200,5,640,4.047244094488189
8082920,4,B000B7NAOU,This is the best i've seen so far of the series. It gets right down to the best stuff. Very little tease. Scenes not repeated throughout. I'd give it five stars if it were longer.,1174867200,5,179,4.142857142857143
8082921,1,B000B7NAOU,"I have purchased three of the series, and I got the uncensored ones.  The guys for the most part in them were dull, the photography was jumpy, dialog stupid, and what little they showed wasn't worth a quartr of what they each are selling for!  In my opinion, the complete series is a total rip-off.  Decide for yourself.",1161216000,8,320,4.482758620689655
8082922,5,B000B7NAOU,"There are 2 different Guys Gone Wild series available. The ""retail-friendly"" titles (Guys Gone Wild (original) and Guys Gone Wild: Spring Break Explosion) are more tame (think HBO), while Guys Gone Wild: Heat Stroke, Dude Where's My Pants, and Frat Boys are among the uncensored harder-to-find versions that you cannot buy in normal stores, only from certain authorized sources. I bought the wrong ones before and was disappointed, but this one is so much wilder and hotter, it is amazing. Well worth the money.",1129680000,55,511,5.095238095238095
8082923,5,B000B7NAOU,"I think that everyone woman and gay guy should have this,because its hot guys and we get to see their chests and who knows whatelse so go out and pick yourself a copy!!!!!",1127174400,13,171,4.212121212121212
