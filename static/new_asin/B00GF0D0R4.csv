6075047,3,B00GF0D0R4,"Ya, this was a decent watch, though I would probably not recommend it for primetime viewing unless you are a serious horror junkie. I'd really give it 3.5 stars. I started with 4 stars but then bumped it down because its really not the kind of movie you want to go in with unrealistic expectations. Keep them low or no. Its definitely more than OK. The budget is obviously low. Still, the production values are decent, with a good setting. The hotel was nice and creepy, and the decor was excellent. I wouldn't mind staying there, minus u know who...  The major positive contribution came from the actor who played ""the bellboy""- haha. Inside joke if you've seen it.  The other actors are adequate. I found most of the characters unsympathetic due to their treatment of ""the bellboy"" but you might not. The storyline is clean and straightforward yet not particularly novel. It had some moments of tension, generated suspense and intrigue for the rest, and I particularly liked the ending. I'd say Psycho was an influence here. There is not much else I can say without spoiling anything, so I won't. Definitely worth a watch. This is one of those the horror junkie will find more satisfying than the weekend warrior.",1391817600,23,1215,4.726415094339623
6075048,5,B00GF0D0R4,"I like this movie because after watching about a thousand horror films, less than 20 have the bad guy winning in the end. Love the change of pace. Also this movie does not do that ridiculous ""snap to black - THE END"" crap that most horror movies do when the bad guy makes a sudden come back.

6075056,4,B00GF0D0R4,"WARNING SPOILERS!!!  A lot of reviewers have given this Swedish-made slasher film bad press, but I think it's an effective little chiller. Sure, it is derivative of such film as PEEPING TOM (1960) and PSYCHO (1960), but it puts a nice little spin on the story, the acting by Lars Bethke (a Swedish TV veteran) is appropriately creepy, some camera tricks are very inventive and the location work and extreme gore make this work a lot better than it should.
Bethke is David, the sole proprietor of the huge Bridgeburn Hotel, which lost almost all its customers due to a section of Route 56 being built that bypassed the hotel. Every once in a while David gets the occasional visitor who took a wrong turn and he goes out of his way to make sure they are comfortable. Maybe a little too far out of his way. We se an unnamed woman taking a bubble bath listening to her iPod when we see the flash and hear the sound of a Polaroid camera. The woman goes to sleep and when she wakes up, she sees a Polaroid photo of her taking a bath on her pillow. She is then chased by someone wearing a gasmask and a knee-length black leather jacket, but she is unable to escape the hotel because all the doors are locked. The killer lobs a gas grenade at her and she passes out, waking up chained and hanging by her arms in a room. The gasmask-wearing killer pulls out a Bayonne and stabs her through the back of her head, the blade sticking out her mouth. The camera then flips 180, turning the killer's silhouette (the killer is listed as ""The Silhouette"" in the end credits) into an upside-down ""A"" in the film's title, as the film's opening credits begin.
A young woman named Jenny (Alida Morberg) gets lost an her way to a music festival, when she comes upon the Bridgeburn Hotel. David is glad to accommodate her every need, giving her Room 13, cooking her a meal and serving her cocktails (Jenny refuses to talk about who she is ""liaising"" with at the festival. It is apparent that both she and David are hiding secrets.) David tells her that a woman disappeared from the hotel and was never heard from again and, when he takes her to her room, he makes it a point to show her the creepy-looking quarry she can see out her bathroom window (He tells her he likes to take walks there at night). While Jenny is sleeping, we again see the flash and hear the noise of the Polaroid camera and, when she wakes up, she finds the photo of her sleeping on her night table. When she goes to David to report someone was in her room, they both go back there and the photo is missing (David mentions that the Polaroid is missing, but no one ever told him it was a Polaroid. Oops!).  That night, the gasmask-wearing man returns and Jenny jumps out her bedroom window, and she ends up in a strange room, which looks like an altar to all the killer's victims. There is blood on the walls, candles burning next to a human skull and a wall filled with Polaroid photos of his victims (including the girl in the beginning of the film). The killer throws a gas grenade and when Jenny wakes up, she is chained up in the same room as the girl in the beginning of the film. David enters the room and frees her, then ""calls"" the police, but Jenny notices the phone line is cut, runs away and it looks like David is an apparent psycho (David has Black & White flashbacks several times during the film when he was a boy at the hotel; his mother massaging his shoulders and then closing his bedroom door.). Jenny is eventually caught by the gasmask killer, as she hears him unsheathe his bayonet and is stabbed once in the stomach and once in the back (This came as a complete surprise to me because I thought Jenny was going to be the heroine in this film. David also has dreams about the gasmask man killing him, too, but he always wakes up before he is slaughtered.).
Two weeks later, Jenny's sister Sarah (Johanna Leamo) pays the Bridgeburn Hotel a visit and shows David a photo of her sister to see if he has seen her, since she had never shown up at the music festival. He says no and gives Sarah a room for the night (She wonders why one person would run such a large hotel by himself, especially when there are few or no customers, and David replies that he has ""emotional ties"" to the hotel and will never leave it.). He makes her dinner and offers her cocktails, but she fakes that she is tired and goes to her room, leaving shortly to check out the hotel's computer to see if her sister was there, but David catches her. David isn't mad at all and gives her a cigarette to smoke with him outside, while they talk about the quarry and her sister (David is an odd duck who spends all his spare time hand-painting tiny pewter figurines). A bald, fat man named Frank Donut (Lennart Strm) pays David a visit and says he is looking for an old couple that disappeared after visiting the hotel. Franks finds the old couple's van in the back of the hotel, but he has his lower jaw ripped off with a large hook wielded by the gasmask killer (a very effective scene, as we see the jaw hanging on the hook). Sarah goes to town to file a complaint with the police department, but the doors are locked, so she starts hanging missing person posters of her sister all over town (we never see anyone on the streets and it actually may be a ghost town). A stranger riding a four-wheel ATV happens upon Jenny's camouflaged car in the quarry's snow, but the gasmask killer murders him with his bayonet. Sarah is soon joined by her fiance, musician John (David Lenneman; ICE CRAWLERS - 2002), and neither John or David are pleased to see each other, especially when John first walks into the hotel and notices that there is a dinner table set for two (meaning David has romance on his mind for Sarah). David and John walk down to the wine cellar, where John warns David to stay away from his girl and David apologizes, saying he had no idea she had a fiance. Sarah discovers proof that Jenny was at the hotel, so she grabs an semi-automatic handgun out of her purse (it has one of those extended clips so it holds more bullets!) and finds John unconscious in the wine cellar with a bloody head wound. She drags John out of the wine cellar, but she has to leave him downstairs to make a phone call (no cell service in the hotel's cavernous basement), where she is attacked by the gasmask killer, but he disappears when she turns around holding the gun. She and John try to escape the hotel, but as far as they get is the creepy altar room, where Sarah notices her sister's Polaroid hanging on the wall and another piece of evidence that really upsets her (I'll leave that for you to discover). The killer strikes again and just as he is about to pull the pin on a gas grenade, John shows up with the gun and fills the killer full of lead. John pulls off the gasmask and it turns out to be David (not really a surprise there), but Sarah refuses to let John touch her and tells him to go look in the altar room to find out why. It turns out David was wearing a bulletproof vest and he bashes John's face in with a pipe (a really graphic effect), while Sarah crawls through a boarded-up window (just barely making it out) and runs, but she can't go any further because she has come to the cliff of the quarry. David catches up and begins to choke the life out of Sarah, while she tells him she can help him (A final flashbacks shows that when David was a kid, his mother actually hired him out to pedophiles. But as she is closing the door, just like in all the previous flashbacks, there is now a man with David in his bedroom and he is unzipping his pants.). David chokes Sarah until she is dead, while we are led to believe she is going to stab him with his bayonet (That is what I like about this film. When you think this film is going left, it goes right.). He dumps Sarah's body in the quarry's lake and, as she is sinking to the bottom, we see all of David's many other victims throughout the years, including Jenny. The Bridgeburn Hotel is once again open for business.
While nothing exceptional (the five screenwriters should tip you off), this is still a worthwhile slasher film because everyone you think is going to be a heroine or hero ends up dead and some of them are holding secrets and, though not as bad as David's, are still sinful nonetheless. Lars Bethke is really good in his double role of David/The Silhouette, as both of their personalities couldn't be more different. It is nearly impossible to get David mad at anything, but his other personality more than makes up for it. The killings go way past what would be acceptable for an R-rating (the jawbone removal sequence is a prime example, as it is especially nasty), The actresses that play Jenny and Sarah are dubbed, but it is done so well, you will never notice it (I believe they were speaking English, but it came off more as what I call ""Swenglish"", so they were dubbed as to not tip-off viewers that this was a Swedish film). This was the first directorial effort by Anders Jacobsson since his 1995 extreme gore film EVIL ED and it was co-directed by first-timer Tomas Sandquist (who were also two of the five screenwriters, the other ones being Michael Fuchs, Nathan Berry and Henrik Koelman [who also wrote the storyline and produced]). The snowy Swedish scenery, the large foreboding empty hotel, the creepy acting by Bethke and the mysterious quarry help immensely in making this film better than it has any right to be (like realtors say, ""Location, location, location."") and the final quarry lake scene is really creepy and raised a few goosebumps on my arms. I actually like this little piece of gory Swedish cheese and if you want to see it, you will have to watch it streaming (I watched it using my Roku 3 on Amazon Prime and it was free since I am a Prime member) or buy the DVD from Eagle One Media. Nice kills, a plot that move quickly and takes unusual turns, a take-no-prisoners killer, and an atmospheric setting makes for a creepy and engaging little splatter film. Also starring Sanna Messo, Tommy Hall, Anton Jacobsson (as the young David), Maria Litorell and Leif Henrikddon. An Eagle One Media DVD Release. Not Rated.",1445126400,,10168,4.390774125132555

Mix in a mysterious eccentric owner of a weird creepy hotel that has an unforgettable marquee that looks like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man had sex with Chef Boy R D and spawned a lunatic love child. And you actually have the best horror movie I have seen this year. This film is mind blowing! This movie actually freaked me the fu#k out.

The story is so dreamy and unbelievable and is still able to build serious tension and horror. Your watching it saying this is so stupid like yeah right who would do that and that hotel would never exist but Insane is able to suck you in and get you vested in the film. It's like some magic trick that only good writers, directors, actors and great special effects are able to do. The gore is spot on in this film effective and real looking.

I hesitate to compare this to The Shining because it stands on its own but it's just as creepy. And it's always great to see a cop eat a donut in a movie. It just makes me laugh.

6075090,2,B00GF0D0R4,"Just starting off saying I love horror movies. I kind of went into this movie blindly, just random clicking on Amazon Prime horror movies, and the first half the film I was literally twiddling my thumbs waiting for something remotely exciting to happen. Yeah there are murders but...come horror slasher movies, you expect that. They weren't even that freaky like in Saw they could come with creative murders. The acting wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the greatest either. The dialog seemed stiff, I don't fake to me.

Half way through the movie I started to compare it to Psycho, another movie set in a basically deserted high-way motel...with only the creepy weird guy at the counter handing out room keys making meals for the guests. Though I don't think it's fair judge movies based on others...I try to look at each movie in their own rights, because each movie is different...but I saw a high similarity between this movie & Psycho, including the mostly abandoned quarry area like in, the random FBI clerk showing up ruffling up the hotel guy's little world. If the movie was done well I could even look past all that, but in my opinion it wasn't.

To be perfectly honest I haven't finished the movie, I don't know if I will or not...I was having streaming issues tonight and it kept stopping then would completely exit out of the film....I went back once to see if it would get any better but did it twice so I think I'll leave it at that, I wasted enough of my time on this. If you're looking for time to kill and all you want to see is bloody murder then maybe yeah watch it otherwise don't expect anything too shocking or award winning moments.",1425945600,2,1653,4.562289562289562

6075102,4,B00GF0D0R4,"I really enjoyed this film!  First of all, know that it is a B film.  Yes, it is one of those ""B"" films, you know what I'm talking about!  Limited budget, acting fluctuating from good to pretty stiff.  HOWEVER, this is what I consider a high-level ""B"" film.  It may not be top of the line, but it is still GREAT quality with a high production value.

It is also unique, twisty, gory, sexy, suspenseful and action-packed.  And if you see this as part of your Amazon Prime package, even better!

This film is a slasher film, and uses a timeless horror subgenre (psycho killer with a very,very large knife (sword??)) and a timeless horror setting ( a creepy, retro, barely-frequented hotel on the side of an abandoned former highway).

The plot (ultimately) concerns a woman searching for her missing sister, whose trail leads her to the aforementioned hotel, it's employee-of-all-trades, David...and someone else.

I really was surprised at the creativity and the action in this film, including the unique opening and closing credits, a good deal of realistic gore (just enough to shock here and there, but not at all gratuitous as far as horror movies go), a twisty plot and plenty of action.  I really enjoyed the actor Lars Bethke as the creepy/pathetic/Euro-sexy/too-polished David.  I also enjoyed Alina Morberg as the fun-loving, adventurous and heretofore missing sister, Jenny. (I'm a woman, and I could totally relate to the part where she was alone and realized she left her cosmetic bag in the car after she had already put on her skimpy bedtime outfit, had been drinking and it was late at night...been there, done that, and was looking over my shoulder the whole time, wishing I had pepper spray, ha!!)  Her very opposite, searching older sister Sarah, played by Johanna Leamo, was also fun to watch, and I liked seeing the life-altering behavioral differences between the two.

Our villian, however, is not so scary.  He wears a gas mask, and from the shoulders up, he looks like the guy in ""My Bloody Valentine,"" not so frightening (at least to me) and not so original.  From the shoulders down, he's decked out like a Goth in a long black trench coat.  Altogether, not too bad, but not exactly the stuff of sweaty nightmares either.

_______________________________________________________

SORT-OF SPOILER ALERT! SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT TO GO IN COMPLETELY BLIND: A few paragraphs ago, I said ultimately, because, well, the film takes an odd approach to introducing the protagonist.  While most horror movies bring in the butt-kicking, villian-fighting main character within the first 15 minutes or so, it is much, much  longer (almost halfway!) until we meet the star who has the chance to save the day.  Will they succeed?  Gotta watch to find out!  I thought this late introduction was different and oddly refreshing, but, really almost NO ONE does this (and I watch a lot of horror movies), so I think a lot of people will wonder what took so long and be turned off.

_______________________________________________________

So, I do recommend this, but know that this is a ""B"" movie, some actors are very wooden and though there's gore, it is not a complete bloodbath. It is suspenseful, creepy and sometimes gives a violent shock, but it's not scary (at least not to me), unless maybe if you are a female who has or will stay at an empty hotel alone!  But even then, unless you are afraid of your own shadow, this movie shouldn't keep you up too late.  :-)  Also,there is no sex and no complete nudity (I'm a woman, and this is refreshing to me in a horror flick!  Yes, we women are sexy, can't blame you guys for wanting to see us, BUT gratuitous, pornographic female nudity is NOT neccessary in a scary movie!  Go watch a porno for that!!

It's light on plot but heavy on Slasher lover dynamics. If you are a hard core slasher fan this is a lot better than most of the trash they are putting out lately. The gore effects are done very well and even though it has somewhat of a low body count I would rather see a few great kills than a lot of ridiculous CGI clunkers.

(For example, a fat detective makes a cameo appearance at one point, apparently for no other purpose than to suffer a gory end similar to Detective Arbogast in Hitchock's original.)  No shower scene, though the villain likes to snap Polaroids of people in the bathtub.

The good parts:  the creepy 70's era motel with a lake out back (homage to the swamp in Psycho), and an evil lair in the basement.  The villain, a truly scary dude, part Darth Vader, part homicidal creep.  Lars Bethke doing the Norman Bates thing, only with a decadent European flair.

The disappointing parts:  The film cheats!  It leads us astray concerning the villain's identity with scenes that don't make sense and are never adequately explained.  The feeble attempts at a back-story really don't add anything.  Plus, the villain is just a little too invincible to create any real suspense.

8622555,4,B00GF0D0R4,"Insane begins showing a woman taking a bath and listening to music on her iPhone.  When she heads to bed she finds out that someone took a picture of her taking a bath and laid it beside her bed.  She gets freaked out.  She walks around the dark rooms and sees a man standing down the hall.  She frantically runs around while he chases after her.  When she's cornered he throws a smoke bomb.  The woman passes out on the floor and wakes up with her arms chained to the basement ceiling.  While wiggling around the man stands behind her.  She somehow knows he's there and holding a knife.  He cuts her in the back of the head as the knife goes through her mouth and she becomes cross eyed.  Wow, all the woman wanted to do was go to bed!  Then again it's never a good idea to go to bed with wet hair.  Your hair can get moldy that way.

We see a hotel receptionist named David letting in a woman named Jenny in the next scene.  She pulls out a map and wants to know where road 56 is.  David takes Jenny to her room.  She looks out the window and sees a spooky looking lake with ominous clouds over it.  Back in the dining hall David makes her dinner and joins her.  Jenny says where she's going is complicated, and only reveals a music festival 60 miles away.  Jenny asks David if he gets creeped out being here all alone.  He wants to tell her something scary that happened here but doesn't want to deprive her of her sleep.  Jenny wants him to say what it is anyway.  He says the ""knife through the mouth"" girl we see in the first segment disappeared and was never found.

Jenny sends a message on her phone to someone.  David questions who she's sending a message to and she says it's her sister Sarah.  Jenny reveals her sister is the good girl who keeps her out of trouble.  David sends Jenny to her room and tries to take advantage of her.  This results in a fight.  We now see a little boy painting his toy soldiers in his bedroom while his mom brings him a sandwich.  This is David reflecting on his past.  As Jenny changes and leaves the room a man observes her from the window.  Jenny heads outside, walks to her car, then returns to brush her teeth.  We see David continuing his childhood hobby of painting toy soldiers and figurines.

Meanwhile Jenny wakes up and sees a picture of herself sleeping by her bed.  Uh oh, a repeat of the woman from the beginning of the movie!  Jenny runs out of her room and tells David that someone was in her room.  She tells David someone took a picture of her but she can't find it now.  He thinks Jenny's drunk and she gets offended.  He tells her it was just a nightmare she had.  Jenny apologizes for being mean to him earlier.  She goes back to bed but turns the light on when she hears something.  The same man who killed that woman in the first scene appears and grabs Jenny by the throat, but she escapes outside through the window.

Jenny heads into a nearby barn and walks down the basement stairs to see pictures hanging on the wall of deceased women.  Suddenly the killer jumps down the stairs behind her like batman.  He tosses a smoke bomb her way and she passes out.  Oh no, will Jenny wake up chained to the basement ceiling too?  I think she will.  Is she going to be scared?  Yes she is!  Will she wiggle around in a poor attempt to free herself?  Yuppers.  Guess what?  David the hotel receptionist walks in and frees her!  Wow, didn't see that coming (I actually didn't even though I sound sarcastic, hehe).  While David calls for help Jenny notices that the wires on the bottom of the phone David's using aren't connected to the outlet.  He's not actually calling for help.  She freaks out and runs away.

Unfortunately the murderer guy is behind Jenny but she's able to run away.  She runs into a kitchen.  She tries smacking the man with a frying pan but he just tosses her around.  Out of nowhere in front of the receptionist desk, he stabs Jenny to death.  Hey David where are you?  She kinda needed your help!  It's not like you were calling for help anyway.  You forgot to plug the phone in!  Oh *a moment later*.  There he is.  If only he showed up 10 seconds earlier.  The man knocks David on the floor and cuts his throat but... David apparently imagined this scenario because we now see David standing in another room holding his throat.  But Jenny really did get stabbed.  This part was NOT made up.

Another woman walks into the hotel.  It's Jenny's sister Sarah.  It's 2 weeks later and she's looking for Jenny because she's missing.  David assures her he hasn't seen Jenny and the woman apologizes for being pushy.  While in her bedroom Sarah talks to her boyfriend John who tries to ease her worries by saying her sister's probably out there and that Sarah shouldn't worry.  David invites her to the dining room since she's hungry.  Sarah encourages him to use his very good cooking skills to move his establishment to a livelier location.

Sarah says the difference between her and Jenny is that she's more of a planner whereas Jenny's spontaneous.  David thinks Sarah's good looking.  Sarah pretends to head back to her room only to quietly leave and head to the receptionist's desk.  She goes onto a computer and... turns around and gets caught by David.  Oops!  She asks for a smoke and they have a discussion outside.  It's morning and thank goodness.  The gloomy night setting was getting to be a bit much!  David tries to keep Sarah around for breakfast but she has to leave.  David asks if she'll return tonight and if so he'll give her some good food.  Meanwhile David flashes back to his childhood years with his mom rubbing his shoulders as he eats sandwiches.  What a good little boy you are!

An FBI agent invites himself into David's hotel.  He doesn't want any official business.  David asks if he's here for Jenny (the missing girl) but the agent says he's here about the disappearance of an elderly couple.  While the FBI agent sneaks around outside the killer comes up from behind and sticks a hook in his mouth, literally ripping his mouth off.  Meanwhile Jenny's sister heads around town hanging up Missing Girl papers.  She meets up with her boyfriend and they kiss.  A man riding a fourwheeler out in the snow uncovers something, but by the time he figures out what it is the killer has a knife stabbed in his back.  I guess we'll never know what he uncovered.  Jenny's sister Sarah returns to the hotel with her boyfriend.  David says it won't cost them any extra for sharing a room.

The boyfriend thinks it's weird that David didn't know he was coming and yet, he had two plates set out on the table.  This implies David was going to join Sarah at the table.  David and the boyfriend walk down to the basement together.  David wants to know what happened to his wife's engagement ring.  He flips out and says ""It's none of your business!"".  He gets upset about that romantic dinner set for two upstairs and says anymore passes at his woman and he'll get even more upset.

The boyfriend keeps antagonizing David by saying he knows what kind of guy he is pretending he's not experienced with women.  Meanwhile Jenny's sister Sarah grabs a gun and heads into the basement.  Wasn't her boyfriend and David just down here having a conversation?  She finds her boyfriend dead on the floor.  David walks in and asks what happened.  Sarah points a gun to David and asks if he killed her sister.  She shoots him in the shoulder but with all the blood you'd think his head blew off.

David stumbles into the room where the killer's lurking, and the killer chops him right on top of his head.  Sarah drags her boyfriend across the floor.  In the kitchen the killer kicks a gun across the floor just beyond Sarah's reach.  The killer pulls her from under a table right after she's able to grab the gun but... he disappears.  Sarah picks up her boyfriend and they try to walk away.  They stumble into the room Jenny saw with the pictures of deceased women hanging on the wall.  The killer appears and tosses Sarah around.  Before he has the chance to pull the smoke bomb Sarah's boyfriend shoots him several times.  The boyfriend pulls the mask off revealing David.

Sarah finds Jenny... well not really.  She finds pictures of Jenny being tortured.  Not only that, but she found pictures of her boyfriend *with* Jenny!  The two were in a relationship without Sarah knowing!  Did David or the killer know about the cheating scandal I wonder, or was it just a coincidence David or the killer happened to hang up pictures of Jenny with Sarah's boyfriend?  Or maybe he deliberately attached the boyfriend to Jenny's pictures just to mentally mess with Sarah.  But if that's the case, how would David or the killer have had access to the boyfriend's pictures?  Unless he secretly took pictures of the boyfriend the moment he arrived.  Too many questions, haha.

Just then the killer breaks the boyfriend's arm through the glass door and grabs the boyfriend around the neck before beating him like cray.  It's now clear the killer's actually David.  But wait!  Is there actually two killers and one of them is David?  Pretty sure earlier we see both the killer and David in the same room at the same time, unless one of the men is just David's imagination.  Who knows.  David smacks the heck out of Sarah's boyfriend with a piece of lumber.  That was one big smack!  Sarah tries to poke through a window and free herself.  David lets her get a head start before grabbing her leg.  She gives him a major kick prompting him to let go.  Outside David chases Sarah across the dirt until she arrives to a high cliff.  She's stuck.  He squeezes Sarah's neck and obeys her desperate ""I can help you"" cries which brings back more childhood memories.  This is a bad memory.  The reason he was locked in his room as a kid is so a man can come by and have sex with him, while the mother agrees and closes the door.

David strangles Sarah on the dirt.  You can't help but feel sorry for David given his mom only pretended to be nice by giving him sandwiches, but the sandwiches were a nice gesture just to allow strange men to walk into David's room and do him.  The movie ends after this as we see all the victims in the water.  A surprise ending for sure!  Awesome story, acting and characters.  This movie has a little bit of a low budget vibe, but it's not a distraction by any means since the story never lets up.  The low budget nature doesn't mess with the strong story and characters.
