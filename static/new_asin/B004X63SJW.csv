4492465,3,B004X63SJW,"I watched this because the movie was filmed in Kanab, Utah.  (Over 200 movies and television shows have been filmed in and around Kanab, and they celebrate their film history every August at Western Legends Roundup). A lot of the movie was filmed at the Parry Lodge (they have QUITE the film history) and you can still stay there today.  (The stars stayed at the Parry Lodge when filming in Kanab - and still do stay there.)  Howard Koch produced and directed several movies in Kanab over the years, primarily westerns.

The movie isn't that great but it was entertaining. It's fine for being a ""B"" movie mystery. (I like the ""B"" movies.)  Reminds me of the movies I used to watch on a Saturday afternoon. It has a GREAT cast, including Dan Blocker (Bonanza) playing a bartender (the bar is still there & located just over the border from Kanab in Fredonia, Arizona, John Dehner, Anne Bancroft, Lex Barker, and Mamie Van Doren.

For me, the most fun part of this movie was being able to visit some of the places where the movie was actually filmed.  Again, I found the movie entertaining.",1402358400,4,1088,4.577319587628866
4492466,5,B004X63SJW,"Pretty good late 50's murder mystery.  Assorted people, mostly beautiful women, are being brutally murdered at a Utah resort.  There is no limit of suspects, even the quadriplegic resort owner.  I rather liked Mamie Van Doren in this.  Whatever I've seen her in, she rarely seemed to play a DUMB blonde.  The music is great, the locales authentic, and the black-and-white photography is perfect.  The MGM Limited Edition DVD-R release is excellent quality.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1400889600,6,492,5.151898734177215
4492467,5,B004X63SJW,"The fabulous Mamie Van Doren stars in The Girl In Black Stockings and it is a mystery story released in 1957. Pretty well done, and the secondary characters are fleshed out also. Great support from Lex Barker. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of he last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1397865600,3,377,4.178082191780822
4492468,1,B004X63SJW,"Bad acting, bad script.  A lot of people like this, maybe I was just in the wrong mood for it.  Thought it to be a C picture.",1393977600,,125,3.5925925925925926
4492469,3,B004X63SJW,"An apeman, a pin-up model, and a psychopath walk into a bar... and what you've got is THE GIRL IN BLACK STOCKINGS, a 1957 B-movie psychological whodunit. Me, I recognize Lex Barker mostly from his five films as Tarzan, so there's a curiousity factor whenever I come across a picture in which he's living down the loincloth stereotype. Barker plays Los Angeles lawyer David Hewson, holidaying in a Utah lodge resort and romancing a cute switchboard operator (Anne Bancroft). The lovey-dovey stuff gets derailed when a serial killer begins to make the lodge a less touristy sort of place.

The gristly murders take place off-camera so there's this bland, clinical feel to the film. Some application of psychology may reveal several obvious suspects, one of whom is the misogynistic quadriplegic (Ron Randell) who owns the lodge and cuts everyone down with his venomous remarks, another being his possessive spinster sister (Marie Windsor). Fans of the body beautiful (and who of us isn't?) may appreciate Lex Barker's showcasing his beefcake physique. Dude spends chunks of the film in pool wear. But my eyes truly sharpened each time platinum blonde Mamie Van Doren, she of the sexpot rep and the breathy voice, walked on camera playing a sultry starlet. She, uh, makes you notice her.

THE GIRL IN BLACK STOCKINGS benefits from its intriguing title but can't live up to the promise. It could've done with more showing, less talking. Lex Barker, when not being monosyllabic and achieving locomotion by way of jungle vines, is a still capable leading man. It's a shame he's torpedoed some by a sluggish screenplay. It's a decent watch, I guess, if you don't mind that it's got this low-budget television show feel to it. I'm cool with having seen it once. But that's it. Sorry, Mamie. 2.5 out of 5 stars for THE GIRL IN BLACK STOCKINGS. An average whodunit.",1374278400,4,1855,4.904458598726115
4492470,4,B004X63SJW,"Love Mamie Van Doren. Love Mari Windsor. Very camp movie. Great rainey day DVD watching. Thought Mamie's fifties platnium look,personified the the great look of the blonde bomshells. So pleased, I can buy films like this from AMAZON. As I live in SYDNEY Australia, we don't these DVDS. For sale in the shops. Thanks a lot AMAZON.",1344297600,2,329,4.7894736842105265
4492471,3,B004X63SJW,"At a Utah resort, the mutilated body of a pretty girl is discovered. Everyone at the resort becomes a suspect. This minor ""B"" B&W murder mystery has a cult following but its titillating metaphorical title aside, it's really nothing special. The direction by Howard W. Koch plods along without the faculty needed to ante up the stakes and when the killer is revealed, it's no surprise. This was the last film of the young Anne Bancroft before she bolted Hollywood and went to Broadway and you can see why. If this was the best they could give her, it was never going to happen for her in Hollywood. Ron Randell as an embittered quadriplegic gives some strange line readings but no one stands out here, not even Mamie Van Doren and her pulchritude. The score is by Les Baxter. With Lex Barker, Marie Windsor, John Dehner, Stuart Whitman, Diana Van Der Vlis and Dan Blocker (BONANZA). The film's credits does have an amusing credit however. It reads ""Women's costumes by The Pink Poodle of Kanab, Utah""!

The DVD from the MGM MOD (manufactured on demand) program is a crisp looking full screen transfer.",1316304000,5,1100,4.699481865284974
4492472,2,B004X63SJW,"Judge James A. Stewart, DVD Verdict-- While this low-budget movie never held Oscar promise, the prospects of Mamie Van Doren (Francis Joins the WACs) and filming in scenic Kanab, Utah, might make the limited-print release from MGM look like fun. In the first few minutes, the movie directed by Howard W. Koch has at least some potential, with silly and clever romantic dialogue (""Are you breathing this hard because of me or the altitude?"") and an interesting scene in which he pans a crowd for their reactions as they see the first corpse.

As the movie goes on, the sheriff (John Dehner, The Doris Day Show) meets the suspects, one or two at a time, with the highlight being a struggle with the crazy drunk who found the knife. You don't get to see that much of Van Doren, except for a bit where she's acting like an overly affectionate drunk at a dinner party. The occasional shot of Mamie beside the pool was about the only excitement in the movie beyond the first few minutes of setup.

Of course, you might be amused by the overwrought descriptions of offscreen dead bodies, as when the first victim's wounds are described as ""a frenzied pattern of disfigurement,"" and repeated psychoanalyses of the unknown killer. There are also some clunky killer's-eye view shots, but they were just sloppy, not ridiculous enough for unintentional laughs.

There are a few flecks in the black-and-white picture, but nothing major. The music of Les Baxter doesn't fare too badly, even in mono. There are no extras.

What makes this a poverty row classic??
Well Anne Bancroft is in it, and she really does shine. There is an element of mystery but it's not too hard to figure out who the killer is. Enjoy it",1446508800,,228,4.088888888888889
4492477,3,B004X63SJW,"Once again, I only bought this movie by accidently pushing the wrong button on my Playstation controller (too easy to do). I didn't want to buy it because, after reading the limited description of it, I realized I had already seen it. That being said, it is a pretty good film noir murder mystery with some good actors, most notably Anne Bancroft. Unfortunately, when you already know the ending, it pretty much kills the suspense.",1435536000,,431,4.76

8446318,3,B004X63SJW,"This is not a great movie---it is pure 50's ""C"" being too positive.  The main reason I ordered it was because it was filmed entirely at that time, in the town I now live in.  Thus it shows Kanab, my town, in the 50's---mainly got it not for the acting but the short scenes of a town I did not know about at that time. It historic and hysteric.",1514246400,,343,3.9565217391304346
8446319,4,B004X63SJW,"Yes the script is hopeless at times and Ron Randell can't stop chewing the scenery, but this is an excellent B Movie. Extremely well-filmed in glorious B&W, it captures the 50's beautifully. John Dehner is great as the sheriff and Marie Windsor shows why she truly was the Queen of the B's. But, the real ""back at the drive-in"" bonus is the pairing of Lex Barker and Anne Bancroft. They seal the deal.",1507161600,2,401,4.506849315068493

8446322,4,B004X63SJW,"Generally good B picture with above average performances from most of the supporting cast. It was fun to see John Dehner in a rare good guy role as the sheriff trying to solve the crimes, and nice to see him played as having some brains instead of being some bumbling fool. The location filming is put to good use. The only real complaint I have is for the pretty over top quadriplegic brother. Hard to get in a mystery/thriller mood when someone that overwrought is chewing the scenery.",1468972800,2,487,4.545454545454546
8446323,3,B004X63SJW,"This was definitely in the B- range, but I still found it fun to watch. Many of the actors are usually excellent, but when you're reading silly lines, it comes out silly. This may be especially true if you're playing across from over-the-top actors or characters. Seeing Ann Bancroft (what a beauty!) in what was evidently the last film of her first phase in Hollywood makes one understand why she returned to Broadway. And anyone who traveled in the western USA in the 50s or 60s will enjoy hanging around the Parry Lodge for a bit. (By the way, outside of the big cities, the 60s and even the 70s were still essentially still the 50s in the western U.S.) It's an iconic motor lodge that will remind you of the old Travel Lodge and Holiday Inn motels that were the mainstay of car travel for most of us back then.",1468886400,,814,4.397350993377484

8446327,4,B004X63SJW,"Another noir flick- worth viewing. This was an early Anne Bancroft film- seems a bit of a different role for her.
The story has an OK twist.",1466812800,,140,4.222222222222222
