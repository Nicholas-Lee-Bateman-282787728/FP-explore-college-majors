7949505,4,B00005Q31B,"You can't have too many copies of Dr. Seuss classics, and this one isn't nearly as well known as some of the others, but it's just as awesome!",1385769600,,142,4.107142857142857
7949506,4,B00005Q31B,"I loved this when I was 4 because it was colorful and the  sequences led into each other at such a speed.  Sometimes you are just nutted out by the amount of crazy junk that is on screen at the same time.  What it lacks in educational content it more than makes up for in sheer imaginative story telling.
What is with the mandolin with arms and legs?  It has always my favorite character. It seems like its designers may have been influenced by the psychedelic cartoons of the seventies.  Everything is, of course, from the mind of Dr. Suess,who had a mind only to delight children placing himself in a childlike state of mind.  But I still love this thing at age 19 alongside the likes of Yellow Submarine and The Point for its loopy dreamlike qualities.  Show it to your kids-imagination is sorely lacking in child media nowadays and this show certainly jump started mine.
My one question-if Dr. Hoober-Bloob spends this much time showing each newborn baby what their options are to live on Earth, how can he process so many?",1044144000,,1027,4.548913043478261
7949507,5,B00005Q31B,"This movie is fabulous. The cartoon is shown from the persepective of a child trying to decided whether or not it should be born. Dr. Suess' fun and intresting characters tell of all life's trials ans excitments with some really catchy songs. This movie would be an intresting alternative to watching the same old barney tapes for children, as well as a look back at childhood for adults. Heck I am 20 and I still love watching it. I hope you all enjoy!",1005091200,6,453,4.469879518072289
7949508,5,B00005Q31B,Dr. Seuss brings his incredible humor and wonderful characters to life in this amazing tale of one boy who is trying to figure out what kind of life he wants to live.  Fun for children of all ages.,961977600,2,197,4.184210526315789
