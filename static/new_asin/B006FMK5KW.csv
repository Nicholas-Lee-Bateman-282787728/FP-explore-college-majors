8497075,1,B006FMK5KW,This has got to be the worst I have seen. First of all get that guy some oxygen. He has no business being out in the woods he can barely breathe. Secondly there are no positive words to be posted about this video. I will just leave it at that.,1388016000,2,243,3.88

8497078,1,B006FMK5KW,"I actually sat with a pad of paper and pen while I watched this to write down questions that came up for me. I had two pages by the time I finally skipped through the last 20 minutes. The bottom line question: Why, if this is a known elk hunting area, would they not question everything they found? Every 'nest' they came across should have been suspected to be a hunter's shelter or blind rather than a bigfoot nest.

Why do these people not carry any sample collecting items into the field? I would have taken a sample of the scat, the 'pee' on the tree, and I would have spent time with a magnifying glass trying to find hair samples in the 'nests'.

How close is this area to campgrounds, trailheads, or other human habitation? Why did they not set up their own blind and do a night observation? And why would they bother making a 'guard station'? All of those finds were way too out in the open to be credible bigfoot creations.

For $2.99, watch for yourself. It won't break the bank. I do believe there are creatures out there that have been undiscovered, but these folks have not proven a thing. They need to spend more time collecting physical evidence and invest in a better quality video camera so that their videos and photos of the footprints and such come out a lot clearer.

This is like a poor man's ""Finding Bigfoot""--poor-quality video, shaky camera work, and all the salient aspects either out of camera range or earshot for the viewer to make any real decision as to authenticity.

Nice try guys!",1362009600,4,1516,4.478260869565218
