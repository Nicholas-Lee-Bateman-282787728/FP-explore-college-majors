8271383,4,B0018XNZG4,"Admittedly Walerian Borowczyk is an acquired taste. I have had La Bete (The Beast) in my collection for some time and finally got around to watching it. European Art Porn, but still fascinating. All I saw here was Beast and Immoral Tales, but I knew there was more to his oeuvre than that. Definitely needs a release. Did a further search and found that Arrow (UK) is in the process of releasing his films, in part because of Terry Gilliam. Hopefully soon.",1389744000,,456,4.573170731707317
