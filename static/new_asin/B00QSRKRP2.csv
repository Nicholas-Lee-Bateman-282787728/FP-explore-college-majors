8692739,4,B00QSRKRP2,My 8 1/2 year old completive dancer tried this dvd for the first time today and she loved it! Although a lot of these stretches demonstrated on the dvd she does at her dance studio! she usually only stretches at home for maybe 15 minutes every once in awhile so this motivated her to stretch MUCH longer! I would have to agree with other reviewers that said the stretches are not held long enough but I solved that problem by pausing when I felt like she could use a little longer of a stretch! Overall I think it will be a good resource to get her even more flexible than she already is!,1500595200,3,588,4.212389380530974
8692740,3,B00QSRKRP2,Bought for my 9 year old who is a figure skater.  The program is very long and she doesn't have the patience to do it all at once.  1 1/2 hour+ There is too long in-between positions and they are not held long enough.,1466121600,2,217,3.909090909090909
8692741,4,B00QSRKRP2,"I have used Stacey's method for the past month and I am extremely happy with it. I can totally see that I am getting flexible, closer to my splits, and more confortable in the positions. I have been using it four times a week.
I love how she empahizes on breathing, and contracting the miscles to help you reach deeper in the streches.
I feel that I am slowly getting to know my body better :)

I'm giving it only four stars because I feel that the ''middle Split'' qtretches were often too hard for me to do :( espacially stretches like the pancake split were it seems that my hips are stuck, and I would have loved for the dvd to insist on this sort of movements.",1437091200,2,665,4.1953125
8692742,5,B00QSRKRP2,"This DVD is wonderful! I don't understand some of the negative comments about it. She does very we'll explaining each stretch, and does offer modifications if you are not quite flexible enough to fully execute a particular stretch. There is also a fairly good length pause between each stretch before the DVD moves on to the next one so if you want to hold a stretch longer you have plenty of time to pause the DVD. I can't wait to try her other DVD's!",1430611200,2,452,4.392857142857143
8692743,5,B00QSRKRP2,"This is a creative stretch routine that includes a lot of tips that make a big difference in increasing one's flexibility. I find Stacey Nemour to be very appealing and calming. I like how she seems gently amused with life.

 I would recommend it for people that have already been stretching regularly but haven't been able to meet their flexibility goals, as well as people that are new to stretching but have an intense desire for greater flexibility quickly (just be really careful and warm up with cardio--you'll be sore the next day too, so if you can get a massage then that will help (and lucky you!)). The splits won't be the only positive results from this routine, but you do have to do it with some regularity and do other stretching in between uses (meaning on days you don't use the DVD, etc.).",1430179200,,807,4.558620689655172
8692744,1,B00QSRKRP2,"I really hated this DVD. I Today I found this site and these download videos. I was very happy because the description of the movie says that they are a great content, and would really help me to achieve a better stretching. But, the content is horrible. Actually it is just the teacher showing how she is really great and amazing. There are none variation for beginners, none types, none progressions, nothing. It is just one hour showing herself and doing the really same types of stretching that already exists on youtube. Do not waste your money here.",1429574400,5,555,4.673469387755102
