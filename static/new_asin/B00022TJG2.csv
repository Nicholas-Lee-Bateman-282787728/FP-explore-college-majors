8020873,5,B00022TJG2,"I recently purchased this VHS at the bargain price of $4.35 (including S&H)from Videooyster. I heartily recommend them. It was a rental but the picture quality is as good as it gets for VHS and the original clamshell case arrived intact. I hadn't seen these episodes in over 45 years. I was a 14 year old boy with a big crush on 16 year old Annette Funicello. The backstory on this is that the real-life Annette had a crush on handsome Guy Williams (Zorro) and when Walt Disney became aware of this, he gave Annette a guest starring role in 3 episodes as a birthday present. All 3 episodes are presented here in sequence and retaining their opening and closing credits resulting in a 74 minute movie of sorts. Annette was enjoying the first major wave of popularity in her career during her early post-mousketeer days and her appearance on any TV show was a big deal for us kids. The plot concerns itself with Anita Cabrillo's (Annette) attempt to find her long lost father with whom she has been communicating by mail from Spain to California and yet no one in Old California seems to have heard of this man. Is she imagining things or making them up?  Who is trying to kill her and why? Annette is quite lovely here and it's easy to see why she was so popular. Her acting here is very good! Her Anita is sweet but also headstrong, spoiled and a little petulant (qualities the real Annette did not display). She even sings an acoustic version of her hit ""Lonely Guitar"". This is a thoroughly enjoyable light melodrama with all the Disney touches and Disney regulars including Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon who would also support Annette in ""Babes in Toyland"". This is highly recommended not only for Zorro fans but for any Annette Funicello fans or 50's Disney nostalgia collectors. The contrast between Annette Funicello and her modern counterparts (Lindsay Lohan? Britney Spears?) is more than a little shocking and makes me long for the good old days when the girl you had a crush on was one you could actually bring home to Mother. Grab one of these tapes while they're so inexpensive and before they're all gone.",1167350400,,2118,4.618037135278515
8020874,4,B00022TJG2,This was one of my very favorite sequences of the Disney Zorro series.  Annette Funicello plays a major role.  The video was crisp and clear.  Audio quality was excellent.  My only disappointment was that the whole Zorro theme song was not included anywhere on the tape.,1126224000,3,270,4.804347826086956
8020875,5,B00022TJG2,"I loved these episodes as a child, and continue to enjoy them as an adult. Although in Black & White, it is a joy to have good, wholesome family entertainment that everyone can enjoy!

Thundering hooves and a flashing  sword herald his presence  ... a slashing ""Z"" marks the triumphs! Guy Williams stars as the legendary  masked hero in this classic action-packed adventure from the  original Disney television series!

Mystery surrounds pretty Anita Cabrillo (Annette Funicello) who arrives from Spain for a reunion with her father at his lavish hacienda -- only to discover that neither the ranch nor her beloved father seem to exist. Several subsequent death threats culminate in a terrifying brush with death as Don Ciego, disguised as the masked hero Zorro, attempts to unravel  the puzzling secret behind Anita's missing father.",1102896000,,834,5.133333333333334
