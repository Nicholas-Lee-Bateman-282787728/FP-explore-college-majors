8306294,4,B001GNG306,"Well, as a Frenchman, I was not so anxious, at first, about an old American TV show I had never seen ...but ...I wanted having more than a quick look to this Lights out, volume 4.  Why ? As they said here  : Beware this woman !  And the woman is no less than Veronica Lake. Yet,  I have only seen this first pisode. Not so bad .... Here again, she is a witch....not so beautiful as in I married a witch, but fine. And I must disagree with Robert Strom 's commentary on a factual point :  Veronica's hair is shorter, but clearly not dark : here she is a real blonde as she always was !  Glenn Denning is dark, not Veronica Lake, clearly a blonde.  Some fine pictures and scenes, and always her voice, often warm. As Robert Strom, I was about Veronica Lake in this TV show (December 1950), and the DVD (cop. 2008), I think, is  worth buying, if only for the famous actress. She was a witch by 1942, and again in this little story. What a shame there is not a fine copy (remastered), or even a Blu-ray  for I wanted wings !  Young Veronica Lake,  W. Holden, and the planes. You know, V. Lake got her wings. She had a spirit.",1482278400,,1121,4.073059360730594

8306298,3,B001GNG306,"I have only watched the episode with Veronica Lake. That's the only reason I bought it. That episode is unique. The story is fair, but certainly not Twilight Zone quality in any way; sets, lighting production values. Veronica is fine in the dramatic part of an over-achieving aviatrix. Don't expect to see her signature peek-a-boo hairstyle. Her hair is short and dark. Not having seen the complete DVD yet, I can't give a fair rating. Based on Veronica's episode, I will say this; Lights Out was scarier as a radio show!",1417305600,3,521,4.736263736263736
