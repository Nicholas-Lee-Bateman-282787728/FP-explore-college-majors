8309826,5,B00004TIYZ,I recently purchased the Americanized DVD of the Champions.  My provider was very helpful and answered my questions promptly.  My package came on the exact day I was told it should come. I would definitely make purchases from this provider again.  The DVD is a very good quality.  I have other shows from the same time period that do not have the same clarity. Some of the speaking is a little off but not bad enough to make a difference. The acting is very good. It's not as high-tech as shows today (huge wireless phones with antenna's) which is part of the enjoyment for me. I really love this DVD set and hope to purchase more when they hopefully become available. I believe this is the only volume that can play in the US without a special DVD player. If you enjoy watching old television shows then you will enjoy this. From a scale of 1-10 (ten being the best) I would rate it a 10.,1359676800,,889,4.337349397590361
