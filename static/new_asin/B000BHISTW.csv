8086767,4,B000BHISTW,"This film is an oddity.  It has a clear message, but its quirky humor and touchy subject matter can sometimes be offputting.  Overall- this movie is entertaining- sometimes extending into the 'so-bad-its-good-realm.'  It's a quick watch- and the director's other two original films are included on the disc as well.",1516233600,,315,5.26
8086768,1,B000BHISTW,"This is a horribly produced, directed and acted short movie. Believe it or not, I actually watched all 24 excruciating minutes of it. As a pastor of a college church, I can guarantee that I will never use this movie in our church, except to show how bad Christians are at producing media that is relevant and relatable to where young people are really coming from. I think the subject matter, addiction to [...] among Christians, is an important, often hidden issue, but . . . this movie! I just couldn't take it seriously. If I played this dvd in my church, I wouldn't be able to get people stop laughing at how riduculously bad it is. It is maybe the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie.
I do appreciate being sent a free copy to preview, I would have been really upset had I paid money for it. Thanks for the encouragement to write a review on Amazon for your DVD. . . I hope this is what you were looking for.",1154390400,3,918,4.221590909090909
8086769,5,B000BHISTW,"My mom always told me to stop or I'd go blind but I didn't listen.  Luckily I could see well enough to order the DVD.  Thanks to this movie I have stopped!  Actually, I met the guys who made it at the Pittsburgh NYWC and bought my copy there.  Since then I have showed it to my highschool physics class (during the friction section of course...see the shower scene) and the students responded well.  It deals with a tough topic in a great way...if you are a million years old and have a tough time talking to teens about this subject...then you need to get this DVD!!!  Thanks again guys",1131062400,3,587,4.290909090909091
8086770,4,B000BHISTW,"I recently showed this DVD to a couple of teen guys and we got a kick out of this independent film.  This is a great film that deals head-on with the problem of pornography in today's American society, but with a sense of humor.  The acting and dialogue is cheesy, but understandable seeing that this is a movie with a very low budget.  The guys hearts are in the right place though.  I recommend this film for any group that wants to begin a discussion on the dangers of pornography and sexual addictions.",1130112000,2,506,4.408602150537634
8086771,4,B000BHISTW,"I am encouraged to see a ministry taking such a touchy subject head on. Beating The Bunny is a movie with moderate acting (aside from one or two cheesy scenes) and decent special affects considering the time and resources used to complete it.

 Since the topic of pornography and masturbation is extremely seldom talked about, and even more-so avoided in the church today, Beating The Bunny attempts to pull no punches and expose a rampant plague in our society and even within the body of Christ.

 Throughout the film, there are quite a few times the viewer will get in a laugh (even at some cheesy parts that are complimentary to the characters development). Also, there are moments that the viewer can become smacked between the eyes as the blunt truth of the spread and affects of pornography are exposed within a scene.

 Beating The Bunny is a movie that I personally think should be viewed by youth leaders and small groups. As a minister or leader views the film, I think they should also remember that if there is something in the film that catches them off guard, which the director has possibly placed it there so that the viewers are provoked to thought, and that the topic is projected to discussion within groups.

 I personally recommend Beating The Bunny to anyone, church-goers, professing Christians, or not. This film is very open, applicable, and relatable to people from pretty much and belief system and walk of life since we each live in a culture soaked in sex and sensuality.

 Now, if you have seen this film, share it with others. If you haven't seen Beating The Bunny, ask someone who has, and finally, go watch it yourself!",1128902400,2,1653,4.708333333333333
