1966534,5,B000127YXI,"While watching this movie with my husband last night, I kept saying aloud, ""Oh my goodness, this is lovely, just lovely."" It's so lush and lyrical and downright touching (oooh, I hate to use that word, for fear readers will think it's sappy or stupid, and it's not - but it IS touching). You fear all will not end well for dear Olaf, a huge country `boy,' a 40yo self-proclaimed virgin whose other major problem is that he's illiterate. But Olaf has a heart of the purest gold. He has lived alone on a remote Swedish country farm with his dog and his chickens, cows, and horses. There is one `friend,' Eric, a slick man-of-the-world, who has been borrowing money from him. Olaf can't even read the IOU notes Eric gives him now and then.
Olaf, shy and socially awkward, has been alone since his mother's death a decade earlier. There's nothing weird about his love for his mother; you don't get the sense he's a momma's boy. It's just that, way out at the end of the road, there's not much opportunity to meet women. So he puts an ad in a big newspaper for `a housekeeper.'
Enter: Ellen. Obviously a city girl, in her fitted suit, upswept French twist, and high heels. And obviously, she has a past, a secret, a hidden flaw, because otherwise, why would this urbane woman be answering an ad to go live on a remote farm?
Eric, jealous and fearful that his abuse of Olaf's trust will be discovered, determines to discover Ellen's secret.
That's enough of a set-up to get you started on your way to the video store to rent this absolutely beautiful, redemptive movie. See it, and recommend it to all your friends if you love it as much as I did.",1078012800,28,1641,4.437086092715232
1966535,5,B000127YXI,"This is a delightful movie.  I caught it on late night television.  I was actually just about to go to bed when I clicked on to the station showing it.  Unfortunately I missed the first maybe 20 mins maybe less.
The cinematography was wonderful  I have lived in Sweden, and you could feel the heat of a swedish summer day, taste and smell the swedish countryside.  I have read the H.E. Bates short story ""The Little Farm""  I loved the fact that it was set in Sweden.  The cast were amazing. The power of this movie was that the viewer was transported into the moment.  You were a part of it, a part of the characters lives.  You cared very much what happened to them. I wanted it to go on.  In fact, I wanted to see the rest of their lives.  I really want to buy this movie, but so far it appears to be unavailable.  I do hope that will change.  Colin Nutley has made another movie using Swedish actors and technicians.  Swedish films are unique.  I don`t know whether it is the light, or the cinematography, or the casts and crews, but they are able to involve the viewer into the lives of the characters with such ease.  The process is magical.  ""Under Solen"" was all of that.  Simply magical.

1966536,4,B000127YXI,"A wonderful, heart-warming story about an aging, simple-minded farmer who has never known love, and the woman he meets when he decides that if he doesn't try it once, he might never know love at all....
The actors are uniformly sweet and engaging, and the story plays itself out slowly and calmly. This is a little Swedish vacation, into the past and the countryside, and the simple life of a good-hearted farming man. Gorgeous cinematography. And wonderful details... it was great to see the traditional Mora clock, quietly ticking away, and reminding our dear farmer that life is short, and he should take life by the reigns and do his best. He does, and it's lovely.
Those who love this film should see ""House of Angels,"" another of Nutley's quiet gems.

1966537,5,B000127YXI,"I saw this movie (subtitled) at the Cinequest film fest a while back and still feel it's one of the BEST films I've seen -EVER! The cinematography makes you feel as if you are there. The characters are great -shy, caring, awkward. You become absorbed in their experiences and the suspense as their relationships change and transmute. I can hardly wait to see it again. I highly recommend this film.",1006387200,8,398,4.7
1966538,5,B000127YXI,"Under The Sun is exquisite without being precious; filled with sentiment though not sentimental; it has a power yet it never raises its voice.  It is not a feel-good movie though one leaves the theatre certainly feeling better than when they walked in.  I think the power of the film comes with its authenticity in depicting the human actions and interactions.  This authenticity disarms us and exposes our humanity in ways few films ever achieve.  Beyond this, each scene can stand on its own as a visual work of art.  Bravo!",1004918400,6,526,4.736263736263736
1966539,4,B000127YXI,"After a quick and casual glance at some reviews of ""Under the Sun"", I had an idea this movie was a sort of ""Jules and Jim"".  As I watched it unfold, I realized that it was it's own, unique and beautifully presented film.  Its' title means to tell us that there is nothing new under the sun and that this is just another love story.  That may well be true but we come away in appreciation of the quality in this film that leaves us thinking that this is indeed something special (and it is!).  What really makes this movie work is the main character Olof who comes across so well as the 42-year old vigin.  Olof is rather oafish but sincere and he is in need of something he's never had.  However, the 4-letter ""L"" word he is looking for is love, not lust.  He tries the only method that this bachelor farmer can come up with; he advertizes for a housekeeper.  We've already guessed what the story is after the first few minutes but the characters, the situations, and the contrast of sincerity and insincerity keep us focussed for the entire movie.  The ending is a bit of an emotional roller coaster but it does not disappoint us.  There is a periodic and brief interlude of something in flight that puzzled me until its' last appearance when I realized it was to serve as a barometer of Olof's temperment.

This movie is a bit crude at times which eliminates it from any consideration as a ""Family Film"".  However, I have come to accept in practice rather than in principle that this is what one often gets in European films.  Watch it after the kids go to bed but be sure to watch it!",1220054400,,1587,4.338983050847458
1966540,4,B000127YXI,"Olof is a ~40 year old pastoral farmer who leads a life full of solitude in a sun drenched Swedish village. One fine day, he publishes an advertisement in the local daily seeking a housekeeper (young woman specifically) to help him with the upkeep of his farmhouse. Interestingly, he requests for a picture also.

Olof has a smart alec friend in the form of Erik who doubles up as a gravedigger & horse better. He feeds on Olof's ignorance, under the guider of a good friend; he borrows money that he uses for betting and making a quick buck.

Ellen, a city woman who is presumably running away from some personal problems responds to Olof's classified advertisement and decides to stay at his farm. This marks the beginning of a happy chapter for Olof and a jealous chapter for Erik. Predictably, Olof falls for Ellen, who reciprocates his love back (much to the chagrin of Erik). The story meanders along and in the very end Olof & Ellen are united and Erik is sent packing.

The story by itself does not make the cut. This movie must be watched for the stunning cinematography and Olof `s(Rolf Lassgrd) acting. The long panoramic shots of the lush green Swedish countryside, the close-ups, the real-life dialogs and the wonderful acting make this movie a wonderful movie experience.",1172966400,2,1285,4.727678571428571
1966541,5,B000127YXI,"During the middle nineteen fifties, during the cold war, Sweden was the scenario of airborne drills and military testing, the plane flies carrying weapons, emulating the birds, the real ones, and the wooden man made in the cage...and in The Little Farm (Bates book's that inspired this movie), one man is looking for a miracle, a woman to love. And what a great way to put that, wars are left behind by love stories, because is love what really matters...there is nothing new under solen. Rolf Lassard, face goes alike his horse both are noble, truth, good willed...a man eager to love, a man who believes in friendship. A simple man who can read the heart over no words. Helena Bergstrom is outstanding: pragmatic, but genuine, looking for a life in the farm, where a day of handwork has the reward of a kiss and the beauty of the passion between two people in love. The summer in the Scandinavian interior, the metaphor of the spider Webb, the clock that unwinds at 9:00 PM, the dog that respects the privacy of his master...Seeing Olof taking the horses to drink in Vanderlake...A remarkable work of Colin Nutley, the movie is almost a tranquilizer that conveys meditation, reflex ion and love. And of course...the music! It is almost a crime that there is no soundtrack, cause if you add Paddy Molloney, Gabriel Faur  Requiem opus 48, The Weeping Willows (It's so hard to always loose), Bill Whelan Celtic Heartbeat, and the Scandinavian folk...my goodness, you are in presence of a masterpiece. The sequence of ""read the letter for me..."" is one of the most romantic scenes ever in a movie. This is a movie, if you have had enough of FX and violence, and if you are looking for Arts and The missing romanticism of Roy Orbisson, the voice of Magnus Carlsson, The Chieftains and The Pastoral Scandinavian, this movie is for you!",1142985600,15,1831,4.70404984423676
1966542,5,B000127YXI,"Quite simply, I am nuts about this film.  I don't usually see films more than once, but I have seen this one four times, and still counting.  It never disappoints.  The film is eloquent without being snotty, and it is filled with emotions that are sweet without being cloying.

""Under The Sun"" is perfect.  I wish that all of Colin Nutley's films could be made available in the US.  I would buy every one.",1136592000,5,405,4.405405405405405

1966544,5,B000127YXI,"This wonderful 1998 Swedish story is about love and friendship, captures compassion and is laced with humor.  It takes place in the 50's.  One important fact about this movie was that the casting of characters was superb, and that is what makes a good movie, the characters.

Swedish film director Colin Nutley's Under the Sun is based on a short story of English author H.E. Bates, The Little Farm.  Bates wrote numerous novels and short stories mostly based in English.

Shy and illiterate Olaf, 40ish, lives alone on the farm since his mother died.  Lonely, he puts an ad in the newspaper for a housekeeper.  The requirement in the ad is that the housekeeper be young and he must see a picture.  A beautiful woman, Ellen, answers the ad.

Meanwhile, Olaf has a friend Erik, who is sly, cunning, womanizer, and takes advantage of Olaf financially.  Erik is always up to no good and sometimes works on the farm.

That Ellen falls for Olaf is no surprise, as we learn Olaf is tender, a virgin, and had a dear heart for his mother.  And it's up to Ellen to make the first moves.

Ellen soon learns of the wrongdoings by Erik and warns him.  Erik is threatened that his place in Olaf's life is jeopardized and he  tries to ruin the relationship Ellen has with Olaf by exposing her past.

This movie has beautiful cinematography.  The coloring is unique.  This is a feel-good love story, more on the predictable side.....Rizz",1128297600,,1422,4.62
1966545,5,B000127YXI,"I saw this film awhile ago and plan to watch it again because I purchased it.  This is a beautiful romance.  The setting is unique, 1950 Sweden in the country.  It's semtimental but not sappy.  It's not predictable and formularistic.",1116115200,,233,4.75
1966546,5,B000127YXI,"This is another recent foreign film which just blows anything Hollywood has put out in recent years right out of the water.
Rolf Lassgrd is lovable as the big lug Olof, a 40-something virgin out to fulfill his mother's dying wish that he get himself a lady. But hopelessly shy and awkward, his only method of reaching out is to put an ad in a local paper seeking a live-in maid.
Director Colin Nutley casts his own wife, the wholesomely radiant Helena Bergstrm, in the role of Ellen, the mysterious and enchanting woman who comes to the remote farm to take the job.
Also on the scene is Olof's friend Erik, a cocky young man who has been to America and fancies himself a man of the world. We are thrown off balance at the beginning of the film by Erik's seemingly unnatural interest in Olof's new living arrangements, but by the end of the film we come to understand him and see him for just what he is.
Nutley takes things slow, and what I really enjoyed about this movie was the very low-key and understated way that an erotic tension was allowed to gradually build up between the three. Very refreshing to those of us overdosed on Hollywood's in-your-face, over-the-top directness these days.
Plot complications naturally ensue, but the honesty of the ending will have you cheering.
All I can say is, thank goodness there are still places on this planet where people are not infected with the cynical sarcasm so prevalent in our North American culture today, and are not afraid of genuine emotions. Thank you Sweden!",1088985600,8,1519,4.62962962962963
1966547,5,B000127YXI,"In the beginning of the summer Olof (Rolf Lassgrd), a big farmer, decides to hire a maid through the personals in a local newspaper, but in actuality he is looking for companionship.  Awkwardly Olof approaches the whole matter with difficulty as he is illiterate for which he suffers in silent shame.  Despite his anxiety he goes through the process with the whole village being aware of his add in the personals.  Olof receives two responses, but he responds to the letter from the beautiful Ellen (Helena Bergstrm) as it contains a photo.  When Ellen arrives Olof is extremely nervous as he doubts that she will take the job as a maid.  However, she is willing to take the job without delay to Olof's astonishment.  Olof's friend, Erik (Johan Widerberg), is on the other hand very suspicious about Ellen and what her scheme is as she seems to be out of her environment.  Under the Sun is a warm and sensitive film about insecurities and love as the audience ventures with Olof through his social dilemmas.  This social journey is enhanced by Rolf Lassgrd's amazing performance as the big farmer that has a very limited life experience from outside the farm.  A trademark for Nutley's films is the amazing shots of scenery which are apparent in this film.  One could say that Nutley basically brings summer to the audience as he provides a brilliant cinematic experience in Under the Sun.",1079395200,5,1389,4.7740585774058575
1966548,4,B000127YXI,"Set in the Swedish countryside during the 1950's, UNDER THE SUN is a story about friendship, betrayal, and love. Olof is a simple farmer who has been living alone since his mother passed away nine years old. His only friend, Erik, is a slick twenty-something who takes advantage of Olof's friendship and his inability to read. In an effort for female company Olof puts an ad in the paper for a young cleaning woman (photograph requested). Ellen, an exquisite and beautiful bombshell, answers Olof's ad with a desire to live in the country. She has a challenge ahead of her, as Olof's house is completely dirty. But while she begins her cleaning tasks she is frequently interrupted by the longing stares and conversation of Olof and Erik. Both seem to be unable to resist her charm and beauty. As a result of Ellen, Olof and Erik's friendship is strained. Ellen doesn't believe Erik's actions are altruistic while Erik questions the intentions of Ellen. As the film progresses both men fall in love with Ellen which only complicates their lives.
The cinematography is beautiful. Situated in the Swedish countryside with rolling green hills and winding roads that appear to go nowhere, the viewer is easily entranced with the landscape. Hallmarks of life in Scandinavia are plenty. Set during the summertime the character go to bed at 9pm while the sun still shines. Despite the cinematography the significance of the intermediate shots of fighter jets and planes in the sky lost me. I could not make a connection between those scenes and the film itself. Regardless, UNDER THE SUN is a touching film.",1078963200,4,1599,4.904059040590406

8005445,5,B000127YXI,"3 Things...music, plot and dialogue. A lonely man on a farm seeks companionship. That's it in a nutshell. I love this movie for exactly the reason its protagonist finds it difficult..the isolation. For those of us in an urban setting, the farm in rural Sweden looks idyllic; the dog, horses, ducks and chooks look beautiful clustered around the old farmhouse and outbuildings. There are a couple of sexual things in this movie but they are within the context of the movie and definately enhance its love story aspect. The music is haunting and wistful. The characters are well developed and the language, even through the translation into English, is appropriately poignant and meaningful. I'm a male and I'm not a sook, but I liked this movie a great deal and am happy to have finally purchased a copy after looking for several years.",1379721600,,835,4.846153846153846
8005446,5,B000127YXI,"I've watched this movie twice because I liked it so much. A woman answers an ad placed by
a farmer, and the two people slowly fall in love. I always hate to say too much about movies,
but trust me, this is worth watching. Highly recommended.

Another similar movie that you will like is ""The Polish Bride,"" where a woman escapes from a
forced prostitution ring and winds up at a farmer's house. Watch both.

I heard Andy Griffith explain on a late night talk show that ""Mayberry RFD"" would NEVER be aired on TV today. Andy reminded us that those were tales of a simple people in a tiny town, with Nothing like ballistic males, or femme fatales, cruelly advancing their tokens to Boardwalk and opulent Park Place...like ""Dirty Sexy Money"".  Apparently, our descent into amoral subterfuge and cruel scheming is what we have all come to think of as 'delightful entertainment'.  Andy spoke of a scene with He and Barney Fife sitting on the porch- Barney fuming, as usual, and in silence-which went on for  40 seconds or so. This would NEVER happen on TV today. Well here is such a movie about a very simple farmer who places an ad in the paper for a 'housekeeper'-in fact a secret hope to meet a woman and bring an end to his endless lonliness. Enter a mysterious and stunning woman, just as simple and laconic as our farmer. Add one Swedish rock music fan of the fifites, complete with red 57 Ford convertible, who is actually the only 'bad guy' in the movie..and he ain't so very bad...bad enough, though. A whole lot of us have tried just such a ploy to end our own lonliness. For some of us, who took such a nutty chance, we succeeded. I'll let you watch the movie and see for yourself if there is any hope for true love to take place here. There may not be. But there is nothing wrong with hoping and trying. It's worse NOT to try .
