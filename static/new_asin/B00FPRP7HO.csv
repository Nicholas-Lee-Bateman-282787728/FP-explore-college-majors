Yes - they did 7th Trigger twice, and when you watch this, you'll understand why. (In my opinion, you simply can't hear this song too often!)

OK - WHAT is King's Parade?
King's Parade was a concept started by the band about a year prior to this show.  Tickets on the floor are sold only to men, and the women are allowed in but are banished to the balconies.  (And yes, there is a Queen's Parade version where the positions are reversed.)  The thing about KP is that the guys in the audience are happily whipped into an absolute frenzy of testosterone, and the band feeds off of it and encourages it to the hilt. (A friend of a friend who went to one in Japan said that a lot of guys walked out afterwards in their underwear, having lost or tossed what they had worn going in.)  The songs aren't any different than for Queens, but the energy level is off the charts.  Word of these concerts spread like wildfire in the fan community and EVERYbody wanted to see. Hence, this DVD.

The song list is fantastic; the energy is good, and one can imagine that the stench factor during the show must have been beyond belief. LOL  UVERfans should see KP at least once for the experience.  However, the appeal of this DVD IS mainly for the King's Parade experience. If money is tight, UVERworld will be playing two dome concerts this summer (2014) with a much better stage show and most of the same songs; there is sure to be a DVD of it by Christmas. 'Nuff said.

LIMITED EDITION version:
The LE version of this DVD contains a sizeable chunk of the January 2013 concert at Saitama Super Arena. The Saitama show features a lot of good, new (at the time) music and a decent stage show, but it somehow seems not quite as dynamic as Tokyo Dome or Yokohama Arena. Still if you're into collecting the LE's, this one does not disappoint.  The LE also comes with a photo booklet.
