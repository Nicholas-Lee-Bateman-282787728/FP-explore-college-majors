4651555,5,B005C67UXC,"This collection of Audie's movies are in the top 10 of the best westerns Audie Murphy ever made. Universal and (TCM) Turner Classic Movies, did an outstanding effort of releasing these on DVD and all on one collection. This movie collection consists of (4) four individual disks, no skimping here, no double sides. The covers are also quality done. Audio and video are wonderful. Each movie comes with  it's own special features with the same format outline including movie posters, stills, PR stills, behind-the-scenes stills both US and UK styles. Bed Mankiewicz of TCM introduces each film as if you were watching each show on the TCM channel. How cool is that?

The movies are in color and run on average for approximately 80 minutes each. ""Ride Clear of Diablo"" and ""Sierra"" and are Full framed the other two ""Drums Across the River"" and ""Ride A Crooked Trail"" are not. Of the (4) movies I prefer Sierra which I consider to be the best *Please see my separate review on Amazon. I would highly recommend this collection, you won't be disappointed!

I mentioned earlier that I believe that this collection is part of the top (10) ten movies Audie Murphy ever made. In that list I would include the balance of ""No Name on the Bullet"", Duel at Silver Creek, Cast a long Shadow, The Quick Gun, Tumbleweed and Gunsmoke. In addition, Audie's TV Series ""Whispering Smith is pretty good, but there are some video and audio issues with it although the stories are well written.
Hope this helps.
Blessings,
Phil",1375660800,4,1505,4.758620689655173

4651558,4,B005C67UXC,Audie was a true American hero!  I have enjoyed watching the Audie Murphy Westerns. The DVDs were received in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  Thank You.,1357776000,,163,4.785714285714286
4651559,5,B005C67UXC,"These are some of the best westerns Audie Murphy been in and TCM and Universal did an excellent job of finally releasing these on DVD all on one package. There are four movies with their own respectful disc. The audio and video transfer are just perfect without any flaws I noticed. Each movie has their own features on the disc which would be; movie posters of that movie, scene stills, publicity stills, behind-the-scenes stills, british front-of-house stills and all movies have an intro of Bed Mankiewicz (so it's just like watching them on TCM and seeing the intro, but you can also play the movie without seeing the intro).

All movies are in Color and run for about 1hr and 20mins each. Only ""Sierra"" and ""Ride Clear of Diablo"" are Full frame and ""Drums Across the River"" and ""Ride A Crooked Trail"" are in Anamorphic Widescreen. By the way I don't know if these have any subtitles.

Here is the list of some stars in each movie and all movie of course star Audie Murphy:
-""Sierra"" stars: Wanda Hendrix, Burl Ives, Dean Jagger, Richard Rober, Roy Roberts, John Doucette, Tony Curtis, plus others and is Directed by, Alfred E. Green
-""Ride Clear of Diablo"" stars: Susan Cabot, Dan Duryea, Abbe Lane, Russell Johnson, Paul Birch, Denver Pyle, Jack Elam, plus others and is Directed by, Jesse Hibbs
-""Drums Across the River"" stars: Walter Brennan, Lyle Bettger, Lisa Gaye, Hugh O'Brian, Regis Toomey, Bob Steele, plus others and is Directed by, Nathan Juran
-""Ride A Crooked Trail"" stars: Gia Scala, Walter Matthau, Henry Silva, Joanna Moore, Mary Field, Eddie Little, plus others and is Directed by, Jesse Hibbs

Overall this is an excellent collection of western movies and I would recommend this.",1344902400,22,1702,4.841924398625429
