5832163,5,B00DLX76FK,"How adorable is this show? This is my first time watching Tickety Toc in Chime Time Adventures and I thought it was the cutest thing ever!

My four year old Paige watched it with me and was explaining how the characters to me! The twins Tommy and Talluluah live in the clock and when it's not time for them to give the time, they are off on their own adventures. I think this is a truly original idea for a show.

I remember as a kid being at my Grandma's house and waiting for the time to change to see the little birds come out of the coo-koo clock. I know my kids feel the same way when they watch the Small World tower at Disneyland so I can imagine how magical this concept is for kids.

The characters are fun and unique and the colors and whimsical town they live in make it a place any toddler would want to be! From the cover I wasn't too sure if it was too young for my four and five year olds but they both loved it and watched the entire DVD with me.

Tickety Toc Chime Time Adventures really encourages imagination, problem solving and friendships; things that every mom wants to fill their toddlers minds with!",1378857600,3,1124,4.189814814814815
