Toy train collectors will definitely get a bang out of it too.  All toys and all trains exclusevely delight the eye, like no other I have seen.  It presents the theme that cranes and flat cars are all busy loading and hauling toys for kid's wonderful Christmas....  You see the work going on with the trains and equipment doing the jobs--(all toys too)  The action is sooo terrific, and the amt of toys seen is staggering.  So many different trains of yore are sure to excite even the jaded amongst us!  The set up of the many different ""villiages"" and places of interest keep you entertained completely.  I understand this is provided  by  some private toy train collectors too who are sharing their treasures with us.  Absolutely stunning.  Christmas music with a sort of rustic singer sound from the backgound in simple carols, etc.  All in all--this is a total charm and a Christmas obscurity we all need! Someone has completely outdone themselves with presenting the best possible views ever!!  BRAVO!",1346457600,,1190,4.826732673267327
