4134484,5,B003L16F8G,"I discovered this movie around 2004 when the Shaw Brother film library was purchased by Celestial Pictures.  Celestrial remaster all the movie (about 70 as I can recollect) and did them justice.  Its just unfortunate that it took so long for the American releasees of these timeless classics.  ""Iron Bodyguard"" is a great as ""5 Deadly Venoms"" and ""36th Chambers of Shaolin.""  This is one of Chen Kuan Tai's best performance.  If you love GREAT old school Kung Fu, then you won't be dissappointed.",1362873600,7,496,4.857142857142857

8399178,4,B003L16F8G,"More of a period history film than a kung fu actioner.  There is some action, there are also muskets etc.  The main bad guy is written as much weaker than the hero though, so that pretty much deadens the last one-on-one fight",1462060800,,225,4.333333333333333

8399181,3,B003L16F8G,Iron bodyguard is a movie starring Chen Kuan Tai  as Wang Wu a man who owns a security business who question the authority of the hard line government and Yueh Hua stars as the politician who befriends him and wants him to be his allie. Its a good movie but Chan Cheh has done better movies than this one. The problem i had with it was with the story line but it does have action. The movie was co-directed by Pao Hsueh Li. Lilly Li is playing the sister of the politician.  This enhanced edition looks great and has optional  english and mandarin sound tracks with subtitles. It also has the original trailer and photo gallery.,1434326400,,628,4.396551724137931
8399182,4,B003L16F8G,"DVD Review: As usually, Tokyo Shock does not fail to deliver a quality product. Excellent transfer quality and yaddi-yadda! And it's out of print but at this point not hard to acquire cheap.

Movie Review: It's not one of Chang Cheh's most prominent movies ever but it does deliver some great kung fu action and an okay story. I got it for $5.00 so it was money well worth spending.

Conclusion: 3 1/2 for the movie and 5 stars for the DVD",1421712000,,439,4.341463414634147
