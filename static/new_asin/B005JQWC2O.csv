8475914,3,B005JQWC2O,"I have nothing wrong to say about the anime,I been a fan of the original saint seiya for years. I'm just upset that that I paid more than 20 dollars for a dvd that only has 2 episodes,and no subtitles in english or espanish  I have bought animes less expensive and with more chapters.. I would have given 5 stars if it had more episodes,other than that this is a must have for any saint Seiya fan. This volume has episode 1 and 2  I don't know why they did not put this in the description.",1359504000,3,489,4.083333333333333
