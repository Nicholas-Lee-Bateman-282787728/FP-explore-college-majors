8638712,2,B00I3LOLH6,"Very Very Basic. Definitely a beginners workout. I usually purchase from Amazon however I happened upon this Fit As A Pro at my local thrift store for $2. Had I purchased it new or used on Amazon for anything over $2 I would have been very disappointed.  This video personally just didn't do it for me. I am all for 10 minute home DVD workouts as I have a few of them. Generally I combine the workouts depending on the amount of time I have or make. I would not recommend this DVD for anyone with knowledge of the basics of working out. Also the workouts didn't offer anything new. On a positive note the trainer seemed nice, was professional, and the video is professionally done.",1485129600,,681,4.404761904761905

8638716,5,B00I3LOLH6,"I love that Lauren is barefoot in a living room, because that's exactly where I am when I do this video.  There's no expensive props to buy, proving you can get a killer workout without spending a ton of money. I travel a lot and work long hours- love being able to mix and match the segments to the amount of time I have.",1402704000,4,322,4.03125
8638717,5,B00I3LOLH6,"Lauren will kick your butt in your own living room! I workout 4 days a week combining cardio and weight training at the gym so I won't lie that I was surprised to be sore after this workout. I usually combine all 5 circuits with the warm-up and cool down for a 60 minute full body workout, but on my busy days I'll just choose two or three circuits to get in a quick workout.",1400976000,4,375,4.013333333333334
