8336536,5,B001QVDLJO,"Shout Praises Kids are great resources for exposing children to praise and worship songs that are memorable and easy to sing along with. This DVD has fairly great video quality and really good selection of praise and worship songs with the words on the screen so kids can sing along. These songs compared to the ""You Are Good"" DVD are slightly on the ""wordy"" side however, I don't think they are that complicated that kids can't learn the words. On this DVD, there are no option to turn words off... which I think is okay since you probably want them to sing along. Includes 12 songs ... about 35 min of playing time.  I didn't notice a lot of ""people"" in these videos like there are in ""You Are Good""... just an observation not a fault.  Highly recommend for children's church settings or home church for kids.",1395014400,3,811,4.510204081632653
