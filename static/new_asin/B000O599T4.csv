8182834,4,B000O599T4,"This is a remake of a 1927 film called Somewhere in Sonora.  The story is a hodgepodge of leftover plot lines.  It opens with a couple of cheapskates loath to spend much money on gas, just enough to get them to Bob Leadys ranch.  Once there they switch over to a wagon and horses.  Theyre just in time to flirt with John Bishop (John Wayne) who is practicing for the big rodeo.  This allowed the filmmakers to insert a lot of random footage of a rodeo.  Johns event is the stagecoach race.  Under everyones nose, the competitions stagecoach is sabotaged.  John is arrested without due process and jailed, requiring a jailbreak.  Indebted to the man who frees him, John vows to return the favor by finding the mans missing son.  Lest anyone think too poorly of John, hes cleared of all charges (of which there were none) off screen.  With his bright white horse Duke, John heads to Sonora to find the missing son.  Poor John is saddled with two halfwits who insist on helping him.

This is a typical western made palatable by Duke (the horse who can do anything) and two idiots as the comic relief.  There is a shootout, a knife fight, a firing squad, and the usual obvious bad guy (J.P. McGowan as Monte Black).  For good measure, they even toss in a quickie romance with an ungrateful damsel requiring rescue.

It was good for a few laughs.",1493251200,,1341,4.479338842975206

8182836,3,B000O599T4,"In the early days of sound movies, B westerns were very popular, with hundreds being made every year.  John Wayne started his career in these films, making about one a week.  The movies were about the same-plot, production value, and script being almost interchangeable between them.  To my taste, these films are a pleasent way to spend an hour or so(they are all about an hour long).  I know that many will disagree with me,  but if I have a spare hour I wii watch one.",1359936000,,471,4.430232558139535
8182837,3,B000O599T4,I thought this movie is might have been different to some of his others. I think if you are a John Wayne fan as I am then you might like mto have it in your collection as I now have.,1356652800,,182,3.575

8182839,2,B000O599T4,"John Wayne once remarked that producer Leon Schlesinger's cartoons ""were better than the horse operas he put me in."" The Duke was probably referring to ""Somewhere in Sonora"" (1933) - one of his weakest Warner/Vitagraph Westerns. Wayne's youthful presence, Ted McCord's cinematography and a good supporting cast (including Henry B. Walthall, Paul Fix and Glenn Strange) are the best aspects of this dull ""B"" programmer. More action and far less comic relief would have helped. If you want embryonic Wayne, stick with ""Haunted Gold"" or ""The Big Stampede.""",1284076800,,553,5.295454545454546
8182840,3,B000O599T4,"I've always considered it very strange why Wayne's westerns of the 1930's are not given the same sort of revered status that other western stars like Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers received. Sure they're B movies but so were the films by Cassidy and Rogers. They might not have been as good from a pure technical standpoint, but they weren't awful either.

Wayne is John Bishop who, in a very familiar plotline, finds himself the victim of a frame-up.  This time he's accused of tampering with a rivals coach in a big stage coach race and sent to jail.  His boss (Henry B. Wathall) gets him out of jail and asks him to find his son Bart who was falsely accused of murder and now riding with a notorious outlaw gang.  Bishop is joined by two friends, shorty and Riley as they venture off to Sonora to locate Bart and bring him back home safely.

Nicely done and full of action.  Technically sound with even some comedic elements from the female co-stars Ann Fay and Shirley Palmer.",1114041600,4,981,4.5141242937853105
