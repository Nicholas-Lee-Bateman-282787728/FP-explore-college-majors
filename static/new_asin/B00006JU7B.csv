7970673,4,B00006JU7B,"I think that this Volume of yugioh is pretty balanced, i do whis that it was called trial by Red Eyes with joey and red eyes on the cover because the jeoy duel takes up 2/3 of the disk. the first episode is when yugioh beats (i guess) Monster Kiaba by playing monster reborn to resummon a BEWD to go along with his Celtic Guardian, Feril Imp, and Mystical Elf and destories the third BEWD on monster kiaba's field. Then the next one is Joey V Rex Rapter (really creative names: weivil underwood, rex rapter, mako tsnuesmi, and mai valentine) in Dueling Monkey and trial by Red Eyes. This duel verses the last one i think this one would win because i don't consiter a duel with a goul as a yugi v kiaba duel. He wins with time wizard and wins star chips and red eyes black dragon from rex. pretty good but not the best.",1314316800,,818,4.2165605095541405

Thanks.",1293494400,,244,4.326086956521739
