exactly how to convey the folly and the tragedy of war.",1393891200,4,146,4.653846153846154

This is a passionate call for World Peace on the very eve of war.",1392508800,3,102,4.1
6026187,5,B00FR81YJG,"A superlative choreographic work this; in the context of the time of its original production, prophetic. And we are most fortunate to find it now on DVD as the London edition seems to be no longer available. A gem of a work, this is a beautiful edition at all levels: execution, interpretation, music, lighting. It is a ballet I have longed for in my collection for many years now. Thank you, Joffrey Ballet.

6026188,5,B00FR81YJG,"great, just fine, great, just fine, great, and this is really TOO STUPID to require a specific number of words",1392163200,,110,4.55
8618175,5,B00FR81YJG,"I've seen this ballet at the Joffrey in NYC, and have never gotten over it. I love it. It is innovative, diverse, with modern choreography and music, a labanotation-spawned art project. It's about war, those who convene war and pass it on, with its consequences, to people who respond to the call each based on his/her own ideals and fantasies. But the only winner is death, compassionless, neutral, if patient and gentle. The solos are masterful, as are the ensembles. My favorites are the death solos and the partisan.  Some of the most breathtaking moments are those in which death emerges in the darkness as a face staring into the audience. Not as powerful in the video as on stage, this is still worth seeing, owning, and viewing over and over again.",1504742400,,756,4.7272727272727275

8618177,5,B00FR81YJG,This wonderfully performed ballet is as relevant today was when it was choreographed between the world wars. I'm so thankful that this performance was recorded so that future generations may experience this profound statement about war.

8618179,5,B00FR81YJG,"My involvement with this ballet has been quite long.  I first saw it, by the Joffrey, as a student at the University of Puerto Rico; then, several times more at City Center, NY.  Every time, the impact has been the same: the strongest and painfully still current, indictment of WAR.  It should be required viewing for adolescents and young college students being indoctrinated all over the world by ideologies both of the Left and the Right.  I am so glad I have it!
I forgot to warn you: the recording is put out by Kultur, which means no liner notes of any kind. I  print them from Wikipedia and save them inside the box with  the disc.",1448841600,3,638,4.410256410256411
