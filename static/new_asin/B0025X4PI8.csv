8351248,1,B0025X4PI8,"What a dreadful bio-pic!  Poor transfer, bad acting, poor script...read a bio of Stephan Fost instead!  This one is cheap in price and is a fine example that you get what you pay for.",1437868800,,183,4.352941176470588
8351249,5,B0025X4PI8,"Composer Stephen Foster didn't spend a lot of time down south, sir, only enough to steal ideas for songs. The hits he came up with are all here in this bio-pic and sound wonderful. Douglass Montgomery is Foster, in and out of love with two belles unhappy over his unwillingness to settle down and marry.
""Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me,"" he says in a tender moment with one, then runs off to find a piano, an idea for another song in his head.
""Swanee River,"" starring Don Ameche, is a bigger, more ambitious Foster bio-pic, but not nearly as entertaining.",1374537600,,559,4.490196078431373
8351250,1,B0025X4PI8,"The ratings here from two other reviewers are based on the film itself, which is not a bad little feature. Unfortunately, these reviews do not adequately speak for the DVD release by Alpha Video which does NOT deserve 4 stars.  As with so many other public domain films, Alpha has used an inferior print and produced a deplorable product. This is my last Alpha purchase.  I have been burnt enough.",1362182400,,397,4.6571428571428575
8351251,5,B0025X4PI8,"It's difficult to really rate this film. The story line is compressed, and the acting is amaturistic. It has not aged well, but I got the feeling that all those involved meant well. Foster has had 3 bio pics made about him, none really that authentic to his life, but I guess it's really all about the music. I gave it a 5 out of respect for Foster's legacy. I would recommend this only to Foster fans and collectors of obscure movies.",1280707200,2,435,4.317073170731708
8351252,3,B0025X4PI8,"If you enjoy learning about the history of American music then you need to familiarize yourself with Stephen Foster.  Yes, you've heard of him and are familiar with some of his songs.  I ordered this movie hoping it was the one I saw during the 1970s on television that also starred Al Jolson, but it is not.  However, I still found the movie to be enjoyable and learned more having watched it a second time.  The movie emphasizes his two loves.  Susan, who genuinely cared for him, but married someone else due to his moving to Cincinnati.  The other is a girl named Jane, who according to the movie married him so she could be kept in the latest styles as far as clothing was concerned.  This marriage broke up and Foster ended up living on The Bowery in New York City.  He died an alcoholic in New York at the age of thirty-seven, but during his short life wrote a number of songs that remain timeless to this day.  This is the version of his life this movie presents.  How factual it is as far as his love-life is concerned I really don't know.  I enjoyed the movie and rate it a solid three stars.  The movie is in glorious black and white.",1251849600,,1145,4.299065420560748
