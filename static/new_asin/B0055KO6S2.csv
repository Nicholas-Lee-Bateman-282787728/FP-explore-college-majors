8458439,5,B0055KO6S2,"A unique prison escape film, full of very specific, realistic details and devoid of almost any prison movie clich&eacute;s. The characters all prove more complex then we assume at first glance. Perhaps that's because it's based on a true story.

In fact the cast are all non-pros, and one was actually involved in the real escape plan.

I was lukewarm while I watched the body of the film, but by the end it had an emotional and intellectual effect far more powerful than I expected. There were a couple of illogical moments that made me wonder if the real story was being followed honestly. But, ultimately that didn't really matter. Whatever the blend of truth and fiction this is a tense, powerful, entertaining film, one of the better prison films ever made.

The image on the OOP Criterion is particularly good, so you might want to try to track that down,",1449964800,,861,4.688741721854305
