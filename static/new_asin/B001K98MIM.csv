3663898,5,B001K98MIM,This show is great but beware. I have recived three copies of it and all three had scratched DVDs. The only way I was able to get a full working set was to swap discs from two of the sets.,1237334400,,188,3.725
3663899,4,B001K98MIM,"Overall the first half of Gundam Seed Destiny is simply incredible.  The mobile suit battles in these episodes have gotten even more intense when compared to the same episodes from Gundam Seed.  The story writers also continue to make numerous tributes to the original Mobile Suit Gundam through the designs of various mobile suits such as ZAFT's new mobile suits the ZAKU Warrior and the GOUF Ignited which are based on Zeon's mobile suits and ZAFT's Impulse Gundam which uses the 'Core Fighter' design that was used on the original Gundam.

The story line starts off in the PLANT Amory One which is dedicated to storing and building mobile suits and space ships.  It is attacked by a group of Earth Alliance soldiers in a manner similar to how ZAFT attacked Heliopolis in Gundam Seed.  The objective is the same in that several operatives are to steal several new ZAFT Gundams, the Abyss, Gaia, and Chaos.  While significant damage is done to Armory One it is not destroyed like Heliopolis was.

After the EA makes their escape they are followed by ZAFTs new battleship the Minerva which holds the Impulse, a ZAKU Warrior, a ZAKU Phantom, and several GuAIZ Rs which get destroyed early on.  The story continues to follow the Minerva who plays a key role during the second war.

The primary protagonist of the first episodes is the pilot of the Impulse Shinn Asuka.  In later episodes more focus will be put on the original protagonists but in the earlier ones the focus is on Shinn.

I will admit that I do not like Shinn.  He has a major chip on his shoulder.  It is somewhat understandable since he lost his entire family during the Invasion of Orb.  But he gives off the impression that he is the only one who knows the pain of loss and who suffered from the first war.  He also shows intense dislike for Orb and its people and will even go so far as to discreetly or even not so discreetly insult the current Orb leader Cagalli Atha straight to her face.

Shinn also is shown to have a real problem with authority figures, often ignoring what they say to do his own thing.  I actually find it hard to believe that someone like him no matter how talented could have been assigned to a machine as advanced as the Impulse.  And even as a mobile suit pilot he does not seem nearly as good as Kira was in the Strike.  Sure he can take on numerous opponents who are in Windam mobile suits but he has yet to face multiple Gundam units on his own except briefly during his first engagement.

Overall though I would recommend any fan of the Gundam franchise to purchase this item.",1235606400,4,2577,4.501075268817204
3663900,5,B001K98MIM,"I agree with the previous review. It starts off slow by introducing new characters into the series while giving us glimpses into the lives of the main characters from Seed. I got this set and watched it within 4 days because it was that good. It takes a similar approach to the characters as Seed and it pays homage to the original Mobile Suit Gundam (Zakus and Goufs are present). The first half of the series will make you question who the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys are.

3663901,5,B001K98MIM,Great sequel to gundam seed starts off a bit slow with only a couple main characters from the last series. By the middle a lot more main characters from the last series star showing up and the show gets really good. I would recommend anybody that loved gundam seed to give destiny a shot it will most likely suck you in and not let go till your done. Now im eagerly awaiting the next set next month cant come quick fast enough.,1232409600,,427,4.219512195121951
3663909,5,B001K98MIM,This is an awesome series that picks up where Gundam Seed left off. Does a flawless job of telling another beautiful story from a different point of view. It is a must see for all Gundam fans or mech lovers and I think anyone who enjoys anime will like it too.,1343692800,,260,4.117647058823529
3663910,5,B001K98MIM,"Quick and fast!  The item purchased was just as described!  For those of you who think it's better to buy a ""complete series"" package...it's not a bad idea to buy all the series here on amazon for $130.  I found ONE package (Mobile Suite Gundam Seed) and it was $149 AND it wasn't that good (apparently some of the scenes were cut and what not).  So really, buying them in the 2 series packages like these is the better deal.  Gundam Seed/Destiny FTW!!!!",1316736000,,454,4.421686746987952
3663911,5,B001K98MIM,alright I have seen a lot of mix reviews on the sequel to Gundam seed so here are my two cents worth. the storyline is at least to me a heck of a lot better then Seed I mean yes it seems a little to close to seed but it has a certain thing like dang I had no clue that would happen. for all the hate towards Shin I got news for you if anyone close to you died you would be the same hate the people who did it never blame yourself. I actually hate Kira and am happy he is not in this as much. once more though the earth forces are the bad guys you learn that right away which is great who wants ZAFT to be bad? its great how they put this all together. overall its a great sequel and worth watching unless your huge Kira fans.,1316217600,,725,3.7450980392156863
3663912,5,B001K98MIM,I have seen many animes and gundam series and Gundam seed is by far my favorite anime.  Make sure you watch seed before seed destiny though.,1304640000,,140,4.384615384615385
3663913,2,B001K98MIM,"When the original Gundam Seed tv series came out, it took the spirit of the original MSG series and gave it a modern refresh that proved popular for a whole new generation of mecha fans, and became the shot in arm needed for a tired franchise.  Good characters, original plot twists and cool MS designs.  Gundam Seed became a fan favorite for post 2000 Gundam fans and deservedly so.

All the good work created by Gundam Seed was nearly undone by its rather pathetic sequel, Gundam Seed Destiny.

The series started off on a good note, taking a Zeta Gundam-esque approach by making the former antagonists (Zaft) the new protagonists and introducing a new cast of characters including pilot Shinn Asuka, whose tragic past was directly caused by events of the previous Seed series.

However this new approach to the Seed storyline more or less falls apart about halfway thru the series with horribly written characters, a storyline that loses its way, and a main character who grows increasingly less interesting and unlikeable as the show goes along.

The story gets so off track that the writers (I have no idea what they were thinking) end up bringing back the original case from Seed to become the main characters in the forefront of the story, almost as punishment for what a poor job the original Destiny stars were doing.  This results in a story that concludes almost as a pathetic carbon copy of the original Seed series, and in my opinion, killed the franchise despite its high ratings.  In a way I'm glad this happened and the anticipated Gundam Seed film was never made, because all the lessons learned in this failure led to the creation of a far superior series, Gundam 00.",1298160000,3,1685,4.726962457337884
3663914,5,B001K98MIM,"One of the best anime series' ever made. Love it!!! It's the second season of Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, which is also awesome!",1296518400,,125,4.478260869565218

3663916,5,B001K98MIM,"As the title suggests, this anime far exceeds my initial expectations. Having seen War in the Pocket, Stardust Memories, Gundam Wing and a few others, I'm no stranger to this genre but I had my reservations about this anime due to disc complaints and possible over dramatization.

Thankfully, I did not have disc problems. I did notice a few minor scratches and expected the worse, but they were dragons I never had to slay. In regards to drama, this anime is emotionally charged, but in a good way.

This is a well conceived anime to the point where you will be pulled through a large range of emotions as a result of how the show unfolds. You'll find yourself anxious, frustrated, happy, sad - the whole gambit. I'm not into spoilers, so I'll merely say there were points where I almost looked up what happens online because I couldn't view the episodes fast enough - that's how engaging it is.

If you purchase gundam seed (vol 1 and 2), I (highly) recommend purchasing gundam seed destiny (vol 1 and 2) along with it. Destiny is a direct sequel to seed and equally as good as the first show. I found it highly enjoyable and look forward to any possible new gundam series.",1246320000,,1175,4.533018867924528
3663917,5,B001K98MIM,"The Gundam Seed Destiny Anime Legends, Vol. 1 contain the first 26 episodes of the serie. This serie is very good.",1245542400,,114,4.476190476190476
3663918,3,B001K98MIM,"This series comes right after Gundam SEED. But BEWARE!!! This sequel is FULL of parodies of what happened in Gundam SEED. The main character Shinn can be very annoying and there were some major parts of the plot I thought were really ridiculous. I won't spoil it and say what those are, but I'm SERIOUSLY hoping the rumored Gundam SEED movie fixes these. One romance in particular got seriously screwed by whoever wrote the plot.

I give the series a 3 because, despite all that, it was still pretty good. The animation is beautiful, the JAPANESE voice cast is fantastic and the music is great. (Except for the last opening credit, C'mon!)Not to mention it shows us our favorite characters from Gundam SEED and some of the amazing (and yes, some STUPID) things they do.",1243382400,2,769,4.696296296296296

8314437,4,B001K98MIM,"i really don't like the normal dvd size packaging for anime these days. I know they're trying to save money and plastic and all that but it makes for really crappy sizing. 5-6 discs crammed in a standard dvd case is awful. Pieces break off, you have to remove one disc to get to another, and it scratches them easier. I don't see why that can't go back to the thicker sets like Wing and G came in. Even 00 was released in a big size. other than that i only bought this because it was cheap and I want to have all forms of gundam on dvd. the series is pretty bad. If you're a gundam fan you already know, but of you want a synopsis go to wiki.",1373587200,,642,3.9461538461538463
8314438,5,B001K98MIM,"Gundam seed and destiny are both amongst the best of the gundam series's. If u haven't watched it, go out and get it, it does start kinda slow like most animations.",1368403200,,164,4.32258064516129

8314440,5,B001K98MIM,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1351728000,2,786,4.581560283687943
8314441,5,B001K98MIM,Yea its a really good show. Has a lot a action is great plus the story line is what you spec from a gundam series.,1349740800,,114,3.6
8314442,3,B001K98MIM,"This critic is about the 51 episodes of seed destiny, not just the first part. Gundam seed was one of the best anime series I saw. When I bought seed destiny I had high hope for it beacause of that. Overall, I was disapointed. First, they have try to keep the same recipe. Gundams stolen by the adverse team, 2 peoples with a familie link, I man unknown with a mask ect.. For the first few episodes, I was wondering if it was a remake or a new series. Also, the story is quite confusing, not sure who is with who. It takes 10 episodes to begin to be less confused. Also, Some caracteres we liked a lot in seed aren't what they use to be in destiny. For most of the serie, Cagalie and Athrun can be seen as undecided and weak. The new star gundam pilot is not a likable charactere so it's does not help to like the serie. Sometime the action and story worth 5 stars but most of the time I didn't think so.

So overall it's ok because I wanted to see the conclusion of gundam seed but don't get your hope to high for this one",1347408000,,1023,4.039408866995074
