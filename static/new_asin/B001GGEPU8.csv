8305332,5,B001GGEPU8,"This is a nice wholesome double feature of 2 classic movies from the 1940s. I particularly enjoyed -Road to Happiness- which actually got me choked up. It's about a divorced singer who can't find work, so he takes a job he really doesn't want so he can support his young son. The cold mother is only interested in living the rich life with her new millionaire husband. It's an interesting early view of a broken relationship. The child actor, Billy Lee, is very believable and lovable. The scene where he wants to hear his dad on the radio, but his mother's drunken friends are annoyed will tear you up.
-Double Exposure- is a comedy mystery about a single woman photographer who dreams of making it in New York. A love triangle and a murder ad to the plot in this early view of a woman trying to make it in th working world.",1222041600,2,825,4.398692810457517
