4083606,5,B00388PK7O,"My wife and I picked up a ""Dirty Harry"" DVD and liked it very much. Good entertainment, albeit somewhat violent! In any case, we enjoyed it enough to buy all four of these movies as individual DVDs and I reviewed each DVD for Amazon. You can look them up if you're interested in my opinions. Afterwards, we discovered this 4-pack of DVDs of the same movies. What can I say? I rated all four individual DVDs highly. They were excellent! Perhaps ""Sudden Impact"" was my favorite (5 stars) and ""The Enforcer"" was my least favorite (4 stars), but only by a slight margin. Anyway, this 4 pack is a bargain over purchasing them as individuals and they're all very entertaining movies. If you like Clint Eastwood movies, and Dirty Harry movies in particular, it's a good choice.

4083607,4,B00388PK7O,"I had been waiting to get the 5 Dirty Harry films on DVD.  The previously released sets have been VERY expensive.

If you want the films this is a way to get at least 4 OF THEM NOT ALL 5 at a decent price.

Even though ""The Dead Pool"" is the least memorable of the films still should have been included.

From the original 1971 film ""Dirty Harry"" to ""Magnum Force"" to ""The Enforcer"" to my favorite of the films 1983's ""Sudden Impact"".

All the films are wide screen.

Good to see in a cheaper package each film has an extra with it.

NO chapter search list or film information.  Cheaper DVD package you know that type of thing would not be included.

OK, I am going to complain about these every time I get a DVD with them.  CHEAP & HORRIBLE!!  THESE ARE TERRIBLE.  This DVD plastic case is one of those that has THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  Your DVD's can be easily damaged because of these holes.  Whoever designed them & whoever said this is a good idea WAS NOT THINKING of their customers, just a way to cut corners.
They WANT the DVD's to get damaged so you HAVE TO purchase same films again in the future.",1276905600,8,1114,4.218009478672986
4083608,4,B00388PK7O,"This is reasonable for those who want to collect 4 of the 5 films in one package. After purchasing these, I found Target

4083609,4,B00388PK7O,"The ""4 Film Favorites"" series took on Dirty Harry in this set. There are five Dirty Harry films, but the last film (""The Dead Pool"") is not really worth watching, so this is a great and economical way to experience the Dirty Harry films.

Dirty Harry: Whether taken as social commentary or just an entertaining action flick, this one is a blast. 4/5

Magnum Force: While not as strong as the first, this is a worthy successor, if a little long. 3.5/5

The Enforcer: This one is where the series begins to feel a little tired, but it does have many memorable bits, including the holdup scene in the beginning and Harry's first female partner on the force. 3/5

Sudden Impact: Clint Eastwood's only Dirty Harry film as director, this is an enjoyable entry in the series, featuring one of the series' most famous lines, ""Go ahead, make my day."" The actress who plays a female rape victim has always seemed a little weak to me, but it's still a good film. 3/5

I believe that each Dirty Harry film was weaker than the previous one, but the first four are worth watching. This collection has a great film and three good ones for an unbeatable price. Recommended.",1273190400,57,1157,4.543269230769231

I was able to pick up a copy at Best Buy for only $10 so I can't really complain though.

4083650,5,B00388PK7O,"Had rented these all on VHS back when VCR's were a commodity and since that was a now prehistoric time I won't go on too much about it until the next review but i will say that back then I only liked the 1st ""Dirty Harry"" and thought the others thinned out as they went along.

But now it's 2017, and some consider these DVDs (format that I bought these in) are the new VHS. I like BOTH (DVD & VHS) just as some folks only like 2 types of music (Country & Western), and I'm still not sold on the whole ""we need better and more powerful images so that it will look better than reality"" inflammatory speech.

These films are a set of 4 separate discs including lots of extra features so this kept me a little busy for a while. The result? A good time, make that a great time, no wait a minute it was more like an LIFE-CHANGING time...well, you get the picture, I liked 'em.

In fact I liked 'em better than I remember liking them previously, and not just because these are a newer format than that other format. I'm older now and have a distinct lack (even though I watch a lot of them, so 'lack' might be more like a needy addiction) of detective/police/crime movies in my direct viewing field.

That's the long and short of it or at least the short of it. Dirty Harry delivers and these are fun, well-written movies that I will watch again and again.",1506038400,,1350,4.2007722007722

They are kind of a parody of the extreme kill-everything cop in a way, more of a cartoon than anything, but they're fun to watch. It's kind of amazing that this guy can have like 50 people shooting at him all at once and no one seems to hit him. Good thing all the crooks are such lousy shots.

4083786,3,B00388PK7O,"I'm not complaining about the films or the price. You get all 4 films on 4 separate DVD's for a cheap price (check out Amazon and their third parties). The films are the same as previously released on DVD, not remastered... probably leftover stock repackaged this way.

What I'm complaining about is the way the 4 DVD's are housed inside the single DVD sized plastic case. The middle spindle is extra long and all 4 DVD's are stacked on top of each other. Because of this the DVD's get scratched up quite a bit, it's unavoidable.

Many people mishandle their CD's and DVD's anyways, so it won't matter to them. Other people (like me) try to keep them in good shape, so it's not good enough. Luckily, I bought this as a gift for someone who mishandles his discs, so he didn't care. We watched ""Sudden Impact"" and it was still a good movie, keeps you watching. Even the wives were hooked, and they didn't want to watch it originally.

On the ""Sudden Impact"" DVD there was a bonus film about Clint Eastwood's film as a director. They discussed his films up to ""Million Dollar Baby"". It was a good documentary. Haven't watched the other DVD's, so can't comment on them or any other bonus features.

If you're into cop or vigilante or Eastwood films, then you should see all the Dirty Harry films at least once. You could rent them or purchase a cheap collection like this.",1455408000,,1368,4.504032258064516

None were quite as good as the first, but hey, even Magnum Force and The Enforcer are classics of the cop genre from which all parodies derive source materials. I think that's the measuring stick of a classic. Either way, it's a great collection even if it does omit The Dead Pool for some reason, not that I think it's all that good anyway. Also- as for Sudden Impact- I have a particularly low opinion of this entry. It's just kind of a goofy movie but with a comical number of dead bodies. Seriously, Harry just guns down bad guys endlessly. It's almost silly how the bodies just pile up.",1445558400,4,682,4.3359375
4083813,5,B00388PK7O,"Dirty Harry! What's not to love? This is Clint's best recurring role. The downside is Sudden Impact because of Sondra Locke. If you can overlook her, which is what I have learned to do with some degree of skill, then it's a great movie. In many ways, he is still the kind of cop you wish we had more of. These are an absolute must for any Clint Eastwood collections and a must for most other collections as well. Who can forget the classic line, ""Go ahead, make my day.?"" I can't help but smile just thinking about that scene. Here's to Dirty Harry, the cop who gets the job done!",1445385600,4,580,4.2342342342342345

4083815,3,B00388PK7O,"The Blu-Ray package is fine. I'd give the actual quality of the image and sound transfers 4 stars, because they look good and sound nice. But the films themselves........ man, are they dated, or what? And rather crappy, I might add. For the original Dirty Harry, that should get 4 stars, it started it all, and it's got a decent story and not bad for the time that it was made. Magnum Force is marginally watchable, it already gets a bit silly with its plot holes and taking liberty skipping bits to move the story along. The Enforcer is a joke, it's basically a TV-movie and very poorly done, lazy filmmaking. And then Sudden Impact is barely passable with it Hitchcock-ian tribute and style only watchable because Sondra Locke is lovely in it, but mostly terrible as it is also a TV-movie not done very well, plot skips forward with no rhyme or reason and barely any real set-up or depth to the motivation, stuff just happens to move it along. And I'm only saying positive things around Locke because of what Clint did to her afterwards, acting a total jerk - may be he took Harry's character to heart and lived on it haha. I could never watch the last 2 films again they're so poor. I am amazed that Sudden Impact cost that much to make and made so much money at the box office. What were people thinking? - they were suckered by Clint's and the series' reputation but boy is it an awful film in so far as comparing it other films of its genre that are much more tightly and better constructed.

4083928,5,B00388PK7O,"Times change and the world seems ever more gray where you cant necessarily tell the good guys from the bad. DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is the personification of that tool of logical judgment much to the disdain of his superiors and to the legal system he works within. DIRTY HARRY and SUDDEN IMPACT are the two films that bring the motivations and morality of this character under close scrutiny as he comes full circle with a rather dichotomous approach to his job over the span of time of these two films. When I first saw SUDDEN IMPACT I thought Clint Eastwood had somehow sold out on the underlying essence of the character he had been portraying. He took the realistic base from the first three DIRTY HARRY films (DIRTY HARRY, MAGNUM FORCE and THE ENFORCER) and replaced it with some type of pseudo surrealistic parody that seemed so repulsive it bordered on bad taste to say the very least. However, after repeated viewing it started to grow on me and I actually wanted to watch it over and over. I couldn't get enough of it. It certainly was not the same Dirty Harry but it had a very blunt approach for dealing with crime and criminals. In the first three films the bureaucrats constantly accused Harry of crossing the line yet the audience knew Harry was right and the bureaucrats were just a bunch of crybaby liberals (at least that's what the directors wanted us to think). In SUDDEN IMPACT Clint Eastwood is at the helm. Eastwood proposes a question to the audience: You like crazy? Do you want to see crazy? I'm going to give you crazy. Film making is a business and like a good businessman Eastwood gives his audience what they want. Yet Eastwood is no fool. Without artistic merit this film would have been a failure. Eastwood is playing the auteur filmmaker here and he is very successful at it. This film is way ahead of its time. The fabric of a sane society is being pulled apart. Family values, if you like, are out the window. Eastwood collects the most vile, repugnant and repulsive villains for this film that literally defines the meaning of trailer trash. The Mafia hoodlums at the beginning of the film look like... choirboys compared to the bunch of wacko amusement park crazies he ends up exterminating by the film's end. If Eastwood had not directed this film with his offbeat humor and unconventional style, if he had played it as a straight drama, the critics would have screamed murder. SUDDEN IMPACT is a good film. It's a stand-alone modern day apocalyptic tale delivered for your approval by Dirty Harry. Looking at MAGNUM FORCE there is an attempt to justify the true motivations of the character but that film is not successful thematically and is rather heavy handed. THE ENFORCER's straight forward approach is more satisfying. If America ever had a blunt instrument, it certainly could be Harry Callahan. I can still remember Reni Santoni asking in the original DIRTY HARRY, ""Why do they call you Dirty Harry?"" Now we really know more than ever.",1413763200,,3198,4.692170818505338

Family values, if you like, are out the window. Eastwood collects the most vile, repugnant and repulsive villains for this film that literally defines the meaning of trailer trash. The Mafia hoodlums at the beginning of the film look like... choirboys compared to the bunch of wacko amusement park crazies he ends up exterminating by the film's end. If Eastwood had not directed this film with his offbeat humor and unconventional style, if he had played it as a straight drama, the critics would have screamed murder. SUDDEN IMPACT is a good film. It's a stand-alone modern day apocalyptic tale delivered for your approval by Dirty Harry. Looking at MAGNUM FORCE there is an attempt to justify the true motivations of the character but that film is not successful thematically and is rather heavy handed. THE ENFORCER's straight forward approach is more satisfying. If America ever had a blunt instrument, it certainly could be Harry Callahan. I can still remember Reni Santoni asking in the original DIRTY HARRY, ""Why do they call you Dirty Harry?"" Now we really know more than ever.",1413590400,,3198,4.692170818505338

4083959,5,B00388PK7O,"The Dirty Harry series was always notorious for such lines as: ""Go ahead, make my day."" and ""Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?"" but this series is a little more than just actions films with famous one-liners.
The series is follows a ruthless, tough as nails cop, Harry Callahan, who goes beyond the extra mile to catch the criminals. Along the way he is constantly met with opposition, both from the criminals and his own colleagues. On the surface, these are no more than gritty crime films, but beyond that there are some views which blur the lines between crime and justice, cop and criminal.

Dirty Harry- This will most likely be the most favorite film in the series for anyone. With some great acting, a truly psychotic acting serial killer who is truly interesting, and the struggle of Harry as he tries to stop the maniac, even if he has to go against everything the police department stands for. I feel if I try to go into detail of the movie, I would only under-sell it. If you are only interested in dipping your toe into this series, this is the one to go with. 5/5

Magnum Force- While this movie does ramp up the stakes, it ultimately falls short of the amazing first installment. There are two main issues that really held this movie back for me.
1: Inspector Callahan was more one-dimensional. He wasn't exactly the most colorful character to begin with, but he still showed signs of humanity before this. I just wish they at least spent more time showing the character in different ways then just being a bad-ass.
2: The plot, while interested, was completely predictable. I seriously figured out who all the double-crossers and what their intentions were a quarter of the way into the movie. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it was not treated that way and it did cut away from the intrigue. The best part of the movie was how Harry and the criminals were not very different from one another. It was a nice blurred line that made you question Harry's methods for once.
This is still a very enjoyable movie though and I would still recommend it. 4.5/5

The Enforcer- This is where things go down-hill. While it did fix the problem of Harry being completely one-dimensional, it created a new problem with the criminals being completely lack-luster and almost non-existent. The best scenes were with Harry and his new female partner Inspector Moore. While she might have been annoying at times, their scenes together were entertaining. The film, honestly could have used an extra 20 minutes or so to help give the bad guys more screen time and flesh them out more. They were just a disappointment, especially compared to Scorpio from the first film and the Magnum Force from the second. 2.5/5

Sudden Impact- Honestly, after the disappointment of The Enforcer, I really did not expect much from Sudden Impact. Luckily I was wrong! The series went back to the more slow build up style and was accompanied with an interesting killer and showing Harry as a better character. I can understand how many people would not like the film, but I got just as much enjoyment out of this as I did Magnum Force, and found it just as interesting as Dirty Harry. While I do prefer the feeling of the older two, this did a great job of mixing things up for a series that was on its fourth installment. 4.5/5

If you can find this set for $10 and under, I would highly recommend picking it up. While I am never a huge fan of these bargain packs due to my love of cover art and hatred of horrid disc layout, I never regretted my purchase.
Now, all I can hope is that The Dead Pool (the fifth and final film) is a good installment.",1404604800,,3646,4.526555386949924

The Dirty Harry franchise have a new life and vehicle to the art and career of Clint Eastwood following a string of westerns. Two things I found strange which lower my rating:first, that the last of the sequels (""The Dead Pool"") is not a part of the set, and second was a strange visit from the PC folks at Warner, who, for done reason silenced the ""n"" word in a random note in the first movie (but still showed it written) but left it in spoken later in the same. The inconsistency sticks out like a sore thumb - and leaves it unoriginal in the way it was made and in what was contemporary to the time. Personslly, I don't care for censorship.

4083988,5,B00388PK7O,"Teddy Roosevelt once said ""walk softly but carry a big stick"".....well,  Inspector Harry Callahan did just that but traded the stick for his trademark sidearm, the .44 Magnum.  Clint Eastwood portrayed a San Francisco lawman with a sense of justice that defied conventional rules of law enforcement.  He is the quintessential outsider, the loner with a conscience who , in open defiance to the warnings of his inept superiors, methodically eliminated the evildoers in the most violent and vengeful ways and still managed to keep his badge.  The line between good and evil is blurred  at times and society will judge you harshly if you stray too far--Harry is the vigilante with whom audiences most identified with and we forgive him his trespasses....he simply took care of business!  Clint Eastwood created a character that has become the Icon of the Cops n' Robbers genre; in each film he gave an unforgettable one-liner that typified the mores of the time (1960's-70's).  In this era of Political Correctness it is a stark comparison indeed  to look back at ""Dirty Harry"" in his heyday with his singular approach to law and order and one cannot help but feel some measure of vindication when justice finally prevailes.  Clint Eastwood has since become one of the elite Hollywood Directors yet continues to do things HIS way........gritty, forceful and still walking that blurry line....Enjoy these four winning films---they are guaranteed to ""make your day""",1387065600,6,1460,5.100840336134453

4084035,3,B00388PK7O,"Good way to pick up four Dirty Harry flicks in one shot for a bargain price, but the packaging is not suitable.

The films were each on their own DVD disc (a good thing IMO) but instead of using a four DVD case this is just a single disc case.  Perhaps the inner spindle hub is a little larger than normal (I'm not sure) but in any case all four discs were just crammed together on that single spindle, rubbing into each other, and I was amazed that any of them were in OK shape.  As it turned out three were fine but one is scratched up very badly.

Amazon is sending me out a new set but I assume it will be the same packaging with the same odds of the DVDs being scratched.  I'm hoping that the one disc that is bad in the copy I bought is OK in the new set.",1354492800,18,761,3.8838709677419354

With this collection you have director commentary, which wasn't possible in the VHS era.  If you like Clint Eastwood as much as I do, this one's a keeper.  When you think of all the good movies that followed Eastwood's career; this was his start in Hollywood.  The last Dirty Hary movie, ""The Dead Pool"", is also available for a bargain price if you look for it.  I remember watching a Dirty Harry marathon and discovered Eastwood was the fifth choice for the role.  Frank Sinatra, Burt Renolds, John Wayne and Steve McQueen all turned down Dirty Harry!

4084042,5,B00388PK7O,"Even after forty years ""Dirty Harry"" stands out as milestone in film-making. It had a ""Sudden Impact"" on society. However, my purpose in writing this review is to illuminate truth-seekers as to the real reason for the film's impact, and to debunk the misleading observations in the bonus disc, ""The Long Shadow of Dirty Harry"", about that impact by commentators interviewed therein.

In ""The Long Shadow of Dirty Harry"" film-industry insiders ascribed the impact of Dirty Harry to society's longing for order in the wake of the twin Kennedy assassinations (1963 and 1968) and the 1960's social unrest that resulted in urban rioting, such as the 1967 Detroit race riots. These insiders are either liars or deeply deceived people. If you don't have enough sense to understand that a 1971 film would have been way too late to resonate with audiences in need of catharsis from events four to eight years earlier, than the remainder of what I have to say may beyond your comprehension:

""Dirty Harry"" was a godsend to a society feeling helpless in the face of an onslaught of violent crime unleashed by liberal-leftists do-gooders who castrated criminal justice in America in the late 1960's and 1970's by convincing a gullible public, and Democrat-majority legislatures throughout the nation, that most criminal behavior in America is perpetrated by ""victims"" of society. This theory of criminal behavior led to shorter prison terms, early paroles, and disastrous Supreme Court decisions that rewarded dangerous criminals with freedom if their alleged, fabricated, rights were violated. Now, if you keep this in mind while watching, and enjoying, ""Dirty Harry"", you'll understand the movie completely. You'll easily discern that ""Dirty Harry"" has nothing to do with the Kennedy assassinations, an assertion by leftists to deflect truth-seekers from understanding just how disasterous Democrat/leftists ideology was for the safety of society during the ""Dirty Harry"" era.",1329782400,,1966,5.338709677419355
4084043,5,B00388PK7O,I am not allowed to write cool 20 times and cool is the only word I want to write about this movie set so I decided to add a few more words that were completely meaningless... cool.,1327104000,,181,3.918918918918919
4084044,4,B00388PK7O,"I also bought this set from Amazon, and mine came in a standard flip-case with two double-sided discs inside. The only real complaint is that they couldn't include the last Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool...true, it's gotten bad reviews and would have added a disc to the set, but it still would have been nice to have. Aside from that, the set is very nice: all four films have great transfers, strong sound, and good extras (a commentary for each one!).

Dirty Harry: A rough, no-nonsense cop on the tail of a psycho-killer with changing M.O.s
Magnum Force: Cops who murder perps before they can be put to justice
The Enforcer: Harry and a young female partner against a radical group that has stolen military weapons
Sudden Impact: A woman out for revenge in a small, quiet beach community

The insert also says the movies are remastered. Good price.  However, the DVD case stinks.  The case has a single spindle with all 4 dvd's stacked on top of each other.  Talk about built-in obsolescence and inconvenience!  I've seen plenty of bad, poorly engineered dvd cases, but this one takes the prize. I transferred these dvd's to some good cases to avoid scratching/scuffing from stacking.  Of course, that increased the cost.  Annoying!",1315008000,7,617,4.990196078431373

Just don't get scared when you open the case and only see one DVD!!!! (Like I did).

It is packaged in a case that stacks all four DVD's on top of eachother and give the appearance that there is only one DVD inside. Not to worry though, as none of my DVD's are scratched by this method, and it seems like it was executed well.

The Dirty Harry collection is a GREAT collection by Clint Eastwood, and if you like Eastwood, it's a must for your collection.

First, my set included 4 single-sided DVD discs rather than 2 double-sided ones. I am not sure if that is the new way to package this set but it was a pleasant surprise for me based on the product details posted on Amazon. However, the 4 discs were stacked one on the other on a single spindle which isn't ideal. I plan to separate them somehow to keep them from scratching each other.

Second, all discs do include extra featurettes of some kind in addition to the main film. This only adds to the value of these movies.

Considering I paid less than ten dollars, this set is a great value!",1312502400,8,681,4.223076923076923

I was only disappointed because it doesn't include the fifth and final one in the series, The Dead Pool. However as I found out after I bought this one, there is a collection which includes all five. one other complaint is these four discs are double-sided, something I truly do not like at all. I hope in the future another collection of these will be made which are digitally mastered and single-sided. If so, I'll buy it, these classics are well worth it.",1308096000,,569,4.588235294117647
