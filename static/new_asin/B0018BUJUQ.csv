8269307,5,B0018BUJUQ,"What a great parody movie created by the coal industry!  It is movie made in the same way as ""Spinal Tap"" or ""Best in Show"".  Basically a team of documentary film makers set out to show how burning oil and coal is actually great for the environment and should be promoted as a plant food and will save the planet!  This film had me in stitches the entire movie.  I loved it.  I think everybody should see this for its creative use of irony and sarcasm.  The western fuels association sure can make a great parody!  Thanks for the laughs boys!  Next you should make a film showing how the illegal sex slave trade actually enhances women's rights around the globe and gives a voice to feminism everywhere.",1460332800,,703,4.4375
8269308,4,B0018BUJUQ,"The video is pretty well done. It's nice to see some of the positive aspects of increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere. It is definitely a one sided video, but everything they present is valid. It would be nice if this type of information was more widely known since only the negative aspects of CO2 are given by most of the media.",1374278400,2,331,4.354838709677419
8269309,5,B0018BUJUQ,"The Greening of the Planet Earth is proof positive that man made ""Global Warming"" or man made ""Cimate Change"" is a figment of the New World Order crowd's imagination. The Greening of the Planet Earth is  scientific studies involving plant life that proves that the whole environmental ""scare"" is based on false scientific proof and on false propaganda with an agenda for control of the people and the planet. This is a very informative film. The scientist in the film have impecable credentials in their field and the field of environmental science. This film is a must see for anyone that is interested in finding out the truth about global warming and increased CO2 in the atmosphere.",1347235200,6,686,4.863247863247863
8269310,4,B0018BUJUQ,"I just wish this had been better done. It came off as kind of ""plastic"". The basic message, though, is that the more CO2 in the environment, the better plant life will do. Plant life is how carbon enters the life cycle. This isn't a presentation saying that global warming doesn't exist. It just points out that there are some positives going on with more carbon in the environment. If you don't believe their thesis, just call your local greenhouse and ask them if they use CO2 to make their plants grow faster. Turns out the optimum for plant growth is a lot higher than what we have now and what we are anticipating getting. Ask your florist what that optimum is.

All in all, a worthwhile view and counter presentation for what is generally an unrealistically one-sided discussion of the topic.",1311379200,5,798,4.619718309859155
8269311,1,B0018BUJUQ,"Buyer beware! If zero stars was an option that's what I would have given it. The Greening Earth Society (now defunct) was a public relations front for the Western Fuels Association, an industry group representing mostly coal interests in the Great Plains. One must give the big energy interests credit for creating the unwarranted skepticism about whether or not global climate change is occurring and whether or not it is a positive development. This film and its prequel summarize the coal industry's pro-pollution message about the ""benefits"" of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The science presented in their films is shoddy, bought and sold by industry.",1297123200,,669,5.261682242990654
