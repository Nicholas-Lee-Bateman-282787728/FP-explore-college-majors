In the extras there is a Making Of piece where it is noted that the movie is really about soliders affected by the atmosphere of the bunker and reflecting on their prior acts.  I rather like that it isn't a blood and gore horror film and is more psychological.

2053921,2,B00020X90G,"THE BUNKER

(UK - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital Surround EX

1944: A group of German soldiers take refuge from advancing Allied forces inside a bunker on the German-Belgian border, where they're haunted by what appear to be the restless spirits of a Medieval massacre...

Debut director Rob Green aims for something less exploitative than your average low budget shocker, but he's rather handicapped by Clive Dawson's feeble script, which mistakes 'creeping dread' for 'narrative drive', and the resolution is both confusing and unsatisfactory. The funereal pace and lack of action is further amplified by Russell Currie's dissonant music score, which fails to bolster the visuals in a constructive manner. Still, some viewers will get a kick out of the creepy setting and sudden flashes of violence, and there's an excellent cast, toplined by Jack Davenport (THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY), Jason Flemyng (LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS) and Andrew Tiernan (EDWARD II).

See also DEATHWATCH (2002), a marginally superior reworking of the same basic storyline.",1254960000,,1094,5.449704142011834
2053922,4,B00020X90G,"THE BUNKER is about a group of WWII German soldiers who take refuge from advancing Allied troops in a bunker haunted by their own personal demons of war.  It's an ultimate example of bad karma, with victims of war crimes coming back around to victimize their killers--hence ""The dead don't pick sides.""  I guess you could say that these soldiers should have just taken their chances and surrendered to the Allies!

I liked THE BUNKER, although I admit that not everyone will enjoy this one. It's a little more pensive, with far less obvious interpretations of events and meanings.  For example, I'm not sure how much is going on in the minds of a few demented soldiers and what's really happening on a true supernatural level.  However, I think the not knowing for sure and the multiple interpretive levels are part of the charm here.  Since we get a number of soldier perspectives, rather than what is always one objective view, who knows?  It could be either, both, or any way you chose to analyze it, I suppose. In any case, who cares? It's a war/horror movie, after all.

THE BUNKER is also surprisingly well-acted.  There's also British accents abound!  The word ""bloody"" (although literally appropriate for this movie) is used by a German soldier, while Germans would not use it, of course. I admit that was momentarily distracting on a language level.  However again, I do excuse such movies about soldier ghosts, zombies, etc., from most such things, for obvious reasons.  Besides, it wouldn't be the first time I've watched an otherwise good German war movie in English.

This movie is also not as heavy on the blood and gore as some others in the genre I've seen, such as OUTPOST.  So, all you gore hounds out there may have to look elsewhere on that level alone.  As I suggested earlier, it's really more of a psychological, thinking man's war/zombie movie, if you will.  There are horribly-burned soldiers fighting to the point of unbelievable stamina, a soldier being stabbed by an unseen something or somebody, and more than one example of demonic possession (or just simple insanity).

As you might have already guessed, I am quite partial (and at times even a bit biased) towards war/horror movies.  Some will obviously consider this one total trash (or rubbish, as the British would say), so be warned in advance.  It's about how much you enjoy watching a war/horror movie, while having the freedom to draw your own insightful conclusions from multiple perspectives.  Or, maybe it's just about how much of a cinematic gore hound you are.  From here, I'll let you decide for yourself.

As I said in my OUTPOST review, be sure to watch THE BUNKER, just don't take refuge there!",1233014400,2,2692,4.793926247288503
2053923,5,B00020X90G,"Although Very different from any WWII film. The bunker does a good job of blending history nis horror.

After hearing of an Allied Assualt headed thier way a band of German soldiers take refouge in an abondon bunker. Soon after they begin to suffer from hallucinations and paranoya. But when they start disappering the Fear gets real. It turns out this is the bunker is the site of the Brutal Murder of Several Allied War Prisoners that none other than the main characters shot. Now they are haunted by the memory of those wronged souls and it may be the end of the line for these men.

Instead of horror the film focuses maily on the paranoya and hallucinations of the soldiers to build up tension until the end where the souls take solid form. I was suprised by the film as i had rented it and expected a crappy thrill. I was corrected.",1212192000,2,838,4.435064935064935
2053924,3,B00020X90G,"After reading the synopsis and quite a few reviews I thought The Bunker sounded like a refreshingly different horror flick. I haven't seen a war horror film yet to date and was excited to see what it had to offer. Unfortunately it didn't have too much.

The film is centered around a bunker that is inhabited by an elderly man and a young soldier. As they stand guard inside they hear a knock on the door to find a few soldiers looking for refuge from an enemy attack. Once inside they bigin to learn of underground area that they are warned to steer clear from. The elderly man explains that strange events have taken place down there. From this pointg the film did have a creepy vibe due to the atmosphere which I really enjoyed. The only downside was the story moved a bit slower then I was expecting and never really picked up. I think I was expecting more of a zombie type flick then a psychological thriller. Even at a psychological thriller it didn't have much impact. Overall I would say that this was definately not worth the purchase. It wasn't a complete waste but was definately less then what I expected.",1207612800,5,1117,4.4754901960784315
2053925,5,B00020X90G,This is a great WW2 horror flic. Great story line. If you like WW2 movies and horror movies you will like this. You will watch it again and again.

2053926,3,B00020X90G,"Have you ever put a puzzle together, only to discover that a couple of pieces are missing in the end?  It's a bummer, right?  You can still see the puzzle image with a good understanding of exactly what it is depicting, but it's still incomplete, and you're left feeling frustrated.  That's basically the way I feel about The Bunker.  I know what the film is trying to express, and I even understand the story, but I can't get past the missing pieces that would have made the story much more effective.  Maybe I shouldn't have started watching it at 3 AM, but I just didn't feel that The Bunker made complete sense toward the end, as it never really threshes out some of its characters and ideas.

The pieces seemed to be in place for a pretty creepy film.  It's 1944, and you've got a ragtag group of German army survivors holed up in an anti-tank bunker, with - presumably - American forces all around them and a mysterious, unfinished tunnel system below.  Into this mix you also have some disaffection among the troops and some important questions as to what really happened out in the field just before these guys retreated into the bunker.  Trapped between an enemy without and an enemy within, the viewer is basically poised to find out just what or who will get to these desperate soldiers first.  The fact that two of these soldiers are an old man with a habit of getting things mixed up and a young teenager eager to prove himself just makes things more interesting.  As for those tunnels beneath the bunker, all we know is that they were never finished and that there's something decidedly not good about them.  The old man tells the story of how a large number of bubonic plague victims were rounded up, slaughtered, and buried there on what then became cursed ground.

Naturally, someone disobeys orders and heads down there, and it's not long before the others are down there seeing what they can find.  Soon enough, things start to get really weird.  The men hear strange voices, get separated, and begin to lose it - especially one really gung ho soldier.  Some of them think the Americans are already in the tunnels and are trying to screw with their minds, while others fear they are being punished by the dead for their sins - for reasons that are gradually revealed in a series of flashbacks to the events immediately preceding their retreat into the bunker.  Of course, the dark souls of those once slaughtered there also can't be ignored completely.

With so much going for it, though, the film just sort of fizzles in the final half hour, leaving the viewer with something that barely manages to rise above the level of a bunch of guys wandering through some creepy tunnels.  With all of the hard work that went into the film, especially in terms of generating the creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere, you expect a much bigger payoff that you actually get.

This was not a big-budget film, and it is sort of strange for a bunch of German soldiers to speak English with the queen's accent (but much stranger to see a seemingly random mix of English and German signs displayed at different times), but these issues could have been overcome by a really effective storyline.  Unfortunately, though, The Bunker just doesn't deliver the goods in the end.  It's a good try, though, and is certainly worth watching by anyone with an interest in psychological horror.",1167523200,4,3379,4.662731871838111
2053937,5,B00020X90G,"I throughly enjoyed watching this movie. It give a little twist on horror films being produced today. It was set back in Germany about a haunted bunker during war time. Very scarey and the atmospheric effects were great for a B horror flick. But, I am a B horror fan that loves a good twist once in a while. I highly recommend this film to all horror fans!!!",1167177600,3,358,4.279411764705882
2053938,4,B00020X90G,"""The Bunker"" is a horror film which tries, and mostly succeeds, to be more complex, more ""meaningful,"" than most mainstream horror films. That's not to say it's pretentious (it's not). Nor is it to say there is anything wrong with mainstream horror that is simply trying to entertain (there's not); but ""The Bunker"" is more theme-driven than most horror flicks. Other Amazon reviewers have already talked about the diverse characterizations, which are excellent for the most part, so I won't repeat those comments. Nor will I spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it. Suffice it to say that, among other things, the characters all inform the film's study of human conscience and guilt. To further this purpose, the war is treated not as a mere setting, but also drives the characters and the thematic development: The past seems to literally haunt the soldiers. The bunker itself thus becomes a classic haunted house setting, and is used very effectively to create that visceral sense of ""scariness"" we horror fans love. Also, though, the bunker setting could easily be read as an externalization of interior horror -- a defining characteristic of classical gothic horror. In addition, the film is very successful at evoking a sense of supernatural foreboding, but the viewer can't really be sure whether anything supernatural is actually happening at any given moment. In this sense, ""The Bunker"" reminds me of some of Val Lewton's excellent RKO horror pics from the 1940's (""Cat People,"" ""I Walked With a Zombie,"" et al).

I agree with other reviewers that ""The Bunker's"" low budget is sometimes apparent, but this point is irrelevant to the film's quality. Lewton's films show their low budgets too. So does Carpenter's ""Halloween."" But this fact doesn't make them any less effective. Bottom line: ""The Bunker"" is a creepy, effective, if somewhat imperfect horror flick. (I could only name two or three prefect horror films anyway.)",1160611200,3,1939,5.078369905956113
2053939,1,B00020X90G,"A group of German soldiers finds safety from a U.S. ambush in a spooky shelter in Rob Green's THE BUNKER. The film has a great deal of build-up with its potential supernatural underpinnings, fleeting flashbacks of past horrors, and hints of mistruth. However, THE BUNKER lacks sufficient payoff for the high suspense. It left me dumbfounded and disappointed by the easy answers and quick conclusion.

Populated with a good group of actors whose craggy faces speak to the tough times they've been through, standout performances include Jason Flemyng as a Corporal who may be guilty of the crimes for which he executed others and Andrew Tiernan who recalls the ferocity of Adam Baldwin's Animal Mother from FULL METAL JACKET.

THE BUNKER could have been a claustrophobic tale of the personal demons faced by soldiers who may be projecting their fears and the atrocities of war into the darkness beneath their protective chamber. It might have been a good close-quartered study of the personalities of this group of soldiers. Director Rob Green could have even went in the other direction and created a full out horror tale. Instead, the film feels like an immature work that, while never fully realized in its early stages, rushed headlong into the breach.

I'd recommend skipping THE BUNKER and going for a better war film/character study such as A MIDNIGHT CLEAR or, if you're more in the mood for horror mixed with your tightly-wound characters, rent John Carpenter's THE THING again.",1149292800,3,1485,5.028455284552845
2053940,4,B00020X90G,"Why the negative reviews?  Two reasons.

First, the cover makes it look like a zombie movie, but it's not, so people are majorly upset when it's not what they expected.  Blame that on some brainless executive who took over when the brilliant filmmakers were desperate to get their unique movie distributed.  But don't pass it up if you like suspense - there are indeed people getting killed by who-knows-who/what.

Second, it's low budget as heck.  That means inaccurate uniforms and markings (though most people wouldn't know) and whatever british actors were good and close by.  Americans make movies all the time with people speaking with American accents (yes there is such a thing) playing characters of other countries.  Being british actors doing the same, it sticks out like a fire hydrant to American audiences.  It may be a bad thing to do with a movie, but this one isn't nearly as bad as it seems.

What this movie does have is good acting (from most anyway) and a variety of unique characters.  Each one represents some possible type of person that could have been in the German army during the war.  They range from smart to crazy, aggressive to pacifist.  It is not expected that a random handful of people would have such an even variety (only one of the characters would be close to an average person), but that's part of what makes this movie interesting - you see the interaction of so many character types.

You also get to see things from the main character's point of view.  Not literally all in first person, but through good directing.  A couple of scenes are cleverly arranged to have more than one interpretation when seen alone, making a character's incorrect interpretation seem more plausible, even though the audience knows what is going on.  The movie starts out uncertain, and becomes more clear at the end with a what I think is a stunningly brilliant shot that really sums up the theme of the movie if you know what is going on.",1134345600,16,1962,4.706744868035191
2053941,4,B00020X90G,"""The Bunker"" is rather interesting low budget horror flick which doesn't claim to be a break-through. It has a resemblance with such films as ""Deathwatch"", Korean ""R-Point"" and recent ""Dead Birds"". But here everything happens during WW2 to a bunch of German soldiers falling back through a Belgian forest trying to escape from advancing American troops. They come across a well-fortified bunker and seek shelter thinking they'll be safe there. But as it turnes out it'd be safer in American rangers' hands.
The story-line is rather standard with the necessary set of usual scares and chilling scenes. I guess you won't find anything new for yourself here. But it's a good, solid movie, and I think you won't be disappointed if you like this kind of flicks.
The only thing that annoyed me is that the characters spoke English. I know the film is British/American but people should speak their own language. They are German soldiers, they had to speak German! Producers had to take German actors and make subtitles. But maybe it's just me and you'll disagree :)
Another minus (however not regarding the movie itself) is the box-cover. It's simply stupid. I bought an edition in Germany and it has a fabulous cover (just check amazon.de or watch the image I added). Why did someone decide to ruin the region 1 box?",1132272000,28,1311,4.857142857142857
2053942,3,B00020X90G,"I had a craving for watching a good old fashioned war flick recently, something with a lot of explosions and do or die attitude, so I went ahead and rented ""The Bunker."" The plot sounds like a winner: a platoon of German soldiers hole up in a bunker on the Belgian border during the waning days of World War II. Ahhh, even better! It's going to be one of those ""last stand"" films like ""The Alamo,"" a movie where a small group of hardened troops battles overwhelming odds down to the last bullet! Ten minutes of the film convinced me ""The Bunker"" was nothing like a ""last stand"" war picture. In fact, it's not even the traditional war flick. Rob Green's film is a psychological drama with a healthy dash of horror thrown in for good measure. You know the type. It's going to be one of those movies where the soldiers we see suffer from the memories of what they've done on the front lines. ""The Bunker,"" if the psychological theme holds up, will also be a film that carefully develops each of the characters so as to make the inevitable breakdown all the more disheartening. And that's pretty much what happened by the end of the film. If you're looking for explosions and cartwheeling bodies, look elsewhere.

The plot is about as simple as the single sentence I wrote above. A platoon of seven soldiers arrives in an out of the way bunker on the Belgian border during the waning days of the Second World War. The Americans are hot on their trail, their ammunition is running low, and they don't really know what to do. So they seek shelter in a bunker manned by an elderly local named Mirus (John Carlisle) and a young kid called Neumann (Andrew Lee Potts). Remember, it's 1944 or slightly later, so the Germans have pretty much exhausted their supply of healthy young men and therefore must rely on children and elderly World War I veterans to man the fortifications. Anyway, the soldiers--Corporal Baumann (Jason Flemyng), Sergeant Heydrich (Christopher Fairbank), Lieutenant Krupp (Simon Kunz), Private Franke (Charley Boorman), Lieutenant Corporal Ebert (Jack Davenport), Private Kreuzmann (Eddie Marsan), Private Engels (Nicholas Hamnett), and Lieutenant Corporal Schenke (Andrew Tiernan)--soon discover that they can't leave the bunker. They don't have the ammo and the Americans are closing in. It looks like the war is over for these boys. Unfortunately, it's not. The real horror is about to start in earnest, a horror beyond the reach of bullet and bayonet.

According to Mirus, something evil resides in a network of tunnels beneath the bunker. He tells the soldiers about an old tale from the Dark Ages involving plague victims and a mass grave, insinuating that the spirits of these people walk the tunnels. Scary stuff, but who cares? It's not like anyone has to go down into the tunnels and find out. Until someone realizes that it's quite possible that the Americans could get into the bunker via the tunnels, that is. What follows is a roughly an hour of creepy scenarios unfolding in nail biting detail. Soldiers disappear, hear noises, suffer from hallucinations, and generally fall apart psychologically. The movie keeps throwing in a flashback of some horrific incident involving the platoon, a terrible incident that required them to do something decidedly unpleasant, to give us an idea as to why these guys are coming apart at the seams. As the movie plods along, we also see the individual personalities of the soldiers come to the fore. One of them is, of course, a fanatical National Socialist. Others are scared young men who joined up to find glory in the war only to discover the reality behind the parades and the waving flags. Another soldier is tired of fighting but gamely follows orders until the madness requires him to rebel. In other words, they're types we've seen before in other war films.

I don't know what to make of ""The Bunker."" I liked the general concept of the movie, but the payoff lacks real punch. We never learn exactly what the horror is, if any, that resides in the tunnels. I'm guessing that the stress of losing the war, being outnumbered and constantly harassed by the Americans, and the memories of what they had to do under orders in the heat of combat coupled with the claustrophobic atmosphere of the bunker and attached tunnels is what sends these guys over the edge. I'm only guessing, however, since the movie never tells us one way or the other. Oh well. At least the acting is quite good. You'll recognize quite a few faces in this movie because you've seen them in bigger budget pictures. The actors obviously took roles in this film for the chance to act out a performer friendly script, and all do an excellent job conveying the various dimensions of the soldiers. That's all good, but I was hoping for a bit more horror of the type you can really sink your teeth into. Look at the cover of the DVD case! It shows zombie German soldiers. Where are the zombie German soldiers?!?

Extras on the disc include a commentary track with director Rob Green, a bunch of trailers, a photo gallery, two deleted scenes, and a making of feature boasting a lot of interviews with the actors and spoilers for the film. Since ""The Bunker"" failed to feed my cravings for a traditional war flick (it didn't feed a horror craving, either, not satisfactorily anyway), it's time to find one that will. ""The Dirty Dozen,"" perhaps? Maybe ""A Bridge Too Far"" or ""The Guns of Navarone"" will do the trick. If you're feeling an itch for a war movie, check one of those films out instead of ""The Bunker."" Trust me, you'll be happier.",1129680000,2,5575,4.732510288065844
2053943,4,B00020X90G,"Overall, the Bunker is one of those films that you watch expecting to experience one kind of thrill and end up experiencing another kind. In my case, I fully expected to end up watching a supernatural thriller, instead, I wound up watching a taut and deeply engaging study into group psychiatry and what imagination can do to otherwise rational individuals.

The premise is simple, a group of special infantry in the Wehrmacht, towards the end of 1944, near the Belgian-German border, are forced to seek refuge in an isolated anti-tank bunker. Believing themeselves surrounded, they dig in for a siege and hope in vain for re-inforcements. Inside, the group find a young boy, barely out of school and an aged World War 1 veteran, the enigmatic Mirus. It soon becomes clear that the group are all supressing memories connected to a traumatic event they took part in a year earlier (hinted at in flashbacks). The claustrophic atmosphere of the bunker and the jittery nature of its inhabitants, fuelled by stories of a gruesome medieval legend, lead to paranoia setting in. The group fears that a complex of tunnels under the bunker, has been infiltrated by the Americans. As deaths mount up, their nervousness increases, leading to a dramatic if confusing conclusion.

The film has numerous plus points, the foremost being the taut, quiet tension that is built up and the emphasis on psychological as opposed to visceral shocks. That said, The Bunker did not scare me, only leave me intrigued. All acting, particularly that of John Carlisle playing the mysterious Mirus and Andrew Tiernan playing the psychotic Schenke, is excellent. The sets are superb for the films limited budget and the attention to historical detail is impressive.

But there are flaws, the ending in confusing and faintly ridiculous. The film appears split between implied psychological horror and trying to keep up with a *spoiler* pretense of supernatural elements being present.

Nevertheless, it is a fine film and one that I would thorougly recommend watching for all those with patience and an appreciation of low key horror.",1129075200,,2102,5.066473988439307
2053944,4,B00020X90G,"This movies recieved a lot a low ratings... and understandably so considering what people's expectations have been.

Keep in mind, this is not a war movie and this is not a monster movie.

What it is though, is a low budget movie. And to me, that's a good thing. It means you don't have some Hollywood techie butchering the movie by replacing prosthetics and squibs with CG graphics and special effects.

You have to take that with it's downsides however... it's shot in England with British actors along with their accents... they don't have the money to go all over Europe to get actors for their movie.

This film most reminds me of Day of the Dead, where people are being housed in a military facility and start going crazy because  they're being attacked by something they don't understand and start killing each other.

The most memorable part of this movie is when one of the soldiers takes a shot in the face from a flare gun... if for no other reason, see this movie for that. I've seen plenty of flare gun and napalm special effect in real war movies, but I've yet to see another one so well orchestrated.

Watch this movie because it's a low budget film... and not because of any other preconceptions you have. I'll admit, it's not my favorite movie of all time... but this is definitely one of those things you should try before you say you don't like it.",1125532800,2,1367,4.510121457489879

2053946,2,B00020X90G,"I can't add much to what the others have said here in regard to the overall plot; yes it was a bit disappointing.  What bothered me even more was the total lack of basic military research in to German uniforms or military tactics( though I'll give them kudos for the equipment and weapons which were pretty good ).  These guys were just wearing a hodgepodge of uniforms; SS camo, a mix of SS and Army tunics, a few with SS caps, some with both SS AND Army insignia on their tunics.  There were guys with Corporal and Sergeants  shoulderboards, but with Senior Private chevrons on their sleeves, etc, etc.....

I'm a collector and World War II buff, so lack of any real attention to simple detail kind of killed the movie for me before it even really got started.

The idea of a buncha soldiers going crazy on each other in a bunker is, to me, great fun - but instead it turned into a surreal, meandering series of vignettes that were only loosely connected.

When the end of the movie came, I found myself completely confused. I know that confusion can sometimes be used to enhance the scares in a horror movie - one example of a movie that did that well is Jacob's Ladder. This one was just confusing for no reason. It just kinda ended with no real point.

What you do get is some German soldiers (with British accents) who hole up in a bunker and for the next 90 minutes argue amongst themselves until they all end up killing each other in boring ways.  Obviously the only reason this is even in the horror section is the cover.

Back to the British accents, why would you make a movie about German soldiers and then cast all English speaking British actors?  They even said ""bloody"" like 15 times.  Very distracting.

Not even worth watching for free.",1105833600,6,631,4.589285714285714
2053959,4,B00020X90G,An interesting little movie that was well shot and had some good actors. I especially enjoyed Davenport of Coupling fame. This film was more psychological in its attempt at horror that anything else and brought in some interesting concepts on desertion and the horrors of war all though some of these were not so clear. still it was a refreshing little movie.,1104451200,4,359,4.806451612903226
2053960,2,B00020X90G,"A bunch of German soldiers fleeing allied advancement towards the end of WW2 take refuge in a tank bunker.  The main premise of the movie is that some horrific evil lies in the tunnels that lie unused beneath the bunker.  Despite a promising start and very good acting, you gradually realise there is nothing at the heart of this.  What seems to be occurring is largely self-destruction driven by a bad case of the ""willies"" (no idea how to spell that word).  The acting is decent, but is wasted on a poor plot with inadequate atmosphere and ambiguous loose ends all over the place.  After finishing the film (a chore in itself) you still feel like the key 15-30 minutes of the movie (the ones that would make it make more sense) are missing.  Very poor work.",1104278400,2,759,4.5036496350364965
2053961,1,B00020X90G,"Don't waste your time on this movie wishing that you can see a movie with all these German butts kicked real good by some ghost.  You simply won't find such excitment in this movie at all.
Only if the Germans were as stupid, as coward, and as mentally unstable as portraited in this movie, we wouldn't need to fight them at all 60 years ago and the French or the Jews alone could have taken care of them already.  This has to be one of the worst movie portrait of WWII German soldiers of all time.  Maybe the creators of this movie hated the Germans so much that they have to make all those German chacaters in this movie so stupid and coward.

If you are looking for horror, this is not for you.
If you are looking for a good WWII movie, go watch Saving Private Ryan again.

2053962,3,B00020X90G,"Director Rob Green took a creative risk in filming a movie about German soldiers and using British actors WITHOUT German accents.  Focusing instead on the characterizations, one can forgive Green for this unusual device.

Atmospherically filmed and quite well acted, THE BUNKER is a tale of psychological horror, not zombies or creatures of the undead.  What unfolds is a portrait of men in war, men with fear of losing or dying, men who have committed unspeakable acts in the name of war, and now must pay the price for their grievous acts.  Are there really ghosts?  Notice that all the killing is done by the soldiers themselves.

Some really good performances from a cast of relative unknowns (except for Jason Flemyng and some may remember young Charley Boorman from his father John's fillms).  Not totally a winner, however, as the pacing sometimes slows a bit and the script is somewhat ambiguous in the end.",1100908800,3,915,4.902597402597403

2053964,4,B00020X90G,"...All Unquiet Dead on the Western Front.

Front and center, men! Those of you locking and loading and planning to go into this mission with the expectation of killing undead Krauts---well think again! This is pure psychological warfare, do you get me? Alright! Those of you who want Nazi Zombies and the Living Dead crawling through gas-choked tunnels, step back from the line! Don't be ashamed, men!

Whew. Now that they're gone, let's talk about ""Bunker"", a taut, tightly shot, low-budget little slice of sheer wierd war-story grue set on the Belgian-German border in 1944. The once-reslient German front is crumbling in the face of the Allied onslaught, and a squad of elite German infantry take refuge in an anti-tank bunker, abandoned but for two German privates, one young and terrified, the other the old and half-crazed Private Mirus (played by John Carlisle, who gives the film half its heft with his grisly demeanor and gravelly delivery). The tattered squad is besieged---at first by the imagined American platoon outside the bunker, but increasingly by their own guilt and the voices, echoes, and phantoms within the rotting, creaking bunker itself.

I think it's important to point out that ""Bunker"" is not a goopy, gory zombie-fest---if you're looking for that, look elsewhere. This is an intricate, involved, often quiet but intensely gratifying horrific pyschological tale of dread and horror and the particular hell that soldiers in the field of battle go through. The Bunker itself has its own history, built on the site of a mass grave of those slaughtered during the Black Death. The bunker is for the moment secure, but the German soldiers know they're surrounded---perhaps the tunnels beneath the structure might have ammunition, or a way out?

I have to confess, I loved the ""Bunker"" because I have always been hooked on weird war stories---particularly ghoulish tales of World War II. ""Bunker"" takes that vibe, sinks its fangs into it, and never lets up, so I was hooked from the moment Oberleutnant Heydrich (played rippingly by Chris Fairbank, a veteran actor who was in ""Aliens 3"") forced his way into the bunker. And that's not the only military-regulation acting in this pup-tent: Jason Flemying (the coachman from ""From Hell"" and Hyde from ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) excels in his role as Corporal Bauman, fearful of the advancing Enemy, outflanked by the Enemy within; John Carlisle is a one-man show of cheek-writhing terror..

Half the deliciousness in ""Bunker"" is the fear and loathing concentrated on the tunnels below the bunker: director Rob Green goes heavy on tension and amps up the atmosphere when the squad goes below-ground. For a low-budget flick, the film is amazing well shot, and cinematographer John Pardue treats viewers to a series of claustrophobic tights shots, smooth editing, and delicious, dream-like flashbacks, all culminating in a harrowing finale. This is one of the most professionally, gorgeously shot low-budget films I have ever seen, and the savvy with which Pardue and Green guide the film adds immeasurably to its intensity and terror.

""Bunker"" isn't a zombie film; far from it. The movie succeeds in its gripping, creepy, entirely spooky portrayal of the horrors of war, in the mind, in the flesh, and in the heart; those who savor the quiet terrors of David Twohy's ""Below"" will relish the understated horrors of ""Bunker"". War is Hell---indeed.",1097884800,16,3423,5.125448028673835
2053965,2,B00020X90G,"The cover makes this movie appear to be a night of the living dead zombie style of flick. It is not.

German soldiers take refuge in a bunker while under attack from the ""yanks"". The bunker is out of ammo and supplies. Connected to the bunker is a network of underground tunnels. Stay out of the tunnels, the local legend says they are evil. The soldiers start to loose it. The old guy says he talks to his dead son in the tunnels. Just what the heck is going on. Lots of flashbacks. Are the tunnels haunted, or are the guys just going crazy. I think it's just trapped gases from poor ventilation displacing oxygen making the soldiers looney. And that's about it. The movie is not a horror film, but rather a drama with a little bit of action thrown in.",1096934400,2,753,4.302816901408451
2053966,3,B00020X90G,"WW2 history has always fascinated me.  I am an avid horror fan and the combination of war and horror seemed pretty cool.  In my opinion this film is enjoyable to watch.  It is spooky, the cast is top-notch and the overall feel the director gave the film gave me a very claustrophobic sensation.  I felt uncomfortable durring the scenes of cast hysteria.  The sets were tight, dimly lit and each actor gave a very realistic job portraying scarred, frantic and overzealous soldiers.  There was no gore in it.  This film is basically a pschological thriller.  Leave it up to the imagination type of film.  My one quam with this is that the soldiers portrayed are germans.  The actors casted are all British.  Mix British actors portraying hard core German soldiers you get a German soldier with a British ascent.",1088553600,7,809,4.748201438848921
