5793553,5,B00DDUF4D2,"I have these two sets and found I was drawn in despite having to read my way through.  It doesn't have the added tongue in cheek that American dramas feel compelled to add.  It is involving and very well acted.  I think there was only the one season of the show, very typical outside the US, but wish there were more.  99% of US TV can't begin to compare.  If you like intriguing dramas with compelling interesting characters, yet acting very human and normal, you will like this.  She is a workaholic newspaper crime reporter and you believe it.  I think it is even on some of the membership video sites for viewing.",1396051200,,617,4.407079646017699

5793555,4,B00DDUF4D2,"Scandinavian crime thrillers are my forte, I love them. This new DVD series from Sweden has a promising beginning. We are used to police of all genre involved in the mysteries, now we have a journalist who is a crime reporter who is solving the crimes

.Based on the crime novels by Liza Marklund, this series follows Annika Bengtzon, played by Malin Crpin. She is a reporter for a Swedish newspaper, Kvllspressen. She is a dedicated reporter and loves her work. At the same time, she is married with two small children. The entire family is good looking, and everyone is vying for Annika's attention. Her bosses want her work, now, and her family wants her at home. We are treated to three interesting and sometimes engrossing episodes in this first set. Annika is thwarted at every turn either by her family, her bosses or the police. But she is able to get around them, and in doing so, brings us along for the ride. The storylines are well done, but seem familiar. Nobel Peace Prizes, celebrity deaths and strip clubs are for the ready. Malin Crepin is an excellent actress with a credible work history. There are various well known actors brought in from time to time to liven up the scripts. I particularly liked the scenes and the environment, Sweden is beautiful and we see a lot of the countryside..

5793556,5,B00DDUF4D2,"I agree with the reviewer who said the title alone was a bit off-putting.  I had visions of ""Brenda Starr, Reporter"" with a modern, Swedish twist --but I was wrong.  This is a solid, well-crafted mystery with intriguing scenarios and some fine acting.  Malin Crepin does a very good job at making Annika Bengtzon come alive as a multi-dimensional real woman. The character development and fresh plots won me over as well. Without giving anything away, the first episode was a fascinating insight into the Nobel laureate selection process -- and what can be at stake. I haven't seen anything quite like this setting before.  So, there is a freshness about the series which surprised me.  I recommend it, especially to viewers who have enjoyed other quality Scandanavian mysteries like Irene Huss, Varg Veum, or Maria Wern.",1390003200,12,821,4.963503649635037

I watch a LOT of US & foreign crime dramas.

5793559,4,B00DDUF4D2,"I purchased both of the Annika Bengtzon sets (episodes 1-3, and 4-6). Of the two, I enjoyed the first set better.

Each episode has a unique story line & they are all interesting & kept my interest. Most mystery shows are based on the lead characters being in the police force, I liked that this series took a different take & had the lead character be a journalist.

However, I disliked how Annika's marriage was portrayed in the 2nd set. In the first set, they've been together 10 years & while things aren't perfect, they are making it work (ending up engaged & married). Then, in the 4th episode, the marriage falls apart & her husband cheats on her & falls in love with another woman. It would have been better if episode 1 had started off with them having the falling out, because having it done in episode 4 is just not believable.

I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery show & I know I'll definitely watch it again.",1377475200,9,940,4.421965317919075

5793561,5,B00DDUF4D2,"An excellent Swedish crime drama series, made even more interesting because Annika Bengtzon, a crime reporter for Kvllspressen, has no authority as the police do.

5793563,5,B00DDUF4D2,"I watched this on PBS, liked it so much I was compelled to write a review.  A TERRIFIC crime drama that gets everything right.  The scripts are smart, tight, with pleasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Columbo/dp/B008RJ6TTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Columbo</a>-like ""Of course- that makes perfect sense!"" resolutions (more often than not).  One of those rare shows with few wasted moments or lines, suspense building steadily, inexorably, all the while punctuated with subtle, nuanced glimpses into characters' realities, small particulars of their experience that bespeak volumes about them. I like subtlety, understatement, themes that percolate below the surface nearly unnoticed, multiple strands that seem to effortlessly come together to deliver a powerful and satisfying punch.

The wonderful political series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borgen/dp/B00FC5DGRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borgen</a>, from Denmark, powerfully demonstrated the dynamic, symbiotic relationship between reporters and politicians.  ANNIKA does the same for the press and the police, who often pursue the same leads in tandem but with different emphases and ends.  It reminded me quite a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lou-Grant/dp/6302747031/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lou Grant</a>, though far more sophisticated and painted with finer brushstrokes.  (Another thing I liked about Lou Grant, also evinced by Scandinavian shows in general, is the natural appearance of actors- people of all ages who look like REAL people.)

As an aside, at least one reviewer opined that not enough was shown of the forensic side of things.  I don't mind in the least the omission of the more gratuitous aspects of crime scene forensics evinced by so MANY American shows, e.g., maggots bursting out of victims' eyeballs, etc.  And in the real world, investigators (being human and fallible) more often than not go for the easy, obvious, and most likely, as in Episode 5, Lifeline, in which the jealous, abused wife is assumed to have killed her husband.  Real cases abound of people convicted on the basis of mostly circumstantial evidence (often largely because they're unlikable), sometimes even COUNTER to what forensics suggest, with other, more baffling and abstruse possibilities left dangling, as demonstrated by the Scott Peterson, Cameron Todd Willingham, Jeffrey MacDonald and Mary Surratt cases (of MANY).  ANNIKA exploits these troubling, grey areas to dramatic perfection.

The acting here is superb, the chain of events so realistic and utterly natural you forget you're watching a TV show (great camera work too).  And no gore, no gratuitous elements added merely for dramatic effect/shock value, nothing is there that shouldn't be, that doesn't drive the plot forward.  Annika is imperfect, makes mistakes; she's impulsive at times, ambitious- often steaming ahead when she's less than sure of herself, loathe to admit self-doubts, fears or vulnerabilities.  The show has empathy for all its characters, and for the tragedy that lurks at the heart of crime, yet is utterly matter of fact about both.  A fast-paced, riveting, intelligent series- a pleasure to watch.",1414195200,3,3292,6.090909090909091
5793564,5,B00DDUF4D2,"Tightly-packed, riveting and well-acted drama with English subtitles that hardly distract at all due to the high quality of the shows.

Each show is new and different, but Annika remains and is superb.",1413849600,2,380,5.096774193548387
5793565,5,B00DDUF4D2,"If you enjoy viewing international crime mysteries, this series set in Sweden is a quality production. International mysteries serve as a kind of travelogue and you do see a bit of Sweden through this series.  Annika Bengtzon is a journalist and young mother who keeps getting caught up in the crimes, and danger, as she reports on them.  Loved the first episode the most as it involves the Nobel prize committee and a murder.  This actually felt like a movie with its crispness and quality cinematography.  There are some ""too stupid to live"" moments when Annika continually puts herself in the path of danger.  Like her office-work scenes better than the home scenes with marriage on the brink and kids missing their mother.  If you enjoy international crime procedurals, this series is worth viewing. I like to watch it while on the treadmill as the suspense and story-lines are engaging.  In Swedish with subtitles. 4.5 stars",1413072000,2,929,4.916666666666667

It is a little too ""on the nose"" - a few times I caught myself saying,""Well that sure was a coincidence!"" Everything seems to fall into place for Annika in predictable ways. There are also a few stereotyped characters that were distracting for me (the bitter ""old maid"" in episode 2). I still think it is worth watching, but Borgen IS better!",1405209600,,511,4.473118279569892

5793568,5,B00DDUF4D2,"With almost nothing on American television worth watching, I began buying shows from other countries. This is my favourite. Annika Bengtzon takes on the bad guys with her laptop. The journalist is haunted by her past and tired of coping with her present. Her marriage may be headed toward the rocks; her children don't see much of either parent. But Annika is resilient and persistent when it comes to work. Usually she butts heads at least once with her editor (a great character) and the publisher of the paper, but it's fun watching. I've purchased the second DVD in this series and am viewing it. Please release more! The action takes place in Stockholm and is presented in English subtitles, but it's not difficult to keep up because there are many similarities to English. Trying to catch up with the thriller series by Liza Marklund. Good show!

Update:Many characters solve mysteries, but reporter protagonists can make their own headlines. One Ive come across lately is Swedish writer Liza Marklund who created Annika Bengtzon. Bengtzon works for the Stockholm publication Kvllspressen where she covers the crime beat.

Bengtzon, who is haunted by her past, is only comfortable as she unremittingly pursues her assignments, often risking her own life to get the story. At home where she is the mother of two young children and the wife of an impatient husband, she is much less confident. It is this juxtaposition that makes this series so interesting. She obviously loves her children, but doesnt seem quite sure how to fulfill two full-time jobs; that of parent and reporter. Annika cant seem to please her husband regardless. Her job is just too consuming for him.

At work, although the editor in chief Anders Schyman can be gruff, Annika is in her element. The work, however grim, nourishes her fragile ego. The reasons for this unfold as the series continues. But her pursuit of a story is engrossing. There is another question around every bend in the plot and questions are the best tool of a reporter. Unfortunately, sometimes the answers are dangerous, even deadly.

Liza Marklund is a journalist turned author and goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. Her books have been translated into some 30 languages. It is reported that ABC-TV in the States will debut a series based on her novels starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead of A Good Day to Die Hard. But until then check out the excellent movies starring Malin Crpin as Annika. They are available at Amazon, in Swedish with English subtitles.

Marklund is a deft writer who tells a taut entertaining story with believable characters. She divides her time between Stockholm and Marbella, Spain. The first book in the series is Studio 69 (Studio Sex in the US).",1397606400,5,2721,4.932314410480349
5793569,4,B00DDUF4D2,"34 years old at the time this series was made, in 2012, rising Swedish star Malin Crepin embodies driven, young, thrill-seeking newspaper reporter Annika Bengtzon. While the title of the show as well as its premise suggest a throw back to 1940s film noir when most protagonists were usually either private eyes or reporters, the series is beautifully shot, stylish, and makes great use of colour and locations. While not without cliches, the scripts are exciting and we come to really care about Annika. This is crucial and not a given, for any protagonist, especially female, who sacrifices her home life for professional success (and perhaps to feed her addiction to adrenaline) is bound to come under some criticism for her choices, even in this day and age. It helps that Ms Crepin is beautiful without being intimidatingly so (making her likeable) but it is also a credit to her acting abilities that she so ably pulls this off.

The series gets off to a heart-pounding start when Annika finds herself at the annual Nobel Prize Banquet, Nobels Last Will, where she witnesses a shocking murder. But who is the real victim? Its the story of a lifetime but a gag order prevents her from writing about it. One of the shows ongoing cliches is established early in this episode when Annika appears to be in a very privileged position with the local police, who supply her with important crime-related information at the drop of a hat. Ultimately such details compromise the shows integrity and prevent it from being exceptional. ANNIKA BENGTZON is, however, still highly watchable and ones enjoyment level may be influenced by how forgiving one is towards these dramatic cliches.

Annikas home life is also somewhat predictable, with her husband a bit of a wet blanket the way he fails to put his foot down over Annikas extremely-driven behaviour, especially when it comes to her sharing the load of raising their two children. Speaking of which, how on earth would such a career woman take the time to have TWO children, let alone one. It is hard to imagine Annika Bengtzon taking maternity leave.

This is not to say anyone cant have a successful career and a happy home life, but it isn't easy, and perhaps the show could be a bit more creative when exploring this story arc.

Having said that, ANNIKA BENGTZON is an enjoyable set of six thrillers with a refreshingly different point of view, that of the committed journalist who relishes the challenge of rooting out the Big Story, but who also values the journalistic integrity in reporting the news fairly and accurately to the public.

The second episode, Prime Time, has an Agatha Christie feel to it, as Annika attempts to uncover who, out of ten possible suspects, is the killer of a famous TV host.

Episode three, Studio Sex, is a real pulse-racer and goes a long way into deepening our understanding of Annikas character.

These first three mysteries are packaged as one three disc box set.

The second box set continues Annikas pursuit of journalistic distinction. The three episodes are The Red Wolf; Lifetime; and A Place in the Sun. The last is the most interesting as Annika travels to Costa del Sol, Spain, to cover a story involving a murdered Swedish family. The change of locale is welcome. It should be mentioned that ANNIKA BENGTZON is based on the series of best-selling crime novels by Liza Marklund.

Perhaps it is unfair to compare a relatively straight-forward crime show like ANNIKA BENGTZON with BORGEN, from neighbouring Denmark, but with the latter outstanding show still fresh in this reviewers mind, it is inevitable. After all, Swedish and Danish sound the same to meand will to most North Americans. A subtitle is a subtitle. Still, if you enjoy crime thrillers, watching a beautiful young blonde Swedish woman try to solve the crime is not an unpleasant way to spend ones viewing time.",1397433600,,3872,4.8545454545454545
