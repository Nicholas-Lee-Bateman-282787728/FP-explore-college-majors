3959316,5,B002NKMCBK,"I worked with the deaf and hard of hearing for thirty years from when cochlear implants were introduced until now.  This film, made by the couple's daughter is the process of getting and using CI's, both the success and the failure when introduced to adults.  It should be required viewing for any adult thinking of a CI.",1367539200,,321,4.614035087719298
3959317,3,B002NKMCBK,"There was no closed caption for the narrator, only the subjects in the documentary.  It would have been helpful to a deaf person to get her prospective.",1364774400,4,152,4.62962962962963
3959318,5,B002NKMCBK,"This is an awesome movie, I enjoyed it tremendously, and also got to meet the Taylor""s at our school's deaf event. I would recommend this movie to anyone, who's looking to find out more on Deaf Culture,Cochlear Implants and their pros and cons, or just for entertainment. This is a really good enjoyable film to watch.",1339718400,,318,4.696428571428571
3959319,4,B002NKMCBK,"I saw this on HBO and wished I had recorded it so I could see it again.  As an audiologist, I am very interested in CI and the emotional effects of them.  Great documentary on a couple who had been deaf most of their lives and how the CI affected them.  Will watch again and again!",1325376000,,281,3.982142857142857
3959320,5,B002NKMCBK,"I strongly recommend this movie for anyone who already has a cochlear implants, prospective CI candidates or parents of kids with CI's; and also all Audiologists, whether practicing or are studying to become one, as filmmaker Irene Taylor Brodsky accidentally documented two avoidable CI failures, with Sally's worse than Paul's.

Watch the movie twice: The first time, just sit back and enjoy the story with your entire family, as any member of the viewing public would do so, as that alone rates a good Four Stars. But then, watch the second half again, from the implant surgery forward through 1st stim and subsequent MAP's to the end.

Notice something missing?! HINT: Sally Taylor has personally told me this is the most common question asked at film screenings.

---> WHERE IS THE FOLLOWUP AUDITORY THERAPY? <---

That's right, Paul and (especially) Sally were victimized by their CI center, with poor quality 1st stim, followup MAPs, and the total *lack* of auditory (re)habilitation. This is a superb documentary of an absolute, miserable #FAIL by the Audiology profession, *especially* in Rochester, NY, which has 90,000 deaf residents -- The highest concentration in the world. In fact, both Sally and Paul are retirees from NTID (National Technical Institute for the Deaf; one of eight Colleges at RIT), so it's not like deafness is an unknown quantity among the healthcare profession in the area.

If you already watched the edited version on HBO, buy the DVD anyway as it has an additional 20 minutes that didn't make the cut, mostly of booth testing... But it's worth it to those to both groups -- Hearing healthcare professionals and hearing impaired patients & their families.

I very strongly recommend this film for any and all in the hearing healthcare industry, as it clearly demonstrates how auditory rehab is critical to patient success; and what happens when professionals #FAIL to provide adequate followup care.

I also strongly recommend this film to any and all members of the hearing impaired  (hard-of-hearing, deaf and Deaf) community, as well as to their families.

3959321,5,B002NKMCBK,This movie was wonderful. Really gave a good glimpse into what the Deaf culture is facing and out current times with technology.,1265846400,,128,4.863636363636363
3959322,3,B002NKMCBK,"I loved this show when it was on HBO and wanted to share it with someone who is a candidate for a cochlear implant. I thought it was good to see what the difference could be between expectation, surgical experience, and results. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't play on a DVD player/recorder it must be a DVD player only. Wish I would have known.",1263945600,3,344,4.476190476190476
3959323,5,B002NKMCBK,"I teach American Sign Language at a high school in South Texas, and after seeing this documentary tonight, I cannot wait to show it to my second year students.  It is a documentary that fully explores the emotional and physical aspects of cochlear implant surgery while sharing with viewers an incredible story of love.  The cinematography, the music, the heartwarming family scenes....every detail of this documentary is fabulous.  I also loved the footage of Sally and Paul Taylor from their childhood in the 1940's, including their time at the Central Institute for the Deaf in Missouri.  This is undoubtedly the finest piece I have seen in a very long time.",1262908800,4,661,4.9818181818181815
3959324,5,B002NKMCBK,"My previous review said that I did not order this DVD due to it not being closed captioned. Thanks to a very nice lady I was given the information I needed to know, that it was indeed captioned. I do know that as a person with hearing impairment, I have to be extra careful about the DVDs I do purchase, some of them just are not captioned and thankfully that is getting to be less and less of a problem!

Being hearing impaired myself I was told by my doctor to do some research on cochlear implant surgery. After watching the DVDs and obtaining all the information I could about them I made the decision not to get one. I do just fine with hearing aids and the hearing I still have at the moment, but it will be an option I would be willing to consider in the future. Regardless of my decision, this is a great documentary for anyone considering having the surgery, or who knows someone who will be having the cochlear implant surgery in the future. This DVD, along with the Sound and Fury DVD were very helpful to me.

Thank you very much Sally for helping me out, I will definitely order this DVD now that I have seen it on netflix and know that it is captioned. I just hate spending money on something to find out that I am unable to enjoy it. I have done that before and I know plenty of deaf people who have as well. As for the rude comment made by Mr. Daniel L. Schwartz who seems to know it all, a simple correction would have sufficed. I don't see a reason to stoop as low as grade school name-calling to prove your point.",1262908800,11,1532,4.172297297297297
3959325,5,B002NKMCBK,I viewed this before it came out on a video.  I am purchasing it to show my ASL students how Deaf people see the CI situation in some cases.  I have been waiting for a year for this video to come out and I think that is wonderful that Irene was able to document this journey of her parents through the trials and triumphs of her parent's CI experience.  It is a wonderful video with some important concepts to be taught for hearing people who are studying not only ASL but also Deaf Culture...  Good JOB IRENE!,1259107200,3,510,4.22680412371134
8375103,5,B002NKMCBK,"Excellent documentary on a real Deaf couple, no actors! These are people who elected to have cochlear implants at a mature age, who grew up in an area where schools for the Deaf are heavily oral and concentrated on hearing development. However, being profoundly Deaf, they moved on to American Sign Language and learned their respective professions that way. Their hearing daughter made this film of their journey toward more hearing via surgery. It should be noted that they did not get to hear well enough to understand all speech, only to appreciate environmental sounds and that the journey was difficult for one of them. I had the honor of getting to know them as adults and as a fellow Deaf community member, enjoyed them very much. Highly recommended for all who have questions about the cochlear implant.",1501286400,,812,4.891304347826087

8375105,5,B002NKMCBK,"This will always be one of my all-time favorite films. I think everyone I know should see it at least once in their lifetime! Incredibly educational, & the most beautiful love story ever!",1446336000,,187,4.696969696969697
8375106,5,B002NKMCBK,This is an excellant documentary of the decision and outcomes of Cochlear Implants.  Loved it.  Would recommend it to family's of implant recipients.,1444953600,,149,5.434782608695652

8375108,5,B002NKMCBK,Saw this on HBO a few years ago.  A great story!,1412899200,,48,3.3636363636363638
8375109,5,B002NKMCBK,"I loved Sally and Paul in ""Through Deaf Eyes."" I feel that this documentary shines an important light on the issue of people who have accepted their deafness choosing to get a cochlear implant. I think it's also very valuable to show people that cochlear implants don't always work and don't ""cure"" deafness. It's a beautifully made film. I love this family. I loved this film!",1399939200,,377,4.7272727272727275
8375110,5,B002NKMCBK,My husband and I had gotten it done and really didn't know what to expect. I wish we heard of this movie prior to our surgery so we would have better understanding. Nothing less it was a great movie.,1382227200,,199,4.128205128205129
8375111,5,B002NKMCBK,and this movie educated me on my lack of tolerance for certain noises. Found it very enlightening! Thank YOU so much!,1378857600,,117,4.619047619047619
8375112,5,B002NKMCBK,"Unfortunately the film is not captioned.  However, it is an honest appraisal of this couples experience and thus provides real-life insight into pros and cons to consider when making a decision of this magnitude.  Too often the facts are skewed to represent only the successes of technological advances, without considering individual and human factors.",1373328000,,353,5.518518518518518
