8620418,4,B00G3JOH2O,"This is a well presented basic introduction to Pilates movements and breathing. While I enjoyed the DVD, I found the narration to be out of synch with the movements performed by Heidi Tejada and her student. I found it disconcerting to look at the DVD to check to see whether I'm performing a move correctly [and the voice over is counting out repetitions] to find that Heidi and her student were already done.

The DVD is definitely geared to students new to Pilates and might be simpler than someone who has experience with Pilates would find desirable.",1454457600,,555,4.721649484536083
8620419,5,B00G3JOH2O,"I'm an average person with a ton of Work Out DVDs to choose from. I really like this program! Heidy's voice is so soothing! It's easy enough not to get discouraged, and challenging enough for me to want to master!  I definately felt that the host was really speaking to ladies in a respectful, empathic way that I really appreciated.",1404086400,,333,4.55

8620421,5,B00G3JOH2O,"After going through the Abs workout CD, ( and still working at it ) I decided to see what Heidy's Pilates CD was like. Well, it has exceeded my expectations. Unlike other workouts, I had never tried Pilates, even though my local health club does offer it. I didn't want to do the health club classes primarily because there are too many "" buff "" and younger people taking this class.

Just as in her other CD's, all the components for a successful program are included. Calming music, a thorough tutorial, and an instructor who treats me more like a friend rather than just someone who's paid for a class. This is really important to me. Also, having the CD allows me to go back and replay specific portions, and to concentrate on areas that I feel I need to work on more, all in the comfort of my living room.

An excellent choice. Thank You",1400198400,,842,4.391025641025641

8620423,5,B00G3JOH2O,"This is a good, solid Pilates Routine.  Heidy shows the proper form throughout;
I saw a big improvement in my technique by the second week.

Ms, Tejeda includes a unique bonus, a motivational track option with
positive affirmations only.

This is a good workout if you don't belong to a health club, in my opinion. I've
been doing this at home twice a week, and taking classes at my health club
twice a week.

This winter with all the snow, there when this is all I did, and it kept me in
great shape. Try it, nice host, nice music. Good value.,",1399161600,,545,4.313725490196078
8620424,5,B00G3JOH2O,"Welcome Heidy! A Series with Diversity

 A pleasant welcome to a crowded field. With her calming style, melodic voice-overs and very cool music, this is a very nice alternative to the 'in-your-face' style of dvd's out there. If

you find yourself intimidated by the Jillians and Shaun T,'s, this is the series for you. And as a former instructor at one of the largest health chains in the country, NEW YORK SPORTS CLUBS,

Ms. Tejeda has the cred, too. Now I supplement my in-club classes with this program. Worth the prive",1397779200,,522,4.7032967032967035
8620425,5,B00G3JOH2O,"As a member of The New York Sports Club Chain in the northeast, I've attended many of their yoga and pilates classes
over the last 11 years. Heidy was, hands-down, their most popular class instructor, with a waiting list to attend
her sessions. Her appealing, soothing manner made all feel welcome.

I was delighted to come across her line, The Unleashed Body on amazon. Didn't know these were available. Just bought Pilates
Interpreted- What a great package. Totally loving doing the routine to her 'motivational' soundtrack. Just like being back in the club with this pro! The background music as cool too.

This is pure pilates, not the watered down version that's often the case. Heidy demonstrates the perfect form for every classic pilates move. Attention is given to breathing, stretching and flexibility.

You WILL be exerting yourself, but not in a painful way. Heidy's classes made me get in touch with my inner strength and
got my body sleek and toned in a way that felt natural and enjoyable.

Take my word for it, worth every cent.....Loads cheaper than a gym membership.

Trying Yoga Unleashed next.  AmyW.H.",1397606400,,1122,4.941489361702128
8620426,5,B00G3JOH2O,"I prefer working out to fitness dvd's to stay in shape,
and buy at least 1 new one every few months.
Though I'm a pilates person, I tried heidy's Yoga
dvd because I loved her 2 pilates programs and
wanted more of her programs. This is just great- very
charismatic instruction, no wasted movements.
Adding this Yoga regime 2 or 3 times a week made me
feel more flexible and even leaner with more upper-
body definition.

Ms. Tejada's bonus motivational cue-ing soundtrack
is the reason her programs are easier to stick with
than other programs I've tried in the past. I also really
like her melodic accent.",1389052800,,605,4.601851851851852
