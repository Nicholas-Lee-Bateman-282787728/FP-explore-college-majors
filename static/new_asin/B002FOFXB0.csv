3923588,3,B002FOFXB0,"The Animal, the top of the food chain, the altered beast, there are many nicknames/sayings to describe him but to WWE fans he is known as Batista. This is his story from humble beginnings growing up in Washington D.C., moving around with his family before into weight lifting in high school which lead to him becoming a bouncer at a young age. His meeting with his now ex-wife Angie is discussed which lended some good emotion to the bio and showed a human side of Batista.

He did get into amateur wrestling in high school but didn't get back into wrestling until he went to the Wild Samoan Training Center where WWE Hall of Famer Afa took to him right away as he saw something special in Batista. After being offered a WWE developmental contract, he caught on to it quickly and was called up to the main roster in a bodyguard role, he was still finding his nitch before getting put in the group of Evolution.

His career would take off from there and the rest of the bio goes from his winning the Royal Rumble, to defeating Triple H for the World Title at Wrestlemania 21 along with a side story about how he was injured going into the match. One of the best and most emotional parts was him talking about his friendship with Eddie Guerrero and how hard his death was for him to take. His injury and comeback in '06 are talked about, along with his rivalries with The Undertaker and Edge that spanned much of 2007. Also his popularity with the fans especially those overseas.

Special Features

-Hot Bread and Butter: He talks about a goofy game they played as kids.

-Batista's Rough Neighborhood: More details about how bad the neighborhood was that he and his family grew up in.

-The Biggest Lifeguard at the Pool: Dave's friends talks about them working as lifeguards at a swimming pool and how everyone was awestruck by his size.

-Leviathan, Demon of the Ohio River: He talks about the stuff they had him do to create the Leviathan character in OVW.

-The Animal's New Suit: He and Angie both talk about what happened to a suit they bought for his debut on TV.

-Dave Meets Alonzo Mourning: During a celebrity pool game, Batista talks about how Alonzo knew who Triple H was but not who he was.

-Respect for Eddie: When he and Eddie had a live event match, Batista talks about the crowd not reacting well and Eddie kept trying everything to get the crowd on their feet.

-A Gift for Chavo: We hear how Chavo feels Batista is like family especially since he was so close to Eddie and how he loved to ride motorcycles but didn't have one so Batista bought Chavo one.

-Eddie's Advice: He talks about how Eddie was always good to him and helped him through some very tough times including being there for the birth of his grandson.

-Batista's Lunchbox Collection: His odd collection is shown where he has lots of lunchboxes most if not all in great condition.

Disc 2

-11/28/01, OVW, OVW Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. ""The Machine"" Doug Basham (Champion): Fun to see both of these guys in their earlier days, Basham does his best to take down the big guy but Batista just throws him around the ring a lot. It ends with the Demon Bomb and Batista covers to win the OVW title. 4/10.

-12/15/02, Armageddon, w/Ric Flair vs. Kane: Its Batista's PPV debut and this one features lots of power moves here, both hit some big clotheslines and slams, the pace doesn't really slow down, which is shocking for a big man/big man match. There's interference from Flair that leads to Kane turning up the heat but Flair prevents every pinfall Kane attempts, allowing Batista to hit the Batista Bomb and covers for three. 6/10.

-12/14/03, Armageddon, w/Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels: Due to some injuries this was only his third PPV match and it was a good one that saw the veteran Michaels do everything he could to chop down and frustrate the big monster. Batista is able to beat down Shawn with power moves and worked over his bad back with clubbing blows, Michaels makes his comeback but can't keep Batista down for three. The pace picks up in the closing minutes where Michaels ends up hitting Sweet Chin Music and covers to win. 7/10.

-1/25/04, Royal Rumble, Table Match for the World Tag Team Championship, w/Ric Flair (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz: Nice pre-match promo where Batista makes a comparison between the Dudleys and the hometown NFL team the Philadelphia Eagles. Short but good match here that saw Flair and Batista beat the Dudleys at their own game as Batista hit a spinebuster out of nowhere drilling D'Von through a table as the champs retain. 6/10.

-7/11/04, Vengeance, vs. Chris Jericho: Batista works over Jericho in the opening minutes as he beats up and grounds Chris with a full nelson that Jericho fights out of. For a while Batista dominates the match before Jericho is able to use his quickness however he ends up falling victim to the spinebuster and the Batista Bomb which leads to the three count, Jericho's foot was on the rope but the ref didn't see it. 5/10.

-1/30/05, Royal Rumble Match: Only from when Batista entered the Rumble and where he ended up winning the match to go on to Wrestlemania. 5/10, for what is shown.

-4/3/05, Wrestlemania 21, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Triple H (Champion): Nice entrance by Triple H as Motorhead was there live to play his theme as he came to the ring. The match that launched Batista's main event push, it was a great back and forth contest, especially knowing how injured Batista was coming into the match. Trips bleeds a good amount in this but still gets some good offense in, however this was Batista's night as he was able to counter most of Trips offense and ended up hitting the Batista Bomb and covered to win his first World Title. 8/10.

-6/26/05, Vengeance, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Triple H: More than their Wrestlemania and Backlash matches Triple H really helps establish Batista as a dominate force and a true champion. It better to be watched and enjoyed and its pretty brutal, lots of weapons are used like a barbwire wrapped chair and Batista hits a massive Batista Bomb and makes the cover to retain his title and end this rivalry. 10/10.

-8/21/05, Summerslam, No Holds Barred Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, vs. JBL: After coming over to Smackdown just a bit before this, JBL had focused on taking the title from Batista and this match had the right stipulation as both of these men were way better brawlers than anything else. JBL tries jumping Batista during his entrance and they brawl in the entrance way, into the crowd, Batista spears JBL through the barricade and they finally get into the ring. For the rest of the match some weapons are used including a leather strap and steel steps which are used later as Batista hits the Batista Bomb on them and covers to win. 7/10.

-10/9/05, No Mercy, World Heavyweight Championship Match: vs. Eddie Guerrero: This match was at times more about Eddie trying to prove he didn't need to use any lying, cheating and stealing in this match and that he has turned over a new leaf. This was also during Batista's first and best World title reign where he was on fire and virtually unstoppable. It was actually a good match, just not a spectacular one. Eddie tries using some early wrestling moves to throw Batista off his game, while the animal uses his power even throwing Guerrero off of the second rope easily. Batista also uses a side headlock for a couple of minutes just squeezing on Eddie's head. Eddie does hit a nice frog splash onto Batista's back, then Eddie goes to work on it. Eddie uses a lot of submission moves even a texas cloverleaf. Batista hits a spinebuster out of nowhere to retain his title. 7/10. Good post match with Eddie giving respect to Batista for winning the match. Also kinda eerie this was Eddie's last PPV match.

Disc 3

-11/26/06, Survivor Series, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. King Booker (Champion): In the same arena where he had to surrender the title in January of this year, Batista battles in his last chance against Booker for the title. Batista attacked Booker during his entrance and he took it to the champ wearing him down with power moves and a backbreaker, however Booker hits a hotshot drilling Batista's throat into the ropes. Booker continued to work on the throat and neck of the animal, with chops in the corners and a big clothesline into the turnbuckle. Batista comes back with a jackhammer slam and a side slam, but behind the refs back he gets pulled off the ring apron by Sharmell. Booker takes it to the animal and hits a sidekick for two, in the ring Batista hits a shoulder block from the top and a spinbuster but gets hit with the Book End for two. Booker tried to use the title belt but Batista hits Booker with it while the ref isn't looking and he covers for 3 and we have a new champion. 7/10.

-12/1/06, Smackdown, Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, vs. King Booker vs. Finlay: Good TV main event here as Batista had to fight off two guys who kept double teaming him in the early going. Batista does get some good shots in but both Finlay and Booker keep going for the win, beating up on Batista and each other, however each pinfall gets broken up. The match ends when Batista hits the spinebuster on Booker, then the spear and Batista Bomb on Finlay to win. 7/10.

-4/1/07, Wrestlemania 23, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. The Undertaker: Wow how this wasn't higher on the PPV card I'll never know, they worked so well together countering each others moves on several occasions. These two delivered big time in a match where the animal gave it his all to end the streak but in the end Taker hits the Tombstone to become the World Champion. There aren't enough words to describe this match, watch it an enjoy. 10/10.

-6/3/07, One Night Stand, Steel Cage Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, vs. Edge (Champion): Edge kept trying to evade the animal, but Batista got his hands on Edge and worked him over some. Both make good use of the cage, Edge does gain an advantage after Batista hits the top rope groin first. He removes the turnbuckle pad, can't slam Batista's head into it and Batista hits a superplex on Edge soon after. Both keep battling and Batista just beats up Edge, hotshotting him into the cage wall but only gets a 2. Later Batista goes through the door and his hands touch the floor but Edge goes over the top and lands feet first to retain his title. 7/10.

-10/28/07, Cyber Sunday, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. The Undertaker, Special Guest Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin: A good PPV match between these two, both hit some hard shots and trade power move for power move. Austin doesn't really factor in much as he lets them go at it, Taker works on the arm of Batista who counters by wearing down the deadman with some big moves. The pace is pretty steady throughout the rest of the match and Batista ends up hitting the Batista Bomb, covers and he finally defeats the Undertaker. 8/10.

-12/10/07, Raw, 6-Man Tag Match, w/Triple H & Ric Flair vs. Randy Orton, Edge & Umaga: Its an Evolution reunion, well minus Orton that is and its not a bad 6 man match Flair gets beat up by all three men before making the tag to Batista which leads to dueling spinebusters from him and Trips. Umaga ran in and caused a DQ. 5/10. However Umaga fell victim to Batista's team and they all celebrated the Evolution reunion.

-8/17/08, Summerslam, vs. John Cena: Despite only having a few weeks of buildup these two did bring their A-games, it was power for power though Batista had the edge and showed it by throwing him around the ring, Cena was able to get in some good shots as well. The closing minutes were great as the countered the other's finishers, Batista countered the leg drop from the top and hit a powerbomb but only for two. He then hits the Batista Bomb and covers to win. 8/10.

-12/14/08, Armageddon, vs. Randy Orton: The former Evolution members face off one on one in a decent but not a great match, Randy gains the advantage thanks to outside interference from Manu and Cody Rhodes but they get kicked out by the ref. Orton does target the arm and shoulder, Batista storms back with power moves, but Randy hits a neckbreaker to stop it, then keeps him gorunded with a sleeper hold and a body scissors. Once Batista makes his comeback the pace picks up, Batista counters a Alabama Slam attempt then hits the Batista Bomb and covers to win. 7/10.

While the bio isn't very long, maybe 90-95 minutes the outside of the ring stuff really lended some great insight on the man Batista not just the wrestler. The matches are also good selections, though the Raw 6 man match and a couple of others were kinda just thrown in there.",1332115200,2,12777,4.606687197536296
3923589,5,B002FOFXB0,The video is great for all bauutista lovers. It gives u insight of his early years and how he developed into a superstar for the wwe.,1317168000,,133,4.153846153846154
3923590,5,B002FOFXB0,"I loved it. Not only were some of it best matches on it, but it had personal stuff on there, from WWE friends, childhood friends, and even his mom! I absolutely loved it.",1308096000,,170,4.181818181818182
3923591,4,B002FOFXB0,"I am a wrestling fan and I have been since the 1980s.  The I Walk Alone dvd was full of great matches.  I am not really into anyone's back story, but I understand that if you buy the dvd, you are going to get some of it. Batista has really been involved in some great matches.  I also liked the set because it showed his ups and downs.  Most dvds just focus on the good stuff.  Everyone has lost a match a time or two.  All in all this was a great purchase.  I got it during the ""Wrestlemania 26"" period .  Most of the WWE dvds were on sale.  I bought this for $17.99.  It retails at Best Buy for $29.99.  If you like Batista, you'll like I Walk Alone.",1273190400,2,652,3.900763358778626
3923592,2,B002FOFXB0,"I get it, Batista (at the point of release) is a big baby face in WWE.  I understand that however, I think that it is way, way too early for him to get a 3-disc set for himself.  Why they didn't wait a few more years to put this out so he could get the opportunity for more higher-quality matches is completely beyond me.  Chances are they just wanted to put out another DVD set and since they usually just put out sets of either well established wrestlers (Edge, Triple H, Shawn Michaels) or the bigger, current baby faces within the company (John Cena and Batista).

Granted, there are still several other wrestlers (well-established or not) that deserve to be featured on there own DVD set. The main ones that really come to mind would be:

Chris Jericho
OWEN HART
McMahon Family
The Funks
Sting (Whenever he retires)
Andre the Giant (a real one at the very least)
""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase
Shelton Benjamin
Iron Sheik (just because it would be hilarious)

But until they are able to get this all together, they will continue to put out random DVDs.  Like John Morrison (still too soon)...and they'll probably put one out for like Kofi or something which is pretty disappointing.",1266451200,,1189,4.606635071090047
3923593,5,B002FOFXB0,This dvd is great shipping was great as well as the packing. Amazon has always delivered on time. Shopping with amazon is always a great experience.,1260489600,,148,4.730769230769231
3923594,3,B002FOFXB0,"Did Batista become a bad guy so the title of this DVD in more in line with the character he plays now?

One week he's fighting Randy Orton who is a ""bad guy"" and a couple of weeks later he beat up Mysterio who is a good guy.

The DVD is drawn out and predictable, not like his career.",1260144000,,284,3.7966101694915255
3923595,3,B002FOFXB0,"This 3-disc set got a bunch of negative responses before it even came out.  I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be one of WWE's least successful DVDs.  After watching the documentary program and the bonus matches & footage, I felt kinda indifferent after it was all over.

But here's the thing: ""I Walk Alone"" isn't average because of Dave Bautista.  Sure, he's had a shorter career in the business, and is a soft-spoken kind of guy.  But the real problem is that the documentary is incomplete.

Disc 1 includes the typical WWE-style documentary that you've seen from their other DVD releases.  It begins in a rather strange fashion, as Batista drives around Washington DC, showing how more rundown it appears, instead of the tourist & government complexes you see in the movies or photographs.  You meet his mother, and get to know how the man grew up.  Even though I was kinda lukewarm to this part of the story, it does reveal a lot of who ""The Animal"" really is.  His mother participates, as do a couple of his friends.

I give a tremendous amount of credit to Angie, Batista's ex-wife, for participating in this program.  It's obvious that whatever transpired in their marriage, the two compliment each other enough, while being open about how life on the road made it hard for everybody.  In fact, my favorite footage from ""I Walk Alone"" comes from listening to these two talk about each other.

I don't want to spend too much time on Batista's wrestling career, because there isn't a whole lot I can add to it.  You will learn how Batista tried out at the WCW Power Plant, how Afa of the Wild Samoans trained him, and how his ""Leviathan"" character was born in OVW (the WWE's Louisville training grounds).  Of course, Batista's WWE career is covered, from debuting as Reverend D-Von Dudley's ""Deacon"", to the Evolution days, to eventually becoming the popular singles competitor he is today.

Now, there are two overall surprises I got from ""I Walk Alone"", one good & one bad.  I appreciated was how open Batista is about his family struggles & personal hardships.  Aside from neglecting to mention the alleged affair with Melina even once, --- which is totally understandable as it's really none of our business --- nothing seems off limits.  He even mentions the backstage brawl between King Booker and himself, revealing how new Batista really was at the business.  These kinds of stories are welcome additions to the program.

But here's the unpleasant surprise: the coverage on Batista's WWE career is surprisingly incomplete.  The Evolution faction (with Randy Orton, Triple H, & Ric Flair) is covered pretty well.  Eventually, Batista won his 1st title at the ""WrestleMania 21"" main event from Triple H, and at least part of the lukewarm reception to that match is explained.  Besides, the better story is what happened backstage afterwards.

But you see, the rivalry with Triple H isn't further explored.  How about their two PPV rematches, especially the Hell-In-A-Cell Match?  It would've been nice for Batista to comment on what many believe to be the best match of his career.  The move to ""SmackDown"" in mid-2005 is only briefly shown in clips, with only a few comments on how Batista originally didn't want to move.

After hearing how Eddie Guerrero's untimely death led to a tag team program with Rey Mysterio, his injuries that led to a 7-month absence are discussed.  I liked finding out what happened.  I liked hearing how determined Batista was to get back in the ring.  But then...you don't get much of what happened when he finally returned to the ring.  I can understand not talking about how his PPV comeback was botched (Mark Henry got injured before they could have their grudge match), but then the feud with King Booker is poorly glossed over.

Even the 2007 rivalry with Undertaker is weakly covered.  Aside from their ""WrestleMania 23"" showdown (a favorite for many Batista, Undertaker, & ""WM"" fans), there is practically no mention of their later encounters.  Not even when Batista defended the title against Taker in Washington DC is on the documentary, nor is their final battle with the Hell-In-A-Cell.  Thankfully, the former is on the extra discs.

There is also mention of the 2007 rivalry with Edge.  Again, there are a few interesting bits, like when Edge admits he underestimated Batista's abilites.  But, they don't even mention the ""Vengeance 2007"" final encounter, which was their best work together, in my opinion.  You 'HEAR' how Edge's character kept escaping from ""The Animal"", but you don't exactly 'SEE' it.

And if the documentary is going to show some 2008 footage with the Shawn Michaels feud, how in the world did they forget to show the ""SummerSlam"" match against John Cena?  Even with little build-up, that match was one of the biggest curiosities of the year, and it's a shame that you get in the bonus discs, but no mention on the documentary.

Now...the other day I read a comment where an angry reviewer said, ""Why do some people keep trashing WWE DVDs?  Don't people understand that not everyone collects every WWE disc?""

That's a fair comment.  But how's this: ""Doesn't WWE understand that not everyone has followed Batista's career from start to finish?""  I know it's only been an 8-year run, but I think some people are gonna be confused as to what the heck is going on.  I'm not criticizing Batista's abilities as an in-ring performer or WWE talent.  I'm criticizing WWE for not going deep enough into his career, and for skipping over some of his highlights.
_______________________________________________

The deleted scenes for the documentary are worth a peek.  The one on Batista's lunchbox collection gave me a good smile.  The match selection is about as good as you could ask for from ""The Animal's"" career.  You get to see a couple good matches with the likes of Triple H & Undertaker, while one Edge, John Cena, & Randy Orton get 1 match a piece.  My only criticism would be I would've suggested either the 2007 or 2008 ""Night of Champions"" encounters against Edge, rather than their Steel Cage Match.

Batista's 2005 Royal Rumble victory is on here, starting from when he entered.  #28.  However, Chris Benoit's elimination from the contest has been edited out.  You still see him in a few clips, but there is no commentary or key footage of the man.  Honestly, I don't even remember what happened to him in this Rumble match, so I'm not too mad about it.  I don't personally like censorship of his footage, but since he was a small part of the Rumble at this point in the match, I didn't mind.
_______________________________________________

OVERALL
When it comes to Batista's personal life, ""I Walk Alone"" is very detailed, honest, & compelling.  When it comes to his WWE career, I'm not sure who will be satisfied with this documentary.  The basic highlights are there, and there are a few neat insights that may surprise some.  But it's an incomplete program.  I'm guessing casual fans who don't know every result of every WWE PPV will get into this one the most.

I can't quite recommend the 3-disc set, NOT because of Batista's abilities or career, but because the WWE didn't put enough in their to make it a must-see product for the masses.",1259712000,5,7239,4.816707218167072
3923596,4,B002FOFXB0,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2015

It's a fact that Batista has been one of the biggest & most popular stars (at the time of this DVD release) in WWE's ""Ruthless Aggression"" era for going on 5 years who's had some of the best matches on various PPV cards & television main events as well which says a lot considering how he started his career later & hit the prime of his career in his 40's leading to this chronicle of his career up to this point (as he would eventually leave a little over a year after this) hearing from different WWE personalities along with his close friends & family.

The documentary stars off talking about Batista's childhood growing up in the rough area of Washington D.C. and how he came the ""man of the house"" at an early age before going into his experiences of moving to San Francisco & Virginia. How he started weightlifting in high school & his early ""easy money"" jobs were talked about before going in the story of his relationship with his future (now ex) wife Angie. How Batista got involved with wrestling originally through WCW & later with a WWE Hall Of Famer was talked about before getting into the story behind his WWE developmental character Leviathan. His career starting as Deacon Batista & eventually becoming a member of Evolution is discussed with various important moment being highlighted. How the fans ""chose him"" over Randy Orton leading to his WrestleMania match against Triple H is also talked about including various issues he had going into the match & the incident that happened backstage after the match as well. The documentary got real personal as the negative effect the business had on his relationship with Angie along with Dave's issues with his oldest daughter were heavily discussed. The move to SmackDown (and the ""heat"" he had backstage with the roster) & how close he got with Eddie Guerrero & Rey Mysterio is discussed before heavily going into the popularity he's had with the Filipino community. The story behind him forfeiting the World Title due to injury, his surgery & comeback, and regaining the title from King Booker is discussed before talking about his feuds against Undertaker, Edge, and Shawn Michaels before closing out the documentary on his celebrity status leading into other TV shows & various magazine covers.

DVD extras include bonus stories of Batista talking about a brutal version of ""Hide & Seek"" he used to play as a kid, Batista & his mom telling stories of his rough neighborhood that resulted in 3 different shootings in his front yard, being a lifeguard at the community pool, funny story behind filming a Leviathan segment, what happened when Dave spent $500 on a new suit for his WWE debut, what happened when he went to a pool tournament with Triple H, the moment he gained the most respect for Eddie Guerrero & how Eddie helped Dave's relationship with his daughter, a gift he gave Chavo Guerrero, and the story behind his ""geeky"" lunchbox collection.

Matches Include:
Leviathan vs. OVW Champion ""The Machine"" Doug Basham - Leviathan was shrugging off Basham's offense while easily over-powering him by tossing him around & over the top along with being able to catch him delivering some impactful offense causing Basham to resort to desperate tactics along with being able to take advantage of a mistiming to heavily focus on a body part as Leviathan continued to use his power advantage while allies & enemies of both men attempted to make their presence known.

vs. Kane - This was Batista's PPV debut as both men were throwing big blows matching each other's power such as both sending each other over the top & one man muscling up the other for a slam only for it to be countered into a slam of their own as Batista took advantage of a distraction by Ric Flair on the outside only for Kane to later take a page out of Flair's playbook with a dirty tactic of his own as this was a ultimately big man power match.
Armageddon '02

vs. Shawn Michaels - Shawn attempted to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" using his superior quickness while also getting a shot in on Flair on the outside before Flair was able to regroup Batista where he heavily focused on Shawn's previous injured back with various power moves & strikes along with some dirty tactics in & outside of the ring as they traded momentum countering each other's moves while delivering their own signature offense in a match went back & forth along with telling a good story.
Armageddon '03

World Tag Team Championship/Tables Match w/Ric Flair vs. Dudley Boyz - This brawl started on the floor with Dudleys using the tables to their advantage while double teaming each member throughout the match as Batista was able to briefly dominate each Dudley individually as this really came down to one man getting involved looking for revenge for what happened earlier in the week making the difference here.
Royal Rumble '04

vs. Chris Jericho - Both men traded momentum early before Batista was able to work over Jericho's head & neck area while keeping him grounded only for Jericho to use Batista's own momentum against him while focusing on taking away Batista's power advantage working over the knee & quad area as they went back & forth with Batista being able to keep catching Jericho into his power offense while Jericho continued to use his speed & athleticism.
Vengeance '04

Royal Rumble Match - This is joined in progress as Batista entered at #28 with such highlights as him being dominate with his power, alliances between brand members forming & teammates before one faction member showed that it was ""every man for himself"", and when it came down to the final two where we saw an ending that's only been seen in one previous Rumble that resulted in not only a decision being made to ensure there was a winner along but more memorable for one man sustaining a serious injury...and he wasn't even a participant in the match.
Royal Rumble '05

vs. World Champion Triple H - Motorhead performed Triple H to the ring while he also had Ric Flair in his corner. Batista showed his power advantage early with impactful moves like a high back body drop & powerslam causing Flair to keep getting involved for Triple H to get the advantage. Triple H proceeded to show why he's the ""cerebral assassin"" by focusing on Batista's back using the guardrail along with other moves like the suplex, backbreaker, and spinebuster. The action spilled over the floor where the steel steps came into play for both men to the point where Triple H was busted open as a result with Batista just continuing to just pound on his bleeding head. Flair again attempted to get involved only for Batista to take him out & continued to ""unleash the animal"" as he was able to power out of the pedigree & dominate his way to his first World Championship.
WrestleMania 21
[Greatest Superstars Of WrestleMania]

World Championship/Hell In A Cell Match vs. Triple H - Their third & final encounter for the World Championship with Batista being in control early before hurting his shoulder hitting the post with Batista being knocked off the apron into the cell shoulder first. A biker chain came into play with both men on the end of being whipped & choked with it before Batista got real aggressive delivering a spinebuster between the cell & post busting Triple H open as well. Another weapon was brought into the match in the form of as steel chair wrapped in barbed-wire causing both men to bleed from various parts of the body like the back & face from moves like chairshots, face grinds, powerslam onto it, and even a DDT. Triple H's sledgehammer was brought into play with both men using it to their advantage while the steel steps were also used to punish. This was definitely a brutal battle as both men not only dished out physical punishment but also used the various weapons to not only inflict more punishment but tell a story as well.
Vengeance '05
[Hell In A Cell; Triple H: King Of Kings]

World Championship/No Holds Barred Match vs. J.B.L. - Batista returned to his hometown as champion with J.B.L. attempting to start this fight during Batista's entrance in the isleway and continued throughout the technical area & crowd before breaking through to the ringside area with both men continuing to beat on each other throughout the match using a belt to whip & choke each other along with the ringside steps coming into play in what was a short & physical brawl between both men.
SummerSlam '05

World Championship Match vs. Eddie Guerrero - Eddie had the advantage with this not only being in his home state of Texas but also his birthday as he was able to take Batista off his feet more than once before Batista showcased his superior strength not only slamming Eddie across the ring but also working over his back with repeated slams causing Eddie to try neutralizing Batista's power by heavily working over the back area with different submissions & strikes while also grounding & delivering impactful moves directly onto his back but kept having conflicts over weather to ""lie & cheat & steal"" as they continued to trade momentum throughout the rest of the contest until one man was able to catch the other in a solid encounter that not only told the story of Batista's power vs. Eddie's wrestling ability but also the story of Eddie having an internal conflict in regards to his ""lying & cheating & stealing.""
No Mercy '05
[Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

vs. World Champion King Booker - This was Batista's final title shot against King Booker with Teddy Long added a special stipulation that Booker can lose the title on a disqualification & count out.  Batista took the fight to Booker right away attacking him in the isleway & around ringside before the match started as he dominated with his power to the point where Booker tried to walk away only to be reminded the he can lose his title that way causing Booker to take shortcuts using the ring ropes & other dirty tactics to gain control while taking advantage of the ringside environment before grounding Batista as they traded momentum including Batista using strategy that we haven't seen before such as going to the top rope as the match came down to one man using the other's desperate tactic against him for gain the win.  This match was all about Batista winning the belt back in the arena he had to forfeit it in earlier in the year as it's no secret that Batista & Booker didn't get along personally & even had a backstage fight months earlier as it showed here as they never left ""first gear"" & kept the same pace throughout the entire match to the point where the only measurable reaction from the audience was the finish.
Survivor Series '06

World Championship Match vs. King Booker vs. Finlay - This was shortly after Batista regained the World Championship at Survivor Series with King Booker & Queen Sharmell showing signs of being more serious than they usually are as Batista was the odd man out between both men so he worked over both men & was able to use one against the other before it became every man for himself with each man in control using the same strategy at one point to keep one man inside the ring & the other opponent on the outside with two men at one point trying to form a team to take out the biggest threat only for one man to trying to steal the pin & both men breaking up the other's pin attempt.
""SmackDown!"" Dec. '06
[Batista: The Animal Unleashed]

World Championship Match vs. Undertaker - This was ""Title vs. Streak"" as Undertaker's streak was 14-0 going into this match with Batista taking it directly to Taker with a spear right out of the opening bell as they traded punches before taking it to the outside along with Batista using offense that wasn't typical of him as Taker came back with his trademark offense from Old School to his dive over the top rope to floor as the match intensified with bodies going into the timekeepers area & through the announce table on the outside while both men delivered impactful finishing moves only for their opponent to keep getting up as this ultimately was the biggest threat to Taker's streak & without a doubt the most physical match of both men's careers up to the point.
WrestleMania 23
[Greatest Superstars Of The 21st Century; Undertaker: The Streak]

Steel Cage Match vs. World Champion Edge - Edge made it clear what his intentions were for this match right at the opening bell as he kept trying to escape right away in the opening seconds only for Batista to drag him back in to punish him with his powerful offense such as various clotheslines while also trying to ware him down with submissions like the camel clutch before Edge was able to come back catching Batista in mid-air with a dropkick along with using desperate tactics as both men used the cage to their advantage on more than one occasion in a evenly matched contest.
One Night Stand '07

World Championship Match vs. Undertaker with special referee Steve Austin - Austin was voted in as the special referee due to their previous two rematches not having a winner as Batista attempted the same initial strategy he used at WrestleMania only for it to not have the same results as both were evenly matched having lockup stalemates & using the same strategy of working over their opponents in the corner & pushing the limits of a potential disqualification as Taker would focus heavily on a body part while Batista was able to counter & avoid Taker's offense plus catching Taker into his own power moves as they continued to trade momentum to the point where it took a series of high impact moves to keep their opponent down.
Cyber Sunday '07

w/Triple H & Ric Flair vs. Randy Orton, Edge, Umaga - This was set to be an Evolution reunion at the 15th Anniversary of RAW only for Orton to refuse & setup this match here which was short & told the basic tag team story of one team singling out one opponent isolating him from his partners & keeping him grounded building to the hot tag from his partners as this wasn't anything special past the reunion of Evolution.
""Raw"" Dec. '07

vs. John Cena - This was the first one on one meeting on a big stage between these two who were the biggest current superstars in WWE dating back to winning their first World Titles on the same night as Cena took the easily advantage taking Batista off his feet more than once only for him to come back with power offense including countering one of Cena's signature moves working over a body part using moves & submissions taught to him from his days in Evolution including one that I don't recall seeing from his previously to the point where Cena showed effects during his own offense as they continued to trade momentum executing each other's trademark offensive maneuvers & countering their opponents to the point where it took a series of impactful offense to not only put their opponent down but also out of action following this match.
SummerSlam '08

vs. Randy Orton - Orton came out with Cody Rhodes & Manu with him only for them to be sent to the back in the opening minutes after getting involved allowing Orton to get the advantage heavily working over a body part as Batista attempted to fight back using his power only for Orton to be able to counter & focus on another part of Batista's body with various moves & direct strikes as they traded momentum with series of offense & counters from a superplex to DDT to spinebuster as it ultimately came down to one man being about to counter the other's move into one of their own that the other couldn't get up from.
Armageddon '08

In the end, this was exactly what I stated in the beginning as this is strictly a DVD for Batista fans as far as the documentary goes because the fact is that Batista hasn't had a long career so there weren't many stories to tell but at least they tried to make up for it by getting deep in his personal life & were honest with various subjects like his backstage heat & his attitude when he came to SmackDown. As for the match selection, they got most of Batista's best performances on here but there are some matches on here just to document a moment or a stage in his career along with some other flops that could have easily been replaced with a better quality match or important moment from his career. In the end, if your already a big fan of Batista then odds are your going to get this anyways but if you aren't then I would suggest to get this set based off the match selection more than anything else because the documentary was lacking due to Batista not having a long in-ring career.",1258329600,8,16593,4.628396739130435
3923597,5,B002FOFXB0,"This is a fantastic DVD for one of the best superstars in WWE today, The Animal Batista. Tons of great moments and matches are included, like his classic matches with Triple H, Undertaker, and his epic encounter with John Cena. However other great matches are missing, like his great series of matches with Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho in 2008. They are only briefly mentioned in the documentary. I would have also included the Last Man Standing match or Hell in a Cell with the Undertaker, the Punjabi Prison match with The Great Khali, the second Night of Champions match with Edge, and his world title match with CM Punk at The Great American Bash.

But in the end, this is still a must-have DVD for all die-hard WWE fans!",1257465600,,729,4.607692307692307
3923598,5,B002FOFXB0,"I will preface this review by saying that I have been a Batista fan since early in 2002. I discovered him through Ohio Valley Wrestling, and was instantly hooked with his captivating character. This is an unbiased review however, and not a case of a fangirl screaming over a loved wrestler.

What I liked the most about the DVD was Disc One, the interviews with people who know Batista the best. He has always struck me as a very humble man, and he certainly comes across that way in the interviews. When you listen to him speak, he gives credit where credit is due. It isn't only his interviews that I enjoyed, it was great seeing the people who are so important in his life. As I said, I've been a fan of Batista since the very early days, and seeing Jonathan Meisner, a person I used to interact with on Batista's official message board was interesting. Hearing many of the stories from his book ""Batista Unleashed"" told in person was enjoyable. Also, there are pictures shown on this DVD that I do not remember from the book.

Disc Two and Three feature matches, and even though I had seen all of the matches before, it was nice seeing them again all in one place. I almost wish they had included more OVW matches, in particular the match where he saved Ric Flair's son David from John Cena and Sean O'Haire. Two other older matches that were included were awesome, Batista vs Shawn Michaels from Armageddon 2003, and Batista vs Jericho from Vengeance 2004. Of course, my favorite match is Batista vs HHH Wrestlemania 2005, especially since I can see me holding my sign during the build up to the match.

Overall, I found the product very entertaining, and the production is very slick.",1257033600,3,1690,4.552631578947368
3923599,3,B002FOFXB0,"I Was Actually Against Purchasing This DVD, So I Had Rented This One. Like The Internet Wrestling Community, I Was Also Against Batista Coming Out With A DVD This Early In His Career, Despite Other Performers Such As Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, Even From The Likes Of Mid-Carders Like Shelton Benjamin As Well. I Haven't Read The Book, But I Think That Since That Was Released, Maybe Some Readers Thought That He Should Put Out A DVD For The Non-Literary Community.

I Personally Love WWE DVD's That Really Get Into The Subject's Life And Upbringing And Also What Bought Them Into The Business, Let Alone Deep Backstage Issues And Rumors That The IWC Always Reads Everyday.

For Those People Who Like Non-Kayfabe WWE Documentaries, This One Is One To At Least Rent (For All Those Who Do Have Netflix Accounts.) This One To Me Is Intriging, But Not Much As The Shawn Michaels DVD Back In 2007, Or The Ric Flair DVDs.

P.S.- Also, I Was Pretty Much Glad This Wasn't Those Complilation DVDs Of Just Superstars And Their Matches, Like The Macho Man Collection.",1256083200,2,1056,4.697297297297298

3923613,2,B002FOFXB0,"This set confuses me. Why is Batista getting a three disc DVD? The documentary has a slim chance of being interesting, but even with that being the case, a his matches are NOT THAT GREAT. All of the matches except for 3 are on previous DVD's. The time wasted on this DVD set could have been given to someone else. This set is not a good idea.",1253404800,5,342,4.119402985074627
3923614,1,B002FOFXB0,"How in the world does this guy even get a dvd let alone a 3 disc set?  Once again, the WWE is promoting wrestlers who don't have the longevity or the wrestling ""resume"" to get a multiple dvd collection (Hint: John Cena).  I have nothing against Batista, but let's face it, you have other wrestlers in Vince's long extensive wrestling library that deserves to have their own 3 disc set. I feel to have a wrestler receive a multiple disc collection, he or she must have put in a great body of work in the business and Batista definitely hasn't done that in my opinion.  One wrestler that should have one is Chris Jericho.  Not only does Jericho have a long list of great matches to his credit that range from his time in Japan, ECW, WCW, and WWE, but he has more than enough matches that would probably extend beyond 3 discs.  I've read Batista's list of matches (what a joke).  Not to mention other wrestlers like Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, who is a legend in this sport and hasn't even been considered for his own dvd collection.  His matches alone from Memphis will be the making of a great collection.  Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase, ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude, Terry Funk, and countless other wrestlers who as far as I am concerned deserves their stories be told before Batista.  I am really disappointed with Vince McMahon and the WWE for the poor choices they have made lately and this one is without a doubt one of the worst. I can't see myself wasting my money on this dvd set. I've been a wrestling  fan for a very long time and I feel that the wrestlers I've just mentioned and countless other wrestlers should have been produced for fans to see on dvd.  Sorry, but in my opinion Batista doesn't deserve it.  Please WWE, you have to do better than this one.",1252368000,5,1796,4.458715596330276
3923615,4,B002FOFXB0,"I've noticed that everybody has been talking negative about Batista & his status with the WWE as of late. Some say he can't wrestle, doesn't have great microphone skills and shouldn't be a main event superstar like others before him. For those who dislike the man, maybe you need to go to YouTube and see a side of The Animal you've never seen before with him learning MMA(Mixed Martial Arts) by a guy named Marrese Crump. Personally, I hate to see him retire because if Shawn Michaels & The Undertaker can hold out this long in their illustrious careers, so can he, but yes he started too late. Triple H & The Undertaker are the only 2 superstars to put Batista over in the last 4 years. If he does plan on retiring, he should end his career at WrestleMania 26 by losing the WWE or World Heavyweight Championship to John Cena just like the Rock did with Stone Cold Steve Austin at their WrestleMania 23 Non-Title Match. It would've been great to see Dave win the title as many times as Ric Flair & Triple H, but that will never happen. I look forward to seeing this DVD and re-visit the Animal's best moments & matches in the WWE. For you Batista fans, let's hope the Animal's got some more fight left in him to still compete in the WWE.",1252368000,,1238,4.363636363636363

But This Is Getting Ridiculous All These Matches Any WWE DVD Collector Already Has.  And Batista Had Some Of His Best Matches On Smackdown And Raw And Even ECW.  Maybe It's Time To Make WWE Dvds With 2 Alternate Sets One With TV Show Matches And One With PPV Matches For Those Who Don't Own The PPV DVDs Already.  It's Just Another DVD Set That Could Have Been 10 Times Better But Now Will Have To Settle For Half Decent.,1252108800,3,541,4.123809523809523
3923617,3,B002FOFXB0,"I know that Batista, to the eyes of some, is an accomplished wrestler/entertainer, but for the vast majority of WWF/WWE fans that purchase these DVD set, it is to relive the accomplishments of wrestlers who have had a stellar career.  I believe that the biography portion of this DVD set will be great because it is based pretty much how his biography, which was released a couple of years ago, was set up.  I thought that the biography was honest, real, and emotional for him to discuss those aspects of his life with the general public.  As far as the matches on this set, I agree with the other people who stated that they are decent and for a die hard Batista fan, this set is a must buy.
What about all of the other wrestlers from the past who deserve a three DVD set of their top matches and feuds with a documentary that haven't had the honor of getting one made.  I have listed a few with the hopes that someone at Titan Towers rips off these ideas for the future: Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase, Ravishing Rick Rude, Andre the Giant, Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff, Owen Hart, Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, Trish Stratus, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, and Chris Jericho.  I would love to see the WWE release sets for Kurt Angle and Sting but that's a dream until they leave TNA.
These are just hopes and dreams for me.  Until those dreams come true, I will just wait with fingers crossed!",1248998400,,1390,4.431372549019608
3923618,2,B002FOFXB0,"First off, I hate to jump on the bandwagon along with other reviews, but I do hate the fact that the WWE is wasting time on a Batista DVD when there are so many other classic superstars that have completed their careers that deserve an entire DVD set with matches.

Second off, while I cannot comment on the biography part of the DVD because I have not seen it yet, I do anticipate it to be good.  WWE always comes through in a good way in these DVD bios.  They are always very informative, keep your attention, and are generally enjoyable.

Third off, (this is where my main complaint comes from) too many of these matches are available on other DVD's.  Also, many of them are matches that just aren't that great.  Part of the reason that I personally buy WWE DVD's is because of the rare gems of matches that are available on them.  That just is not the case here.  Below I will put a brief review of the matches (I have seen) and also list other DVD's they are available on.

(Parentheses shows what other DVD's a match is available on)

OVW Wrestling
Leviathan vs Doug Basham - OVW Wrestling 2001
Have not seen this one

Batista vs Kane - Armageddon 2002
A not bad big man power contest.  Batista shows some impressive strength.  5/10
(Armageddon 2002)

Batista vs Shawn Michaels - Armageddon 2003
Have not seen this one
(Armageddon 2003)

Tag Team Tables Match
Batista & Ric Flair vs Dudley Boyz - Royal Rumble 2004
Average lackluster tables match.  Nothing significant.  5/10
(Royal Rumble 2004, Royal Rumble Anthology set)

Batista vs Chris Jericho - Vengeance 2004
I hate to keep saying the same thing, but it's simply average.  Batista has a big tendency to only bring his A game to high profile matches.  Even Jericho couldn't squeeze anything above average out of him at this stage of Batista's career.  5.5/10
(Vengeance 2004)

30 Man Royal Rumble
Batista enters #28 - Royal Rumble 2005
This was Batista's 2nd or 3rd time to really bring his A game.  He puts on a good performance here.  You can definitely tell the increased effort.  This was a good Royal Rumble top to bottom, though I'm sure the action will pick up from Batista's entrance at #28.  8/10
(Royal Rumble 2005, Royal Rumble Anthology set)

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs Triple H - Wrestlemania 21
Good match.  Batista came ready for a high profile match and HHH was in the mood to make him look good.  Not a Wrestlemania classic that I will remember for years to come, but a good match.  7.5/10
(Wrestlemania 21)

Hell in a Cell
Batista vs Triple H - Vengeance 2005
This was Batista's best effort to date.  Very grueling match.  HHH seems to always do great in the cell and Batista really shined here.  Excellent effort put into this match.  Lots of blood, lots of hard hitting spots.  9/10
(Vengeance 2005, Triple H King of Kings, Hell in a Cell)

No Holds Barred
Batista vs JBL - Summerslam 2005
Short - which it needed to be, but almost too short to be given too high of a rating.  Mostly a brawl with a good powerbomb spot at the end.  5.5/10
(Summerslam 2005)

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs Eddie Guerrero - No Mercy 2005
Similiar to the Jericho match in that not even Guerrero could squeeze an above average match out of Batista, since this wasn't a very high profile match.  This match itself if just simply okay.  It lacked a big-match feel to it, which hurt it being the main event of a pay-per-view.  6/10
(No Mercy 2005, Legacy of Eddie Guerrero)

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs King Booker - Survivor Series 2006
I know these sound similiar, but the same explanations can be used with nearly every match.  While this was a more high profile match, Batista needs a really talented opponent to help him through these big matches.  King Booker at this stage of his career just couldn't fill that void.  Batista tries here, Booker tries here, but it just doesn't all come together that great.  6.5/10
(Survivor Series 2006)

Triple Threat for World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs King Booker vs Finlay - Smackdown 2006
Been too long since I've seen it to remember it - which probably means nothing stuck out about it too much.

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs the Undertaker - Wrestlemania 23
This is probably Batista's best match not only to date, but ever.  Batista shows up in a big way here, Undertaker delivers as always.  This match probably should have been the closer on the card, rather than Shawn Michaels vs John Cena.  I also want to note that there is one of the best announce table spots in recent history in this match.
This one delivers big time. 9.5/10
(Wrestlemania 23)

Steel Cage Match
Batista vs Edge - One Night Stand 2007
This match is just your average - once every 3 months - cage match that you can expect on Raw.  On top of that, Batista and Edge never had just great chemistry in any of their many matches.  5.5/10
(One Night Stand 2007)

Special Referee: Stone Cold
Batista vs the Undertaker - Cyber Sunday 2007
Good match here, but definitely not up to par with their great Wrestlemania 23 match.  When I first watched it, I was in fact pretty disappointed with it, considering what we were expecting.  After I rewatched it a couple of times, I appreciated it a little more.  While it is a good match, the chemistry and magic of their first match just isn't there.  7/10
(Cyber Sunday 2007)

6-Man Tag
Batista, Triple H, Ric Flair vs Randy Orton, Edge, Umaga - Raw 2007
Too long ago to recall it, I would suffice to say though that it is probably similiar to every other 6 man tag that we see on Raw once a month.

Batista vs John Cena - Summerslam 2008
Reviews of this match were mixed, I myself actually loved it.  The hype behind this match was huge, it had a great big match feel to it, and while watching it live I truly had no clue as to who would win.  It actually made me pretty mad how the live crowd jeered both men.  They did not even give the match a chance to get going before they attacked it.  The match actually delivered really well.  It was extremely fast paced and hard hitting.  I actually found myself wanting it to go longer at the end.  Well done here on both ends.  This might seem high, but 9/10.
(Summerslam 2008)

Batista vs Randy Orton - Armageddon 2008
See every other review about Batista only showing up in big matches and needing a worthy opponent with him. 4/10

Not only do I hate these DVD's that come out for active wrestlers (which means if Batista was to have another classic storyline or match in the future, what are they gonna make ANOTHER Batista DVD?? God help us all...) but I hate when a guy like him gets thus much publicity.  I have been a fan since 1980, and I can honsetly say there is not 1 Batista match I would wanna watch again. He is a giant waste, he is a horrid wrestler, he looks like he is seconds away from totally injuring either himself or his opponent, all his moves look so calculated (meaning FAKE). Its a travesty this is released before superstars like Rick Rude, Ricky Steamboat, hell, even Chris Jericho (but I hate all DVD's of active wrestlers...it will never feel complete) get their DVD's.

He is one of the many reasons I have stopped watching wrestling (Cena is another one...)...
