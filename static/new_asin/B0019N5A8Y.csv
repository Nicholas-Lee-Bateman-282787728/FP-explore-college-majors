3442033,5,B0019N5A8Y,"I saw this film originally on T.V. May 13 on Nova. The stories of the affected women made me cry. What a horrible existence they had been left to, until they were able to get to the special hospital. I also cried for them tears of joy when they were ""cured"" of their injuries. This was a heartwrenching film, one every woman/mother should see. We are so lucky to live where we do and have access to such great health care. I would like to purchase this DVD when it is released because I would like many of my friends and family to see it and help with donations to this cause.",1211241600,7,576,4.151785714285714

3442056,5,B0019N5A8Y,Is a Wonderful documentary. So wonderfully heartwarming...Women are so loving and caring for each other. Sisters in life. ALL over the world. One of my favorite documentaries.,1418860800,,175,5.518518518518518
3442057,5,B0019N5A8Y,"Others have described what this incredible documentary is about. I wanted to add a few of my thoughts, and be among the many attesting to the importance of this profoundly moving video.

I distinctly remember when I first saw this documentary -- it was an experience that is impossible to forget. It was on PBS, several years ago, and I sat in stunned silence, with a tearstreaked face, and practically no physical movement, given the intensity of how thunderstruck (and heartbreakingly horrified) I was by what was being revealed to me for the first time.

I had never heard of nor known of obstetric fistulas, let alone the nature or scope of this incomparable nightmare suffered by an appalling number of women -- and girls -- in Africa.

This documentary is one of the most important, and most powerful, of any I will ever see in my life.

For some viewers, who are young enough to take a specific route in their life to go into medicine, I would not be surprised if this documentary were to result in choices by some viewers to specialize in repairing this life-shattering reality that is suffered (physically, emotionally, psychologically, socially -- completely life-alteringly) by the too-many-to-wrap-one's-mind-around number of females (and so many of whom are young) whose lives are otherwise horrendously given a horrifying form of 'life sentence' (and for so many, a form of 'death sentence' (not only in the sense that they are rendered outcasts by their society, abandoned by spouses, shunned by even family members, and are forced to try and survive by themselves, and without a social fabric in their lives -- but literal death will be the end result for many (given the many complications that can occur in the wake of an obstetric fistula), and sometimes the death of these girls and women will be via suicide, given the extraordinary devastation and depression associated with the altogether life-shattering reality of obstetric fistulas.))

The multitude of girls who are forced into marriage as children (which is disturbingly prevalent in many countries in Africa, and involves associated obstetric fistula rates of almost 90% in some of those countries), and who are subsequently forced to become pregnant before their bodies are capable of delivering a child, will have an extremely limited chance of living anything even remotely considered to be a normal life, let alone ever bearing children, unless their obstetric fistula is repaired. Not only physically, and psychosocially, let alone in various cases *literally*, the surgery becomes their only chance at having a life.

For those girls and women who learn of, and can somehow make their way to one of the few medical resources available to them, and specifically, to one of the relatively rare clinics or hospitals with a doctor who can surgically repair the physical damage associated with obstetric fistulas (and address whatever else among the multitude of complicating cascading negative consequences may have already occurred by such time), the 'life sentence' ends up being 'commuted', and these fortunate females who were able to receive the surgery (and any additional requisite treatment for associated damage that has occurred to and within their bodies, as a result of the fistula) are given a chance at a new life.

A very informative article from a Fall 2008 edition of the publication ""Reviews In Obstetrics & Gynecology"" would serve as a good introduction to this subject -- the article can be found by entering the relevant Library of Medicine PMCID# of PMC2621054 in a certain very popular search engine.

Included in that article is mention of the reality that < obstetric fistula is considered the ""near miss"" of maternal mortality > -- though given the extreme and devastating nature of what is associated with obstetric fistula, some would argue that living with obstetric fistula is 'a fate worse than death'.

In conjunction with this documentary, the viewer learns of the remarkable Dr. Hamlin, and her dedicated and caring staff at the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital (which was co-founded by Dr. Hamlin and her husband, back in 1974, and remains the only medical center in the world dedicated exclusively to fistula repair). All patients of the hospital are treated completely free of charge.

This documentary, ""A Walk to Beautiful"", won the Best Feature-Length Documentary of 2007 award from the International Documentary Association, and won an Emmy for Best Long Form documentary in 2008.

Dr. Hamlin and her husband co-founded The Fistula Foundation, which currently works with partners in 28 countries to not only educate and try to prevent obstetric fistula, but is highly focused on treatment, and includes training of local medical personnel.

The first gynecological surgery hospital in the U.S. was essentially a fistula hospital -- it opened in 1855. The need for the surgery in the U.S. and other industrialized countries was largely a past tense reality by the late 1800s. The occurrence of obstetric fistula in resource-poor countries, however, has all but remained what it was in the 1800s, and before.

Obstetric fistula is preventable.

My heart breaks for the girls and women whose lives involve the excruciating misery of being affected by -- let alone who, as a result of circumstance, must endure -- this horrible and otherwise preventable form of hell.

The day I saw this documentary was a day that changed my life, and it opened my eyes to a reality that is unforgettable, and is one to which my attention has repeatedly found itself drawn, in the desire to assist in some way, even if all I can do is support the foundations whose work focuses on the prevention and treatment of this awful, awful life-shattering, physically-decimating, emotionally-devastating medical reality, and its intensely destructive psycho-social consequence. And the fact that so many of those affected by it are children is yet another 'knife-twist to the heart'.

I am grateful that this documentary was made. It is important that the world learn of obstetric fistula and the millions of lives being shattered by it. If I happen to be alive on whatever day in the future the horrendous reality of obstetric fistula is deemed to have been 'eradicated' -- if it ever is -- it will be a day that is priceless in its joy, relief, and gratitude.",1418083200,,6350,5.068007662835249
3442058,5,B0019N5A8Y,This is an incredibly moving film. Makes me so appreciative of what we have here in regards to readily available healthcare. Thank you to the amazing physicians from Australia who went to Ethiopia to help women live fuller lives and help free them from the painful isolation they were living in with fistula. I can't recommend this movie enough.,1412380800,,345,4.864406779661017
3442059,4,B0019N5A8Y,I ordered this dvd on a whim and I'm glad I did I learn so much about the health problems women have in other countries. There is so much we take for granted here in this country.  It encourages you to want to get involve any way you can to help different organizations which provide aid.,1401753600,,288,4.142857142857143
3442060,5,B0019N5A8Y,"I first saw this documentary on PBS several years ago, and it was deeply moving and unforgettable.  I'm so glad I was able to find it on Amazon, so that I could order my own copy.

The terrible plight of these young women needing surgery who are so publically rejected due to no fault of their own really challenged my complacency and tendency to ""whine"" about trivial things.  When I saw this film, I was on the verge of being laid off from my counseling position at our local community college (due to budget cuts).  I decided that my getting laid off wouldn't be so bad after all, as I could retire instead and then assist these women just as I had young adults at our college.  Even though I didn't eventually get laid off, this film still continues to ""haunt"" me and challenge me to consider serving these young women in the future.

This is a film that needs to be seen, esp. by women.",1395705600,,891,4.337349397590361
3442061,5,B0019N5A8Y,I am so moved and touched with this show.  The women have endured such hardship and cruelity....and then humiliation on top of that.  To find a place they can go to be healed and not judged is fantastic.  I watch this everytime it's on tv.  I will buy it next.  I cry and cry for the women.  Its a must have dvd.,1389139200,,312,3.9516129032258065
3442062,5,B0019N5A8Y,"This one-hour NOVA documentary of five Ethiopian women who suffer from fistula will break your heart.  I was still weeping when I woke the morning after.  Two to three million women worldwide experience this traumatic aftermath  of birthing.  You probably don't know what fistula is.  I had heard of it but was unclear about the details.  Because girls in impoverished countries are engaged in intensive hard work from a very early age, their growth is stunted.  Add to this marriage at an early age (13 and younger), and what results is an inability to deliver a baby.  Labor may last as long as 10 days with usually a stillborn baby somehow wrenched from the girl.  This often leaves a hole between the vagina and bladder and in some cases the rectum.  The victims are incontinent, leaking urine and sometimes feces.  Adding insult to injury, they are abandoned and rejected by their husbands and families, banished to live alone in shacks, waiting to die.
 The good news:  there is a Fistula Foundation.  The film shows their hospital in Addis Ababa where women who can make their way there are treated surgically and given kindness and education about their situation.  The courage of the women to get there and the devotion and fine work of the doctors are heart-warming, but the film leaves you wanting some way to address the underlying and ongoing causes of this outrage.",1383523200,,1379,4.808510638297872
3442063,5,B0019N5A8Y,"I would recommend this for every woman to see.  During pregnancy most of us have good prenatal care and safe and healthy deliveries.  The true stories of these young women will make you wonder, why those of us who had great care ever thought it was that was for everyone.  This is one movie that every pregnant woman should watch.  Believe me, you will feel guilty about ever complaining again.  Beautiful true documentary.  It tells it like it is.  Nothing is sugar coated.",1363046400,,474,4.63855421686747
3442074,4,B0019N5A8Y,Short but excellent. I love these type of films that bring to light circumstances in the world that get little to no attention in the main stream media. Complications from childbirth are a significant issue for women in impoverished countries and in countries with limited medical care. Plus what makes the issue even more devastating is the fact that in many of these societies (like in Ethiopia) the women are third class citizens and are blamed and shunned when anything goes wrong in childbirth. The documentary is well directed and well edited. The profiles are touching. I watched with my 12 year old daughter. Children need to know these things. In fact watching with my daughter made the film even more poignant since kids were getting married off at ages younger than her!,1347667200,,781,4.879699248120301

3442077,5,B0019N5A8Y,"The other reviews do an excellent job of summing up this film, so I won't go into too much detail.  It is heartbreaking to watch these women (girls, really) have to go through the physical and psychological torment that is accompanied by their obstetric fistulas and the subsequent shunning by their families, friends, and communities that occurs.  Especially heartwrenching is seeing young Wubete, tears running down her face, as she describes how her father kept sending her off to be married--all before she is even a teenager--and how she would ""run away"" each time, then suffering the anguish of a stillbirth after a long, drawn out labor that ultimately leads to the fistula problem.  She describes how she cannot return to her village in the physical state that she is in, because nobody will accept her.  After several failed fistula surgeries, Wubete finally finds some peace, and with it you can sense that her life is just now beginning.

I watched A Walk To Beautiful 3 times in one day, and then I had my family sit down and watch it with me.  I highly recommend this film.  It will alter the way you see the world and your place within it.",1296950400,2,1153,4.678217821782178
3442078,5,B0019N5A8Y,"You are a poor girl in the Ethiopian countryside.  Your body is stunted and slight from too much physical labor done at too young an age.  At nine years old, your father marries you off to a man four times as old as you.

You are only 4 1/2 feet tall.

At age fourteen, you go into labor with your first child.  Hours turn into days, then into a week.  The baby is ramming against your tiny lower pelvis, trapping your flesh between its head and your bones.  Cut off from its blood supply, that tissue  begins to die.  Days later, an obstructed birth has killed your child, and you have entered the hell that is an untreated obstetric fistula--a birth injury that leaves you unable to control your bladder, bowels, or both.

Your husband rejects you.  Your parents don't want to see your face.  Welcome to the death-in-life that is your existence.  You've joined a sisterhood of hundereds of thousands in Ethiopia alone, and yet you think you are a sorority of one.

In a wealthy country, the operation that corrects a fistula is routine (a dear friend of mine had it done in an hour under a spinal block).  In Africa and the Muslim world, you are hopelessly cut off from a gentle hand and help.  Shame is your only friend.  This documentary tells the quiet, humble stories of several such afflicted women--really, little girls---who find help at a special hospital in Addis Ababa.

We just don't have a CLUE how hard life is for women in most of the world.  This small, quiet film gives us just a glimpse, but what a glimpse it is.  ""You don't have to be a woman to understand a woman's problems"" says the surgeon who does thirty operations a week.  And you don't have to be poor to imagine the implications for a society that shames girls after forcing them to work and marry far too young.  This documentary will make you furious at the blind stupidity of it all, and it will also lift your heart up clear to the sky, all in only an hour. But for an accident of birth, these women's stories could be ours.  For the sake of these sweet children of God, watch this documentary.",1276128000,10,2078,4.410526315789474
3442079,5,B0019N5A8Y,"A Walk to Beautiful exposes the hardships, persecutions and suffering faced by women in nations where there is no access to experienced birth attendants.  Fistulas occur when the birth is extremely difficult, the baby generally dies and the mother's birth canal goes through significant damage that results in leaking of  bladder and/or fecal matter through the vaginal canal.  People in the young women's communities literally throw these women to the wolves or allow them to live on the outer edges of the community in isolation.  When women do hear about the option of having a fistula repaired, they travel for days to get to these amazing hospitals in order to be cured.  Fistulas are also the result of girls who are barely women giving birth when their bodies are not mature.  Imagine having your life ""over"" by 14.  We can all support fistula hospitals such as HEAL Africa and give these women back their lives.  Please watch this powerful video.",1268870400,5,954,4.91875
3442080,5,B0019N5A8Y,"Great documentary setting out the terrible health issues especially fistual problems for rural women, and others in Africa. Another recommended resource is ""the hospital by the River"" story of the doctors who set up the hospital in Ethiopia and have continued to help these poor women restructure their lives.",1265500800,,309,5.326530612244898
3442081,5,B0019N5A8Y,"This is a wonderful inspiring story of a private hospital in Ethiopia dedicated to serving and healing mostly poor, rural and young women who have gotten an obstetric fistula during long unaided childbirths. A fistula is a small hole made between the birth canal and bladder, sometimes also between the rectum and birth canal because of the continuous rubbing of the unborn child's head over multiple days against her pelvic bones. It is almost unheard of here or in other developed countries because we have access to medical help if labor continues too long, but it is a life wrecking experience for about 3% of women in rural areas of undeveloped countries. Their bodies heal from the labor, but the little hole stays open and from then on they have a constant leak of urine. It is just as heartbreaking as the woman with the issue of blood. They become complete outcasts from their communities. It is very tragic.

The Women's Fistula Hospital, a bright, clean, welcoming place of healing for these women is the fruit of Reginald and Catherine Hamlin. Two Australian gynocoligists who came to do benevolent service in Ethiopia for a few years in the late 1950's and were taken in by the tragedy that this group of women faced. They learned about how to make repairs and have truly become pioneers in the field, helping multiplied thousands of women and their families every year. Dr. Reg Hamlin died in Ethiopia and if Dr. Catherine Hamlin is still living, I am sure she is still at the hospital.

The Hamlins were very precious people, very devoted and constant, who established this hospital that gives free care to those who are literally the least able to repay them. They stayed in Ethiopia through much political turmoil and unrest. God gave them the grace to stay out of politics and they were able to build this free clinic in the midst of a hostile government with private support from  groups in Australia, England and the United States.

I felt so inspired by this DVD to learn more about this place and the people they help that I bought Catherine Hamlin's book, THE HOSPITAL BY THE RIVER, wich I recommend to anyone who wants to read an incredible story about two people devoted to doing work to help people in the spirit of Christ. The Hamlins journey and work in Ethiopa was absolutely a reflection of their commitment to serving the Lord Jesus Christ in their lifes' work.

Gives me a feeling of great hope and thankfulness to know that good work like this is taking place in the world.",1259452800,,2506,4.6863636363636365
3442082,5,B0019N5A8Y,"This is a tough review for me to write. After watching this, I am so moved that I'm not sure what to write in this review. This film is an incredibly powerful, emotional experience and it educated me about a serious health issue I never knew existed. I can't begin to express just how badly I felt for women afflicted with obstetric fistula, a type of childbirth injury that, according to the people interviewed in this film, occurs most often in poor, rural areas of developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Arab world. I watched with anticipation and genuine anxiety the trials of five women in this documentary; they all had to endure obstetric fistula for years and they became outcasts in their communities because the members of their communities were disgusted by the smells and the symptoms of fistula. Women with fistula are unable their urges to go to the bathroom. To make matters worse for these women, they honestly didn't realize there were other women like them and they thought there was nowhere to go for treatment. They often heard of a hospital merely by luck when word-of-mouth reached them in their area hundreds of miles away from the only hospital helping women with fistula. This documentary, however, highlights the very real possibility of a woman's being cured of fistula using surgical methods to correct the problem; and to see the joyful expressions on their faces and the lovely clothes they were given when they were leaving the hospital to start their new lives after they were cured was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

This documentary focuses on five Ethiopian women who have traveled from remote, rural areas to the capital city of Addis Ababa where they find relief, kindness and surgeons ready to assist them and correct the problem that has caused their lives to be a living hell for years. These women, like others in certain parts of the world, have spent the last several years of their lives being treated as lepers in their own communities because people were repulsed by the way these women smelled; they could not control their urges to go to the bathroom.

I don't want to spoil it all for you; but I will tell you one story out of the five the documentary focuses on. One young woman, Wubete, has to travel three times to the hospital from her rural village because her bladder was so severely damaged during childbirth that she is left with an unusually small bladder. In Wubete's case, physical exercises to achieve bladder control were not working well. She is so happy when she is finally able to control her bathroom urges that she wishes to stay at the hospital perhaps as an employee; the hospital doesn't hire her but they do find her a job working at an orphanage and Wubete looks happier than ever. It practically made me cry tears of joy. The other four stories are equally poignant and quite memorable; and the staff was the kindest you could ever imagine.

The DVD comes with an extra about the extent of obstetric fistula; it is brief but very well done and informative. There are a few other extras but this is the most valuable one.

Overall, A Walk to Beautiful is an important documentary that practically everyone should see once they are able to handle the mature subject matter involved here. Before I saw this movie I had never even heard of fistula. I learned an awful lot from watching this film; and I highly recommend this DVD.",1252627200,7,3423,4.690515806988353
3442083,5,B0019N5A8Y,"It was with great pleasure that I watched ""Walk to Beautiful"", but not without tears of joy and sympathy.  The film captured the wonderful staff caring for the constant stream of patients with fistula injury, many of whom have been suffering for years mentally, emotionally, socially and physically.
The 5 case studies presented in the film all showed such dignity and perserverance, it was easy to travel with them on their journey and hope for their recovery.
As an Australian I was very proud that the work started 50 years ago by Drs Reg and Catherine Hamlin from Sydney is still very much going strong and growing! More satellite hospitals now exist in more remote parts of the country and doctors from all over Africa are being trained in the surgical techniques needed.  The co-founder Catherine Hamlin's vision to PREVENT the injury from occuring by training midwives to work in villages is a wonderful way to celebrate 50 years of compassionate service.",1240963200,2,962,4.932098765432099
