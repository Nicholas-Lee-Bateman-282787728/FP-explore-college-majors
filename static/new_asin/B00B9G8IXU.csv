8738972,5,B00B9G8IXU,"I'm a big fan of local history.  I absolutely love the history of the Catskills & Hudson Valley, NY.  This documentary breathes new life into the history of the early days of Catskill settlements, retreats, & vacationing.  The structures that once stood amidst the mountains are nothing short of spectacular as are the people who constructed and traveled to them. I highly recommend this DVD if you are interested in the early days & histories of Catskill Mountain range.",1529539200,,471,4.936708860759493
