8449901,2,B004ZJ9VR0,"No Plot Spoilers.

This follow-up to The Heir Apparent lost its drive.  On the cover of the DVD it shows Sharon Stone with a gun, leading you to believe that she is involved in action scenes and has a shoot-out.  She never has a gun in the film, therefore no shoot-out.

The plot is not interesting, and you end up saying ""Why do I care what happens to Largo?""

When you stop caring about the protagonist, you stop caring about the film.",1373155200,5,437,4.280487804878049
