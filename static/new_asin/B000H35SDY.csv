8136115,5,B000H35SDY,"If you are a Clint Holmes fan or not, you will appreciate a really talented vocalist in a great 90+ minute traditional Las Vegas music show (from 2001). He is dynamite, and the band/vocalists with him are top-notch. It is such a shame that this type of show is on it's way out, and being replaced by the monster extravaganzas.

While I'm sure he has made a very good living over the past 30+ years in his Las Vegas/Atlantic City type shows, it is a shame that Clint never quite hit it REALLY big in the music industry.

It's sad to see today's current 20-something zero-talent, alchoholic, drunk-driving DORKS and MORONS earn millions overnight, while TALENTED people have had to work in clubs 6 nights a week for years to showcase their legitimate talent.

This DVD is very well produced and has top-notch sound too.",1192233600,2,817,4.620689655172414
