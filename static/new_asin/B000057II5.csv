1401759,4,B000057II5,"This isn't a bad movie, but what I had rather see is a compilation of the seasons that ""Wackiest Ship in the Army"" was on TV. The TV show was, all told, much superior to this movie.  The missions they were sent on and the dangers that they faced were exciting, and at the same time done with much humor.  I'm not knocking this movie at all, but I would prefer to see the several seasons of the TV show on DVD.  McHale's Navy it definitely wasn't.",1167696000,,446,4.103448275862069
1401760,5,B000057II5,"If you enjoy the comic antics of Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men, Grumpier Old Men), give yourself a treat.  Mr. Lemmon's earlier films are well written, campy, and just plain fun! Two of my favorite Lemmon films are HOW TO MURDER YOUR WIFE and THE WACKIEST SHIP IN THE ARMY.  Give yourself a fun filled evening.  Send the kids out for pizza, turn off the phone, pop some popcorn, and curl up on the sofa with THE WACKIEST SHIP IN THE ARMY. Don't expect a deep ""meaningful"" plot or some kind of political metaphor.  Isn't it time for a good laugh, the way we use to?",1152403200,4,562,4.273584905660377
1401761,4,B000057II5,So many movies from this time frame are just out of step with modern expectations of entertainment. This one is not. It could be re-released and still find a good audience. If you're looking for a good clean movie that tickles the funny bone of parents AND children this is a good choice.,981072000,31,288,4.452830188679245
1401762,4,B000057II5,"I rented this the other day with the full intention of sitting through a rather cheesy comedy from the early 1960s.  That is to say, I wasn't expecting much.  Jack Lemmon is always a worthwhile watch, and he plays his  captain well.  And Rick Nelson does a surprisingly effective job of acting,  with subtle glances and gestures.  Ever the quiet and polite junior  officer, you root for the kid with the heart of gold.  It is a humorous and  entertaining film, with just the right amount of slapstick without becoming  too silly, despite the film's title.  And there's a bonus...Rick sings in  his usual dreamy style.  It's good fun for the whole family.  Even today.",954806400,46,667,4.6869565217391305

1401805,5,B000057II5,I watched this movie last night and it's a very entertaining nostalgia trip. I guess growing up in the 1970's these were the type of movies you would see on a Saturday afternoon back then with that technicolor look to them. Sure it has plot holes and bad special effects but there are also moments of real drama and interesting observations about the war in the pacific. Probably not viewed by the critics as a great movie but once I started watching I was hooked to see how it unfolded which is all that matters. Some well done other characters as well...The Australian coast spotter was great.,1496793600,,595,4.570093457943925
1401806,5,B000057II5,"Few movies get 5 stars from me - this one might have been a four but gains at least one for being old enough NOT to have ANY CGI in it.

1401807,5,B000057II5,Excellent movie. Jack Lemmon was actually a WW2 Navel Officer and also a yatchman.  Sad that we lost Ricky Nelson at such an early age but I thought he was great in this movie.,1493769600,,176,4.176470588235294

His was more tha wooden...perhaps ""stone"" would describe his performance better.  A good story is a good story, and this film has one.  The title implies that the story revolves around a ""ship"" so I was disappointed that this was more of a mere ""boat""...but the twists and turns in the story make this well worth watching, and Lemmon is great here.",1480636800,,506,4.588888888888889

The crew is an assortment of sailors with no sail experience, but he gets them into shape enough to keep the ship from sinking and to eventually complete its mission.

Ricky Nelson plays his first officer, and does so pretty well. Richard Anderson plays another naval officer who is supposed to take command of the ship for the second half of the mission.

Some slap stick, some sailing action, even some gun play when they are captured by Japanese troops but manage to get away.

Having seen the picture many times since it was issued, I expected it to be a bit stale for me. Not in the least. Certainly I have grown more than a bit stale over the intervening years, but the movie remains a delight, if not quite as much as it was when first it saw the light of day.  Jack Lemmon, of course,  does his thing with perfection and carries the film. Rick Nelson is quite suitable as the young Ensign serving under him, while Mike Kellin does his usual first rate supporting job as the Old Salt. (Interestingly, during WW2, Kellin served as a Naval Lieutenant Commander). Like Lemmon and Nelson, he, too is gone from the scene.

1402173,2,B000057II5,"Um, what was the idea behind the movie's title?  I never actually got the idea.  I didn't find much in the way of wacky comedy-or much in the way of comedy, period.

A lieutenant is given command of a small and decrepit sailing vessel, the Echo, which has a mission of sailing into Japanese waters during World War Two.  Said lieutenant had been involved in racing sailing vessels in civilian life, so he had been pressured into taking command of the Echo by his superiors, since none of the Navy people assigned to the ship really knew how to operate a sailing schooner.  After quite a bit of screen time, the lieutenant is finally cajoled into taking command and training the sailors to operate this ship.  (Why would the Navy even need to use a sailing schooner for a mission?  To sail into a port no large ship or submarine could reach.)

There are some funny bits, such as a sailor riding on crane hooks to cross a large ship, or the Echo having to maneuver to avoid being crushed between two large ships.  Overall, however, the movie was dull and confusing and we didn't bother to watch until the end.",1408147200,2,1107,4.467661691542289

For moving logistics they were usually manned by contract civilians.  This movie features a covert mission to insert an Australian coast watcher on Cape Gloucester on New Britian island.  Also featured is a nice song by Ricky Nelson.  As a comedy this movie falls flat because of the seriousness of the mission.  Though this mission uses a vulnerable sailing schooner, the crew has one edge.  It has an M-2 fifty caliber machine gun which wins the day.

1402350,1,B000057II5,"Before the film even began, there were expectations.  Merely the title alone demonstrated that the viewer could expect three major elements, humor, military hijinks, and a group of outsiders overcoming a major adversity to become a shimmer in the community's eye.  Before the DVD even makes it into the player, these are the already famous clichs that Hollywood is notorious for.  Boasted as a comedy, coupled with the animated out of film credit sequence, I knew that we were already one step into the game (i.e. the comedy), but the joke literally stopped there.  With the zany credits, one could have guessed this film down to the final keystroke, but it never formulated that way.  ""The Wackiest Ship in the Army"" was prepared and ready, not to overuse sailing terms, it just never left the port.  This film provided no laughter, horrible special effects, a lackluster second crew, and a premise that still confuses this critic - were there ""Ships"" in the ""Army"".  This Jack Lemmon vehicle seemed too eager to attach itself to others of the same genre, perhaps capture income from those viewers assuming the best, but the foundation was never set - we had nothing to grow upon, so we cared nothing about our team.  From the horrid direction, the abysmal characters, and possibly the flimsiest story ""in the Army"", this film was an embarrassment to everyone involved - most particularly - the Army.

Navy.  Let's just get it out of the troubled air first - shouldn't this film be called ""The Wackiest Ship in the Navy"".  To begin with it has a stronger presence, reminding you of the good times we had with ""McHale's Navy"", but here it feels as if the director is already telling us a joke we don't feel like laughing at.  Perhaps the two words, ""Ship"" and ""Army"" are a joke within themselves, demonstrating the power of the comedy right off the bat.  Well, it failed.  This was an annoying title that just got worse as I continued to think about the logistics.  With this thought out of the way, what else failed in this film?  Two words: Jack Lemmon.  This was the worst film to showcase his talents, because he demonstrated no ability at all.  His character, the most capable non-captain apparently in the entire Army (...or is it Navy?), was unfunny, overzealous, and arrogant throughout the picture.  Coupled with his mopey second in command (a horrid Ricky Nelson as Ens. Hanson) that seemed to only take directions subtlety without passion or excitement, created a cinematic experience that was both boring and uncreative all at the same time.  While I didn't want these two central characters to fall within the Hollywood clich circle, I did want some comfort - some actual humor - as well as some chemistry that built upon that humor.  Alas, none was present, and instead we had two actors just play their part all the while collecting their paycheck.

When a film uses the word ""Wackiest"" in its title, it would imply that there is going to be mischief, uncalled for chaos (also involving mischief), and characters that are larger than life providing us with the belly laughs we need through these harsh economic times.  In my opinion, ""Wackiest"" is a misrepresentation for this film.  The idea behind this film, a Navy man has to sail his way into enemy territory using a crew that knows nothing about actual sailing and ultimately asked to save the day.  I know...I know, the jokes should have been flowing like the green screen ocean behind Lemmon, but it never did.  The premise is strong, it had the potential to make you laugh - it drew ideas from other comedy films that do make you laugh - but where this film failed was in its execution.  Comedy was forbidden in this film.  Sure, there were scenes that attempted at comedy (i.e. the bad coffee sight gag), and there was plenty of pre-music warning us that something funny could happen - but nothing did.  We spend forty minutes getting to the boat, twenty minutes on it, then the other forty carelessly outsmarting the Japanese insurgency.  There were no sight gags, no quotable lines, and definitely nothing to say this would be great with friends and family.  ""The Wackiest Ship in the Army"" floundered, with poor production values and paper-thin characters, not even a grin was worth the effort.  If this ship was aptly called ""The Wackiest"", then I feel bad for those other vessels that probably promised laughs - and followed through successfully.

There is very little positive praise that one can give this film.  Jack Lemmon, a man that I admire from his work on ""The Apartment"" and ""The Odd Couple"" knows, or should I say knew, comedy.  He knew how to make this viewer laugh, and he has done it with what seemed like the greatest grace, but this film didn't even scratch the surface of his potential.  Why waste such a talented actor on a script that had larger holes than those written by Louis Sachar.  It felt as if the writers had to produce a script in three days, or they would lose their jobs.  This film, ""The Wackiest Ship in the Army"" is that final project.  None of the characters, even Lemmon, are worth viewing.  The pathetic attempt at danger, attempting to build any suspense especially during the mine field gimmick, was devastatingly bad.  This was not comedy.  This was not even an attempt at comedy.  This was faux comedy.  Not quite real - even when the entire audience is hoping for the best.

Overall, I have to admit, this was a horrid film.  One could argue that Jack Lemmon could never make a disastrous film, and I would have to continually quote this film.  Absolutely nothing worked in this film, from the comedy, the factual elements, and even the moments of suspense - it just seemed pre-cut.  This was a pre-determined film, knowing from the beginning that the ending was in sight and no clouds ahead.  I can't argue about that, in this pre-determined world Hollywood, there is a sense of comfort with knowing how a film will end, but it is how we get to that ending that counts.  In this film, that was nearly as bad as our outside elements.  The characters were never witty, never dialogue savvy, or even schooled in physical comedy.  Nothing worked in this ""naval"" comedy.  I would love to tell you something, anything positive about this film, just in hopes that perhaps I missed something - but alas, I cannot suggest it to anyone.  I would like to attach this warning - this is not a comedy - repeat - this is not a comedy.  View at your own risk ... we cannot promise your safety.

1402351,4,B000057II5,"This is not a major war movie,but,it is very enjoyable none-the-less. Jack Lemmon plays a much more competent Naval officer than his Oscar winning role as Ensign Pulver in ""Mister Roberts"".This time he is given an assignment to take a broken down sailing vessel through Japanese held waters for a special mission to deliver an Australian Coast Watcher to his post on an island in enemy waters. The trip is at times comical and at times exciting. Rick Nelson gives his best acting performance since ""Rio Bravo"" and is more than competent as the second officer. All in all it is a fun and entertaining movie. Recommended for anyone who likes their WW II movies with some comedy as well as action.",1222646400,6,694,4.69672131147541

1402354,5,B000057II5,"If you judged this movie by its title, you might conclude that this was another idiotic, moronic attempt at finding humor in WWII. Not true! this is an entertaining, drama/comedy (there are some humorous scences, but the movie is not slapstick and not like the humor in sit coms). I am not sure if this is based on a true story, but it could have been. The premise is believable. The details of the plot can be found in other reviews.

Yes--the film includes Ricky Nelson, who, while not known as a great actor, does deliver a decent performance.  Yes--he does manage to sing one song (his voice is actually fairly good) in the officer's club at the start of the film. The film is mostly Jack Lemmon who does his usual great job. If you don't like Jack Lemmon, you will not like this film.

The real surprise was how good this 1960 film looks on DVD. The transfer is fantastic!  Presented in anamorphic widescreen, the picture is sharp and crisp and the colors are perfect!  The picture and sound were great on my 46-inch LCD high definition TV, played on a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player. It is hard to believe that this film was not remastered (there are no claims that it was)--it sure looks that way. The sound is also quite good.
