8559966,1,B00B034QTM,"This is another one of those knockoff PD sets.  Pass on this and buy CBS/Paramount's wonderful ""The Lucy Show - The Complete Fifth Season"" instead.  The CBS release contains most every episode on this knockoff set, and then some.  (The remaining are found on CBS's equally wonderful Season 6 release).  The CBS release is not only authorized, but is sourced from gorgeous new 35mm transfers.  Additionaly, the CBS release includes terrific bonus features, most notably the hour-long special ""Lucy in London"" which originally aired during season 5 and hasn't been aired since.
The CBS release costs less, is authorized, and looks amazing.  No-brainer here.  Don't be duped!!",1379030400,,673,5.233644859813084
