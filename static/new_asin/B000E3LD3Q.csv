2486511,5,B000E3LD3Q,"I'm recently new to Christi Taylor workouts and wish I had found them sooner!  She is just plain fun, and since I workout everyday, I really need exciting music and an exciting instructor to get me motivated. All of her stuff is amazing.  The moves can be a bit complicated, but if you just stick with it - you can get it.  And before you pay 17.99 - check out Christi's website where it is sold for 9.99!",1200355200,,405,4.166666666666667
2486512,1,B000E3LD3Q,"I own several at home workout dvd's and I would have to say this is the worst one.  The production value is bad and the cueing is awful.  The instuctor is absolutely dripping wet by the end of the workout, which is absolutely disgusting to look at.  Its broken up into segments, so why the cast does not change in between segments, I do not know.  I would consider myself an intermediate/advanced stepper, and I found the demonstration part of each step routine way too hurried.  Everything is just so hurried that its very easy to become frustrated if you don't get something right away.",1194480000,2,588,4.561904761904762
2486513,5,B000E3LD3Q,Another super DVD (actually 2 DVD's!) by Christi Taylor.  Motivating  music and a great variety of steps and moves.  This is a real bargain for this award winning DVD!!  BUY IT!!,1187395200,,178,4.645161290322581
2486514,4,B000E3LD3Q,"Christi Taylor has great queing, which is good because the steps are fairly complicated. There are four different workouts on this DVD and all of them are a great workout and fun. The choreography will keep even the advanced exerciser on their toes.",1176076800,,249,4.813953488372093
2486515,5,B000E3LD3Q,I am an experienced exerciser.  I have been doing step and high-low aerobics for years.  This was one of the best that I have ever done. I truly felt that I got a good workout.,1174348800,,176,4.0
2486516,5,B000E3LD3Q,"I truly wish I had found this DVD earlier...say 20 step DVD's earlier.  This DVD has something for every home exerciser.  You can do the step or dance for 25, 50 or 90 minutes.  There are also options (with real people doing them, not just someone saying what the moves are) for beginners and intermediates.  Any advanced exerciser will find this DVD challenging by completing the 90 minute portion with ""all"" the moves.

I think that Christy really thought this through and tried to consider what the home exerciser really needs.

I will use this for a long, long, time",1166400000,13,570,4.65
2486517,5,B000E3LD3Q,"This is the best bang for the buck out there in workout videos.  I understand it recently won a review award as well.  Christi uses motivating, great music and cues so well that picking up on her somewhat complex choreography is really not hard at all.  I have been doing step aerobics for years, and thought that I hated too much choreography but Christi makes it so much fun you'll love it.  I'd say the intensity is intermediate, but only if you're already in great shape.  All four DVDs are great workouts, and this is probably the single best buy out there for home-fitness DVDs.  Christi is hands-down my favorite instructor.",1162598400,15,631,4.63963963963964
8105259,4,B000E3LD3Q,Does have some tricky choreography but once you get it down it's fun.  I get bored when I know the routine too well.,1478044800,,116,4.043478260869565
8105260,5,B000E3LD3Q,"I just love christi Taylor's choreography.  It's mostly complex, but fun.  She has such a fun personality and it truly helps when you feel like you're frustrated and ready to quit.  When you finally learn the choreography, it's always so fun and so worth it.",1432425600,,258,4.688888888888889
8105261,5,B000E3LD3Q,"I bought the DVD and I thought it was kind of expensive but I needed it so badly, and I was not disappointed at all. She is real, she does not cut all the mistakes she does, the ones behind her miss steps and it looks just like you and me. Love it , love it, love it. Do not hesitate.",1288137600,,284,3.6721311475409837
8105262,5,B000E3LD3Q,"This set consists of 2 DVDs, one is intermediate, the other advanced. Both contain step and hi/lo cardio. The advanced DVD also has a 30 minute crosstraining section for each (step and hi/lo) which is just awesome and easier to follow than some of the cardio-only sections. There are basically 4 major workouts, but it is pretty easy to just select parts of the workouts to make it shorter, mix it up, or add on to something else. A real plus is also, that there is no advertising or introduction to wait through before you can begin. You pop it in and it's ready. The music is very motivating and the cueing is right on. The trick is to LISTEN and follow instructions (try it, you'll be surprised what a difference it makes - I was). However, if you're not advanced and enjoy complex choreography don't attempt it, you will be frustrated. On the other hand, if you love Seasun Zieger, Deidre Morris and Franny Bennedetto, you will love this too!",1268352000,3,946,4.538011695906433
8105263,5,B000E3LD3Q,"I have several DVD's by Christie and by far she is the best step and Hi-Lo cardio instructor out there!  Her cuing is superb, she tells you at least 4 beats before what is coming next.  She breaks down each step and then layers on the complexities so that even a person with 2 left feet like me can follow.  (Of course, I do have to rewind and go back sometimes but I can still follow)!  Her routines are fun and never boring.  This DVD is an especially good deal as it has 4 different routines for the low price of one.  There are 2 90 minute routines broken into 2 25 minute cardio sections, the first moderate choreography, the next complex and  one 20 minute aerotone/circuit training section The last 2 routines are 60 minutes each of cardio.  I have only totally learned one routine but look forward to learning the other 3.  A workout for the brain and the body!  I love it!",1242172800,,881,4.284848484848485
8105264,2,B000E3LD3Q,"I would classify myself as an intermediate exerciser, and I love working out at home. So the reviews made this sound like a good set of workouts. I will admit I'm not classically trained in dance - and maybe that's the problem here.
The step workout is so complicated that I almost twisted my ankle spinning on the step. It's impossible to keep up with her, because she adds 4 moves at one time instead of gradually. Then once you almost figure those out, she's on to the next.
Then I tried one of the dance ones. While I was able to avoid breaking any bones on this one, I still could barely keep up. She doesn't stop talking the entire time, which shows she constantly is changing things, making it hard for the viewer to anticipate what's next.
I found that trying to figure out what she's doing prohibited me from focusing on the move (as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kathy-Kaehler-Basics-Workout-Class/dp/B00068WRNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kathy Kaehler Basics - Workout Class</a>&nbsp;says) and really getting a good, sweaty workout.
Also the people in the back of her workout are supposed to stay at the easier level and I found that 25% of the tape they did not.
I would say this is definitely not for beginners, and not for anyone who didn't major in dance in college.",1233705600,4,1326,5.031818181818182
8105265,5,B000E3LD3Q,"This is absolutely the best DVD I have! It gives a huge variety of workouts. You can step or you can do floor aerobics or you can use weights! It has chapters, so it is easy to combine the different workouts! GREAT! LOVE IT!",1209945600,,224,4.113636363636363
8105266,3,B000E3LD3Q,"This product consist of 2 dvd, but I just enjoy the first dvd, because the second one needs equipment, it is not practical.
At the first dvd, some exercise are the same as another Taylor's product : cardio gold. Not good enough, jangan dibeli om, yg lain masih banyak yg apik, mboseni",1208908800,,284,4.480769230769231
8105267,5,B000E3LD3Q,"Great Step DVD and much more.  Dance, 2 step workouts, aerobics. Great music, great combos, great cueing.  This was one of Health Magazine's award winner.  There is 5 hrs of workout.  Will definitely order more of her videos.",1204329600,,225,4.842105263157895
8105268,2,B000E3LD3Q,I'm used to Kathy Smith and Michelle Dozois and I was just looking to try out some different instructors to mix it up a little.  Well the cueing seems to occur almost half way through the step(s) which makes it difficult and frustrating to follow.  Unfortunately dissappointed :(,1201824000,,279,4.791666666666667
