Great performances by Tom Arnold, Kirsten Lea, Vincent De Paul (these last two also in the Award Winning Silver Case with Oscar Nominee Eric Roberts) and many others... I really enjoyed it at the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival screening in November.",1322611200,,376,5.080645161290323
4830213,5,B005LTDW0U,"Remedy the winter chill this year with an adorable comedy with plenty of LA sun. Its a refreshing twist on the tried and true Freaky Friday premise with delightful performances and timely themes.

4830217,5,B005LTDW0U,"I saw this at the Hoboken film festival in New York, where it won several awards including Best Supporting Actor for Tom Archdeacon and Best Supporting Actress for Kirsten Lea.  I would describe it as a cross between Freaky Friday and In & Out. I find it really difficult to find a movie that's perfect for all our family to watch at Christmas, but this this one will do the trick. I'm definitely going to show it this year. It's better than Four Christmas' with Reece Witherspoon. I even recommended it to all the other Moms at work who were searching for something the holidays.",1321401600,,580,4.523809523809524
4830218,5,B005LTDW0U,"This movie is just THE perfect Christmas day movie.  It is funny, endearing and will definitely make you laugh and warm your heart. Loved Kirsten Lea and Nathaniel Martson, both great comedians!  Simply a great movie which I urge you all to get and watch with a great big bag of popcorn!",1321401600,,287,4.5
4830219,5,B005LTDW0U,"I didn't expect to enjoy this film so much as I'm not a great fan of comedy but found it well acted and amusing. The theme of 2 men - one straight, one gay, experiencing how it felt to be in each others shoes, is probably not original but was portrayed in an amusing and catchy way. The opening sequence showed just how much young minds can be influenced by bigoted people and the end sequence portrayed the irony of how people change their views. I would give a special mention to Kirsten Lea who gave an endearing performance as the bewildered girlfriend who finds the love of her life changing before her just as she's ready to commit. A definite hit in time for Christmas viewing!",1321401600,2,684,4.393700787401575
4830220,5,B005LTDW0U,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and its take on culture bias. We have come a long way as a group (country) for sure, but a group (country) is made up of individuals from a wide spectrum. This film focuses on individuals who still, on a micro-level, rely on stereotypes to form beliefs (Balancing out with characters who are progressive as well).

Growing up in the 70s, the main character spoke to me as a modern-day Archie Bunker, bias for sure, meat-headed in a funny way.  We see there is hope for growth through teachable moments based in both humor and cold reality.",1504137600,,570,4.578431372549019
4830221,5,B005LTDW0U,"Ridiculous...in all the right ways.  Part slapstick, part satire, and a clever use of stereotypes to make an important point.  It's a good flick.",1500768000,,145,5.0
4830222,1,B005LTDW0U,"Not sure where are the 5 stars are coming from but this was not a good movie. The acting was ""ok"" at best but it wasn't the acting that caused me to dislike it, nor was it the over played and over done ""magically trading places"" theme. What was disturbing to me about this film is that stereotypes that were perpetuated in it.

When the ""straight guy"" becomes ""gay"" he suddenly stops to smell flowers, likes to dance, cook and other things. And when the ""gay"" guy becomes ""straight"" he suddenly likes to eat a meat lovers pizza, drink beer, suddenly knows how to fix cars and wants to learn how to box. HAHA ... what is up with that? Many straight men like to cook, smell flowers, dance, etc and many don't. Many gay men like to eat a meat lovers pizza, drink beer, know how to fix cars and know how to box and many don't.

This movie makes it seem as if a man is ""gay"" then he must also have effeminate traits or be somehow effeminate himself and that just isn't the case. There are many effeminate ""straight"" and ""gay"" men just as there are many masculine ""gay"" and ""straight"" men. I get the fact that they went in this direction as it played well with the plot of the movie but if anything I felt it was a bit more destructive than enlightening.",1499212800,2,1248,4.239495798319328
4830223,5,B005LTDW0U,"Fun, sweet movie...with an important message.  The time-honored ""trading places"" trope, but with a timely twist. I recommend it!",1487635200,,128,5.7368421052631575
4830224,5,B005LTDW0U,"This is a funny, charming movie that should be a perennial favorite during the Christmas season. Well written, well acted and just plain makes you feel good!

This indie movie is full of heart and albeit based on fantastical elements it emotionally honest and very entertaining!",1487548800,,278,5.043478260869565
4830225,5,B005LTDW0U,"Walk a Mile in My Pradas, written, produced and featuring Rick Sudi Karatas and Tom Archdeacon, takes the familiar comedic device of two people who, through mysterious magic, wind up switching identities; in this case, sexual orientation identities.

The storyline involves two guys who could not be more opposite of each other. Tony (Nathaniel Marston) is an ultra-macho straight man who is pathologically homophobic. Steve (Mr. Archdeacon) is an openly gay man who prides himself on his fashion sense. (He enjoys showing off his Prada shoes.) Things get going when, at a Christmas party that they both find themselves uncomfortably in each others company, Steve, having taken enough of Tonys bullying, wishes him to know what it is like to be gay. Tony, in return, wishes that Steve were straight so that he would see how disgusting he is being gay. As these curses are exchanged, a Christmas angel lights up several times. Little-by-little, the wishes of Tony and Steve begin to take form.

To describe the plot any further would rob the reader of a movie that is funny, touching, and thought-provoking about the differences and similarities of people; and how much alike everyone is when it comes down to the basics of life.

Props to cast which include Kirsten Lea as Tonys refined and sexy fianc, Emrhys Cooper as Steves boyfriend, and Mr. Karatas as one of Tonys construction coworkers. Additionally, familiar performers Tom Arnold, Dee Wallace, and Mike Starr are featured. (Oh, and writer and Hollywood Square staple Bruce Vilanch figures very importantly in this film.)

Walk a Mile in My Pradas  a movie that can be enjoyed by all, regardless of who they are and who they love. As stated, it simply proves that people are more alike than they think. Congrats to Mr. Karatas and Mr. Archdeacon.",1487376000,2,1804,4.960264900662252

I'm glad that I got the chance and I want to say that whoever you are in life, if there's someone you don't ""get"" then this will pave the way to.

4830250,1,B005LTDW0U,"Let's forget about the notion of linking homophobia with strange childhood trauma. Both Tony and Steve spend a lot of the movie acting out various stereotypes for straights and gays alike. Since Tony is now gay. he gains the magical ability to cook even though he had never done this before. Steve in turn has inherited a magical understanding of automobiles just because he's straight now.

And of course we come to the ""problem"" that both are in committed relationships that are on the brink of marriage. Since their sexuality  alignments have been switched, this means that their relationships now fall apart since they can't have sex with one another. Sure, they remember their lives together and all the challenges that they had faced as couples. But because their sexual organs no longer respond to the right gender identity, they can't be in their relationships anymore.

There are a million other ways that the writers could have explored the whole gender swap concept without going down such a cliched path. Sure, I know it's supposed to be a shallow comedy, but we can certainly do so much better than this. Comedies don't necessarily have to resort to being dumb and offensive in order to get laughs (and I can't really folks laughing in this movie apart for the odd Tom Arnold expression). There's such a thing as wit and humor that does require intelligence to write but not necessarily to appreciate and understand.

And I don't even get the need to set this movie during the Christmas season. What is this, a Die Hard movie? If you want to go see a good LGBT themed holiday movie, go see Make The Yuletide Gay. It's not out of this world amazing, but it's still worlds better than this one.

Walk A Mile In My Pradas is a horrible movie. Don't waste your time.",1391731200,2,1775,4.676282051282051
4830251,4,B005LTDW0U,"I came across this movie on Netflix and decided to give it a go. Now I already go into alot of the gay cinema not expecting much as there are alot of bombs out there but every so often one does come along that I will watch twice.
Reading a few of the other reviews I never took the movie so serious and never looked at any sterotypes. I just took the film for what it was worth. Sure you had one character that was sooo straight and homophobic and the other who was so gay but lets face it, there are indeed ""some"" that are that way. Its not saying that everyone is like that. I have always wondered what would it be like for the other to see what it can be like if the shoe was indeed on the other foot. And I liked the way they chose a few ""extremes"" to have one not accept his/her sexuality like shock therapy to seeing a outragoues preist. Now, Thats funny. The cast was pretty good and actually pretty well acted. I liked the way that they were trying to get a point across without being so serious. Worth a watch.",1368489600,2,1019,4.0495049504950495
4830252,2,B005LTDW0U,"Not the worst movie-it was coherent and nicely flowing but I didn't find it humorous as I supposed. I might be heterosexual but even I found the stereotypes to be offensive! A gay man does not necessarily have to be ""unmanly"" or love garish pink clashed with orange. In fact, usually they dress pretty snazzy not the opposite. And they don't all have to love chardonnay, some of them are truthfully indistinguishable from regular heterosexuals although some do dress different (male or female) some gays dress pretty femininely and some lesbians quite butch.

However, just because you're gay doesn't mean you know how to cook, flowers, and change what types of movies you like. I think Broke Back Mountains sucks, and not because it's 'gay'. I also disliked how they portrayed the homosexual character who turned momentarily heterosexual. He treated his partner very callously, and even if he was not attracted to him he could have been as respectful as the heterosexual male who turned gay was to his fiance. Even though he was not attracted to her he tried not to hurt her feelings.

I did like how they had the brief scene with the psychologist trying to electrocute him to being straight because they did it in a ridiculous manner (it would have killed him in real life and was used turn of the century at asylums) and also how it demonstrated a prejudiced reverend that was preaching how all homosexuals would go to hell because of their lustful sins because the reverend seemed farcical and pathetic. They made it a light and funny but those are serious topics. Some psychologist (and I don't consider them good ones at that) actually try to counsel people until they are straight. Which is frankly ridiculous.

I admit, being a girl who gets turned on at the thought of two guys making out I though this would be a funny comedy in contrasts. Instead I found myself disappointed at the portrayal of homosexuals in this film.

Heck! Even heterosexuals-no way would an attractive girl fall for an ugly overweight dorky balding older man (especially a perverse one with money problems who only wants to get in your pants and not a relationship) and the overweight girl was also mocked. They were unnecessary elements that just made this even staler.

All in all, disappointing.",1344988800,5,2281,4.808673469387755
4830253,2,B005LTDW0U,"Once again we have a movie for straight people classified as ""gay"" because it has a gay character in it. This one even has a gay/straight theme, but if it was made by or for gay people they must be self-loathing gay people.

Who thinks it's funny to see a straight man turn gay? straight women. Who thinks it's funny to see a gay man turn straight? straight men. I guess there are also people who think magical role-reversal movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaky-Friday/dp/B003QSLBFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaky Friday</a>&nbsp;are hilarious and don't care what roles are being exchanged; and people who guffaw at extremely obvious lowbrow sitcom humor no matter what the subject is. As a gay man who outgrew adolescent squirming a long time ago, I find this kind of garbage annoying. I don't see how even straight people can find this relentlessly offensive and mean-spirited ""humor"" entertaining (the vicious ridicule of a desperate straight fat girl is especially appalling).

Being gay is wonderful. If changing sexual orientation were possible (and it's not), I wouldn't turn straight if you gave me a billion dollars, and I really mean it. Any gay man who thinks being gay is something that should make a straight man squirm and pee in his pants - who thinks switching sexual orientation is funny - either is an idiot or secretly (or not so secretly) wishes he weren't gay. This movie is pretty well done for its inherently offensive kind, but if a single cent of gay money went into making it, the ones who invested that money should rethink their priorities.",1341187200,7,1628,5.186311787072244
4830254,4,B005LTDW0U,"I admit I'm prejudice I like Sudi and I personally know how long it took to do this independent film. Although he had name players involved and willing to help him get his project off because they believed in it, he did not have big Hollywood $$$. This movie also took more years than you know to get done in the meantime people came up and produced movies with similar themes. That's Hollywood, it happens. I liked the movie and was happy to see some rewrites were done. I didn't give 5 stars because there were issues that I think should not be on a finished product. That's just me. I love my friends but I'm honest. I hope people buy this movie and rent it because I'd love to see the next movie by these writers and director. I feel we need to support those trying to do good works and this is something you can watch and not be ashamed to watch.

I did really laugh out loud at a few parts and the leading men are engaging, especially the straight one who turns gay. He might seem bigoted but it's not done in an overly mean way, so you can still take it like a good ribbing from a straight buddy almost.",1330128000,,530,4.105769230769231

In a time when every movie seems to rehash the same old story, this put a whole new spin on the Freaky Friday device.  And it was also really moving and touching in all the right places.  It is a  really solid throughout.  From a comedy standpoint, Tom Arnold steals this movie, and seems to have made it better than it should've been.  He is hilarious - and surprisingly sweet in very scene, which makes me think he is a much deeper actor than I had given him credit for in the past.  The main actors who play Tony and Steve were SUPERB - both funny, charming, soulful and real!  Also - I always love Dee Wallace!",1329177600,,712,4.222222222222222
