5346276,1,B009L63QGE,"One reviewer here said how much his kids enjoyed this....I hope the kids were in their 20's. On the strength of his comment I went ahead and rented it for my kids and me (we love ""Rocketman""). This is FILTHY!! Starts out filthy and escalates from there. Unless you like constant jokes (so called) about orgasms, oral sex and so on...avoid this like the plague. worst 5 minute movie rental of my life.",1370131200,3,400,4.493150684931507
5346277,5,B009L63QGE,"Like an unhinged, bizarre, extremely funny train wreck... this is Harland Williams' finest work.
A must watch for turtle lovers.",1366156800,,128,5.45
5346278,3,B009L63QGE,"This stand-up show was done without an audience. It would have been better in front of a live audience. I felt like I was the only person in a comedy club watching his act , but it was still good. I'm a Harland Williams fan anyway so what the heck. My grand kids could not stop laughing when I showed it to them , they loved it. They like goofy comedians , and he does a good job.",1365724800,,380,3.8846153846153846
5346279,5,B009L63QGE,"To anyone who has seen Harland before this,you already know he is an oddball.(understatement I know)To do a standup special in this way has the uniqueness of never having been tried before,(to the best of my knowledge) no audience to cue us(the home viewer) when to laugh is just brilliant! Watched it twice already & find that I hear something that I might have missed the first time watching it in my second viewing,I'm sure that future viewings will most likely do the same. Perfect addition to my standup dvd collection.",1363305600,,524,4.769230769230769
5346280,5,B009L63QGE,"This show is wildly entertaining!  If you like Harland, without a doubt, you'll eat this up.  He is so unique . . . and never tired.  I'm so glad he went for this.  I encourage fans, and those not even sure, to pick this up.  Glad I did!!!",1362182400,,239,3.8958333333333335
5346281,4,B009L63QGE,"Crazy comedy in the middle of the desert. Fans of his podcast will enjoy this as it's pretty much a complement to his Harland Highway show. The funniest parts are the ""spontaneous"" moments (don't know if they were staged or not) such as having to go to the bathroom in a desert in the middle of his act and when he gets pissed off at hecklers in the ""audience"".

Nice job Harland.

From a Korean fan who enjoys your Chinese impressions... But where are the Korean impressions?",1361059200,,476,4.459770114942529
5346282,5,B009L63QGE,"In a world of copycats and cookie-cutter observation humor, thank God there's still a place for oddball funnymen like Martin Short, Chris Elliott, and Harland Williams.  Harland is like NO ONE else, and this DVD is a great way to enjoy that unique Harland humor.  The enitre thing is Harland in a nutshell - strange, funny,unafraid.  He's the kid in 3rd grade who acts up for laughs.  The teachers all told us to ""just ignore"" those kids, but we knew they were hilarious.",1360627200,3,471,4.63855421686747
5346283,5,B009L63QGE,Harland Williams is the funniest man on the planet and if you like him this is him at his finest. His insightful jokes really make you think about life. This high brow dvd packed with jokes about everything important will make you laugh for days.,1360454400,2,246,4.488888888888889
5346284,3,B009L63QGE,"Was pretty good the first time Harland did the joke but a Lot of this is repeats,

STILL GOOD!!

I laughed hard a few times at the beginning.",1360368000,,141,4.0
5346285,1,B009L63QGE,"Let me first say that I think that Harland is very funny in a way that is unique to him.  I don't know any other comedian like him.  I heard him promoting this special on the Adam Carolla Show and I thought I would check it out.  What a waste.  This is, by far, the worst comedy special I have ever seen.  I think I know why they took the audience out of the special, and it is probably because they would not laugh at this material.  I hardly cracked a smile the entire time.  If you want to see the funniest parts (for lack of a better word), watch the preview and it captures it all.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1359676800,5,612,3.959016393442623
8542776,1,B009L63QGE,What happened to this guy?  I actually logged into my account to leave this review.  No wonder this is on the prime list.  I would have regretted an actual purchase.  Come on Harland.  You are better than this!,1505001600,,210,4.421052631578948
8542777,1,B009L63QGE,I will use this as a much more severe punishment than grounding my sons for a month,1499385600,,83,3.9411764705882355
8542778,1,B009L63QGE,"Not sure if it is the weird choice of venue (none), or that the guy is just not funny.  Perhaps a bit of both.",1492560000,,110,3.5833333333333335
8542779,5,B009L63QGE,Harland Williams has to be the funniest man on earth,1456617600,,52,4.3
8542780,3,B009L63QGE,"As a comic, I found this performance to be a learning experience.  It's fascinating.

My thoughts on this for anyone who is not a comic: You'll be looking at your phone through most of this.",1415577600,,190,4.4
8542781,2,B009L63QGE,"The idea is sound. Comedy without the assistance of an audience, my problem is not the jokes they are ok. Not Harland's best but they are ok. The problem is Harland continually breaks the very concept by constantly saying ""huh?"" as if he is awaiting an audience's response. I could forgive some nature dead silence as he transitions or holds for what he ordinary would suspect were laughs, but his desire to fill the silence caused by his own choice of venue destroys this for me. I think a stronger comic could do this to perfect, or even a more elaborate comic. For as much as Harland is proving that funny doesn't need an Ed Mcmahon telling you when to giggle, he needs the noise to help him face the desolation of his surroundings. His best more fluid stuff happens when nature provide him the audience he claims he doesn't need.  If you are a REALLY big Harland fan, get it. If you are just curious of the idea, rent it. Someone will do this better, but give credit to he who did it first.",1398902400,,994,4.372972972972973
8542782,3,B009L63QGE,"Harland is my favorite comedian, but this isn't his best.  The lack of audience for him to pay off of, and judge his material doesn't help. The way he normally banters with the audience is my favorite part.",1382140800,2,206,4.421052631578948
8542783,4,B009L63QGE,"Harland Williams pulls off this unique concept of doing stand up to himself in the desert pretty well. It's an entertaining show, and if you start getting bored, Harland will SUNFLOWER SEED your ass! And if you need good vibes, he sprinkles CINNAMON!!! I'd watch this again later - very funny stuff.",1381017600,,299,4.769230769230769
8542784,2,B009L63QGE,"In this case, it's because the cover is the ONLY thing funny about this dvd!

I'm sorry to say that. I gave it a shot, I wanted to like it. However, this really looked much more like a desperate flailing than ""comic genius""...

I've heard this film described as ""genius"", ""bold"", ""inventive"", ""courageous""...because of THIS??? Are we talking about the same DVD? I wanted to believe that perhaps it was a slow-starter...I got maybe a chuckle and a half out of it, TOPS...And the guy whom I was watching this with couldn't stand seeing any more. So much so, he actually got up to shut it off well before it finished. So I have to judge based on what I saw. It never hit it's stride from what I did see, so it's pretty safe to assume it never charged out the gate at any point.

WAS this an attempt to re-invent stand up?? OR...Could it be, perhaps, he's REALLY out all alone on a barren desert mountaintop because he's trying to hide the fact that he CAN'T wrangle up an audience? At least, not for THAT material anyway. So, perhaps those lauding him with those above adjectives of praise are themselves fooled? (Or perhaps some of those overly enthusiastic 5 star reviews are SHILLS...nudge-nudge, wink-wink)

But I will credit him for solving an age-long riddle to life: If an unfunny joke is uttered where no one is around to hear it...it's STILL unfunny!

The crickets wouldn't even muster up a chirp during the everlong gaps of awkward silence between ""jokes"", what does THAT tell you about what ""Mother Nature"" thinks of his little foray? lol But, this time, a foray against which, I wonder? Of nature or of comedy? LOL

I agree with the other reviewer: stand-up comics need audiences MUCH MORE than audiences need them...and for him to just scoff that elementary concept, it adds a slight insult to the injury of the lack of humor on this film.

Stop to think a moment: HE DOES need an audience (of SOME kind) after all, if he expects people to buy this dvd, doesn't he? How can he do this act without an audience, insisting he doesn't need one, drop a dud, then look all around doing the ""hello, is this thing on?"" schtick by repeating/redelivering/re-explaining the punchline? Yeah, I got it the first time. It was DOA. Get THAT.

I saw him live one night at the Laugh Factory in Hollywood not too long ago. He was sharing the stage with several other acts. Let me put it to you this way: for his 10 minutes of time, he spent about 7 of it drawing out (more like stalling, which became more & more obvious as time went on) the anticipation for ONE joke whose punchline was tepid at best. Then, when he found he couldn't wring any more reaction out of that one thing, he's all ""Oops! That's my time! Thanks, goodnight!"" when, by the emcee's expression, clearly it wasn't his time. Holy crap, even Dane Cook (who went on the same night) was funnier than this dude! I swear, it was as if the club manager woke him up that same morning to book him to do the show that very night. The sad part? He was booked well in advance...In fact, his name on the roster played a part in my decision to see the show! So, maybe you can imagine my disappointment!

I don't know what happened to H.W. I think his time in the desert would have been much better spent taking up a vision quest: Either it'll A) help reconnect him back to his funny (it seems like, on some level, he KNOWS he's lost it)...or B) give him a new direction on what to do with his life.",1375747200,7,3447,4.398744113029827
8542785,1,B009L63QGE,"For your own good, don't buy this. It was just a chore to watch. I may have laughed out loud (barely) once or twice, but most of it just comes across as an insane, desperate comedian, ranting to himself in the desert. Why would you do a comedy special without an audience? Harland says it's because viewers shouldn't need to hear an audience laughing to know where to laugh...unfortunately, stand up comedians need audiences a lot more than viewers do. I don't know exactly why, maybe it's because laughter is contagious, maybe it's because it throws off his timing, I don't know. But one thing I do know is that this just wasn't funny. Save yourself the money, time, and regret...and if you really want this DVD, I'll let mine go for a buck or two. Like new condition, I guarantee it will have only been watched once.",1370390400,4,818,4.533783783783784
