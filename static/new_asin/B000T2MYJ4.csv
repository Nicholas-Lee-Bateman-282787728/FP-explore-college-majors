8207585,5,B000T2MYJ4,"Lets get one thing out of the way first this movie is no way original. To international foreign movie watchers this movie is a rip-off of a Korean film called ""a bittersweet life"" but it doesn't matter at this point as many people know by now bollywood borrows ideas from any source material but its how they take these inspirations and use them in their own style.

Awarapan is grim movie taking place in a Chinese setting with a themes of slavery and religion and how the correlation between the two couldn't be similar and different.

The film will mess with your emotions if you know heading into it what your going to watch...a love story or a tragic one at that.

The characters are all well acted and the movie keeps you intrigued throughout and the end will satisfy you in a heart touching way.

Music is by far some of the best I've heard in a bollywood film it's a nice mix of melodic lyrics with soothing beats and rhythm to make you feel heartwarmingly calm and sad but it fits perfectly with the story and characters.

If your a fan of emraan hashmi then you probably already watched this one and know how good it is. Personally this is his best movie and one that I'm most proud of watching anytime. If your new to his films or just missed a few watch ""Awarapan"" you won't regret it.",1377907200,,1297,4.365145228215767
