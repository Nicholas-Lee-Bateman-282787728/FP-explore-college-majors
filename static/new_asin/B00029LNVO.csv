Overall this is a great DVD!

Please note that if you saw Hilary's Most Wanted Tour 2004, this is not that tour show! So it does not feature her new songs: Weird, Haters, Do You Want Me, Rock This World, Fly, or Our Lips Are Sealed performed with her sister Haylie Duff. This is the DVD for the Metamorphosis tour 2003/2004 (from November 2003 - March 2004 shows). Buy this DVD! Hilary rocks!",1091232000,10,1027,4.345744680851064

2069812,5,B00029LNVO,this is a very cool songs dvd i love this music and u should to hilary rocks,1186272000,,76,3.5294117647058822
2069813,5,B00029LNVO,"This DVD is excellent.  Hilary Duff puts on a good, entertaining show for her fans.  The band is good and the music sounds good.  Hilary's voice is just fine.  Most notably, the concert is simply a lot of good, wholesome fun.  It's a welcome break at times from ""serious"" or angry or controversial stuff.  Hilary obviously enjoys performing for her fans and has fun on stage.  She interacts well with the band members; they appear as part of a friendly team.  She acknowledges her fans.  The rest of the DVD, the stuff besides the concert, is also very good.  There is a clip of Hilary on a show with Ryan Seacrest, clips of making videos, clips of Hilary out and about, including surfing and shopping, and footage of behind the scenes at the concerts, including interviews of band members.  Throughout, Hilary comes off as a very pleasant and likeable person.  Not like some other performers who are jerks, or drunks, or pervs, etc.  A must-have for Hilary fans and a worthwhile view for everyone else too.",1172448000,2,1007,4.653409090909091
2069814,5,B00029LNVO,"If you're wondering what the Hilary hype is all about, but haven't had a chance to catch her in concert, this is the next best thing. You don't have to be a diehard fan of Hilary's (mostly) pop tunes to enjoy this look at her first tour promoting her album Metamorphosis, and the DVD's title is well deserved. ""Working It Out"" particularly shines, displaying the type of energy Duff is capable of creating onstage. Recommended for both longtime fans and newbies.",1140652800,5,462,4.716049382716049
2069815,5,B00029LNVO,"Tuve el honor de estar presente en el concierto que se ocupo para filmar este video. La verdad que trataron de dar conocer a los fans, es lo que muchos vivimos en lo que se podr&iacute;a decir la mejor experiencia de mi vida, el poder ver a mi artista favorito a no menos de 1 metro, fue algo maravilloso, Esta sensaci&oacute;n la podr&aacute;n vivir todos a sus casas por que este video esta bien filmado y nos deja disfrutar de la experiencia como si estuvi&eacute;ramos ah&iacute;. Se los recomiendo tiene adicionalmente unos videos que son muy buenos de algunos &eacute;xitos del disco Metamorphosis.",1139356800,2,604,4.87378640776699
2069816,4,B00029LNVO,"This was a very well made recording. The video production of the concert and audio quality of the instrumental band was extremely high. Interesting editing choices: the recording is a combination of two concerts and two very different venues. The voice dubbing for Hilary was an interesting choice, and I personally wish they hadn't done the dub--Hilary's vocals rock live. The real gem of this DVD are in its behind the scenes features. Seeing her practice with her band is such a great feature, and seeing her and her sister tour the bus for the first time. The Making of ""Come Clean"" was another great feature, and I appreciate Buena Vista Home Entertainment including the full video for ""Come Clean."" I look forward to seeing Ms. Duff's next concert recording, with full live recording of vocals.",1138838400,2,800,4.889705882352941
2069817,2,B00029LNVO,"I noticed this dvd when it was first released. As i picked it up in a music store, i had a question mark boggling in my mind, ""THE GIRL CAN ROCK?"". I resisted. I put it down and walked away. But Hilary knows how to draw her fans in. A week later, i owned it. I had to see if she could rock. I'm sorry to say, no she can't rock.

As the 50 minute concert came to an end after i first watched it, i wondered why the title is ""The Girl Can Rock"". I'm sorry to all the devotees who have have praised the crap out of Hilary in the ""live"" concert, but she mimes! Yes, she really does! I don't know how the majority of reviewers on this site have said ""It's live!"", ""She rocks!"". Have these people seen this concert? They say she doesn't mime. But theres proof everywhere that she's miming! In the last chorus of ""COME CLEAN"", Hilary bangs her head (ROCK!) but listen to her voice! It's sublte and smooth, no glitchs or anything! And if any of the reviewers here have her album (Metamorphosis) or even heard it, they should know she's using pre-recorded vocals. Her vocals are EXACTLY the same as the CD. It's not live. Why does she mime? It's not like she's putting on a ""showgirl"" show. She doesn't even dance! All she does is walk from side to side of the stage.

Overall, the concert was a let down! The closest thing to interesting on this dvd were the special features, behind the scenes, video clips and interviews. Not really value for money, but clever marketing (as always with Duff).

Why are all these ""artist"" afraid to admit their music is pop? Hilary says she's rock, Lindsay says she's rock, Ashlee says she's rock, Britney says she's hip hop! ""Pop"" is not a bad word. They're not fooling anyone but themselves.

Lastly i have to say, i may not seem like it, but i am a Hilary Duff fan. I really like her but i was just being honest which is something all reviewers should be on this site. You're not being disloyale to the artist for having an honest and realistic opinion.",1131321600,5,1983,4.28
2069827,5,B00029LNVO,My granddaughter loved the concert as we have been to see Hilary Duff in a real concert.,1127952000,,88,4.235294117647059
2069828,5,B00029LNVO,"Purchased for my 11 yr old daughter, but I enjoyed it very much. Any Hilary Duff fan should have it. Just went to see her in concert at Konocti Harbor (Clearlake/Kelseyville). I wish I could have gotten away with just the DVD, because I'd prefer the comfort of my living room big screen TV. For the price of the tickets, the BBQ included with the reserved seating, the gas to get there, motel, T-Shirts, 16 signed photos (for daughter's birthday sleepover party friends), it was definitely worth it, for my daughter. It was her birthday gift!!! She chose that over a horse!! I believe that Hilary will metamorph to a rock queen. The band was great, and the drummer was unbelievable (a girl)! There was a slight problem with one of the songs, like they lost the echo or whatever it is that gives your voice depth. But, that happened almost at the end of the concert. I think that Hilary has a lot of stage presence, both on her DVD and in concert. I bet it is a little embarrassing to her to be idolized by the 6-12 year old population, when she'd rather be appealing to the 14-30 crowd. I have to say, I saw a lot of 14-30 year olds rocking out at the concert. Was surprised to see all the tattoos on the lead guitarist, and his hair was looking like a bad hair day, but boy, could he play. The guy on the keyboard was fantastic too!! The whole band wass great. The opening act was a guy whose name I can't remember, and don't need to remember. His trio was forgettable, but at least he entertained us while we all waited for Hilary. I am going to watch the video again today to see if the  lead band is the same. This was my first live concert, but not my last. The DVD is a great alternative for those that can't afford the live concert. I think EVERY performer enhances their vocals, unless you  hear them with no mike and no band. How many can sound good without all the trappings. Hilary has so much energy, and puts on a great show!! Was funny that she has the same clothes on, rolled up shorts, big ring on her finger, red nails, and the rhinestone pin on the cuff of her shorts. I think this will end up being a fashion for the 9-14 year old fans!! Already my daughter is checking out my vintage rhinestone pins to wear with the shorts she plans on rolling up. One thing, though.....Hilary is too thin, and looks more like her sister now. Maybe it's just genes, but I was a little alarmed when I first saw her weight loss, but then noticed her defined thigh and calf muscles.....so she must be working out a lot. I assured my daughter that she's just getting thin because she's touring. I'm going to buy another DVD for my daughter's friend, who is also a HD fan. She has changed a lot, since her Lizzie McGuire days, but don't all kids?? Great DVD!!!!",1127606400,3,2760,4.28544061302682

2069831,5,B00029LNVO,"I just bought this DVD today and watched it. It's awesome! It includes tons of things that every Hilary fan will want to watch. If you're a Hilary fan, this is for you! It shows Hilary live in concert for thirteen songs.

Here are the songs: (NOT in order of performace)

  So Yesterday, Come Clean, Workin' It Out, Little Voice, Where Did I Go Right?, Anywhere But Here, The Math, Love Just Is, Sweet Sixteen, Party Up, Metamorphosis, Why Not, and Girl Can Rock.

There's also behind the scenes. You get to see behind the scences of Hilary's Metamorphosis Tour. Come in the tour bus with Hilary and watch all her rehersals and her first show. She tells you all about going on tour and what you have to do and stuff. There's behind the scenes of singing in the studio, and a peek at Hilary singing Crash World, off the Cinderella Story soundtrack. Another behind the scenes is on the Come Clean music video. It's really cool to see how they really made the video. It shows how the video is made, and clips of the video. The video for Come Clean is also on the DVD, along with a video of a live So Yesterday performance.

The other bonus features include Ryan Seacrest interviewing Hilary. It's a great interview! I watched it three times! LOL! There's Hilary Hangs Ten, which is a clip of Hilary surfing. There's a cool photo gallery of cool Hilary photos. There are small clips of commercials about Hilary.

Overall, I'd give this DVD a 10/10. It's awesome, and a must have for any Hilary fan. It's very entertaining and interesting, and something that you could watch over and over again. It's awesome! I love it!",1122595200,3,1615,4.510273972602739
2069832,1,B00029LNVO,I purchased this DVD for my two daughters for Christmas. Both are big fans of Hillary and I even enjoyed her until I tried watching the DVD with them. The audio portion is incredibly TERRIBLE. Lots of poor lip sync during the concert. The singing is so quiet you can hardly hear it. The music drowns it out. I can't believe they are selling this item with such poor quality. Don't waste your money! Even my 2 daughters of 9 and 5 have little interest in the DVD because it seems so fake and poorly produced.,1111276800,2,507,4.291666666666667
2069862,5,B00029LNVO,I thought that this DVD rocked. It is so good and there is so many extras. I loved it and it is something that you can watch over and over again. hilary Duff is at her best on this DVD and it shows what a great voice she has. Everyone who says that cant sing are wrong. she may not be the best singer in the worlkd but she still has a fantastic voice that I love. This DVD is a must have for all Hilary Duff fans,1108339200,3,412,3.6931818181818183
2069863,5,B00029LNVO,"This DVD was incredible. It is a must have for all hilary fans. If any hilary fan does not have this DVD, they are totally missing out on the real hilary. Hilary is at her best in this DVD, please help hilary with the sales of this DVD, it is really worth your money.",1099612800,8,267,3.962962962962963
2069864,1,B00029LNVO,"My little niece has this DVD, and to say it in the most sympathetic way i can, it is awfully terrible. ok, first off, hillary duff can't sing for her life, not even the lip - synching helps. Second of all, its all prerecorded, and you can tell because during the show i noticed the rubber flaps underneath the cymbals whenever the drummer would hit them (they stop any real noise from coming for the drums). As for the guitarists, I watched them very carefully, they don't hit any of the chords they are really hitting, and exactly HOW DO YOU GET A DRUM MACHINE IN THAT quickly if its not already recorded, its impossible (and plus a drum machine comes from a keyboard, but the drummer was ""playing it""). The bassist was just hitting random notes too. THe whole things a big sham. I can tell because i myself am a musician, i play everything from blues to heavy metal. And me and any of my band members can tell you that this is pure garbage.",1099526400,7,942,4.327683615819209
2069865,5,B00029LNVO,"I think that releasing this DVD was a very good idea beacuse you can listen to her ""metamorphosis"" album but also watching her how she is on stage.

For example when I bought it I played it with my home theatre I was with my sister and two friends and we were pretending we were really there and we sang the songs out loud and do what Hilary says ha ha it was great!!!.

But another day I sat down to see the bonus material included and I saw her rehearsal and a meeting with some fans (lucky them!!) But the point is that you can see Hilary as herself not only doing what she does better, I can see that she is a very good person, she is living the way it should be for her age enjoying going shopping, being with her sister Haylie etc..

But please buy this if you loved her first album. and Hilary if you ever read this PLEASE COME TO MEXICO!!! you have a lot of fans here.",1098316800,12,876,3.994285714285714
2069866,1,B00029LNVO,"God! I hate Hilary Duff! She always acts & sings so sweet(I have her first album)to trick you! She's not that much of a caring person! First of all, she only has 2 charities! 2! One is a fashion line, and the LAST ONE is just one for kids! Careless! The only person she loves and appreciates is her fricken sister!

Like Lindsay Lohan instead! She's MUCH coller!

P.S. HILARY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

EVEN ASHLEE SIMPSON IS BETTER THAN HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1097280000,,451,4.756410256410256

She really can rock!!  I loved it and I'd reccomend it to every Hilary Fan!!!  (the clip of her learning to surf is great too!)",1096329600,,290,4.125
2069888,4,B00029LNVO,"This is a nice DVD, but not quite what I was expecting.  I am a big Hilary Duff fan, and I was hoping for an awesome live concert, complete with live concert sound.  Quite to the contrary, this concert is more like a big multi-song music video.  I'm not going to go into the details of what's on the DVD... several other reviewers have already done that in great detail.  However, I would like to offer some comments that may influence your thoughts about purchasing this DVD.  For those of you who already own the DVD, you may want to watch it again to see if you notice some of things I mention below.

First, this DVD is apparently a merged combination of two different concerts.  Hilary and her band have different sets of outfits for the two concerts, but they are spliced together every few seconds.  The result is a repeatedly jarring perspective change that feels quite surreal.  The psychological effect is somewhat like watching two television channels at the same time using picture-in-picture.  As I watch the DVD, I find myself unable to commit to one concert or the other because it flips back and forth so frequently.

I believe a concert video should give me the feeling of being inside the arena, drawing me close to the performers as the night goes on.  Instead, this video's fast-paced scene-switching pushes me back, chipping away at my sense of reality.  I could not get the feeling that I was actually there in the concert, because ""there"" was an abstraction that simultaneously represented two different locations!

I am also a bit annoyed because I find one of Hilary's outfits to be more attractive than the other.  If the DVD had stuck to showing just one concert, I could have become accustomed to either outfit... but not both at once!  (That's just my personal irritation.  I'm sure others won't mind.)

Last but not least, the concert's audio is suspect.  Many people complain that Hilary's voice is dubbed.  I agree.  Furthermore, I am almost completely certain that the band is dubbed as well!  I have done audio recording in studio and live environments for years, and I've heard the audio of many live concerts.  The audio on this DVD has a pristine quality to it, but it's a little too clean.  It doesn't have enough mistakes - or at least curiosities - in it to be truly live.

I speak as though it ought to be a raw, live recording.  But actually, it is common practice to overdub the audio on ""live"" recordings.  Certain tracks may be left as-is to keep a stable foundation (for example, keyboard and bass), but the drums, guitars, and other instruments sometimes get edited for clarity.  My personal opinion is that Hilary's band performed each song ""live"" in an arena with no audience, while being carefully recorded to get good sound quality.  This would produce a clean, live-sounding audio track that could be layered convincingly over any concert video footage.

For anyone who challenges my assertion about the band being dubbed just as much as Hilary's vocal, I would ask you to listen carefully and watch the instrumentalists.  You may catch some ""hand-syncing"" going on (a play on the term, ""lip-syncing"").  Furthermore, even if the concerts were recorded live, which one are we hearing?  There are two concerts going on throughout this DVD, and the audio can't be from both at once.  Small variations in tempo and dynamics would cause them to clash.

In any case, the band sounds fabulous.  So does Hilary.  Somebody worked very hard in the editing room to make the audio sound as good as possible.  Maybe too good.  Some of us would rather hear the mistakes and the raw energy of live, unedited sound.  Nonetheless, I personally find this DVD's audio to be quite enjoyable to listen to.

I give the DVD 4 stars.  If not for the visually disorienting concept of being in two concerts at once, it would have earned 5 stars.",1095724800,5,3871,4.699404761904762
2069889,5,B00029LNVO,"It doesn't seem to be dubbed as far as I can tell.  Hilary is great and so is the band.  The extra's on the cd are really fun.  My daughter loves it.  Don't listen to the nay sayers, the girl can rock!",1095638400,,201,3.7142857142857144
2069890,1,B00029LNVO,"The ability to sing, play an instrument, and write music is worthy of respect. Hillary Duff fails to do any of the 3.

2069892,5,B00029LNVO,"Ok, first off, it's dubbed for the vocals, when I read the reviews that it was dubbed, I decided I wouldn't by this, but who am I kidding. It's Hilary Duff, I bought it anyway, and I was very impressed. Despite it being dubbed, and it's hardly noticeable throughout most of the performances, except Party Up it's very noticeable, but the background music, or the band totaly rocks. The sound is unbelievable and it's just so fun to listen to, it's so worth it just for that. Here's the correct order of how she performs the songs:

The Girl Can Rock

Little Voice

Come Clean

So Yesterday

Anywhere But Here

Metamorphisis

Sweet 16

Where Did I Go Right

Love Just Is

Why Not

The Math

Workin' It Out

Party Up

 All the songs are complete rock, even the slower songs are still pretty rockish, this girl is awesome. There's also bonus features which include the Metamorphisis Tour which covers her tour over a few days. She says bye a few times, but that's just cause it's night-time and they finished the shootings for that day. And then the final goodbye, over 20 minutes long, you can learn lots. Then the Making of the Come Clean video, about 5 minutes. And my favourite, making of Hilary's New Album which comes out September 28th, self-titled. Plus, the Come Clean music video, and another dubbed performance of So Yesterday(live) with different scenes shown throughout, makes it pretty cool just the same. Also with her appearence on the Ryan Seacrest show, about three minutes long. Hilary Hangs Ten, which is just her on the beech, going surfin'. A Photo Gallery from her official site and some sneak peaks at the cinderella story soundtrack and the Lizzie McGuire movie(I guess for those of us who didn't see it, like me).

 Overall, definitely recommended to all Hilary Duff fans, especially when you just want to rock out and have some fun. She rules!!",1094515200,,1868,4.663608562691132
2069893,5,B00029LNVO,"For all the so called critics complaining about the dubbed vocals.  Here's a clue for you, vocals are notoriously difficult to capture live.  Because of this a large majority of live albums have at least some dubbed vocals and dubbed instruments.  This isn't lip syncing as anyone that has seen Miss Duff will tell you.  She sings the heck out of all the songs live. This is done AFTER the fact when the artist goes back in the studio and sings live to replace the existing vocal track.

I took my son to see Hilary a few weeks ago.  I had no idea what to expect.  What I got was a little girl that BLEW almost every rock act on the road this summer off the stage. No dumb dancers or stupid stage shows, just pure kick-it rock and roll(think Pat Benatar circa 1980). Frankly I'm surprised some of the younger members of the audience didn't leave.  This isn't a pop show it's a hard rock show.  Personally I think they could have stuck to the existing live vocals, but someone wanted to clean them up, hence the vocal dub.

If you think she can't rock, go see one of the numerous pop or hip hop acts trying to tour.  Then go see Hilary and hang on to your seat. Hilary rocks with ANYBODY out there.",1093996800,47,1197,4.252212389380531
2069894,1,B00029LNVO,"This DVD is basically like a Milli Vanilli 3000. I dunno about Live. It is just Memorex. Parents, please do not buy this for your kids. It is a ripoff. A money-making machine.",1093824000,3,175,4.333333333333333
2069925,5,B00029LNVO,"this is way better than all access pass. i was a little disapointed that they dubbed her voice, because she really does sing live at her concerts, and i wanted to here her live. but it is a great concert over all, and the hidden features are cool! all the other behind the scenes stuff is great. this is a must for hilary fans",1093737600,,326,4.109375

Probably like most people because of her looks. Then I started to realise.. Hilary Duff just doesn't sing LIVE on any of her performance!

Then found out the So-Called LIVE Concert was released by her.

Once agian, she completely LIPSYNCS the entire Concert.

This is extremely disappointing as this is a DVD that is available to the PUBLIC (worldwide actually) and STILL she as an Artist, cannot EVEN SING live on her VERY OWN Concert where she makes PROFITS out of it!

It's definately a Pathetic effort and I'm so let down by Hilary Duff. I'm even surprised she decided to release SUCH CONCERT as a DVD!!

It would have been reasonable if she was actually doing acrobatical dance moves that didn't allow her to sound good singing live. But all she ever does is walk around the stage.

Also, her songs aren't of Beyonce Or Christina. It doesn't require much skill or talent to sing along to Hilary Duff's songs. Infact, little teens can sing her songs, on tune LIVE. Funny how She can't do this...

From this DVD I made a conclusion that she is NOT a talented PERFORMER nor is she a SINGER.

I would not recommend this DVD as it sounds exactly alike to the CD except with extra noises from her adoring fans who can't tell the difference between live and lipsync.",1093564800,3,1307,4.527659574468085
2069927,1,B00029LNVO,"The audio on this dvd is terrible.  Whoever did the 5.1 mix on it should go work in AM radio or something.  You can't hear her sing!  The band just drownds her out.  Maybe the stereo mode mix will be better...but I've got a nice home theater set-up and I tried about 20 different settings/combos on my receiver and it all sounded like garbage.  Here's a clue - if the DVD is hawking Hillary Duff singing, then mix it so we can hear her!  Worst sounding concert ever, at least the 1st couple songs...that's all I could stomach...",1093564800,4,528,4.336734693877551
2069928,3,B00029LNVO,"First and foremost I'm also a fan of ""Hilary Duff"" but why release a Live concert if all the way she will Lip-sync 13 of her songs. That is really a drag and will also affect her credibility as a singer and take note news spread easily if she is really the real deal. Another thing the mic volume seems so small that the instruments seems to dominate her voice. What are the guys in charge of her up to? If there will be a next time please don't make the same mistake twice !!!",1093132800,4,477,4.031578947368421
2069929,5,B00029LNVO,"This DVD is all about a great singer putting on a great concert. No dancers or special effects because none are needed. Hilary is very talented and does not rely on props or side-kicks to deliver a great performance. If you like her CD, you're going to LOVE this DVD!",1092528000,3,267,4.36
2069930,4,B00029LNVO,"Whether its dubbed or whatever I don't know. I am starting to wonder if ""the girl can rock""? I loved the band though, the sound is great but I was very disoppointed with her lip singing!! I would say to get this DVD but not for Hilary, to hear the band live. It's funny how everytime she talks the lights go out, I wonder if she could be turning her mic on? Why spend so much money on a mic if you don't use it!?! I really hope Hilary will stop thinking if you lip sing you will get to the top like Britteny, Why don't people like REAL singers like Amy Lee of Evanescence!?! I am watching a live concert reight now, yeah thats right I said LIVE she sings, take a hint Hilary! My god t. A.T.u. sings live more and they are from Russia and one of them has a throat problem!!

I was a little disoppointed in this DVD but I knew I couldn't get my hopes up about it because I have never seen her sing live so...

The thing that I don't get is what is so good about this girl. Yeah she can sing but look at this. She lip sings, she doesn't write her own songs, and she has no stage action like she doesn't do anything. Britteny Spears sometimes sings live if she isn't dancing and all Hilary did was jump and shake her head, big deal.

I really hope she makes up for this with her Most Wanted tour or w/e its called. Maybe they will put it on DVD. Don't get me wrong I am a Hilary Duff fan just mad at this DVD whether she was lip singing at the thing or not it doesnt matter doesn't Hilary have a word?

I did give Hilary a big break on this DVD with 4 stars!! The band was really good though. Only took 1 star away for lip singing because she might have really been singing but they might have dubbed it, I don't see why they would though unless they weren't happy with it.

Hilary START SINGING LIVE IT WILL HELP YOU CAREER!!! X-Tena sings live!! Come on Hilary!!",1092355200,5,1860,4.002695417789758
2069931,4,B00029LNVO,"I love Hilary but WHY THE HECK do they have her lip synching on here?  She sings for real in her live concerts so why did they dub her voice for this release?  Plus it is obvious that this ""live concert"" is actually two or three concerts spliced together...I was really disappointed by these facts, but I'm sure they weren't Hilary's fault.  I just don't understand why they would destroy such an awesome DVD by doing these things?  I still give it four stars cuz it's Hilary and the extra features are awesome too :)",1092268800,8,517,4.410526315789474

8024344,1,B00029LNVO,This is god awful and for the plot of her own movie (The Lizzie McGuire movie) to be based apon a fraud lip syncing she should be ashamed of herself..Very hypocritical !!!!,1404950400,,172,4.40625
8024345,1,B00029LNVO,"As good as Hilary Duff's studio work is, it's an absolute shame that she doesn't even sing live. From the second she walks on stage and sings you can clearly hear that she is not making any noise.

Personally, I can not stand people who lip-sync or ""mime"", so you could imagine how dissapointed I was when THIS came out. At some point inmy teenage life, I can't remember whether it was before or after this DVD release, but I went to see Hilary live in the NIA, Birmingham. She was lip-syncing then.

The most annoying thing about this DVD though, is that the footage is extracted from two seperate concerts, which just clearly proves that she is lip-syncing, as we are not even seeing the live performance, just seperate audio and seperate footage.

I strongly do NOT recommend anybody to put themselves through this poor excuse for a ""live"" concert. I don't even think the music is live, let alone the vocals.",1286064000,2,911,4.576687116564417
8024346,1,B00029LNVO,"5.1 OR 2.1 this DVD Concert mix is totally unacceptable.
No amount of EQ from a system will fix it.
The vocals (usually center channel) are terrible.
If it is true that this is a lip synch that alone should warrant
FRAUD.
But even if it is the CD mix, it should sound better.
I have the CD of these same songs and it sounds fine.
I like these songs and like this music.
Just because most of your audience may not have quality sound equipment is no reason to cheat people.",1263945600,,471,4.130434782608695
