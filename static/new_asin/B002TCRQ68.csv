3984367,4,B002TCRQ68,"This is a good way for novice cooks to see how to make the recipes.  They are good recipes, as well.  It's your chance to cook with one of the tv stars.",1273881600,3,152,3.71875
3984368,3,B002TCRQ68,"If you are a fan of Lidia B. ( I always misspell her last name) the NY restaurateur and celebrity chef on PBS, you'll probably want to get this DVD which combines highlights of her series called ""Lidia's Italy"". Each of the televised shows covered a complete meal from appetizer to dessert. Here the producers re-edited it so you get a grouping of appetizer, then entrees and then desserts. You can watch Lidia change her clothes - or even try to match three courses by remembering what she wore! - as you go through the courses. There are brief scenes of regions of Italy as Lidia tells you where a certain dish originated.

Unlike many TV celebrity chefs, Lida is not big on providing details. When she says ""we'll add a little butter"" it can be a half-stick or a half-pound. A ""little olive oil"" can vary a lot. As for cooking times, they are rarely given and the show is not presented in real time. ""Let's put in the oven until cooked"" is a typical comment. (To be fair the DVD does have the recipes as .pdf files to print out but watching her doesn't always show you how to do it.).

Most of the recipes are what Lidia calls ""simple"" but you may not have just two sage leaves lying around. And the baked apples are a bit more complicated because you need to make a cherry sauce as well as a chocolate sauce. (None of her dishes is low in calories or fat; I warn you.)

I did have to laugh as we got to what has to be the simplest recipe here. It's called ""sausage with grapes"". Ready for Lydia's recipe? Here it is:

1. Brown Italian link sausages in a frying pan
2. Add some green grapes and continue cooking
3. Place on a plate and serve

Yep, that's it! For this you need her to demonstrate it?

So, its an entertaining video, but not as useful as it could be. Again, if you know and love Lidia, you'll want this to relive the episodes you remember. I watch her periodically and enjoy her NY restaurants, especially Becco - the pasta one - but I probably won't revisit this DVD very much as I do with Julia Child's classic DVDs.

3984410,1,B002TCRQ68,"I love watching Lydia, except to be honest I am getting soooooo sick of her grandkids showing up all the time, it takes up half the show and all she does is talk to them about what they like to eat.  Nothing against her grandkids, but the last thing I want to see when I'm watching her show is for her grandkids to show up, because then she stops teaching us stuff and just talks to them about stuff.  She can do that on her own time!  I know she loves her grandkids, but personally I don't love them and don't care to see them on the show anymore because they just waste time and I end up changing the channel.  I think it's a bit self indulgent to have them on so often, I mean it would be ok if they came on once a year for like 2 minutes or something but it seems like they show up every other episode.  I do love it when her grandma shows up at the end and takes a bite of what Lydia has prepared, her grandma is so cute...and funny!",1404000000,5,938,3.9157894736842107

3984422,4,B002TCRQ68,"Just watched this video.  It has excellent simple pasta sauce recipes for the beginning cook or inspirations for the more advanced cook.  I plan to use this DVD in a cooking class for middle and high school students.  Lidia is one of the premier Italian restaurateurs in NYC.  Her flagship restaurant is Felidia.  The executive chef, Fortunato Nicotra prepared a dish on this DVD as did the executive chef, William Gallagher from her son's restaurant, Becco,my favorite (affordable) NYC Italian restaurant.  My plan is to show my students the DVD and let them select a few of the recipes to replicate in class.  Then we'll make some pasta from scratch and enjoy a great meal together.  I also intend to buy this for my pasta loving 22 year old son who is quite an adventurous cook. I couldn't access the recipes that were supposed to be downloadable from the DVD.  So I went to Lidia's website instead and found all the recipes there:  [...]. I am looking forward to trying the Basil pistachio pesto as well as the spinach walnut pesto.  She shares a few good tips as well that I intend to try but I don't want to give it all away.",1364601600,10,1131,4.522167487684729

3984433,5,B002TCRQ68,"There are complaints I read about Lidia that she doesn't give specific measurements and I thought that'd be a problem for me, but it wasn't. I followed what she did, and went with my gut on certain things. This is probably not helpful for beginning cooks, but if you have a good hand in the kitchen anyway it's actually really empowering. I've made some of the best dishes ever from using this technique. Her alfredo is truly simple and brilliant, and oh my lord, heavenly. (By the by, I used a cup of butter and 1.5 cups of cream, 2 cups of romano and parmesan).",1322006400,26,563,4.371428571428571
