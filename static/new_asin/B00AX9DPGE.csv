8558794,5,B00AX9DPGE,"New Kids Turbo is the first in a series of film adaptations (the second being New Kids Nitro) of the Dutch comedy series ""New Kids"", which is about the lives of a group of delinquents seeking fun and anarchy in the small village of Maaskantje, North Brabant where the 90's never truly died. The film more or less sticks to this formula with little change. The premise is that all five of the New Kids get fired from their jobs and once their unemployment checks cease due to harassment on their part, they decide not to pay for anything anymore. Inducing complete anarchy in their native Netherlands to the point where the government decides to wipe Maaskantje out with air strikes

It is a very, VERY funny movie that never gets old and the cultural barriers are completely nonexistent",1417564800,,786,4.654676258992806
