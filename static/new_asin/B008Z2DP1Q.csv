8532945,1,B008Z2DP1Q,"Obviously not objectively produced! Look at Chile today and tell me his ideas were a success. I had to turn it off though when it got to the part that made it seem that Allende was the unpopular bad guy and they just added the speedy little blurb, Oh and Pinochet was aided by the United States, which means Murdered by the CIA. It was also the brilliant ""Chicago School"" who orchestrated the economy of the Soviet Union from State owned to Private ownership, and the last estimate I heard was that Putin is worth around $350 Billion, and his friendly multi-billionaire ""Oligarch run Russia like a Mafia and THAT'S the end game of Capitalism. Property Rights over Human Rights = Horsesh#t Story.",1524787200,,695,4.658536585365853
8532946,4,B008Z2DP1Q,The video chronicles the ideas of Friedman and a group of supporters and detractors seek to argue his ideas.  Unfortunately Milton Friedman is no longer here to argue his ideas.,1376784000,,177,4.9
8532947,5,B008Z2DP1Q,"The Friedman theory of economics is so simple and obvious that it should be made available for all US voters, especially during these dangerous economic times.",1358208000,2,159,5.153846153846154
8532948,5,B008Z2DP1Q,"Great ideas and when put into practice they actually work! Keynesian economic practices have failed and failed miserably! Bush jr pumped 750 billion into the economy in oct 08. in Feb of 2009 Obozo pumped an additional 800 or so Billion into the market with another ""stimulus"". Result? unemployment was at 9% for over a year and never lower than 8% until 0ct 2012! Let the free market work it does work!",1350518400,4,403,4.611111111111111
8532949,2,B008Z2DP1Q,"Count the number of lobbyists in Washington - does Friedman's deregulating the market work?

Many economic models work - but you have to follow the money and see just who they work for.

The final result of a Friedman system is a Corporatocracy where the rich stay rich and everyone else works for them. Like what we're ending up with here unless we smarten up soon.

Friedman looks at Hong Kong as a model - really? really? Who in their right mind would want to live in such a polluted overpopulated stinkhole.

How about an economic system with a possitive financial and moral foundation that actually raises the standard of living for the actually human beings who live there.",1350345600,2,679,4.680672268907563
