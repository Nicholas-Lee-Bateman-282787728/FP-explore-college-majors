8731530,1,B014Q67N5I,"It must have seemed like a foolproof idea for MGM to pair Robert Taylor  {# 6 in the 1938 box office polls} and Myrna Loy {Voted the 'Queen of Hollywood"" in the 1938 box office polls} in a comedy with plot elements of prievous  hit films ""It Happened One Night"", ""The Awfull Truth"" and ""Easy Living"" blended together. What could prevent  ""Lucky Night' from being a huge hit ?

Well , just about everything including  a tugid  inane plot, a poorly wriiten  screen play without any humor, charm,  pace or wit with  R.  Taylor and  M. Loy ill at ease with the film's material and  each  other . The tired storyline has Loy playing a millionaires daughter deciding to strike out on her own and find her own way and  ""true love"" not from her social class. She  finds Taylor ""down and out' on a park bench, they fall in love and thru a  series of ridiculous and unfunny episolds they get enough money to marry. They are happy at first but financial and other pressures fracture  the marriage and she goes back to daddy with Taylor now  deciding whether he should try to get her back.

 The director  Norman Taurog  cannot shape the film or decide  {not helped by the screenplay} whether it was supposed to to be either a comedy  or a drama.  Ms. Loy in some scenes appears stunned , baffled and defeated as even this  most accomplished of  comediennes is  stymied by the awfull  screenplay and dialogue.

 I have reviewed over  45 classic films on the Amazon website and this one is plain and simply the worst  one that  I've  reviewed  in  6 years.  The movie even lacks the usual MGM production gloss and with the exception of Marjorie Main and Charles Lane - the supporting cast is ordinary.

 In 1939, Hollywood's greatest year for films, MGM put two of their biggest stars together in what is  {in my opinon} the worst movie either  one of them ever appeared in.  Regretfully with two  of my favorite stars  I give this film one star  - not recommended !!!",1445385600,7,1955,4.4415954415954415

The movie was cute and the story line was very real even for today.",1445299200,3,158,4.129032258064516
