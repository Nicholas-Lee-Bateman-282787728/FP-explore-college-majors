8626910,3,B00GSTHD34,"Well, Ransom S Hester spent 'some' money on this and the cast must have had a good time, but, I just can't figure out whether or not they were serious or were just making a dumb move for us to laugh at.  Watched it all the way through (had to get my 4 buck's worth) but hope it doesn't happen again.  Oh well, like I said; if you want a good laugh, go for it.",1399680000,,359,3.7733333333333334
