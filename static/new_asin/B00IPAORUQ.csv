8644406,5,B00IPAORUQ,"GREAT DVD, picture is clear and because it's been digitally remastered.
It is unlike some DVDs of old movies that the pictures were blurry, grainy and fading and seems to be produced by Desert Island videos and Mr fat-W videos. I now avoid these two productions like I avoiding defects because there are defects.",1471305600,,312,4.796296296296297
8644407,5,B00IPAORUQ,"This is one of those films where there are no good guys...something similar can be found in the most recent film Run All Night (2015).  I appreciate that uniqueness in films that solely feature antagonists/anti-heroes...for real life rarely has any good guys nor heroes in it.  Gang War in Milan (1973) aka Burning City, is definitely in my top ten Poliziotteschi genre films.  Note worthy is the terrific showcase of different characters and the intricate plot...

A must have for all Italian cinema junkies...and if you like the Italian-crime films like myself...this one is a real treat.",1445731200,3,590,5.051546391752577

8644411,5,B00IPAORUQ,"This is another film unknown to Americans previously -- one of ten ""Eurocrime"" movies directed by Lenzi, according to the video introduction by Mike Malloy.  I always watch extras after the fact, and the video introduction by Malloy is very funny and informative.  One other possible ""blooper"" I think I saw (Malloy mentions one) is a guy fires a gun once and fires again -- but it falls on an empty chamber (it clicks).  Anyway Sabato and Leroy are the chief male stars, while Marissa Mell provides a bit of extra star power, but fans of the genre will note one or two other character actors they've seen before.  It's all highly entertaining, and surprisingly not terribly bloody or action-driven.  Raro is really filling the shoes of the now defunct No Shame films, which introduced quite a few relatively obscure Eurocrime dramas to Americans.  The print is perfect, although you might want to keep the volume down a bit due to the raucous jazzy themes that start up from time to time.  Highly recommended.",1403049600,4,1010,4.7701149425287355
8644412,4,B00IPAORUQ,"Raro Video has dipped into the Italian Poliziotteschi coffers and released  Director Umberto Lenzi's first Euro Crime movie 'GANG WAR IN MILAN' aka 'MILANO ROVENTE'- 1973 in DVD and Blu-Ray.  Basically a tug of war of retaliations and counter attacks between a pimp played by actor Antonio Sabato and a drug dealer played by French actor Philippe Leroy vying for turf in Sicily, it emerges as a blistering 100 minute photoplay enhanced by the wonderful photography by Lamberto Caimi and a beautiful music score by Carlo Rusticelli enhanced here by a Dolby Stereo AC3 track.  Along for the ride is gorgeous Marisa Mell who fans remember  from Director Lucio Fulci's 'PERVERSION STORY' aka 'UNA SULL ALTRA'-1969 and as statuesque Eva Kant in the best comic book adaptation to date, Director Mario Bava's 'DANGER: DIABOLIK'-1968.  Although there is no one to side with during the frenetic onslaughts ,Sabato plays his role to the hilt making it one of his best characters besides the bandit Miguel in Director Domenico Paolella's Spaghetti Western 'HATE FOR HATE' aka 'ODIO PER ODIO'- 1967. Released on DVD over a decade ago by Dagored films, the transfer emerged as a grainy,slightly dark window boxed print in Italian with English Subtitles. I viewed the DVD on this release and its breathtaking in a 2.35 HD transfer from 35mm and is available in both English and Italian with English subtitles so you can toss the Dagored release aside.  The only extras are an introduction to the film by Mike Malloy and an illustrated booklet with a filmography on Lenzi included in the slip case.  Lenzi would go on to direct actors Tomas Milian  and Maurizio Merli in his career but its nice to see him come off some Giallo and Spy movies and really showing his skills in this film.  He would gain controversy in 1981 with his ferocious film 'CANNIBAL FEROX' aka 'MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY'. It is also a perfect place to start for fans who want to get into the Euro Crime genre with almost all the showcases (car chases, fist fights, etc.) front and center making for some great entertainment.  All in all, a great purchase for film fans.",1401321600,8,2122,4.804945054945055
