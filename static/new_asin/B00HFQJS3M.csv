8632502,1,B00HFQJS3M,There are so many beautiful operas in the French  repertoire more worthy of revival than this opera by Csar Franck This first representation of the opera is so bad that it would have been better to let it lie in peace. I recommend not to spend your money in this acuatic revival.,1414368000,,279,4.365384615384615
8632503,3,B00HFQJS3M,"First off as an organist I would like to make clear Franck's position in music history.  The average concert-goer probably considers him third-tier at best, with only a few pieces in the orchestral repertoire (Symphony in D Minor, Symphonic Variations), along with a Violin Sonata, and that 'piece de resistance' recorded by every tenor from Caruso to Pavarotti and Bocelli and beyond, Panis Angelicus.

But admittedly, I doubt Franck would even make ""top 40"" if we were going to start rattling off names of composers normally heard in the concert hall.

However ... as an organist, I have to relate the organist's position.  That is, incredible as it may sound, Franck is the No. 2 composer of the universe, second only to the great Johann Sebastian Bach himself!  That is not just one stupid guy's opinion, but a basic tenet of received musical history:  there are two great organ traditions, the North German school which culminated in Bach, and the French Romantic school which was founded by Franck (""Pere Franck"", they called him).

That's right, Franck is almost, very closely almost at the level of J.S. Bach.  Other piddling little composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky ... who wrote nothing, or almost nothing, for organ ... they are not even in the same ball park, not even in the same county.  Nay, not even the same solar system as the two masters, Bach and Franck.

Didja know that?? :)

It's also interesting to note that just about every organist in the world (I mean serious, college-trained organist) can trace his or her ""artistic lineage"" directly back to Cesar Franck through only 4 or 5 generations of teacher-pupil relationships (maybe 6 now for the newest generation).  For example my own ""artistic lineage"", although I am not anyone out of the ordinary, goes thru my beloved first teacher Darwin Wolford, who studied with Alexander Schreiner, who studied with Louis Vierne, who studied with Cesar Franck.  I would like to know how many pianists or violinists have such a direct relationship with their heroic antecedents, Liszt or Joachim etc.

OK now that I have waxed about Franck, let us wax or unwax on this opera and especially unwax on the production.

The opera is a youthful work from ca. 1837, well before the ascendancy of Richard Wagner and Charles Gounod, those major influences on Franck's later career (and five years before Massenet was even born).  If it were truly written by Franck at age 15, that is a major surprise because it is an engaging listening experience.  There's noticeable influence by Berlioz and Donizetti (not of course, of the oom-pah-pah variety, but in the dramatic homophony of some of his overtures).  At the same time, it's umistakeably Franck as it already contains elements of his signature style which one does not hear from any other composer.  I am referring specifically to his habit of taking a short theme or motive and occasionally clinging to it just a little too long, repeating and developing it three or four times in successive bars before moving on to the next idea.  He does this in just about all his compositions, all the way up to his collection 'L'organiste', one of his very last.  Although technically it is a minor point of criticism (and who am I to give advice to Franck??) ... yet I am glad it's there as a point of authentication, as it were :)

And now about the production:  Egads!  I suppose I should be happy for any recording of a Franck opera, youthful or otherwise.  To my knowledge, not one has ever been done before!  This one is mild-to-moderate Eurotrash, not extreme I am thankful to say (I suppose I should be thankful).  The first character seen in this production, that is, the first character presented on stage during the overture, is a stark naked young lady.  And I mean she is nude nude, to the point of, er, oh my!  I tend to think that Franck, conservative even within the context of the Victorian era, would wonder what the heck they had done to his opera.

And I suppose it is common knowledge by now, the stage is flooded.  Most of the action takes place in water at least ankle-deep, in places up to hip-deep.  Other than that the costumes and minimal sets are kinda-sorta period, and maybe a few times I felt the production was not quite so bad and maybe tolerable, maybe ... that is until some fresh inanity were unleashed, such as, for example, the duke would enter with a half-dozen black helium balloons attached by a cord to his collar.  I am ashamed I am not sufficiently inured to high culture to understand what much of this stuff meant.

The singers were fine, I have no complaints about them.  Perhaps the orchestral playing was a little less honed than might be expected, but I am not worried about that.  I would have been happy to just listen to it as a CD, were it not that subtitles are necessary (libretto or English translation being unavailable elsewhere).

Also ... if you just listened to the soundtrack without the picture, you'd probably wonder at the sloshing sound as people move about the stage.  And you might wonder about the sound of rain.  No kidding, it actually rains in the opera.  Here I thought that theaters were originally invented, at least in part, so people could come in out of the rain.  Silly me!",1408924800,4,5268,4.719912472647702
8632504,4,B00HFQJS3M,"Stradella is an unfinished work by C&eacute;sar Franck - better known for his symphonic writing and pieces for the piano and organ - written in 1837 when the composer was just 15 years old and only rediscovered in 1984. The orchestration of the unfinished piece was completed by composer Luc Van Hove, who fills out the sweep of Franck's lush Romanticism to make something more of this otherwise relatively slight work in its first ever staging. Not a major Franck work by any means, but under the musical direction of Paolo Arrivabeni and with an impressive gathering of Belgian opera talent, Stradella is a fascinating addition to the Belgian-French repertoire.

The plot of Stradella is relatively simple and unburdened with anything like psychological motivation or even depth of character. The Duke of Pesaro has ordered his lieutenant Spadoni to abduct the beautiful maiden Leonor in the middle of the Carnival in Venice. Having locked her away in his mansion, the Duke tries to win her love by employing the famous singer Stradella to woo her, unaware that Stradella and Leonor are actually an item. As well as being one mighty coincidence, one would think the Duke might have taken some time to investigate Leonor's love-life, but as I say, such details seem to be of little concern to the young Franck, who instead focuses his attention on exploring the romantic tragedy aspects that this situation gives rise to.

Franck's symphonic scoring would certainly be influenced by Wagner later in life, but here the composer favours the more melodic approach of Gounod - the '&Agrave; demain' duet between Stradella and Leonor early in the first act before the abduction reminiscent of Faust - but it bears a closer relation with the composer's near-contemporary Massenet in this regard. It's a slight work, but the Li&egrave;ge production makes it something more of an event with a spectacular water-based production. Everyone here is kitted out in wetsuits or wearing macs and carrying umbrellas, the singers wading waist deep in water for most of the performance. There may not be much justification for the amount of water that fills the stage (45,000 litres apparently), but it certainly allows for some imaginative visuals, particularly in the brilliantly staged finale with a floating fish which proves to be something of an impressive technical achievement.

The deluge of water and the design of the sets however have something of an absorbing effect or dampening of the sound (in more ways than one!). With huge downpours occurring it can also be more than a little noisy in one or two scenes. Even though they remain semi-submerged for the entire length of the work, the Belgian cast perform as well as can be expected. Soprano Isabelle Kabatu has the necessary range and depth for the role of Leonor, but struggles nonetheless on one or two occasions to rise above the stage noise and the orchestration. There are no such problems for the Belgian lyric tenor Marc Laho however, who lets none of the bizarre stage directions get in the way of a well-delivered performance, his singing clear and resonant with lovely tone, expression and diction. Bass-baritone Werner van Mechelen is a worthy counterpart to Laho's Stradella as the Duke's lieutenant Spadoni.",1392940800,6,3271,5.042513863216266
