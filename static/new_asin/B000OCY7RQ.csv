8184478,4,B000OCY7RQ,"One usually goes into these type of double-(or triple-)feature disks with extremely low expectations. These disks are usually bought in anticipation that the movies will be laughably bad. Sometimes one of the movies will turn out be kinda' good, but if that's the case it's a sure bet that the other features on the disk won't even rise up to so-bad-it's-good standards. That's why this ""Drive-In Double Feature"" from Dark Sky is so unique: BOTH featured movies, while not great by any stretch, are much better than anyone would ever expect.

Little time is wasted putting the Niagra-set SEARCH & DESTROY (1979) in motion. Four Vietnam vets who served together are being targeted by a killer, with one vet killed off during the opening credits and the body of another found shortly thereafter. Remaining vets Perry King and Don Stroud are considered suspects--that is until the killer (Jong Su Park) opens fire on them as they get off a Niagara Falls tour boat. George Kennedy is the police chief who wants to wrap up the case quickly lest the killer scares away tourists. As he explains to King: ""These people prefer to watch violence on TV. Dammit, we don't have time for another war!"" I've read other reviews that have noted ""Search & Destroy"" doesn't have enough narrative to sustain its 90 minute run time, and I agree. There's a lot of padding here, with chase scenes that go on much longer than they should. A better tack might have been to spend a little more time developing King's and Stroud's characters at the beginning before putting them in the killer's sights. Nevertheless, director William Fruet gives us a pretty clear picture of King's and Stroud's hardscrabble existences before the pair become targets. Performances are fine all around (King is especially good here), though the extras in the last act seemed to forget they were supposed to react to the action as no one is at all fazed by King brandishing an assault rifle as he runs down a crowded main street. Tisa Farrow makes little impression as King's girlfriend, but the only reason her part exists at all is to provide the killer with another potential victim.

Though  far cheesier and less focused in its storytelling, THE GLOVE (also 1979) is another pleasant surprise. Ostensibly the about bounty hunter John Saxon's search for a blues guitarist/ex-con (played by Rosie Grier) who is beating prison employees to bloody pulps with a riot glove, the movie spends more time on the trials of Saxon's day-to-day life. In fact, the pursuit of Grier seems to be forgotten for much of the movie as Saxon goes after other bail jumpers and thieves, including an embezzling secretary played by Joan Blondell(!) and a homosexual check bouncer played (for laughs, naturally) by Nicholas Worth. When Saxon isn't trying to get some cash to keep bill collectors (and his ex-wife) at bay, he's losing all his earnings at a rigged poker game or trying to romance Joanna Cassidy. The movie is past the half-way mark before Saxon resumes hunting for the gloved villain. And yet as unfocused as the storytelling is, I found ""The Glove"" to be quite engaging. Often a supporting player, Saxon really shines in the lead role, his performance alone almost reason enough to check this out. Props also go to Grier, his acting much improved over his terrible performance in the terrible (but fun) ""The Thing with Two Heads.""  ""The Glove"" was actor Ross Hagen's directorial debut, and considering he went on to direct such unwatchable dreck as ""Click: The Calendar Girl Killer"" and ""Reel Horror,"" it just might be the best movie he ever directed.

Extras--including ads for 1950s and `60s era snack bars featuring some of the most unappetizing hot dogs and sandwiches ever seen  and ""prevues"" for such movies as ""The One-Armed Executioner,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Last Hunter""--complete the ""Drive-In Experience,"" but that's just icing on the cake. ""Search & Destroy"" and ""The Glove"" provide enough entertainment value on their own.",1381276800,,4003,4.922962962962963
8184479,3,B000OCY7RQ,Cheezee story - Might have been good 40 years ago...  And after investing all this time it has an ending that leaves you empty - Typical of some popular story lines long ago.  I only give it three for those who like older movies,1377907200,,228,4.159090909090909
8184480,4,B000OCY7RQ,"I was pleasantly surprised by this double feature DVD. Particularly with the Glove which is a solid entry in the Private Eye genre. I liked its realism and unromantic presentation of the everyday life of a bounty hunter. John Saxon fits the part perfectly and delivers a solid performance. Joanna Cassidy (who laughs less than usual) is also very good as the bounty hunter's fleeting love interest. I also thought that the avenger with the inhuman riot glove, played by Roosevelt Grier, was an interesting and memorable character as he has a friendly and maybe even chivalrous side. He reminded me a little of Forrest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.",1229040000,5,664,4.833333333333333
8184481,5,B000OCY7RQ,"Although corny and dated, Search and Destroy is one of my all time favorite class B movies.  Perry King and Don Stroud had a stellar performance.

Give it a shot!",1203724800,2,162,4.366666666666666
8184482,4,B000OCY7RQ,"Nice to see S&D finally givn the dvd release. I guess my review would be a bit biased as the part of the Stranded POW helt bent on revenge was played by my childhood Tae Kwon Do instructor Park Jong Soo. I remember a big poster for this movie hanging at the Dojo. Anyhow, worth the price for that movie itself. cheers",1189296000,,317,4.129032258064516
8184483,5,B000OCY7RQ,"What a treat to have both of these films released by Dark Sky, one of the best companies in recent years to deliver rare films that are also remastered to perfection as well as in wide screen where possible.
I've always enjoyed The Glove (1978) it has a memorable opening number and John Saxon is as always excellent in the role of a world weary bounty hunter. Rooevelt Grier also excels and the supporting cast enhances the film.
Search And Destroy likewise makes for an entertaining action feature with good roles for Don Stroud and Perry King ably supported by the ever reliable George Kennedy.
Add these films to your collection and take a trip back in time...",1188345600,3,664,4.635593220338983
