6251297,2,B00I58UN6A,"No issues with the vendor; however, I'm very unhappy to discover that these discs are not compatible with my parents' Sony BlueRay player. What a disappointment for Christmas Day. Product details should include BlueRay player requirements for this UK product.",1451001600,7,259,5.5
6251298,5,B00I58UN6A,one of the best shows iv ever seen,1449705600,,34,3.375
6251299,1,B00I58UN6A,"There isn't a proper warning on this. My understanding is that ""Region Free"" applies to the the Disc. That is to say, it will play in any region, not what it has to be played on. I hope Amazon clears this confusion. Requiring a notice as strong as the ones that are issued with non region 1 or A media would be appropriate. I almost made the mistake of ordering this. That is, until I read the reviews of others who did order them, only to find they wouldn't play on their USA players. After all, in the header, it is the discs that are labeled ""Region Free,"" not that you have to buy a special player to view them. It appears to be a slick way to induce Amazon customers into buying discs that have little or no value in the USA",1448064000,29,729,4.104895104895105

6251308,1,B00I58UN6A,Does not play in US players and there was no warning about this. DON'T buy this boxed set. There is indeed a US version that is out there in Costco and other brick and mortar outlets.,1479081600,3,183,4.111111111111111
6251309,5,B00I58UN6A,"I'm impressed.  Exactly what it is advertised as: a modernization of the Sherlock Holmes stories.  Modern times.  Change of the stories but maintaining the spirit.  Modern technology is integral to some of the stories.  The principle characters retain much from the Doyle stories: banter, relations, and roles.

Casting is tremendous.  Not just Freeman and Cumberbatch ... performers for roles of Lestrade, Mary, Mrs Hudson, and especially Moriarty (Andrew Scott) are ... fun.  Writing is sharp.

There is a relative weak episode that is not in this collection ... The Abominable Bride.

P.S. Please read the other reviews.  This is not a standard format for US, if you are in the US.  Please read those reviews to help judge if you can play these excellent shows on your set up.",1464998400,,779,4.953488372093023
