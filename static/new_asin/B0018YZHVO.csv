3421881,3,B0018YZHVO,"""Minorities,"" such as non-whites, gays, the disabled, and in this case seniors - and the people who care about such minorities - are always encouraged to see a love story that is not between a perfect young white man and a perfect young white woman. And in some cases, our critical judgement is overcome by our heart.

Elsa & Fred, a romantic comedy between a man and a woman near 80 years old, is, unfortunately, a fairly bad movie.

The acting of the two principals, China Zorrilla and Manuel Alexandre, is absolutely wonderful. All else is fair to mediocre. The plot is strewn with scenes that are maudlin or unbelievable. The photography feels like that of a TV movie, and the score is plain awful. The secondary characters are so poorly written that their reactions appear unjustified. Even the set design is unconvincing.

You will hear and read: ""They don't make movies like this in the US."" Not true. It is easy to imagine a cheapie shot-for-shot remake on the Lifetime Channel, with Rue McClanahan and Hal Holbrook. Instead of recreating La Dolce Vita, they would end up on Mt. Rushmore, pretending to be Cary and Eva Marie, but it would be the same insipid and unrealistic fluff.

China Zorrilla - bless her - resorts to Marion Lorne like schtick in parts of Elsa & Fred. If you want to watch China's best, buy or rent Conversaciones con Mama. It has practically the same plot as Elsa & Fred. But THAT's a great movie.",1252108800,5,1428,4.610236220472441

3421883,3,B0018YZHVO,"This is an upbeat Spanish/Argentinian film that is filled with whimsical sentimentality. Not really my cup of tea, but will appeal to those looking for a light romantic comedy (and to those who don't mind subtitles).",1240358400,3,216,5.027777777777778
3421884,5,B0018YZHVO,"What can one say about a film that approaches perfection? Both a love story and a very clever homage to Fellini's La Dolce Vita,director Carnevale allows two seasoned actors from Argentina and Spain, Zorrilla and Alexaindre, to give their best.

3421885,5,B0018YZHVO,"Elsa and Alfredo, 2008 and directed by Marcos Carnevale, takes the viewer on a simple journey of the heart, as two seniors with different personalities and with a varying outlook on life, meet and fall in love.

It has been seven months since Alfredo lost his wife and he is placed into an apartment by his daughter.  Elsa, single and living in the building is an exuburiant, jovial, fun-loving elderly who isn't afraid to take risks.  Clearly a departure from the lifestyle Alfredo shared with his wife, he meets her and casually classifies her as a crazy woman who also fibs.  But it is she who teaches him to live a little, laugh, and enjoy food without worrying about cholesterol or health.  She shares a drem of hers to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome, which is a Fellini movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Dolce-Vita-2-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JKGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Dolce Vita (2-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>.

Filmed in Argentina, director Carnevale has a few films to his credit, as he is well-known for commercials and as a screenwriter of TV series.  The viewer is treated to humor, poignancy, love, and the willingness to adapt for companionship.  The subtitles are easy to read, the story moved along at an even pace, always keeping the viewer attracted as to how the union of two opposite characters will develop.  There is no profanity, nothing to offend, just a tender love story.

I recommend a Czech film about an elderly couple living the opposite, one makes plan for the inevitable death, while the other plans to live before dying.  A wonderful fun movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autumn-Spring/dp/B0000D0YVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autumn Spring</a>.

3421886,5,B0018YZHVO,"Elsa & Fred is a romantic dramedy about a couple in their golden years who meet by ""accident"" -- literally.  Actually it's a ""fender bender"" of sorts.

Fred is recently widowed, and Elsa is --- well, she's Elsa, as you'll find out throughout this charming Spanish-Argentinian film production.  Their chance encounter becomes the centerpiece for a series of delightful events that bring them closer to each other.  As the story plays out, don't be surprised if you find yourself feeling as if you are an ""unseen guest"" to a blossoming relationship that will inspire, amuse, and sadden you.

The cast is superb.  The two leads (Manuel Alexandre & China Zorrilla) seem so natural in their roles, and that heightens the dramatic impact of this endearing story.",1233273600,12,756,4.9603174603174605

In fact, we are going to see it again today at the same theater with friends.

BRILLIANT ~ HEART WARMING ~ INTELLEGENT ~ FEEL GOOD

Very happy it is out on DVD now.
Makes for a great gift to share with older friends to remind them
that life can still be fun and fulfilling after sixty.

If you enjoyed Life Is Beautiful and La Vie En Rose ... this is a no brainer.
The acting is outstanding.

3421889,5,B0018YZHVO,"What a little gem of a movie.  Manuel Alexandre and China Zorrilla are precious in the roles of two elderly people who meet and develop a beautiful relationship purely by accident.  Anyone bored with conventional love stories with young, beautiful people, should see this film.  Yes, it has its melodrama, but it's also very funny and gives hope to us all that there can be love and excitement well into our golden years.  Manuel Alexandre is Alfredo (Fred), a man plagued with illnesses and taking all kinds of pills for ills he really doesn't know if he has whose life is turned upside down by his neighbor, Elsa.  The amazing China Zorrilla (of Uruguay and first lady of Argentinian film and theatre)is the quirky and very funny Elsa, an Argentine living in Madrid right down the hall from Alfredo.  They by chance meet and what follows is pure magic.  How refreshing to see two actors in their 80s give outstanding performances with so many nuances: fear, depression, laughter, etc....

The character of Elsa was too exaggerated to be believable, but I could suspend my disbelief enough to accept her as she was. The plot doesn't bear close scrutiny, but it isn't meant to.

The production was professionally done, with beautiful scenes in Madrid and Rome for a backdrop.

The movie depicts a late-in-life pairing of the unlikeliest of couples: the upstanding, ascetic Alfredo; and the emotional, confabulating Elsa.  The narrative core of the movie revolves around Elsa's little lies coming apart one by one and Alfredo's reaction to them.  The ending reveals one final whopper - see if you can keep a dry eye.

3421982,4,B0018YZHVO,"The performances of the two leads in this love story about a man and a woman in their 70s (well, one may be older) are quite fine. The story itself tries to breathe life and some surprise into a predictable romance, and there are moments when the two septuagenarians actually show the impulsiveness of the teenagers that still live somewhere in their aging bodies. It doesn't take long for Elsa to bring the widowed Fred out of mourning and back to life - and as it turns out, there's not much time to spare.

Like a teenage girl, Elsa talks on her cell-phone while she drives her car - and rear ends another driver. She and Fred treat themselves to an expensive dinner at a high-class restaurant, and then skip out without paying the bill. And before long, there's a chaste sleep-over. Meanwhile, Fred is flushing his meds down the toilet and eating his fill of rich food he's been avoiding for years. A Fellini-inspired dream is realized before it's all over, as Fred's money promised to his son-in-law as a share in a dubious business investment gets spent instead on something else quite self-indulgent. It's a feel-good romantic comedy set in Madrid that lets us believe that Cupid is hard at work for any senior citizens whose hearts have never grown old.",1259798400,,1261,4.654708520179372
