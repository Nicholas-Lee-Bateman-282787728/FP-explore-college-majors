It is quirky, funny and I hope that if you buy it you will enjoy it as much as I have.  If ever I feel slighty down, watching it is quaranteed to cheer me up.",1000080000,8,298,3.625
8017919,5,B0001XLWNU,"Pure genius filming on what must have been a shoestring budget. Plus Bruno Lawrence is in it. That's must see for me.

The same director would go on to make the scifi masterwork, THE QUIET Earth,  as will as the superior of the two Under Siege movies, UNDER SIEGE II: Dark territory.",1520208000,,283,4.423076923076923
8017920,4,B0001XLWNU,"Last year I watched the remake of this called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pork-Pie/dp/B075JZ1JLD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pork Pie</a>&nbsp;and wasn't even aware it was a remake until I watched the special features.  So I was intrigued to watch the original 70's version which has the added word of Goodbye in the title.  The basic skeleton of the plot is the same, a guy hitching a ride with a stranger in a stolen mini from Auckland in New Zealand's northern island, to Invercargill at the bottom of New Zealand's south so he can make up with his girlfriend.  Some scenes are the same or similar in both movies, but there's a lot of differences, so if you've seen one, it's worth watching the other. Both are fun and very entertaining movies, that show you a lot of the New Zealand landscape along the way.

The mini driver in this one is of course a blonde haired small framed guy, in the remake he's Maori.  The guy wanting to get to his girlfriend is older than the character in the remake.  The female passenger in this original is a lot more basic written wise than in the remake and isn't in the film for as long.  I liked the remake version of the girl a lot better, including the fun of the place she works where they originally come across her. This 70's version also is a bi product of the time the movie was made, like a lot of 70's film, she is pretty much just there to sleep with one of the male characters, flirt a lot, but doesn't do much else..  There isn't much substance to her and the actress playing her's acting isn't that great, especially when she first gets in the mini. The remake has a lot more car chases than the original and they last longer, are more spectacular and do more in each one.  This is likely a budget thing, Goodbye has a more budget feel to it than it's remake.  In Goodbye they also start taking apart and selling bits of the mini as their journey goes on, they don't do this in the remake.

As I said both films are well worth checking out.  This one of course is a lot harder to come across.  If you were alive back in the 70's you might get more out of the nostalgia factor, something I who wasn't didn't.  There are some scenes that date the film but at the same time remind you that there was once a simpler (and perhaps for the viewer happier) time. Such as a frustrated John complain's to the security guy at the airport who won't let him yelling at his departing ex girlfriend  follow her into the departure area, ""What do you think I'm going to steal an airplane?""  I personally preferred the remake, but as I said I wasn't alive when this film was made.  The sound quality is of course better in the remake, at times it is difficult to hear what is being said between characters in this original.

I think as a remake the film worked better with not having Blondini wearing a yellow shirt and cap with Pork Pie written on it and a distinctive jacket.  It seemed a bit unrealistic that when out of the car this didn't get Blondini caught.  Also the remake has them accidentally stealing the petrol and becoming fugitives of the law.  In this one Blondini uses the identity from a purse he saw a woman who doesn't react positively to him drop, to rent the mini, being her name is Leslie. They deliberately fill up with no intention of paying a second time, as well as steal from a closed convenience store and other places during their journey. In the remake he steals the mini from some bad guys who were chasing him on foot to kill him.  The John character and what he did to get his girlfriend to break up with him and her family to hate him were more of a mystery slowly revealed throughout the remake, whereas this one you know it all upfront.

As I said though, watch both of these great New Zealand films.  You won't be disappointed.",1515801600,,3844,4.4507845934379455

8017926,5,B0001XLWNU,"In 1981 I arrived back in New Zealand after four years living in London and this was just opening in cinemas the length of the land. At first viewing, I thought it was ok, a piece of low budget film making that was typical to NZ story telling. How wrong was I. It spawned some truly constricted NZ movies such as ""Smash Palace"" ""Heart of the Stag"" and Vincent Ward's first bit of truffle ""Vigil""-the cinematic equivalent of crabs, severe constipation and kissing a dead dogs bum. Harsh, I know but opinion must ride when unbound and I did have to sit through and watch every excruciating camera shot and muffled piece of dialogue. I have not forgiven Mr Ward that. Freedom to walk out? Don't talk rubbish Id paid good brass for my ticket. Anyway the credits did bring some relief. But digressions and pontifications aside back to the main feature. Over time and numerous viewings this is a classic of a film. Not only because the road trip captures a NZ that has almost gone but because it is also very, very funny. It is clown/pantomime at its best. There are so many small cameos which support the main act, the car not Tony Barry and Kelly Johnson, that it hums along very well. Actually both Mr Barry and Mr Johnson (who morphed into a lawyer) deliver good performances. It has minor faults but hey, does that detract. Not at all. What has Geoff Murphy done since that is even a touch on this. For all of you LOTRs fans, this is NZ scenery un-mucked up by special effects and that car..go you little beauty!.",1346198400,4,1512,4.462093862815885
8017927,4,B0001XLWNU,"A very New Zealand film.  Typically understated, low budget, quietly hilarious and with no respect for authority figures.  You will want to own your own yellow mini after this.  The actor who played the scrawny one, Blondini, is incidentally now a small-town lawyer in New Zealand.",1267747200,3,281,5.065217391304348
