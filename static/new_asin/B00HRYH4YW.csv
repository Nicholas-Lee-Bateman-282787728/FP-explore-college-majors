My niece is taking a spanish in college, so I have her watching this one and ""por Ella soy Eva""",1403136000,,158,3.8181818181818183
6201666,3,B00HRYH4YW,"I started watching this when I was visiting my family in Ghana. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish before my return to the US. I recently found it on Amazon and was really excited; so, I bought it. To my disappointment, about 30-40% of the show seemed to have been edited. Part of the story didn't even make sense; because of how much editing they did. About half of the show that I saw at the beginning in Ghana, all have been edited.

If you're looking for the whole story, then don't waste your money...because you'll be as pissed off as I am!!! I bought four other DVD's and I'm hoping they're better....",1403049600,6,611,4.407079646017699
6201667,5,B00HRYH4YW,"Just great product, fast delivery. very good resume of the telenovela. However its a remake of Marimar, it is very enjoyable. I like Ana Brenda Contreras, she makes telenovela unforgettable.",1401062400,,190,5.366666666666666
6201668,5,B00HRYH4YW,"I have given five stars to give this movie a chance to be seen, especially if you are an addicted telenovela fan like me and there are English subtitles!  I know there is some similarity to a telenovela from the 1990s starring Thalia, which I have seen, but I believe there is enough difference and Ana Brenda Contreras was fantastic as the lead.  I recommend this one highly, and, also from now through June Amazon has no new telenovelas listed for sale.  I am going to have romance withdrawal so I am replaying my favorites.  By the way there are many popular telenovela actors in this movie.",1398902400,9,594,4.5233644859813085
6201669,2,B00HRYH4YW,Que decepcion que no surgen ideas nuevas de los escritores.  Muy mala actuacion de los protagonistas y mucho mejor la telenovela de Los Parientes Pobres con Lucero y Ernesto Laguardia.,1398643200,,184,5.133333333333334
6201670,4,B00HRYH4YW,"Estoy ansioso porque llegue la Fecha para Comprar el DVD. No veo la hora de tenerla.
Me Encanta esta Telenovela a pesar de que es un Remake de Marimar. Creo que Ana Brenda es una gran actriz y hizo un exelente papel. Mas alla de las comparaciones con Thalia creo que es digna de ese personaje y que supo hacerlo muy bien tanto en la etapa del pueblo como la del casino.
Soy fan de Thalia pero tambien de Ana Brenda, se reconocer cuando algo esta bien hecho y esta historia tiene todo, buen elenco, buenos actores, hermosas locaciones, nuevos cambios, nuevas historias, nuevos personajes, vale la pena verla.
Ojala el Resumen este bien hecho.
Otra de las cosas que me encanto de esta Telenovela fueron las Actuaciones Antagonicas de Elizabeth Alvarez y de Rocio Banquells, exelentes actrices, hicieron muy buen papel.
Comprenla, no se van a arrepentir!!!
Review/Comentario: Me Gusto Mucho el DVD pero la verdad es que esperaba mucho m&aacute;s de la Edici&oacute;n.
En el DVD hay partes que pasan muy rapido y se pierden muchos detalles como por ejemplo al principio cuando aparece Esther la prima de Lucia y cuando Octavio se despide de Maricruz antes de irse a la Capital, pero sobretodo lo del incendio del jacal.
Faltan muchisimas partes importantes de la Historia, la Escena en que Maricruz se venga de Lucia esta pero se pierde toda la parte previa despues que ella va a visitarla al Casino y le muestra los pagares hasta ese d&iacute;a, quitaron todo lo que pasa antes y despues. Cuando hecha a Lucia, a Ofelia y a Octavio de la hacienda esta pero le falta una parte, la parte en que Maricruz les ofrece un pedazo de tierra para construir un jacal porque no tienen a donde ir y Lucia se rie, en eso Maricruz ironicamente le dice, ""como el que tu mandaste a quemar"", en el Resumen Lucia le contesta que no tiene pruebas. Falta esa parte...
Lo peor es que el Final de Lucia no esta completo, en el DVD solo se ve unos segundos cuando se esta prendiendo fuego despues que tiene el accidente y en la siguiente Escena Miguel ya esta en el pueblo para pedirle ayuda a Octavio y a Simona, quitaron las escenas en que Miguel se entera del accidente y Lucia esta en el hospital quemada, tambien la parte de cuando Lucia le confieza a Miguel que ella mando a quemar el jacal de Don Ramiro, donde no se arrepiente y muere.
No esta la Escena en que Jos&eacute; Antonio le cuenta a Maricruz que ya sabe porque Miguel esta de vuelta en el pueblo y le dice que Lucia murio en un accidente igual que su abuelo y Maricruz le dice al abuelo que su muerte ya fue cobrada, ojo por ojo, diente por diente, en eso Jos&eacute; Antonio le dice a Maricruz que ya puede terminar con su venganza y ella le dice que no, que todavia le falta vengarse de Octavio, sobretodo ahora que se va a casar con Simona.
Son partes muy importantes que no tendrian que haber quitado.
Algunas de las Escenas que tampoco estan y que me hubiera gustado mucho volver son por ejemplo cuando Maria Alejandra/Maricruz  le muestra a Lucia que Miguel esta tomando con Raiza como ella le hizo quedar en ridiculo en la hacienda haciendola pelear con la mujer que estaba bailando con Octavio, cuando Lucia desafia a Dios, y lo que mas me quede con ganas de ver fueron las peleas de Maria Alejandra con Carola por el Casino, sobretodo uno de los primeros enfrentamientos que tienen cuando Carola ingenuamente le sugiere que se consiga un poder para representar a Alejandro y las peleas que tiene con Doris por Octavio y el Gobernador pero sobretodo la parte en que Doris intenta matar a Maria Alejandra con una pistola y Maria Alejandra forzejea con ella, se la quita y le pide a seguridad que la hechen del Casino.
Y algo que note es que quitaron todo lo relacionado con el Emir Karim/Carlos de La Mota, omitieron su personaje, no se sabe lo que pasa con Carola Canseco, no esta la Actuacion de Teobaldo/Manuel Landeta, no se ve el Final de Jos&eacute; Antonio y omitieron la relacion de Eduardo y Aracely y tambien de Solita y El Perico.
Hay personajes que entran y salen de la Historia asi como si nada, se notan cortes bruscos y sobre los delirios, locura y maldades de Simona no dejaron absolutamente nada.
Sin ser esos detalles el DVD esta bien editado solo que para los que ya vimos la Telenovela nos hubiera gustado que tuviera esas Escenas tan importantes que queriamos volver a ver.
La verdad me quede con ganas de ver mas, decepcionado por la cantidad de Escenas buenas que le quitaron.
El DVD Contiene 4 Discos, tiene una Duraci&oacute;n de 15 Horas y 8 Minutos, trae la Primera Entrada, la Salida Final y la M&uacute;sica Original tal cual se transmitio en Televisi&oacute;n y la Calidad de Video Es Widescreen (HD) como las Ultimas Telenovelas que ya han lanzado en este Nuevo Formato.",1392336000,7,4750,4.555555555555555

6201789,5,B00HRYH4YW,"In short, Corazn Indomable could be described as a typical melodrama Mexicano, but after watching 50 episodes in a row, I can tell you that this story can teach you a couple of life lessons, too. Although the whole story has 162 episodes, 50 are enough for you to see how the story develops itself, and possibly how its going to end (or at least, how you expect it to end).

In the first 50 episodes you will see how the too-naive-to-be-truth Maricruz* falls in love with Octavio, and then has her heart broken into pieces by him and his family. After the tragedy in her family as describes the plot, Maricruz  leaves to the capital city with her sister Solita and starts working as a maid at Alejandro's house, who happens to be her father, without any of them knowing about the bond between them. Maricruz gains his trust and love, and he helps her to get educated and become a high society woman.

With her beautiful heart and fearless soul Maricruz gains not only Alejandros trust and love but ours. She got us rooting for her as she seeks for justice to her grandfather, who was actually murdered by Lcia.

At this point we are so amazed by Maricruz smartness and what she overcame, that we don't realize that she became the villain of this story. Her earlier desire for justice became an insatiable thirst for revenge, and in order to get revenge on those who made her suffer, she leaves so many important values and relationships behind, she gets blinded by hate and what comes next is a vicious cycle of revenges.

So, what lessons have I learned from this story?

6201866,5,B00HRYH4YW,"Corazon indomable (Savage Heart - 909 minutes) What a great. great showcase for Ana Brenda Contreras! In the first disc her Maricruz is pure country mouse, never wears shoes, has no manners (eats with her fingers) and reacts straight from the heart. She wipes her nose and swipes the snot on her hip. She is open, ingenuous and totally unsuspecting of others. She has been raised in a shack by her paternal grandfather who has her birth certificate, but refuses to show it to her.

This one has all the plot lines we love:
* 1) Meet cute with Octavio (Daniel Arenas) the handsome, rich co-owner of the rancho
* 2) Fall instantly in love and get married (He wants his share of the rancho, this is the best way)
* 3) Doubts creep in...AFTER marriage...
* 4) Inlaws derail the relationship so she bails
* 5) Lost in the big city
* 6) She meets ""real"" father but doesn't know it
* 7) He loves this unknown young woman but she makes him think of his long-lost daughter
* 8) He becomes Pygmalion/Professor Higgins to her Galatea/Eliza Doolittle, teaches her table manners, etiquette, fashion, deportment and business courses
* 9) She picks up the reins of his companies and starts kicking butt and taking names
* 10) At the casino, her father comes to fix things but unbeknownst to him, his real daughter has already stepped in and run an audit
* 11) Her lover is soooo confused ...., but always loves her.
Memorable moments: When that awful Lucia (Elizabeth lvarez) makes her pick up the heirloom necklace from the mud with her teeth we hope she will never, ever be so humiliated again! NO punishment would be bad enough! But then again, Maricruz does a pretty good job of revenge. Also I loved it when that rascally artist is murdered, Octavio thinks Maricruz did it, so he quickly confesses. When she hears of his confession, she immediately turns herself in, insisting that SHE did the deed! The police are very confused...

There are so many subplots I can't begin to address them. These are 909 rich minutes well-spent, only wasted when someone dies; then expect excessive hysterics for awhile. You have characters and plots you will enjoy, with lots of humor and sweet lovemaking. (The two leads are particularly effective.)

I saw this DVD from the city library, then immediately ordered my own private copy from Amazon.",1407110400,6,2322,4.67237163814181

8635202,3,B00HRYH4YW,It a little boring.,1499904000,,19,4.0
8635203,5,B00HRYH4YW,"My mom and I watched some of this Telenovela (soap opera) on TV, but once I bought and received this 4 discs' telenovela, I was soo incredibly disappointed to see that a lot, and I mean A LOT of scenes are edited out. Even one of my favorite scenes!  Televisa should sell this telenovela complete!

I was surprised to watch this telenovela because I didn't know that Maricruz (Ana Brenda Contreras) was going to be so revengeful most of this show. When my Mom and I watched this on TV, I saw her attitude and was attracted by her strong will and a fighter in life doing just, but after watching this on DVDs, I was slightly disappointed to see her get revenge. Ignoring that though, she later realizes that when she becomes stubborn and childish in her own ridiculous decisions, she causes harm to those around her. I love it when she realizes that and changes to good. I rather focus though to have her image of a fighter with a strong will to do just. :)

Since these 4 DVDS are heavily edited, people who watch this for the first time will be confused at flashbacks and explanations since they aren't shown in these dvds. Oh, and the description of the telenovela about Maricruz meeting a man who takes her in as a daughter is actually in the novela, her real father who was searching for her before he died.

Okay, now to explain why I rated this telenovela a 5 star is simply because, even with these flaws I mentioned above, I love this novela so much. Maricruz is gorgeous and I love to see her tough and do good.

Sorry if this review sounds weird, I'm kinda distracted, LOL!

EDITED: I forgot to add that sometimes the English subtitles are not correctly translating some words the characters are saying.",1481587200,2,1713,4.456869009584665
