8142852,5,B000I0QLFU,"Very very very cute, but the price is higher than the first and second one.  This frustrates me with any anime that does not offer a complete collection of the series because you get one volume and decide you really like it and then you have to pay more and more and more to finish it.... which has led to me NOT finishing it.  But if you have the cash, and you like really cutesy stuff, go for it.",1362182400,,398,4.025316455696203

8142855,5,B000I0QLFU,the layout of the story is really good i really like the show and give it a full blown 5 starts. it is a really nice story. and i love the graphics as well. as soon as  i saw the first episode i new i had to get the entire show even though it wasmn;t completely finished so if you want to see the last episodes you have to order it from japan and resd the subs. but other than that it is a superb show.,1260057600,,402,3.6744186046511627
