2542442,5,B000EWBKDU,"I bought this DVD prior to traveling to the Amazon Basin - mainly to the Rio Negro. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it before my trip. It helped me to better understand what to expect, what I might see, etc. I enjoyed it even more afterwards, as I found myself watching it again and again after returning home. It is very accurate and real. It portray's what you will really see on the Rio Negro and what the Amazon region is really like. It highlights things perfectly. I only wish it was longer or there was another one. I loved it!",1170892800,7,532,4.33
2542443,1,B000EWBKDU,"After buying and loving Blue planet, life in the undergrowth, life of mammals and life of birds, I wanted to try sothing different.  So i searched for a DOCUMENTARY on the Amazon river.  After being shown this DVD by the search engine, I took a chance and bought it.  Little did I know that this DVD is extremely religious and trys to trick you into believing in intelligent design.  Not only that, this DVD and its ""creators"" are extremely misleading from the begining, never being upfront about tryingto sway you from believing in evolution.  Not only that the video comes with a thick catalog of other ""informative"" DVDs on intelligent design, so as to confuse you even more.

This DVD belongs in the religion section.",1158796800,17,721,4.728
2542444,4,B000EWBKDU,"This is a very nice & I think must have cd to my animal collection. It is fish jumping out of the water catching spiders hanging form trees, it has of course the ever scary & feared pirranah's. I love it becasue it is done in a very professional manner. The only bad thing I have to say is it leaves me wanting more or maybe that is a good thing you decide. I really wish it was like three hours long but you cant have everything you want or can you?",1154476800,8,450,3.902173913043478

8115065,5,B000EWBKDU,"An excellent program about the Rio Negro River, it's water wildlife and the lives and economy of the families that live on it. For those looking for ABC's World of Discovery - Secrets of the Amazon, this is the exact same program... it's just been repackaged and has a new narrator. I miss Michael York's voice as narrator of the original version, but Grant Goodeve does a good job. This DVD will be of particular interest to freshwater aquarists, as many of the fish species highlighted are popular in that trade (Cardinal Tetras, Angel Fish, Hatchetfish, Arowana, various catfish, Piranha, Pipa Toads, etc).",1415404800,2,609,4.922330097087379

8115067,4,B000EWBKDU,"Somewhat geared for the younger crowd. I enjoyed the film and good photograpy in the film. Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",1363737600,,131,4.5
8115068,5,B000EWBKDU,"This documentary was very good, cool story and excellent shots of fish and other animals in their natural habitats. Check it out!",1359676800,,129,4.909090909090909
8115069,5,B000EWBKDU,"Our family loves videos that explore the animal kingdom, and this documentary was no exception. The photography was amazing and so vivid that it felt as though we were standing on the banks of the Amazon River. Two of the many interesting animals featured were the macaw and the Pipa toad. The Pipa toad was particularly fascinating because the mother toad keeps the eggs (up to 100) safely on her back until they hatch. We are not just told this, but shown.

Hosted by Grant Goodeve, not only was this a story about the Amazon River and the animals and plantlife that call this area their home, but it was also about a family who resided in a small village on the Amazon.  It was fascinating to see how a resident of this village worked so hard to provide for his family (which included 10 children of varying ages). He caught fish and sold them to a buyer, who would in turn sell the fish to pet stores in other countries, including the U.S. This man also taught one of his sons where in the sand to search for, and how to collect, turtle eggs for food.  I loved how this dad taught his children the ways of survival that had been passed on to him from past generations. While it's not explicitly stated in the movie, I also loved how the fascinating animals are just another example and excellent reminder of our highly-imaginative Creator.

There are several other movies in the Explore the Wildlife Kingdom Series, and I'm hoping the rest of them are as well-written and produced as this one.  I highly recommend this documentary to families with children over the age of 7. (The very young may be frightened by a few of the animals including the coral snake, and some of the life and death accounts).

""Explore the Wildlife Kingdom - Golden River: Secrets of the Amazon"" is an interesting and educational journey you won't want to miss! I have added this movie to my mom-approved movie listing on my blog.

8115070,5,B000EWBKDU,"Loves the directing views and angles they shot the whole flim. A real enjoyment. Only cons: too shot of a flim. If one day have one that intro freshwater fishes about other parts of Africa -eg: cichlids, will rush out to get hold of a copy. Two thumbs up",1269388800,5,254,4.204081632653061
8115071,1,B000EWBKDU,"I really dislike religious creationism in a scientific wrapping. When people try to remove scientific facts because of their religious belief, I find it a very serious matter. All people are welcome to express their religious beliefs, but when proven facts are denied just because of a persons religion, this is very serious for science and society. How is science thought to be possible when religious ideas are replacing proven facts?

The creationists are making movies just to spread their words. Ok, but then I will have the right to oppose these people! Modern genetics show the origin and relations between species, and is very hard to put aside. I will be carefull to keep away from creationist propaganda like this in the future.",1256774400,3,738,4.951612903225806
8115072,3,B000EWBKDU,"This isn't what you think it might be, the cover leads you to believe that piranha play a major role, I believe they mentioned them for about two minutes. The rest was on the life of the people who live on the Amazon, that's no secret. Once you've seen the National Geographic documentaries it's hard to settle for this level of mediocrity. Pass on this one, its generic and not worth the money you'll pay, new or used.",1208304000,6,419,4.384615384615385
8115073,5,B000EWBKDU,"I watched this DVD prior to traveling along the Rio Negro. It is very informative.

Since I have returned from the trip, I have watched this DVD again and again. It

reminds me of so much that we saw/experienced. I would absolutely recommend it to

anyone who is planing to travel along the Rio Negro or who is just interested

in learning more about this area of the Amazon region.",1171065600,6,382,4.414285714285715
