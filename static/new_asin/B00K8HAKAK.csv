6408691,5,B00K8HAKAK,"I live in the UK and started watching this at episode 8 on TV, really funny and light hearted comedy sad they cancelled the show after only 1 series but hey its well worth watching the episodes they did make.

Purchased from Amazon USA as its not available here in the UK",1403913600,,271,4.211538461538462
6408692,5,B00K8HAKAK,"As I watched The New Normal again on DVD, I was thinking, I would love to know people like this.  I like Seinfeld, but for better or worse, Seinfeld and shows like it, changed the format of sit-coms to stories about basically unlikable people.  Look at the top shows, The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, Two and Half Men, etc. Yes, these shows are funny, but would you really want to be friends with these people?  Despite the awards, The New Normal struggled to find its audience.  Here is show about positive people, growth, individuality, and our evolving society, which was funny, emotionally touching, never heavy handed, and often leaves the viewer with something to think about.  Some of the best sitcoms of all time such as MASH, Cheers, and All In Family etc. took time to find their audience. Its too bad The New Normal did not get that chance.  It was nice to see sit-com about the magic of human connection that left you feeling good about life.",1403568000,18,957,4.6
6408693,4,B00K8HAKAK,I had watched this series when it had aired on NBC. It was a really good show that had a lot of promise for a run longer than 1 season. It presented more than one viewpoint on modern families. Great cast.,1403222400,7,204,4.0
6408694,1,B00K8HAKAK,god i hated this show... i thought maybe it would be funny but was just insanely annoying! The little girl makes me never want to have children and the grandmother is horrid! other then that its pretty boring and is more drama then comedy or anything else. I gave it a good chance and watched a few episodes but anymore and i would have shot myself!,1403136000,,349,4.303030303030303
6408695,3,B00K8HAKAK,"I was so excited when this was put on DVD; however, the packaging is less than stellar. The outer DVD sleeve looks like it was printed with a printer that is running out of ink and pixelated. The design on the DVDs themselves also looked of poor quality. However its still worth it for the great show. Also disappointed there was absolutely no extra features.",1402099200,18,359,4.538461538461538
6408696,5,B00K8HAKAK,"I really, really liked this series. Did I tell you I enjoyed every episode. Well acted. Ellen Barkin as a bigot from Ohio.",1462579200,,122,4.3478260869565215

6408701,5,B00K8HAKAK,"ABC, CBS or Fox should have picked this show up after NBC stupidly dropped it it was a really good show to watch!",1446940800,2,113,3.9565217391304346

6408704,1,B00K8HAKAK,What a horrible show! Just more liberal ideology shoved on america. No wonder this crap got canceled. Most shows with this type of content rarely make it past two seasons.  Avoid this garbage at all costs.,1435363200,,205,4.694444444444445
6408705,4,B00K8HAKAK,"I loved this series, and while I'm sad that it didn't see an official HQ release, I'm still glad that I get to own it. The only issue I had with this set was that the final two episode didn't work on my copy.",1430870400,2,208,3.75

6408708,5,B00K8HAKAK,"This 3-disc set has to be the greatest entertainment value EVER.  After viewing disc 1, I was so captivated and wanting more that I watched all three discs in one sitting...and still wanted more.  This was one incredible series that should definitely still be in production.  The writing was fresh and clever; the direction was flawless; the characters were extremely well-developed; and the acting was superb.  There were so many scenes that were laugh-out-loud hilarious, and others that were tears-inducing poignant.  The scene where Shania presents her class project is not to be missed, and the same goes for the proposal, the confessional, and the birth scenes...and Ellen Barkin dressed as Endora for Halloween was sheer genius!  All of the actors on this show gave awesome performances, but I've got to say that NeNe Leakes has such talent for drawing you in, and Andrew Rannells' comedic timing is nothing short of perfection.  I can't remember when I got so much entertainment and complete enjoyment from one $25 purchase.  I probably should buy another copy as I'm sure to wear this one out...",1425859200,6,1104,5.027472527472527

6408710,5,B00K8HAKAK,Amazingly written! This show definitely deserves a 2nd and a third season. Why can't tv shows like this make it anymore? We are sick of reality tv and real housewives. Please don't cancel a ire brilliant shows like this or GCB...,1422057600,,229,4.609756097560975
6408711,5,B00K8HAKAK,"A consistently clever and laugh-out-loud look into the lives of a gay couple, the surrogate mother for their soon-to-be-born baby, and the families of each. The acting is believable, the characters relatable. Nene Leakes is a standout in her sassy role, as is Ellen Barkin in her spot-on portrayal of an over-the-top conservative who is determined throughout most of the series to get everyone to live life according to her rules. Bebe Wood is also especially notable for her keen awareness of the nuances of a child being raised by a single parent. I've rarely seen such a genuine approach in ""sitcom kids."" If only this series had been given another season so that we could see how the raising of the baby would have unfolded. But I'm thankful to have a DVD set of this one-of-a-kind show.",1421712000,3,791,4.739130434782608

6408717,5,B00K8HAKAK,"Great show. Great recording. There may not be any extras, but who needs them? The show was clever, funny, and heartwarming, and has an unbelievably great cast. I've waited a long time for this, and I'm happy it's finally available. By the way, the audio and video quality are especially fine! The only little carp I have is that the Halloween episode is presented here in the same order it was shown on TV, and comes at an odd place. The Halloween episode was originally scheduled before the Thanksgiving episode but severe weather problems caused its delay until another time which turned out to be much later in the season.",1408233600,8,625,4.6909090909090905
6408718,5,B00K8HAKAK,"The show was so beautifully done. It was insightful, realistic, heartwarming, and funny. I loved the portrayal of love despite the gender the love was between. It makes me sick to my stomach that in 2013, ignorant people are still making a big deal about having same-sex couples as a main character on TV shows. There was nothing graphic or disgusting about the show. It was an intimate portrayal of a real family just trying to do the best they could. This could've blossomed into a ground breaking series that would've pushed boundaries and opened up minds. It's unfortunate that America is so ignorant. If you never watched the show, I highly recommend it. It's pure genius!",1407628800,15,677,4.794871794871795
6408719,5,B00K8HAKAK,Happy I finally have it,1406937600,2,23,3.8
6408720,4,B00K8HAKAK,"I actually liked this show. It's a shame that the reality shows are what captures the attention of America today. Much like Outsourced, this show was not given the proper time to spread its wings. First seasons are always diffiicult. That being said, each character brings an element to the story that was entertaining. It was clean, a little camp, and did have many different messages about acceptance and compassion.

Was it better than the Cosby Show or Golden Girls? Maybe not, but it certainly deserved better than one season.

I did purchase this, and Outsourced, to remind me of shows that were good, but were not given their due.

I recommend buying this little gem.
