8040941,4,B0006A9IR0,"""BATTLES & VICTORIES"" is a fine compilation of material from many sources. The discs are programmed to simulate what a theatergoer might experience from 1942 to '45. Thus, newsreels of battle footage and war-themed cartoons accompany the movies.

""The True Glory"" and ""Fighting Lady"" both won Oscars for Best Documentary. ""Prelude to War"" shows the errors made at WWI's close that led to an even larger conflagration 20 years later. The six fine documentaries on disc #3 cover famous battles and warcraft. Besides superlative contemporary documentaries, there's two variety movies. ""Hollywood Cavalcade"" was made just prior to the war and features such famous entertainers as Buster Keaton and Al Jolson, and ""Stage Door Canteen"" is even MORE  star-studded! Also, ""Strictly G.I."" is a film of a ""Command Performance"" radio show.

ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, content details appear on box's back cover and most DVDs include bonus items.

8040942,1,B0006A9IR0,"Well it's amazing what you can dress up as a value for money WWII documentary package so lets call this what it is.

""WWII Battles and victories"" distributed by St Claire Vision is a three DVD 8 ""documentary"" set comprising a mixture of 1940's vintage US Government propaganda and assorted Hollywood

""information"" films ranging in length from 133mins to 17 mins. Portions of these films have been sold separately as the ""Why we fight"" series"" (perhaps by a different distributor?).

If you are thinking that ""Battles and Victories"" refers to any kind of analysis or documenting of significant military or historical events during WWII think again.

For the most part each of the documentaries is a ""day in the life of"" recounting of some WWII event such as Midway with an overlayed propaganda narrative, dubiously accurate archival battle footage and very ,very little in the way of fact.

There are even corny overdubs of combat footage with a Hollywood actor issuing orders to soldiers etc. The dubs are not even lipsynced.

The film quality and production values are what you would expect for 60 year old films but make no mistake- if you are thinking this series is akin to say World at War, History Channel WWII Documentaries or some of the technical docus on tanks and planes of WWII- forget it.

My guess is the producers bundled together some old archival newsreel and other footage they got for peanuts from the studios, threw it onto DVD, put it in the documentary section of Amazon and other distributors alongside real, retrospective, technically detailed and historically informative productions, gave it a title that sounded like the other proper docus of the genre and hoped nobody would notice.

Unless you want archival 1940's propaganda footage for your next college assignement then don't bother with this dubious production.

Laughing all the way to the bank.",1144540800,4,1880,5.0
