8358562,4,B0029YFJJM,"I live in New York, just a stone's throw away from St. John the Divine Cathedral so it was insane of me to miss this particular concert but I didn't really become a 'concert person' until the year 2000. Be that as it may... I saw this concert on PBS and later purchased an official VHS copy eBay because it was not available on amazon back then. Nana gives a wonderful concert and her beautiful voice combined with her uncanny ability to sing in multiple languages make for a truly wonderful performance. I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 because 1. Her voice and diction show certain imperfections which are not apparent on her studio recordings. 2. She messed up on the lyrics to a couple of the songs. 3. She came across as somewhat nervous which is strange because I've seen her in 3 subsequent concerts and she exuded pure confidence all 3 times. Perhaps she was a bit nervous because she was singing in front of the Greek Orthodox equivalent of the Roman Catholic Pope. Excellent selection of songs 4 repertoire!",1433030400,,1022,4.52972972972973
8358563,5,B0029YFJJM,"This concert was performed October 25, 1997 in the magnificent Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York City.  Nana sings a wide variety of beautiful songs in English, French, Greek, Latin and Spanish.  Nana's daughter Helene stands next to her and serves as a background singer.  Nana Mouskouri has been involved in the promotion of peace, love and hope for many years, and she was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador after the death of Audrey Hepburn.  At the conclusion of the concert the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew who is the global leader of the Orthodox Christian Church presents Nana with an award for her humanitarian efforts.  The Patriarch also delivers a brief sermon about the difficulty of attaining true peace in a violent world.",1305504000,,758,5.032
8358564,5,B0029YFJJM,"Wonderful souvenir from a special concert given by our lovely Greek singer in New York, inside a church. Excellent production. The concert was performed as a wish for all the mankind: The peace. During the concert, Nana Mouskouri sings in Latin, English, French and Spanish. Don't miss it if you are a very true fan of Nana Mouskouri because we can see her at one of her most beautiful performances, with her unique voice. It would be so good to have this product in a new release, I mean, in a DVD.",1265500800,3,499,4.434782608695652
