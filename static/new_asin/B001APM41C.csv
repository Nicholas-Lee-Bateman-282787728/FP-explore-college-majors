3456822,5,B001APM41C,"This is the Only TX Chainsaw Massacre you must own on BR

I think I've owned every Disc Version of  The Original TX Chainsaw Massacre (Every LaserDisc & DVD)

This BR is Simply ""Perfect""
Darksky Films took there Must Own 2 Disc SteelBook Ultimate Edition of Chainsaw carried over everything to The HD Format
Crafted this Ultimate BR Edition
It's a Shame that it wasn't Heavily promoted
'Cause it's such a Major accomplishment in the HD Technology.
That's the number one problem with Great Horror Film. They don't get No Respect being anything but, Horror Films
When there are Director's Like Romero, Fulci, Carpenter, Barker, Coscarelli, Argento, and Hooper who make works of Art!

The Film itself is The 1st True Modern Horror Film
That Introduced The New Slasher Genre to the world (Years later Halloween, FT13, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Hellraiser would join Leatherface as Iconic Boogie men!)
You can easily  Debate that it's the Best Independent Film Ever Made!
The Look, makes it something Very Unique!  raw and frightening
It's A Classic for so many reasons

A must own  BR 10/10

UPDATE 10-3-2014 My Thoughts on the 40 Anniversary Collector's Edition
Is the just released 40th Ann. worth Double dipping without a doubt yes (There are 3different 40th Ann. BR Versions  a single BR Version fully loaded (w/2 New Commentary Tracks!) a 4Disc Edition (w/2 BR & 2dvd's) and a super expensive Limited BR that comes in a 18 wheeler (some funky Named Version) I'd recommend the first two Not the later (Since the Limited Edition Version is very expensive for what you get)
The new 40th Ann. BR is a must have for all  Horror Fans! you get 2 New Commentary Tracks
4K Scan & 7.1 Audio (Plus all the extras from the previous BR)
Gonna try and add a youtube video on here  (If it doesn't allow me to add this clip it's called  B.Jr's Horrific Halloween 2014: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 40th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Overview) Very interesting that made me decide to keep the previous BR!

I've got to say that this film has had the same effect on me today as it would have if I were to have seen it years ago on the big screen.

This film [for me] was highly enjoyable - it did not seem to be the cheesy horror flick I was hoping it would not be. This film truly is a masterpiece of horror, which holds up very well to the test of time. It's absolutely captivating and it has far exceeded my expectations.

Presentation-wise, this Blu-ray release looks incredible. Audio options include the original mono track, a 2.0 lossless, and 5.1 DTS. There are a few interesting bonus features as well.

I had no idea that in some places this film was banned until not too long ago. It is in a class of its own. I'm both shocked and astonished...crazy, mad stuff here!

The transfer of this film to the new Blu-ray format is great, considering this movie is now over 30 years old.  Also, the extras and the 5.1 mix make it a worthy release.  There is some grain to the picture, especially during the evening scenes, but overall, the print looks great.  Tobe Hooper liberally uses tracking dolly shots in this offering, and it becomes tedious after a while, but it really sets the mood--as if the camera is another character in the piece.  As a fan of more mainstream horror, it took me a while to warm up to this picture, but this edition is a prized addition to my collection.",1235001600,,717,4.484615384615385

3456828,5,B001APM41C,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre tripped me out when I first rented it on VHS a few years ago. It was around 2001 and I rented it because I was like 13 and Bored! So me and friends watched it late at night, and everyone disliked it, cause they were idiots. I loved it! The film is so bizzare. Its just this old movie with a group of friends discovering an obandoned farmhouse near one of the girl's grandparents' old house. In the farmhouse lives a strange, sadistic murderer and his entire family! It's so creepy and trippy cause you don't see it coming, especially when you don't really know anything about the series whatsoever. It was really scary and strange and artistic. I really enjoyed it. It's filmmaking at it's finest. Easily one of the greatest indie films I have ever seen and the best horror film bar none!",1225756800,2,816,4.483221476510067

3456830,4,B001APM41C,"Review of the Blu-Ray edition (4 stars out of 5)

The Good Things
*Includes a number of special features; documentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, and trailers.
*The movie is one of the freakiest ever made.  It has some graphicness to it, but is not quite as bad as I thought it would be (newer movies like ""Saw"" are way worse).  It achieves terror more through the creepy settings and unsettling ideas.
*Filming style is good.  Has a lot of good camera angles and movements.
*Production design (for a low-budget movie) is good.  The house they go to is the freakiest thing ever.  Costumes are great.  Make-up effects are great.
*Sound design is great.
*The story is simple, and straightforward.
*Characters are good and very well-acted.  Writing is not bad.

The Bad Things
*Special features are in standard definition.
*Even though the blood and gore is limited, it is disturbing enough to scare some people away.  Not reccomended to those who are easy to scare.

The Questionable Things
*The video quality on this disc is rather grainy and fuzzy.  It has some cleaness, sharpness, and color to it, but its not the best.  Still, the grain accentuates the film very well, and can be considered a good thing.
*Sound quality is okay.

This is truly one of the scariest films I've ever seen.  Its creepy, unsettling, and intense.  A definite precursor to modern films like ""Saw,"" but without being overly graphic.  This way, I see it as being very classy.  Combined with a good cast of characters and a simple plot, its very effective.  Everybody who can handle it ought to watch it at least once, for it is quite scary.",1223596800,6,1618,4.734767025089606
3456831,3,B001APM41C,They added extra footage that makes the movie drag on. There's a reason they took it out. I wish it was the same as the theatrical release.,1404172800,,139,4.185185185185185
3456832,5,B001APM41C,"Everything about this copy is as good as it gets. Sure, there could've been a second disc ... with a steelbook box  ... and a 40-page color insert book, but that would be asking for a lot of a movie that nobody expected to be a grounbreaking classic of indie horror.

Everything you need is really already inside and the HD conversion is superb, if you're in to it looking cleaned up. Personally after watching this and My Bloody Valentine in HD, I almost wish I could just watch them in their original format. Something about the old 35mm look (even in SD) has that look to it that just makes it better. But the cleaned up HD looks nice too.",1401667200,,642,4.297520661157025

Now a lot of the actor's who played in it have died. It was made in 1973 and can't be beat by any horror today. Especially 40 years later so this film still scares the crap out of me everytime i watch it so if you never saw this classic film don't watch it alone and in a dark room. And once you see it you'll be addicted to the film so if you. Can get the blu ray versions.,1395187200,,514,3.858490566037736

TCM is one of the most realistic and brutal horror films ever made. To me there is no comparison when it comes to true shock and awe in horror motion pictures. This film has had one other American transfer that helped the picture astoundlingly and the audio too. But, not until now does this 4k transfer finally let the viewer see the film like its the first time ever viewed. The audio sounds amazing when decoded with a DTS amp. And the picture has an amazing color to it, like the daytime scenes taking on an amber hue and the night time scenes take on a nightmarish blue cast to it. The picture in my opinion is perfect. This one is a must own for fans of this film or fans of horror films period. When I first saw this film when I was about 12 years old it stained my soul and gave me nightmares from that point on. Still to this day I have nightmares every now and then about old Leatherface chasing me through the woods with saw a buzzing (and I am 34 years old).

3456841,4,B001APM41C,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre almost single-handedly reinvented horror with this powerful film. Based on a true story about serial killer Ed Gein. It is one of at least three horror film franchises loosely based on Gein (along with Psycho and Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal). Five friends visiting their grandpa's old house are hunted down and terrorized by a chainsaw wielding killer (Leatherface) and his family of grave-robbing cannibals. I always loved the dinner scene and wondered if Grandfather was alive or not. I watched this dozens of times on VHS with my little TV and couldn't see a thing for long stretches while Sally was screaming the entire time. It had tremendous power then but looks much better on Blu-ray. There is over 3 hours of bonus content in this release.

Special Features:
Exclusive featurette with actress Terri McMinn entitled ""off the Hook""
Commentaries from Tobe Hooper, cinematographer Daniel Pearl, actors Gunnar Hansen, Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Allen Danzinger, and art director Robert A. Burns

[Review for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Collection: 2 Stars]
You get Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 5 & 6 in this double feature. The fifth film is the remake which is quite good but can't hold a candle to the original Texas. The Beginning is average. This is the only TCM collection available on DVD or Blu-ray and it could have been much better. We get the R-rated versions not the uncut releases. There are 7 films in the franchise but the original is head and shoulders the best of them. The remake was better than expected but it's not going to achieve the legendary status of the original. In the TCM remake, five friends help a traumatized young hitchhiker before being stalked and hunted by a deformed chainsaw-wielding killer (Leatherface) and his family of equally psychopathic killers. In TCM: The Beginning, a group of friends are on one last road trip before they're sent to serve in Vietnam. Two brothers and their girlfriends get into an accident that calls their local sheriff to the scene. A terrifying experience begins where the teens are taken to a secluded house of horrors where the Saw family reside.",1377302400,2,2395,4.99749373433584

Whole human bones and fragments
Nine masks of human skin
Bowls made from human skulls

3456849,5,B001APM41C,"In 1973-74 Tobe Hooper Crafted a Bare Bones.. Minimalistic Horror Film That Had No Gimmicks.. Not Even A Score To Speak Of.. And In Doing So.. Made What Is Arguably One Of The Top 3 Horror Movie Classics EVER! A Pioneer In The Horror Movie Genre! So many Current Horrow Films Owe So Much To This Classic.
And It Also Introduced to The Psychotic Family. There Would Be No House Of a 1000 Corpses With Out This Movie. Leatherface Is One Scary Villain-- But The Crazy That Exists During The Dinner Scene Is As Unsettling As Any Chase Or Kill In The Rest Of The Movie. In Fact It Can Be Hard To Watch!
This Movie Has A Reputation.. And It Earned It.. And Even After Watching The Slicker.. Bloodier Films That Followed..This REMAINS A Must See For Any One Wanting Sheer TERROR!!
Th Almost Grainy Documentary Feel Of This Movie Plays So Well. The Cast Of Normal, Non-Stars Also Led To Realism.
But Its The Style In Which Hooper Directs This That Is The Best!
Often There Is No Set Up.. Its Just One Creepy Or Violent Act That Is Triggered For No Reason.
The Hitch hiker Losing It And Cutting Our Victim In  The Wheel Chair.  The Nonchalant Way The Family Tortures Marilyn. This Is Day To Day Routine For These Psychos.. And Because Of That.. It Is Scarier.
Even Leather face's Entrance.. Door Opens.. Swing A Hammer And Another Victim On The Floor... So Matter OF Fact.. So Every day. So Effective. Here Lets Impale You.
Leatherface Is Just Going About What He Does.. No Grand Standing.. No One Liners.. Not Even Creative Killings.  Brutal Business Like Killings. Torture Done Because Its Needed For The Final Product!..
Strictly Business Like... I Find This To Be The Over-All Feel Of This Movie.  There Is No Real Excess...It Is Just A Documentary Like Look At What Happens To 5 Teenagers..  This Almost Threadbare Feel Makes Every Whir Of The Chainsaw.. Every Missed Hit On The Head. Each Impaling On A Meat Hook That Much Worse...
And Leatherface Dancing At The End Of The Movie With His Chainsaw In Some Bizarre Rage Is One Of The Scariest Scenes In Any Movie!",1370908800,2,2059,4.539083557951482
3456850,3,B001APM41C,"This was movie was an interesting experience for me as it was quite different from other horror movies I have seen. It acts more realistic, has more then one bad guy, was somewhat disturbing and is host to a different type of villain in classic horror movies. I say different in that, the bad guys are actually just ordinairy people. But as The Dark Knight proved sometimes a ""normal"" person can be far more scary/deadly then most villains.

I'll admit I was spooked for a good portion of the movie and certain scenes really made me wince for either the characters or myself almost feeling as if I was suffering along with the characters. What I mean is, several times when the characters encounted scary situations or were harmed I felt like it was almost happening to myself also, such as when one person gets impailed by a meat hook.

I won't reveal more of what I liked as I feel that may ruin the movie. However I do feel as if I need to explain why I rate this 3 stars when it seems like I am giving the film a 4 star review.

Well, the main reason for that is, I didn't like the protagonists in this movie. I felt most of their behavior and interactions were pretty stupid and this cast couldn't work together to save their lives. Also how a couple of them went out, it just felt stupid. I was actually more glad rather then going ""OHH man I would hate to go out like that.""

And also one of the bad guys towards the end, does an action that makes me go ""Why aren't you doing this? This goes against stuff you said/did during the movie.""

Still it was an interesting watch and I'm glad to have seen it.",1369440000,,1609,4.262295081967213

I do know that this franchise started a long list of controversy. It is also the first to have a demented psycho killer wear a mask.

The film was originally shot using 16 mm reversal film stock. This restoration, for the first time, gets down deep into every beautiful grain of the film for your ( and my ) viewing pleasure. The color saturation has been beautifully restored as well.

I was curious to see if one particular frame of film that apparently was severely damaged along the way would appear in this version as it has appeared in every video version I have seen. It does not. It has been repaired.

Congratulations on an excellent job of restoration!",1356220800,2,730,4.6

3456873,5,B001APM41C,"This film is such a land mark in the horror genre; it single handedly created the slasher genre. Tobe Hooper created the concept of taking a handful of teenagers and facing them off against a larger than life antagonist whose sole purpose is their demise. But the film is not just blood and gore, there is also a strong psychological aspect of the film that plays with your head. Tobe Hooper takes the concept of family values and perverts them. The Sawyer clan is adjusted to the idea of cannabalism as a way of life, that it seems almost like a virtue to them. They are a traditional loving family with perverse anti-values that disrupts the minds of the movie viewer. The plot of this film would be duplicated in later films, such as ""House of a 1000 Corpses."" This film is a must have for any horror collector. Tobe Hooper would duplicate his success with ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2,"" yet all other sequels afterwards would fall short, simply because no other director had the ability to create characters as rich and compelling as what Tobe Hooper. With that said ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre (2004)"" was a worthy remake. My advice to you is purchase ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2,"" and ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre (2004).",1342483200,2,1249,4.656108597285068

It was 1974 and I was only just 15 years old,my friend asked me if I wanted to go see a movie in Boston and that his father was going to take us,and I said yes let me ask my Mother and she said okay,it was the evening showing. I then said to my friend what's the name of the movie?he said ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""and I said whats that?he said I don't know but I want to see it,I remember my thinking was that it was going to be some sort of Documentary. So we arrive I get my popcorn and drink we sit in our seats and the movie starts. Already the opening music is making me uneasy along with the images of the corpses,so as the story goes along I start thinking someting is going to happen to this group,as soon as Kirk arrives in the house and Leather face hits him with the hammer I slouched in my seat and had never seen anything like that before,my friend sitting beside me looked at me and said ""are you alright""and I remember clearly saying to him these exact words""WHAT IS THIS""I felt like walking out of the Theatre right there and then,but the part that really made me squirm was the meat hook scene,remember I'm just 15 years old and the scariest thing I had viewed up till then was the original ""Frankenstein with Karloff""I managed to sit through the entire movie closing my eyes a few times with no escape,It stayed with me for a few weeks and took a while to get over it,that's how much of an impact it had on me. Of course now I own the movie and when I view it,it just bring's me back to that eventful day. To me it is the scariest Horror movie of all time.",1335830400,5,1630,4.065217391304348

The blu-ray is just a copy of the dvd that came out a few years ago, but I was fine with that since I did not own the dvd. The movie was awesome and still scary just as i remembered it since i last saw it when i was a teen. To my great excitement came sadness when  I wanted to see the special features and they did not work!!!!! I cliked on them over and over and nothing, it just brought me back to the main screen again and again.

3456876,5,B001APM41C,"The first time I watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was back in 1975 the old fashion way: at the movie theatre with the huge screen. I was 13 years old. At that time I had already seen ""The Exorcist"" a few times, and in my young opinion the best scary movie of all time; however, I didn't really get frighten watching The Exorcist, so when I heard TCM was one of the ""scariest movies of all time"" I said no way; if The Exorcist didn't scare me, then most likely no other movie will. I was terribly wrong.
 The first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but shortly when the first victim is walking down the hallway in the house and stands in front of that creepy wall, and the wall slides open, and this creature appears with a sledgehammer, it was time to cover my eyes with both of my hands, and that's how I watched the rest of the movie; between the fingers of my hands. Fine, I'll admit it, till this date, I still watch this movie the same way; between my fingers.
By the way, if you liked this movie, I highly recommend a 1975 foreign film called ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie."" It was released in the U.S. as ""Don't Open the Window."" This is the best zombie movie of all time.",1322352000,,1185,4.17467248908297

3456878,5,B001APM41C,"Summer.  1998.  The small electronics section of the local department store was relatively quiet on this night.  The tube televisions on display were emanating  just enough white noise to be heard but not enough to distract customers.  He stood before the undersized display of VHS movies.  He was alone, something he didn't seem to mind as much anymore, scanning the shelves for something old and new at the same time.  Horror films hadn't been allowed in his household growing up, but freedom had come in the form of a driver's license a few years prior.  Not only could he come and go as he pleased, he could purchase the films he, at one time, could only listen to his classmates describe.  It was a right of passage that was long overdue.

The small collection of cardboard slipcases stared back at him as he scanned the shelves with his eyes.  A title in large, red block letters on the bottom shelf caught his attention.  It was a title he recognized.  The cover of the package depicted a large man wearing a butcher's apron and what appeared to be a mask of human flesh.  He grips a chainsaw in his hand while a young woman screams in the background; hanging from a meat hook attached to a crude support stand assembled from railroad ties.  It was grotesque.  It was macabre.  It was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

He vaguely remembered the title from his childhood through a screwball comedy called ""Summer School"".  In the movie, two teenage, class clowns make numerous references to the title even going as far as having a classroom viewing of the film on the projection screen.  It was a film reference not really understood at the time by the young mind, but one that was certainly remembered.  As if the memory had been stored away in the furthest corners of his mind like old photo albums in an attic, just waiting to be rediscovered.  He purchased the movie, left the store and drove away.

On to the evaluation phase of this review:  Seeing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time was, at best, confusing for me.  After my initial discovery adventure of the film (as told above) I was hopeful this movie could be compared to John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween"" in terms of quality and genuinely frightening storyline.  At the time I was really into creepy, atmospheric themes in horror films, whereas the settings would become sort of a character itself in the film.  Say for example the Danvers State Mental Hospital in Brad Anderson's film ""Session 9"", which is also another one of my favorites.

We (my friends and I) watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, for the first time, in the front room of an apartment.  I didn't like it.  Quite frankly I thought the film was far too confusing, not so much in terms of what's going on but how it attempts to narrate itself.  Scenes are jumbled with camera cuts, close-ups, blurs, darkness, film grain and dissonance.  I didn't understand how, at the time, twenty four years of hype had been attached to this film.  As the closing credits rolled on the screen I (the overly opinionated, self-righteous, teenage film critic I was) openly told my friends the movie failed.  I wasn't captivated at all by the befuddling mess we just watched.  Specifically letting them know I was completely unimpressed with the film's lack of subtleness.  That's when one of my friends said something that made me reanalyze the whole film.  ""That's the whole point, it's supposed to be a nightmare.""

A nightmare.  Suddenly it all sort of clicked.  The sporadic cuts, the fuzzy out-of-focus moments, the tight shots, the extreme noise, the abrupt ending; it was a nightmare.  It was like coming so close to death. it vomits on you.  My initial perspective of this overlooked masterpiece was altered by a single, casual sentence.  Thanks Duke, wherever you are.

Re-watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre throughout the years has become almost nostalgic for me.  I've watched as the film has progressed from one superior media format to the next.  When I found it, it was a mere full screen copy on VHS.  When it found its way to DVD I was right there to pick up the first copy on the shelf.  Today we have Blu-Ray.  What is it we find so fascinating about picture clarity?  For me it's seeing a film that, statistically, should have failed miserably and vanished into obscurity survive and evolve.  VHS to DVD, DVD to Special Edition DVD, Special Edition DVD to Blu-Ray.  Who could have though a film shot on grainy 16mm film back in the early 70's could not only survive but manage to adapt to the times?  A rhetorical question that can easily be answered with a literal answer; we did, that's who.

The Blu-Ray disc itself is as good as it gets (at least for now).  Picture quality is on par but don't expect to see Pirates Of The Caribbean 4 HD clarity here.  The content itself mirrors the same extras as the Special Edition DVD that was released two years prior with one major Blu-Ray exclusive added; a short, ten minute segment entitled, ""Off The Hook with Teri McMinn"".  The  former 'Texas Chainsaw' recluse Teri McMinn comes out of hiding for a rare interview.  She discusses in detail how her big death scene was accomplished, plus working with Tobe Hooper and the rest of the cast and filmmakers. A nice little bonus.

No matter how or when you found The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and added it your compendium of horror films, this Blu-Ray edition is an a commemorative necessity thirty six years in the making.  A grainy, 16mm film that has aged for decades but has somehow become more unblemished with time. A grotesque nightmare that has survived, evolved and found it`s way into the hearts of fans everywhere.  The only difference now; that nightmare is in high definition.",1292284800,6,5732,4.699497487437186
3456879,3,B001APM41C,"""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", the 1974 original by Tobe Hooper, is one of my absolute favorite films. It has a certain atmosphere and visual style/cinematographic brilliance that in my opinion is only matched in the horror field by John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"", and Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"". It's an absolute treat to the senses (visually, aurally) for those fascinated by the macabre.

The best way to see the film (besides watching a film print) is to watch the UK Seriously Ultimate Edition Blu-ray (BD) released by Second Sight. I'm unsure if it is region-free, but it does play on Region A players, and can be ordered from Amazon's UK site. Note, however, that there are standard definition extras that are in the PAL format, which won't play unless your TV handles it. (Most HDTVs sold in the US do not, a most frustrating restriction imposed by the manufacturers and perhaps by movie and TV show distributors as well.)

I own and have watched both versions, and the reason I say the UK BD is better than the US BD released by Dark Sky Films is simple: detail. Both are sourced from the same restoration and HD master handled/supervised by Synapse Films' Don May, Jr.; however, the US release suffers from serious digital noise reduction. There is little grain to speak of, and the removal of grain results in a very soft, murky appearance. It's not an altogether dreadful presentation, but does not do the film's 16mm roots justice.

The UK BD shows quite a lot of rough film grain, and the rest of the details in the image are intact as well. Mind you, it IS a rather soft film, and shot on 16mm in the early to mid '70s, so don't expect super refined detail--but there is a lot there to be seen that which is handled properly with the UK disc and not so much the US one.

Light is handled properly with the UK disc as well. Whether the source be the sun or a lightbulb, light looks very natural and radiant on this release, giving off a natural glow, whereas on the US disc it looks flat and dull. Regarding light and dark contrast, the UK disc also looks sufficiently dark when needed (shaded areas, night scenes, and shadows), and appropriately bright during daytime scenes and indoors, while the US release is a little weak in this regard.

There is an issue of difference in coloring. The color timing on the UK disc I find overall to be much deeper and warmer. The reds are generally a bit more orange-red than on the US disc, but I find the reds and all other colors more accurate to a low-budget 16mm film shot in 1973 (it was filmed during the summer of that year). You can see full resolution screencap comparisons between the two releases, as well as between the US and Austrian BDs, at Caps-a-Holic. Note that the Austrian release looks very similar to the US release, but has more detail and is brighter. I'd like to buy this one eventually, but it is of course expensive to import, is a limited edition, and is Region B-locked. (Eventually I intend on getting a Region B Blu-ray player to take advantage of the great Region B-locked BDs released in the UK and other parts of Europe, but not for some time.) Regardless, based on the screencaps, I find the UK release to be far more visually pleasing than the Austrian one and is likely more accurate to the film and HD sources. The Austrian release appears too bright with not as rich of contrast as the UK release, and detail seems more present on the UK release as well.

So, if you want my recommendation, I say skip the US Dark Sky Blu-ray of this film, and get the UK Second Sight Blu-ray instead (you can order it from Amazon.co.uk). It's a far greater visual presentation than what's available here; and again, it WILL play on a Region A Blu-ray player. Just bear in mind that all of the extras are in standard definition PAL format, so they won't do you any good unless your TV and BD player are capable of handling the video signal. The UK BD is truly a treat, and contains original mono, 2.0 PCM lossless, and 5.1 DTS audio tracks. Highly recommended for fans of this horror film masterpiece and for true high definition enthusiasts.

As for the US release, I give it three stars. It's not an awful transfer, and all the extras are of course playable in the US. However, since seeing the UK release, I never intend on watching the US one again in regard to the main feature.",1280620800,12,4388,4.511949685534591
