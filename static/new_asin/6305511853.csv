This has to be one of the best stories ever! If it were a picturless novel it would sell!",1011744000,2,302,4.224137931034483
7890902,4,6305511853,"This is the second OVA series - First one was called Galaxy Fraulein Yuna.
Ayako has come to play. However, she plays a little rough and puts most of Yuna's team in the hospital. Yuna tries to make friends with Ayako. I'm not going to reveal whether she succeeds or not, but Ayako also has two sisters who decide to make an appearance. They want to defeat Yuna and Earth.
The members of Yuna's team get more screen time in this one. Just like the previous one, this is not a show to take too seriously. It's just fun. However, this one is a bit darker than the first.
Overall, I think the voice acting is good, but I don't think it works for the singing. The music was written for Japanese lyrics, not English. The songs just don't flow as well. There are only two songs in English - opening scene and at the very end. The only decent dubbed song I've heard recently is the opening theme to Rayearth (first season), but compared to the original Japanese version, it's not perfect either. The Yuna songs here don't dominate the show, but I just wanted to point this out. The dubbing for the last song works better than the concert at the beginning.
I do like the opening song ""Lightning Heart!"" which is not as upbeat as the theme to the previous OVA. For me, the song is saying we're responsible for our own futures. ""Let's Go Out"" is the closing song and is perfect with Yuri singing it. The song is about going out to eat. On the final part, they go back to using ""Good Night, Moon Shadow"" which you get to hear in both English and Japanese here. The dubbed version leads into the closing credits where you hear the Japanese version.
As usual for ADV, the opening and closing themes remain in Japanese. Typically, ADV gives the translation on the first episode and the phonetic Japanese pronunciation on the second. When there's a third episode (as with this tape), there are no subtitles for the opening song. There are English subtitles on the closing theme here because they change songs.",998956800,2,1993,4.463013698630137
7890903,5,6305511853,"This Anime is all in what an Anime fan needs- a plot. Some Anime's I have seen have a plot that is either confusing, or leaves you with a meatball on your head. This anime is understandable abd replaces that meatball with action! But, in order to understand this Anime you have to find out about the first series and what occured. The tape has 3 episodes (each 30 minutes long, longer than most anime tapes :P), and is suitable for children over 12. The Dubbing in this is wonderful! It's just as good as the Subtitled! ADV did a wonderful job on forming this! But beware-the girls are loud and gaspy. It's got mecha parts in it as well, which that's what makes it really cool! It stars a girl named Yuna who is always trying to make friends. Well, I can spoil it for you until you buy it. I would recommend this anime to girls... sorry guys... but anyone can try tatoring the feeling of becomming a Galaxy Fraulein it's gotta be a viewer!",994464000,4,939,4.3107344632768365
