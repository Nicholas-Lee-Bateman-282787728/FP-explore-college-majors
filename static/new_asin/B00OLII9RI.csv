6755819,5,B00OLII9RI,"I have seen the second season first on japanese Blu-Ray and so I had to buy the first season, too.
Railgun has a strong cast and it is nice to see them interact with each other.
There is always enough action with some criminals and crazy scientist but also calm times where they just enjoy school life.
It isn't a too emotional series but it does have it moments.

But funimations subtitles... sissy for Onee-chan? Really?!
Season 1 doesnt have the BluRay sharpness like the the 2nd season.
But even so, this series gets 5 stars here.",1422489600,,534,4.505154639175258

6755821,5,B00OLII9RI,"I was a little hesitant with starting the ""Index"" franchise. The whole shebang totals over 90 episodes and 1 movie. Despite this, I can happily say that the ride is definitely worth its length. I suggest immediately watching all of ""Railgun"" as soon as you are done with the 1st season of ""Index,"" and then go to season 2 of ""Index."" End with the movie. This procedure will give you all of the episodes in chronological order. Let me tell you, Mikoto is one of the most likable female characters in a long time. In no way stereotypical as most tsundere types (you probably won't even notice she IS one), our Railgun makes for a multi-dimensional, relatable lead. Her friends are quite enjoyable, too, and their all-around camaraderie is something you really get behind and believe in. The side characters are sympathetic, and carry the main cast efficiently enough (I especially enjoy Touma and Index's cameos). The music is very similar to ""Index"": the techno beats accompanied with the occasional rock track. The openings were memorable, and fit Mikoto's disposition perfectly. What can I say about the animation? Fresh style, expertly drawn backgrounds, cute characters, and EXCEPTIONAL action scenes, the animation is nothing to dismiss. I especially love Mikoto's lightning strikes; those are a treat to watch themselves. The plot is very episodic, a few episodes lent to discovering misfits and delinquents with curious ester powers. However, the poltergeist arc with the giant swollen mutant and the droopy-eyed doctor is FANTASTIC and deliciously dark. It's a good turn of the series' relatively upbeat shoujo note. Railgun doesn't get too deep into philosophical values, but it doesn't need to. This is a story about the relationships of characters and their plights in a city where every action decides the next step of fate. I had fun, and I would be unappreciative to demand anything more. I felt like it was a four star show, but awarded it with five because the production team behind this but their all into making sure that the characters weren't cutouts and the stories weren't cliched. It doesn't just show; it glows. I recommend the 1st season of ""Certain Scientific Railgun"" for anyone who likes intense supernatural action, cute character relationships, and pristine animation; take my word as you see fit.",1421798400,19,2327,5.046753246753247

6755823,4,B00OLII9RI,"First off the show is 5 stars. The dock in score has nothing to do with the show itself. I really hate to give less then 5 stars to shows/movies I enjoy.

I have no idea what is going on with amazon lately but 3 of my last 5 DVD/blu ray cases have been damaged. Not to the point I want to return it or anything but nevertheless its getting old now. This was a pre order too, something I was really looking forward to.

I may just have to think about dropping prime and do my best to not pick ""amazon fulfilment services"".",1421712000,4,521,4.0
6755824,5,B00OLII9RI,"Set in Academy City, A Certain Scientific Railgun follows the story of Misaka. She is one of the few Level 5 Espers making her one of the strongest in a city of 23 million people. This series follows Misaka and her companions as they get caught up in the craziness that is your average day in one of the most advanced cities in the entire world. As a companion to A Certain Magical Index, it manages to tell it's own stories and have it's own characters. Much like Saten who doesn't doesn't even show up in a the Magical Index series. (Which sucks, cause she's my favorite.) All in all it's a great show that can stand on it's own, but given the expansive world created by a Magical Index it's nice to be able to have more of what you already love. If you haven't seen A Certain Magical Index, I would strongly recommend you check that out to as some characters do overlap as they play key roles in both series and it's also a great show! A Certain Scientific Railgun is a fun show and it can deliver feels as well as make you laugh. Just don't call Misaka Zapper.... she's not a fan and YOU don't have the Imagine Breaker.

Highly Recommended!",1421020800,3,1144,4.296296296296297

The city is packed with esper students, gangs, mad scientist, and monsters.  Misaka teams up with her flirty friend and roommate, Kuroko (a teleportation skills user), her fellow agent Uiharu, and their friend Saten (a spunky Level 0 esper) to take on danger whenever and wherever it arises. Follow the girls as they find excitement, action, adventure, and no small part of comedy.  If you enjoyed A Certain Magical Index, you will enjoy this installment.

Also, surprisingly, I liked the side characters more than the main character the most. Specifically Uiharu and Satan. I loved their characters and how the story always included them, making them a major part of it really, and I love the emotion they displayed throughout the series.

6755842,5,B00OLII9RI,"A spin-off of a Certain Magical Index, Railgun takes place a little before and during the first season of Index. I've really enjoyed the whole series overall and love the setting of Academy City, a city with wind-energy turbines and blimps that project the news and weather is just really neat. The fact that it's populated by hundreds of labs and schools full of people with super-powers makes it an interesting and exciting city.

Honestly, I think that Railgun is probably my favorite of the Index series. Misaka is a great protagonist, who often finds creative ways to use her powers to solve problems. The rest of the supporting cast is all excellent, with mostly completely new Railgun series-only characters but enough interesting crossover with Index to be fun. The cameo's of Kamijou from Index are always really amusing while also affording Kamijou as seen from Misaka's point of view an air of mystery.

Really fun series, despite being a spin-off you could actually watch it before Index, although you might not appreciate the cameos and cross-over as much. Get this series, you won't regret it!",1434240000,3,1107,4.946236559139785

6755850,2,B00OLII9RI,"I love the series and think it to be great, the two star rating is solely because when I received it in the mail the case was damaged. There seems to be a problem with Amazon being able to ship DVD's, Blu-Ray's, or video games without damaging the cases because this has gone from a repeated occurrence to a common one. To their credit I have never received a disk that was damaged but it doesn't change the fact that I shouldn't have to have a damaged case and it shouldn't be a bad enough of a problem that I am more surprised to not receive something without it being damaged.",1425600000,,579,4.225225225225225

8684115,4,B00OLII9RI,"This is probably the best time to jump in the certian magical index series with season 3 of a certian magical index is coming soon. Thanks to prime day I picked up all 5 blu ray + dvd combos of the entire index series so far (it was either that or star trek). Starting with the side series that takes place before index (at least for the first season) is a certain scientific railgun. Season 2 of railgun takes place almost at the same time of index but ultimately it's still a side series so chronology speaking it doesn't matter. Sure after a year later the copies that they have in the amazon warehouse is a bit scruffed up but they are still fresh.

This is a pretty hefty series.... Each season of a certian scientific railgun and a certain magical index totals 24 episodes per season, totaling for about 96 episodes in total (for now until season 3) and the index movie. Then again I seen 100+ episode animes before, like yu yu hakusho. A 700+ episode series like naruto or one piece doesn't really exist in any other anime in this current generation so anything that totals in about 100+ episodes for a series is pretty impressive. With that said lets get on to the review.

12 episodes in so far (halfway) and I have to say I'm not really that impressed... The story is kind of bland, a bit too much lesbian comedy going on for my taste espeshally when they are underaged girls don't sexualise little girls....
So far the only thing the story has going for it is the action, it's quite ""electric"" so to speak. The animation really holds up well, the anime is from 2012 I believe but it's not that outdated... At least not like bleach which is obvious that they had to stick to a 4:3 screen ratio because the anime wasn't really made for large tv's back then.
So of course this anime is in full screen, 6 years isn't that old for an anime.
The fact that people talk about it like its soo old is pretty ridiculous in my opinion....

Anyways as I said the story itself doesn't have much going for it, for an all girls anime so far it's a bit boring and going into the relm of spice of life at most times, keeping the sweet epic action to only a bare minimum.... There is no real danger to the main characters so far in the series at the moment... The idea is intresting enough though, a city were 80% of the population are students who are studying about esper powers. I heard another review that esper powers are poorly explained in this series as well as in index... But it does explain that these powers are not natural and are the result of scientific experiments, hence the whole ""level upper"" ark so to speak explains it pretty well.

 Misaka is a level 5 esper and so far one one the strongest espers in the series so far, with her friend kuroko who is in the group called judgement she goes around and putting a stop to crime with her teleportation and fighting skills. It just seem like there is really no overall clear ending to see for this series and more like one piece were they just have an endless amount of random adventures that never seem to actualy stop. At least for this railgun series, seeing as this was only a side series to the actual main series of index which I haven't watched yet. The main character from the index series does occasionally show up a FEW episodes for a couple of minutes and has some sort of conflict with misaka although all he wants is just to help out. Their relationship is made more clear in index so to speak... The arks in season 1 of railgun are just short adventures really, probably so far the level upper ark is intresting with the whole mad women scientist. I just have a problem with it's consistency... It's a bit all over the place... Like it doesn't know if it wants to be a simple slice of anime story about 4 girls or a HIGH PUMPING ACTION anime with lots of explosions! It's kind of off putting compared to another all girls anime like sailor moon.... But hey I also seen worse. This anime is at least watchable for the action hence the 4 stars.

I heard that the second season of railgun is far superior (Railgun S to be exact), although the case broke a bit on the bottom. Mostly due to the fact that the second season of railgun is more ""cannon"" so to speak to the index series since it takes roughly the same time as the first season of index.

If you like a bit of action thrown into your splice of anime then this anime is for you. It's no sailor moon but for an all girls anime it's pretty decent at least for this first season as I'm still watching it. I'm kind of surprised that one of the publishers is actually universal, kind of odd to see as a publisher but also it's the universal japan one not the american one so I guess not all that odd.

For the price you can't really complain, espeshally when there are 12 episode animes that cost double the amount of this these days.",1531958400,,4858,4.301639344262295
8684116,5,B00OLII9RI,"It's a great spinoff of the Index series that follows Railgun, probably the most interesting character from the series, and her friends. There are some parts that get a little girly, and they throw in some minor fan service for the boys to even it out. Other than that, it is a great series, and if you like A Certain Magical Index you'll probably like this.",1503273600,,358,4.4393939393939394
8684117,5,B00OLII9RI,"LOVE this show. I wasn't sure at first, because it's a little girly and bubbly. But it also has some great story from the beginning. I like how in contrast to Magical Index, this one ends the season strongly, and doesn't leave a cliffhanger (since I'm being a little slow at buying this series). Magical Index seemed to be at its strongest for the first half of the season, whereas this one seems to build up as you watch through it. Don't get me wrong, I love both first seasons, and can't wait to get the next ones and the movie!

In Magical Index, I was about so-so on Misaka (although I've loved her ability and skills from the get-go). After seeing her character develop in this season, I just love her so much. She's pretty complex, and I love that behind her rough exterior, she loves girly and childish stuff. I also enjoyed the new characters that this series brought in, and feel that they're all more well-rounded than many more basic characters can be.

Regardless of what genre you're into, I feel like this show has a little bit of everything to it, and I would recommend it to anyone who watches anime.",1502064000,,1117,4.443902439024391

(Similar stories can be found in the old TOEI classics of my youth&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>.)

This show is an odd one; it takes place in the same universe, in fact the very same place and partially ahead of the events of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Magical-Index-Season-1/dp/B00MP2G3C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Magical Index: Season 1</a>, and several characters are seen in both, including a certain spiky haired boy with a certain mysterious power negation in his right hand that drives Misaka Mikoto absolutely crazy.  In comparisons I've seen several comments to the effect that this is a somewhat sillier addition to the earlier story line, and while I will agree with that, I feel I must point out that when A Certain Scientific Railgun wants to get serious, it gets every bit as serious as the earlier series, as the season long, half the series interrelated stories about Level Uppers prove.  (In the climactic arc it takes the talents of almost all of the girls to stop the surprise major villain.)
