6798613,5,B00PGTN836,"in 1946 after the most horrific war in history, people where looking for answers and meaning for their lives. Hollywood joined in with movies like ""The Best Years of our Lives"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" . The Razor's Edge is my favorite. It's deals with material gain during the Roaring Twenties to the depression of the 30's. All along the main character Larry struggles with his desire for the beautiful Isabel vs his spiritual calling. In 1946 yoga wasn't very well known in the US and it's spiritual properties are portrayed in a clumsy way in this film but it's beautifully filmed and Anne Baxter's Sophie is incredible to watch",1425600000,5,635,4.72972972972973
6798614,4,B00PGTN836,"If you are a connoisseur of old films, here is one for you! I had never heard of it until I saw that Tyrone Power was in it, one of his best performances as a man returning home after WW1 to marry his love but has to find himself. Gene Tierney, well, she tended to go over the top so no difference here as the lady in question. Clifton Webb is her uncle and he is his snobbiest and snarkiest. John Payne, Herbert Marshall, Lucille Watson, Frank lattimore and the rest of the cast are superb. From the Parisian lifestyle to finding himself in the mountains of India, a great ride. Wonderful story, dialog, acting, visuals and pay particular attention to the amazing camera angles. Oh and Anne Baxter (never a fan) Thoroughly enjoyed it.",1425340800,2,735,4.451851851851852

6798616,4,B00PGTN836,"""The Razor's Edge""(1946) is the latest film from Fox's ""Studio Classics"" series to get an upgrade to Blu-ray and although it's not as pristine as some of their previous releases(""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"", ""The Three Faces of Eve"", ""A Letter to Three Wives"", ""Zorba the Greek"", etc.) it's still an excellent transfer which should make fans of the film and it's two stars(Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power) seriously think about upgrading if they already own the standard DVD. The film's storyline(one man's search for the meaning of life)  might not be to everyone's liking but it does hold the viewer's interest and contains some great performances, especially that of Anne Baxter as the tragic Sophie MacDonald which won her the Oscar. As for the Blu-ray presentation itself, Fox has given ""Edge"" a high Bitrate(37.21) and although this enhances the picture considerably it also detracts from the viewing experience as it makes many scenes appear ""brighter"" than they actually are. One prime example is during the opening few minutes of the film during the party scene where you can actually see the reflections from the studio lights on the actor's faces as they move about. The great Fox cinematographer, Arthur Miller, photographed ""Edge"" and it's in his close-ups of the actors where this new Blu-ray really shines. Close-ups are very clear and this is where you can see even the smallest details and emotions on the actor's faces. Filmed entirely on Fox soundstages, the set decorations and art direction are more vivid now on Blu-ray as are costumes and props. The only film damage occurs toward the end of the film where some of those ""white specs"" show up for a few frames but otherwise this is a very pleasing film presentation. It was a long film for it's time(145 minutes) and could have been edited better but after repeated viewings it grows on you. As for the acting, Producer Darryl F. Zanuck cast Maureen O'Hara in the lead as Isabel and told her to keep it a secret. She didn't and he fired her casting Gene Tierney instead. Tierney turns in an excellent performance as a woman who carries on a life long love of a man she can't have played by Tyrone Power. Tierney and Power get great support from John Payne, Clifton Webb, Herbert Marshall and Lucile Watson. However, as mentioned above, it is Anne Baxter who walks away with acting honors in her heartbreaking performance of the doomed Sophie. ""The Razor's Edge"" is 145 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH and Spanish. The Audio is English DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0 and Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0. Special features include commentaries by Film Historians and Fox Movietone News Footage of the movie's premiere and the 1946 Oscars. ""The Razor's Edge"" might not be to everyone's taste but is enjoyable nonetheless and Fox has given it new life on Blu-ray. Fans of Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney who own the previous ""Studio Classics"" DVD from 2005 will certainly want to consider an upgrade now that it is out on Blu-ray.",1423094400,11,3026,4.8757281553398055

8687813,3,B00PGTN836,"There is a moment, somewhere in the third act, that is so striking it almost saves this ship from sinking under its own ballast. Gene Tierney, all opera gloves and cheekbones in a ravishing turn as Isabel Bradley, inveigles recovering alcoholic Sophie MacDonald (Anne Baxter) off the wagon by leaving her alone with a bottle of exotic liquor. It is a test Isabel means for Sophie to fail. Baxter paces, stops, turns, goes to the window, fidgets her way around the room. A framed photo stops her -- it is Isabel's daughter, age seven. Sophie lifts the frame to her face, transfixed. All too aware that Sophie's crackup followed the death of her infant daughter some nine years earlier, Isabel swoops in for the kill, brandishing the photo with glee as she watches Sophie disintegrate where she stands. On that encouraging note Isabel turns and goes -- and few stars could leave a room with the frigid swagger of Gene Tierney. Sophie is alone, the photo replaced, the bottle on the table. We know what's coming, the wrestling, the relapse. But Edmund Goulding's pitiless blocking comes as a shock. No pacing, no hand-wringing, no camera back-and-forth between Anne Baxter and the bottle. Goulding places the camera behind Sophie, her back to us. Almost immediately she walks, neither fast nor slow, to the table, and without skipping a beat, she reaches for the bottle and pours and drinks. Like falling off a log, one straightforward fluid action, as if there were nothing for the character to consider and no other choices were possible. It is a stunning moment, against the grain of a film awash in spectacle, sentiment and faux profundity.

In 1946, a major studio release about a leading man's journey to the East may have surprised its audience and passed for profundity. Cukor's 1938 Holiday, to my mind the better picture, explores the same theme of loafing toward enlightenment. Watching it now, I concur with Gary Taylor's excellent Amazon review. The entire segment in India, on every level, approaches the unwatchable. (The hoary guru on the mountain top could have been the role model for R. Crumb's Mr. Natural.) Almost as silly is Somerset Maugham's conception of enlightenment: an Indian coin slapped in your palm can cure cluster headaches?

There's much to admire: Goulding's savvy staging, Newman's score, great work by the extras who create the Paris demimonde, Clifton Webb's nervy death scene, Herbert Marshall's voice, Tierney's face. Too content with snow-capped platitudes about love and enlightenment, THE RAZOR'S EDGE basks in itself, a guilty pleasure in the grand tradition of fabulous Hollywood pleasures.",1487030400,3,2633,5.050574712643678

8687820,5,B00PGTN836,"If you check a number of sources online, IMDb being just one, you'll find W. Somerset Maugham's great classis has been assigned to the Drama/Noir genre. This is a bit of a misnomer. Though there are certainly noirish elements employed in the film, lots of day for night shots and so forth, it leans more towards its more predominant designation that of a drama. Clearly, the film was not made on an austere modest little budget characteristic of most noir films of the period but is quite lavishly mounted or elsewise it would not have received an Oscar nomination for Best Art and Set Design, just as a case in point. Were Tyrone Power still around to extoll the virtues of this film adaption of Maugham he would probably tell you he felt his best work in film was a classic example of noir ""Nightmare Alley"". I would've disagreed with him. This is by far his best performance and should've been nominated for it but, alas, such is life and the machinations at work in Hollywood.",1436659200,,980,4.573863636363637
