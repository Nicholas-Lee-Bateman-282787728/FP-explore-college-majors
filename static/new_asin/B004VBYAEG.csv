8443191,3,B004VBYAEG,"While Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie's very first movie, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-Who-Was-a-Thief/dp/B001HTN5NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince Who Was a Thief</a>"", represents the best of the four times they were paired together, this second outing is excellent on its own merits. More so given that as time went on, the cute pixie-like energy Piper expressed in her earlier work slowly ebbed away to a more hardened, detached worldly woman in her later films. It's most noticeable when you watch 'Thief' and the second Arabian Nights film they did, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-Ali-Baba/dp/B00404NTVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of Ali Baba</a>"", one after the other. Although shot only four short years apart, the change she went through is stunning, sadly so. Gratefully, in this production, that process had not completely taken hold.

In 'Groom', Tony and Piper play recently married young couple Alvah and Lee, respectively.

Alvah is an Army private about to be shipped overseas and Lee is the very pretty girl he met while on leave. They've fallen deeply in love and have decided to legalize their relationship with a sanctioned union.

Love, however, does not seem to be enough. Lee's newly installed mother-in-law is vehemently opposed to their match. The reason for her opposition isn't explained in the beginning of the film, but she makes her position very clear soon thereafter; much to the regret of all involved.

And it seems that even fate itself against them.

Tragically, their first night as husband and wife, Alvah comes down with chicken pox. And by the time he recovers, his unit has to ship out; he's not returning to the states for nearly a year. Lee promises to wait. In the meantime, he gives her the keys to his home in the California wine country. It's the house his grandfather built right above a small plot of land for the family vineyards. And it's the home he's promised her will be where they raise their bambinos and their bambino's bambinos.

Nearly a year passes.

Alvah is finally home for good. Having completed his overseas stint, his unit will be stationed stateside for the remainder of his enlistment. And he's looking forward to finally becoming a married man, and hopefully a family man. He steps off the bus and races home to Lee and finds - a stranger answering his door.

The confrontational hillbilly has the nerve to question him like a guard dog. Alvah politely excuses the intruder and goes in to find a strange woman. And then some strange children. Then more strange men and more strange women, and even more strange children. He's more than a bit confused and even scared for his timid young bride. He can't imagine her fighting off a horde of squatters and hobos. And just as he's about to call the police, there she is, cooking over a hot stove.

Their embrace is joyous, but brief. Now the questions come.

The previously unseen mother 'decided' it would be best that Lee not live by herself in a town so far away from home. Mother is there to protect her while her husband is away. Which makes sense to Alvah. But then what about the dozen *other* people who are inhabiting their home? Extended family is the explanation. All of whom look and answer to Mother as the big chicken of the coop.

Alvah quickly realizes that he's the impediment to Mama's longterm goals. Explaining to Lee that she's nothing more than a bargaining chip to a better life, one that benefits her mother best, falls on deaf ears and rose-tinted spectacles.

Throw in a rival local business, rival would-be-suitor to Lee, a steady stream of lawyers, psychiatrists and a really annoying evil kid - and you get 'No Room For The Groom'.

As the antics and manipulations grow to a manic crescendo - Alvah decides he's had enough. Reenlisting for another overseas duty assignment, Lee's mother can have everything. He's understandably walking away from the madness.

Do Alvah and Lee rediscover their love in time?

Great flick if you're in the mood for some masochistic comedy.

In truth, I can only watch this in small bursts. My level of anger and frustration quickly boils over if I attempt to go through this in one sitting; hitting a bit too close to home for me and my first real relationship. But I never get tired of seeing Piper during these years - never. And that final scene with the young couple in love is such an amazing payoff.

Personal Note:

- One of several Tony Curtis films that unfortunately has yet to find a release in the very country where it was created. As such, I'm reviewing the DVD from Amazon's French division. To date only three of the four films he and Piper Laurie did together are available in any kind of a digital format - notably, none from US vendors. An incredibly bizarre and annoying situation that the films Curtis and Laurie did over their careers are not readily available as digital products in the US marketplace.

I recognize there are many legal issues to work out, but these movies were made some 60 years ago. You'd think the interested parties would have long ago been able to settle their respective positions by now. Even if you were a young thirty-something entertainment lawyer when home videos were first marketed in the early 1980s, you'd now be in your sixties in 2011. Fairly long time to be stuck in litigation limbo arguing over a few shekels.",1317513600,7,5453,4.939890710382514
