We discover that the characters we love so much have a life outside the montecito !
Congrats Vanessa Marcil !
She shines through the whole season !
Can't wait for season 5!!",1199664000,2,222,4.162790697674419
2892311,5,B000T28PU6,"My husband loves this series, he has the entire set.  He was very excited about this season and is very happy with my purchase.  However he would like more outtakes or bloopers included on the DVD collections:)",1197417600,,210,4.648648648648648
2892312,5,B000T28PU6,Great TV series which captivates the imagination.  Always entertaining from disc 1 to the end.,1193788800,,94,5.266666666666667
2892313,4,B000T28PU6,"Overall season 4 is great again! Very funny and cool stuff! But do not watch the last episode. It is the worst Vegas episode so far. Very bad writing. A stupid plot and a total waist of time.
Without the last episode season 4 might be the best Las Vegas yet. A great show for sure.",1193270400,,281,4.035714285714286
2892314,5,B000T28PU6,"I love Las Vegas! I like the writing, the acting, the characters, the back stories...it all meshes together for a great show. The show is action packed and easy to watch over and over again. Without giving away any spoilers, I thought the finale was great! I can't wait to see how all of the plots end up. I wonder how it's going to be without a couple of the main characters, but I'm sure the rest of the cast can pull it off. Definitely worth a chance if you haven't seen the show yet. If you have....get ready, it's a wild ride, all the way to the end!",1190678400,11,555,4.10091743119266
2892315,3,B000T28PU6,"I like this series from since the first episode, light violence, beautiful ladies, enjoying plot. I buy the first three seasons, and my wife enjoy them too because she now can understand better the episodes thanks to the subtitles, and this season don't have it. Now i have to sit next to her to traduce every time she doesn't understand something.

Shame on you, remember the latinos always!  :)",1190073600,3,396,4.72463768115942
2892316,5,B000T28PU6,"I've watched Las Vegas since the show premiered in 2003 and it just keeps getting better and better for me. This show has it all. Glitz, glamour, an extremely gorgeous cast, and a great mix of danger, intrigue, and fun. Josh Duhamel, James Caan, and Vanessa Marcil shine in this sleek and sexy drama.

The fourth season of Vegas took on a slightly different vibe than the previous seasons. It centered around the emotion of the characters in greater fashion than any of the previous seasons. The love triangle of Mary, Danny, and Delinda remained forefront. Friendships were challenged as Mary struggled to deal with the secrets her friends had kept from her. Meanwhile, Ed's CIA past came back to haunt him when his old enemies kidnapped Delinda. This story is featured in an action packed two hour 'movie' type episode titled ""Delinda's Box."" Ed and Danny fight to get Delinda back while she ends up buried alive in quite a thriller.

Other season highlights include a never before done Christmas Episode and the annual fan favorite Crossing Jordan/Las Vegas crossover that once again brings Jordan and Woody to Vegas on a crime solving/romantic mission.

The best part of the season are the last three episodes. They really kick off the drama leading up to Vegas's best season finale ""Heroes."" We find out Casey Manning, Sam's ex-husband dies and leaves her control of his fortune and the entire Montecito casino. Unfortunately for Sam, Casey has leveraged the casino, and owes hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.  If they don't come up with the money, the casino is going on the auction block.

Sam and Ed team up to try and raise money to buy the casino, but their plans are interrupted when one of Sam's high rollers Vince Peterson (played by Desperate Housewives Richard Burgi), viciously kidnaps Sam and manages to fly away with her. Richard Burgi does an incredible job as the evil Vince and Vanessa Marcil does some of her best work portraying Sam's horror and anguish as a victim and as a fighter.

The last three episodes also bring to the forefront Mary's story of childhood molestation. In season one we found out that Mary's father had abused her as a child and she's been estranged from him ever since. Her past comes walking back into her life in the form of her two little sisters. The little girls have been harmed by their father and their mother begs Mary to testify in court against him. Mary reluctantly agrees and when her father is acquitted, Mary breaks down and goes after him with a gun.

Meanwhile, Delinda finds out she's pregnant with Danny's child but keeps missing her chance to tell him her news. An old war buddy of Danny's has arrived at the casino wanting Danny to save him from going back to war. Between Mary's crisis and this new crisis Danny doesn't have a lot of time for Delinda.

Season four comes to a head in the last 5 minutes of the season finale when Vince fly's off with a kidnapped Sam as Mike is running after her literally on the airport tarmac. Mary becomes unhinged and shoots her father just as Danny and Ed also arrive firing their guns. Then in the very last moment, Danny's unhinged war buddy commits suicide by blowing up his room in the casino with Delinda inside.

This is the biggest cliffhanger I've ever seen any series do. Season Five will be a great ride. I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who loves high action entertainment.",1189468800,24,3407,4.665
2892317,5,B000T28PU6,"if you liked seasons one through three then you will like season four the whole season was awesome and all the witty candor,action and everything else you have come to like from this show remains intact.

My wife and I were watching all five seasons of LAS VEGAS again on DVD. We loved LAS VEGAS, the show (and city), and are enjoying the series all over again thanks to this collection. In Season Four, there is the WHITE CHRISTMAS (Episode 7) show. Gary Scott Thompson was the writer/creator of this series and, if somehow you're reading these reviews from time/time Gary, you, sir, created a jewel with this episode. The word I would use is POIGNANT. You brought tears to my eyes, each time I had seen this episode, with the Christmas Eve death of Sam's ""whale,"" the poor little abandoned kids Danny found in that cold/empty house, and the joy of the entire cast assembled in that garage telling Danny they were going to rebuild his beloved car destroyed due to a car theft. With the entire cast admiring the falling snow (it does happen, but not often, in Vegas) and the fitting ""Season's Greetings From Las Vegas"" picture card at the very end, it has to be my favorite episode ... thank you!",1406851200,,1275,5.407035175879397

2892460,5,B000T28PU6,I had to feed her hunger for the rest of the series and it was great for her to sit down on her airplane trip and get lost in the escapades of the Las Vegas cast.  This is about the time in the series when they are making tweaks to the cast so it was fun for her to watch the plot development.

2892497,1,B000T28PU6,I had hoped the series what a drama type where each week the characters developed and there was an extending story line from episode to episode.  This is not the way the series was written and I'm very dissapointed,1370390400,,214,4.487179487179487
2892498,5,B000T28PU6,"The Las Vegas hijinks do not disappoint. Danny and Mike are still a great team, as they try to live up to the expectations of their fearless, tightly-wound leader, Ed. Sam is in perfect form as her usual cynical, manipulative, twisted self. Delinda is... well, Delinda, the little princess. Mary is even more of a sad sack, and it almost becomes too much, but luckily, that storyline finally moves on to better things.
If you are like me, and capable of watching a show, with your imagination pulling a suspension of disbelief, then you will have a good time with season four. It's got all of the stuff that made the previous Las Vegas seasons oh so fun, like half naked pretty people, greed, robberies, kidnappings, and explosions. We also get to again be a part of the bickering and camaraderie, that occurs among our six casino cohorts, as they try to keep the Montecito running smoothly for another day.",1367452800,,907,4.675

2892554,4,B000T28PU6,I love Las Vegas the series.  IN some ways it was campy and it definitely was pre-recession of 2008 in terms of being over the top but it does evoke that time perfectly.

However I would not have given anyone a job for doing nothing. Why couldn't the the Gang leader want to better someone in his family and that be a positive on the show. All Black People are not thugs and some who are want their siblings to become ligit. College Educated,Lawyers,Doctors,Educators. Danny getting his butt kicked as a trade off for a favor BS. Big Ed. should not have bugged their home but since Danny made a poor decision that would be the result. Glad Mary's Dad was whacked all child molestors should be. also the nagging wife of Ed's that should have been written out. To bad Danny Married Delinda . I still love the show.

2892575,4,B000T28PU6,"Las Vegas has always been a TV show that did the thing it was meant to do, and thats entertain me.

Sure it is a little bit shorter than the other seasons but even still is definitely worth it if you enjoyed the previous seasons.
There are some good episodes like when Sam finds a dead stripper in one of her clients rooms or the Xmas episode where Danny's car gets stolen, then destroyed.

Las Vegas is a enjoyable experience with plenty of laughs to be had, no question a keeper.",1216425600,3,481,4.274725274725275

2892577,5,B000T28PU6,I have the entire series in my library with the exception of Season Five which isn't out yet. The character developement during the years it was on TV endeared you to the cast. My wife and I looked forward each week to the next installment and we are hoping the powers that be will consider a movie or two in the future.. Anyway once you start watching you will get hooked...,1209686400,,375,4.295774647887324

2892580,4,B000T28PU6,"What can I say?  I love Vegas, I love the cast...  It's always enjoyable, even if its often predictable and quite frequently downright silly in its plot.  Often though, it is laugh-out-loud funny, which I greatly appreciate.

Its a guilty pleasure to be sure...",1205107200,,261,4.863636363636363
