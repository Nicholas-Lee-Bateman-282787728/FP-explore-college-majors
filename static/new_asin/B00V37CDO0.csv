A SWAT team is sent into an insane asylum because the prisoners have broken out and rioted, taking hostages. Sounded interesting. But, that isn't what you actually get. What you get is a jumbled mess of a half movie. Apparently, the actual footage shot was so bad, or so incomplete, that the producers decided the only way to try to salvage this movie was to throw in ""real life"" footage about the ""making"" of this schlock film in some made up country. To top off that bad side story, the movie itself is being edited by these two guys in a basement, who literally make fun of the entire movie as they watch it. That could have been entertaining, but they talk over all of the actual dialogue through the real movie, so half of the actual movie itself is lost because of their voice over sarcasms.
If they had bothered to come up with a real beginning and a real ending for this movie it might have been salvageable. The plot was half way decent. I could even accept that the possessed inmates were zombies, or some form of lifeless shells after their possession. I mean, wouldn't be the first time I've seen that in a movie. But where was the actual movie? All they did was throw bad ""real world"" voice overs into the whole thing, which leaves you with some nice horror movie shots on a screen and sarcastic poking fun at the actual film. I got about half an hour into it before I fast forwarded to the end to see how it ended. I couldn't watch this movie. It was horrible. Don't waste your time. Or your money. Trust me on this, this one isn't worth either.",1468022400,,1647,4.333333333333333
8708983,1,B00V37CDO0,"I didn't realize this film was a horror-comedy, with two nerdy guys trying to explain what the movie was about. I was very disappointed, thinking it was a horror movie. I just lost my money. The movie sucks and the best place for it is in the trash can.",1451779200,,253,4.183673469387755
8708984,2,B00V37CDO0,"What this movie is obviously a last ditch salvage attempt by the movie producers to turn a potentially bad movie into its own parody. The editors didn't even bother finishing the original film because the submitted cut was so unexpectedly bad, they apparently decided to make fun of its raw-cut through peculiar editor commentary shots while ironically admitting to creating a bait-and-switch trailer. It is understandable that any horror fan would be infuriated, but the shameless attempt is quite strange and comical at the same time. The trailer contained more special effects than the entire movie that only captioned the FX intents. I felt absolutely terrible for the actors who unwittingly participated and actually got made fun of by its own producers, but this was a memorable baffling viewing experience.",1438992000,3,813,5.2615384615384615

8708986,2,B00V37CDO0,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive mentioned before how much I love the After Dark Originals brand from Lionsgate.  The films are usually fun, and some are just downright awesome.  The series latest release, ASYLUM, puts me in an odd position, however.  I cant really decide which side of the fence I am on in regard to it.  Part of me loved it, but another part of me didn't like it at all.  In short, Im conflicted, and I don't think this is going to resolve itself anytime soon.

First off, the description for this film is very misleading.  Yes, that is the basis for the plotbut for the movie WITHIN the movie.  Let me explain:  the plot above is for a film that was shot in another country, and it is the film that two editors in the outer movie are watching while they comment on it.  Basically, this is sort of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 setup.  The outer film is very campy and comedic, while the actual horror film seems to be dark and serious.  This contrast is one of the reasons I disliked the film overall.

The inner film (the actual ASYLUM movie) is shot well for the most part and looks nice and dark onscreen.  The outer film looks more like a home movie, and its picture quality is not as good.  Once again, this contrast throws the production value off as a whole, and the resulting product does not look as professional as it could have.

One major drawback of the inner film is that it is not complete.  This is done on purpose, as the editors are supposedly watching the footage to splice it together (even though it already is), but it really detracts from the film experience.  There are several scenes where wording pops up on the screen to note missing visual effects or whatnot, but I really did not like this; it took me completely out of the viewing experience for both films.

If you look at ASYLUM as a horror-comedy or as a MST3K spin-off, it almost works.  I actually chuckled at the editors dialogue a couple of times because they were spot on with their comical assessment of the movies situation.  But if you look at this is being a true horror film (which, honestly, is what the plot synopsis advertises this as), then it fails miserably.  The inner film could actually be relevant as a decent horror flick, but only if it wasn't attached to the outer film.

Overall, Im still torn on this one, and as such, I cant recommend it in good conscience.  If I had known it was horror-comedy going into it, my perception would would have been different and therefore my feelings would have been, too.  But since I was expecting an actual horror flick, I cant say this one succeeds.",1433289600,,2659,4.408624229979466
8708987,2,B00V37CDO0,"Are you kidding me ? This is a huge MESS! The film itself is about a riot squad that gets called to an asylum to handle a situation where inmates have escaped and take hostages! They also turn into zombie like creatures. It could have been Ok if we didn't have to listen to listen to  two morons spouting a Mystery Science Theater 3000 type voice over during the entire film! It's of course intended to be fun and comical and it ""might"" be if you're a 10-15 year old boy or very stoned!

Complete waste of time and money. The only upside is that (Stephen Rea) is in it but the voice over guys call him""the dude from the Crying Game"". A film n which he is most famous for . After Dark Films have really gone to Hell and not in a good way. I use to love the( 8 Films To Die For) film fest.",1433203200,3,787,3.9746835443037973
