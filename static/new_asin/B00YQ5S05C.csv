7223788,5,B00YQ5S05C,this is a great movie. i am not a jack black fan so when i saw him on the cover i was disappointed in my wifes choice to rent this. however this is not a typical jack black movie. it is a real film with real acting and a real plot. the plot twists are absolutely courageous and surprising and kept me glued to the screen. fantastic acting with alot of top perfomers. i even found the ending to be conclusive which most movies do not do well with. it isn't open ended and there won't be a sequel but i hope jack black continues to evolve as a serious actor. this movie definately displays his range and now i am almost a jack black fan. this movie is not for kids. there are references to sex and drugs throughout.,1445817600,,713,4.1
7223789,3,B00YQ5S05C,"The fact that I pressed pause in order to do this review is a first for me, and I have no idea if that's a good thing or not. The movie centers around ""Dan"", the married un-popular self-proclaimed chair of his High School reunion committee; several scenes in the first half hour tells the viewer he was equally un-popular in High School as well. The movie never explains how he managed to even cross paths with wife ""Stacey"" (Kathryn Hahn) in High School letalong marry her soon after; she's alluded to as being attractive, fairly popular, and liked back then.

I am no prude and have watched a few old-school X-rated/NC-17 flicks in the past, but within the first twenty minutes I found ""Dan"" (Black) and his behavior reprehensible (primarily how he treated his boss); and was tempted to stop watching. However, this is certainly a film where an actor, Jack Black, is outstanding and exudes their craft well; even if the character in question is not likable and/or poorly written. In this case, ""Dan"" probably has some diagnosible mental illness, but regardless I have yet to see any redeeming qualities in this character.

I'm about 75% through the movie at the time of the original posting of this review. This film is NOT for everyone: it isn't light-hearted, it's not a ""feel-good"" J. B. vehicle, and it definitely is NOT Hollywood fluff. This is one of those flicks that'll make you think.

UPDATE:
The ending was haphazardly done, complete rubbish! The entire film had a depressing undertone and in the end they tried to turn it into a J.B. vehicle as if they didn't realize he was there before. The last five minutes are a complete waste and unfunny.",1443312000,,1658,4.710344827586207

7223791,4,B00YQ5S05C,Very twisted comedy. Great performances by Black and Marsden. Definitely a must buy but not worth Amazon's current $35.99 price tag !,1441497600,,133,5.090909090909091
7223792,3,B00YQ5S05C,"""I'm going to get my friend Oliver Lawless to come to this reunion."" Dan (Black) is the head of the high school reunion committee and has very few real friends. When the attendence of this year's reunion is projected to be very low he begins to look for ways to bring people back. When he sees an old classmate TV he thinks that if he can get Oliver (Marsden) to go everyone else will come as well. He flies to LA to meet him, after which Dan begins to rethink his idea. This is a movie that is a little deceiving based on the trailer. The movie does have funny moments and I would call this a comedy, but there are some very dark and dramatic elements to this. This is also not a typical Jack Black movie at all, so if you are looking for the Jack you are used to don't say I didn't warn you. As for the movie I did really like it, but it was very dark and much more depressing than I was expecting. I am also not a Jack Black fan. I think he tries to hard and goes way over the top straight to annoying instead of funny. That said this may be his best performance yet, besides Bernie. Both him and Marsden play characters they really haven't ever done before, and they both pull them off expertly. Overall, a movie that I really liked and is a total departure for both Black and Marsden in terms of acting. I do recommend this and I think it is one of (if not the) best Jack Black movie yet. I give it a B.",1440979200,9,1408,4.01423487544484

7223794,1,B00YQ5S05C,"I walked out of the theater after the first 20 minutes of it. I originally was going to see ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" but instead, it was this movie that was playing in the auditorium that ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" was supposed to be shown in. This movie is NOT for anyone who is a devoted catholic Christian who has come a long ways (like me). You want a great Jack Black flick? Give ""Nacho Libre"", ""Shallow Hal"", or ""Saving Silverman a try"". Peter Smith",1435363200,4,451,4.195402298850575

8718763,2,B00YQ5S05C,"SPOILER ALERT!!!  Wow is this movie disturbing.  I don't mean in a scary movie way.  I mean in a gay prison rape, cannibal holocaust way.  There is such a mean undertone to this film.  A loser father who lies and screws over his wife, his needy son and his kind boss.  A group of high school alumni that openly hates and disrespects him.  And of course getting booty raped by his male classmate.  This is not a pleasant film.  I like Jack Black in almost everything, but not this.",1491868800,,480,4.303370786516854

8718765,4,B00YQ5S05C,"To say it plain and simple: I enjoyed this movie. I am shocked (not by
the movie but) by all the negative comments. I thought that Jack Black
was great in it -not that he isn't great in his other movies (Kings of
Rock- grrreat!), but I think it is because there was a bigger depth to
this character than most of his other movies), D-Train does not reach
the greatness of Black's Orange County or Shallow Hal (both superb
movies!), but it was a fresh and entertaining look at midlife crises
and Highschool reunions. James Marsden stars as Black's equally great
counterpart, I really liked him in this maybe morally a bit deviant but
likable role - in the end his character is not a mean guy, but actually
(and sadly) just pretty lost. Sure, the movie was not the obvious
alumni meeting movie/what I expected, but this is a good thing. I was
afraid it was gonna turn out as something about long-kept jealousy and
some only rooster in the yard clinch, but fortunately it wasn't. It was
a delicate, tender story about life choices, desire for friendships,
attention and recognition, and coming to terms with your place in life.
And done in a very entertaining, funny, original way. I did not see the
turns and twists coming, but they did not shock but entertain and enjoy
me. Come on, it also features the great Kathryn Hahn and cultish 80ies
music - gotta love that! I only felt bad for the nice boss, Bill, but
if I understood the ending right, this side story ended well, too. So
give it a shot, be prepared for something different and enjoy!",1478131200,2,1541,4.487544483985765

8718767,5,B00YQ5S05C,I would give it 4stars but since someone who never watched the whole movie gave it 1 star. I am balancing it out.  4 stars because of the abrupt change from silly to serious (think Tyler Perry Madea movies) If you give the movie a chance you will find the main characters are not just one dimensional (think Golden Girls) and I like that you really don't get answers to obvious questions unlike how most movies like to tie things up at the end. I like how it also shows (temporary)sexual fluidity which most movies don't and most people don't talk about.  The son was very believable as a teen.,1467676800,3,594,4.390909090909091
