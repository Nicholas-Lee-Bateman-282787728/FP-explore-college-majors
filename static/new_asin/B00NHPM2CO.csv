8678283,2,B00NHPM2CO,This film would be fine if the film transfer were any good. It is not! A shame really as the story is fine. The DVD is a mess. I don't think this video outfit gave a damn about it. Look for a better transfer of this Li'l Abner film elsewhere.,1494374400,2,242,3.86
8678284,4,B00NHPM2CO,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as FILMCHEST) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

The first LI'L ABNER movie brought Al Capp's Dogpatch characters vividly to life and is in many respects superior to the screen adaptation of the 1950s ""Abner"" Broadway musical.

After costuming and much makeup, this picture's cast were dead ringers for the newspaper comic folks they portrayed. In particular, Buster Keaton as Lonesome Polecat deserves mention. He is perfect and hilarious as the strange little Indian that brews cauldrons of Kickapoo Joy Juice. Also seen are many other silent era comics. (Doodles Weaver, of Spike Jones ""Feitelbaum"" fame, cameos as a local yokel. Befreckled former silent era Our Ganger Mickey Daniels has a few lines as doofus Cicero Grunts.)

Here, an average plot is assisted by spot-on performances. Fans of Capp's work will definitely NOT be disappointed in this little comedy that's still as yummy as ""poke chops fo' brekfiss, poke chops fo' lunch, and fo' suppah....MO' poke chops!!""
