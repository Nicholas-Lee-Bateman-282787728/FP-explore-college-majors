8382305,5,B002VM7FI0,"This 3 DVD Skinny Bitch collection is the best thing that happened to me when I finally decided to change my body.  My lifestyle is already vegan so no big stretch there, and only adds to the girls' own philosophy.  I am not a big fan of exercising at all, so I was a little scared when I first started.  Now, of course, I'm an addict.  The DVDs are resplendent with all kinds of routines - if you want to see lose weight, tone your muscles and body, just spruce it up a little and even do little 5 minute exercises when you don't have much time (or on your period).  I'm definitely seeing the results already - feeling energized in the morning, losing weight and toning my body!  WARNING: If you are an exercise nut and are used to routines like Tae Bo and Insanity and other boot campy things, this is definitely NOT for you!  Many people have trashed this series as too easy and even silly.  It is designed for women who are not workout-holics, are just starting out and want to get into shape.  The girls themselves are not professional either and that's what I love about it too - they mess up sometimes. And if you expect perfection, you will not find it here. These girls are authors, not professional trainers, and are just branching out after writing Skinny Bitch (which I recommend endlessly!) The pace of the DVDs is relaxed yet energetic enough to get you groovin' and even kick your ass.  I love their zen attitude, and trainer Patrick Goudeau's borrowing from yoga, aerobics, dance, and hip-hop.  Rory and Kim are hilarious and will set you at ease (even if using some unorthodox language).  It's like exercising with two good girlfriends. You will see the results and feel better and lighter instantly.",1360022400,,1717,4.5210355987055015
8382306,4,B002VM7FI0,"This is a moderate to easy work out if you are already fairly physically fit.

The girls are a lot of fun.  They slip educational tidbits into their banter throughout the work out.

At times the camera positioning makes it hard to see exactly what the moves are.

If you are fit and looking for a work out that kicks your butt, try Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred.",1356566400,,362,4.279411764705882
8382307,5,B002VM7FI0,"I LOVE LOVE the Skinny Bitch Bootcamp workout and the Body is great too. The Bootcamp kicks my butt - I do it 3X a week and when I skip a workout or two I definitely feel it when I get back into. It works a lot of different body parts and makes you sweat out the bad stuff. This is actually my second copy -- I LOVE it so much I want a back up copy :) The Body video is great too and I throw that one in the mix  when I wanna shake up my routine workouts. Fun ladies - great workout. I haven't tried the Booty Bounce one yet, but have watched parts - someday, maybe. For now, I LOVE the other two :)",1352160000,,599,3.6796875
8382308,3,B002VM7FI0,"The product was new just like the seller said, but the product itself wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  The workouts are not very hard and I barely worked up a sweat.  I would buy from this seller again.  Delivery was on time and in good condition.  Thanks! Guess I'll have to stick to the gym, though.",1318291200,3,310,4.116666666666666
8382309,1,B002VM7FI0,I was extremely unhappy with this product because none of the cds even worked. They were all glitchy and so was the sound. I couldn't do any of my workouts,1318032000,2,155,4.2
