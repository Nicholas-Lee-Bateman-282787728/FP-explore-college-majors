1785398,1,B00006LPBW,"Okay, so i'm not that coordinated - but this was insane. I suppose i would get a great workout, in a year, when i finally learned the amazingly high speed, rapidly changing aerobo-dance moves. I'm returning this immediately!!!!",1116979200,,227,5.0
1785399,3,B00006LPBW,"Regarding this Kathy Smith video, I must agree with a number of the other reviewers in that there is not any structured warmup or cool down session, an important item for any workout.  It does not seem like it would be that hard for them to have added these choices since this is an interactive dvd.  In the beginning of the video there is a section that explains the logic of fatburning, and how to structure you workout, then the video itself is structured for you to be able to tailor what you are doing to get results based on their logic---the major part that is missing is the warmup and cooldown.  As for each of the individual sections of workout, they were pretty helpful but leaving you feeling kind of breathless between segments, without a good transition stage, and a bit hyper when done unless you add your own cooldown.  Hope this helps.......",1105228800,6,858,4.5519480519480515
1785400,4,B00006LPBW,"I love the low-slow cardio segment.  It is diferents steps and she adds more and more steps to it but at first you can be overwhelmed learnig it but I took about a week and keep rewinding and rewinding learning the steps and now is so much fun to workout to.

There are a total of 6 segments.  I enjoy the lower body segment.

I don't do the other segments.  But I would definitely recomend purchasing the dvd just for these segments.

And quite a few reviews complain about no warm up.  Who cares just do your own stretches before and after you watch the dvd.",1094515200,3,560,4.226415094339623
1785401,4,B00006LPBW,"I read the reviews of this DVD and then bought it. I was excited by the fact it has different segments you can choose from even though I knew it didn't have a warm-up and cool down.  This was my first day using it, and I have to say even though I loved the workout, I really did miss having a guided warm up at the beginning and cool down with stretching at the end.  I go to aerobics classes regularly and I know how important those are.

That being said, I would definately reccomend this video to anyone who is used to working out and can do a warm-up and cool down with stretching on your own. If you know nothing about working out, wait on this one a while, or buy separate dvds with a warm up and cool down and follow those before and after you work out.

Don't discount this DVD completey though. Its so cool how you can program in your own workout for the day. I've never seen anything like that. And, Kathy is definately my favorite instructor.",1092787200,7,953,4.163043478260869
1785402,4,B00006LPBW,"I am pretty much a beginner, but I must say this is a great DVD to buy!  It is compiled of segments from some of her previous videos, so if you have those, you may not want this.  But if you don't have them, definitely give this a try because you can program your own workout which I love!  You can choose from two long-slow workouts, two interval workouts, and an upper and a lower body strength training.  I also love the first segment where Kathy tells you the ""rules of fat burning"".  There were only a few things about this DVD I didn't care for.  First is that there is no warm up.  You may want to do some stretches or pop in a yoga DVD before doing this.  Same with cooldowns.  Second is that I assumed the long-slow cardios would be more of a beginner level, but they are more of an intermediate to advanced level to me.  I clocked a segment at 136 bmp (some other videos I use are at around 130).  I don't have much of a problem with that, I need the push, but the ""dance moves"" are a little confusing and it took me a while to catch on.  Third is that during some of the workouts she and the other people get a little loud and hyper.  In some ways that can really get you going and smile along with them, but if you're really trying to concentrate it can be annoying.  But Kathy definitely isn't as annoying as some instructors I've seen so overall I'd say she's a great modivator.  This DVD will definitely stay in my favorites!",1077235200,3,1440,4.148014440433213
1785403,3,B00006LPBW,"This workout is divided into ""best of"" sections of high impact cardio and low impact cardio in 15 and 20 minute segments.  The cardio is okay, but there aren't any warm up or cool downs which I think is a real drawback.  Also, one workout is with a jump rope which I think is silly because most people who bought this are working out at home, so jumping rope is impractical.  The weight training sections are really good , but there is no ab section so that was disappointing.  Overall, something I will use several times per week.",1077062400,2,531,4.387755102040816
1785404,2,B00006LPBW,this workout does not flow well. there is a complete lack of warm up and no focus on the abdominals. some of the sections are targeting only one or two muscle groups. difficult to do some of the moves in a living room because of the lack of space.,1042848000,2,247,4.061224489795919
1785405,1,B00006LPBW,"The Rules of Fat Burning is a newly formatted DVD that contains 6 workout segments. The segments are composed of:
- Two Long-Slow Cardio Routines
- Two Interval Workouts
- Upper and Lower Body Strength training
The total workout time is approximately two hours if you run all of the segments.
The DVD has a unique feature in that allows you to program your workout. You can choose which segment you want to do when. The segments are taken from older releases - Aerobox, Functionally Fit, Lift Weights to Lose Weight, Kickboxing, and Cardio Fat Burner. There are no new workouts on this disc.
Unfortunately, the disc does not include a warm-up or a cool down. For beginners, they may not warm up before getting started and jumping right in to the workouts. The disc also makes no mention of warming up or cooling down before your workout. Bear in mind that warming up and cooling down are essential to a safe workout, and be sure to do them when using this DVD.
The DVD includes a bonus feature of Kathy discussing the theory behind these workouts. She presents different methods of fat burning, and includes charts and graphs to further illustrate the presentation.
On the whole, I would recommend Kathy's Personal Trainer instead of this DVD. The Personal Trainer includes warm up and cool down segments, as well as a Yoga segment. This disc does not include any stretching exercises. I don't think this DVD is as well rounded as the Personal Trainer DVD was.",1040860800,10,1460,4.70703125
7971737,4,B00006LPBW,"I've used this video since the early 2000's.  I like that you can ""design"" your own workout and choose what sequence you want to do.  You can do the workouts to your own level of comfort.  It can feel a bit repetitive, but that also makes it easy to follow along.  My kids make fun of the 90's haircuts and outfits, but calorie burning is calorie burning!",1463443200,,355,4.253731343283582
7971738,5,B00006LPBW,"Rushed to order this when my old DVD was somehow cracked. I only use the upper and lower body strength training workouts on this video.  I am always sore the next day.  The squats and lunges have really toned my legs and glutes, but sometimes I take a few days off because the lower body workout is hard on my knees.  I could see and feel more muscle tone in my arms after 3 to 4 of Kathy's upper body sessions, and my posture has improved because she incorporates work for the traps, deltoids, lats, and rhomboids.  The chest work is also helping me as a large breasted lady.  A staple in my workout video collection!",1457481600,3,618,4.293103448275862
7971739,5,B00006LPBW,I love the fact you can program your exercise routine. This is my second time I ordered this an I got one for my friend,1402099200,,119,3.8
7971740,5,B00006LPBW,"This is a great Kathy Smith work out video, helped me lose some weight without making me feel like I was going to pass out.",1400112000,,123,3.96
7971741,5,B00006LPBW,This is a great medium intensity workout. The moves are simple and easily modifiable to be harder or easier. Her cues are clear and there are background exercisers to follow along with to fit your level. The workout flies by quickly for me.,1356739200,,240,4.604651162790698
7971742,1,B00006LPBW,"I was excited to take this DVD home, but discouraged as the first few minutes (what felt like an eternity) she was discussing fat and calories.  I was hoping to get right into the aerobics.

And then, the aerobics came on. There was no description on how to get into the moves.  In fact, I felt like a complete idiot in the privacy of my own home, trying to keep up with her and get the correct moves.  As soon as I thought I got the moves right, she went into a different set of fast moves.  Perhaps I am not coordinated, or this is really not for beginners like it said.

I gave up on the video after 3 minutes of trying to exercise. I may not return it, but I don't think I'll be using it anytime soon.  I will move on to someone who helps direct you through the fitness.  I bought this video in the discount bin, and was instantly reminded you get what you pay for.",1181692800,,869,4.04093567251462
7971743,5,B00006LPBW,"Overall, this has to be one of Kathy's best DVD's!  Not only does Kathy provide 4 different, challenging, and fun cardio workout, she also provides two weight lifting segments.  ALL SIX of the workouts are challenging whether I've been doing them for weeks straight or have just popped one in to supplement another workout.  Kathy is fun and lively--I always find her encouraging (even when she's pushing me to my limits).

And, I love that Kathy doesn't repeat herself constantly.  Sure, Kathy moves fast and you may have to rewind the video a few times when you first start out (which is the benefit of working out with a video and not with a live instructor), but this allows you to go through the workout without stopping once you have it down--a major plus if your going to continue to use the video for several years, as I have.  Several previous reviewers have complained about this aspect of her video--they must not be willing to work hard.  If you don't understand a move, rewind and push the <slow> option on the remote!  Being physically fit doesn't just fall into your lap; it takes effort!",1170979200,2,1103,4.649484536082475
7971744,4,B00006LPBW,"In this video, instructor Kathy Smith has taken portions of her previously released workouts, chaptered them, and organized them on one nice, programmable DVD.  The excellent chapter menu allows you to choose amongst each of the six workouts offered, and you can program them to play in any order you would like, doing just one workout or all six; you can even select the same workout more than once.  The six workouts are comprised of two ""long slow"" cardio segments, two interval cardio segments, and two weight training workouts.  Full descriptions are provided below.

1) Long Slow 1, Low Impact (20 minutes).  This workout comes from the Timesaver Cardio Fat Burner video.  Kathy uses mostly basic steps--eg, v-step, knee lift, hamstring curls, grapevines, etc.--but the choreography becomes a bit more complicated as the segment continues, and Kathy frequently takes it from the top.  However, the moves are fun, and it's a high-energy workout.

2) Long Slow 2, Kickboxing (15 minutes).  This segment is taken from the first half of Kathy's Kickboxing Workout.  She leads simple drills using the jab and cross punches plus front and side kicks.  Some jump kicks are included, and there's also an easy combination towards the end.

3) Interval 1, Functional Fitness (20 minutes).  This workout comes from Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning, and it alternates two minute high intensity intervals with lower intensity recovery periods.  During the latter, you get in a bit of lower body strengthening with moves such as squats and lunges.  Overall, this program is more athletic-like, less fun.

4) Interval 2, Jump Rope (17 minutes).  This segment comes from Aerobox, a video Kathy did with boxer Michael Olijade, who leads the workout.  Michael takes you through progressively more difficult jump rope variations; one of the background exercisers follows along without the jump rope.  Simple boxing punches/footwork segments come in-between the jumping segments.

5) Weights, Upper Body (20 minutes).  This segment comes from Timersaver Lift Weights to Lose Weight.  Here Kathy uses a dual track system which allows you to lift lighter with more repetitions or lift heavier with breaks between sets.  Kathy begins with back work, moves on to chest, biceps, tricpes, and finally shoulders.

6) Weights, Lower Body (20 minutes).  This segment is also from Timesaver Lift Weights to Lose Weight.  Most of the exercises are performed in a standing position (squats, lunges, side/front extensions, etc.) to work your legs, but it also includes some lying hamstring/glute work using a chair.

Overall, this is a very versatile DVD providing a variety of workout options.  However, there are a few minor flaws:  1) there are no warm-ups or cool-downs, so you'll have do some light cardio before as well as some stretching after, and 2) there is no abs work--the 7-minute abs segment from Lift Weights to Lose Weights is excellent, and it's a shame it wasn't included here.  Otherwise, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DVD for advanced beginner to intermediate exercisers.",1131580800,37,3073,5.186991869918699
7971745,4,B00006LPBW,"If I were to recommend any DVD to someone just starting out exercising, it would be this one.  Kathy Smith doesn't just give you cardio workouts, high intensity workouts, or weight lifting.  She gives you two sessions of each, allowing you to build your week.  I have used this DVD five days a week for six months, and still find it effective.  I like that I have the choice to pick and choose, and yet I also have the structure of something I am familiar with.  I will agree with the other reviewers that the cardio workout is hard to learn at first, that the warm-ups are missing, and that there is no section that works out your abs.  But you can easily overcome these flaws (take a little time to learn the routine, warm up yourself, and substitute your own ab workout).  Rarely do you find such a good mix of workouts on one DVD.  It's worth every cent.",1130976000,12,858,4.31875
7971746,5,B00006LPBW,"I love this exercise DVD. I owned a few other exercise DVDs, but this one, The Rules of Fat Burning, is the one that I always come back to. I had this DVD for about over one year and I am still using it. Over the time, using the DVD shapes my body and also keep me interested.",1118448000,4,276,3.7758620689655173
