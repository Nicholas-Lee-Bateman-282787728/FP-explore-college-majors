8431150,5,B004ISVGYO,"I have been a big fan of David's for a only a few years now (I wish I could say for much longer).  His music speaks to my soul on a level I never thought possible.  I was exceptionally pleased when I opened the packaging.  I was not aware that what I was going to receive was this really nice booklet with pictures from the show and a very personal note from David on his experience on a cold day in N.Y.C.  This DVD includes some of my favorite songs.  David Gray is amazing and his music is very thought provoking.  Every nuance of every song is thought out so meticulously (in a good way).  From beginning to end, flawless.",1301529600,12,626,4.166666666666667
