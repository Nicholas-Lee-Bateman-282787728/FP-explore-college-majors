7905792,4,B00000AEQ3,"This is no Prefontaine movie.  Ryun didn't have the charisma nor cockiness of Prefontaine, but he was a much better runner.  There are not going to be any Hollywood movies written about him, so this will probably be your only  chance to see what a great runner he was on video.  This is a good movie  for those serious runners, more racing and less drama.",950313600,18,355,4.4
