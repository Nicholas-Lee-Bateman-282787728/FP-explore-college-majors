7906007,1,B00000F0BX,"County Galway, Eire, is a striking substitute for Maine in this virtually incomprehensible Roger Corman produced film that would have more perceptibly profited from substitutions for the script and from among the cast and crew, although even a complete overhaul of the production would possibly yet find the work lacking in the matter of viewer gratification.  An attorney, John Burnside (Robert Carradine), disembarks from a small commercial aircraft at a semi-rural Maine location where he by chance picks up luggage belonging to another passenger, Stella Crosby (Rebecca Staab), who then invites him to the home of her and her absent (for the entire picture) spouse Tom, at which a party is being held during the evening of the same day.  Burnside is lured from the residence and abducted by thugs who obviously have assumed that ill-starred John is in fact Tom Crosby, the latter along with Stella owing the kidnappers two million dollars from shared money laundering activity that has plainly eschewed any aspect of honour among thieves.  By dint of less than plausible derring-do, Burnside evades his bent-upon-torture abductors, and makes his way back to the Crosby house, where he endeavours through a wan attempt at intimidation, to discover from a vixenish Stella an explanation to account for his recent misadventure; however, she instead takes him to her bed, disappearing the next day, only to soon reappear, and then again disappear, and so forth, all while the frustrated mentioned ruffians flounder about in search of her and her perplexed lover.  As might be expected, Carradine makes for a weightless and generally torpid hero, seemingly incapable of ditching his native penchant for mumbling his lines.  Top-billed Fred Dryer, meanwhile, barely is seen, and we are not advised as to what might be his function within the storyline.  Nonetheless, the film contains effective moments, although connections between scenes are consistently absent.  A viewer will approve of the inventive camerawork by Jules LaBarthe, so creative that the beginning pages of the film are absorbing because of it.  However, turning the coin, sound reproduction is substandard throughout, a good deal of dialogue being but faintly heard as a consequence, with an overly loud score by Arthur Kempel, arresting in itself, often simply drowning out voices.  Playing by a largely Irish based supporting cast is uneven in quality, although never lacking in effort.  The most troublesome aspect of the piece stems from a script wherein motivation, indeed the very actions of the characters, have no sense to them at all, especially evident through the role of Burnside, who seems, as interpreted by Carradine, to be imbued with embryonic imbecility.",1188950400,,2739,5.275862068965517
7906008,2,B00000F0BX,"I bought this stinker solely because Rebecca Staab stars in it; but even this unheralded actress's presence isn't enough to raise it to mediocrity. The problems are numerous: It's supposed to take place in Maine (I think, maybe it's Canada, who knows?) but most of the characters speak with Irish accents, there are Norman castles, an Aer Lingus puddle jumper, and the police are wearing foreign looking uniforms. Sure enough, it was filmed entirely in Ireland. Fred Dryer is given lead billing yet is on screen for all of 2-3 minutes. The character played by Robert Carradine is supposed to be a lawyer, yet acts like someone who'd have trouble making it to a soup line. Not that Carradine's a bad actor, it's just that his part was written so stupidly. Staab plays a convincing femme fatale who seduces Carradine into being her patsy. Or is she the one being set up? We must suffer through to the end, and the obligatory Corman grand massacre, to learn the answer to that one. Surprisingly, the film was quite credibly acted, but good acting can not compensate for poor writing...and a bewildering plot. One could go on a long time faulting this film but time is money; and except for finally seeing Staab in a starring role, I wish I could get back the 86 minutes I wasted on Stray Bullet.",1005523200,,1292,4.646288209606987
