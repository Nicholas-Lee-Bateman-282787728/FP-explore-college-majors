8349635,3,B0022LL41O,The picture wasn't the greatest but you could see whats happening and even though this was a gift for my dad I enjoyed watching this movie then falling asleep.,1512000000,,159,4.517241379310345
8349636,3,B0022LL41O,"Bought it because of Spike Jones.  He is the best of this movie.  Bad transfer.  Very grainy.  Looked like it was taken from old 16mm print.  But I bought it for the City Slickers, and they never disappoint.  Thanks!",1463875200,3,216,4.410256410256411
8349637,1,B0022LL41O,Super Bad copy.  Some scenes were so dark you could barely make out what was going on.  Total waste of money.,1428624000,2,109,4.142857142857143
8349638,4,B0022LL41O,"An hilarious movie worth having but an exceptionally poor transfer.  I can abide scratches and artifacts but the contrast was terrible, making for a dark, dim viewing and there is NO excuse for not cleaning the film gate!",1425340800,3,221,4.815789473684211
8349639,1,B0022LL41O,"This hard-to-find movie has not been re-mastered or even remotely ""cleaned up"" in any way. The picture is very often cloudd, dark and difficult to view. Save your money until a better version is released. Also, Hugh O'Brian and Buddy Hackett are absolutely NO substitute for Bud Abbott and Lou Costello who were originally slated for the lead roles.",1420502400,2,349,4.932203389830509
8349640,1,B0022LL41O,"I've searched for this movie for a decade (VHS or DVD).

Finally found the one shown here but far LESS than the seller's INSANE price.

Unfortunately, the Quality of the disk is worse than most disk copies of various EARLY, Black & White TV episodes!

I'm 82 - hoping to live long enough to find a decent copy!",1299110400,4,310,4.310344827586207
8349641,1,B0022LL41O,"This film is unspeakably bad.  No wonder Lou Costello became sick and was replaced.  The script is terrible, the filming is lousy, the quality of the picture on DVD is at best mediocre, and there are no laughs for anyone over, say, 12.  And I'm a Spike Jones fan!",1254441600,4,263,4.326530612244898
8349642,3,B0022LL41O,I have tried for years to get a copy of this movie and as soon as I saw it was available I just had to have it. It is only a light comedy but it is worth having if only for the antics of Spike Jones and his City Slickers. Well worth waiting for.,1243641600,4,245,3.5555555555555554
