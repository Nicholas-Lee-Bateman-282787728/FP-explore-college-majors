8486377,3,B005TLPNHA,"This is a very low budget production that expresses the producer's passion for  aquaponics but does not really tell you much about getting into this fascinating agricultural concept. If you really want to learn how to get into aquaponics, I recommend you check out some books available through Mother Earth News. In the meantime, I don't think this video is worth the $1 they charge to watch it. However, they credited the $1 to my music account and I was able to buy a song...so in a complicated kind of way the video was free to watch. That's why I gave it a 3 instead of a 1.",1360454400,2,578,4.351851851851852

8486379,1,B005TLPNHA,the picture quality of the video was sufficient. the explanations and discriptions were overly simplified. it made me feel childish. he made mention of some items availible on their website with no mention of the web address. i don't feel like this item was at all worth the 17.95 i paid for it. this is the only item i've purchased from amazon that i haven't been satisfied with.,1321056000,7,380,4.602941176470588
