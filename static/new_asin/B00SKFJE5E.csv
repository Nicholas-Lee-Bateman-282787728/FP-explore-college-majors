8698754,4,B00SKFJE5E,"I couldn't disagree more with the previous review.  This DVD finds Shuggie in fine form with a solid band, much like his father's.  Shuggie is one of the more underrated guitarists out there, and that is well demonstrated through this solid performance.  I always felt that his guitar work was the most compelling element of the Johnny Otis Show.  This concert proves Shuggie picked up right where he left off years ago.  Welcome back, Shuggie!",1455062400,,444,4.866666666666666
