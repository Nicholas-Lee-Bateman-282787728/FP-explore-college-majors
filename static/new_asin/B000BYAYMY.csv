2446167,5,B000BYAYMY,"This DVD documents the brutal Axe murders of an Ohio couple and their four children, as well as two other young girls who tragically had been visiting the night of the brutal attack.

Taking place in Midwest Ohio in 1912, the film chronicles the unrest created amoungst the town's residents who split right down the middle based on their economic status and even Church domininations as to who they believed committed this slaughter of innocent human beings.

The extra feature commentary by the Rundles who produced this film is excellent and offers a very down to earth study of dealing with a small community who to this day still has difficulty in dealing with this brutal and tragic crime.

For Crime buffs, as well as American Anthropoligists it well worth the viewing and excellently chronicled with interviews, photos, reinactments, and even criminal profiles by former FBI crime investigators.

Was this crime perpetrated by one of America's first serial murderers?

The answer the film offers is YES.......and his bloody story of murder across the Midwest during two years makes him a likely candidate.",1209427200,2,1112,5.087912087912088
2446168,2,B000BYAYMY,"In 1912, the small, bucolic and seemingly idyllic town of Villisca, Iowa, was the setting for one of most horrendous and shocking slaughters in the blood red annals of American crimimal history - eight people, a husband, Joe Moore, and his wife, their four children and two of the children's young playmates were butchered beyong recognition in the Moore home while they slept. The weapon, an ax, was leaning casually against the wall, a chimney-less oil lamp placed near by, creating an eerie, almost inhuman tableau. Another oil lamp would be found at the foot of one of the victims' beds. The windows of the house had the shades drawn and pulled; other windows were covered by torn skirts, even the mirrors were draped, as if the murderer or murderers couldn't stand to catch even a glimpse of themselves nor their heinous actions, but most curious of all was the rasher of bacon left on the floor by another bloody bed. The quiet confidence of Villisca was shattered that day, the once hospitable folks now locking those screendoors and began carrying guns and living en masse, just waiting, praying, hoping for the killer to be caught, but he never was, and Villisca was never the same again. This documentary is an in-depth examination of this nearly century-old crime. Well-made, it is obviously a labour of love for the writer/director team, but the film also required the services of a sharp-eyed editor. At almost two hours, it is far too long, with choronology oftentimes jumpy and illogical. At its best, it's fascinating, especially when it comes to the amount of remembrances, sometmes frightening, touching and humorous,of soon-to-be-deceased old-timers. At its worst, the crime and the victims themselves take a backseat very early on. We learn pratically nothing about Mr. Moore and his family, and we feel nothing for them as the result. In 116 minutes (plus well-deserved excised ""bonus"" footage) we are not even afforded a single scanning shot of the victims' graves. Were the two of the Moore's children's friends buried with them or separately? Suspects abound - a U.S. Senator, his none-too-bright son, a daffy mad hatter of a visiting preacherman, a possibly hired thug nicknamed ""Blackie"" - there's even a suspicious private detective, not to mention an entire community that all at once clammed up, to protect the innocent or the guilty?, who went on spying on neighbours through blinds and knotholes - a town divided. But nothing is elaborated upon when it comes to the things we really want to know, too many questions raised and left unanswered. Also it seems the mid-west back then was a happy hunting ground for a possible serial killer, his weapon of choice, guess what?, an ax, and it seems he carved up at least a dozen of God's children before turning the blade on his wife and family and was finally sent off to prison and low and behold all the chopping ceased! But this suspect is dealt with in a mere few minutes (even though he seems the most likely candidate). No motives are put forth for the crimes, with the exception of the old standards - business competition and adultery (the senator's son's wife's bedroom had a revolving door, one of her extracurricular activities being the tall, dark and handsome Joe Moore - or so says gossip). The film presents no facts, only hearsay. Was it a crime of hate like Lizzie Borden? The ax deliberately chosen to obliterate Moore's visage from the face of the earth? Was Moore even the intended victim? Who knows? The film doesn't offer any explanations, or even conjecture. Frankly, this unsolved case needs the unjaundiced and critical eye of a good investigatory author, or the pen of a master of pschological horror like Ruth Rendell. All in all, for atmosphere watch the ten minute segment on the crime from the show ""World's Scariest Places"" and for better, simple and more straightforward facts, visit the ""official"" website. Of course the place is now a tourist trap, akin to the Lizzie Borden Bed & Breakfast in Fall River, MA. Sad - the whole thing, the murders, the lack of an arrest, the lack of a good retelling and examination of the case. But what's the saddest of all was the slow death of Villisca itself, famous now for something it would probably rather forget and leave dead and buried. We'll have to wait evidently for there to be a good, concise re-evaluation, but unfortunately, this isn't it. Oh, and one last thing...listen closely near the end and you wouldn't believe the possible significance of that bacon!",1195430400,6,4518,4.853626943005182
2446169,5,B000BYAYMY,"Outstanding filmmaking -- Villisca: Living with a Mystery gives us an intelligent, accurate and unbiased account of facts and details that led to turn-of-the-century axe murders, still unsolved after almost 100 years.  Thoughtful and visually masterful, Kelly and Tammy Rundle have chronicled the horrific events of that single night and how those murders continue to impact a small mid-western town today. With expert and credible research, the Rundles give us a thoroughly engaging documentary without sensationalism, details that inform not exploit to tell the story of how a town was forever changed, overnight.",1170720000,,615,5.612903225806452
2446170,5,B000BYAYMY,"What a wonderful piece of work!  A documentary that is at once informative, intriguing and terrifying - a ""horror flick"" not due to gruesome special effects and jolting surprises, but rather to the grisly reality that demented acts do occur, and they shape us profoundly from our personal psychologies to our communal attitudes.

Having spent my life on the West Coast, I'd never heard of this town or the murder, so I came to the film knowing only that it was ""about an axe murder.""  It is so much more.  Yes, the historical mystery is presented, clearly and fascinatingly.  But it goes on to build the psychology and personality of the town itself, as shaped by the murder and its aftermath.

This was a small town in the early 1900s - murder was personal and close and horrifying, there was no way for the townspeople to shrug it off as we might now that we've become more accustomed to, and desensitized to, violent crime.  The town changed overnight, from welcoming and warm and trusting, to fearful, prejudiced and defensive.  A community that had gone along in harmony became split, with half believing these had been murders for political/financial/community gain and the other half believing it was merely the work of a madman.  One belief generated battles and hard feelings within the community, splitting families and friends to opposite sides and lifelong feuds.  The other created a fearful, racist, closed society, completely distrustful and rejecting of any stranger or person of color.  The town remains split even over the reality of this piece of its history - those who believe it to be historical fact which should be remembered are accused of celebrating it by those who consider it a shame that should be hidden and forgotten.

The documentary presents it all in a fair and non-partisan manner.  No sides are taken, so we viewers get the full story and can develop our own conclusions - we are still, after seeing the film, in exactly the same position as the town and the authorities, ""living with a mystery"" - we have all the information at hand, but still no positive conclusions.

Artistically, this is a documentary with a twist...the narration is so calm and cool and presentational, that it eventually creates a chilling and horrific atmosphere.  In our modern world we are so familiar with murder, and so surrounded by excitement and sensationalism, that this calm matter-of-fact voice talking of bashed heads and sundown laws becomes spine-shivering, and we are reminded of the true horror of some things we've begun to accept as common in our modern world.",1134691200,20,2589,4.892448512585812
2446171,5,B000BYAYMY,"I didn't know much about the mysterious, unsolved murders of Villisca before viewing this unique documentary.  The producers have nearly unraveled the mystery decades later...or did they? It truly is a great mystery for the ages.  What a great story! Told with just the right amount of Midwestern flavor of the era and with intriguing images and interviews, this will leave you on the edge of your seat. Bravo!",1134518400,9,410,4.927536231884058
2446172,5,B000BYAYMY,"I've been following this film's progress since I first read about it in June of 2002. I got a chance to see it in October 2004 and I was not disappointed. It's really a wonderful film. From the first time I read about the tragedy until I saw the documentary, I was struck with the care that the filmmakers took to remain both faithful to the story and respectful of the people of Villisca, Iowa. Their aim was to try to understand, not exploit, the horrible atrocity that occurred in the once peaceful town nearly 100 years ago. There are many twists and turns and various characters involved and each is depicted in the film in such a way that makes it very easy to understand and follow the story. It's astounding that the deep wound that was inflicted upon Villisca in 1912 is still felt as sharply today. I was also very impressed with the historian, Dr. Epperly, who has diligently been researching this crime for 50 years now! Thank God he and the Rundles found each other and could work together to bring the story to light of what happened in Villisca so long ago.

After viewing the film again on DVD exactly one year after seeing it in the theatre, my opinion of it hasn't changed. If anything, I think it's better the second time around. Anyone who has the slightest interest in unresolved cases such as this should purchase the DVD. I promise you will not be disappointed.

A very well done documentary and I highly recommend it!",1131321600,14,1441,4.4961832061068705
2446173,5,B000BYAYMY,"This film is a documentary focusing on the June 1912 Villisca, Iowa axe murders that killed eight people. The movie tells the story of the crime itself, the suspects, the attempts at solving the crime and the lasting effects this heinous act had on the small town of Villisca. Townspeople, criminal experts and Villisca ""buffs"" are interviewed. Suspects are presented and theories given, but the mystery goes on....

An enjoyable movie for crime buffs and historians - very well presented. You don't have to know about the crime in advance to understand and enjoy the movie. Since it is a documentary, it is full of still photos, but nothing squeamish like the subject might suggest.

The DVD is chock full of goodies, including two sets of commentaries, one by Dr. Ed Epperly, Villisca crime expert, who has been researching the case for 50 years, and another by the filmmakers themselves.  Great stuff",1131062400,5,903,4.927631578947368

2446175,5,B000BYAYMY,"A facinating saga or 19th century true crime.  unsolved true crime.  Rundle's account transcribed into a video is as mystifying as the novel by Troy Taylor.  I loved both and wish more clues could have been followed by the Villisca, Iowa police of the day. Instead, even worse than the Borden Case of Fall River, MA, it was a circus in that little house that morning.  There was more time spent trying to take pictures of the butchered ax-violated bodies of the victims. Or grandstanding 'my sorrow' by the local polictians and clergy.  Nicely done.  Worth the price of admission,",1406419200,,580,4.75

2446177,3,B000BYAYMY,"Background of the town Villisca throughout the years interspersed with bits about the axe murder. When they came back to talking about the murder I had some trouble remembering who was who back in 1912. No concrete example was given as to why the Reverend George Kelly was referred to as nuts, crazy, mentally ill and mentally unstable (merely because he wanted kids out of the house because he wanted to ""walk the floor?"").  Later in the film info is given that he was a Peeping Tom, but that doesn't necessarily mean a person is crazy.  That the authorities believed him when he said he had worked for Scotland Yard and let him in the house just showed that they were not terribly bright. There also really wasn't any proof of Albert Jones being stupid, except that his wife cheated on him, although later love letters from another woman to Albert Jones were found by a woman (this was talked about in one of the extra chapters) and ""Bob"" (whoever that was) told her to burn them, so she of course she did what Bob told her to do. People of Villisca did not care to have their town talked about for the murder...probably because of how some of the townspeople reacted after the murder. Many were nosy, some were opportunistic, some were liars, and some were trying to make trouble for others in order to profit for themselves. Current day Villisca: they wear HUGE pink pig face hats and march in a parade.

I thought it was interesting that according to a lady who lived in the house (as a child) 24 years after the murder, the bloodstains were still on the wallpaper.

I could not see why anyone in the town, including the ""crazy"" minister, would have a motive to kill six children and two adults.  Probably the filmmakers (or whoever decided this) are correct in their supposition of who committed the murder. I take with a grain of salt that everyone locked their front door, but of course not the back door. That didn't make much sense.",1378339200,,1942,4.537142857142857
2446178,2,B000BYAYMY,"This documentary was so boring I felt like I was getting a history lesson in school.  I was very disappointed, as there are many, many exciting, interesting and valid parts of this story that were completely left out.",1377129600,,217,4.7105263157894735
2446179,5,B000BYAYMY,"This is an enthralling, all-around recounting of the Villisca axe murders and the circumstances surrounding the case thereafter.  The town is compellingly depicted.",1368662400,,164,6.130434782608695
2446180,5,B000BYAYMY,"This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.

Villisca was a Thornton Wilder ""Our Town"" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.

It's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.

A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.

The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.

These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. ""Villisca"" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.

There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels.",1366502400,3,2884,5.175965665236052

8094130,4,B000BYAYMY,"This is a very well-done documentary about the murders that rocked Villisca, IA in 1912 and their aftermath. It is not lurid but tastefully done and treats the subject of the Moore/Stillinger murders with respect. More than that; it is a portrait of a small town forever changed by and forced to deal with a tragedy that no one could have been prepared for.
The controversial aftermath of the murders is examined and the ramifications for Villisca are discussed. Both are handled in a straight forward fashion by the filmmakers who simply state the facts and allow the townspeople to speak their minds. Some acknowledge the murders should be discussed as part of the town's history; others suggest they're better off forgotten. Both sides get equal play here.
I'd like to add that, for me, the soundtrack to this was haunting and has really stuck with me after the first viewing of the documentary. They scored big there!",1515801600,,921,4.8354430379746836
