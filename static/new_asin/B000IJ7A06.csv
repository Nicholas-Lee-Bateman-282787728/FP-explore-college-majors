2657888,2,B000IJ7A06,"The first reviewer nailed the problem with the DVD. The two instructors are like night and day. CJ is awful. I found her style grating and robotic. My children(3 and 5) really enjoyed doing the Tai Chi with David's instruction, but burst into tears when they heard CJ. They kept pleading with me to, ""Turn the mean lady off"". I will have to return this disk :(",1180656000,9,360,4.388059701492537
2657889,3,B000IJ7A06,"David performs the A.M. routine.  It is great.  He is a great speaker. He moves and flows well.
CJ McPhee performs the P.M. routine.  Her speaking was loud and robotic. No rhythm. Distracting.  Lighting was poor due to p.m. shooting time.
David should have done all the routines.",1179273600,9,279,4.75

2657892,5,B000IJ7A06,"I have been doing the A.M. Chi with David-Dorian for well over a year now ( anywhere from 1X to 7X per week) and love it.  I found the more traditional froms of T'ai Chi kind of boring (sorry to say that so bluntly).  The A.M. takes about 20 minutes and didn't take long to learn; lovely beach setting.  Mixes in nicely with a bodybuilding-type workout with weights or a little yoga here and there; I think it has helped me improve my health energetically.  The P.M. is less entertaining to perform and the voice-over for the P.M. is not as pleasant.  I love the way D-D Ross modernizes T'ai Chi movement, and would love more from David-Dorian Ross if I could find it.",1447200000,2,668,4.354838709677419
2657893,5,B000IJ7A06,"I just love it! I've been playing this DVD over the years. What  I didn't like it is that I was charged as for a new product, and I ordered and received a used one, I protest, but I keep it, I am traveling and it is just great to play it on my laptop, it is so energizing and restful at the same time it is a long life love story with this peaceful warrior, graceful movements.",1439856000,,377,3.8333333333333335

I have have found it improves my flexibility, and helps me grow in being mindful in general and having body awareness in particular.  Very pleasant, very doable.  The AM Chi spoken instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  The PM Chi instructions are not as clear, but still with practice it works.",1439078400,,376,4.567164179104478

2657900,5,B000IJ7A06,"On a scale of 1 to 5  I give this a 10.
I have done the weight training Linda Hamilton did for Terminator 2.
I have studied ballet.
And I have found the A.M. and P.M. Tai Chi exercise to be the most satisfying (dread free) workout of all time.
Plus, I don't need any additional equipment or ballet bar all you need is yourself, a few sq. feet and something to view it on.
 If you are looking for the beautifully choreographed Tai Chi this isn't it.
A great beginners version of that can be found in Tai Chi beginning practice also with David-Dorian Ross

Dont kid yourself when this is done as David and CJ do it you will have a workout.
They are easy to follow.
Remember to keep, knees bent, tailbone tucked down.
Work at mimicking their movements and postures exactly, some things are very subtle, so watch closely.
Work slowly towards doing as they do.
Be patient.
Even if I am burdened w/stress somehow the exercises wash that away.
This is relaxing and stimulating at the same time leaving one w/a healthy feeling.
It is a 'total feel good workout'..
I highly recommend it.

Originally I had it on VHS, but when my video player died and I got a dvd player, I searched for a long time to find this on dvd.  I'm delighted that Gaiam has finally converted it to dvd.  I am 66 years old and I do these exercises every morning and evening.  It is gentle, feels good and is easy to do.  The added benefit is it helps me concentrate on my breathing which is relaxing and focuses me""in the moment.'  David Dorian Ross and C.J. McPhee give easy to follow instructions.  The segments were each filmed on the beach in Mauai and the setting is beautiful and serene and the music is peaceful and calming.

2657915,4,B000IJ7A06,"I like the style of this video, as the presenters seek to connect the actions with a larger life-philosophy.  The instructions are clear, the timing is good, the setting is beautiful.  I ordered another product produced by a martial arts practitioner.  That instructor gave every impression that she was most concerned with technique in the way her other, bone-breaking proficiency required.  There was no consideration of the traditions out of which the practice grows.  This video opens a doorway to a whole-life encounter with T'ai Chi.",1372809600,2,539,5.22093023255814

2657918,5,B000IJ7A06,"This DVD has two workouts:  AM Chi and PM Chi.  You can start your day with energy chi and end your day with calming chi.

AM Chi (with David Dorian-Ross)

What a wonderful way to start your day, looking out over a Hawaiian beach and gently working your body.  I can really feel myself coming alive.

I love David Dorian-Ross as an instructor and find it very easy to follow along with the movements.  The eight pieces of brocade is a particularly stimulating series.

I highly recommend this workout for anyone wanting to gently awaken their body and start the day full of light and energy.

PM Chi (with CJ McPhee)

A beautiful sunset on a Hawaiian beach, soothing voice and relaxing music will set the tone for a good night's sleep.  Add in gentle circular movements, water and the moon and you'll sleep like a baby.

My favorite move is ""Master Wong sweeps the water.""  What a cool name for a move.  I can really visualize myself standing in a warm pool or water and gently moving my hands back and forth.  I practically fall asleep right then and there.  And this is coming from a super-hyper person who can't sit still for an instant.

I highly recommend this practice as a wonderful way to unwind from the day.",1366329600,4,1217,4.459090909090909
2657919,4,B000IJ7A06,"The AM Chi is terrific.  Gets your juices flowing for the day.  The PM Chi has gotten a bad rap from some people but the actual program is very relaxing.  Totally different from AM one.  Helps with balance and flexibility.  Yes, CJ yells in the introduction and she's a little scary.  But,  give it a chance. The VoiceOver in the PM Chi is softer.  Yes, D-D Ross is better but we don't live in a perfect world.  I am just a beginner both programs are easy to follow and learn. I'm close to doing the AM one without the video.  Soon I'll be able to do it in the park!  Thanks",1365206400,,574,4.081081081081081
2657920,4,B000IJ7A06,I am still in the learning stages so I'll continue to practice until I am proficient in this art.  I think this DVD is for people who already have a knowledge of T'ai Chi.,1365033600,,171,4.029411764705882
2657921,5,B000IJ7A06,I am enjoying doing both these routines.  I live in an apartment and don't get around to doing the AM routine until later in the day because doing it in the early morning might disturb the neighbors below me.  I feel re-vitalized after I did the routine.  I did the PM routine and enjoyed that too.  I felt both relaxed and energetic at the same time after doing it.  The interviews with the two teachers were interesting.,1362268800,,422,4.428571428571429
2657922,5,B000IJ7A06,"I don't like David-Dorian Ross' Tai Chi for Health and Happiness, but I do love this one. I have been working out with this once a week. If I have more time, I would like to increase to do it everyday. It is reasonable considering the time that take and the difficulty the movements are.

I found the A.M. chi to be sort of hokey but the P.M. to be quite soothing.  Not disrespecting DDR:  I know he is very good at what he does, I just didn't like this particular routine.",1326412800,,312,3.828125

2657927,5,B000IJ7A06,"I have been using this, day and night, for over a year; what a great instructional set!!  Very pleased!  I have taken both t'ai chi and qi gong from masters in the past; these are easy enough exercises for out-of-shape  seniors like myself, at just the right length.
  First off....yeahyeahyeah; it's not really t'ai chi, it's qi gong (both instructors, in their interviews, tend to use the terms interchangeably). if you consider qi gong to be discrete exercises--that is, do one movement, stop, now do another, stop, do another...; whereas t'ai chi blends the movements together into a dance (martial artists would call it a ""kata"").  In the East, things are not so dicotomous, so clear-cut as in Western thought; there is some overlap between the two terms, many thinking t'ai chi is a small part of qi gong wisdom....and the term t'ai chi is much more well-known in the U.S.A., and would sell more.....so what?  What a great set of chi-building exercises!!
  Also, Ms. McPhee is not at all robotic or grating; she's very soothing and seems to move more slowly than DD Ross. You can get it all---understand everything necessary to do the exercises--if you pay attention (isn't that the way life is?). Strangely, she's just an ordinary-looking lady, but once she gets started in her chi workout, and gets wrapped up in her alpha or delta state, she's incredibly beautiful!!  In my humble opinion...
  Worthwhile study!",1320537600,16,1420,4.895397489539749
2657928,2,B000IJ7A06,"I had a wonderful VCR workout from David-Dorian Ross with this same title.  I don't have a VCR anymore and I've purchased two DVDs since that time thinking I was getting the same workout as my original.  This DVD is extremely mild and not what I was looking for. I probably won't even use it.  Its probably great for someone looking for a few minutes of calming movements but the original one had arm movements, lots of twists and balance movements as well.  When I was finished with that Tai Chi exercise, I was really energized and ready for the day.",1319068800,,552,4.435643564356436
2657929,5,B000IJ7A06,My husband and I decided to try Tai Chi.  This was the first DVD we purchased and we have enjoyed the workouts.  We like the step by step instructions and the background is absolutely beautiful.,1317081600,6,194,4.514285714285714
2657930,5,B000IJ7A06,"It's not t'ai chi, folks. It's qigong. The ""title"" and graphics on the DVD cover are misleading, but the qigong practices in these two videos are really great. I only wish they had focused more on the visualizations that accompany the breathing meditations that comprise the qigong movements. Still, very good.",1299369600,5,310,5.098039215686274
2657931,3,B000IJ7A06,"I wish they had been more forthcoming with what is actually on this DVD that amounted to the total number of minutes advertised. There are basically 2 short routines, with about 5 minutes of blather at the beginning of each. The other length of time seems to go toward an interview with one or the other of these people. Why exactly do I want to see an interview with either of them, I don't know? And, there's a plinky-plunky ""relaxation"" CD included. If that kind of a-rhythmic stuff doesn't drive you crazy, then I guess that's a nice bonus. From my tone, you can tell how well this practice is working for me....",1296950400,2,616,4.460176991150442
2657932,3,B000IJ7A06,"The AM session is well demonstrated. DDR does it mirror image and it is easy to follow. It is well suited for seniors.
The PM session is hampered by its more ""arty"" production at the expense of clearly viewing the movements",1294185600,3,223,4.463414634146342
2657933,4,B000IJ7A06,"I bought this DVD a little over a year ago.  I have fibromyalgia and am pretty much in constant pain.  My doctors recommended Tai Chi and yoga to help manage the pain and increase mobility.  I tried yoga, but it is not really my ""thing"".  So, on to Tai Chi.  Wow!  This is where I belong!
I love how the DVD is divided into AM and PM practices.  The AM is for first thing in the morning, to refresh stagnant Chi.  Dorian Ross is wonderful with guided imagery and the exercises really open up the major muscle groups, and allows the flow of Chi.  I do find that my shoulders, hips, and neck really respond to this exercise, which is at times both relaxing and challenging.
There is also an intro by David Dorian Ross, where he explains the basics of Tai Chi or Xi Gong, and his approach.  On my DVD player, you can choose not to view this, but I would recommend watching it at least once.
I really also like the PM Chi, which is designed to practice just before bed.  It helps me unwind after a stressful day.  I find I sleep better and have less aches during the night.  Carolyn McPhee also has a good use of guided imagery, ""imagine moving rose petals back and forth through warm water"".
I am kind of surprised that some reviewers hate McPhee, and to a lesser extent, Dorian Ross.  Actually, the only reason I'm giving this review 4 Stars instead of 5 is that both my husband and exchange student really dislike the PM Chi practice.  My husband didn't like the sentiments, for example ""drinking in the moon,"" etc.  Our exchange student actually found parts silly.  Personally, I really relate to both AM and PM practices.  Again, there is an interview with Carolyn McPhee that I feel is helpful in understanding Tai Chi, and how McPhee became involved in it.",1290124800,44,1759,4.409937888198757

2657935,4,B000IJ7A06,"I got this DVD last Christmas and I have to admit base on my knowledge (slightly above novice) of Chinese ""healing arts"" this DVD should be referred to as AM and PM qigong.  No form of t'ai chi is actually taught.  This is unfortunate as someone who is looking for an introduction to basic qigong movements wold benefit from this DVD, but would probably not find it when they search under that subject.

I stumbled across the practice by accident when a small bit of it was included in an exercise video I was using and, because I liked the relaxed feeling I encountered, I'm beginning to explore it a little further through more videos. With regard to AM and PM Tai Chi, I disagree with the reviewers who said that CJ McPhee was grating, loud, robotic or scary in the PM Chi.  I found her voice soothing and enjoyed her beautiful descriptions of the movements.  I found PM Chi relaxing and will continue to use it.  I can't say that I felt the same way about AM Chi. Perhaps it is just a case of personal preference, but I did not enjoy David Dorian Ross' teaching style and can't imagine that I will revisit that portion of the DVD.",1194048000,34,826,4.24203821656051
