6508695,2,B00LWG6W2Q,A show I've given quite a bit if wiggle room in the entertaining department is losing steam.,1410307200,2,92,4.470588235294118

6508702,3,B00LWG6W2Q,Came on quick as described but these are burned discs.  I hope they bought the rights. Or I should definitely get a discount.,1476748800,,125,4.434782608695652
6508703,3,B00LWG6W2Q,Fascinating in the way that a train wreck is fascinating or a visit with aliens.,1472774400,,80,4.4
6508704,5,B00LWG6W2Q,I absolutely love this season! I guess that is obvious because I paid for the series instead of waiting a few months to watch it for free. I find that this series has so much valuable information from the most nutritious plant to how to build a faraday cage. This information is invaluable and I truly wish that the season was longer so that I could learn more but it is still great and they have one really hooked viewer here.,1464566400,,427,4.283950617283951

6508709,5,B00LWG6W2Q,Love it. I've got all 4 seasons now. I recommend watching the colony from the Discovery channel.,1454112000,,96,4.705882352941177
6508710,5,B00LWG6W2Q,You can purchase these 6 episodes from Amazon Video for $9.99 SD or $15.99 HD - all are good quality.  These episodes are the best in the entire series; much more serious preppers.,1453766400,,180,4.454545454545454
6508711,5,B00LWG6W2Q,love this show but missing an episode that was suppoese to come with it. Amazon decided not to allow it but did not give any disclaimer I wouldnt be getting ALL I paid for,1442448000,,171,4.0588235294117645

6508713,3,B00LWG6W2Q,No menu on the DVD?  Only a handful of episodes?  I'm feeling pretty generous today giving it 3 stars,1438214400,,101,4.2631578947368425
6508714,5,B00LWG6W2Q,Love it,1437436800,,7,3.0
6508715,5,B00LWG6W2Q,"Highly creative people willing to share their best ideas, actions and preps in face of future terrible scenarios for benefits of others and to help improve their preps themselves.  Perhaps a little heavy on the dramatizations for Realty TV sake but the underlying questions they pose are still germane and often educational.",1433376000,,324,5.230769230769231
6508716,4,B00LWG6W2Q,"I really like doomsday preppers in general. The first season was really good. The fourth season was just as good as first season. Other two seasons where ok. Sad that Nat geo cancelled. The series is very education for learning to prep. Not a complete guide to prepping but a general overview. Everyone should be prepped in moderation. However, that being said some of the people on this series are really crazy. But overall great documentary.",1432944000,,443,4.842105263157895
6508717,5,B00LWG6W2Q,"Knowledge is the tool for any situation and the more you learn , one can put into practice and become more skilled in whatever one does.
This show is becoming more and more popular here in Australia and its affect is waking up a lot of peoples minds to be better prepared to
the same types of situations , such as floods , bushfires even tornadoes and cyclones. That happen all over the world. I'am a firm believer that these skills should be part of every ones daily education.",1431820800,,478,4.382022471910112
6508718,5,B00LWG6W2Q,Great! Start making more!!!!,1429920000,,28,6.25
6508719,4,B00LWG6W2Q,I hate that they make preppers look like idiots. Being prepared isn't stupid. Its safe and smart.,1428624000,,97,4.764705882352941
6508720,4,B00LWG6W2Q,Good show but too much false drama. In a real crisis situation most of these people would die fairly quickly.,1426896000,,109,4.5
6508721,5,B00LWG6W2Q,One of the more interesting episodes.  We enjoyed it.,1425081600,,53,4.888888888888889
6508722,4,B00LWG6W2Q,Very interesting need more of them,1424390400,,34,4.833333333333333
6508723,2,B00LWG6W2Q,"One of the worst disc designs I've seen in years! To start, there's an ad you can't skip (can at least fast-forward), then there is no menu. There is no episode list on the box, either. I know binge-watching shows is a thing, but we broke up our viewings into a couple sittings. The last time, the player lost our place & we had to skip chapters until we got to an episode we hadn't seen (and had no idea how many were left).

Overall, the episodes were okay - a good mix of rational & nutty. I'd recommend this season if there was another way to watch.",1421971200,7,553,4.12037037037037
6508724,5,B00LWG6W2Q,I have all seasons of the Doomsday Peppers seasons and I love all of them.  There is a lot of good information within these DVD's whether you are a prepped or not.,1420070400,,163,4.09375

6508728,4,B00LWG6W2Q,"This show isn't horrible.  I sometimes see some neat ideas on here.  It does have what looks to me like a lot of pretend drama because the whole idea of ""prepping"" is really just about having some safety nets and backups in the event something goes wrong...not preparing for the one thing that has given these families a phobia.
Just watch it for fun. Ignore any drama.  Try not to buy into the Wise Company constant push (it's worse that pushing cars during a show on White Collar, or Subway on Chuck).",1418774400,,503,4.445652173913044
6508729,5,B00LWG6W2Q,This is an amusing series.  Occasional good pointers for prepping.  This season was a little better than the first two seasons.,1417132800,,127,5.0
6508730,2,B00LWG6W2Q,The segments were  shorter than the previous seasons and actually not as interesting . I was not impressed at all and disappointed in this season,1416787200,4,145,4.8

6508735,4,B00LWG6W2Q,"I enjoyed the episodes of season 4 more, but the discs themselves where disappointing compared to previous seasons. There was not an episode menue, so I could not select individual episodes. I also missed the individual episode titles. Next time titles should be included, on the jacket if nowhere else.

I hope NatGeo is reading this.",1413072000,5,335,4.982142857142857

8668556,3,B00LWG6W2Q,"I've been a fan of Doomsday Preppers for many years. It's a great show that gives you a lot of practical, and some not so practical ways to prep. Season 4 is a disappointing 6 episodes, but what's worse is the quality of the discs that come in the packaging. These are cheap DVD-R's that most likely won't play on most devices. Disc 1 would only play the NG 12 second promo on my computer. Disc 2 appears to have absolutely no menu, and the episodes are not divided into tracks, only one long mash up episode is on the disc. Don't waste your money on these discs.",1514678400,,563,4.222222222222222
