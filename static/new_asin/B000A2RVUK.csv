2351746,5,B000A2RVUK,"The title of this DVD tutorial is hyperbole, dreamt up most likely by a marketing wonk working for the publisher.  Not all of the strums are ""essential"" and Ralph Shaw admits he doesn't use all of them all the time on the DVD.  But don't let that put you off. Ralph Shaw is an excellent ukulele player and an outstanding teacher.

Ralph is incredibly pleasant and is adept at breaking down the process of playing the ukulele into easily learned chunks. He has clearly taught others and thought through the order he uses to teach techniques. Best of all, he has a way of making learning to play fun. A friend of mine that has seen me play for years and never expressed an interest in playing uke did so after seeing part of this DVD while I was watching. Yes, Ralph Shaw is that charming and that alone is worth the price.

I have been playing ukulele casually for 20+ years (I am a guitar player) so the parts of this DVD that are meant for beginners were a bit rudimentary. But Shaw teaches the right way of playing and I was able to correct a few mistakes I had been making. I bought this DVD (and the other in the series, ""The Complete Ukulele Course"") mainly to learn the syncopated style of George Formby. That I learned and I was delighted with the rest of the DVD as well. Shaw's endearing style of teaching make his DVDs worth the money even if you have been playing for a while.

If you are a highly experienced player hoping to reach Bob Brozman's level, this DVD is not for you. (I love Brozman's ukulele DVD but recommend it only for advanced players.)  But if you are just getting started or have been playing a little while and want to take your ukulele skills above the average player you couldn't do better than this DVD.

Note: There is some overlap with the first DVD in the series. If you are beginner and care to work towards professional level, buy both and Brozman's as well.  If you have been playing for a while and are thoroughly comfortable with chords up the neck Essential Strums is perfect.  If you need to learn the basics or progress beyond simple chords and strums start with The Complete Ukulele Course.",1151625600,44,2136,4.401015228426396
2351747,5,B000A2RVUK,"What's good about this video is that it is organized into many chapters, each of which is stand-alone tutorial on a particular type of song and technique. If you've already got the basics that's great because you can pick what you want and get a complete lesson. Even if you haven't seen his first this has a lot of value. This is a video you can come back to over and over as your interests change or you want to try different styles in your own preference order. Includes a nifty printed chord chart and guide to the songs, which makes for a complete package. Also his personality really comes thru in a very enjoyable way. I got this along with beloff's second (which i don't recommend), and this is way better for the money. Fun and worth every penny!",1127520000,34,755,4.4

2351749,4,B000A2RVUK,I found Essential Strums to be an excellent resource.  The various strum pateerns were presented in a clear and informative manner.  The DVD was just a bit pricey but worth the money overall.,1303171200,,191,4.757575757575758
2351750,5,B000A2RVUK,"absolutely excellent. I decided to believe the review that others had written and I am so glad that I did. Ralph Shaw is an excellent teacher, a very pleasant man too. More than well worth the price. I have referred the 23 people in my ukulele club to this product and his 'Complete Ukulele Course' as well.

2351751,1,B000A2RVUK,"I wanted to sing along while watching DVD without consulting a booklet which came with DVD.

Unfortunately, no single chord diagram and no single lyric showed up on the screen.

Ralph even didn't sing ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" to inform upcoming chord even though it was the longest song on this DVD.

One of the most awkward and annoying moment.

So, this DVD just ended up with introducing bunch of strum patterns such as ""Common Strum, March, Waltz, 12-Bar Blues, Triplet Stroke, Bossa Nova, Reggae, Swing, Samba, Bo Diddley Strum, Frailing/Clawhammer and Syncopated Style"".

Less cheerful than Bartt's, less detail than Aldrine's DVD and Overpriced. (Purchased it for $29.95).

Next 2 DVDs are not strum oriented but cover very useful strum patterns conveniently.

2351752,3,B000A2RVUK,"I expected it to teach more about how to strum well, like improvise and techiniqes to make it sound better.
Instead he just teaches different styles.

The one he uses normally when singing is called the normal strum. And its just too basic. Wish he had put more emphasis on that one.",1231804800,,283,4.4423076923076925

2351754,5,B000A2RVUK,"""Never was and instructional video so well named, and such good value...
I would strongly recommend this video FOR BOTH THE BEGINNER AND THOSE WHO ARE READY TO PROGRESS beyond their basic strum.

2351757,5,B000A2RVUK,"Overall, good quality.  To enjoy, should have a good knowledge of uke chords; he goes through the sections pretty fast, so you can't be slowed down by figuring how to play a chord. Many strums are taught, worth the money and knowledge.",1174608000,5,235,4.595238095238095
8072589,4,B000A2RVUK,"Even though I have just started with this DVD I am finding it really useful. But it is material formatted for the DVD age, a video tape would get worn out in a hurry from rewinding. The material is presented VERY quickly.  And since there are a lot of tips and tricks it is easy to get overwhelmed even though there are only 12 lessons for the 2/4 strum (common) , march, waltz, 12 bar blues, triplet stroke, bossa nova, reggae, swing, samba, Bo Diddley strum, frailing/clawhamner, syncopated  style aka split stroke.",1517529600,,517,4.608695652173913

8072593,5,B000A2RVUK,"my initial impressions were that it was a bit""corny"".but as the tape progresses you realise that Shaw is the real deal .my only complaint is that he could go a little slower when breaking down the strums to their bare essentials,but of course you can always replay it-excellent",1473638400,,277,4.791666666666667
8072594,5,B000A2RVUK,"This is an excellent DVD for learning a range of different strums. Ralph Shaw is brilliant at teaching the strums and then demonstrating their use in a song at the end. So easy to learn from.

The strums are divided into music genres, for example, blues, bossa nova, etc, etc. He covers about two or three strums per genre.

This DVD would be good for a ukulele strummer who has become familiar with some basic bread-and-butter strums, and wants to move to the next level - strums that make the music sound more alive and interesting.",1464134400,,534,4.552083333333333

When he goes into the actual playing, though, it's too fast for me to follow.  Practice, practice, practice!",1362960000,,267,4.520833333333333
