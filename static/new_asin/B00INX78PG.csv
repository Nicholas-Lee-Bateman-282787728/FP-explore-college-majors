8643747,1,B00INX78PG,I bought this set for when I travel. I put the unopened package in my suitcase. Finally got around to opening it tonight. The first disc was loose in the box and was cracked. It is beyond the return window. I just learned to open all videos as soon as I get them. I have carried a lot of videos with me and never had this problem.,1523491200,,330,3.9402985074626864

8643751,1,B00INX78PG,"the story was good, but, I was very disappointed that it was black and white, and the picture quality was not good at all.

It is kind of deceptive because the picture is in color, and makes it appear that the movies are in color.",1492992000,,230,4.111111111111111
