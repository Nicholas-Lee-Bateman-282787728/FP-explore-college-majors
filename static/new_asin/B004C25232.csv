4324223,4,B004C25232,"VCI Entertainment presents ""PRECODE HOLLYWOOD DOUBLE FEATURE:HELL HARBOR & JUNGLE BRIDE"" (1930 & 1933) (209 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Editorial Reviews & Product Description on this Amazon page for your viewing interest.

FIRST FILM ON DOUBLE FEATURE:

United Artists presents ""HELL HARBOR"" (1930) (64 & 84 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Lupe Velez, Jean Hersholt, John Holland, Gibson Gowland & Harry Allen

Directed by Henry King

NOTE: Quite young and lovely Lupe Velez (the Mexican Spitfire) and the rest of the cast is good but acting is overstated. Lupe is beautiful but overdoes the cuteness - Who was once Mrs. Johnny Weissmuller (1933 - 1939) (divorced) -- Lupe committed suicide with an overdose of Seconal on December 13, 1944, she was only 36 years old.

Two versions both pre-code footage-
64 min from a 35mm nitrate mint print is very good.
84 min limited release 35 mm nitrate print:quality is fair.

SECOND FILM ON DOUBLE FEATURE:

Monogram Pictures presents ""JUNGLE BRIDE"" (1933) (63 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Anita Page, Charles Starrett, Kenneth Thomson, Eddie Borden & Gertrude Simpson

Directed by Harry O. Hoyt & Albert H. Kelley

NOTE: Actor Charles Starrett is in good form before his famous B-Western character adaptation ""The Durango Kid"" (1940-1952) gave him years of riding the trails. In this film ""Jungle Bride"" some interesting twists and turns, many are very predictable. Within a general mix makes this an enjoyable one hour afternoon viewing.

4324224,5,B004C25232,"Henry King was born in 1888 and made movies from 1912 to 1962. Andrew Sarris summarized his storytelling as turgid and rhetorical, which seems fair, especially with his later films. The Bravados, despite Gregory Peck, spectacular scenery and a splendid cast of villains, is, well, turgid. Perhaps that's why, even back before the Hayes code, Hell Harbor came in two versions, the 90 min original trimmed to 64 for ""pace"". Perhaps the work of a studio anti-turgid committee. One has to give full marks, and a giant pat on the back, to VCI not only for giving us both versions, but for unusual honesty-in-packaging about the prints. The 84 min print is the longest extant, and well worth watching. Although it has many more frame drops and random glitches than the shorter mint print, many of the deletions are brief bits of business that enrich the characters, or show interesting period detail. It also seems to have better sound and clearer dialogue in many places. It's really not that bad of a print, all things considered. Not even all that turgid, truth be told.
  Also nice of VCI to fill up the disk with an amusing minor film, Jungle Bride.
  Neither of these films is particularly salacious, and neither has nudity (although a lot more braless cleavage than after the code), but Hell Harbor does have a nice Caribbean variant of trailer-trash mayhem and lazy, quasi-sleazy atmosphere (more implied than real). One of the sailors looks like he stumbled out of Tom of Finland, and one of the bar girls replies to an advance in a man's voice, so perhaps the 'crew' were having some covert fun before Joseph Breen paddled them all for being naughty. Not a great movie, but very enjoyable, with a kind of looseness that many precode films had. Given the price, and VCI's dedication to providing a good product, this disk is a bargain.",1297209600,11,1838,4.752351097178684

8422651,3,B004C25232,"Hell Harbor (1930): A drama starring Lupe Velez

If you are a fan of Lupe Velez, you know that she is best at comedies. This movie is not as good as her Mexican Spitfire movie series where she performs beautifully. There is a lot of yelling and shouting's in this drama in which her abusive father promises to marry his only daughter to a much older merchant, played by Jean Hersholt, to pay off his debt. But Anita dreams of escaping the loneliness of her island home and go to Havana. During her struggles with her father, she meets an American and falls in love with him.

The movie is slow moving and boring; the dialogue and sound is awful and Velez's performance is a little overdone.

Jungle Bride (1933): Anita Page is gorgeous in this drama

This is certainly a little more interesting film than Hell Harbor, and if you are a fan of Anita Page, you would like this. The story is also a drama where a woman chases an entertainer around the globe in order to clear her innocent brother's name in a murder. When the ship sinks in the ocean only four people; the entertainer, his friend, the girl and a reporter land on a deserted island. There is a lot pre-marital sex, pregnancy, and partial nudity in this pre-code film just before Hay's office started enforcing moral code.",1416355200,2,1282,4.489270386266094
8422652,5,B004C25232,"Lupe was hot, cute and funny - it's a damn shame she suicided/accidentally overdosed when she was in her prime. Also a shame she was in modest but fun roles only as she might well have become a bigger star as she matured (it has happened before0.  The films were funny and entertaining . If you are looking at this review, you have come far enough to take a flyer on this pair!!!!",1394236800,,380,4.205479452054795
8422653,4,B004C25232,"I reviewed JUNGLE BRIDE separately (suffice to say it looks fabulous here) so I'll just focus on the other pre-Code offering on this great DVD from VCI - a rare, bizarre little gem called HELL HARBOR (Inspiration Pictures,1930). Even considering the filmmaking liberties of that time before censorship became strictly enforced, it's surprising this one got a general release as it's pretty strong stuff.

Produced and directed by Henry King, HELL HARBOR's sordid tale takes place at a Caribbean sea-port and stars Mexican spitfire Lupe Velez as the uninhibited daughter of an abusive father, played by Gibson Gowland. Seems Gowland is guilty of a murder that lecherous pearl trader Jean Hersholt knows about, and the latter is blackmailing the former by demanding his daughter should marry him in exchange for his silence. In addition, Hersholt tries to lure Lupe with the promise of the fortune he hopes to cash in on. The deal is set when an American merchant marine, John Holland, arrives on the island to buy Hersholt's pearls. However, once Lupe eyes the handsome American, things really start steaming. What adds to the interest is the pairing of Gowland and Hersholt, who starred as the bitter rivals in Erich von Stroheim's silent masterpiece, GREED (MGM,1924). HELL HARBOR sets them up for a similar explosive confrontation.

The film was edited from 90 minutes to 84, then down to its general release length of 64 minutes. Even in its truncated form it still packs a wallop, and hasn't been widely seen since its release. There's some sexual material (notably Lupe's transparent blouse) and graphic violence (Gowland whipping Lupe, and Hersholt stabbing Gowland's hand who then stabs Hersholt in the chest) that would never be allowed onscreen after the Production Code of 1934.

This edition offers both the 84 and 64 minute versions - only the soundtrack survives from the 90 minute version. Transferred from original 35mm nitrate prints, the 84 minute cut has a bit more wear than the 64 minute one, but it's the preferable version. The menu lists a trailer but it's not on the disc. Paired with the equally enjoyable JUNGLE BRIDE (see my review), and you can't go wrong with this exceptional double feature.

Recommended.",1384992000,4,2235,5.048780487804878
8422654,4,B004C25232,"this was a campy movie poor acting and film quality was pretty bad along with the audio, a collectors item",1378512000,,106,4.35
8422655,4,B004C25232,"This is actually one of VCI's better releases.  Both versions of Hell Harbor suffer from print damage and dialogue splices, but considering the rarity, this can be excused.  I'm glad they presented two versions.  Even though the short version has better picture quality, I very much prefer the longer one for the additional footage.  The major problem is that it is stated that the short version ""retains ALL of the pre-code footage"".  That is an outright ""LIE"".  The short version omits some pre-code material related to the gay sailor, for instance.  Also, they could have improved the long version by replacing some of the damaged scenes in it from the short one.  The other feature, Jungle Bride"", looks quite good and is very entertaining.  The case states there is a trailer, but I could not find one.",1355356800,2,807,4.8321167883211675
8422656,4,B004C25232,"DVD transfer:  All features are in B&W.  The shorter version of Hell Harbor and Jungle Bride are really very good.  I own a copy of Jungle Bride from Alpha Video and it's a total mess.  Not so here, VCI has found and used excellent prints of the films and I must say, the transfers are as good as any for films from this period.

Neither film will impress modern audiences with plot or performance so this review is for collectors.  The pre-code highlight is Hell Harbor (you need only watch the shorter version).  Lupe Velez is in top form as a girl of the tropics who's father has ""sold"" her into a marriage.  The prospective husband merely needs to sell some pearls to get the money necessary for the marriage bargain.  Lupe intercedes by finding the pearl buyer before the money changes hands.  She falls for the buyer, and he for her, and we have a dated but still entertaining pre-code drama.  Lupe spends a lot of screen time in provocative positioning but nothing beyond PG ratings.

Jungle Bride is the story of shipwrecked individuals, one of whom is suspected of murder.  Anita Page plays a young woman who is convinced that another man is guilty of the murder for which her brother is imprisoned.  She, along with her newspaper reporter fiance, follow the man aboard an ocean liner only to have the ship sink and 4 survivors wind up being marooned on a Pacific isle.  The setting is nice and Anita is truly beautiful.

The real star of this offering is the DVD transfer.  Pre-code fans will love the fine work from VCI.  This is why I gave this DVD a 4-star rating rather than the 2 or 3 stars I would have put on the films by themselves.

Highly recommended for:  pre-code fans, movie historians, fans of older fims, Anita Page fans, Lupe Velez fans.  The films are fine for kids but I doubt they will stay with Hell Harbor.  However, Jungle Bride has more of a ""Gilligan's Island"" feel and might just hold the little ones' interest.",1299024000,25,1946,4.5
