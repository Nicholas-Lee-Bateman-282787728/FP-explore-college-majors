7855919,3,6303921973,"This film kind of had a made for tv feel about it.  It was okay but needed a little more meat to it-seemed like it was somewhat contrived-even though it is based on a true story. Good performance by Bernie Casey and a very good performance by the late Ron O'Neal considering what little he had to work with-unfortunately his part in the film isn't long enough.  After his departure from the film one misses him, and the film loses some energy. Music by Taj Mahal is depressive but in keeping with the film's theme.",1149206400,3,514,4.4
