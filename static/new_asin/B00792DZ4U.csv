5063811,3,B00792DZ4U,"This film was buried in a vault for years in deference to the 1958 remake.

I was surprised that Olive Films which released this print and charges higher end prices for their releases did not make some effort to restore the film.  The print, though completely watchable, looks like a film neglected for decades with lots of dirt and scratches throughout.  This is why it lost one star.

The other lost star is because of the lead actor, Fredric March, who plays Jean Lafitte like some cartoon ""Lucky Pierre"" cartoon character.  His accent and overstated gesturing are cringe worthy.  This is odd because he was one of the great actors of the golden age of movies.  It seems that under directors like Mamoulian or Wyler or Wellman, he delivered sensitive realistic award worthy performances, but under deMille, he was left unrestrained (as were many other usually fine actors in other deMille epics) and was so hammy as to come off as comical.

All and all it's worth a look but don't expect a masterpiece.",1389225600,6,1005,4.735632183908046
5063812,5,B00792DZ4U,"The hero does act like a nave oaf at times ( standing in the surf waving a flag while the US Navy blows his men and house to bits ) but you cant help cheering him on. The dialogue they gave him were at times simply brilliant ( love the speech he gives his men on why they should become Americans, and normally I puke at patriotic drivel ). He combined what I picture to be all of the elements of what a storybook pirate should be like ( even if they did slaughter historical accuracy ).",1388448000,2,486,4.020618556701031
5063813,1,B00792DZ4U,This movie does not stand the test of time.  Frederic's French accent was really bad and the American patriotism really cheesy.,1386028800,,127,5.0476190476190474

5063815,5,B00792DZ4U,"This is one of the classic buccaneer movies of the 30s. Especially since it deals with an important part of our history. Albeit it is romanticized, it still deals with the important battle that gave US control of the Mississippi river valley and all the lands drained by it. This moment in history gave US the crucial control of lands essential to our eventual development as one of the great powers on the face of the Earth.",1359072000,2,425,4.532467532467533
5063816,5,B00792DZ4U,WOW this movie is great. Fredrich March was a great actor. I like this version of the Buccaneer very much.,1356998400,2,106,4.35
5063817,4,B00792DZ4U,"Cecil B. De Mille takes no prisoners with 1938's 'The Buccaneer,' his epic, revisionist slant on the War of 1812's Battle of New Orleans that does for that period what 'The Plainsman,' released the year prior, did for the wild west of the 1870s.  Cast in the lead is versatile Fredric March as pirate-cum-patriot Jean Lafitte, who's nothing short of electrifying as he and his merry band of brigands seemingly singlehandedly (with some assistance from Gen. Andrew Jackson, et al) decide upstart-America's victory against those dastardly Redcoats.  It is, in keeping with the De Mille tradition, a big, loud, kinetic, jingoistic production, turning history on its ear to fit its wholly Hollywoodized tale-telling; but it's also a highly entertaining-- and semi-factual-- combination of swashbuckling fun and canons-blazing romance that only the most humorless critic could disdain.  3 1/2 stars.",1356825600,12,894,5.41726618705036
5063818,1,B00792DZ4U,"First off,this film is NOT in the public domain. I don't know why Universal (who actually owns the rights) hasn't had their attorneys send a cease-&-desist letter to Amazon to have them remove this listing.

Firecake Entertainment is a completely BOGUS company, peddling nothing but junk quality DVD-Rs of movies that they CLAIM are in the public domain - and, in fact, are not.

5063820,1,B00792DZ4U,"This is one of DeMille's better films from the 1930s.  But you'd never know it from this DVD.  As Paramount owns the film (and its 1958 remake) it is pretty obvious that the film has slipped into public domain when a company like ""Firecake Entertainment"" --I did not make that one up--releases it in a print that looks as if it had been salvaged from a garbage dump. It's a battered dub of a dub of a dub so muddy that at times I had trouble making out who was who and what was what.  It says on the back of the case that it's in Dolby Digital.  Frankly if I was an attorney working for Dolby I would be suing Firecake for misrepresentation.  If you like this film (and many do) please do not buy this DVD.  The minute you put it on your TV your heart will sink.  It defines the word rip-off.",1237334400,28,792,4.070967741935484

5063852,3,B00792DZ4U,It was good.  But the remake with Yul Brenner and Charleston Heston was much better.  This original one is a little far fetched for me..of course that was all they had to work with back in the days of black and white.,1425945600,,217,4.142857142857143

Twenty years after this was made another version with the same title was filmed with Yul Brenner playing Fredrick March's role.  Anthony Quin played a character in the original film but directed the second. The 1958 version isn't available in digital format yet so I may have to just get the DVD.,1409529600,,359,4.578125

5063864,3,B00792DZ4U,"This original 1938 version by Cecil B. DeMille is quite good, but not a big Hollywood hit. This is one of the few pre-1949 talkie PARAMOUNT films that were not sold in the 1950s to MCA (Music Cooperation of America), which that company took control of UNIVERSAL STUDIOS. But today UNIVERSAL STUDIOS owns the 1929 to 1949 PARAMOUNT classic films all over 400 films with its snowy mountain trademark, but this 1938 film BACCANEER is still under property ownership of its original studio PARAMOUNT PICTURES due to its 1958 remake also by Cecil B.

DeMille production done on a grand scale. More romance than most pirate film fans care for, but this is a good adventure movie with enough action to please any viewer. The scene that stands out most vividly for me is a heart wrenching scene when the ships captain makes the beautiful, child-like Gretchen walk the plank.

The video has a nice contrast without being too light or too dark and losing the middle gray tones. The audio is perfect; I didn't have to turn my sound bar volume up to the top levels. I hope that Olive Films continues to give us more of Paramount's classic films to relish. The movie itself is no ""Ten Commandments"" or ""Greatest Show on Earth""; DeMille attempted to pull out all the stops and make a spectacular pirate movie, and it just didn't work so well. The performances come off as hammy, whereas if this film would have been made as a historical drama, it would have been more serious and downright believable. So, I give Olive Films five stars, DeMille three. Final rating is four stars. :)",1498694400,,805,4.52054794520548
