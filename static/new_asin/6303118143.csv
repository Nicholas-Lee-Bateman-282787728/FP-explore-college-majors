7838991,3,6303118143,"Well It's a short review I definately consider myself to be a wrestling connaiseur and this is in my opinion a classic however It's not like Survivor Series or Summerslam or something like that. The best thing about
is you have the Macho man hosting it which is very funny I miss that about the older days and you should too. The next best thing aboout it is that there are 3 appearances by the Hitman because at that time Vince was relying heavily on Bret,which as we all know prompted Micheals and Nash and Hall,and HHH to help destroy the dignity that Pro Wrestling had (Read
Bret's Book)or(Dynamites Book#(wrestle crap##the death of Wcw) or any book that accurately describes wrestling history)so of course the worst thing about any tape I get is when I'm forced to try and watch Nash wrestle if you can call it that. But as talented of a technical wrestler Sean#chickencrap)is ,as usual he's over the top and makes a pathetic match.",1234224000,,937,4.616766467065868
7838992,4,6303118143,"The low price of this video alone,is well worth watching the one and only encounter between The Hart's and The Steiner's in a classic! The Razor/Hbk bout was funny as you can tell these guys loved working with each other while trying to keep kayfabe. Yokozuna/Mr. Perfect bout was also a fun match to watch being a David vs. Goliath type of battle. Undertaker/Adam Bomb match was a slow lackluster,but still worth seeing the grim reaper in his true old school days! Macho Man hosting was a great addition to the video! All and all,a great Coliseum classic for a crazy low price due to mass production. A great add to your wrestling video library.",1189468800,2,646,4.626086956521739
