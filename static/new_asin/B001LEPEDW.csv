3683279,5,B001LEPEDW,"This documentary had me on the edge of my seat. Mr. Frank Alexander was Tupac's bodyguard for a short time but he became friend's with Tupac whereas other bodyguard's didn't like Pac for whatever reason. He and Pac were cool as evidenced in this film. Michael Moore who states that he did not care for Tupac is in this video telling all that he knows and laying his cards on the table. I see a whole lot of corruption and deceit and backstabbing and hatred in this film. I have always wondered what the ""Real Truth"" was about Tupac and his death, and after viewing this video, I now know. The media played a big part in getting this story all mixed up and having people confused, just like I was but not anymore. The whole East Coast/West Coast war was ""ALL"" a bunch of media hype that the public fell for, hook, line and sinker as did I. This DVD puts it all out there for anyone to view and know the truth. It is a travesty and a miscarraige of Justice that Tupac's killer and accomplices have not been brought to justice in ""16"" years. Tupac Amaru Shakur was ""Assassinated"". Just like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. before him. The video tells you step by step, who the key players were, and how they killed one of the biggest names in Rap History! If you watch this DVD and don't feel a need to do something, then something is seriously wrong with America. I urge everyone to contact the people he tells you at the end. Something must be done!",1352851200,7,1454,4.310218978102189
3683280,5,B001LEPEDW,"If you do not believe JFK's was a conconspiracy assassination well . . .  you will not believe Tupac's was . . .  same same. On the other hand, if you want to buy some beach front property in Arizona, let me know . . .  same same.",1352073600,2,230,3.75
3683281,5,B001LEPEDW,"If you are as interested as myself in what really happened to Tupac, this is one book to read of many that I found to be quite informative. I would recommend this book.",1344643200,,168,4.121212121212121
3683282,4,B001LEPEDW,"This was a awesome documentary.......not only was there alot of evidence,paperwork & visual clarity, there was also good interviews by character players in deathrow personal & security team.....you will be amazed about some of the things was never released to the public. A must see for people who wants the true behind what really happen that night in Vegas.",1287878400,10,359,5.101694915254237
3683283,5,B001LEPEDW,"Watching this documentary blew me away. These guys went and found police specialists, prosecutors, examined the rule of evidence as well as went through the 7 common steps of assasination to show how and why Tupac was killed. In interviewing the people who new and were around Tupac, his body guards, its no wonder why the LAPD, Las Vegas PD did't want to solve this mystery. This documentary also exposes Suge Knights connections with both police departments and it compared many of his statements on his dealings with death row in recent court findings and showed how they were false, even being proved in court.

They even reinacted the assasination and showed why Suge didn't want Pac's bodyguards carrying weapons, etc. As proven by the prosecutor, this information is enough to convict one of murder to a grand jury. I truly believe that it is only a matter of time before the culprits who are clearly identified and proven to have murdered Tupac on this documentary will be brought to Justice. The east cost vs. West Coast theory is a lie and totaly fradulent in the murder of Tupac. The evidence clearly points to the culprits found in Death Row itself.

If you want fancy theories and BS watch other films, but if you want the truth watch this one. Supported with Federal documents, evidence and more than enough information to convict any normal criminal in a court of law. To bad Pac's killers had money to circumvent this justice, for now!",1252281600,20,1451,4.753968253968254

3683285,4,B001LEPEDW,"This is s great film for those wanting to know more about the death of rap icon 2 Pac, with interviews from those close to 2 Pac during the period of his untimely death in 1996.",1400112000,3,177,3.9444444444444446
3683286,5,B001LEPEDW,"This offers up some real new leads in the case, and goes into incredible detail when it comes to investigating these new leads.  The end result is that the case is steered away from laying in Suge Knight's lap, and onto the real culprit for the crime.

A must have for any fan of Pac's, AND for any fan of crime investigation documentaries.",1399852800,5,340,4.380952380952381

3683288,5,B001LEPEDW,I learned a lot about what really went on at that time with him wow opened my eyes to a lot definitely worth the buy,1397433600,,116,3.68
3683289,5,B001LEPEDW,"This was a nice addition to my daughter's collection. She enjoyed watching it and learning a few things. She has been fascinated with Tupac and his story for several years now. She is 17 years old and collects/reads/watches anything having to do with him, especially pertaining to his ""real life"" and the ""conspiracy"" as opposed to just watching or listening to his music videos.

This was a decent documentary. I think while most of them provide the same info, sometimes you come across a few tidbits and here and there that are new to you and it is always nice to see a different presentation. For the price, it is definitely worth having, especially for a collector.",1385078400,4,669,4.717948717948718
3683290,5,B001LEPEDW,"He is obessed with Tupac and his death, he owns all of the documentries that were made about Tupac. So this was a good buy for him on his birthday",1363046400,,146,3.9
3683291,1,B001LEPEDW,Very disappointed with tupac assassination 2 didn't reveal nothing new a lot of old stuff bonus material was garbage...contained a lot of part 1 in it...don't waste your money,1361145600,,175,5.068965517241379
3683292,5,B001LEPEDW,"There's no question in my mind this is the most compelling case alongside Biggie Smalls I ever been obsessed with, studied with, and embrace myself with in my entire life. I heard a bit of Pac and Biggie back then in the 1990s when they first begin, but it wasn't till high school (early 2000s) that I got real deeper in their music plus the stories, their deaths, the theories and so forth. For people who needed to re-capture the original version of Tupac Assassination should find on this DVD titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2pac-Assassination/dp/B000WDTNZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2pac: Assassination</a>. I seemed to love both versions of TA 1 plus TA 2 which seems interesting. Great props to Big Frank Alexander, Cathy Scott, the people who worked with Tupac, etc. took the time to express themselves how it all happen, why it happen, and what things could've been prevented to stop it.

The thing is only God still knows the real answer, the real Truth behind it. We as fans and supporters of Tupac's music and legacy must keep going and take charge to bring all the clues, info and stuff you see from this 2-DVD set plus the first TA DVD, bringing this matter to justice. Pac could be gone, but he lives forever in our hearts.

No matter what you say, think or read between this man. This man had it all. He's never no gangsta, no thug, no by anymeans been involved in any gangs or hood related, whatever you wanted. 2Pac's wasn't just a rapper, he's also a poet, actor, activist, producer, writer and innovator.

My great advice if you want real closure in this case, and try not to get into all the B.S. nonsense what they said about Pac or Biggie, please be my guest. I know in my heart justice will be served who's ever responsible should come forward. Let's hope and pray to God this thing can happen by heart and great teamwork.

God rest the spirits of Tupac and Biggie.

Check thru Cathy Scott's book on Biggie and Tupac e.g. The Killing of Tupac Shakur and The Murder of Biggie Smalls (highly recommend), LAbrynth by Randall Sullivan, Notorious C.O.P., Biggie and Tupac 2002 documentary by British director Nick Broomfeld, Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake (Frank Alexander's first ever documentary he dropped in 2001), Got Your Back (Frank's first ever book)

Let's remember what they accomplished and achieved, not just only for their deaths and tragedies.

Godspeed, people!",1355788800,,2442,4.927007299270073
