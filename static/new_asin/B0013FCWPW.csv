8250637,4,B0013FCWPW,"First of all, let me say this was very timely for me since I have been working on playing rhythm using smaller chord forms.  In The Pocket has a DVD of Cory playing with a nice Jazz Blues Rhythm (not sure if it was a backing track since I did not see any other musicians), and comping over it using various simple chord shapes that utilize the root, third, seventh, octave.  Depending on the chord, the third and or seventh will be flattened.
Of course, it sounded really good and helped me breakthrough visualizing the thirds and sevenths of various chords. I was surprised at how well the DVD worked for me when compared with reading instructional books. It seems using both helps reinforce ideas.
He also includes some riffs with 4 or 5 notes as well as simple chord riffs. The music is also written out on a four-page insert although not all of it is annotated exactly. I was able to work with it with little or no problems.
This was one of those breakthrough moments and I am building on what I learned by adding more notes here and there to taste.
He also teaches the Blues Scale for you to utilize with riffs.
CON: The DVD's sound was not recorded well. Cory's voice is at a much lower volume than the music so I found myself having to turn the volume up and down.
Still, if you want a lesson in simple Jazz Blues comping, this should help you out. I plan to try out another in the pocket DVD now.",1383609600,,1404,4.29433962264151
