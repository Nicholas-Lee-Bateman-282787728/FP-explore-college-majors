896049,5,6304463189,"It is hard to argue with believers of the supernatural, no matter how many hoaxes are exposed. Sadly, most people are to lazy to read, but they may see a one hour documentary. Just keep this in your collection, and put it on the VCR when you have visitors. You will have then interesting conversations and arguments during the rest of the night.
The first half hour is a summary of some of the exposes by Randi, such as the claims of ""psychic"" Uri Geller, faith healers, and other. There is also simple but interesting experiments regarding astrology and palm reading.
The second half presents Randi debunking psychics in Moscow. This is great fun, as it is frustrating seeing how the psychics try to escape from his tests (one ""psychic"" cannot identify which of three glasses with water is the one he previously ""energized"", because once he thinks about the glasses, the water in all of them gets ""energized""!).
Highly recommeded. If you enjoy reading, you must check the books by James Randi (I strongly recommend you try his supernatural encyclopedia, Flim-Flam! and The Faith Healers).",971740800,17,1089,4.860215053763441
7873764,4,6304463189,"Whenever someone makes an extraordinary claim, one should be able to hold it up to the lens of the scientific method.  If said claims do not materialize, you can classify it as pseudoscience, or false science.  This documentary provides multiple examples of claims revolving around psychic abilities.

My favorite example is the Russian psychic who claims to be able to control the blood pressure and brain waves of others.  Randi places the psychic in one room, and the patient and doctors in another.  Random cards are drawn for the psychic to either manipulate the patient's blood pressure, brain waves, or do nothing.  This illustrates a scientific experiment with a control group, an experimental group, and set up double-blind to boot!",1309219200,,741,5.133333333333334

This video probably turned more of my students into skeptical freethinkers than any other thing I used. If you still have a vhs player, and if you have middle school age kids of your own, you should buy this right now!  James Randi is very entertaining, so your kids will be interested in what he has to say.

It is especially important in this day and age when logic and reason in our media is completely nonexistant.  In a world of charlatans where even the most obvious bunk is given credit by an ignorant and apathetic press, this program reveals the critical thinking skills necessary to cut through the lies and spin doctoring so prevalent in our society today.  It is more relevant to todays problems than when it was first produced many years ago.  The Amazing Randi is truly a man for our times.",1281139200,,580,4.6568627450980395

7873768,5,6304463189,"I love this video. It should be a required part of the science curriculum in our schools. This video shows ""critical thinking"" in action and the world would be a much better place if people would learn this very important skill.

As the video graphically illustrates there as those people who, when smacked in the face with reality, will still ignore the facts. This is yet another important lesson that people need to learn (sad as it may be).

In summary, it's highly entertaining and exceedingly educational. My only beef is that it's not available on DVD.",1174694400,,559,4.752577319587629
7873769,5,6304463189,"Mr. Randi has done a great service in exposing frauds.  It can be rather like when you first discovered the truth about the Easter Bunny in that you will become not just skeptical but perhaps over-cynical at the same time.  The line between the two can be very fine.  But truth is always better than believing a lie.  Always challenge what you believe to be true by taking a step back and observing from the outside as much as possible.  Those of us who are naturally skeptical need to avoid the ""I told you so"" attitude and leave the door open for things that may be beyond human understanding - never lose the wonder or believe that science always has the answers.  As sure as science has brought us medicine and flights to the moon, it has also brought us the ability to destroy our world many times over in a matter of minutes.  Seek the truth but never assume you have found all the answers or that there is not some corner of the world you have not yet explored.  Take Mr. Randi's inquisitive mind as an example of always seeking and questioning.  But balance a healthy skepticism with a healthy humility that allows that there may be things our senses cannot observe and therefore cannot explain.",1159833600,,1203,4.481651376146789
7873770,1,6304463189,"If you're a skeptic when it comes to psychic matters and believe that the world we see around us is all there is, then this is the perfect video for you.

James Randi, while likable and interesting to watch, might be one of the most closed-minded people in the world. He says in this video that the only reason people have ""psychic"" experiences is because they believe in them. He also goes on to say that the successes attributed to psychic research are probably because the researchers are completely open-minded and want to believe that it is real. I agree with that. I also think there need to be people who are totally objective to this kind of thing doing the experiments. Randi is NOT one of those people. His whole purpose is to *disprove* psychic phenomenon, rather than find out if it's for real or not. That's just as dangerous as going into a study with a completely open mind and belief that it will be a success. Another problem with Randi's experiments is that he doesn't do enough of them! Proving that two ""psychics"" are con-artists does NOT prove that EVERY psychic is a con-artist. (Well, it does for completely closed-minded people like Randi, which is basically every reviewer on this page!)

Another problem with Randi is that he focuses on very trivial things like spoon bending. Of course you can recreate that using tricks! That's a no-brainer. Why doesn't he try to recreate other psychic phenomenon?

Anyway, while this is the perfect video for the skeptic, it will likely leave a sour taste for those who have had psychic experiences. If you've been out-of-body or have woken up in a dream, fully conscious of what was going on, then Randi's conclusions that science is the source of all that's good and that the only thing that is real is the material world might seem a bit ridiculous.

Good luck to Randi on his million dollar challenge, but I don't think that he will ever have a psychic experience or meet a real psychic. Why, you might ask? Because he is so intent on disproving psychic phenomenon, that even if it happened right in front of him (or to him), he would not know it. If you're so closed-minded about something, you will never be able to experience it--or accept that it happened once you HAVE experienced it. (""My mind must be playing tricks on me."")

I like to keep an open mind. That does not mean that I believe everything I hear/see. The first time I heard about out-of-body experience and astral projection, I did not believe in it 100%. I kept an open mind and thought to myself: ""Wow, this is interesting. What if it's true? Well, let's find out!"" And I did. The point being if you don't try something out for yourself, you'll never know if it's real or not--you can just THINK about it and form your own OPINIONS, but you will never really KNOW anything for sure until it has happened to you.

Randi tries to figure out how to make it look like the spoon is bending, rather than trying to bend the spoon. Therein lies his problem.

Once again, if you're a closed-minded skeptic, then this is probably a good video to add to your collection.

7873771,5,6304463189,"What's wrong with belief in the paranormal, pseudoscience, and--not incidentally--fundamentalist religious beliefs? Everything. When we're too easily seduced into believing based on the flimsiest of evidence, we blind ourselves to the sense of wonder we can get from looking clear-eyed at the world right before our eyes, to the mysteries that hard science simultaneously explains and deepens. I agree with the previous reviewers that this Nova episode is an excellent overview of how psychics deceive us, and many times themselves. (All my life people have insisted that I'm psychic; careful exercise of my reason has shown me I am not, and many of the principles I've used are explained in this film.)

Because Randi deals with some of the ""best"" in the psychic field and communicates so clearly, this video might be just the thing to get people thinking, especially people who won't read. We can't expect a true believer in psychic phenomena to buy a copy, though, can we? If everyone who has seen it would donate a copy to their library, maybe we'd begin to make some inroads into the epidemic of irrational belief.

The late, great Johnny Carson was a great friend and supporter of James Randi, frequently sending six-figure checks to the James Randi Educational Foundation. This production will delight you with some classic scenes from Mr. Randi's many visits to the Carson show, including the ones pulling the wool off Uri Geller and ""healer"" Peter Popoff.

At the end of this film, in a statement also repeated on James Randi's website, he says: ""A lot of people hate my skepticism, and I think I understand why. The psychics offer wonders and endless possibilities in a world that often seems difficult and mundane. They promise health, wealth, wisdom, eternal life. But if you examine the record, it's not the psychics but the hard-nosed scientists who have actually delivered the things that improve human life. And, to me, science describes a world far more interesting than any psychic fantasy. It's a good world - not perfect - but it's ours. So we'd better learn to live with it, the way it is.""

Well said, Mr. Randi. I would reiterate that the real world ""the way it is"" is much stranger, many times more wondrous than the one offered us by the charlatans.
