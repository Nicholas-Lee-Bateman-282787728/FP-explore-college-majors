8496862,1,B00112OC5U,"This is the worst DVD that I have ever purchased. I don't even think this should be called a movie. I have seen some home movies better. I bought this by mistake, I thought it was something else. I was very surprised when I tried to watch it. I wish I could get my money back for this. I paid over twenty five dollars for this, and I have gotten good movies for much less than that. Overall, this product sucks.",1206489600,9,411,4.08641975308642
8496863,4,B00112OC5U,"hey! if they made this for 56,000 little ones i guess they did ok.  if they got through the, or if the audience can get through the first twenty minutes the video gets pretty interesting.  i guess that the new high resolution cameras are pretty good, considering what i have had to sit through years ago with viewing murky videos.  It is definetly better than the ""blair witch project"".  The sound track was ok but i think the video editing could have been done a little cleaner.  All in all though the movie is entertaining and when the next Halloween comes around I am going to dust it off and show it to my friends.  After viewing it a few times,  I think it may even become a classic in the horror genre.",1201219200,,708,4.2781954887218046
