Please heed my advice!",1429833600,,105,4.578947368421052
7995145,5,B0000A0WH7,"Very moving and extremely enlightening filmed one man play, written and
performed by the British playwright David Hare. Directed with a light,
deft touch by Stephen Daldry (The Hours)

It recounts Hare's experiences visiting Israel, as he interviewed
people on all sides of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. Not only is
Hare's writing terrific (no surprise), but he reveals real charisma and
emotional accessibility as a performer (yes, he's playing himself, but
ask any actor - that's one of the hardest things to do).

I felt like I learned more in this 90 minutes, while also being more
touched (and occasionally made to laugh) than I have from any other 5
dramatic films or documentaries on the subject combined.

Quite special and overlooked, and well worth seeking out.",1315353600,3,775,5.134920634920635
7995146,5,B0000A0WH7,"David Hare is brilliant.  His performance, his writing, his intelligence is beyond compare.  Anybody who is interested in the Middle East and thinks they understand what's going on should see Hare's first hand account of his time there.",1305244800,,236,5.184210526315789
7995147,5,B0000A0WH7,"Hare combines immediacy and reflectiveness in a most unusual presentation. It's heart-wrenching, provocative, and frequently very, very funny.",1244419200,,142,6.944444444444445

7995149,5,B0000A0WH7,"In an age when there is a dearth of ""plays"" on Broadway, and country-wide, it was w/great expectations that I watched VIA DOLOROSA this evening.
To be privy to a brilliant mind, David Hare's, for 90 minutes is a glorious and intelligent pleasure. How remarkable to actually THINK.
He takes us from his home in Hampstead, London, to the killing fields of Israel and the Gaza Strip. In between we meet an unusual ""cast"" of characters (it's technically a one-man show), one more interesting than the next.
In light of what is happening in Israel and Palestine as I write this,  September 9th, I wonder if Mr. Hare is planning a sequel. Unfortunately, there is far too much information to warrant a follow up.
This was an actual performance that took place at the Booth. How lucky I was to have my front row seat.
Sit back, listen and THINK!",1063065600,6,837,4.58
