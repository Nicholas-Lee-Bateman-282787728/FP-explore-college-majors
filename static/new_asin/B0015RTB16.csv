8259725,1,B0015RTB16,"This guy is not an expert instructor in the art of wushu and really has no business releasing an instructional DVD on this Chinese martial art. Just looking at the cover, the stance, arm positions, posture, and even uniform are all wrong. He's an expert in sport karate, not wushu. Two very different things.",1296691200,2,308,4.722222222222222
8259726,1,B0015RTB16,"I saw a preview of this instructor's Wushu on Youtube. And it baffles me that he can claim to teach Wushu, when he doesn't even have a grasp of the basics himself! And then on top of that, teach an entire form? NO!!!

Do NOT BUY THIS!!

And Suprah? I've been involved in Wushu for at least 8 years now, and I have NEVER heard of this.",1207008000,,334,3.970149253731343
8259727,1,B0015RTB16,"I saw a youtube introduction to his Wushu video and let me tell you his Wushu is downright horrible.  I've been practicing Wushu for 10 years and it doesn't even take that to see this guy really doesn't have any sort of command over Wushu.

Regardless, always be wary of people stating they are masters of a gazillion different martial arts.  More often then not, they are quacks.  Go to someone who specializes in the martial art you are interested in and you'll get better quality.

Note: I didn't actually purchase this but again, I did see his preview of the video and I don't want anyone wasting their money on this.  I have dedicated a lot of time to Wushu and I don't want to see it misrepresented like this.  He may or may not be good at one of his other martial arts.  I am not qualified to comment on those other martial arts.",1206835200,5,836,4.314102564102564
