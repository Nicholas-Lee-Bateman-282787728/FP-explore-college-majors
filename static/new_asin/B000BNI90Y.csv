2429516,1,B000BNI90Y,"The HIGHLY OVERRATED Sci-Fi Channel show.  Think ""Beverly Hills 90210"" rather than Battlestar.  SOOO different from the original, the name should have NEVER carried over.  It's not a 're-imagining', but a totally different story with elements of other Science Fictions shows thrown in.  I mean, if you ""re-imagined"" the sinking of the Titanic, would you actually call the ship the ""Edmund Fitzgerald"" which sank on it's last voyage in 1613 B.C. crossing the Mississippi River  due to hitting a discarded scoop of ice cream?  NO!  It WOULDN'T be about the TITANIC anymore.

The show MAY have been fine in it's own right, but the producers gave a lot of lip service to understanding the ""valuable property"" they had, and they would do things ""right.""

It was an attempt to cash in on the name while throwing away 98%  of the original, and keeping only the names and a couple of other concepts.

If you like the original, stay away from here!",1129161600,7,939,4.770186335403727
2429517,5,B000BNI90Y,"The second season of the highly overlooked Battlestar Galactica is definitely shaping itself into a very serious and dark non-escapist TV show. It is not shy about the subject matter it depicts, but the writers and producers still know where to draw the line and leave you reflecting and not cowering. Leaving no event under-analyzed, the show uses Murphy's law at every available instance. The result is wonderfully dramatic TV and a gritty series that surprisingly continues to shock viewers and shed the ""after-school special"" cheesiness if the sci-fi genre. The characters are still as realistic and true to human nature as they ever were, and the plot is just as enticing as it was in the first season. This is a definite buy, if you can't wait for the full season box set next year.",1129161600,16,788,4.801470588235294
2429518,5,B000BNI90Y,"Like a previous reviewer mentioned, when Sci-Fi Channel announced that they were producing a new BSG show, I was causiously optimistic.  I was hoping that it would revive an old classic.  To a lot of people's surprise...it did.  In fact, the new Battlestar Galactica has been called the ""Best Show on TV"" by a lot of media organizations.  However it's getting some flak by a small but vocal group of die-hard fans of the original show.  So much so, that they have banned discussion of the new show on their web site.  Yes, I'm talking about you guys at 'CF.com'.  ""Family show...""  Eh?  Ahemmm...the new show was never billed as a family show.  It is clearly an adult drama set in space.  I'm as conservative as you all are, but I know the difference between '70's space cheese and 21st Century sci-fi.

Anyway, for those who haven't seen this show, but you like a good character drama, be sure to check out this show on DVD.  I believe it's even better on DVD.  For one, you don't have the commercials and second, you don't have to wait between weeks for the the next episode.  There's a lot of continuity between episodes...and unlike Star Trek, they don't hit the proverbial ""Reset Button"" between episodes.  What's damaged on a ship in one episode stays damaged in following episodes, as the first season takes place just over a 3 month period.

The second season here picks up right where the first season left off.  The major plot thread that was started with the first season's finale 2-part cliff-hanger, is built upon and concluded in the the first 5 or 6 episodes of the second season here.  The remaining couple of episodes are more of stand-alone type episodes that are probably building up to what is to occur in the second half of this season which will air from January thru March.

Now then, why is Universal offering just a half season here?  Who really knows.  Although getting these episodes out before the second half airs is not really a bad thing, just a strange thing.  I guess since the show is such a hit, Universal figures that they could boost their ratings for the second half if they get all available episodes out on DVD before the second half airs.  This set, however, will include a ""90-minute"" (60 minute actual) version of the mid-season cliff-hanger episode ""Pegasus"".  So with that, there's at least some incentive to buy this set rather than wait for a possible full season set next year that may or may never come.

UPDATE:  I've been informed by a very observant reader that my above post is inaccurate with some out of date false information.  I agree.  So without further adue, I'll update the info below.

Above I said that a 60+ minute version of ""Pegasus"" was going to be included on this set.  That is incorrect.  First of all, that fact was just a rumor spawned by what was said during one of the Podcasts, I believe.  However, due to time constraints, Universal Studios was unable to ""ready"" the extended version of ""Pegasus"" for this release.  Why so?  Who knows...

However, it has been reported that the extended version will be on the 2.5 set that will complete the second season.  So in essence, fans who have bought both sets will have both versions of this episode.  This is similar to the recent problem with the Stargate SG-1 Season 8 set in which the extended 60+ minute version of ""Threads"" was supposed to be included, but ultimately wasn't.  This was remedied by a mail-in offer done by CheckMyRebate.com.

Also, I mention that a full season set, may or may not be offered eventually after the entire season is done airing.  After acquiring the 2.0 set, I noticed that there is a half of a image on the spine.  The image being one half of the Galactica Seal and President Roslin.  I assume the 2.5 set will have the other half of the Galactica Seal and presumably a pic of Commander/Admiral Adama.  So with that, I'm beginning to assume that a complete Season 2 set may not in the future.  Although I may be proven wrong...but we'll see.",1128643200,330,3997,4.583333333333333
2429519,5,B000BNI90Y,"I really had mixed feelings when Sci-fi Channel announced plans for a new Battlestar Galactica. I was plauged with recurring visions of Galactica 1980(if you've never seen it be greatful).

When the mini-series hit the airwaves(or perhaps cablelines?)I

wished they had renamed all of the characters as it was difficult to wrap my head around Apollo and Adama not getting along;a drunk (and white)Tigh:a female Starbuck;and a Boomer who was not only female and asian but a Cylon as well.

As I said to a friend after it ran I think I would have loved it had they called it ANYTHING other than Battlestar Glactica.

When Sci-fi ran it again ahead of the new series I gave it another shot and I am SOOOO glad I did!!!!

The mini-series is FABULOUS;the 1st season is AMAZING;and the 2nd season revisits with new twists and turns many of the plots of the original including Battlestar Pegasus(I really love to hate Admiral Cain)!!!!

I cannot say enough good things about the new Battlestar Galactica!!!",1128643200,13,999,4.812865497076023
2429520,5,B000BNI90Y,"This three-disc set will include the first half of Season 2 (10 episodes). These episodes were shown in July-September 2005 on the SciFi channel.

New fans of the show

---------------------

Battlestar Galactica is shown on the SciFi channel. The SciFi channel seasons are different from typical TV seasons. SciFi breaks a season into two pieces: First half is July to September, and second half is January to March. Season 2 will consist of a total of 20 episodes (10 x 2). This DVD set contains the first 10 episodes (episodes 1-10). The 2nd half of Season 2 (episodes 11-20) will begin broadcasting on the SciFi channel in mid-January thru late March 2006.

Bonus Materials?

----------------

* RDM mentioned in his podcast that Universal has agreed to include a special 90-minute version of episode #10 ""Pegasus"". The episode broadcast on the SciFi channel was 62 minutes long (including commercials). (Not sure if 90 minutes refers to total runtime, or the equivalent of a 90-minute episode as it would be shown on TV). Will it be included on this DVD set or the future (unannounced) complete season 2 dvd set or both? That is not known.

DVD sets

--------

At this point it is not known how the rest of Season 2 will be released in 2006. Will there be a 2B DVD set or a complete season 2 set? Where will special features be included? At this point it is not known.",1128384000,16,1373,4.66390041493776
2429521,5,B000BNI90Y,"It's hard to believe that things could get any worse for the 50,000 humans left alive in the universe.  Last year, the 12 Colonies of Kobol were nearly blown away by the cylons, machines that resemble humans, nearly ran out of water and fuel, and had the two leaders somehow incapacitated.  Commander William ""Husker"" Adama (Edward James Olmos) was shot by Junior Lt. Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii (Grace Park), who turned out to be a cylon, while President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) was put in Galactica's brig for convincing Lt. Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) to defy Commander Adama.  Starbuck is now on Caprica, stranded with Lt. Karl ""Helo"" Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett) after another copy of the Boomer cylon stole the ship that Starbuck used to get to the planet.  Captain Lee ""Apollo"" Adama (Jamie Bamber), the commander's son, is also under arrest for attempting to stage a mutiny with the president and pointed a gun at the head of the Executive Officer of Galactica, Col. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan).  Finally, Vice President Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis), Chief Gallen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), Lt. ""Crashdown"" (Sam Witwer), and Specialist Cally (Nicki Clyne) are stranded on Kobol and are surrounded by cylon centurions.  As I said, things start out bad, and they only get worse.
With the older Adama unconscious, Tigh is put in charge, and it is clear that he is no leader.  He has an alcohol problem, an ambitious wife (Kate Vernon), and a surly attitude towards most people.  Furthermore, his relationship with Apollo, who is the head pilot on Galactica, is obviously very strained now that Apollo put his gun to Tigh's head.  In the first two episodes, Galactica gets seperated from the rest of the fleet, leaving the civilians defenseless, and a cylon raiding party boards the ship and attempts to take out the ship from within.
On Caprica, Starbuck and Helo try to find a way off the planet, only to run into a human resistance group that has been operating out of an old hospital.  But they aren't the only ones that Starbuck finds; a frightening plot is uncovered by her when she encounters a group of cylons.  Meanwhile, the people on Kobol are forced to fend for themselves while Galactica is busy trying to find the fleet and deal with Boomer.  Number Six (Tricia Helfer) begins to get a firmer grip over Baltar's mind, and gets him to do more and more questionable deeds.
And that's all in the first few episodes.  Unlike most shows, the problems presented at the end of Season 1 aren't solved in the first episode.  Many of them are so deep that it requires multiple episodes to resolve certain characters' predicaments.  I'm going to give a small spoiler by saying that eventually, everyone makes it back to Galactica, meaning that Helo is back on the ship for the first time since the Miniseries pilot.  Of course, this creates only more trouble due to the bizarre love triangle that exists between Tyrol, Boomer, and Helo.  Each man loved her, and in S1, they each got to know a different copy of the same model.  Now, they both have a love/hate relationship with the copy remaining on Galactica.  Further troubles come about through the paranoid actions of crew members (my favorite involving Specialist Cally), the introduction of 2 new human-form cylon models (bringing the total to 6, leaving 6 left to be uncovered), and the reappearance of political ""activist"" Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch, of the original Battlestar Galactica).
These 10 episodes further prove that a science fiction show can not only be good, but be amazing.  It is a shame that this show is overlooked by many people as just a ""sci-fi"" show, but it is so much more.  Most critics as well as the relatively large number of fans (for a show on a cable genre network, it sure does get good ratings) recognize that this is a compelling drama that just happens to take place in outer space.  It deals with weighty subjects such as genocide, human flaws, paranoia, and religion.
This season retooled the opening theme a little bit.  The music is now the chant used in Season 1 in the UK (instead of the march used last year in the US), and while most of the clips are still from the miniseries, there are a few from the previous year.  For a while, the second part of the credits, which showed scenes from the episode set to a drum beat, was removed, only to be replaced halfway into the run (fortunately).  The most interesting addition is a textual representation of how many people are still alive.  Each week in the credits, there is a sentence which lists the exact number of survivors, and it changes every week, depending on how many people died (or appeared) the week before.
It's hard to say which season is better (so far; this is only half of S2, which I'll get to soon).  The 13 episodes of S1 were all great.  In the first half of S2, there are no ""bad"" episodes per se, but there are some episodes that don't seem up to the usual quality that we expect from Battlestar Galactica (such as ""Valley of Darkness"").  However, the best episodes of the season (so far) have been absolutely amazing.  ""Scattered"", ""Home, Parts 1 and 2"", and ""Pegasus"", which in my opinion is the best episode of the series so far, are sheer brilliance.
As for the whole ""Season 2.0"" thing, I am very upset about this.  All the respect that I had for Universal for releasing the Miniseries with the S1 set evaporated when I learned that they were pulling this stunt.  Due to the schedule of the Sci-Fi channel, they are releasing the first half of S2 before Christmas, and then when the season ends in March, they'll release the second half, thus forcing us to spend more money on these two sets than we would have to if it were one set.  I really hope that they eventually release ""The Complete Second Season"", and I will hold off buying this until I get a definitive answer.  If there isn't going to be a Complete S2 set, I will buy both sets (I will be a little ticked off, but I love BSG too much), but if they release a Complete S2 set, I would reccomend buying that one.
This is one of the best show's on TV right now.  If you are a sci-fi fan, this is a must-see show.  If you aren't a sci-fi fan, you should still consider checking this out.  Even though it's in space and has killer robots, it is more human than most other drama shows on TV today.  So say we all.",1128384000,229,6356,4.592035398230088

The cast have now gelled into a cohesive team and the characters are developing some depth (in much the same way as the cast of Star Trek Voyager took a while to get comfortable with one-another). The writing seems to have improved too, with noticeably more pace and tension and some nice on-going sub-plots. The `Pegasus' episodes were particularly brilliant. On the strength of this, we have ordered the mini-series and series three and four (which is, rather oddly, split into `series 4' and `the final series') and can't wait for them to arrive.",1420934400,,857,5.035211267605634

2429573,5,B000BNI90Y,"Season 1 of the re-imagined ""Battlestar Galactica"" ended with a bang, literally and figuratively.  Commander Adama tried to unseat President Roslin's government after a profound disagreement over the direction of the search for Earth; the Colonials score their first significant victory over the Cylons by destroying their basestar above the lost world of Kobol; and Sharon Valerii's true nature gets revealed to all as she tries to assassinate Commander Adama.

  With the ragtag fleet in disarray, Season 2 begins by trying to pick up the pieces.  It achieves this in fine fashion as it continues to explore the very nature of humanity as it struggles not only with act of survival, but also to concept of how they will survive.  The Raptor crew shipwrecked on Kobol strives to stay alive while Galactica figures out how to rescue them.  While on Kobol, the quest for more clues and signs about how to get to Earth are pursued.

  Another interest component of Season 2 is Starbuck's return to Caprica, to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo for President Roslin.  She comes into contact with Helo and the other Sharon, which stirs up tremendous conflict.  She also discovers that there is still a scrappy resistance movement fighting to make life hell for the Cylons.

  The second half of the season focuses on healing the wounds left behind by the military/government rift.  The development of the characters continues in fine fashion, especially with Grace Park coming into her own as Sharon now that her Cylon nature is known.

  In fine BSG fashion, the season ends with a big cliffhanger when Battlestar Pegasus (presumed to be destroyed during the original Cylon attack) appears and brief euphoria of finding more humans is quickly replaced by the terror of Admiral Cain's `win-at-all-costs' dictatorial leadership.

  With the exception of the discovery on Kobol, the forward moves are smaller in Season 2.  However, this is not a negative.  The plot continues to evolve organically and the end result is another satisfying run of BSG.",1374364800,,2039,5.0359281437125745

2429584,4,B000BNI90Y,"Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.

Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.

Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.

As much as I like individual episodes in Season 2, the meta-plot as a whole is somewhat ridiculous. Season 2 ventured heavily into pseudo-religious nonsense. I have nothing against religion, but the use of religious metaphors in BSG was always a bit too on the nose. Oddly, the show doesn't use religion to talk about morality, in the way that Star Trek was often a series of morality plays, but rather as plot devices. By Season 2, the president is running around looking for Earth based on religious prophecies. Meanwhile, everybody proclaims that the baby of a human and Cylon is the ""sign of things to come"" without ever explaining the baby's significance to the audience.

Unfortunately, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. To put it bluntly, they're boring and not particularly threatening after the first few episodes. The idea of biological machines is never really explained satisfactorily - the Cylons appear to be exact copies of humans, even feeling human emotions, and act nothing like machines. Yet, they're supposed to be machines bent on conquering humans? The male Cylons are portrayed as boring and dull while the female Cylons are either slutty or overly emotional. In this season, the Cylons are shown to be a bunch of goofy religious fanatics and the threat factor is almost completely eliminated.

Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like the larger story or the Cylons. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans.",1356480000,,2837,4.989429175475687

2429591,5,B000BNI90Y,"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'
and 'Breaking Bad'.

Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,
not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like a
great novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.

Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich' world of the cop
show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar
Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot
wars the same way.

This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,
or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be
a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,
fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent
politics and real world situations.

My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore
through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.

The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are
remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and
contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to
change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly
inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -
but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've
taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,
even if they're not really why you watch this show.

It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever
seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and
blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to
finish a great book.

This second season builds the characters and issues wonderfully, although
there's the occasional episode that feels a little less connected
to the central story.  But with a rare combination of intelligence,
tension, ideas and emotions, even the weaker episodes have something
to offer.",1320796800,,2026,4.785100286532951

2429602,4,B000BNI90Y,"You simply cannot jump into BSG with season 2. None of it will make sense. None of it will compel you.

But if you've followed the series from season 1, you practically *must* see through the story line to season 2. And fortunately, most of season 2 lives up to the high quality of the first season.

This set is only truly the first ""half"" of season 2 - season 2.5, while technically labeled and sold separately, is really the second half of season 2. This first half, fortunately, almost stands on its own, and aside from the final episode ""Pegasus,"" is not truly tied to the second half - thus, it is possible (if you bought season 1) to buy this season of BSG, and not continue further with the series. It may not fully end the story of the Battlestar Galactica and its crew, but it does leave it on at least a satisfactory note.

Season 2 picks up right where 1 left off, and continues to track Galactica and its crew through an ongoing crisis (or three). Along the way we get greater insights into the history of the self-destructive Colonel Tigh, what makes Apollo tick and why he has that gigantic chip on his shoulder, and what can crack the tough facade of Starbuck - as well as some amazing glimpses of what that Cylon ""plan"" really might be.

As I said, one could watch most of this season, stop around episode 7 or 9, and not watch further. Beware, however, that once you've decided to go ahead and continue with ""Pegasus,"" you will be nearly forced to continue the story through season 2.5. Don't let this stop you, however - that episode gives us new characters, new crises, and one of the absolute best performances by Callis and Helfer (but it is gut and maybe heart-wrenching - be prepared to be disturbed). On the strength of this episode, Helfer won acting awards for what can only be described as brilliant, natural acting talent.",1254096000,,1851,4.4674556213017755
2429603,5,B000BNI90Y,"Even though season two was cut up into Season 2.0 and 2.5, the first half is still filled with all kinds of action, plot, and character development.

Last we saw, ""Boomer"" shot Adama.

We all held our breaths and waited for Season 2.0.

Adama does not die, but things do not go perfectly on Galactica with our favorite commander healing up.  ""Starbuck"" goes off to Caprica to try to get the Arrow of Apollo for Roslin.  She runs into ""Helo"" and a Sharon copy.  We see a lot of Cylon copies from now on.  Riots break out all over the fleet and Tigh starts to talk about what to do with ""Boomer"" and Tyrol.  ""Boomer"" doesn't get her judge and jury, but is quickly sentenced by Cally.  On Caprica, they run into a resistence movement and ""Starbuck"" ends up captured and experimented on by Cylons.

Meanwhile, in the fleet there is a division - there are two sides: Roslin & Zarek.  Adama finally gets back onto his feet and tries to reunite the fleet.  His fleet.  Adama and Roslin work much better in this season even though they still have their problems.

In the final episode of this half-season we meet the Pegasus, another Battlestar.  After all the time they believed they were the sole surviving Battlestar they are amazed to have another.  Adama and Roslin must give over the control of the fleet to Admiral Cain.  Roslin isn't thrilled with this idea, but Adama has no other choice.  This addition of not only a Battlestar, but another crew with resources and Vipers is an asset to the whole fleet.",1250899200,,1505,4.511111111111111
2429604,5,B000BNI90Y,"I'm a latecomer to ""Battlestar Galactica"" and am just now watching them on DVD.  Season 2.0 consists of 10 episodes, which pick up immediately where Season 1 ended.  The many cliffhangers from Season 1 are spun out over a plot arc comprising the first five episodes.  It's a bit unexpected having so many loose ends lingering (so many shows nowadays resolve everything in the first episode of each season), but the producers and writers manage to milk these plots for all they're worth without making them seem too prolonged.  Without giving away too much plot, it's safe to reveal that these episodes focus on the survivors continuing to search for earth while also trying to bring the fleet back together.  The next five episodes feature more self-contained episodes and end with a big surprise that seemingly changes the course of the series.  I have to admit that I wasn't happy with the final episode of Season 2.0, but I'll give the producers and writers the benefit of the doubt and assume that they will make it work.

Two new cylons are introduced during the course of these ten episodes.  It's unclear whether we'll be seeing these two versions often in the future, but they're interesting additions to our first four models.  The most compelling arc for me was the budding rivalry between Helo and Chief, and the two mens' anguish over the Sharon situation.  Take away the cylon aspect of this plot, and it's still a solid love triangle, with the three actors making the most of these scenes.  Overall, Season 2.0 is solid - just a tad lesser than the stellar Season 1.  The DVD set is good, although there are fewer episode commentaries and behind-the-scene peaks than we received on the Season 1 set.  Season 2.0 is followed by Season 2.5, which also consists of 10 episodes.  Ideally, these two mini-seasons should have been packaged together at a reasonable price; however, cable television series do tend to be more expensive on dvd, so I won't begrudge them their profits here.",1249084800,,1994,4.792397660818714

The upshot for consumers is that we have to pay close to $80 to acquire the full season 2 - far above the average price for a single season set, even for imported series like Doctor Who and Torchwood.

As for the content, the first half of Season Two is just mind blowing.  The whole story arc of what happens down on Kobol and what happens to to the fleet once a drunken Tigh takes command is well written, well acted, and a joy to watch.  ""Valley of Darkness"" and ""Fragged"" are both cinematic masterpieces while ""Flight of the Phoenix"" shows that the writers are actually capable of making a stand alone episode that works.

Unfortunately, when it was time to buy season 2, I couldn't bring myself to pay for Season 2.0 and season 2.5.  I felt that if I was able to be a proud owner of BSG Season one Complete for under fifty bucks then I wouldn't mind having BSG Season 2 Complete for around 50 bucks as well.
So for brevity, I ended up just watching Season 2 via the local video store as I wait for the price to go down.
I know the production cost for BSG is high and Season 2 does have more episodes than season one so I gave my review 3 stars instead of 2.

2429627,4,B000BNI90Y,Season two continues where the first season leaves off. There are more glimpses of things to come and the plot continues to engage the veiwer.,1204848000,,142,4.72
2429628,5,B000BNI90Y,"(Get both Season 2 boxes if you are in for this.)

The makers of Battlestar Galactica (BSG), who proved they had a big enough brass pair to offer up a challenge to Star Wars and Star Trek, have blasted this series up there with the best of the best. It is fraking mind-blowing television and some of the best SF since Luke Skywalker trusted the force and Spock tried to fix a damaged warp core.

BSG is barely recognizable from the 1970s original series. Such is the scope of the makeover and development of the original storyline that all previous BSG series history has been declared void by the writers and the story has gone through a creative renewal. This reimagining was done to enhance the concept... and the reboot has paid off in aces.

The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. There are many copies. And they have a plan. In the past, there was a war. The Cylons left. Now they are back and they want revenge. They chase and try to kill humans of the twelve colonies across the galaxy.

BSG season 2 continues with the search for the Spear of Athena in the hope that it will point the way back to Earth. The religious elements become central to the story, especially the Cylon resurrection system, which becomes a target for a visually knocking out battle sequence. There are even crossover renegade groups starting to form in each camp. The new arrival of an important addition to the fleet and some of the most thrilling sequences yet seen for a show of any kind. BSG has also adopted more adult themes and has moved away from family viewing to allow for harder action sequences and higher intensity crises.

Season 2 takes place mainly on the deck of the Galatica, but also on Colonial One (the President's cruise ship), the planets Caprica, Kobal and New Caprica. There is lots of powerhouse acting. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) maintains his position as one of the most memorable characters in television history (you can rank him up there with the likes of Captain Picard). Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) as the President goes through some radical character dilemmas as does Starbuck, a woman in this version of BSG, whose background love relationships are as important as her action-woman persona. Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber) ascends up the ranks and Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) finds himself in an impasse between himself and the Cylons. Number Six (Tricia Helfer) starts a type of revolution. Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) relationship with his wife has an impact on his career. Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park) is a powerful Cylon presence that makes an impact on the storyline. Can the Cylons co-exist with humans? ... Can they hybridize? This is but a small section of the interesting storylines and enormous cast that BSG has to offer... and yes important characters do die, so its edge of your seat stuff through and through.

The CGI is up there the best ILM can put out. One sequence in which an ejected pilot, Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama, observes the resurrection ship battle in the stars maybe one of the greatest SF action sequences of all time that would even make Kubrik's eyes go wide open. The real stars of the show are the screenwriters. It is their boat and they are taking us on what appears to be a voyage unparallel to anything else you have seen before.

BSG Season 2 keeps up the post-9/11 brain candy. The writers sometimes jab at the Bush administration foreign and war policies and then again seem to back them up. In Season 1 it was about the constant search for fossil fuels and battling for control of resources while freedoms get restricted in the fight against terrorism, modelling our own political struggles. In Season 2 its politics coupled with colonization.

The interesting religious confrontation involving polytheism (the human belief system in BSG) and monotheism (the Cylon belief system) has extended and even crosses over. The afterlife, or something like it, begins to emerge.

Season 2 is mostly about finding Earth, the Cyclon resurrection ship, elections, hybridizing and colonization. If you are a fan of SF or just high-quality television, then nothing should be holding you back. BSG could very well be the most important SF TV since Star Trek. It certainly has propelled itself out of this world and is in a dimension all of its own... except when Cylons appear.",1203897600,3,4382,4.785714285714286
2429629,5,B000BNI90Y,"Most people would be slightly weary of the idea of a new and re-invigorated version of the spectacle Science Fiction Drama series Battlestar Galactica (1978-1980) being up to the year in which the series became 'Galactica 1980', which lead to its thoroughly trashed downfall, was a bit of a surprise that a network had decided to re-fashion the show with a more updated and far more interesting story. Many fans would, should insist that this is a re-imagining not an intrinsic remake of a cheesy lovable, and to use a pun for a modern show, ""That 70's Show"". Many of the sci-fi fan-boys, and girls, were in need of a successful sci-fi drama series that had the ability to keep fresh interest and action with drama to top.

The show comes from that concept of a 2003 mini-series, a somewhat thorough and enjoyable close to 3 hr pilot. The principal point, machines are made by man, evolved, rebelled, and a war began.

Sci-fi rubbed off on this show, and it pays to respect it with homage's. With elements from novelist Philip K. Dick from his earlier works of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" now known as the film adaptation ""Blade Runner"" along with the dark twisted parallel of the humanoid Cylons, and that mirrored `skinjob' reference. It also manages to match the dark allegory of P. K Dick' ""Valis"" a unique exploration of plethora's and universal metaphysics.

The virtuous and glamoured imagery bears the likeness of Kubrick' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with cross-cut scenes of Baseships in the sunlight of a nearby star, with a score to match. The score itself is very cinematic, in that it mixes and mingles with the imagery of the show to great exertion; continuously trying new techniques and new ways to give the eye candy. The score feels very dark, operatic and at the same time very tautly tense; it again has mirrored Vangelis' score in ""Blade Runner"" with the deep drum sound to hard hitting acoustics.

Battlestar Galactica is the best character drama that has the real dexterity of raw emotion; the acting shapes plot and vice versa. The characters are flawed and they should be, the situation creates the drama and evidently shapes the characters actions. It perhaps is the only show to bludgeon the scene with taut and well crafted dialogue and sharpest whit, measured writing that current shows like LOST and Heroes could benefit from. The dialogued scenes are spot on quality, the actors all themselves have unique range; perhaps currently the best acting troupe on TV. They have unique ability to play different parts of their personas during the course of a single episode, and still bring a sense of morality, logic and whit to the role; very much unlike a ""space opera"".

The acting troupe has characters including Edward James Almos' brilliant depiction of Commander/Admiral Adama; easily being a favourite. His slightly depressed attitude yet experience make him capable, if not slightly down heartened. His display as a commander of the pride of the fleet does show why he is the best person to have control of a superior vessel. He is quick to think, act and knowing what the cost is with the troubles of his confounded life. Two other characters change form and gender, the two now female, where the Galactica predecessor had two male characters, (when fans should not complain) Katee Sackhoff as Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, is born into the role of a hard-headed female Viper pilot. As well as the other female candidate played by Grace Park nicknamed 'Boomer'.

One thing this show does well is giving the most unexpected outcome possible, real credit to the writers that show they have a lot of grenades to go certain ways and that their bold spontaneity will either be accepted or judge by audiences. The writers of this show are very clever, in that you might think they plan out the show years in advance a la ""Babylon 5"" or ""Lost"" however you could not be more wrong. The show is written by boldly engaging the big issues currently on TV. You wonder how does a rag-tag fleet survive in the most logical and pragmatic way, scripted to show you that the real evidence of this is present in stories inspired by recent history and current events.

Truth is that many aspects of futuristic life may well be reflected on the current stand stead of today's socio-political and ethical conflict, that's if we decide to create robots that want to kill us. The themes themselves also reflect the big issues: drama, love, personal betrayal, post-9/11 parables, death, rape, murder, greed, religious extremism, depravity and also the antonyms when the situation lightens up (there is humour). In addition, unremittingly keeps putting forth the notion of what is exactly human. It's about genocide, war and the abyss after the precipice.

The special effects are not the only thing that shows high production value, it would put some of the current Trek franchise to shame. Everything is luscious, from the pure spot-on script and unexpected plots to the character actions and the big explosions going on outside.
The imagery splits from sporadic to perpetual, the effects are full of ardour CGI and digital FX, 'in the mind of the pilot/documentary' shot sequences. The new breed of improved and scary Terminator influenced Cylon centurions and human-looking Cylon infiltrators who's brutal degradation towards mankind reflects the worst parts of humanity. Is it pure hate, spite, jealousy or maybe because they have found a god to kill for; sound familiar? Moreover, what you have been waiting for, yes it does have graphic scenes of a sexual nature, but it's not for everyone.

The plot lines are stupid to the limit. The people act like Italian Puppet theater figurines. Considering that the whole existense of humanity is under peril, the military and civil authorities on the ship are acting like a bunch of hysterical kids whose motto one minute is ""Let's all trust each other till we die"" and the other ""Let's all die before we have to take that difficult and tragic decision"". Being a long time SF fan, I would have never imagined that a SF series could bore half to death.

2429632,5,B000BNI90Y,"I'm rating this on the content of the show, not the marketing tactics (which are kind of a rip-off). Simply put, Battlestar Galactica is the most amazing show I have ever seen. And the first half of season 2 probably contains some of the strongest episodes of the entire series. Even when not much happens in an episode, they were still done so well, that it's incredibly enjoyable to watch. Highlights include:

Scattered: The aftermath of the season 1 finale, although the effects of the catastrophes don't get resolved tidily, but instead tie into the rest of the season.
Valley of Darkness: One of the most exciting episodes, incredibly directed and well done. Some amazing scenes here that are really gut-wrenching.
The Resistance: A great twist, and new characters introduced.
The Farm: An amazingly well done episode, introduces a very intriguing character (who I think should have been in it more after). Also, lots of background for Kara Thrace.
Home (Parts 1 and 2): This is a truly wonderful two parter, I could list tons of scenes that really moved me (end of Home Part 1 anyone?)
Pegasus: One of the best episodes of the series, introducing the Cain arc (which is Battlestar at it's FINEST). The epitome of why this show is great. The ending of the episode will leave you shocked.

I pretty much just listed the entire set. But the first half of season 2 has a consistency in quality that the rest of the sets don't have, and that is why it stands out. The second half of season 2 has some of the best episodes, but also a few episodes that don't live up to Battlestar standards. This set has none of those episodes, every episode is amazing, including ones that I did not list. Buy this set (after watching season 1 of course).",1200355200,2,1741,4.631067961165049

as for the show itself, it is really great and well written, but I hope its own success don't be responsible for turning it into an endless soap opera of unumerable seasons... I hope the show lasts no more than five seasons (four would be enough!).

The show, thanks, is a lot different from LOST. Although there are a lot of mysteries and plot arcs to be solved, in general each episode reach a conclusion on their own. ""LOST"", on the other way, is clearly just a money-making machine intended to reap the money of blind fans for as many seasons as it could.

In their sophomore effort, the show's creators took some real risks, dividing the cast for the first several episodes and putting the lead, Edward James Olmos, effectively out of operation (after being shot by a Cylon operative disguised as a human being). This allowed the show to put more of a spotlight on some of the characters that had been less throughly developed during the first season, and also to shift them to some unusual circumstances. President of the Colonies (Mary McDonnell) has been put in the brig for working against the military's interests; Lt. Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) has been sent on a mission to the devastated world of Caprica to find a sacred artifact that may be necessary for finding the way back to earth, and meets up with the lost Helo (Tahmoh Penicott) and his love, the Cylon turncoat Sharon (Grace Park); and Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) has assumed control of the Galactica after Commander Adama (Olmos) has been shot and institutes martial law on the fleet. These new circumstances allows some fine new work on deepening some of the characters that had seemed more thinly drawn in the previous season, particularly for McDonnell and Park. (Keep your eye also on the superb work done by Alessandro Juliani in the comparatively smaller role of Lt. Gaeta.)

The show suffers a bit in  focus by having the characters so scattered in the early episodes. This separation has its payoff, however, when the characters reunite midway through the set, a genuinely affecting moment validates the comparisons many have elsewhere made of these contemporary densely plotted complex cable dramas to the nineteenth-century multiplot blockbuster novels of the Victorians. Unfortunately there is substantially less humor this season than previously, in part because the character of Dr. Baltar (the fine James Callis), although this also means we are spared too many of his previously interminable scenes with his fantasy of the dead Cylon Number Six (Tricia Helfer). There are notable guest appearances in this set by Lucy Lawless, who sadly is mired in the weakest and most unbelievable of the season's episodes, and Michelle Forbes, who is featured in one of the season's best shows as the self-righteous and ruthless commander of another battlestar discovered by the fleet. The show's special effects are absolutely first rate, and even allow for real moments of beauty which are often sadly and surprisngly lacking in science fiction series: there's a gorgeous long shot in the second episode of a thousand smaller raider ships glittering in sunlight against the darkness of space as they pour out of a Cylon base.

After the Cylons (robots) wipe out almost all of humanity in a sneak attack, the ""Battlestar Galactica"" is the last remaining human warship and leads the few survivors on a search for the mythical Earth. The television show focuses on the President of the Colonies and the military leaders aboard the Galactica. The show has a gritty, realistic, military feel, but despite this, the show is much more than an action/military show: it expertly blends politics, morality, philososphy, and religion into its many plots and focuses on the many characters as they cope with the travails of humanity facing extinction.

Season 2.0 features serious conflicts between the military and civilian leadership that almost erupt into civil war, a return trip to Caprica, religious prophecies fulfilled, and more plot twists involving Cylon agents inside the fleet, and ends with even more drama.

The more isolated episodes begin to feel like ""just"" a TV show sometimes, but never disappoint. BSG is, however, best when the plotlines and themes get so big they spill beyond the bounds of a single episode, or pull together everything that has been developing since the miniseries.

thanks, gang, for a truly terrific show. i feel privileged to watch it.",1174262400,3,777,4.436619718309859
2429654,5,B000BNI90Y,I was afraid the great writing from season 1 would not keep up.  This is BSG with an excellent cast and scripts with real meat on them.

2429656,5,B000BNI90Y,"Captain Adama is not.  This series is awesome in ways that only telepaths may be able to understand.  We normal folk will still get great enjoyment from it until society (or dinosaurs or space creatures) remove us from need.  I'm going to have to continue to watch it a lot in hopes that I will begin to fully understand its greatness.  Maybe this show is a gateway to telepathy?  Or maybe (more importantly) a guide on how to behave when the robots do attack.  (I have my eye on my Roomba and attack it at least once a week to make sure it knows its place).

So watch this show for the knowledge it will give you.  Or for the greatness that it is at television.

With some truly fantastic moments in the first part of season two, these episodes really help bring a new level of spectacular to the show.  The writing, acting, and special effects are all top notch.  It is a sci-fi show that is head and shoulders above the competition.  Other sci-fi shows are really good, but this one is great.",1173312000,3,995,4.318918918918919

Either you buy the dvd's and own the set, rent the show from netflix or blockbuster or simply don't watch the show again.  Either way that's not why I'm reviewing 2.0...sure it's expensive but I'm going to continue to purchase the shows anyways.

Next order of business..what a winking homage to the original series in The Final Cut episode.  I won't give away any spoilers of the plot in the episode but what I will say is the end of the episode playing the theme from the original series brought a tear to my eye. This is what I call a remake without being a remake.  The first time you heard a glimpse of the original main theme was in the pilot mini-series and from that point on you heard the music from mostly either composed by Richard Gibbs or Beary McReary but hold and behold right before Pegasus the 3rd to the last episode of 2.0 set you get a great episode that ends not only with a cliffhanger that sets the tone for the rest of the series but also what a great way they incorporated the main theme from the original series and that alone is worth the purchase of the set alone.  I've decided to not watch the Pegasus version from 2.0 and instead watch the extended from 2.5..but also all the rest of the episodes from the first half of the 2nd season are just absolutely wonderful with the most masterpiece writing of all time.  I'll be hitting 2.5 today and in a few days will be writing the review of it then...now just finding out a way of how I'm going to watch season 3..right now season 3 is about to finish but Sci-fi channel isn't showing the reruns right away so may have to wait a while for that unless universal decides to release season 3 very soon.

Still, considering they're at war and there are only 50,000 or so humans left, it makes sense. S1, the first half of S2, and the first three episodes of S3 are five-star quality (the first episode of the show won a Hugo); the rest I would give four or three stars. Each season has its one requisite godawful episode. Watch it and move on.

BSG has its tragically flawed characters, its horrifyingly awful situations, and several different shades of gray to be sorted every episode. It's something between Shakespeare and a philosophy debate, with a little soap opera weighing down the middle. I can't say ""buy it,"" because everyone has their own taste.

It's one of the most gritty and realistic TV space operas going. BSG 2.0 like S1 is a credit to the Canadians. This one is right up there with the best along with Taken and Firefly/Serenity.

Some find the mix of futuristic technology such as faster than light drive and things we're used to (bullets, bombs, missiles, trucks with internal combustion engines a might disconcerting (are some too inculcated with zap bang SciFi?) but to me this serves the series well and enhances BSG's originality.

S2.0 flawlessly picks up where S1 left off dealing with the twin crisis of Commander Adama's near death and the survivors of the Kobol expedition battling Cylons and incompetent leadership on Kobol. This gives S2.0 the foundation to further develop the shows characters both human and cylon in parallel with epic space battles and the other features that made Season 1 the hit it was.

Even with a few noticeable plot faults (where do all those replacement Vipers, missiles, bombs & bullets keep coming from?), it's got the full menu of twists, turns, plots and sub-plots that a show needs to keep up and improve on the standards that S1 set. BSG S2.0 has strong spiritual themes that are subtle enough to get one thinking of what might just be.

I could go on and on but everyone else has already written good things so I won't repeat them.

My only complaint is that season 2 is split in half for DVD sales, clearly to make a profit under the guise of saying, ""Look, you don't have to wait for the first 10 episodes to be released, we did it for you!"". How convenient for us. The combined price of Seasons 2.0 and ""2.5"" is $69 for 20 hour-long episodes. Compare this to another series such as Alias where an entire season (22 episodes, each an hour long as well) goes for $46. I don't understand why they are punishing their loyal fan base (the main reason why the show has made it this far) by artificially inflating prices.

The obvious counter-argument is that nobody made me buy anything, true! I also admit that I will buy future ""split seasons""...but I will be shaking/clenching my fist at the computer screen when I do it.",1168300800,4,1067,4.466666666666667
2429670,5,B000BNI90Y,"This is my first review of an episodic television show so I'm going to be as harsh as possible...Where I can!

To let you all know I am not a fan of the original Battlestar Galactic...in fact a lot of night time shows were missed, as I was busily being an employee and a student. I did see a few shows but was immediately turned off with the introduction of the ""monkey in the dog suit"" and the little kid....

Now I also understand that this BSG is a ""re-imagining"" of the original but we will address that issue later....

I've rated this BSG so high and here are my reasons why:

#1 -  Believable Characters

We, earthlings, are not yet on the run for our lives but the show properly portrays what some us would do if there was a way to escape our world's devastation.

The characters go to and physically have restrooms! (Oy, this coming from a Trekker!)

People also have ""potty mouths"" so frak this!

#2 - The stories deal with real moral issues

How do we deal with an enemy that looks, feels, a reacts like us?

How do we deal with finding out the person you thought you knew or loved was the enemy?

How do we deal with issues involving love, dishonesty, family?

Gee, this week's loss of pilots and vipers  is a loss of pilots and vipers!!!! ( No mysterious regeneration of pilots and vipers)

#3 - Believable technology

Being a science-fiction lover...the technology is believable in that it does have connections to what is in the realm of the real world...atomic warheads, the Galactica's layout, pilot's bunks, closing doors between rooms and sections etc. Oh, don't forget resources that run out!

Lastly the way the show is filmed. I really love the semi-documentary style of filming. The realty of  the scene is really enhanced and the viewer feels like they are a part of the action, not just the ""fly-on-the-wall""....

To finish, I have heard a lot of the older fans wishing to ""ban"" this version of their beloved show...Call it my Trekker attitude but it would be illogical fro them to do this as this ""reimagined"" version is actually very much like the classic version....The classic had an episode concerning running out of water...the classic had an episode  about running out of fuel...the classic had  an episode of a ""sharpshooter Cyclon"".....the classic had Apollo dating a ""lady of the evening""...the classic had a two-parter concerning another Battlestar (Pegasus)..the classic had the word ""frack"" and other vocabulary in it....the unfortunate thing about the classic was it was told in an ""80's"" form and although they did their best the actors, writers, directors of that time were restricted to that ages television morality laws and formula on shooting an episodic show...

Nowadays, there is a greater audience request for more realism in the shows

Fortunately for us this is a show that is syndicated which means bigger and better plots (Is Gaius mad or controlled by a chip - this has not yet been resolved) much more better special effects and more attention to detail by the writers and producers (Let's face it, they have to feed their families too!) who want this show to be successful and lastly, television channels willing to take a chance on story plots about rape, racism, honesty, and faith.

characters. Wow! I'm completely hooked! If you haven't seen BSG and you love

a good show, buy season one, season 2.0 and 2.5. It's well worth the money,

I promise!",1167955200,2,462,4.858974358974359
2429672,4,B000BNI90Y,"This first half of the 2nd season of the new BSG ramps things up, bravely going where other sci-fi franchises fear to tread.  The first 10 episodes set up several plot threads with varying degrees of success, culminating in the appearance of ""Battlestar Pegasus"".  Regardless of how much of the new season's energy is just carried over from last season, the first 10 eps. of Season 2 remain consistently unmissable.

Season One ended with the few surviving colonials discovering the fabled world of Kobol, which legend claims points the way to Earth.  Though first hinting at fabled Earth as their salvation (""So Say We ALL!!"") Commander Adama proves to have little use for the legend of Earth, and even less belief.  His better half, President Laura Roslin, seems about as pragmatic as Adama is, yet soon embraces the legend as much as Adama doesn't.  Her disease worsening, Laura sees visions on satellite photos of Kobol - is it the disease, or a sign from above?  Season 2 opens with Adama near death after being shot by Boomer - who has learned the truth of her Cylon identity.  Never wanting ultimate command, Col. Tigh exercises it with disastrous severity in ""The Old Man's"" absence. Starbuck, marooned on Caprica, links up with resistance there.  A squad of colonial marines barely holds it own while surrounded by Cylon centurions on Kobol.  Gaius Baltar, the traitor who unwittingly touched off the Cylon onslaught of the colonies, struggles to understand his link to the Cylon Six - a dilemma that will see him suffer the fate of all traitors: to fear betrayal from every side.

Following the lead of the first season, the first half of season two is a welcome mix of standalone stories & extended plot ideas.  Besides the running arcs above, we've also got Kamikaze Cylons and their viruses, the ""Tomb of Athena"", machinations of Tom Zarek, and Six makes a surprise appearance on Galactica - to everybody else.  It's a miracle that the writers manage to skillfully and effectively juggle these different plot threads, continuing to work in post 9/11 angst into the handling of Cylon prisoners and the growing rifts among the dwindling numbers of survivors.  As before, the new BSG remains effective sci-fi, using great dialog, acting and minimal use of technobabble.

It is one of the best written shows on television right now, the plot is gripping, and the chcracters are much grittier and more realistic than on many other utopian sci-fi shows. I have seen it dubbed ""The Sci-fi series for people who hate sci-fi"" by at least one critic.

The show is not affraid to examine many contemporary issues in the guise of fiction, and it shies away from easy answers. Although there are villians and antagonists throughout, one of the most endearing features of the show is the way these roles can change and shift over time. There are certainly times when the viewer is not sure who is right and who they want to win.

This first half of season 2 is as good as all of the season 1 stories.  Not a weak link in any of the 10 episodes.  The fact that the Richard Hatch from the original show makes infrequent appearances as ""Tom Zarek"" is proof he knows, this show is something truly special.

When you step back a moment, the show is VERY contemporary, because there's an episode that deals with highly lethal computer viruses, which cripple infrastructure.  Thus, the combat is within the characters and the technology.

Yeah, I'll be getting Season 2.5, but I wouldn't be surprised to see seasons 2.0 and 2.5 merged into a boxed set if this show is re-released under HD-DVD/Blu-Ray.  The producer, Ron Moore DID say this show was recorded in HD, and knowing Hollywood, I think it's very possible this will get a ""visual upgrade"" in the future.

The only ""quirk"" I found is that on one episode Chief Tyrol commonly refers to Lieutenant Crashdown as ""LT"", which is common in the military.  However, the subtitles mistakenly read, ""El-Tee"", so I'm thinking the person (or people) who created the subtitles didn't realize that.

Regarding the DVD, it's a great opportunity to get into the show if you haven't been watching it regularly.  The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that it isn't complete.

2429697,4,B000BNI90Y,"As if there weren't enough cliffhangers at the end of the first season, another one is thrown in the mix to complicate matters.  We start with Adama being in critical condition, a team is stranded on Kobol, and Starbuck is back on Caprica with Helo and another Sharon while looking for an arrow.  Then a jump ends with the rest of the fleet, including the doctor, being sent somewhere other than where Galactica ends up.  It takes several episodes to wind all of these things up which technically make it the slowest part of the season in terms of time passing in the series.

Somehow things get even worse in the fleet under Ty's rule while the president is incarcerated.  But eventually Adama gets the doctor he needs and his perspective is enough to begin putting the pieces back together again.  It is not easy, there are no simple solutions, and that helps make it more believable and more dramatic.  The Kobol plot thread draws to a conclusion although the Caprica plot continues into the second half of the season.  This first half ends with another tribute to the original series when another Battlestar, the Pegasus, is encountered.  But this is handled much better than in the original series and end in a way that you really want to plow right into season 2.5.

Some of the deleted scenes form the first episodes really put a better understanding on what is going on and gives a real history to the relationship between Adama and Ty.  Throughout this half of the season the writing remains tight and the drama solid.  We even get to see another little dose of reality when the Chief decides to start manufacturing and not just repairing.  All in all a wonderful series that remains strong and true while not skimping on the plots or action.  Definitely check it out.",1161043200,3,1777,4.635782747603834
2429698,4,B000BNI90Y,"I have waited patiently until the release of the second half of Season 2 to buy this ""2.0"" set, comprising of the first 10 episodes of the show's second season, hoping in vain for a better whole season package or a cheaper bundle deal. Alas, we didn't get either of those, and I would wait no longer.

This first half of the season is certainly a strong one, perhaps even the best bunch of Battlestar Galactica episodes you could buy on DVD as of now. However, you'll definitely not share that same sentiment if you aren't already familiar with Season 1 and the story so far, and you'll most likely be interested in the second half of Season 2 as well. Thus I'd not recommend buying Season 2.0 unless you already have bought, or are willing to buy the Season 1 and Season 2.5 sets as well, or if you can watch those via other means. There is no great need to go into details about the show's story-line then -- if you liked the first season, you are going to enjoy this one much the same.

Beyond this, there's not much to say about this set. It's got what's expected: OK video and sound quality, English and Spanish subtitles, Ron Moore's podcast commentaries which were already published previously on the web when the episodes aired on TV, plus some deleted scenes. Those deleted scenes are also freely available on SciFi's website, and are quite uninteresting, not a loss that they were cut. In the end I feel a bit shortchanged by the amount of bonus features. A featurette or two would have been welcome, particularly as there's plenty of space to spare on the last, third disc. Interviews, bloopers, behind the scenes, something. This is reason two why I'm only giving this set 4 stars, reason one being the cutting of the season into two separate releases.

As a footnote, there apparently are complete Season 2 sets available in other markets, such as the Region 2 PAL release you could order from Amazon's UK subsidiary. After accounting for the currency exchange, shipping costs, discounts etc. however, I realized it would not be any cheaper than buying both half-seasons here.",1160784000,4,2089,4.640540540540541

The original Battlestar Galactica was before my time, but I've fallen in love with this version because of the complicated characters and interesting, winding plotlines. Unlike Star Trek's squeaky clean characters, many of BSG's players are unapologetically flawed, which makes for engaging and superbly entertaining television.

Emotional, Raw, Realistic, Gritty, Edgy, Young, Exciting. Impeccably written, acted, filmed. Strong women and minority characters make this a fully fleshed, totally realized show. This is some of the best sci-fi made for TV or movie.

Battlestar's portrayal of a military organization under stress, a community in desperation, a society thrown into total disorder is fascinating and right on. Not preachy, apolitical, and not afraid to delve deeply into all human relationships (both personal and institutional), it breaks all stereotypes - this show is a gem in the rough of today's TV wasteland.

It's attention to dramatic action and its penchant for piercing social commentary should not be lost in its science fiction roots. If this show were part of any other genre - crime drama, sitcom, miniseries - both Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonell would have surely been nominated for Emmys, along with the writers and cinematographers.

I hope this series is long lived. I know it is much loved by it's fans and critics.

2429701,5,B000BNI90Y,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is simultaneously one of the most celebrated and one of the most reviled shows in the history of television Sci-fi, a distinction that I regard with a sense of bafflement.  The original 1978 series has never been enjoyed a high reputation among either serious Sci-fi fans or among television critics of any stripe, yet a surprisingly large number of devotees have reacted with abject hatred to the new version of the series.  A smaller number of STAR TREK fans also hate it, since in many ways the revived BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is the anti-STAR TREK.  As far as fans of the original show go, I have very little to say.  There is simply no way in which the earlier show was in any way truly a good show, while the new one in virtually every way a truly great one.  The original would not rank in the top ten (and perhaps not the top 20) of the best Sci-fi shows ever, while the current BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is one of the best shows ever made regardless of genre.  The debate between the new versus the old version of the show is ludicrous.

The disaffected STAR TREK fans, however, goes to the heart of how BATTLESTAR GALACTICA differs from most prior Sci-fi series.  The truth is that STAR TREK has had far more influence on the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA than the earlier show did, though the influence was entirely in terms of how creator Ron Moore (and STAR TREK alumni) wanted his show to differ from the STAR TREK shows.  The differences are manifold.  STAR TREK features aliens; BATTLE STAR GALACTICA does not, though it does have robots.  The Enterprise and all other space ships on the show have shields; neither Galactica nor any other ship has anything approximating a shield (you never hear a character yelling, ""Shields down to 20 %!"").  Weapons on STAR TREK emit pulses or rays; weapons on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA throw projectiles.  Crew members don't fight on STAR TREK; much of the action on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA surrounds interpersonal conflicts and struggles among crew members.  If a crew member gets stranded on a planet's surface on STAR TREK, they are beamed out; if a crew member gets stranded in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA they only survive if someone goes and gets them.  On STAR TREK there is a magical reserve of everything, including smaller ships, equipment, fuel, and whatever; on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA they run out of crucial supplies, including fuel, water, food, and aircraft.  On STAR TREK if someone is hurt you hold a healing beam over them and in a few minutes they are healed; if someone injures a knee on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, it takes weeks of healing and therapy to get over it.  On STAR TREK none of the characters have serious personal problems; on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA characters struggle with depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, anger, sexual promiscuity, and a host of other problems.  STAR TREK is famously optimistic about the future; BATTLESTAR GALACTICA struggles with the issue about whether the human race can survive and even whether it has a right to survive.  On STAR TREK characters rarely make major mistakes; on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA even the strongest characters are flawed and make both errors of morality and errors of judgment.  And none of this begins to get at the enormous difference in the narrative strategies of the two shows.  For the most part the STAR TREK shows are episodic in structure (this is certainly true of the original series as well as STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION; both STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE 9 and STAR TREK: VOYAGER mixed some serial elements into the shows, though they still largely adhered to the episodic form).  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, however, is serial in structure, leaving a large amount of conflict unresolved each week and telling a long, involved story that only gradually reveals itself.

There is one more difference between BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and both the original version and the various STAR TREK series:  the latter shows appeal to people who are fans of Sci-fi television, while BATTLESTAR GALACTICA appeals more to those who love quality television, regardless of genre.  There are people who will love nearly every Sci-fi show, while there are others who will love only Sci-fi shows that would be loved even by non-Sci-fi fans.  My own tastes lie somewhere in between.  I can go as far as LEXX or ANDROMEDA, but I love a show like STARGATE SG-1.  But while I would not rank SG-1 among the best shows on TV, not up there with BUFFY, SIX FEET UNDER, LOST, or VERONICA MARS, I easily rank BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with any show ever made.

Season One ended and Season Two began with almost everything on the show as shattered as it was possible for things to be.  Adama had been shot by Sharon when her sleeper programming kicked in.  Tigh had taken command and managed to make a string of bad decisions.  Starbuck is back on Caprica to recover an object crucial for finding the way to earth.  The Sharon on Caprica has gone away to protect her baby when it is obvious to her that Starbuck may kill her.  Laura is in jail after Adama imprisoned her and declared martial law.  Apollo is in the brig because he sided with Laura and opposed his father.  Season Two would end just as messed up, but I kept thinking in early Season Two whether Humpty Dumpy could put everything back together again.  The plotlines that are developed in the first ten episodes of Season Two are uniformly superb.  Over and over when watching these episodes I kept thinking:  TV is just not supposed to be this good.  Eventually Adama comes out of his coma and recovers slowly from his wounds.  The Sharon on Galactica is shot and killed while the Sharon on Caprica returns and not only rescues Kara and Lelo there but goes with them to Kobol where she proves crucial in finding the path to earth.  Adama reconciles with Laura and repledges his support of a civilian-led government.  And the half season ends with the unexpected appearance of the Pegasus, a battlestar commanded by Admiral Helena Cain, who is magnificently portrayed by Michelle Forbes.  The half season ends with Adama relinquishing command of the fleet to the overbearing and dictatorial Cain.

As great as the show was in Season One, it just kept getting better and better in Season Two as it continually tried to push to the limits what it was possible not merely to do in television Sci-fi but in television in general.  There were just so many fascinating and riveting plotlines and conflicts.  The character of Sharon got a lot of development in the season.  I love the metaphysical and existential complexity of her character.  The Galactica Sharon shot Adama without being aware that she was doing so and was fully committed to a conscious level to the humans.  The Caprica Sharon was aware that she was a Cylon, yet in a scene that precisely aped the other Sharon's attempt to assassinate Adam, made a fully self-consciousness decision to side with the humans.  Her character would later safe Galactica from a Cylon attack fleet and would provide the catalyst for the split between Adama and Laura on the one side and Cain on the other when a Pegasus ""interrogator"" would attempt to traumatize Sharon by raping her.  Because both of the two Sharons who have been involved with Galactica have the capacity for resurrection, I suspect that her character will continue to be one of the most fascinating aspects of the show.  Again, many fans of the original show hate this Boomer, but anyone who finds the original in any way a more interesting character really needs to reevaluate.

I have only one complaint about these DVDs and it is one that I'm sure is shared by a host of fans of the show:  the cost.  This is probably the most expensive DVD set I have ever bought.  Even for my very favorite shows if the cost is over $40 for a season I will usually skip buying it and will instead just keep renting from Netflix.  But I'll end up paying just under $70 for Season Two.  The price is steep indeed and I would very much have preferred having all of Season Two in a single package.  At least the set is rich in commentaries and special features.  The only reason I bit the bullet and dropped the bucks for this was the fact that this is one of my three favorite shows on TV (along with LOST and VERONICA MARS) and I want to do all I can to support it.  I have a gut feeling that Season Three will be the last (though I hope we'll see a Season Four).  Because Universal produces the show, makes the DVDs, and owns the Sci-fi Channel, renewal isn't impossible.  So, perhaps we will see a Season Four.  However much of this show we get, it clearly has established itself as not merely the finest Sci-fi series ever made, but one of the best shows as well.",1158019200,6,8713,4.686390532544379
2429702,5,B000BNI90Y,"While most series fail to recapture the second time around what attracted audiences in the first season, Battlestar succeeds.

2429704,5,B000BNI90Y,"This DVD set of Battlestar Galactica (the new series) encompasses the first 10 episodes of the second season. It was released before the second half of the second season aired on TV.

As some people have noted, the last episode ""Pegasus"" is not the 60+ minute special episode.

So, you could have watched this on TV, and you could still be TiVo/taping it at 2AM showings. So why buy the DVD? Well, the recordings of the podcasts with Ron Moore et al are fun to listen to. Being able to watch the whole series end-to-end without commercials or intervening weeks is more than worth the price of buying the DVDs. And there's just something about owning it.

Here is where I'm supposed to convince people that BSG is a great series that should be watched by everyone. Really, if you don't want to watch it because you don't like SF, because you think that killer robots and interstellar travel are unrealistic, nothing that I say here is going to convince you otherwise. This series is, however, one of the best on TV. The drama is gritty and more realistic and heartfelt than anything on network TV. It's more on the lines of ""Nip/Tuck"" or ""Rescue Me"" than ""Star Trek."" The cast is phenomenal. The acting is better than most other dramas, and part of that is because the writing is so good. Good actors with good material makes this show.

On Nip/Tuck every week, I always cover my open mouth with my hand and exclaim, ""I can't believe they did that [on TV.]"" When I'm watching BSG, I forget I'm watching TV. It's so engrossing that it's more like reading a book or living through it.

2429705,5,B000BNI90Y,"Season 1 of Battlestar Galactica was fantastic.  The first 10 episodes of Season 2 takes this show to a whole new level.  All of the elements that made Season 1 so good are back, and then some!

Aside from a few other shows out there, I dare anyone to find a television show that has more rich and compelling stories from one episode to another.  There is no lull.  It doesn't drop off, or take an episode ""off"" after one that has been especially intense.

Also, there are no ""accidents"" or special effects thrown in for the sake of putting in an action sequence just to keep you interested in the story.  There is a reason for everything that happens in these stories.  Two Cylon Raiders appear to be closing in to attack the Galactica.  Older and less sophisticated shows may have placed this part in for the sake of an action sequence.  Not here.  There is a reason for it that is an integral part of the story.

One of the best things about Battlestar Galactica is that it reveres the intelligence of its viewers.  They don't play down to you.  They know there might be a bit of lingo, or something going on in a scene that you might not get right off.  That's okay.  They trust that you will be able to put the pieces together and trust the reasoning behind what's going on in the story.  Instead of starting you off with a 500-piece puzzle, it's like starting you off with a 5,000 or even 10,000 piece puzzle.  They know you'll get it.  What's better, is that a show like this is perfect on DVD because it invites repeated viewings where you will find things you may have missed or overlooked the first time out.

The pacing of the show is quick.  The camera shots are short and fast, especially during a combat sequence.  The confusion is intentional, as the writers and directors want you to feel the way the characters feel.

Season 2 starts off just after Boomer has shot Commander Adama.  The first 4 episodes cover his struggle to survive.  This brings me to another great detail about this show.  Everything takes time.  You don't watch one episode where someone was hurt, and boom, they're suddenly healed in the next because several weeks have probably gone by.  No, here the scars and wounds stay their course.

The power struggle between Adama and Tigh continues with President Roslin, whom they believe has lost her mind to religious fantacisim.  She's determined to go to Kobol and find the Tomb of Athena which may have clues to how to find Earth.  The episode where they enter this tomb is awesome, and I won't say any more about it here.

Starbuck has her struggles on Caprica as she recovers the Arrow of Apollo, but is left with the question of how to get back to the fleet.

Then one of the most compelling story-lines continues, which concerns Sharon ""Boomer"" Valeri.  By now, everyone in the fleet knows she's a Cylon.  How does one deal with that?  This is handled from the perspective of most of the key characters.  Eventually, it asks the question concerning ""living"" and ""non-living"" things.  Although she's a Cylon, can she feel?  Can she feel and give love?  What separates the ""man/woman"" from the ""machine?""  Or, is she simply manipulating everyone?  This is one question alone which invites the viewer to keep coming back for more!

Season 2.0 ends with the first part of ""Pegasus,"" which takes off loosely from the first series, where the Galactica and her crew stumbles upon the Battlestar Pegasus, commanded by Admiral Helena Cain.  Cain has her own views of how to run the fleet, and since she out-ranks Adama, she has complete authority in all military matters, including how she feels Cylon prisoners should be handled.  Only after finally challenging her authority, does the makings of a huge combat fight in space between two Battlestars threaten to take place.  What happens next?

Unfortunately, I, and everyone else, has to wait for Season 2.5 to find out what does happen next.  And right now, even a day is an extremely long wait!

In the meantime, I hope you are enjoying this sophisticated piece of story-telling as much as I am.  AFI has already ranked Battlestar Galactica as one of the best television shows.",1155859200,7,4163,4.612551159618008

2429710,3,B000BNI90Y,"It's an odd place in which my wife and I find ourselves.  We're hooked on the show, but why?  The characters, all in all, are rather stock and predictable.  Ditto the stories and writing, which we've repeatedly predicted as the episodes unfold.  This isn't said to pat ourselves on the back, a ""Woo-hoo, look how clever we are.""  No no.  It frustrates us, actually.  We'd much rather not be able to peg the series as easily as we do, but when the writers consistently take the road most traveled by, stringing cliched character conflicts and dialogue together to such an excessive degree, it's hard not to be exasperated by it.  For all its admittedly excellent production design and decent to good acting, the new incarnation of Battlestar Galactica lacks the originality of the average charm bracelet.  It seems the creators expended their creativity on the ""reimagining"" itself.  I'm sure legions of fans are spit-taking their coffee right now, so I'll use the episode we watched tonight, ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" as an example.

**SPOILER ALERT**

**Stop reading if you don't want to get hit by all the clichs flying about!  Skip down to the ""end spoiler"" alert.**

Okay--we knew that ""Sharon"" the Cylon was going to save the day.  We knew that Adama would be stern and threaten her and still not trust her in the end.  We knew that Tigh (Tighe?) would be  blustery and ineffective until suddenly becoming sober and professional after his weekly admonishment from Adama.  (Which happens only slightly more frequently than his being manipulated by his irritatingly transparent wife.)  We knew that Helo would do something to make the card players who gave him short shrift during the poker game respect him by the end of the episode--and that every card player *would be shown* at the end shaking his hand for it.  Everything must be spelled out and tied up neatly for us simple viewers.  And this is our point: That almost without fail, the writers write to the stereotypes.  Yes, Starbuck as created goes against type, but she's a clich of her own rebellious type.  Of course she was going to offer to fly the new fighter that the chief was building, because she's the ""hot dog"" pilot who's not afraid of anything.  But boy, we were sure kept in suspense when Apollo couldn't make radio contact with her.

** END SPOILER ALERT **

  It's this clich-addled story construction and writing that makes it hard to enjoy the show, because the actors have to react in a realistic way to unrealistically contrived situations.  Which explains why the only time in the twenty-three episodes I've watched that I've felt the slightest lump in my throat was in the twenty-second episode when the original theme song began playing.

And yet we are hooked, and we do know why: We want to know what happens. The basic premise of the show, as it was with the original series, is interesting enough that it keeps us turning the pages, as it were.  The overall quality of the show, particularly this second season, is good enough that we can return to whet our appetite about where the show is going.  But, as with George Lucas' latest Star Wars trilogy, we can't escape the feeling of ""Oh, the opportunity lost.""  The actors on Galactica are better than their material.  We think; perhaps they're not and we're glad they have what they do, but at this rate we'll never know.  This is badly formulaic television at its best.  It's a good thing they've got a great hook.",1154995200,10,3455,4.728643216080402

2429713,5,B000BNI90Y,"I have been reading and watching SF for more than 50 years, so my standards are rather high (IMHO, anyhow...).

I absolutely detested the original series, and I couldn't imagine why anybody would want to bring it back.  Then, the Sci-Fi Channel provided the first episode of series 1 as a free download on iTunes.  I watched because the price was right, and I've been hooked ever since.  I currently spend most of my time in Paris (not that I'm complaining), so the only way I can watch is via iTunes or DVD, but so far it has been worth the effort.

My only complaint about the show is that it gets to be a bit of a soap opera sometimes; the humans seem to spend more time fighting among themselves than they spend fighting the Cylons.  The writers do seem to understand political science (and human nature), so the human conflicts are believable (especially given the current mess the world is in).

As others have pointed out, this is an ""adult"" program; not much black and white, but a lot of shades of grey.  I highly recommend it.",1153872000,2,1036,4.444444444444445

2429732,5,B000BNI90Y,"What an adventure!!! Season 2 starts off with a bang and continues exploding all the way through - until, that is, Universal decided to get a bit greedy.  Harsh, yes, but it seems that they seem to need to make a bit more money by only releasing the first 10 episodes. I know that 'cliff-hangers' are spellbinding and makes for part of the viewing excitement but this is a bit much. This new ""Battlestar Galactica"" series is fantastic, they've gone all out to create a brilliant show - it has everything!  So does Smallville, released by Warner Brothers. WB, in my opinion, is doing it right by releasing the whole season at once! I don't live in America right now and find that waiting for the whole season to be released is part of the 'thrill-of-waiting'. Ok, I might be one of a kind, since most want everything 'now' and don't mind paying extra to have it - yet some of us need to watch our budgets. Season 2.0 Vol. 1 has excellent acting, intriguing story lines - including drama, some comedy, romance, special effects, and adventure!  What more could anyone want? All in all Season 2.0 Vol. 1 heightens the viewing senses and I must give this show, as I do Smallville, a 5 star rating!",1151884800,,1192,4.483870967741935

Character development, multiple storylines, strong themes and compelling moral dilemmas abound in this series, which I believe would have wide mainstream appeal (not just limited to Sci-Fi junkies).  It's surprising to me that this hasn't been picked up by one of the main networks, and even more surprising that it hasn't gotten as much publicity as it deserves.

2429744,4,B000BNI90Y,"Try it, you'll like it.
I never was much of a Sci-Fi fan.  I had a hard time accepting most of the contrived underlying premises that one had to assume in order to, ""go with it.""  The real world is more my cup of tea.  Plausibility is almost an absolute necessity for my enjoyment of anything that follows.  If not for this series and my reading of the various reviews, the tone of which led me to try one more presumably thin premise, I would not have known what I was missing.
This series, ""Battlestar Galactica,"" is so different for me, and maybe for you, too.  First of all, the storyline could be told in any setting from the old west to modern war stories.  That resonant theme is the crux of the availability for me to enjoy all of it.  Now, even the unusual setting has become so curiously unique to my taste buds I actually really like it.  I got Firefly, the series and Serenity.  The same superior enjoyment erupted.  I am a very satisfied convert to the genre so much so that it is to the point that I now need no plausible underlying set of necessarily logical premises anymore.  What a change, and this series did it.  The 4400?  A bit too unsolvable still for my taste.  The Dead Zone?  I can now accept the unrealistic premise, because of Battlestar.
I have never been one that could watch things more than once, even stuff I liked.  But I can put BG in the DVD player anytime, anywhere and at any point of time in the series story.  The series is a very pleasant surprise.  Isn't that Starbuck the baddest b**** in space?!  Even though the main storyline is universal the actual stories within it are very unique and original.  A lot of thought, blood, sweat and tears have been put into this series by a lot of talented people.",1151280000,6,1745,4.343653250773994
2429745,4,B000BNI90Y,"As a non-cable subscriber, I have really begun to love this series from the DVDs.  It's a little difficult when they release season 1 and half of season 2.

In season 2 vol 1 we get into the characters more and learn more about the society that had been the 12 colonies of Kobol.  Some memorable moments are:

- Cheif Tyrol decides he's tired of losing Vipers one at a time and designs and constructs a new model.

- Col. Tigh tries to take over after Adama is shot, but his personality flaws make matters much worse.

- The Boomer Swapperoo: Cali gets a Cylon kill (not bad for a deck mechanic).

- ""Kobol-henge""

This is Sci-Fi TV at it's best.  The stories are tense, serious, and funny (in spots) and I definitely will be buying any season they care to put out.  The commentaries and deleted scenes are good, but I wish they would have released the entire second season rather than splitting it up.

If you like Sci-Fi (some might say ""space-opera"") then you need this series.  What are you waiting for?",1150156800,5,1007,4.413043478260869
2429746,5,B000BNI90Y,"This is the best show on TV right now. Maybe the best Sci-Fi show ever. If you are a sci-fi fan, this is a must-see show. If not, you should still consider checking this out. Yes, it is in space and yes, it has killer robots, yet even with that, the depth of human drama is comparable to anything on TV today.

Last season, the 12 Colonies of Kobol were nearly blown away by the Cylons, machines that resemble humans and the old warrior mechanical types. The humans almost ran out of water and fuel, yet somehow manage to survive. This ragtag group of human refugees is in search of a 13th lost tribe of humans on a planet called Earth. Things this season start out badly, and they only get worse.

Both of the leaders of the fleet are incapacitated at the beginning of the season. President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) is in Galactica's brig for inciting Lt. Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) to mutiny which caused the loss of the Cylon Raider that had been captured, which was a valuable military asset. Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos) was shot by ""Boomer"" (Grace Park), who is a Cylon,

The second season here picks up right where the first season left off. However, unlike most TV shows, the problems presented in the Season 1 finale are not resolved in the first episode. Some will take the whole first part of the second season to be resolved.

As we learned in season 1, there are 12 models of Cylons. The question is: is the Raider (ship) and Warrior, unit 2 of the twelve, or are there 12 models that resemble humans? We do have the introduction of 2 new human-form cylon models (bringing the total to 6/8, leaving 6/4 left to be uncovered), and the reappearance of political activist/terrorist Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch, of the original Battlestar Galactica).

A unique feature this season, and one that is a most interesting addition, is a textual representation of how many people are still alive. Each week in the credits, there is a sentence which lists the exact number of survivors, and it changes every week, depending on how many people died (or appeared) the episode before.

In comparison to Season 1 it is hard to say which is better. The 13 episodes of Season 1 were all great. In the first half of Season 2, there are also no bad episodes. Battlestar Galactica season 2 has such powerful episodes as "" Pegasus"" and ""Scattered"". Yet the best episode of the Season 2.0 DVD is "" Valley of Darkness"", which in my opinion is sheer brilliance, and possibly the best episode of the series.

This is one of the best shows on TV right now, according to many media outlets. ""A Breakaway Hit!"" -TV Guide and ""The Best Show on Television."" -Newsday are but two examples of the rave reviews it has received. If you are a sci-fi fan, this is a must-see show. If you aren't a sci-fi fan, you should still consider checking this out. Even though it's in space and has killer robots, it is more human than most other drama shows on TV today. So say we all.

Anyway, for those who haven't seen this show, but you like a good character drama, be sure to check out this show on DVD. I believe it's even better on DVD. Much like Babylon 5, there is a single story line, with multiple story arcs all tying into that one line. So there is continuity between each episode...and unlike Star Trek, they don't hit the reset button between each episode or movie. What's damaged on a ship in one episode stays damaged in following episodes, as the first season takes place just over a 3 month period.

I recognize that this is a compelling drama that just happens to take place in outer space. It deals with many weighty subjects such as genocide, human flaws, paranoia, depression, and religion. The creators of the original 1970's Battlestar Galactica included many Mormons. On the Internet there are hundreds of articles looking at the religious imagery, the Mormon end-time theology. The religion themes are just as powerful in this new series and this series has practicing religious (clergy - faithful believers), visions, a drug to induce religious visions, and the president believes she is to fulfill prophecy and save humanity.

This is possibly the best Sci-fi series ever!

2429748,5,B000BNI90Y,"I like the way the previous reviewer broke it down.

Season 1 is 44.99 for 13 Episodes.  Assuming the mini-series is a bonus since it is necessary for Season 1's back story, it works out to $3.46 per episode.

Season 2.0 is $34.96 for 10 episodes.  That works out to $3.50 per episode.

It may be that Season 2.0 and Season 2.5 will add up to more than the Season 1 set, but there are 20 episodes in Season 2, and Season 1 only had 13!  If the BSG producers are willing to make more episodes for the fans, it will cost the fans more for the extra episodes.  Would the unhappy reviewers prefer to have only 13 episodes in Season 2 so that it would cost the same? I sure wouldn't.

We are being charged virtually the same amount per episode in Season 2.0 as we paid for Season 1.  I think it is worth it for the quality of this show.

Also, I think people who feel ripped off because they bought the mini-series by itself and later got it as part of Season 1 should think a little more.  They don't seem to be increasing the price of Season 1 because it includes the mini-series.  As noted above, we are paying about $3.50 per episode in both Seasons.  Also, it was released 6 months before Season 1.  I realize that people can argue that if they had known, they would have waited 6 months to get it along with Season 1.  I wonder if fans would have waited the 6 months if they had known in advance.

Here's what I think:  I think that because the mini-series was produced by itself and without plans to make it into a series, that they planned to release the mini-series by itself on DVD; which they did.  Then, when they made BSG into a series and decided to release Season 1, they figured that some people (including me) who had not seen the mini-series would need the back story for Season 1 to make sense.

I could be totally wrong, and the producers could have planned this double-release to get more cash; but that seems irrelevant to argue about since there aren't any facts that support or refute that claim.  There is one fact: we are paying the same per episode for Seasons 1 and 2.0. Anyone who claims that we are paying more for Season 2, because Season 2.0 and 2.5 will add up to more than Season 1 is simply wrong.  We are paying more for more episodes.",1148860800,17,2266,4.223255813953489
2429749,5,B000BNI90Y,"Buy Season 1 and get the mini series and 13 episodes for $44.99.  Buy Season 2.0 and get 10 episodes for $34.96.  Season 1 is a slightly better value than Season 2.0.  To me, Season 2.0 is worth it.  These episodes are roughly 45 minutes long, so 2 could be considered movie length.  So, it is equivalent to buying 5 dvd movies for $34.96; or roughly $7 each.  To me, it's worth it.  This show is like one long movie to me, and it beats any new release movie on the shelfs.

Consider Season 2.0.  Not Season 2, but Season 2.0.  I figured it out right away.  I had no idea that the second half of Season 2 had yet to be aired.  I read that it was Season 2.0, and that it contained 3 discs.  I don't know why, but I cracked the code right away.  Some suggested that it should be called BG Season 2 Vol. 1, so that each and every person under the bell curve would know what they were buying without confusion.  I personally think Season 2.0 is a perfectly clear indication of the contents, and I think it sounds and looks better.

In this case, I doubt that the producers of the DVD called it 2.0 to sucker people into paying proportionally more for half a season (as I mentioned, it is still very fairly priced).  I think they had planned to release 2.0 because this Season is longer than Season 1 (Season 2 has 20 episodes versus Season 1's 13), and because fans could have it sooner and the show could keep its buzz going.  Personally, I am glad that they chose to offer us half the second Season now; and I'm glad they didn't wait 'till the fall to release all 20 episodes (which would be no doubt priced higher because it has more episodes).  If that had happened, I'm SURE that there would be many complaints about how long it took to release the second Season.

I think Season 1 was an amazing value because it included the mini-series, and that Season 2.0 is still a very good deal.  I DON'T think Season 2.0 is a rip off because we were lucky enough to get an amazing deal on Season 1.  I guess the 1 star reviewer's don't see it that way; which doesn't suprise me since they didn't figure out that Season 2.0 isn't the same as Season 2.

Although it doesn't suprise me, it makes very little sense to me.  They may have been dissapointed that they didn't get all of Season 2, but didn't they realize soon after that they still got a good deal on a fanstastic group of episodes?

I was not amused to receive only half the series with no prior warning at all. Some reviewers have commented we should have guessed since TV was only half way through airing. However it is still false marketing to call it series 2, and as I mentioned, in the UK we are often behind the US in terms of airing shows.

2429776,5,B000BNI90Y,"This show is simply one of the most exciting and interesting on television today.  Battlestar Galatica takes traditional science fiction and blends it with modern drama in a way that I found completely unexpected and amazing.  Fans of SciFi will eat this show up- as I have; and fans of great drama will also find Battlestar accessible.  The show itself can be described as a mix of Band of Brothers, the movie Aliens with elements of the original Battlestar storyline.

What the writers and producers have achieved is a scifi story that seems more plausible than the typical entries in this genre.  No one will believe the story is real- don't get me wrong -but it seems more grounded in reality.  The series has a gritty edge, and tension, that is not usually present in scifi.  The writing also sticks to the main premise, and only deviates if the new course advances the original dilemma: How will mankind survive?

I also like the conflict between the military and the civilian government.  This gives the series a chance to comment indirectly on some of the contemporary issues that we are currently facing today in the war on terror.  It also brings to life some 'worst case scenario' situations that are just entertaining to contemplate.  ""Battlestar"" does so in a fair manner that encourages discussion and thought, rather than a one-sided partisan argument.

I do believe that the writers treated Crash Down unfairly in the first three episodes- he is the only example so far of a one sided character; in my 3 years in the military I have never met a single LT as obstinate as that.  That episode also neglects the perspective of an officer- it is more of a stereotype than anything.

The Second Season writers must have a new advisor on military matters, because the influence is hard to miss: digital uniform, modern military lingo (SITREP, OPORDER...).  It does the series well, and increases its grounding in reality.

Season Two picks up right where the cliffhanger on Season One left us hanging.  The rest of the episodes included are all great, and take the story in new and unexpected directions.  One of my fears was that they would not be able to match the excellence of the First Season, but this is not the case; Season Two is even more exciting and entertaining that the First.  However, don't be fooled, this boxed set is only HALF of the Second Season.  In a few months we'll be forking over the cash for the second half.

My only critique is that the pricing is a little high for only half of the season, and you'll be left craving more episodes.  But honestly, not having access to American Cable TV in Europe, I was so happy to see that I'd get my next dose of Battlestar, the price was not a deterrent at all.  Now, on the other hand, if the second half of Season Two is released with this first half attached, I will be a little irritated.  Purchasing episodes that you already have might be a pain; but trust me, after watching the first half; you'll certainly want the next installment when it is released.",1144800000,5,3038,4.625

In particular, Edward James Olmos deserves special recognition for bringing to life one of the most sympathetic, layered heroes ever in a science-fiction series. His performance is off-the-charts.

The season contiues investing in its characters and it pays.  Also, it attacks hard social and moral issues and can be quite thought provoking.  Do the ends justify the means?  Is torture of a being you believe is not alive OK if it believes that it is?  Can machines built by man have a soul?  Can a machine love and be loved?  Does religion have a place in politics?  I don't know the answers but it sure is fun watching our crew put through the ringer to figure it all out.

And what are these fanatical and very dangerous Cylons up to any way?  Do they really want the extinction of man?  I know.  The show makes you ask a lot of questions but it also makes you think and care and that is where it shines.

Boomer, or rather Boomer one, even had her own nerd boy, the Chief.  There's hope for us all!  But there is a more here that is both compelling and thought provoking.  For these ""aliens,"" the cylons (I won't go into the story line here, other reviewers already have laid that out very well), are in truth the robot creations, mechanical ""children"" of humankind that have left their human parents.  And while on the one hand the cylons seem ruthlessly indifferent to killing and death, even their own (perhaps because their own continual ""reincarnation"" makes death a spurious issue to them), some cylons nevertheless are capable of loving at least some humans and their religious faith appears even deeper and stronger than that of the humans.  There is the ironic paradox that perhaps the cylon animosity to humans is the fruit of humankind's irreligious and careless use of creativity.  It will be interesting to see how the writers play out the religion line as well as how they play with this idea of the cylons as humankind's ""children,"" our creative offspring, rather than the mere machines, the ""toasters,"" the humans now view them as on the show.  Ultimately, as with Data on Star Trek, it becomes an interesting philosophical question about what it means to be human.

Finally, to other viewers, did anyone else see visual references to the Kennedy assassination in the series?  Whoever staged President Roslin's swearing in had to have been looking at pictures of Jackie Kennedy when LBJ was sworn in on air force one after JFK's assassination.  And the staging of Boomer getting killed after her assassination of Cmdr. Adama is eerily reminiscent of the footage of Jack Ruby killing Lee Harvey Oswald in the Dallas jail.

That is certainly the only flaw in this impressive TV series and hardly one to complain about when the stories and characters are so well drawn out.

The mysterious plan by the Cylons continues to grow and the tentative grip of hope the humans have is tested to breaking point in the first half of season two, culminating in a killer cliffhanger that leaves you desperate to know what happens next.

I cannot recommend this series too much. The acting, direction, writing and editing are all as good as you get and the standards are movie quality. The special effects are very effective and well used, feeling as if they are part of the story and not there just for show. If you like sci-fi there is no finer example and even if you don't there is surely something here to grip.

The backstory is that the robotic cylons have attacked and nearly exterminated the human race.  Only the Battlestar Galactica and its motley fleet remain and it is infiltrated by cylons in human form.  The objective of the BG is not victory but simple survival and a hiding place. Season two opens with a bang: Captain Adama is unconscious on the operating table and Colonel Tigh is in control of the Galactica and the fleet. Tigh proves not to be up to the job. I like Tigh -- very well acted by Michael Hogan -- because he is a vastly imperfect person plauged by a sexy, shrewy wife, alcohol addiction, insubordinate underlings, and his own aversion to leadership. But he's a competent shipdriver and loyal to Adama. Predictably, things get even worse as the season goes on, with the underlying theme of conflict between civilian and military authorities, father and son, lovers and losers, cylons and man....These folks know trouble.  And there's no end to it.  Every episode gets them deeper into the muck.

What makes this series special is its exploration of human relationships and fralities in a hyper-tense situation.  Every one of about 10 major characters is distinctive and finely drawn. There's plenty of shoot-em-up adventure too, led by the bawdy, hot-shot pilot Starbuck and Captain Adama's tortured son, Lee. Add a few hot and heavy love scenes, a touch of religous mysticism, and you have sci-fi noir bred with space opera. The constant theme of suspicion and mistrust makes every episode a nail-biter. Who's a cylon and who's not?  What are the cylons' objectives?  Stay tuned.  Someday it will all become clear.

When I purchased season 2 on DVD I did not realize I was just getting half a season... Boy was I upset!!! And the bigwig execs wonder why people download the episodes??!!! HEY!! BIGWIG EXECS OUT THERE!! MAKE YOUR SHOWS AVAILABLE TO US BY DOWNLOAD!! MANY OF US ARE WILLING TO PAY TO SEE OUR FAVORITE SHOWS!!!

BSG is awesome! I'm really sorry about Billy. He fell for Duala and never got a chance to learn what he did wrong with her. ""He died like a pig....""  I was hoping he would get a chance to be a man! I hope i'm not spoiling it for anyone....

I love the way the camera moves during the show, like its a documentary or live action... this adds a lot of realism to the show..

2429863,5,B000BNI90Y,"There's a lot of glowing reviews up here, then there's some negative ones. Seems a lot of people were upset that this box set includes only half of season 2. All I have to say to that is ""Caveat Emptor"" or buyer beware. Do your research, it was clear that this was only half of the second season. Ronald Moore also made it clear that, while he hoped to include the extended version of ""Pegasus"" on this box set, unfortuantely Universal wasn't able to get it out of post-production on time, it will be included on the complete season when it's released. As for paying too much...don't know about you but I paid half of what I paid for the complete first season, for half the product...seems fair to me.

Enough ranting...onto the show that is Battlestar Galactica.

It's phenomenal. Great stories, great acting, it maintains the rugged and raw feeling present in the first season. The production values are superb, cinematography is phenomenal. As someone who works in film I can honestly say that this is one of those projects that any industry type would kill to be a part of.

...but: Theese 3 DVD's became the fovourite food for my DVD-player because Galactica is family now more than before. Eight of theese ten new episodes do continue precisely the very familiar look and feel of the 1st seasons episodes. You will like them if you liked season 1.0 as I did.

The 9th episode ""Flight Of The Phoenix"" seems to be a copy of well known stuff from other well known SF series. But at its end your patience will be honored with a great surprise.

Season 2.0 ends with the ""Pegasus"" episode. I my opinion it is the downer of this season. Especially if you expect to feel the great surprise of the matching episode from the old series or read some articles about that episode as I did...

...but I believe it will be upbeated for sure in the first part of season 3.0!

It was not easy to decide wheather this season should earn 4 or 5 stars. 10 short stories as there are on theese 3 discs will leave some expectations unfulfilled.

There are many unanswered questions, of course, like, when Starbuck jumped home, and they stole the ship and came back, why didn't Starbuck bring her new boyfriend back with her?

The stories get better and darker as the crew on Galactica struggles to deal with the startling revelations from season 1 that threaten to tear the fleet apart. The 2nd season cliffhanger is an awesome nod to the original show and serves as either a ray of hope for the rag-tag colonial fleet, or a dark, troubling storm on it's horizon.

The season opens with the conclusion from season one with Adama being shot and the subsequent ""outing"" of the Cylon in their presence.  The season wraps up with the appearance of another battlestar...the ""PEGASUS"".

2429896,5,B000BNI90Y,"This set of DVDs should really be labelled season 2.5 - it consists of the episodes for the first half of season 2, as shown in the US up to December 2005.  Presumably, the rest will be released once they have been shown in the US in March 2006.

For those without (early) access to the tv series, its a great and very welcome piece of marketing - a good way of getting an early resolution on the fate of Commander Adama without reading the spoilers (he was shot dramatically by ""Sharon"" the cyclon sleeper crewmember on Battlestar Galactica in the Season 1 cliffhanger).  But its a must buy for everyone else as well, since these are episodes that need to be watched over and over again.

And there is nothing to be gained by waiting for the full set as far as I can see - despite the early release nature of the set, they come packed with extras such as deleted scenes, commentaries by the Executive Producer, and a little preview/special.

The episodes themselves are splendid.  This is unquestionably the best Sci Fi series ever made for television in my view (and I've loved quite a number of previous ones!).

The characters are believably fallible - in the first several episodes of Season 2, Colonel Tigh is in charge, and manages to completely 'frak up' everything as he is forced to admit.  The characters, though, are growing and learning, transformed in some cases by their traumatic experiences, and that too seems entirely credible given the dire nature of the events they have been through.

All of the episodes in this set rated highly for me, despite the very dark and depressing colour of the initial few episodes.  The tension as we wait to see whether risky strategies pay off - and work through the consequences of those decisions - is wonderfully conjured up.

Yet there are four episodes that absolutely stand out for me in this half season set.  'The Farm' focuses on Starbuck in a brilliant and extremely brave exploration of issues of identity and reproductive technologies.  Then 'Home Parts 1& 2' advances the quest arc dramatically.  And like all good quests, it provides opportunities for the true natures of players to be revealed, while also offering opportunities for redemption.  'Final Cut' is the other standout.  A journalist (who has caused trouble for the fleet) is invited to show the military as they really are, in the hope that this will ease some of the growing tension between the military and civilians.  Our heroes (and anti-heroes) painfully expose their shortcomings in front of her - and we are kept guessing to the end whether this will be result in honest reporting, a heavily censored propaganda piece, or a hatchet job that further undermines this struggling society.  But its the sting in the tail that really makes you want to rewatch this episode - very closely indeed - several times.  The clues ARE planted as you go along, so watch carefully...but I won't spoil!

My only disappointment is that there has been very little further exposition from the Cylon point of view so far this season - but there is still time!

The half season ends with a great new plot twist, with the appearance of a new surviving Battleship - complete with a very scary female Admiral who outranks everyone in Galactica's hierarchy.  I can't wait to get the next half set....",1140652800,,3311,4.721739130434782

Season 2.0, the first ten episodes of season 2 (Season 2.5 I'm hoping will be out on DVD by the summer) continues on right where Season 1 left off (and I ain't sayin' a damn thing about WHERE it left off) and it becomes immediately clear that the brilliant writing, acting, directing, and producing is going to continue on unhampered.  A couple things to look forward to; a Cylon boarding party turns Galactica into a shooting gallery, Sharon's ""heritage"" begins to have unexpected benefits for the crew, and Odama's command will be challenged by a new comer.

Some of you BSG fans were probably fans of other shows like Firefly and Farscape. If you were given an option to sink money early on into a show like Firefly (perhaps by buying the pilot episode on DVD or something along those lines), would you do it? What if that influx of revenue meant we would have got a whole season or two of Firefly? What do you think now?

Stop complaining about the half-season of BSG. Any fan that followed the show already knew that they were only half done with season 2, so you're not writing any headlines with this update. And, if spending some money right now on one of my favorite shows helps it get renewed for a third season, I am glad to help support this.

You are being given a chance to show financial support to one of the best shows on the air right now, and give it a better chance to survive. Sci-Fi is certainly not making their money back on an expensive show like this through ad revenue alone.

How many of our favorite shows have been eaten up by the TV system? I'm sure some of the people whining about the price of DVDs will be the same people crying if the show gets cancelled and complaining about the networks short-sightedness. Here's your chance to cast your vote with your dollars.

The story line lost a lot in the conversion from the ""real"" Galactia to this chopped version.  If I could do it all over again, I would have gone with another series and left the new Galactia to rot in the storage rooms of Amazon.",1139616000,11,1068,4.042857142857143
2429911,1,B000BNI90Y,"All the fans that are leaving reviews of this that are positive should be ashamed of themselves.  This supposed 2nd season release has come out before the end of the 2nd season!  This is not the whole thing and the fact that more people aren't compaining is incredibly sheepish and sad.  If the box says season 2.0 then it should be the whole season or at least tell us it's not with something like this:WARNING!  THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST HALF OF SEASON 2!  DO NOT BUY THIS EXPECTING THE WHOLE THING!  Shame on the distributors of this!  And shame on the people not compaining about this.  Don't be a sheep!  (insert annoying bleating sounds here)  I have examined the picture Amazon has posted and there is nothing that says it is a partial collection.  Are they going to break the whole thing up when the 2nd season actually is complete?  Or are they gonna sell this DVD plus the whole season in a separate set with a higher price?  I have never seen a single season of any tv series broken up into multiple boxes (especially poignant when you consider that BSG seasons aren't even 22 episodes long like most shows on network tv).  Whenever a distributor uses a cheap trick like this to get more money out of the fans everyone should complain.  This is BS.

2429912,5,B000BNI90Y,"I'll refrain too much from telling you just how great this show is as this review is for this product, however in Season 2.0 the action just seems to keep going, the split of stories between various characters makes you keep wondering what's happening somewhere else in the BSG universe, the visual FX are still top notch and exciting as always, and the whole gritty look to the production just create a nice feel to the show.

Overall the DVD's are well produced, menus are clean and simple, and while there's not much in the way of bonus documentaries (there's a sneak peek at the next half of the season), there are plenty of deleted scenes (lots more then I expected to see) and commentaries, that unravel the whole production and story process of the show, and reveal facts and information you might not have realised.  I find this stuff incredibly educational to listen too.

The other less-known aspect of these DVD's is that if you watch right to the end of the credits, there are some hilarious, yet slightly violent animations of Ron Moore and David Eick taking it out on each other. Every episode is different, which means I'm now having to go back through them all to watch them! (which isn't a bad thing)

One warning though - This ends on a major cliff hangar and it just 'aches' to have to wait and wonder when the next batch of DVD's will be released.  But overall, well worth the investment in what is a great TV show.",1139097600,4,1435,4.503846153846154

It is an over-priced, 10 episodes from the first half of the second season (the second half started airing in January 2006).

This is a particularly grim rip-off of fans, considering how the first season series DVD was so complete and comprehensive. (I really recommend the First Series DVD.) It is really venal of them to release this, trying to fool people into thinking it was the complete 2nd series.

For some reason, setting it in a sci-fi setting is the only way viewers will accept such a show.  I belive the origional series did the same thing, except about the cold war, and fear of the modern age instead.

It was just as addicting as the first season and I managed to watch all 10 episodes in a week.  My only complaint is that this set is a bit pricey for 10 episodes and it only covers half of the second season (the second half started airing in January), so the full set is bound to come out at the end of this year.

2429917,5,B000BNI90Y,"I was a fan of Ron Moore and David Eick's reimagining of Battlestar Galactica, from the first few moments of the 3 hour pilot, back in December 2003. Their stated goal upon commencing production of the reimagining of Glen A Larson's 70's original was '...nothing less than the reinvention of the science fiction television series. We take as a given the idea of tradtional space opera - with it's stock characters, techno double talk, bumpy headed aliens, thespian histrionics and empty heroics has run it's course and a new approach is required...'

  Their aim was to introduce realism into an aggressively unrealistic genre. Well I'm here to tell you - gentle Amazon shoppers - that they have achieved just that!! If you've not seen the pilot miniseries of this new Galactica then buy it immediately, watch the 3 hour epic that begins the show then all 13 suspenseful and masterly acted episodes, then buy this Season 2.0 - the first 10 episodes from the 20 or so run of Season 2.

  I am a drama purist, I admit it, so I don't believe in preaching to the initiated. Those of you reading this review who're familiar with Season 1 of the reimagined Battlestar will know of the show's high calibre production values and stellar acting from one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled on ANY drama, let alone Sci-Fi. To the uninitiated I will simply advise this: If Star Trek and it's 4 spin-off shows were your idea of 'realistic' sci-fi visions of mankind's future in space, then the new Galactica probably won't appeal to you. But if you like to think of yourself as a more cerebral viewer - who likes to be challenged and absorbed by your drama entertainment - then I can't recommend this show highly enough. It is adult entertainment - tackling real human issues in an often allegorical fashion. It's dark, sexy, edge of the seat stuff that pays (in this humble reviewer's opinion) sufficient homage to it's predecessor.

  Season 2.0 Boxset contains three beautifully presented slimline dvd cases with 10 Episodes between them, continuing where Season 1 left of - culminating with Pegasus, which is a two part mid-season cliffhanger that had be gagging for more. I can't wait for Universal to release Season 2.1.

  Do yourself a favour and get both Season 1 and 2.0 boxsets today. You won't regret it - I promise.",1138752000,3,2322,4.748756218905473
2429918,4,B000BNI90Y,"This is a GREAT series! If you've ever been annoyed with the prissiness ( is that a word...? )and moral superiority with the endless prosession of Star Trek- series, this is definitely something for you. Heck, I actually like most Star Trek, and I still love this series. Why? Bacause it shows us a future where the human race is not all that evolved, but where we're still undeniably HUMAN. For good or bad. And the bad guys, the cylons, are just as interesting. You're never really sure if they are completely bad or not,and you can never really predict what will happen next. I also love the fact that they keep it realistic. Everything that happens has consequences. If the ship got hammered almost to pieces in one episode, it's still broken in the next one. Of course, it's the human ( and cylon ) interaction that really makes this show shine. It's not about gadgets and technobabble, but about PEOPLE.

So why only four stars? I want more episodes!! This set contains the first ten episodes of season two, and ends on a cliff-hanger like you wouldn't believe! But now I have to wait six months or more to see what happens next!! Alright, so I could have waited until the full season box came out. But with a show this good it's hard to wait that long ( and I live in a country where you can't get Battlestar Galactica on TV ).

This is definitely a must- see show. But starting at the beginning, with the mini-series, is a good idea. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time catching up!",1138752000,4,1489,4.450549450549451
2429919,5,B000BNI90Y,"I have most definitely found this to be the most exciting, stimulating and character driven show on television during the past 18 months.  In any first season the scene must be set and main characters established.  These creators, writers and actors can be seen to be quickly developing confidence in their roles finding a solid grounding......to leap from!  The second season has been so gritty, fast and intricate with surprises in unexpected corners I just cannot wait to see what happens next.  At last a story which treats it's audience intelligently with speed, drama, darkness, losses and victories, continuity and emotion.

For me, in the beginning, it was the characters and performances of Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell who played on my curiosity and desire to watch again.  Now there is not a single character I do not want to see more of or learn more about.

This 21st century Battlestar provokes one to consider every day concepts, like the military, religion, bigotry, minority groups, leadership, our future, each in a 'think outside of the box' fashion.  You will feel anger and compassion on each issue because they are conveyed by the actors and storytelling so well.  This world created for our entertainment has indeed got me on the edge of my seat.  The story is building, I recommend you watch it from the beginning to fully appreciate how great each episode has felt in season two so far.

I didn't think the idea of a half season on DVD was appealling (and the attraction will not be the same for other shows) but I have enjoyed 2.0 so much I wouldn't want to wait a year to see them.  Enjoy it for what it is, amazing entertainment.",1138665600,,1666,4.726643598615917

1) I really, really, REALLY can't stand Starbuck. I didn't like Starbuck the blow-dried, cigar-smoking man, and Starbuck the butch, cigar-chomping chick is actually worse.

2) On a related note, I don't like the women and men are equally suited for any job 60's era (and now utterly debunked) feminism. I don't mind for one second President Roslin's nerves of steel - steadying a shaking man's hand... Women can be strong, but they will never comprise exactly 50% of combat troops, fighter pilots or of any field that requires physical strength and aggression. Sorry, just not gonna happen. Not the way the world works. The show has a reputation for 'realism' but it's depiction of the (lack of any) differences between men and women is anything but realistic. The women should all just get to work having babies and caring for them, and bandaging up the men when they get back from the dirty work (just kidding, calm down.)

3) Speaking of President Roslin, I'm tired of her religous shenanigans. What's up with that?

4) The Cylons have 12 models? Why? Seems like a good way to make it a LOT easier for humans to identify you.

OK, the good stuff (are you still there...helllooooo..).

I think the show is mostly mature in its depiction of the trade-off between democracy and (ahem) strong leadership, particularly under the circumstances.

The relationship between Adama and Roslin is genuinely interesting, and occasionally tense.

I not only like the relationship, I really just plain LIKE both characters.

Great special effects and good (I think) depictions of space battles. They actually use missiles! I think that's realistic (I don't know why, but it sure feels realistic).

Good TV Sci Fi. Very good, but I can't wait till it gets improved upon by some upstart who sees its flaws as clearly as yours truly (who will be indebted to it).",1138492800,4,2107,4.716621253405995

2429928,5,B000BNI90Y,"I got the Battlestar Galactica Season 1 and 2.0 yesterday in my post box after only 15 hours after I ordered it from one of Norways best Music and DVD title entertainment shop companies. Since the Battle Star series is popular in Norway too by many Sci Fiction fans, the company importing the DVD TV Series from USA.

We in Norway pay 75 USD dollars for season 1 and 68 USD dollars for season 2.0, if we don't want to import the DVDs from Amazon in U.S. and must pay much of import and post service taxes extra to the Norwegian government for all the orders we do as private persons from shops outside of Norway when the orders are over 30 USD dollars. It's very awful. We could import the UK version, but that versions have not the miniserie included in the Season 1 box and must be paid for in a seperate DVD. The Season 2 is not yet avaiable in DVD in the UK before after all the 20 episodes been showed on Sky TV in England and the rest of the UK countries. The TV company that working together with the Sci Fi Channel on the Battlestar Galactica. No other television stations in Europe have started to thinking of sending the Battlestar Galactica on TV.

So if we don't can buy the Battlestar Galactica on DVD, more and more people starting to download this and much other TV series illegally on the net. If people can't buy it on DVD or see it on TV, they download it illegally. The Itunes is avaiable in Europe too, but there is only possible to download this and some other TV series, music videos, Pixar short movies from ITunes if you live in the US. The reason why Sci Fi Channel choose to sell the DVD versions as early as possible, is because time is money for the TV stations and they are very pressed now to sell seasons in parts to make it possible to buy the TV series on DVD as fast as possible. Example the Sci Fiction 5 seasons of Facscape is both in whole seasons and in 5 parts DVD seasons. We should be happy that the Battlestar Galactica season 2 is in 2 DVD parts only and have 10 episodes each. Farscape have 4-5 episodes per DVD part box if you don't choose to buy the complete seasons 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Now Sci Fi Channel working hard to make the DVDs on the last 2 parts (4 and 5) of the season 5, one new ready for the shops for each month. All the 5 seasons of Farscape is ready on DVD in April or May 2006. The extremely best site of all about all the TV series on DVD in United States, you find on the very fantastic TVShowsOnDVD net site  [...]

Now back to the Battlestar Galactica on DVD. The DVD Cover is fantastic and the quality of the TV serie is very good. We in Norway and the rest of Scandinavia that buy the U.S. DVD versions know that the DVD is not subtitled on our language, but most of us in our countries is so good in English that we understand and can speaking most of the English and American language. We don't want waiting no longer to hope one of our TV stations broadcast it in the near future and maybe can buy it on DVD in 2007-2008.

Od course we could see series as 24, Prison Break, Rome, Lost, Desperate Housewives, Alias, Buffy, the 4400 and all the 3 CSI series, but no one sending the Sci Fiction series from the Sci Fiction Channel. There is many people in the Scandinavia that love Science Fiction, but we had only the series Babylon 5, Star Trek and X-Files in the 1990s. We want to pay for the Science Fiction Channel sending on the cable TV and satellites in Europe. In a pause period of the serie Lost around christmas and the new year we could watch the 5 parts Sci Fiction Channel mini serie ""5 Days to Midnight"" and in same time possible to buy the 2xDVD too.

I have now seen a lot of the Battlestar Galactica on my DVD playter and must say I am agree that this TV serie is really fantastic. The drama between the humans on the Battlestar Galactica and the Cylons is amazing. Much good acting and a story with other things than aliens, space animals and creatures. I really like the very beautiful, smart and sexy Cylons women. I want to tell my friends about this fantastic TV serie too and looks forward to watch the rest of the season that going on in these days. With its success and maybe winning a lot of prizes for been one the best TV series the last year there should also be at least some seasons more. I have never seen the old version of Battlestar Galactica, but can't think it necessary to do it.

From the shop in Norway I ordered the Battlestar Galactica it is possible to buy the importing 5 DVD seasons of Farscape. I'm thinking of if I would buy it or not. It would cost much money,but still I have more than enough to watch all the fantastic Battlestar Galactica seasons on my DVD player. I am also a true Lost fan and bought the DVD version of Season 1 some months ago, of course with subtitles in all the Scandinavian languages, but half out in the the season 2 it seems to be strong to be more than 2 seasons, since the plots are going more and more bad now.",1138320000,2,4956,4.183246073298429

2429933,5,B000BNI90Y,"So often does the sci-fi genre miss the point. Their focus turned on the technology aspect and following a done-to-death good versus evil plotline. While Battlestar Galactica does feature advanced technology, it doesn't rely on it to tell a good story. And telling a good story is something this series does extremely well. Instead of cramming an entire plot into singular episodes like Star Trek, this series creates plot arcs that spans several episodes or even seasons.

Not that I don't like Star Trek, I am a fan of that series as well, but episodes of Star Trek are not as involving for the viewer as episodes of Battlestar Galactica. Galactica forces the watcher to infer morals and themes, instead of spoon feeding them like most other shows. Therin lies Galactica's brilliance. While astounding technology  is present, it takes a backseat role with regards to themes and  morals. This series captures the essence of sci-fi, its original intent. When HG Wells wrote War of The Worlds, he wasn't trying to just wow people with his fantastic ideas, his stories had a message. Over the years, however the sci-fi genre has missed the point. The purpose of integrating incredible happenings or technology is to paint our world in a different light. To make people see humanistic problems in way that puts the world in a different perspective. Its not just about technology. Battlestar Galactica recoginzes this and finally reclaims sci-fi's ambition.

This season is the best since the miniseries, and while the new episodes that first aired January 6, 2006 have seemingly outdone it, it would still benefit anyone who hasn't seen BSG before to watch this DVD. Anyone who has simply jumped into the series without watching this season will be thouroughly confused. A lot of people have specific concerns over this DVD which I will address individually below:

(Q) Why was this DVD released before season 2 was completed?

(A) If you remember, there was a three month period between the time when the episodes ""Pegasus"" and ""Ressurection Part 1"" were aired. So while sci-fi.com may claim that season 2 is still in progress, that is a mere technicality as the episodes after  January 6, 2006 are essentially season 3. It would have been quite foolish for the producers to not release a DVD of the past 10 episodes during that time.

(Q) Why does humanity have the capacity to conquer the non-trivial challanges of interplanetary space travel but can't cure President Roslin's cancer or develop anti-virus programs for computer networks? And why does the series feature Starbuck driving Hummers and civilians wearing suits and ties when the setting alludes to humanity as a more advanced society?

(A) Any small amount of thought will reveal that there is no such thing as ""the future,"" only many possible futures. The same can be said for the past as history could have played out quite differently at any time. BSG recognizes this by setting its characters and events in a possible past. So its no surprise that there are a few similarities and differences between our world and the world of BSG.

(Q) Why is this DVD at full price when technically its only half a season?

(A) Look at what you're getting. You get 10 episodes, and at one hour per episode that's at least 10 hours of footage not including bonus features. This DVD wasn't meant to be a three day long collection of every shred of BSG matierial known to man, unlike the Star Trek: The Next Generation DVD boxed set which features countless hours of abstinence, er, Star Trek. You know what I mean.

So thats it, buy this DVD if you haven't seen BSG before and if you have, you should still buy it. Because any self-respecting sci-fi fan NEEDS to own this.",1137801600,3,3722,4.82574568288854

2429939,1,B000BNI90Y,"I love SciFi and I loved the old series, but this reincarnation is extremely bland. I often cannot even tell that I am watching SciFi . There are episodes where every civilian is wearing a necktie and a suit, as if this was taking place on Earth! StarBuck drives around in a Hummer, American street signs, an absolute lack of any type of advanced technology. Give me a break- why would everybody dress exactly the way we do? Most scenes that take place on a planet,look exactly like they are taking place on Earth. There is nothing alien about the surroundings at all. They never show an extra moon in the sky or alien life, etc. This series shows absolutely none of the attention to detail that made Star Trek a classic sci-fi series. Its has none of the exotic feel that I look for in sci-fi. The Cylons appear as totally human looking and act like humans- there is nothing spooky, unusual or mystifying about them at all- what is the point of that? In fact, one of the main Cylons is a cute Asian girl, who may as well have on The Apprentice or the OC, she seems and acts totally normal! Adama speaks in a constant mumbling monotone and shows absolutely no emotion ever. The President is played by a whiny woman who sounds like she is going to cry all the time , and has absolutely no ""presence"" when compared to other actors who have played Presidents on other shows.

The Battlestar Galactica is a dreary worn out ugly ship, with absolutely no indication itpossesses any advanced technology. They speak to one another with big blocky old style wired telephones! Wouldn't a starship have at least cellular phone technology?? The list can go on & on. The Balter gimmick is silly- he is constantly talking to a beautiful Cylon women only he can see. Again, the same problem- what is Cylon about her? She is just another ordinary annoying woman- there is nothing alien about her! Also, how about an explanation of how the Cylons came to be & how they became independent- there is no history with respect to this at all.

2429940,3,B000BNI90Y,"I bought this under the impression that the episode ""Pegasus"" was the Season 2 finale and this was the full second season. I was slightly miffed by the fact that this so-called ""Season 2.0"" is only ten episodes, but they were damn good episodes, so I was willing to let it slide. Then I go on scifi.com and find out that the past two episodes - ""Resurrection Ship"" parts 1 and 2 - are listed as part of the second season.

You know what this is? It's FRAUD. I don't care about buying half-seasons as long as DVD manufacturers are HONEST about it. I have plenty of half-season boxsets. The thing is, they're all labeled as ""Season 1 VOLUME 1"", ""Season 1 VOLUME 2"", ""Season 2 VOLUME 1"" and so on. You don't EVER see half-season boxsets labeled as if they're full seasons, because that's FALSE ADVERTISING.

So what'll be released next? Season ""2.1"" or ""2.5"" or something retarded like that?

I still give this 3 stars, because it's still Battlestar Galactica, and it's still one of the best shows in TV history.

Rather than complaining about having -the option- to directly support the best show on TV through the purchase of these convienient 10 episode DVD packages why not simply wait for the full season set?

I don't have cable so these smaller packages are great because they allow me to keep up with the series without having to wait a year between each season release.

ROBBED OF EXTRA!!!!!!!!!!

MY COMPLAINT BUT IS WITH THE DVD MAKER UNIVERSAL. That is why i have left a 5 star rating for the show as I do like it

ON THE BATTLESTAR SITE RON MOORE THE BSG PRODUCER IN A PODCAST advised that on the DVD was an extended episode 10 Pegasus.

I have watched this and Ep 10 was the same length as every other episode. It should have run a lot longer over an hour, not 44 minutes

So we were robbed of an extra that we should of got.

Why buy half season DVD's which are almost as expenisve as full season DVD's when the slack providers do give us the pormised extra's

Maybe we should just watch free Torrents and forget buying DVD sets.

I waited 2-3 weeks to get this in Australia and was mightly pissed off when I did not get the extra.

Universal should put a retraction on the "" whats New "" section of the BSG website saying we robbed you of the promised extra.

Plus they should send us the robbed extra on a new disc free of charge.

2429946,5,B000BNI90Y,"This show is so amazing, as the characters are so real (read unlikable if you like), as they are flawed (as everyone is), and they struggle with themselves to survive.  That is what drama is about.  William Faulkner, perhaps the greatest writer of the modern era, said something to the effect of ""the only tale worth telling is that of the human heart in conflict with itself,"" and he is absolutely right.  Not only the characters of Galactica live this reality, but the ambiguous nature of the events that transpire force the viewer to do the same.  I like to say it is Soprano's, in space (read great).  I also love the documentary feel to it, as it truly fits this adult themed drama that is far beyond the original in scope and power.  In regards to the complaint concerning technology (curing cancer and the like), where is it written that technology in all fields has to advance at the same rate?  Medical technology and transportation technology have nothing to do with each other.",1136592000,4,988,4.64367816091954

Finally, an adult sci fi series with real issues, great characters and plot twists and turns that keep you guessing. The production values (fx, costume etc) all makes sense to me - who needs all that shiny star trek stuff! How a previous reviewer can say such negative things about this new series is beyond me and I work in TV so I should know.

2429949,1,B000BNI90Y,"Being a fan of most Sci-fi, I gave this show a try. But I was disappointed.  Too many of the main characters are just so unlikeable, it's hard to get into the drama of the events going on around them or care about what happens to any of them. All the talk of ""strong women roles"" is kind of wasted when half of the ""strong women"" roles are held by the supposed ""bad guys"". The cable budget shows with little use of the new CGI Cylons, which are very cool looking, but really should be used more often.  They get around this by making a model of the Cylons that look like humans now. This idea is not new to Sci Fi and it didn't work in the original Galactica (actually I believe that was in ""Galactica 1980"") and it really doesn't work for me now.  They cut corners in wardrobe by just using common Western styles.  Coats and ties??  Really? Thousands of light years away and Armani still has a thriving market?  Both planets ""Caprica"", which was suppose to have been destroyed by a nuclear attack although you would never know it except by the fact the characters occasionally take radiation shots and ""Kobol"", which is suppose to be a long ago abandoned planet, look strikingly the same.  Both are filmed in rainy forests in Vancouver, BC as I understand it, but a little more imagination could have masked this fact. It's a bit of a stretch for me to believe a society that supposedly has space travel, super fast vipers and FTL (Faster Than Light) drives, can't figure out how to network computers without getting a virus or still hasn't cured cancer. The shaky M-TV style camera work distracts from what should be really cool space battle scenes.  I thought this was going to be about ""...a journey to Earth.."" but after 2 1/2 seasons they haven't gone anywhere and are just fighting amongst themselves more than they actually fight the Cylons. And I have to agree with those who commented on the price of this DVD set.  That's WAY too much for just half a season. Maybe I'll have better luck with ""Serenity"".",1136419200,9,2014,4.48087431693989
2429950,5,B000BNI90Y,"As many have written, this is among the best dramas currently on television, and may even rank in the top ten dramas ever produced.  The acting is outstanding; the story lines are compelling and challenge the intellect.  The line between good and evil is ambiguous at best, leaving the viewer to wonder who the ""bad guys"" are.  In my opinion, Galactica is as good as the Sopranos and the West Wing (at least the first three seasons) and meant for the same audience.  With its plot twists, surprises and excellent character and story development, Galactica reminds me of the halcyon days of Hill Street Blues, when I waited for the next new episode with great anticipation. No, I do not let my children watch this show.  It is simply too violent and dark for younger viewers.

  However, the DVD set is a disappointment. The makers of Galactica claimed that an expanded version of the episode ""Pegasus"" would be included in the DVD release.  But it is not there.  I also suspect that consumers will be forced to purchase the second season in its entirety at an inflated price when it is released, thus rendering season 2.0 a waste of money twice over.  You know, I'm not a communist or a radical revolutionary.  I like making money and accumulating things probably more than the average person.  However, lately  everywhere I turn I see one example after another of pure, unbridled corporate greed.  This DVD set is one.",1136332800,9,1419,4.711382113821138

It doesn't matter whether you are a ""sci-fi"" fan or not, this is simply one of the best character driven dramas on television or anywhere.  The quality of this show is so high that it easily surpasses most of today's sci-fi movies.  Next to the Firefly/Serenity franchise, this is probably the best sci-fi themed entertainment I've ever seen, and it comes very close to the quality of that incredible series.  What makes it so good is that, like Firefly/Serenity, the characters are SO VERY REAL.  The motivations of both the bad guys and the good guys are so complex that sometimes I wonder whether their roles have been reversed.  Edward James Olmos is a force of nature as Commander Bill Adama.  If he doesn't win an Emmy for Best Actor this year...  Well, that will simply be more proof that the Emmy's are just a popularity contest rather than a measure of quality performance that they should be.  If you haven't seen this show before, start with the mini-series and then the first season (this definitely needs to be watched in order), but the important thing is to START watching it.  Even if you've never watched anything ""sci-fi"" before that you liked, you will probably like this show.  It's simply that good.",1136332800,4,1289,4.684444444444445

The season picks up right where Season 1 left off: Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos) has been shot by Sharon (Grace Park), who is actually a cylon. Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tahmoh Penikett) are stranded on Caprica, and Apollo (Jamie Bamber) is under arrest after attempting to stage a mutiny with President Roslin (Mary McDonnell). As the season progresses, the Galactica crew is forced to deal with having the unpopular and alcoholic Colonel Tigh (Michael Hogan) in command, a breakup of the fleet instigated by Laura and Apollo, and the realization that a cylon might be the ship's only hope for survival.

I've said it before and I'll say it again...I usually hate science fiction shows, but ""Battlestar Galactica"" is an amazing character-driven drama that just HAPPENS to be set in space.

What's really insulting is that Universal has the gall to release the first half of this season for the price of a full season worth of shows. Sure, it's on sale now. HOWEVER, the fact that they feel they are justified in charging you $49.99 for less than 10 hours worth of scripted programming is ghastly. I'd give this set a solid ""5"". The show deserves it.

2429955,5,B000BNI90Y,"The new ""Battlestar Galactica"" isn't just a great sci-fi show - it's a great show, period.  You know you are in for a treat when luminous stars like Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell don't stand out from an ensemble of gifted and exciting young actors.  That's just where we begin...now take a moment to thank Executive Producers David Eick, Ronald D. Moore and Toni Graphia for re-envisioning this 70s cult series in a way that is hard to articulate, much less imagine.  Undoubtedly influenced by the ""post-9/11"" aura that surrounds much art these days, this dark and troubled story continually asks the big questions - ""What is true faith?""  ""What does it mean to be human?"" And...""Are we the good guys?""  When the Cylons seem to have a greater spiritual life than the humans, you know you are in for good drama.  Much like ""24"", ""Battlestar Galactica"" manages to find heart-stopping action while going at an achingly slow ""real-time"" pace...the cliff-hangers from week to week leave you on the edge of your seat, and it can take a season (or more) to resolve a mystery you are just dying to know about.  Along the way, more plotlines are woven in, and you find yourself hopelessly hooked (which is why the DVDs are so terrific...they allow you to blast through the entire first two seasons without the wait - and make for a great marathon viewing).  Adding to that sense of anticipation is one of the best scores written for a television series today - tribal drumbeats composed by Richard Gibbs and Bear McCreary that elevate this excellent show's action from ""great"" to ""epic"".  It's a show where you find yourself rooting for folks.  There are many choices.  Pretty Brit boy Jamie Bamber has an addictive energy combined with honest intensity that makes everything ""Apollo"" does seem justified.  Katee Sackoff gets extra kudos for putting up with the criticism from the original series fans.  She brings a complexity and depth to ""Starbuck"" that makes you see this character as not male, female, butch, femme, but fully rounded, and fully human.  She is, perhaps, the one character we absolutely know is not a Cylon - her struggle to find her life's path is just too real.  James Callis, another cute Brit, does an admirable turn as Gaius Baltar, the man who betrays humanity.  His psychological meanderings have been ground for one of the few criticisms of the series, becoming almost too overarching in Season One, something quickly corrected by Season Two.  These ""out of body"" moments are not to be dismissed, however.  His dialogues with Tricia Helfer's ""Cylon Six"" create the ethical foundation, and some of the most provocative moments, in the series.  Tricia Helfer is one of those women born to be a sex symbol, but to her credit she makes an interesting and excellent foil for Baltar's tortured struggle.  Grace Park does an admirable job portraying a woman who does not fully understand who she is, while Kandyse McClure finally gets her well-earned shot as a very likeable subordinate from whose eyes we can see the greater struggles.  For folks who like the ongoing eye-candy factor, Tahmoh Penikett fills the bill and more...given an impossible situation, he tries to just do ""the right thing"".  Fans of the original series will not be disappointed.  Richard Hatch, the original ""Apollo"" does an absolutely stunning turn as a terrorist turned politician.  How very apt.  This is not the ""bells and whistles"" series from a tech standpoint.  Unlike so many sci-fi series of late, there is paper, and telephones, and when people get injured they stay that way for a while ... no magic hypo-sprays.  But it is in this low-tech future that we can see the people, and they shine in the darkness.  The DVD sets should thrill fans of the series, being packed with extras that were first marketed online as the early episodes unfolded.  Definitely a must-own for any fan of good television.",1136073600,5,3905,4.8476621417797885
2429956,5,B000BNI90Y,"Until the Sopranos and Deadwood reappear from their protracted slumbers, this is the finest hour of television on television. Week after week this adult drama delivers the goods, rewarding the viewer with some of the tightest writing, finest acting, and best visual effects the small screen can hold.

There's plenty of excellent reviews here and a quick Google search will turn up an endless list of professional reviewers who all agree that this incarnation of Battlestar Galactica is not only great science fiction, it's just great entertainment. I hold with the camp who believes that you do not need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy this show. In fact all the show requires is a bit of concentration and a little loyalty to let the story develop over time. Those who do so are richly rewarded with story lines that reveal themselves logically and with stunning depth rather than the usual ""wrap it up in an hour"" pace of network television.

For anyone yet to sample this brilliant work, I'd suggest a couple of starting points to get your feet wet. In the first season (available for download on iTunes by episode), the episodes ""33"" and ""The Hand of God"" contain the best of what the show has to offer. In this set (also available by episode on iTunes) the episodes ""Pegasus"" and ""Scattered"" will do the trick. Get a taste there, then come back and buy here. It's well worth every cent. In fact it's a bargain.

For those of us who grew up in the 70s and endured the Galactica of old-- including its bug-eyed aliens, its robot doggy, its simpleton plots and group hugs and recycled visual effects week after week -- this show is for us. It carries forth the best elements of the old train wreck and sprinkles delicious tastes of various old episodes throughout.

But again, don't worry if you've never heard the name before and have no idea what the old show was about. In fact don't worry if you have no patience for the sci fi genre. This is entertainment that transcends its genre to become what most TV shows aspire to become: must-see-TV, watercooler TV, call it what you will.

The commentary tracks are basically the podcasts produced last year for the first half of the second series. They add a lot to the understanding of what is behind the show's thinking and thrust.

However, it is the delete scenes (which are mentioned in the podcasts) that really add the flavor. The back story for various characters (Apollo and Tigh and Adama) or (Gaius and Number Six) are played out in fully developed scenes. This adds a great deal to the story.

Although its based on the late 70's original classic, it beats the hack out of the older Battlestar.  The acting was so good and each individual character was so interesting.  Season 2.0 episodes were even better than 1.0 with many surprises which push you even further to the edge of the seat.  2.0 also mashes up the good and bad poltics, the trust and distrust, good decisions and bad decisions, and the best out of all are ally and enemies.  Perhaps the biggest question of all, are Cylons really enemy?  BSG 2.0 manages the story extemely well by intergrating three environments (Deep Space, Kobol and Caprica) altogether, its occassional flashbacks are extremely powerful.  I couldn't be more please to see more Centurions in actions, they are meaner than Terminators.

2429963,4,B000BNI90Y,"This renewed series settles down a bit in its second season. That doesn't mean there is any less action, excitement or story line but it does appear more coherent. The stories are easier to follow with slightly less reliance on flashbacks and fast cuts between story lines. The actors are learning more about their characters and everything is falling into a groove. It is an improvement over the first season.

Synopses of the Episodes appear below:

Scattered - The season opener for the second season picks up right where the finale of the first season ended. Kobol has been found but Adama has been shot by a Cylon sleeper agent. His condition is critical and a Cylon base star makes hanging around Kobol dicey. The order goes out for the fleet to jump. They do only to find that there has been an error. The fleet is not at the location where the Galactica has jumped. The coordinates for the emergency jump had not been passed along. To make matters worse, the ship's doctor is not aboard. He was visiting another ship and Adama needs surgery quickly. The only workable solution involves jumping back and recalculating the jump to figure out where the fleet has gone. This will be estimated to take 12 hours and there is no way the Galactica can survive in the hostile environment for that long. The only other option involves networking the ship's computers so that the calculations can be done faster. This will make them vulnerable to Cylon attack. There are no good choices.

Valley of Darkness - Things are looking grim. The Galactica has managed to find the fleet but there have been consequences. The Cylons managed to infect the Galactica's computers while they were networked to calculate the jump. To make matters worse, the Cylons also managed to land a boarding party which is working its way towards the Galactica's destruction. Things are not going to well on Kobol either. Those crew members who had to ditch there at the end of season one are still on the run and Baltar is being further and further seduced into the camp of the Cylons. Meanwhile, back on Caprica, Starbuck and Helo are stranded without a ship deep in enemy held territory; that consists of the entire planet and all surrounding space.

Fragged - Things remain ugly as the Galactica tries to mount a rescue mission for their raptor crew stranded on Kobol. In the first place, the president is under arrest for inciting a mutiny and is losing her mind. Other politicians are glad to stir things up further and the worst politician of all is Tigh's wife who sees the situation as an opportunity for her husband (and her) to gain in power. Adama is still unconscious and it is driving TIgh back to drink. Meanwhile, on the planet, an inept officer conceives a plan to attack a Cylon missile installation with his fellow strandees composed mostly of maintenance types and the Vice president. In a strange twist, the some of the military forces prove to be cowards and Baltar grows a set of cojones. It is one set of twists after another.

Resistance - Things are falling apart all over. Colonel TIgh declared martial law in the last episode and in this one the fleet is falling into mutiny. Tigh is not doing a good job in command and his social parasite wife just drives him on to make worse and worse decisions in the hope that her own start will rise. Some of the officers are getting edgy about Tigh also and an effort to spring the president comes to the fore with Starbuck taking the lead. Meanwhile, back on Caprica, Boomer and Helo encounter a real enclave of human resistance. Each suspects the other of being Cylon. There is hope. Adama is getting better and may even recover from his coma soon.

The Farm - While Adama tries to regain control of a mutinous fleet, he must contend with a son who has chosen to work with the opposition and a dying president who sets herself up as a religious zealot and savior. The president persuades a sizable portion of the fleet to jump with her back to Kobol and the Cylons waiting there. She is convinced by her religious beliefs that she will be able to save them. Starbuck, on the other hand, is still with the resistance on Caprica. During a raid she gets shot, left behind, captured by Cylons and faces the prospects of being used as a broodmare.

Home Part 1 - Starbuck finally makes it back to the fleet from Caprica and she has the mythical arrow with her. She also has the Cylon, Boomer, who in another incarnation, tried to assassinate Commander Adama. This does not make for good relations with Apollo. Nobody really trusts Boomer but she is allowed to live because she promises to lead the president to the tomb where the way to earth can be found. IT will be a dangerous mission and people will die. It is even more dangerous for Apollo because some of the rebels see him as an obstacle to their own power.

Home Part 2 - Adama takes his portion of the fleet back to Kobol in an attempt to reunite with the president and heal the divisions in the remnants of humanity. The president and her party are looking for the tomb and are being aided by the version of Boomer that did not try to assassinate the president. Still, the confrontation does not lead to a harmonious reunion. Meanwhile, the Cylon known as number six is still up to her mindgames with Baltar. He is becoming less tractable and subject to control. She still wants a baby but allows as how she does not necessarily have to be the mother. From there, she morphs to appear like Starbuck and really gets his hormones running at overtime. He is half convinced that he is going crazy. He is, of course, but not in the way he suspects. The tomb does get found but the answers found there are not as easy to understand as would have been hoped. It does seem, however, that political fences are being mended if one discounts the occasional betrayal, scheme and sudden plot twist.

Final Cut - I had watched all of the episodes of this new version of a venerable old series with a mild degree of interest but never with any sense of engagement. That changed with this episode. A muckraking reporter is allowed access to the Galactica. The access is virtually unfettered. It is obvious that the reporter intends a hatchet job and is a ""typical"" reporter in that the military is bad, always and without exception and that nothing is more important than the career of the reporter. That includes the survival of humanity. During the course of her investigation, though, she uncovers a lot of ugly stuff. She also uncovers some of what it is like to serve. In her final cut, she has not produced a hatchet job. She has produced a piece that shows the heroism as well as the failings of the fleet. All of that is for the good but that is not what hooked me. During the final viewing, I heard some familiar strains of music. This is music that has been in my memory since the 70s. After all of the pseudo-music (at least its not to my taste) of all the previous episodes, the triumphal strains of the theme from the original series begin to emerge just as it is clear that the warriors of the fleet are not going to have their lives, sacrifices and mission further compromised. That silly little bit hooked me. The hook was set when the identity of yet another Cylon agent was revealed in the final few moments of the episode.

Flight of the Phoenix - in an episode that is a bit more light hearted than usual, not a difficult task with such chaos being the norm, there are only two primary plot lines in this one. The first involves a Cylon computer virus set to disable the Galactica and leave her open to attack from a large Cylon task force. The only hope to beat them involves trusting Boomer the Cylon and making themselves completely defenseless. The other story line involves the crew chief. As an article of faith, he tries to build a viper from scratch. Everyone says he is crazy but, eventually, many of the crew get sucked into the project. When it is done, it has some previously undersigned capabilities.

Pegasus - In this season finale, a plot line is lifted from the original BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series. At least part of it is. The Galactica encounters another colonial Battlestar, the Pegasus, commanded by the legendary Admiral Kane. Needless to say, the Admiral outranks Commander Adama. Their command styles are...different. Adama is not known for his warm and fuzzy ways but is a teddy bear compared to the Admiral and the Admiral is not pleased with the way he has been running his command. Still, the two launch a combined reconnaissance against a Cylon task force. While the mission is away, however, the Admiral arrests two of the Galactica's crew, charges them with treason and issues a summary judgment of guilt and decrees execution. Adama will not accept that and commences an operation to get his crew back. The stage is set for a conflict and the episode and season end on that note.",1135555200,4,8913,4.571339173967459

In case you have read info on this disc set elsewhere saying otherwise: there is NO longer version of the final episode ""Pegasus"", there are NO Podcasts for the final 2 episodes and one other (so 7 podcasts for 10 episodes). Not much in the way of extras either as per Season 1 though over an hour of deleted scenes, though again NONE from the final episode. Sooo, yes this was very much rushed out of the door in time for the holidays in what one might consider an incomplete form. The big question now is: will we be forced to repurchase all of these episodes to get the remainder of the season or will we be able to just buy the second half? And I think it's mean spirited to have a coupon for $10 off the Serentiy DVD or $5 off the Seaquest DVD but NO coupon for the rest of Season 2.

2429966,5,B000BNI90Y,"This reincarnation of Battlestar Galactica is the best science fiction show to ever air on television.  Better than any of the Star Treks.  Better than Farscape.  Better than FireFly.  Certainly better than StarGate.  And yes, even better than Babylon 5 (which I always felt was weighed down by wooden acting and mediocre dialogue).

If we're being honest, what has been called ""good sci-fi"" in the past hasn't always stood up against the best that television has to offer outside the science fiction genre.  Hey, I loved Star Trek:TNG.  I may even have called it my ""favorite"" program at one time.  But I never would have called it the ""best"" program on television.  Well, times have changed.  BSG is not just great sci-fi; it's the best show on television.  At the very least, it's in the conversation.  Everything about this show is terrific.  The production values are very high.  The show feels ""real"" in a way that no other sci-fi show I can think of comes close to accomplishing.  The acting is uniformly excellent.  The dialogue is crisp (maybe not Whedon-esque with the clever banter, but still very good).  The writing is complex and compelling (I love the sociopolitical and religious elements that the writers have woven into the story).  Yes, the cylons and the space fights are wicked cool, but in the end this is science fiction for the thinking man and woman.  It's too bad that some people feel the need to bash this show simply because it's not a continuation of that cheesy, kids-oriented crapfest from the seventies.

I only noticed when I was looking at season 1 dvd set. They call it ""Season One"". On this set they call it ""Season 2.0"", so I started getting suspicious why it was 2.0 and not Two, as if they were planning to release a 2.5. After further research I found the season isn't even fully aired yet. I don't follow the Sci-Fi channel because all they play is horror with rare goodies like this show in it.

I got Season 1 DVD at Wal-Mart for 19.98 after it was out for a while. Season ""2.0"" I atleast got on sale for 29.99 w/ the $10 off for buying Serenity. But it's still a rip. WAIT FOR THIS TO GO DOWN, YOU WILL FIND IT FOR 9.99 WITHIN MONTHS I GUARANTEE.

2429973,5,B000BNI90Y,"In addition to what another reviewer just wrote about receiving 10 dollars off - if you, like me, bought the UK import version of season 1 and still lack the Miniseries - simply buy The MiniSeries, Season 2.0 and Serenity - and you'll get an extra 10 dollars off (that makes 20 alltogether, just tell the cashier that the Miniseries is season 1.0 - and they'll give you two 10 dollar discounts).  Therefore, if you planned on buying Serenity and the Mini-Series like me, you'll basically get the 20 dollar mini-series for free, and complete your battlestar collection.

As for the case for season 2.0 I was a bit dissapointed - it's similiar to the one for Space: Above and Beyond - in that the DVDs are contained in slim sleek cases (not a bad thing stylistically, however they break easy).  The outer case is also not as appealing as the case for the UK version.  However, all in all, the case is by no means bad, just not as good as last season's.

The last DVD also contains a preview of episodes premiering in January (though I would have preferred an entire bonus episode), and there deleted scenes and podcasts.  Finally, as for the series itself - nothing more can be said than that it is great.  Great for the top notch writing that keeps you glued, episode after episode, even better for the wonderful acting performances, set design, special effects and camera work - that make what is fiction on the screen seem real in your living room.",1135036800,7,1449,4.55

2429975,5,B000BNI90Y,"There is a lot of talk in the reviews of why Universal is releasing half of the season now.  Yes, it is to make money.  However, it is also a way to allow people new to the show to catch up before the January 6th continuation of the 2nd season.

If you want to wait for the full 2nd season set - which there probably will be eventually - then please wait.  However, you need to remember that while the show is a hit in Sci-Fi Channel terms it is not even close to the ratings or the advertising revenue as network shows.  Galactica is not a cheap show to make even shot in Canada.

I have a friend who has worked for the production companies that do the Stargates.  If not for the DVD sales they could not have continued to do SG1 and there never would have been an Atlantis.  The licensing fee from Sci-Fi could not cover the costs (especially of a long running show with  increasing salaries every year behind and in front of the camera).  The DVD sales allowed them to continue, spin off Atlantis, and remain on Sci-Fi in a way that made economic sense to both parties (Sci-Fi and the production company).  Look, the reason HBO wants the Sopranos back every year, and can bring it back for another season, is because of the DVD revenue (Emmy Awards are great but they don't pay the bills and don't think for a minute our subscriptions are covering all those show costs....).

That is how we should all be looking at Galactica and its DVD releases. Yes, it is a way to make money.  Good for them.  If the merchandising and syndication of Star Trek hadn't been so successful Paramount would have literally gone out of business in the 70's.  This has been written about a lot, especially around the time they were owned by Gulf and Western.  Trek carried them for a long time even before the movies or the new shows came around in the 80s and 90s.

Universal is a business and if it doesn't make economical sense to do the show they will stop.  If you want to wait for hopefully the full season on DVD again please wait.  However, I am personally getting copies of the first half of season 2 for friends who need to catch up before January 6th.  I want this show to continue, I want to support it, and I want more people coming to it.  If releasing half of season 2 now helps with costs, proves there is a audience base beyond the ratings on Sci-Fi (and remember, Sci-Fi doesn't have the same market penetration/carriage as channels like ESPN or CNN which everyone has) it helps insure that there will be a season 3, 4, etc.  At least it makes a great argument for them.

Yes, it is kind of a pain that they are splitting the season but hopefully the benefit to us all in the long run will be that the show continues and at the level and production value it is now.

Though this might be taken as a joke - and I do not mean it to be - look at a show like 7th Heaven.  I used to work for Spelling Entertainment who produced it.  For years it was the #1 show on The WB (even beating out Buffy some years).  I think this past year it was number 3 for them, I believe behind Smallville and Gilmore Girls (both those shows ratings are up this year by the way).  Still pretty darn good.  However, 7th was cancelled and ends in May because of costs, not ratings.  The principle actors are reported to be making around $100,000 per episode and per episode cost is around $2 mil.  That is high for any show and puts it in ""24"" or ""Lost"" territory.  The difference is that 7th Heaven doesn't sell the DVD units that 24 or other shows (Smallville, Lost, Gilmore - which flies off the shelves according to my friend at Warners - or even Galactica) does.  If it did 7th would probably have come back for another season.  The Los Angeles Times wrote an article a month or so ago about this fact.  The producers of 24 said in that article if not for the DVD sales they'd be off the air because even Fox could not afford them (that is, in relation to per episode cost versus per episode advertising revenue they are able to generate).  So do not underestimate the importance or impact of this revenue stream even on network shows considered hits.

So is Universal making money?  Absolutely.  I don't know about you but when Universal thinks Galactica I want them to think ""Profit center!"". Again, if you want to wait please wait, please don't spend the money now if a full season 2 comes out next year and you'll be upset.  Not worth that.  This is supposed to be a good thing:  A great sci-fi show that takes itself and its audience seriously.  This splitting the season may upset some people, but please don't let it.  I don't know about any of you but I have waited a long time for a show like this.  I choose to look at it in a positive light.  And yeah, they will get my $40 and then some because I want the message to be heard:  This show is being watched , we want more, and I am putting my money where my mouth is to make that message heard, even in a very small way.

All other negative reviews are from people pissed at Universal for not releasing the full season together....and with good reason.  This is one of the most thought-provoking, well written, character-driven dramas ever.  There is no restart button, no heros, no villians.  This is just a story of people trying to get by, and accomplish their goals.  I've compared it many times to George RR Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series (Martin has recently declared himself to be a fan), because of the sheer humanness of everyone on their.  I don't mean sympathetic villians and flawed heros, I mean NO VILLIANS and NO HEROS.

All I can say is, get this show, but be prepared for something complex.  You should sit down and watch it only when you can watch at least a full episode, uninterrupted, at a time, or you'll become confused.  The story arc is THAT strong.

NOT THIS SEASON 2.0 BULLCRAP!!!

Whatever you do don't support them in this lame idea!! you will only encourage them! Hold out 'till the season's full run!!",1134345600,19,845,4.526315789473684
2429986,1,B000BNI90Y,"The show is great.  It has a lot of character development.  My only hesitancy is that, unlike Babylon 5 (my benchmark comparison), the character development seems forced; like, who knows when we'll be cancelled...let's let everybody know almost everything about everybody quickly.

But, this review is about the release format.  One big black mark for the Amazon reviewer, who refused to take the studio to task for this rip-off.  I can't call it anything else.  We all wait for the series to be released one year at a time.  What's next...one episode at a time?

I do not intend buying this until the year is together, and I encourage all readers to do likewise.  Delay your gratification until the entire year is released.  Or else, we will begin to see similar marketing for other favorite shows.  Let's stop this now!!!",1134259200,27,823,4.807142857142857
2429987,5,B000BNI90Y,"I was genuinely thrilled when I bought this series, relying only on the Amazon reviews that I've been reading.  Its one of my favorite series, along with 24, Lost, and soon to end Alias.  I'll surely grab the new sets for this series going forward.  Its getting quite some bashing because it is releasing half a season worth.  But I think its okay, as this gives some of those who would like to get the series now, an option to watch it now.  And I think its great.  Of coure, the true test is if and when they release a complete season 2 for a good price. If they do, then please, do this all the time, as it gives us all an option to get it sooner than later or wait for a complete set.  If they don't, then I'll join in on the bashing ; )

For now, this gets a 5 star based on the quality of the series.  How gorgeous this series is,  esp. if you have a good widescreen TV!",1134259200,4,876,3.954285714285714
2429988,3,B000BNI90Y,"First off, love love LOVE the new Battlestar Galactica. Diehard fans of the original who dis it are JPC... Just Plain Crazy. Saw the original series as a teenager, trust me, it doesn't even hold a CANDLE to the new version. In fact, the new BSG even puts the later Star Trek series, Voyager and Enterprise, to utter and complete shame (though not NextGen or DS9 during their best years), not to mention Stargate SG Anything. The best sci-fi on television right now, period? Yep, without a doubt.

That said, asking $50 ($35 at Amazon) for a half-season set is too much, which is why I give this product only 3 stars (quality-wise, its 5 stars all the way). A quick an' easy way around this if you're not a video quality freak is to simply DOWNLOAD the ten Season 2 episodes from iTUNES at $1.99 a pop, $19.90 total, courtesy of NBC's recent deal with Apple.

Yes, the resolution on the downloaded episodes is not great (320x240) since they were designed to be used with the video iPod and its small screen. Viewing them full screen on my laptop, well, they're VHS quality at best. And you don't get any extras or deleted scenes (not that the low-featured half-season set has a lot of those).

But you DO get the episodes for around HALF the price of what they're asking for the half-season DVD set. And best of all, you can get 'em right NOW, no waiting (unless you're unfortunate enough to still be on dialup, lol).

Even if you don't particularly like the low-res quality of the downloads, it might be just the thing to tide you over until the full Season 2 set becomes available in a few months, with its no-doubt better set of extras and features than the overpriced, under-featured half season set.

(Note: I would have absolutely NOTHING against the half-season set, if only it were priced appropriately for a HALF season set. Something more like $39 retail, $29 at Amazon would be fair.)

PS-  Since I wrote this review, Amazon has dropped the price to $32... close to a fair price for what you're getting, in my estimation. Still, you would have to be crazy to pay the full-boat retail of $50 they're asking elsewhere.

Here's hoping that greed/overreaching doesn't torpedo some of the fans' enthusiasm for this (so-far) wonderful series. So say we all.",1134259200,6,2261,4.606965174129353

But there is no way I am buying a HALF season of it!  This is nothing but a pathetic cash grab by whoever is in charge of releasing the DVD's.

2430000,3,B000BNI90Y,"I absolutely love the new Battlestar Galactica.  I hated the original series ... never could get into it, but this newer version is intense with wonderfully deep characters (Starbuc, Colonel Tigh and Dr Baltar are my favorites)...  but something is missing in this second season.  Its moving too fast.  There are emotions coming out all over the place from characters that completely catch you off gaurd -- like there wasn't enough character development or something.  The pilot and season one are absolutely fabulous -- worth the price 20Xs over!  However, the writing in season 2 is a bit shoddy.  Its still good but I think had the writing in the second season actually been part of the first season then I may not have gotten as deeply into it as I have.

Worth getting simply because the overall concept and series is great -- but the simplistic writing of the second season leaves much to be desired compared to the pilot and season 1.  It almost seems like the writers have changed.  I'm not sure -- maybe I should go find that out!  ;)",1133654400,5,1043,4.614130434782608
2430001,4,B000BNI90Y,"I think Battlestar Galactica is a pretty good show and I was really surprised at how good the first season set was. The mini-series was even included which really boosted the value. However I'm not sure exactly how much of a good value this is. If you do the math you end up paying seventy dollars for the full set. This is a pretty good idea for sci-fi fans who are looking for good Christmas presents but I wish they'd cut the price on it. You can get a full season of Stargate SG-1 for the same price.

Don't get me wrong season two has been great so far. I was really excited to see how the mutiny on Galactica and the shooting of Adama would work out and so far it hasn't let me down. Pegasus was a great episode that should be nominated for an Emmy and the show itself is getting so pretty good critcal response. I can't wait to see what else is in the future for the survivors of Kobol. As far as this set goes you pretty much have to make up your own mind because some people will set it as a rip-off. It's a great show and if you missed the first half of the second season then this is the perfect way to catch up before the second half premiers in January.",1133568000,8,1166,4.0476190476190474
2430002,5,B000BNI90Y,"The new series has blown the old one away as far as I am concerned.  However if I see Kent Mc Cord and Barry Van Dyke riding flying motorcycles in this series I am going to get worried.  All the hype that was published about Starbuck being a woman and Richard Hatch finally whatever he finally did. Richard Hatch had a reputation for being tempermental and the original BSG was probably the only good series he was in.  Just remember he and Karl Malden were partners after Michael Douglas left Streets of San Francisco which then got cancelled. Then how about Boxie and his robot dog and we can not forget Ray Milland dressed in a toga?  He was definitely my hero.  Then how about the little blonde hooker in the original.  Today's audiences could accept that, but she conveniently became a med tech.

The new Galactica shows a lot of real life. Burnout from being in space too long, hip flasks, a Dr who is chain smoking himself to death.  This new series is not sugar coated for the kiddies.  It is an adult series not a kiddie one like in the past.  Unfortunately life can be gritty.  I really would like a chip planted in my brain that let me have the blonde.

Looking even more you have the double crossing son who just can't seem to stop stabbing his dad in the back, figuratively.  Does anybody wonder about what the first cylons that ""we"" created looked like?  If they were the centaurians with the whirling blade hands and the gattling gun attachments that we see now that presents a pretty bleak future for us good old humans.

2430004,4,B000BNI90Y,"As has been pointed out several times, ""Season 2.0"" is only HALF of Season 2.  Sci-Fi programmed a 3-month hiatus into the schedule so the final 10 episodes will be aired beginning 1/6/06.  If you just have to have this as an Xmas gift this year by all means do so; you'll enjoy the midseason cliffhanger as much as the rest of us PLUS you'll only have to wait a couple of weeks to see it resolved.  It'll probably be cheaper to wait for a complete Season 2 volume to come out, however and there may be added bonus features.

""Season 2.0"" is a bit of misnomer even discounting it's only the first 10 episodes of Season 2.  Sci-Fi didn't pay for a full Season 1 so some of the plot threads from that aren't tied up until Season 2 Episode 5.  In effect what you have are the final 5 episodes of Season 1 plus just *5* episodes of Season 2. However it all works out in some bizarre non-Euclidean fashion.  The episodes pretty much stand on their own merit and you don't need a reference card to keep track of what's going on.  Season 2 is darker, richer, and more plot-driven than Season 1 and the Cylons still have some tricks up their sleeves to show us.  The mid-season cliffhanger is logical, satisfying, and the end and leaves you breathless waiting for the resolution in January.

The good news is that Sci-Fi has already ordered a third season based on the response to the first two and it's likely the series will continue at least 8 seasons before they wind things up. The Colonials now know where Earth is but it's a *long* way off and the Cylons are hot on their heels.

I'll wait until they put the whole season on DVD, or at the very least wait for a package deal of both for the price of one.  I find it an insult when DVD sets are released incomplete and it's such an obvious money soaking scheme.  I see one of two things happening...They are going to release the second half for the same price and offer no whole season set, or they will wait and release the entire season in June.  Although with company greediness for money, they could release the 2 half in April and then come back in August and re-release the entire season with bonus features not available in either half season set.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of the BSG whiners from the original series, cause, personally I think that show stinks to high heaven.  Once they got past a certain part, it turned into a campy boring run and then they reached earth...don't get me started on that sad chapter in the series' life.

This new series is totally amazing and attention grabbing from the very start, although, Baltar's psychosis is starting to get annoying and kinda unbelievable in the fact that no one is questioning him on why he's talking to thin air or a wall at any given point in the storyline.

I'm just crossing my fingers that the commander of the Pegasus will be gone in a couple of episodes, I don't like the actress for one, and, I'm hoping one of her own crew puts an end to her, or at the very least, they find out she's actually a Cylon and Adama gets to take her down and out of our misery.

Once they have made as much as possible from selling two halves of a series I'm sure they will then sell the 'special edition' full series to make even more cash. I for one can wait for the full season rather than buy into this rip off.

I suspect this marketing tactic is being used to create revenue to pay the wages of Lucy Lawless' new character 'D'anna Biers' and Michelle Forbes as commander Cain of The Pegasus.

Living in the UK, myself and other BSG fans are forced to wait until Sky One airs the second season of Battlestar Galactica on Jan 10th,2006 (7 months after the show airs in the States/Canada. Which is cruel and outrageous for UK fans).

I hope the creator Ronald D Moore can regain control of Battlestar Galactica from the Universal bean counters. Need I remind you all of the demise of the X-Files,production relocated to LA combined with the actors delusions of grandeur and fame, the story arc reduced to a joke and a conclusion reminiscient to David S Goyer's butchered Blade 3.

Fans should demand a complete season box set for a reasonable price.

I would like to see more action sequences, particularly in space.

2430014,5,B000BNI90Y,"When the Sci-Fi Channel first announced back in 2003 that it was producing a miniseries version of the original 1978 TV series ""Battlestar Galactica"", I had a lot of doubts about how successful it would be because two of the former main characters were being turned from men into women and because the some of the Cylons were going to appear human.  When I first watched the miniseries back in 2003, my doubts were quickly washed away as the miniseries proved to be compelling, engaging, extremely realistic, emotional, well-acted and had superb special effects.  Due to the huge success of the miniseries, the Sci-Fi Channel decided to produce a TV series based upon its 2003 miniseries.  The first season of the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series aired in 2004 and showed itself to be just as exciting and well made as the miniseries.  The second season of ""Battlestar Galactica"" that aired in 2005 was even more exciting and emotionally intense than the first.

The primary characters in the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" are Commander William ""Husker"" Adama (Edward James Olmos), President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace (Katee Sackhoff), Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber), Doctor Gaius Baltar (James Callis), Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park), the Cylon known as Number Six (Tricia Helfer), Col. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) and Lt. Karl 'Helo' Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett).  Other characters include Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch, who played Apollo in the original 1978 ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series), Chief Petty Officer Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), Crashdown (Sam Witwer) and Crewman Specialist Cally (Nicki Clyne).

The 10 episodes of the second season are as follows:

1. ""Scattered"". With Adama critically injured from the first season finale, Roslin imprisoned and people trapped on Kobol, the inept Col. Tigh takes command of the fleet, but only to lose the fleet when he orders the fleet to jump and the wrong jump coordinates are sent to the civilian fleet. In the meantime, Boomer, whose Cylon identity is well-known, sits in a jail cell on board Galactica while Starbuck becomes trapped on Caprica with Helo after the other Boomer takes her modified Cylon fighter.

2. ""Valley of Darkness"".  A deadly Cylon virus is trying to take over Galactica's computers.  In the meantime, Baltar, Tyrol & the other people on Kobol fight for survival while Starbuck & Helo break into her old apartment on Caprica.

3. ""Fragged"". The survivors on Kobol discover the Cylons are building an danti-aircraft gun while Adama is undergoing dangerous surgery. Not happy with the Quorum of Twelve, Col. Tigh places the fleet under martial law.

4. ""Resistance"".  Galactica personnel open fire on a group of civilians protesting martial law.  Chief is accused of being a Cylon and arrested while Apollo helps Pres. Roslyn to escape confinement on Galactica.  Starback & Helo on Caprica find 53 surviving humans.

5. ""The Farm"".  While the recovering Adama retakes command of the fleet from Col. Tigh, Pres. Roslyn leads a third of the fleet back to Kobol with the promise of finding the way to Earth.  On Caprica, a wounded Starbuck is taken to a strange hospital and makes an unpleasant discovery.

6. ""Home: Part 1"". While Pres. Roslyn has a difficult time leading the civilian ships at Kobol, Starbuck, Helo and Boomer return from Caprica and arrive at Kobol to search for the Tomb of Athena.

7. ""Home: Part 2"". Adama decides to return to Kobol to reunite the fleet and heads to the surface to join Pres. Roslyn and those with her in search of the Tomb of Athena.

8. ""Final Cut"". A reporter, D'Anna Biers (Lucy Lawless), is given a large amount of access to report activities on Galactica.

9. ""Flight of the Phoenix"". While the crew helps Chief to build a brand new fighter named ""The Black Bird"", Adama must put his trust in Boomer to stop a deadly Cylon computer virus that has been infecting Galactica's computers.

10. ""Pegasus"".  The Galactica isn't the only surviving battlestar; the Pegasus also survived under the command of Admiral Helena Cain (Michelle Forbes), who takes command of the civilian fleet and begins to make things so difficult for Adama that a very real fight is a distinct possibility.  What a season cliffhanger!

Overall, I rate the second season of the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.",1130889600,15,4406,5.008230452674897

It's not preachy and it truely doesn't argue for a liberal or conservative viewpoint. To give you an example, every person in my family from my ex-Marine Born again Christian cousin to my new-age liberal sister loves this show.

Beyond the great scripts, the acting on BSG is the best on television today. I promise you this.  Edward James Almos and Mary McDonnell give consistently outstanding lead performances but they are not alone.  Katee Sackoff, Starbuck, is a wonder and Jamie Bamber's American accent is so good that you'll  never even remember that he's British.

I agree with other reviewers who called this show addictive.  I'm totally obsessed and have become the type of fan I always mocked because this show is *that* good.

Watch the mini-series and season one first because you'll get more out of the stories.",1130025600,10,974,4.92638036809816
2430016,4,B000BNI90Y,"This review adresses the entire series, as well as, season 2.  I give it 4 stars only because it's half a season.

  Still, I am glad that they will have the first half available in time for Christmas shopping (not so useful in June). It's nice to see some marketers getting it right for a change, giving us something we actually want when we want it (remember when you had to buy a whole CD to get your single favorite song...hellooo).

  I waded into the mini-series and even season one, quite skeptical. I promised myself I'd give it a chance. I loved the original despite it's frivolity and lack of continuity..I suppose I loved ""the potential"" it had.

  Well, here it is, they fixed it. Simple as that. And as mentioned in another review, though I can't say it is the Best Sci-Fi show ever, (that would arguably be B5), it is definitely living up to a large percentage of the potential this concept offers.

  Season two gets a bit formulaic and a tiny bit frivolous (SPOILER: Cylons can't be detected by doctors or DNA, but they can shove a data feed in their arm and talk to the computer?? Can't be nanobots, we can detect those now.). You start to feel some of the twists happen before they do, and that is a bit of a letdown, but there are still those edge of the seat moments too, just farther between.  At least there are more than 50,000 humans to experiment on now (I mean unless you consider that many more in the fleet are actually cylons).  I, for one, commend the writers for keeping these loose threads to the original series. Though the die-hards will probably have something demeaning to say about that too. I think it's awesome.

  Speaking of which,(SPOILER) who would have thought Lucy Lawless was a Cylon model? Um, guys, do you realize you revealed a cylon model that you might not be able to get back in a year or two. What's the point in having a throw away Cylon revelation? It's a twist yeah, but with only 15 or so potential actor roles out there, that gives about 3 seasons worth of surprises, then maybe they'll have to get polymer-plastic surgery??

  Anyway, Rock On new Galactica!",1129939200,3,2116,4.472584856396867
2430017,5,B000BNI90Y,"Hey, for those of you who won't give the new Battlestar Galactica a chance because you liked the old one, I can only say your loss. . .this is in my opinion, the best show EVER CREATED! Season one was AWSOME, but season Two just got even better. This show is beyond awsome! It has EVERYTHING a good Sci-Fi show should have: GREAT scripts, GREAT acting, GREAT action and GREAT special FX. The acting is WONDERFUL, expecially by Mary McDonnel and Edward James Olmos. Im TOTALY addicted to this show, and the last episode of season two just about gave me a heart attack it was so exciting! So, if you give it a chance, you won't regret it. For about half of the episodes in both seasons, my heart was beating out of my chest! As long as they don't ruin a good thing, Im all for more and more seasons. So far, they could not have done a better job on the show. EXPECIALLY season two. I don't know what that guy who rated season two so low was doing while it was playing. . .dude, were you asleep? That could explain why you didn't care for it. . .",1129939200,3,1043,4.1683168316831685
2430018,5,B000BNI90Y,"I have yet to see anyone give reference to Sci-Fi genius Phillip K Dick for the concept of human/android/enemies that all come from one of only a few models. Check out the Phillip K Dick Reader for the original story ""Number Three"" (most of the best Sci-Fi was written before Star Wars, with the obvious exception of the New Battlestar Galactica, which is pure genius!!!)",1129766400,4,371,4.723076923076923
2430019,5,B000BNI90Y,"I am not a big fan of the sci-fi genre and shows with weird aliens and inter-galatic wars turn me off big time.  However Battlestar is far from a typical sci-fi show, it's more of a deep and dark tale about human survival and politics than anything else.  The acting and writing is top notch and each episode there is a feeling of impending doom which is uncommon in today's tv landscape of neatly tied up procedural crime shows.  This is show easily tops anything the networks have to offer and is the best show period that's not named the Wire, Deadwood or the Sopranos.",1129766400,7,572,4.428571428571429
2430020,4,B000BNI90Y,"Watching the original series as a child in the 70's I knew it was insipid dreck. As did the rest of the country, hence it's rapid cancellation. The writing was so bad as to be insulting, even to a child. Which is why I have been so pleasantly surprised by this updated version.

They've taken the same premise and actually put intelligence and talent behind it. This is a VAST IMPROVEMENT over the original. An affecting, and smart human drama that happens to be couched in science fiction. While not every episode is perfect, even the least are head and shoulders above most of what passes for drama on television. So.............DO NOT LET A (reasonable) AVERSION TO THE 70'S SERIES cause you to miss what is one of the best written shows on television.",1129593600,8,755,4.634328358208955
2430021,5,B000BNI90Y,"It's bizarre, really.

I mean, I have checked out quite a few critically acclaimed television shows in my day and, almost uniformly, I've found the high praise to be excessive and unwarranted. So it is with shock and sharp relief that I now find myself all wrapped up in not just a T.V. show, not just a science fiction T.V. show, but a revamp of a T.V. show from the 1970s.

To be fair, I still have a soft spot for the old Battlestar Galactica, even though it has aged poorly with hippie star frocks, alien casinos and white-fro bimbos and the same eight effect shots replayed over and over, sometimes flipped left to right to retrieve an extra angle from previous work. Yeah, it's cheese but it is fun cheese; a childhood guilty pleasure.

The new series however has nothing to do with the fantasies of childhood. Here we have all the foibles and pitfalls of very real human characters (even the robot ones) played out on a fantastic canvas. We have the madness, disease, sex, violence, familial tension and even the humor that real people might experience if we were placed in such times of desperation. There are no moon-eyed children with their robot dogs and the enemies seem to have a more complex reason for their actions beyond just hating those fleshy folks.

In other words, the new Battlestar Galactica has everything you might want in an honest-to-God television drama, and some exciting visual effects too. Things blow up and make ""pretty boom-boom"", but visceral destruction is not the r'aison d'etre. Is it enough to finally make me forsake free broadcast television and spring for cable? No way. The good ""mother-@%^&*&"" at HBO and CineMAX have not offered anything that convincing to me yet (Sorry, Tony S., but I'm just not that into you)... But it is the first series in a very long time that I can see myself buying DVD sets for, waiting for the next to surface with baited breath.

I would add that this is a resounding endorsement for you to do the same.

2430022,5,B000BNI90Y,"Battlestar Galactica showed me something interesting about myself.

I watched it on TV in the seventies and was all gaga over it, having watched it again on DVD on my modern setup I saw it for what it was to me, it played on four of my weaknesses - or themes if you prefer - in SCI-FI.

1 Egyptology - the possibility that the pyramids were build by an advanced society.

2 No aliens - the possibility that we ARE alone in this universe however unlikely that may seem considering the size of our play pen, leading to point 3.

3 The human race with its back against the wall - only 50,000 sentient beings left in the entire Universe - not counting the possibilities within the Cobol legend.

4 The clincher, Is it possible that we are no more than a gestation phase for something else, the egg is destroyed when the chick hatches, we are the egg, the cylons are the chick, we are surplus to requirement.

Unbeknownst to me at the time, that is what Battlestar Galactica is (not was) to me.

But there were things missing and wrong with the show back then, both can be blamed on all of us now being quarter of a century older and that, especially, includes the entertainment industry, special effects, script writing and so on coming of age.

The one big thing that was missing was Angst.

In the new series they have rightly thrown away the ""light family entertainment"" feel and replaced it with a dark, brooding feeling of desperation which threads it's way through the people and their actions, no one knows what to do, including the leaders (So what's new), it is their training and discipline that carries them through every time but it is still no more than a knee jerk reaction to jet another emergency.

This is an unprecedented situation where Billions upon Billions of souls, both future and past, are looking upon a mere 50,000 to pull it off and build again or fail and the entire human history would have been for nothing only leaving a legacy of artificial intelligence.

I get emotionally involved with Battlestar Galactica, I shed a tear at the smile on Roswell's face as she turned towards the camera after marking up the birth of a child.

Perhaps there is hope after all.

IF this is your cuppa tea, Battlestar Galactica (the new series) is a bit of a trap, there is only one way to watch it.

Alone, from end to end (DVD not TV), after you have send the missus and kids to Siberia for the duration, yanked the Phone out the wall and barricaded the door, windows and pulled the blinds, you think I an kidding, it demands your full attention, if you sneeze you will need to rewind because you will have missed something.

A fellow faithful had strayed from the path after he watched a couple of episodes on TV and thought it sucked, it turned out he had not seen the Mini series and based his views on that snapshot, I loaned him my collection and he is now re-converted and owns his own collection and like myself has placed an order for this first half of season 2.

You ever wondered why they canned Startrek partway through a series, well here is your answer.

In a previous post a grumble was made of an ledged attempt by Universal to make more money.

Allow me to gently point out that the average Startrek retails for around 100 dollars for 24 episodes per season whereas BG retails for 35 dollars for a 10 episode half season.

The sums say that Startrek costs you $4.17 per episode and BG cost you $3.50 per episode, not to bad pricing I thought granted thought it does seem a bit odd until you think like me.

I do not watch TV AT ALL, I hate, with a passion, advertising of any form so my set-up is for watching movies only therefore I need to wait till seasons end before I can catch up with the latest goings on in BG, you get my drift, Universal are doing the likes of me a favor, intentionally or not.",1129248000,6,3833,4.379407616361072
