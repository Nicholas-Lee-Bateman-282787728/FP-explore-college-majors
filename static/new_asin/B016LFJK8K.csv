8736697,3,B016LFJK8K,"Be sure to get the 20th Century Fox version, and not some third generation reprint (this film has fallen into the public domain). When you see the Technicolor cinematography, you'll be glad you spent a little more for some of the most beautiful colors to grace the silver screen. You can easily see why it was nominated for Best Color Cinematography. The story itself sways greatly from the Hemingway short story (a lot more story had to be fabricated to reach the length of a feature film) and for a movie set in Africa and Spain, with scenes of safaris, bullfights and civil war, it suffocates in too much talk too much of the time.",1514332800,3,634,4.521739130434782
