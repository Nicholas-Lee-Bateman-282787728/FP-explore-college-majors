1786655,4,B00006LPHF,"I like to buy the various compilations of short gay films because you get a variety of perspectives and ideas. Unfortunately all too often the selections are uneven, with only one or two standouts per. This collection is one of the better ones. Artistically, the films are each pretty well done, adopting a style and point of view and following it through. The content of these films, though somewhat varied (although connected by the theme of ""first lust"")was pretty consistantly good. I enjoyed the whole collection. I won't go into details, as the other reviews take care of that, but I will recommend this DVD.
The introductions by Danny Roberts (and I really do like you, Danny) were pretty weak. The scripts are flat, as is Danny's delivery (why do people think they have to be unnatural when acting?). But it was fun to see him in various states of undress and away from that Real World crowd.",1044835200,10,900,4.7025316455696204
1786656,4,B00006LPHF,"""Boys Briefs 2"" is a collection of six non-USA gay-oriented short films from 1999-2002.  The movies and their framing introductions are much better than in the first ""Boys Briefs.""
If one plays all the movies through, they are each given a hotter and less wordy introduction (this time by Danny Roberts of MTV fame) than happened in the first ""Boys Briefs.""  One can play each movie separately without any introduction.  There are substantial skin scenes in all but ""Chicken"".  There are English subtitles for the films from Spain and Germany; the rest are in English already.
""Doors Cut Down"" (""En Maias Companias""; Antonio Hens; Spain; 17 minutes) shows 18-ish Guillermo as a skilled predator in a the bathroom of a Madrid-area mall.  Guillermo casts his net a bit wider and attracts the attention from the police and his parents.  Still, things have a way of changing and working out too.  This was the most fun feature and had a catchy thematic beat.
""Chicken"" (Barry Dignam; Ireland; 3 minutes) shows two guys between the train tracks and the beach trying out each other's courage and affection.  Effective for the time spent.
""Back Room"" (Guillem Morales; Spain; 13 minutes) is a dark, anonymous place upstairs from a Spanish gay dance club that five major (and several background minor) characters go for quick sex.  There's a first-timer, a punk, a hottie, a hunk, and an older man.  They go through their motions, but the audience gets to hear their much less mechanical thoughts along the way.  I liked the movie maybe too much; I found myself redoing parts and thinking about how to embed it in a longer movie that would show the characters before and after.
""Breakfast"" (""Fruestueck""; Alexander Pfeuffer; Germany; 14 minutes) has romantic, Berlin newcomer Boris (Nico Link) trying to keep a hold on impulsive, promiscuous Till (Tobias Schenke). Till's friend, Giselle (Anna Thalbach), offers breakfasts.  Can they help?  This is a nice, romantic comedy.
""Touch"" (Jeremy Podeswa; Canada; 27 minutes) is the most serious and, for me, the most memorable of the six films.  A boy is locked in a basement and abused from the time he is eight years old until he is sixteen.  When the doors open, the boy is free to leave.  Upon leaving a hospital, he is given a name and lives with foster parents.  Not given any further treatment, his past continues to drive his future.  Brendan Fletcher gives an amazing performance as the sixteen-year old ""Richard"".  The grainy photography fits well with the deadened sensibility and the shadowy faces used.  Daniel Janke's dissonant music for violin and prepared piano fits perfectly and is performed well by pianist Janke and by violinist Mark Fewer.  Five stars out of five.
""Take-Out"" (Jean-Francois Monette; Canada; 37 minutes) was sponsored by Quebec and features road signs in French, although the characters all speak English.  High school student Rory (Gianpaolo Venuta) delivers chicken dinners for Chalet Bar-B-Q.  One day he delivers to Pete (Daniel MacIvor), a lawyer in a big house and with time on his hands.  Rory keeps being asked back, and the tips keep getting bigger.  Fellow worker Enzo (Benjamin Plener) and Pete's wife(?) Virginia (Kaya McGregor) are starting to ask questions.  Rory has wandering eyes in the school shower and is looking at some interesting magazines in the rack.  What happens next?  This was the most finished looking movie of the lot and had fine acting throughout.  There were parts worth reconsidering on repeat viewings.
The biggest drawback to the DVD was that there were no director's commentaries to any of the movies.  I enjoy commentaries as a way to learn about movie-making and about how other cultures handle matters.  Another annoyance was that the first three movies do not show linkages between the actors' names and the parts they play; one can try to guess by who appears first or speaks first or is the most important.
Still, this is a very enjoyable collection of films from outside the USA.",1040947200,40,3997,4.956456456456457

7972230,4,B00006LPHF,"Been several years that this collection has been on my list to buy.  Glad that the dvd finally is here.  Overall, each of the short clips are well done, each with a distinctive style, several coming from other countries.  One more to buy, Boys Briefs 4, and I will have the entire group.  Overall a good addition to my collection.",1378339200,,330,4.45
7972231,5,B00006LPHF,"I was interested in this film and would recommend it to others of you who have an interest in the subject matter.
I look forward to more films of this type.",1376956800,,156,4.064516129032258
7972232,1,B00006LPHF,"Not the sort of film i would wright home about, a bit smutty and crass. But it does show some seedy venues and gay avenues.
I think one is putting oneself at risk visiting these places, and not using safe sex practices etc.
This is one DVD I would not recommend to anybody let alone gay people as I'm sure they could even turn straight, if this is the type of gay sex portrayed as the norm..",1348185600,,391,4.090909090909091
7972233,3,B00006LPHF,"This is the 2nd installment in the Boys Briefs series.  All-in-all, it is just like the first DVD.  The only difference is in the individual stories themselves.  Because the tales are so diverse, it is impossible to characterize DVD 1 or DVD 2 except to say that you will probably like at least a couple of the episodes.  On this particular DVD, the first story was my favorite.  A Spanish college student cruises the mall and gets figured out by his parents when they see him involved in too many gay situations.  At one point, his father catches him having sex with an English tutor.  The ""caught in the act"" scene is about as graphic as Brian & Justin making love in Queer as Folk.  Except for this first story, I do not remember any graphic sex.

I stick by my advice for the first DVD:  buy this one used and don't spend more than seven bucks.  I got it for $3 at a thrift store.",1317859200,,884,4.265060240963855
7972234,2,B00006LPHF,"Oh what a major disappointment. I liked Boy's Briefs (one) but 2 was a very low budget, poor production containing mostly dark and sadistic tales. The first short on this film is ""DOORS CUT DOWN"" a story of a young man who frequents restrooms at malls and other places picking up all sorts of men. There are a few hot moments in this one that wasn't bad, but overall the plot left a lot to be desired. Next up was a 3 min. short of two boys ""CHICKEN"" which was all about one boy trying to break the ice with another and touch him just to let him know he was interested in him. ""BACKROOM"" was number three. It is about a bunch of guys hanging around a back room in a nightclub having sex with whosoever walked by. They never spoke to each other except in their mind fantasizing what they WANTED to say but didn't have the guts. A few moments of promise but those promises were shattered before it was over. ""BREAKFAST"" was alright as story number four about two guys trying to get together but one wanted a relationship. The other was a whore who just wanted sleazy sex with whoever wanted it. This short could have gone somewhere as well, but failed to do so. The real choker of this whole compilation is: ""TOUCH"". This is a very dark, sadistic narrative of a boy kidnapped at 8 years of age, who spent 8 years never seeing his capture, but having very abusive sexual encounters with him in the dark. He slept on a cold floor and was used to having food slid under the door to him and being beated on a regular basis. He couldn't even have the strength to participate in the abusive relationship. He longed for the beatings and abuse as it was all he knew that he could call ""love"". He is finally freed one day and cannot adjust to reality. He still wants to be beaten and abused and seeks to find himself back in the abusive cage he came from. This is purely SICK, TWISTED and PERVERTED. Someone wrote this from a very dark heart, obviously trying to express their deepest fantasies of abusing children. I was not at all impressed. The only real highlight of Boys Briefs 2, is that last sketch called ""TAKE-OUT"" about an 18 year old gay guy who has yet to have his first experience with a partner. For that matter it implies he hasn't even taken matters into his own hands before, until the frustration gets so fiece he can't stand it anymore. It's at that moment when he finally finds some peace to his situation. He is a delivery boy for a barbeque joint and falls for a regular customer to whom he delivers. A man who is known to be gay and makes it somewhat obvious to him as well. But once again, by the time he finds peace to pursue his desire, the man has sold his home and moved. I really didn't find much to hold onto throughout this whole video. The VHS quality is very poor, and tracking wouldn't even clear it up, photography was not great, sound was ok for the most part. The whole thing is hosted by Danny Roberts who is hot enough and maybe even a little too hot to be associated with this production. He used a hand held microphone to narrate, showing the low budget of the production and overall, I can't honestly recommend this one to anyone. If you are at the home of someone who owns this and want to see it, go ahead and give it a try, but save your money. It's not worth paying for. It might however be a lot better quality on DVD, I don't know. I got the VHS version and I'm convinced that was probably part of the probelm. The acting is pretty good. The cast has some rather attractive young men in it, especially ""Rory"" in the last segment. He's worth watching and there is also a steamy shower scene in the same short that ain't bad at all. I'll give it two stars just for Rory and the shower scene. The rest of it get a generous 1/2 star.",1160438400,,3766,4.2465181058495824
7972235,4,B00006LPHF,"All together I thought the stories on the DVD were good; the most noteable, (and in my opinion the best story) being Doors Cut Down.  The lead actor Israel Rodriguez was outstanding and more than believable in the role.
The Pizza Delivery story was also good, as well as the short Irish story that just begins to take shape and then ends for no apparent reason. I know it was a short movie, but hey three minutes just didn't cut it.
Danny Roberts of MTV Real World fame who hosted the movies got better as the stories moved along but he seemed a little uneasy throughout, better luck next time.  All in all I would give the DVD 4 stars based mostly on the strength of the first story Doors Cut Down.",1045958400,13,699,4.287878787878788
