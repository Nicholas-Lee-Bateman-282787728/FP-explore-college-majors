1780336,4,B00006JDTN,"This is 1972, so pretty much the movie quality is still in the raw state, and this is especially so with Christian movies. However, it's done up very well with the dream sequences of the main character Patty who seems to be rather burnt out on what she calls religion as her pastor is just spinning out rhetoric that doesn't seem to bring up the ultimate message, and that's the Gift of Salvation which is only available by making Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior. Patty is trying to search for answers as she's a young lady, and has her life turned upside down with peer pressure, love, and then the fact that she doesn't want to accept Jesus while her husband does, and then the ultimate nightmare happens when the rapture occurs. This is scary stuff, and it was done very well.",1118620800,3,781,4.468531468531468
1780337,1,B00006JDTN,"I remember this movie as it came out in 1973,how could I ever forget it as it was also used in my church when I was a child as a so called ""Witnessing tool"" now as an adult I can see it for what it really was ...A scare tactic to get one to believe and if I didn't I would be ""Left behind to go to hell"".

The tool worked well as I would have panic attacks till I was the age of 36. Some have mentioned in the reviews that the movies special affects are amateurish at best.. But remember during the seventies many people weren't as desensitized from watching the television shows and on screen movies of that time as they are in this day with all the special affects etc,and I can see why they would say that. I would say if you home school your children and monitor the types of TV programs they watch then by all means..do NOT let them see this movie or you can have the same type of reaction.

As a side note after studying the Bible for years (in both Hebrew & Greek) because of the reaction I Had to this movie I can say honestly I don't believe in the so called ""rapture"" anymore as I HAD TO KNOW if it was a just a theory  and just where this theory came from so I studied and found out that the theory was and is only 150 years old and makes Christianity into an escapism religion and for you who don't believe it here where the theory came from.

The Encyclopedia Britannica, volume 12, 1966 issue, pages 648-649, describes Edward Irving and the controversy over his teachings in Scotland and England in the early 1800's. He was a member of the Irvingite movement; also known as the Catholic Apostolic Church and he was excommunicated by the London presbytery, and in 1833 was condemned and deposed from the ministry of the Church of Scotland because of his teaching concerning ""the sinfulness of Christ's humanity"". He also began to teach a new theory: the ""rapture/taking out of the Church"", after a young Scottish lass by the name of Margaret MacDonald went into a trance and described a vision in which she said she saw the saints leaving the earth at the return of the Lord, before the tribulation.

Her trance and vision took place in the spring of 1830, while living in Port Glasgow, Scotland. Her ""revelation"" was recorded in a book written by R. N. Norton and printed in London in 1861. Prior to this time, the Church, clear back to the Apostles, had always preached that the Church would go victoriously through the tribulation. There is no record of the ""escape rapture"" theory being preached before 1830. On April 30, 1831, a Mrs. J. B. Cardale, who later joined Irving's church, had uttered a personal revelation in a home prayer meeting, echoing Margaret MacDonald's revelation of a pre-tribulation rapture.

It was from this supposed revelation that the modern doctrine and modern phraseology respecting it arose. It didn't come from any Christian Scripture, but from that which falsely pretended to be the Spirit of G-d. Edward Irving accepted this teaching, and it was taught at prophetic meetings at Powerscourt House in Ireland, attended much by Plymouth Brethren organizer John Darby.

 Irving's views influenced Darby, C. H. Mackintosh, and C. I. Scofield (whose Bible notes popularized this new theory). So it was a young Scottish girl who originated this idea, and is so recorded on page 15 of Norton's book on the Catholic Apostolic Church. Darby, Scofield along with Clarence Larkin and his charts began to teach this new theory, and in the early 1900's it reached a peak in popularity.

Please people before you take anything as the word of G-D RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH! as anytime ""FEAR"" is used as a tool to make an individual believe a certain way or make them believe as a group does. Something is way wrong if they do that.

I have since left the Christian faith and converted to Judaism and am so very happy.  No fear.. peace of mind and I know without a shadow of a doubt that G-d loves me. and for those that think Judaism is a faith based on ""works"" you then don't know squat about the faith and only what's been regurgitated down from Christian pulpits.

1780338,5,B00006JDTN,"Having finally purchaased and the Thief In The Night collection earlier on this year, having watched and loved more current prophecy classics such as Apocalypse 1-4, The Moment After, Left Behind 1 &2, SIX: the Mark Unleashed and the Gathering, I have to say that the entire series deserves a 5 simply for paving the way for and inspiring many of the later prophecy movies(including those that I've just mentioned), and for having a 70's to 80's, MOD Squad & Knightrider-ish feel that you have to love. TRUE, the production, action, acting, and efx were amateur at best, but the message is POWERFUL, the stroyline is captivating, and let's face it, this series has elements of all of the more recent prophecy films and books(Apocalypse, Left Behind, Omega Code,etc) rolled into one. So I have one word for this whole series...FOUNDATIONAL!!!",1096243200,10,841,4.971631205673759
1780339,5,B00006JDTN,I was 12 yrs old the first time I viewed this movie.  I remember being scared to death that it would happen to me.  I was 15 yrs old when I became a Christian.  During the alter service the scenes from this movie and its sequels rolled through my mind and I knew I did not want to go through the things I had seen portrayed.  This movie has made such an impact on my life and I wish every one could see it at least one time in their life.  I believe the world would be a much better place.  You will not regret your purchase of this or the rest of the series.,1089244800,15,559,3.8173913043478263
1780340,3,B00006JDTN,"Forget the LEFT BEHIND movies, this is the genuine B-grade Christian horror film of all time. I'm still a Christian, tho no longer a Rapturist, and I gotta admit the THIEF IN THE NIGHT series still packs a wallop. It's cheaply made, amateurishly acted, and simplistically written, but it has a profound raw  earnestness of sheer primal emotional power.  Same with the three sequels A DISTANT THUNDER, IMAGE OF THE BEAST and PRODIGAL PLANET.
The only such movies to come close-  Michael Tolkin's THE RAPTURE (starring Mimi Rogers & David Duchovny- NOT a C'tian
production *L* - a well-deserved R but must-viewing for mature C'tians); and Parts 2-4 of Cloud Ten Production's Apocalypse series- REVELATION (Jeff Fahey & Carol Alt), TRIBULATION (Gary Busey, Margot Kidder, Howie Mandel-?!?!) & JUDGMENT (Corbin Bersen, Mr. T), tho skip the original APOCALYPSE unless you're a completist.",1089244800,5,883,5.204225352112676
1780341,5,B00006JDTN,"I was 16 when I saw this movie for the first time. It cleared up a lot of questions I had about why a person must be ""Saved"". I made a decision for Christ shortly afterward.
Since I have watched all four and consider the cornerstone of any Christian media library as it is a reminder of what is in store for this world and us. The thing that gets me the most is that what these other reviewers fail to understand (and it is not their fault) is that Christians watch a Christian film not for its originality (the story is over 2000 years old!)and its ability to appeal to all audiences at all times however (It is a Christian Ministry Tool!), it is always been the message. The story line and entertainment is just a welcome add on.
These same reviewers could probably say that the Passion of The Christ film was a ""rehash"" of older Biblical movies and it was not done in a certain manner to suit a particular segment of the population yet it is one of the most highest grossing movies of all time. We are not embarrassed of these films; we embrace them and enjoy them.
I recommend this film to all. Use it as a ministry tool for the youth. I was 15 when I first saw these films in 1995 so they are as much relevant now as they were then.",1085702400,5,1237,4.158333333333333
1780342,5,B00006JDTN,"Back in the 70's one of the few ways you could watch Christian movies were at the Christian drive-in.( Everyone would wait until the loud intro music to pop their brews.)These movies were very cheaply made but The Thief In The Night always drew the biggest crowds. When the movie was finished a preacher would appear to preach and ask for money. What does this have to do with the movie? Plenty! The whole movie is a classic time portal to the early 70's, which not to be confused with the late disco 70's. In Left Behind when you were raptured you left in your birthday suit. In Thief you took you bell-bottoms,  heaven would not be heaven without your soft, broken-in jeans.",1081555200,4,676,4.495934959349594
1780343,5,B00006JDTN,"Made in 1972, A Thief in the Night has been an endless source of embarrassment for Christians, and a righteous 76 minutes of entertainment for the perpetually stoned. This film was the first in a series of 4 films made by Mark IV Pictures about the Book of Revelation and the alleged ""end times"" predicted by evangelical Christians. Not the ""best"" of the series, but it does entertain without dragging on too much.
A solid introduction to characters we will meet up with in the rest of series is made in this film; and the early 70's fashion statements of hardcore handlebar moustaches, and polyester EVERYTHING are abundant.
The film literally hurls us into an ""evil world"", where God's spirit has been taken away along with the Christians in the ""Rapture."" The once benevolent ""United Nations"" has now turned into ""UNITE"" under the Antichrist and has initiated a one world government hell-bent on punishing those who resist the mark of 666.
The story centers around one young woman and her group of friends, some of which disappeared with the Rapture, and some......who are part of this new world order and plotting her demise. I took particular interest in the young preacher man who was later taken in the Rapture; many of his scenes show this wiley young preacher dressed in the shortest daisy dukes I have ever seen in my life. Pay special attention to the mowing scene during the Rapture, when he's dressed only in his daisy dukes and nothing else.
Is it worth your time to watch, let alone buy this film? The answer is yes, in fact, you should see the whole series if you can; and of course, renting is always better than buying if you can find this series. I say WHEAT, definitely WHEAT for this film and the whole series of Mark IV films; they are all highly entertaining in my opinion. You mileage may vary, but I don't think you will walk away disappointed if you buy. These films are underground classics, long hidden but not forgotten in the closets of embarrassed Christians.
Mark IV Pictures Prophecy Pack, and you get: A THIEF IN THE NIGHT, A DISTANT THUNDER, IMAGE OF THE BEAST,THE PRODIGAL PLANET with Tribulation Map. I have the tribulation map and put it to good use every day tracking world events, hallelujah!",1076716800,6,2232,4.696428571428571
1780344,3,B00006JDTN,"I saw this movie first when I was ten years old, and already I had been studying biblical prophecies for years.  These films did something I'd not quite expected . . . they revealed what life would be like for Christians who were left behind.
  Now, to begin, these movies were already cheesy when I saw them in 1986.  I knew they were based in the seventies because I'd seen similiar clothing and hairstyles in movies and photographs.  (which is logical, considering that the seventies were also the era of the Jesus movement, though I grant Jesus Christ, Superstar, far more credit than I grant this movie and its delightful, if overly preachy, sequels).
  Of the film set, this one is clearly the most honest of them.  Patty gets a taste of what it's like to learn her husband Jim, who (big shock, huh,) only became a Christian the night before.  The film first takes us into Patty's past, then into the ""future.""
  Before, I thought Patty was merely traumatized and angry.  With such a situation, I wouldn't be shocked at all to be that way myself.  Still, I thought she was largely paid to scream (indicating a good reason for her assisting cast to be present.)  But my mother had gotten so angry with Patty that she forbade us from then on to say hamburger and Patty in the same sentence.
  At last, I have seen the light and turned away from the christian path.  But I continued my studies of the bible.  I have also attained an adoration for the honesty of horror films. (Perhaps I have read too much Camille Paglia.) Anyhow, with my christian blinders dispelled, I can now understand Patty's panic, rage, and disgust much more clearly.
  This is good for anyone who 1) desires a good scare, 2) can tolerate being preached at constantly, 3) enjoys films about the end of the world.  (In a way, these films are somewhat variations on the Romero zombie films.)  4) Doesn't get the point of Left behind (which I found boring) and wants to get the original source.",1065916800,3,1968,4.547008547008547
1780345,4,B00006JDTN,"This movie is important in that it began the whole Christian apocalyptic genre.  In 1972 Thief in the Night was cutting-edge church drama.  Of course the acting seems a bit stiff, the dialogue forced, the message delivered without a hint of sublety.  However, this effort served as a catalyst for the many sophisticated media presentations of a popular Christian view of how the world as we know it ends (and begins).
I remember seeing Thief in the Night roughly a quarter of a century ago--how it inspired me to greater dedication, and how a number people became serious about their faith for the first time.
Seeing The film today is akin to watching some of the earliest Star Trek episodes.  The dated styles, the archiac technology, and the paper-shuffling government authorities are fun to remember.  Yet, in spite of the 30 years that have passed since its production, Thief in the Night's message remains timely.
Perhaps the reintroduction of the Thief in the Night series will garner new appreciation for such modern productions as Left Behind, and the Apocalypse series.  Religious producers still do not have the budgets and tools available on the scale Hollywood uses.  Nevertheless, meaningful messages are being meaningfully done.
Bottom-line:  Thief in the Night will prove most interesting to Christians who came of age in the 70s and 80s.  The acting is stiff, but not sloppy.  The message lacks nuance, but communicates clearly and realistically.  As a pioneer effort in the genre, the movie earns a solid 4 stars.",1054598400,43,1530,5.007905138339921

1780354,5,B00006JDTN,Excellent film. Let Me 1st say that I wish someone would remake it so that it's more relevant to the world we see today in terms of clothing cars etc. But I've seen it several times my beautician used it as a ministry tool when she did hair at the house and Even though it's from the 60's or 70's Era of film making  I finally began to like it. It's a great way to teach end time right now times Revelation. I recommend it for bible study classes small groups etc. Children will not grasp it because it's so old in my opinion. I was a teenager and I finally understood n it as an adult watching it over and over. I also recommend it as a gift to pass on when finished. Very good to realize the intensity of getting right with Gideon before it's too late. I also recommend the left behind series.

He went up in the rapture and his friends and this lady who became his wife were left behind dealing with an Army ranned under Satons power. This Army is called The Anti Christ.

In spite of being a low budget movie, it might not be a perfect one, but it surely transmits perfectly the idea of it. It's a very strong movie, you can cry, feel worried, laugh a bit, be on the edge of your seat!! Pretty cool, though not for anyone. If you plan to show it to unbelievers, I strongly recommend you take some time in prayer before you show it to them. Unbelievers can easily believe after this movie, it goes straight to the point, no beating around the bushes; but you should take prayer first, then show it to them. I recommend prayer and you watching it for yourself, then you decide.

VERY straighforward, plain and simple, talks about the rapture. It seems 70s acted, but the message is really powerful that people won't care the movie is from the 70s or anything about the time it was shot. Definetly a keeper, and it's a part of a 4 series movies!!!

I remember seeing this film for the first time at a church showing in Argentina when I was about 5 or 6, and didn't pay attention to it, as I was too young to fully understand it. But then I saw it again here in the U.S. also at a church showing when I was 8 and was scared out of my wits! That, and the fact that all our pastor ever preached about was Bible prophecy and the rapture really did it for me. I couldn't sleep for days, and then I was constantly scared that the rapture would happen and I'd be left behind. It literally took me years to recover. I couldn't even hear the theme song from the movie because my heart would start pounding and I'd get spooked about everything. When they'd show it privately or at church, I'd refuse to see it. I din't see it again until I was about 16 and even then it still spooked me. Oh man! That really is some movie. I'm an adult now, and of course, I know better. I'm a Christian and own all 4 of the movies in the series, along with every other rapture/end-times movie out there (like the ""Apocalypse"" and ""Left Behind"" movies)and scores of books, both fiction and non ficton (like ""Left Behind""), on the subject. I became a devout student of prophecy myself and have taught it, preached about it, and lectured on it many times. I now look forward to the rapture because I know now that I won't be left behind, since I have given my life to Christ. As you can tell, this movie is a great attention getter, and while by today's standards it is outdated and amateourish, the message is clear and well presented and can lead people to search more until they eventually find what they are looking for. I consider this a Christian movie classic, and I'm quite satisfied to keep it in my DVD collection (though I still don't watch it that often... brings back memories... :-) ).",1169078400,9,1830,4.276657060518732
1780408,3,B00006JDTN,"This movie was commonly shown in churches in the 1970's, and frightened many non-believers so badly that some of them did begin to consider their own spiritual condition and come to salvation. I was one of those people, having seen the film in a Pentecostal church with my then best friend back in high school in 1974. I was raised in a Methodist church that seldom spoke of salvation and never spoke of the rapture, so the entire concept presented in the film was new to me at the time.

Thus, I guess you could say this film did some good in the fact that some were brought to Christ either as a direct or indirect result of watching it. However, it does tend to rock already saved ones into a sense of complacency in relation to the doctrine of the rapture of all Christians prior to the great tribulation, when a careful study of the Bible shows that this is not the case. In that sense, the film does a disservice.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the acting is B-rated, but that is not really the point of the movie. It was not trying to break box office records or win awards. I haven't seen this film in over thirty years, but the memory that still stands out the most to me is that of the heroine of the film going to church on Sunday, trying to find something of the spiritual experience her new husband has found, and being treated instead to a very dead dull sermon. After the rapture, she goes to the church and finds the tormented preacher who has also been left behind lamenting - ""Another one!"". In other words, apparently large numbers of his paritioners as well as himself have never known Christ's salvation.

From a psychological standpoint you have to ask yourself why this film is so frightening. Most people, especially Americans, have been taught their whole lives about the torments of hell that await those who die unredeemed, yet nothing seems to frighten people more than the idea of being left on earth by God to be hunted and persecuted by their fellow man. This is probably because most people have never seen an actual demon, but they have seen plenty of the evil man is capable of, and it is therefore more real to them.",1163116800,5,2156,4.467005076142132
1780409,5,B00006JDTN,"You will either LOVE this movie and find it revealing in terms of the prophecies of the Bible--or--you will HATE this movie and see it as Christian fundamentalism.

Study the prophecies of the Bible for youself. Learn for yourself what God says in His word and compare what this film reveals and decide for yourself.

In comparison with the book of Revelation of the New Testament, I found this movie to be quite indicative of the scriptures. Yes, this is a low-budget film, as many Christian films were of that day, but the sincere message of Christ's warning for us to be ready is quite clear.

We are all free to choose for or against Christ (we have that right naturally) but I would rather be temporarily SCARED NOW and know the TRUTH of God's Word through a film like this one than be FRIGHTENED UNTO DEATH after having missed the rapture; only to face a world without God and with only a small chance of survival.

Even if you don't believe in God, our world system is becoming one gigantic comglomerate that no one can deny. We are moving closer and closer to a one-world monetary system, a one-world religion and ultimately a one-world goverment. That alone................is obvious to anyone---Christian or not.

Salvation is free and the price of rejecting God is too expensive. You can accept Christ and let Him work in and through your life OR you can reject Christ and die without God and pay for your own sins by your own choice. God would HAVE SENT HIS SON TO DIE FOR YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU EVER MADE A DECISION TO CHOOSE FOR HIM. He loves you that much!",1160870400,11,1571,4.517605633802817
1780410,5,B00006JDTN,"People always attempt to rationalize and blame things and others - always trying to find the `easy' way out of being a Christian. Because it's not `convenient' to be one, they find something or someone else to blame. ""This movie traumatized me"" or ""this movie's too scary"". Then people apply this logic to their kids, ""don't let them watch it, it's too scary for them"". While that's an ok approach for movies like SAW, I'm not so sure about movies that reflect reality. It may scare my kids, but I tell them to avoid strangers - and I tell them why. Don't try to bring your kids up in a Vacuum just telling them they can't do ""this and that"" and never explain why. Kids look at you with a puzzled look when you tell them to never talk to strangers, ""why? Mommy and Daddy do at the gas station""? I wagered a venture with my kids, for the sake of their own self-preservation. I told them exactly why you don't talk to strangers - I showed them the news articles of how people kill, rape, and torture children. Sure, my kids are a bit scared of strangers, but for good reason.

I think the movies were pretty dang good for their time. When my wife first asked if I watched to watch these on the web, I said - no thanks, it's a little to 70's-ish for me. But, I started catching a glimpse here and there of it and next thing you know, I'm watching it too. I've seen the left behind series too, and while they are ok movies, I think these were far better, as the message about God is more solid and clear.

The message these movies are attempting to get across is to be prepared. Like it or not, the current political climate is rapidly deteriorating, a one world government isn't a pipe dream like it used to be, it's close to obtainable now. RFID and Cellular technology make a mark not only feasible, but with terrorism getting out of control, along with identity theft and other `issues' a unique permanent ID for all citizens will soon become a `good way' to help fight crime and war. While it may seem like a good idea on the surface, deep down it's step one in attempting to dominate all of man. Who could argue that RFID/Cell transponders are a `bad' thing when they can be used to track down your dog, lost child, aged grandparent, or a criminal? The problem won't be so evident until the social/moral structure degrades a bit more - soon religion and other beliefs will cause too many issues for the controlling class of people in the world. Once religion is `illegal' that tag will enable them to track you down as well, since you are a `criminal'. With ""politically correct speech"" being the feel-good thing of the day (AKA doublespeak - read Orwell's 1984 for an amazing parallel to `political correctness'), soon they'll start twisting whatever they want into a crime.

So sure, go on with life and think `that'll never happen'. I'm sure the Romans thought Rome would be the power in the world forever too. After all, the Roman Empire existed for many more generations than western civilization has thus far, it most certainly wouldn't have been though of as one that would ever topple, but yet it did. Western Civilization lives in the same manner - we'll never be taken down - I mean come on, it's the year 2006 - things are different. Are they really? Only to the blind they are.

The most amazing fact of it all is that not one bit of it all it ""God's fault"". God sent Jesus to the world to prove this point. Jesus wasn't slaughtered by God - man killed Jesus. Not just Jews, but Romans too. The whole point being - it didn't matter who killed him specifically, it was man. And any man who sins is just as guilty as anyone else. *IF* man could live by two very simple rules: 1. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you *AND* 2. He, who is without sin, cast the first stone. - Man would be happy. Nothing man has done to date: prisons, wars, science, politics, `enlightenment' - has fixed ANY problem. Yet, those two above statements, if actually taken to heart; would fix all the worlds ills instantly. Funny how a man that lived 2000 years ago can make two simple statements, that - if followed, would fix all the worlds ills - yet man had been unable to even come close in the last 10,000 years. Heck, not even close - we haven't made any progress at all - wars, murder, rape - all still exist and never even decline in frequency they just keep getting worse. So where is all man's Wisdom and Understanding? So yet, even though we've made no progress, we continue down the same path - most will continue to look to the world for answers - yet, the world is the cause of all the problems, it does not possess the answers. Jesus did, he told us how to fix the world - through him and his teachings. No other writings are quite as wise as these. His social observation skills are and were still thousands of years ahead of us.

Life may traumatize you, it's best to stay strong and look for words of Wisdom - don't follow the lemmings. Read the bible yourself and really read it good, don't follow the lost - everyone always thinks they know the right path to follow, but those looking at God's roadmap for life are the only ones who'll reach the right destination. All religion is false - God made none of that. Read the book he made, it's the only truth out there. But most importantly, follow those rules yourself. The world will change only if each person makes change within themselves. If that doesn't happen, it simply will not work, ever. I guess God knew will that would be the case - thus, he took care to warn us about how far into the pit humanity would go. Just remember - if any of this does happen - just like Christ's' crucifixion - it's not God's fault at all, he warned us - it's ALL man's fault.",1154304000,7,5735,4.3460820895522385
1780411,1,B00006JDTN,"I was 5 or 6 when I was first introduced to this film and the rest of the series. They were screened at my church and everyone was encouraged to bring their families. Like some of the other reviewers here, I was absolutely terrified and proceeded to have nightmares and anxiety attacks for years. I developed a ridiculous fear of abandonment and would freak out every time I lost my mother in the supermarket or came home from school to an empty house (I actually would turn on the news to make sure I hadn't been ""left behind""). I also found myself up at the altar in tears every week just in case the previous week's salvation hadn't stuck.

I honestly believe my church screened the films with good intentions, and I know they have genuine concern for what they consider ""lost souls."" However, it is my opinion that scare tactics like these should NOT be used on kids. Children are incredibly impressionable and not capable of understanding the concepts at work in these films; I cannot think of anything less Christian than intentionally putting them through the sort of trauma so many of us here experienced. It's taken me 25+ years to stop being angry about this. That is insane.

i did research as challenged by the previous poster on the subject of the rapture, and i came up with this well backed statement from the link above.  not only does he give enlightened and documented proof that macdonald's ""trance"" did not develop the theory...as DOCUMENTED proof existed several decades before it at least, but he also backs it up with said details to proove it. such as the 1812 novel (18 years before her ""vision"") stating the rapture before the tribulation.

anyhow, your idea to only accept the word of God is profound, and wether or not one believes in the pre-rapture is inconsiquential to the christian faith.  what i believe comes from the word of God.  the only reason why the rapture would have any sway on His word is at my chances of being taken away (a escape from death) which would be nice...but it dosnt change His word, nor His truth.

it is unfortunate that the previous poster conformed to Judaism, however that individual's conversion is by NO MEANS in relation to something as trivial as ""does the rapture really exist"".  for anyone to stray from his or her faith it takes much more then that, either a lack of interest, or a doubt that existed from the beginning, or a over skeptical view on all things that demand faith.  sadly satan allows us all to be overly skeptical and places these tools in our way to cause us to stumble and fall. it is how we manage to pick ourselves up and see through these falsities before they manage to make us challenge our foundation of beliefs so much that satan's cults and off followings begin to look appealing (as does all sin).

just dwell on this fact. Wether or not the rapture is true or not(and i fervently believe it is...as there is DOCUMENTED proof that macdonald's trance did NOT start the rapture ""idea"" there is documented proof that it was preached centuries earlier then that)....why let it discourage you away from the faith? it dosnt change the christian faith if we are taken sooner or later.  why allow satan to shake the foundation of Christianity over something so inconsiquential to the true meaning?

i feel a great sadness to the previous poster on his conversion away from Christianity, however from what i read the skepticism in the post stems from swayed faith as a result of deception by all the false facts that exist out there as tools to cause us to sway from our true faith, not that of this video (which has boosted my faith greately every time i see it as it causes me to realize just how critical that i show more ATTENTION to my beliefs and PRIORITIZE my actions to what is TRUE, as well as to guide my life to influence my friends and others to come to God.......) If it has this effect on me, then how can anyone judge it for a ""cult video""?

it may not be suitable to small youth who are not of age and cannot handle the scary factor. it is a powerful video that shows what will happen, and makes you re-evaluate your priorities in life, but for small children it may be a bit too powerful untill they are teens and are able to grasp it better.

I also saw these movies as a child and for the next 20 years of my life, I had nightmares and anxiety attacks as well... I would wander downstairs in the night and check to make sure my parents were still there and had not been raptured (so you can imagine my consternation one time when I went down there and discovered the lights and TV on, but my parents were gone... they were just on the deck, but I didn't discover that until I started wailing and bawling)  I also had serious faith issues after watching these movies and spent many years scared of God, that every time I did something wrong, that was it, I was going to be left behind. Thank GOD that I finally realized one day that this interpretation is not Biblically sound, and treats the Bible like a jigsaw puzzle rather than books. You don't read a book like that! Do you read a sentence in the sports page, and then a sentence in the Nation section and put them together and try to make sense out of them???  No, and you'd call me silly for doing it! The only way this scenario of the ""rapture"" can take place is if you pull a whole bunch of OTHER Biblical passages, not found in Revelation, out of context and then fit them into this ""system"" of the ""end times."" But what if one of those pieces is out of place? Then the whole scenario will change. I just can't treat Biblical interpretation that way. You have to put it into its historical, geographical and cultural context, as well as the context of the passages it was originally found in! And Revelation is a timeless book that talks about the past, present and future. But no secret rapture that leaves some behind--all the things that happen in Revelation can easily be looked at as representative of all kinds of things that have happened throughout history (at least up through the REAL second coming). Besides... when have Christians ever been spared suffering? And why on earth would God remove his only witnesses when they were needed the most????  That makes NO SENSE.  Anyway...

2:51 'Give himself to Jesus'  FALSE GOSPEL.  If you have to give YOURSELF, then no CROSS is needed.  EVERY religion has that same claim, so no difference in Christianity, then.  Bible NOWHERE says you do this to be saved.

'millions of people will suddenly disappear' NOWHERE IN BIBLE.  If anything, 2 Witnesses come to DECLARE it happened (Rev11), so people won't necessarily find any disruption. So too the 144K JEWS who suddenly know about it (Rev7).  Again, no text saying Rapture itself is like millions disappearing.  No wonder, since so many who call themselves 'Christian' don't even get the gospel right, maybe they are NOT saved!

3:22 'Given your life to Christ'  FALSE GOSPEL, again saving no one.  NO WHERE in Bible is that said as what saves you.

11:00 et seq 'and that you'll come now and live in my heart' REALLY?  WHERE IS THAT IN THE BIBLE?  Yeech.
Then, a min later 'I feel it, I feel HIM!'  Yeah, right.  Sucker born every minute.  NOT SAVED by feeling.

Oh, and 'give your life to Christ' is supposed to be something Satan doesn't like (13:30 et seq)?  Oh yeah, he LOVES it, since you are NOT SAVED.  If you had to give your life to Christ, then what is the CROSS, chopped liver?  Sheesh.

I was in college when this movie newly came out, never heard of it. But even I, new Christian in the Jesus craze days, knew that the Gospel is BELIEVE HE PAID, not the garbage false gospels spewed in the movie (like give your life to Christ -- oh really? So why did HE GIVE HIS LIFE if you have to give yours? duh). There is no doctrinal accuracy in the movie. Pre-Trib Rapture is real, cuz Israel was promised 2100 years, and 7 were left to 'pay'. Long story why, but the Bible accounts it BY YEAR from Gen-Rev. NONE of that is in any of the Bible morives, and I've yet to see ONE which was even 50% accurate.

So no one can be saved by watching this, no real Gospel in it, no accounting for WHY the Rapture, or even what it is, nor does Bible say millions will disappear. This movie spits on Christ.",1513036800,,2164,4.323383084577115

But in a way, I think it's perfect the way it is.  The second movie in the series really covers well why we are sinners and need Jesus's blood to cleanse us from your sins.  I highly recommend this series to everyone, especially those who have not accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior, being good, going to church doesn't cut it.  Time is running out Jesus is coming soon!  If you miss the rapture, please accept Jesus right away because He will send a strong delusion to people who heard about salvation before, yet denied it and wouldn't accept the free gift of everlasting life through the belief in the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ.  Do not worship the beast or take the mark of the beast or you'll loose your soul to Satan, but if you don't repent before the end of the seven year tribulation period you will loose your soul anyway.  He knows our hearts too, you have to truly believe.  Jesus said, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life.  No one comes to the Father except  through me."" John 14:6. ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""

Someone commented something to the effect that, ""the rapture happens at the last trumpet not the first"".  For some reason people think that the Rapture happens at the time of the Trumpet Judgments, at the last one or in between the sixth and last trumpet judgements.  I guess because they are called 'trumpet' judgments.  The fact that they are called trumpet judgments has nothing to do with it.  There is no biblical proof it happens there.  In fact, why would it happen so late.  Christians are not appointed to God's wrath which not only includes the judgments of the first six trumpets but also the seven seals opened by the Lamb of God - Jesus.  Plus I hardly doubt Jesus would come to rapture His believers out during such a terrible time.  Significant events of our Lord always happens on the Feast Days of the Lord.  The next one to be fulfilled is The Feast of Trumpets which is a feast of blowing trumpets.  There are a series of 100 total, the last trumpet blast is long and drawn out, unlike the others.  He will come then, at a time we really don't know.  The Feast of Trumpets in 2017 is significant this year because on September 23, 2017 there will be a sign in the heavens, the sun, moon, stars and and planets that matches perfectly with Revelation 12:1-2.
