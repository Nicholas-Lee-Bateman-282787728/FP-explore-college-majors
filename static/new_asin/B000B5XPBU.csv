2400368,5,B000B5XPBU,"I watched this movie at my friend's house, and I didn't expect too much out of it at first because I had never heard about it.  I was totally surprised to find out how good this movie is.  I wish that I could've had the chance to see it in theaters.  I loved it.  Soon after watching the movie, I was shocked to found out that this movie was made with a limited budget.  The action scenes looks so professional.",1129680000,,411,4.0875
2400369,5,B000B5XPBU,"This movie is so good!  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Next to Arnold, I think Dolph Lundgren is probably the best action hero out there right now.  His character is so intense in this film.  I liked the way that his character has a painful past.  That makes him even more likeable.

Oh, and don't forget the hot chick in this movie.  She is smokin!  I'm glad that they managed to put a girl in this movie.  The fact that she knows her way with guns is a total turn on.",1129507200,2,485,3.917525773195876
2400370,5,B000B5XPBU,"Ok, the action scenes in this movie were so intense.  I can't believe they only had an 8 million dollar budget.  It looks so good.

I've been a big Dolph Lundgren fan for years now.  I'm glad that he's finally getting the chance to direct.  I think that he did a very smart thing by starting off his directorial debut with a movie with such a great plot.

I loved the fact that they got Jerry Springer to play the president.  I've always wanted to see him play a government official role.  If you ask me, he's better than the real thing.",1129507200,,537,4.196078431372549
2400371,5,B000B5XPBU,"I can't believe I didn't see this in theaters.  It's totally meant to be seen in the big screen.  The action is great, and the suspense scenes are fantastic.  I loved every minute of this film.  I remember Dolph from the Rocky movies, but I think this is his best movie yet.  I don't wanna give away too much, but the ending is soooo good.",1129507200,,339,4.153846153846154
2400372,5,B000B5XPBU,"This movie had a very good plot.  I was totally drawn into it.  Not only did they manage to incorporate a terrorist plot into it, but they also made sure that it had plenty of plot twists.  And that is sometimes difficult to do.  The director of The Defender did a very good job at making sure that every plot twist was shocking.

And it didn't hurt to make Jerry Springer the President either.  He fits perfectly into the role.  I knew that he would eventually play a government figure in a major film.  He pulls it off beautifully.",1129161600,,533,4.313131313131313
2400373,5,B000B5XPBU,I've been a huge fan of Dolph Lundgren's movies ever since I saw him in Rocky 4.  I'm glad that he was given the opportunity to direct a kick ass movie like The Defender.  I was on the edge of my seat during the entire movie.  I think Lundgren could be the next Arnold.  He's so intense in this movie.  I liked the fact that they got Jerry Springer to play the president too.  That was shear genius.,1129161600,,399,4.051282051282051
2400374,4,B000B5XPBU,"Jerry Springer is the president.  Drago from Rocky IV is the star and director.  I must say it sounded intriguing from the start, but it actually was a pretty good movie.  It reminded me of the old 80s action movies and I am a sucker for those, so I actually enjoyed this movie.  In my opinion, it is definitely worth checking out.",1129161600,2,331,4.290322580645161
2400375,5,B000B5XPBU,"A friend of mine had a copy of it.  I loved this movie.  It's so good.  This movie should have gone to theaters.  It would've made a load of money.  Besides the fact that it's a Dolph Lundgren movie, the plot is really really good.  I also liked the fact that Jerry Springer plays the president in this movie.  That's so perfect!  He totally pulls it off.",1129075200,2,355,4.1940298507462686
2400376,5,B000B5XPBU,"I'm so glad that he made another movie.  I love Dolph Lundgren.  The dude kicks ass!  This movie isn't bad, too.  For his first directorial piece, The Defender was pretty good.  This action movie actually had a plot.  Not many do.  I think it was really well written too.  I liked the way in which the story intertwined with what's going on today.  Not just that...the plot had a lot of twists.  It kept me on my toes.",1129075200,,418,4.243589743589744
2400387,4,B000B5XPBU,"again?...ok...BOOM!...if you want action with a side of twisted plot...then check out ""The Defender""...it's our buddy, Dolph Lundgren's directorial first and he does a damn good job. It had been awhile since seeing anything with this guy in it and ""The Defender"" totally satisfied the absence....

an added bonus?....Jerry Spriner plays our nation's president!...how nuts is that!?",1131321600,5,381,5.684210526315789
2400388,4,B000B5XPBU,"well that's not what the whole movie is about, but he was pretty good in it! No seriously though, this was a very entertaining movie and with Dolph Lundgren playing the lead/director...it was a very good move (no i didn't mean to say movIE!) So check it out and be prepared to be thrilled!",1131321600,2,289,4.37037037037037
2400389,5,B000B5XPBU,"the defender, how do you put this into words, lets see, awesome, original (for once), and keeps you on your toes. This movie is honesty put together very well despite it being a straight to dvd release. Anyways dolph is no traditional hero in any of his movies and works a little better as an anti-hero. Hilarious scene in the movie is when dolph lundgren shoots this guy in the torso, baddy falls down, and is struggling to move, then lundgren shoots him again, only this time in the dudes head. hahaha. Jerry Springer also did a pretty decent job considering his acting resume. Check it out, only 3 left on amazon at the moment.",1130803200,5,630,4.48695652173913
2400390,5,B000B5XPBU,"I always get a kick watching mr lundgren in all his action stunts throughout the many years of him on the silver screen doing what he does best....killing. So i popped this movie into the player as soon as i got it, and i smiled. Its been a while since i got a dvd menu that looked this good (for a lundgren movie that is) Anyways credits looked good, and the action let me tell you is f'in intense. First 30 minutes is a little slow but after it picks up believe it does not slow down. Overall very very good work, and hell Jerry Springer is the US president which alone should get some people to atleast have a look at the defender. Anyways get it if you live and die for action. Later",1130803200,4,687,4.0962962962962965
2400391,5,B000B5XPBU,"dude i love every dolph lundgren movie hes put out. maybe im biased watching this one but i could definately see why people say this one is totally different from the rest, i mean its the guys first directing job. Explosions, bullets, and babes, the essentials for any good action movie. The action is kind of shot like a saving private ryan move, especially when they are in the grave yard duking it out. Dolph you have done it again 5 stars.",1130803200,3,443,4.414634146341464
2400392,5,B000B5XPBU,"...and check this movie out immediately. I've been a long time lundgren fan but for some reason i was a bit skeptical of this movie. For one its lundgrens directorial debut and second (i laugh still) its starring the great jerry springer. Hmmmm, but i decided to order it anyways, and i must say i was impressed just watching the opening credits. It seemed like it had a hollywood blockbuster budget, but i can only credit lundgren for how he got the effects. Anyways the action is fast and catches you off guard most of the time. Best scene is when they are navagating the sewers beneath the hotel and are ambushed by some baddies. life long lundgren fans should definately not miss this one.",1130803200,2,693,4.552
2400393,5,B000B5XPBU,"okay so i picked up this movie at blockbuster, and to be honest it was due to curiosity. I had heard some buzz about it a little while back, but i had forgotten ever sicne. I was shocked to learn that this is Lundgrens directorial debut which made a big difference after the movie had stopped playing. My favorite scene in the movie is actually the first action scene when dolph demonstrates that guns aren't the only effective way for killing his enemies. Overall i would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an incredible adventure in both action and choreography. And + for a lundgren film the script isn't completely crap, maybe even good.",1130803200,2,656,4.663793103448276

2400395,5,B000B5XPBU,"I loved The Defender.  I thought it had a good plot and I thought that the acting was really intense.  Jerry Springer did an amazing job playing the president.  I think someone mentioned to me that he kinda looked like Bush.  I don't really see the relation between the both, but nonetheless, I thought he was very believable.  The plot had a based on true story feel to it.  It got me wondering if anything like this was really going on out there.  A good movie will do that.",1130371200,,476,4.280898876404494
2400396,5,B000B5XPBU,"If anyone out there is a Dolph Lundgren fan, you must see this movie.  It's one of my favorite Lundgren movies so far.  I totally loved it.  I'm glad that he decided to go back to hollywood and make movies again.  I kinda missed his work.  The action scenes are really well done.  And they're really intense too.  That part where he points the gun in the terrorist face is really good.  I was on the edge of my seat, wondering if he was gonna shoot him or not.",1130371200,,460,4.089887640449438
2400397,5,B000B5XPBU,"I love action movies and this one totally delivered.  The action scenes were off the hook.  Dolph Lundgren is pretty tight in it, too.  This role really suited him well.  I also thought that Jerry Springer looked good as the president of the USA.  If you think about it, he does look like Bush...sorta.  Anyway, besides the casting, the fight scenes were probably my favorite part.  That part where Dolph grabs the granade and throws it back was pretty tight.",1130371200,,459,4.6625
2400398,5,B000B5XPBU,"I liked The Defender.  I thought it was going to be dumb because i usually don't like action movies.  But this one caught my attention.  It was probably because the plot is really smart.  In the midst of all the action, this movie actually has a decent storyline.  I thought that was cool.",1130371200,,289,4.377358490566038
2400399,5,B000B5XPBU,"I love Dolph's movies.  I've watched all of his movies, but this is probably one of his best.  I think it's probably cause he had a lot more creative freedom with this project, being that he directed it.  He has such a strong presence on screen.  That scar on his face makes him look totally intimidating.  I wonder how he got that?  Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie.  Two thumbs up, way up!",1130112000,,393,4.301369863013699
2400400,5,B000B5XPBU,"I was really impressed by Dolph Lundgren in this movie.  This proves that he can definitely act.  Plus, he's a pretty likeable action star.  This is probably one of his best movies.  The action scenes were really well made if you ask me.  This is one of those movies where you just gotta brace yourself for, because it is hella violent.

On a side note: How awesome was it to get Jerry Springer to play the president!",1130112000,,417,4.35064935064935
2400401,5,B000B5XPBU,"This movie was pretty cool.  I wish I would've had the chance to see it in the movie theater.  I bet the action scenes would look dope on the big screen.  The thing that captivated me the most was the complexity of Dolph's character.  Unlike his other movies, he has a troubled and painful past in this movie, and I really simpathized with him in this one.  The beginning scene is so out of this world suspenseful.  I was cringing in my seat.  When they execute the 2 soldiers right next to him.  I think it was as graphic as the first scene of Kill Bill.",1130112000,2,555,4.169811320754717
2400402,5,B000B5XPBU,"I liked it.  The action scenes are really intense.  There's a lot of shooting in the movie, and plenty of good fight scenes.  All in all, this is probably the best action flick i've seen a while.  I also like the fact that Jerry Springer plays the president.

2400403,5,B000B5XPBU,"I think Lundgren is right up there with Arnold and Van Dam.  I think he's so underated, and I think that this movie proves my point.  I was really impressed by Dolph's acting in this movie.  He's got a really silent, serious appeal to him.

I also agree with some of the other reviews on here.  The plot in this movie is amazingly suspenseful.  I think it was really smart of Dolph to make a movie that mirrored our political struggle with the war on terror.  It made the movie much more believable.  It totally caught me by surprise.",1130112000,,534,4.3232323232323235
2400404,5,B000B5XPBU,"I liked it cause it was really suspenseful.  I was cringing in my seat during some of these scenes.  For instance, when they were guarding the premises of the hotel and everything was quiet.  I almost jumped out of my seat at the sound of the first gun fire.  I just knew that something was coming.  They did a really good job at building up the suspense in this movie.",1129680000,,369,4.214285714285714
2400405,5,B000B5XPBU,"I think that this was Dolph Lundgren's best movie so far.  I think it was due to the fact that since he was the director this time around, he was given more artistic freedom and more project control.  The action scenes were pretty awesome, too.  The shooting scenes were so suspenseful.  I must have seen at least 3 people get shot in the head.  The action was just non-stop.",1129680000,,375,4.3768115942028984
2400406,5,B000B5XPBU,"I've always been a huge fan of Dolph Lundgren.  I'm glad that his talent is finally being recognized.  As a director, I think he is phenomenal.  The story in The Defender is so captivating.  I was totally sucked it, from beginning to end.",1129680000,,238,4.465116279069767

8081657,3,B000B5XPBU,"Dolf Lundgren makes his directorial debut in The Defender (2004), an action/adventure film that delivers what you expect, plenty of gunfire, explosions, and combat in tight quarters.  The story is set in Romania, where National Security Advisor Roberta Jones (Caroline Lee-Johnson), on instructions from the President (Jerry Springer), is to attend a top secret meeting, with an unknown party, at an exclusive hotel.  Lance Rockford (Dolf Lundgren) is head of Jones' security team.  His lieutenant Kaye (Shakara Ledard), and the rest of the small security team is soon pressed into action, when they are attacked shortly after the meeting has begun.

The massive hotel makes for an interesting setting for conflict, as the Americans, and the visitor's security agents, combine to locate, and then defend the VIP's from hostile forces.  Fortunately the attackers are remarkably inept, as the handful of agents are able to hold off a force of superior numbers.  There's nothing new or special here, but a couple of plot twists add a some spice to the mix, though the conclusion to the fighting is an unrealistic mess.  The political conspiracy storyline is rather clich, winding up this pretty solid shoot 'em up which earns passing grades for Dolf Lundgren, both as an actor and director.  Except for a trailer, the widescreen release has no bonus features.",1252800000,,1356,5.159817351598173
8081658,3,B000B5XPBU,"I'm glad to see that ""The Defender"" has gotten such good reviews. After disasters like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agent-Red/dp/B00013RC4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agent Red</a>, fans of Dolph Lundgren definitely deserved a movie they could get excited about. Lundgren's first outing as director sees him avoiding all of the self-indulgent pitfalls that such an opportunity offers and proves beyond a doubt that he's as capable of putting together a coherent movie as he is kicking butt. However, even though this feat is made even more commendable through the restrictive nature of direct-to-video resources, it ends up short of what I consider to be a good action movie and is not what I consider to be the man's best self-directed feature (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Russian-Specialist/dp/B000CQ98FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Russian Specialist</a>).

The story: Lance Rockford (Lundgren) is a former POW and current government agent. On an assignment of national security, he and his team follow a member of the President's cabinet (Caroline Lee-Johnson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Gene/dp/B00151QY9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing Gene</a>) to a Romanian hotel for a with a mysterious robed man. During the meeting, the hotel is attacked by mercenaries of an unclear motive, and when both the masked man and Rockford's boss go missing during the firefight, Lance must find a way to get them all out alive and unravel the mystery.

Besides ""is it good?"", the biggest question when it comes to Dolph's recent movies is ""how much does it look like a DTV film?"" I'm happy to report that in this case, the movie has transcended the DTV stigmas of poor cinematography, lackluster effects, and lousy editing to an admirable level. While budget constraints are visible, the production crew made a fine effort to bring the film several steps closer to Hollywood-level than expected. Of course, credit goes to the actors, too: Lundgren is a bit more than decent in his portrayal, but the real praise goes to Lee-Johnson, Shakara Ledard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Clip/dp/B0002DB5KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Clip</a>), Thomas Lockyer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dog-Soldiers/dp/B000RW5BZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dog Soldiers</a>), and a handful of other players who throw together a cumulative performance more endearing than I had expected, especially in conveying the sense of brotherhood among Lance's team.

The aforementioned aspects of the film are so surprisingly decent that I almost don't want to mention the movie's faults...but rest assured, they're there. While I generally approve of the storyline for its relative complexity and socio-political leaning, I can easily see it being disliked and even angering some less lenient viewers. Without spoiling anything, the plot draws strong parallels to the Iraq War and includes an extreme outlook of how the government regards its international enemies. It doesn't bother me, but Americans more gung-ho than myself might find themselves turned off by the conspiracy theory. In addition, the movie's action content isn't all that great. Shootouts make up roughly 95% of the adrenaline, and while these are well done for the most part, they're nothing extraordinary and keep Dolph from performing all but the barest of hand-to-hand scenes.

Personally, I'd be more interested in seeing director Dolph tackle an outright thriller instead of an action movie. I have no doubt that if ""Defender"" had been handled as such, it would've seemed a bit more one-sided in its positive aspects. Plainly, this is a good DTV movie, but not a great one. Definitely something out-of-the-ordinary for the Swedish Superman, but maybe not exactly what he needed.",1230768000,,3974,6.129263913824057
8081659,4,B000B5XPBU,"Action icon Dolph Lundgren stars as Lance Rockford, a secret service agent covering a top-secret diplomatic assignment in Romania with high stakes for the war on terror.  But soon the shadows of conspiracy close in, and Rockford finds himself fighting not only for the mission, but for the fate of America itself.

Lundgren is more than the star of THE DEFENDER--he's the director as well, and generally does a good job on both sides of the camera.  Lundgren can play the heroic gunman in his sleep, and the numerous action scenes are played out with suspense and a satisfying aesthetic.  The shoot-outs are deadly but not over the top, which adds a touch of realism to the sober scenario.  Twists and turns abound in the plot, and the script could perhaps have been a little streamlined, but at least some thought went into the story.  Acting is pretty good, and while Jerry Springer isn't everyone's cup of tea as the President, he does an adequate job of playing the beleagured Chief Executive...and anyway, Springer is the kind of person who frequently does get elected to public office, whatever that says about Americans as voters (let's not forget he is a former politician in real life).

THE DEFENDER is a very good little action film that frequently aspires to rise above its genre limitations and often succeeds.  The script is ambitious and Lundgren delivers the pyrotechnics his fans expect.",1230076800,,1404,4.869747899159663
8081660,3,B000B5XPBU,"""The Defender"" is an interesting film because of the questions it raises about people who place values of patriotism so high that they are willing to violate the principles of democracy they seek to defend.  This fundamental philosophic blunder that the end justifies the means is well illustrated in Douglas W. Miller's screenplay with Dolph Lundgren's direction.  Jerry Springer plays the president who uncovers a top-level plot to overthrow the president.  Along with Mrs. Jones -- who I wasn't sure whether she played the National Security Advisor or the Secretary of State -- set up a clandestine meeting with a figure so heinous that it'd be like George Bush setting up a meeting with Osama bin Laden.  Mrs. Jones is played by Caroline Lee Johnson, who does a good job as the brainy and loyal presidential advisor.  Since this is extremely top secret, only a few are privy to the meeting taking place; and it is stressed to Lundgren's security force that no one must know.  Unfortunately, Newell played by Ian Potter from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jacket/dp/B0009G3B0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jacket</a>&nbsp;& ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the patriotic traitor who believes the president is too soft on terrorists and must be removed.  When Lundren & Mrs. Jones show up for the secret meeting at a castle outside of Bucharest, Romania, they are met by a team of United States secret ops who are there to kill Jamal (the Osama character) and Mrs. Jones, making public the president's blunder.  So the irony is that you've got U.S. secret ops sent out to kill the Secretary of State (my best guess) being fought by Dolph Lundgren's secret service ops.  The reversal comes when we learn that the entire meeting has been a setup to flush out the traitorous high level generals, senator and national security people.  Shakara Ledard who was in ""Raising Helen"" plays Kaye, one of Lundgren's security team that proves to be a mole for the other side.  The climactic scene with Lundgren flipping a blade up a staircase and into her chest brings the bloodshed to a head.  Dolph Lundgren who I first saw in ""Rocky IV"" and liked in a 1992 film called ""Universal Soldier"" does a good but fairly stone-faced job of commanding his team.  Some will find the idea of the United States attacking the United States in the country of Romania a bit far-fetched.  Even stranger is that we're asked to root for the Romanian police force who shows up and machine guns down the bad Americans.  The production values and the rote editing place this in the ""B"" picture category, but it is an interesting flick for action fans as well as those intrigued by the inner workings of Washington D.C.

8081661,5,B000B5XPBU,"I have always had a weakness for action films, and though I usually avoid ones that promise to have a lot of suspense simply because I am actually easily scared I found that this movie is fantastic despite the few areas that are full of suspence are deftly handled and add to the plot of the story rather than being just there to scare you.  the plot is well thought out and executed...I must say I was surprised at the ending!  although in hindsight I should have seen it coming.  Anyway, I love the way it was directed, the lighting was perfect in every shot...well thought out, you know, sometimes in movies something is supposed to happen at night but it seems really bright outside?  well, that doesn't happen in this movie.  death scenes are believable, blood strategic rather than over the top...not that there isn't a lot of it...and really, really well acted.  There weren't very many awkward parts, where you didn't believe that the charecters really were who they thought that they were.  And though I normally find that political stories are a bit dry, or totally paranoid I found this one to be really engaging and not the least bit boring.  On the whole it you like action films, and slightly surprising plot twists, I suggest this movie wholeheartedly.",1173398400,8,1267,4.675675675675675
8081662,1,B000B5XPBU,"Easily the most wasteful use of cinema in ages. The fact that many reviewers here actually gave this movie more than one star is a frightening comentary on society. Are these the people who will one day be running our great country? How low will we go? This movie pretends to be something big but the big question is what happens? Nothing! Nothing but endless shots of Dolph and other people walking around properties doing nothing. 8 million rounds of ammo fired at nothing just to make noise. And what's with this guy who after every round must point his gun at the ceiling? If you are firing at a bad guy, the last thing you do is take your aim off of the suspected area of danger. Geeezz! How dumb can you get? There are endless scenes of people looking off into space saying nothing. Here is a scene. Shot of some guy with a gun saying and doing nothing for two seconds, then two seconds of Dolph doing nothing, then two seconds of some gal, two more of Dolph, two more of some guy, two more of the girl, two more of Dolph all without a single world!! What a moronic, pointless movie! When someting is said, the dialog has no substance at all. Walk out of the room, fix a sandwich, water the cat, have a quickie, come back and you haven't missed a single important plot point BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLOT! I want those 90 minutes of my life back that I wasted on this joke! I can't imagine the other people here giving any kind of review to this movie that is above the level of litterbox. Don't waste a moment of precious life watching this pointless flop. The rest of you guys giving this movie more than one star, PLEASE, in the name of all that is holy, try watching something of substance (Jerry Springer's idiotic show would be an improvement) and please cut down on the video games,  Dilly Bars and popcorn with extra butter.",1153440000,5,1833,4.34402332361516
8081663,3,B000B5XPBU,"This film contains the action scenes we expect from such a vehicle, but the writers for some reason decided to tie these scenes to a plot so complex, and (for me) unlikely, that it comes to resemble a comedy of some kind. Layer upon layer of double-crossing and false identities are revealed between burts of automatic gunfire until the viewer, who has settled into his easy chair with his bag of popcorn, expecting to enjoy a typical Lundgren bloodbath, is badly confused and shaking his head. They tried to do far too much.

I think the complex plot also causes several large plotholes. For instance, just who are these innumerable masked attackers, and how did so many appear in Romania? And how could this massive gun battle rage for hours outside Bucharest without somebody (e.g., the police) noticing it? (The Romanian Army doesn't show up for ages).",1132531200,7,856,4.8231292517006805

8081665,5,B000B5XPBU,"So how many movies has Dolph Lundgren been in? Quite a few, right? Well, I have to say, this has been one of his best works so far. Maybe it's because he also had the whole directing thing going on, I don't know. What I do know is that he did a great job with the movie in both aspects (directing and acting).

Solid movie that won't dissapoint.",1131321600,7,345,4.073529411764706
