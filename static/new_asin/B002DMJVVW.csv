8600913,5,B002DMJVVW,"This was well produced,  multiple cameras, the dealers know their stuff in explaining the game although they seemed ill at ease in front of the camera no mistakes that I noticed. This Mr. X guy goes through and goes over the stuff you need to know. money management discipline etc. I was surprised there were no basic strategy aids although he explained it. He includes a web site  address which shows you how to make a card for your location. Vegas and Atlantic City are different. He includes a really easy two card following procedure. I won $110 the first time I used it ($10 game).
If the DVD has a weak point it's in the side bet games multiple action, spanish blackjack, double exposure, etc. He doesn't go into a great deal of detail basically saying they are house games(which they are) Well I paid for the DVD the first time I played with the system he showed. I don't win every time but I think I am better off for getting it. This DVD isn't going to let me retire
you know they don't build these palaces off winners but at least I am winning more often",1248825600,,1064,4.341708542713568
