8158793,4,B000KRIGWC,"While this film doesn't rank next to bigger budget, star-laden films about Israeli history, i.e. Operation Thunderbolt and Raid on Entebbe, is does have Robert Fuller (Laramie, Wagon Train, Return of the Seven, Emergency) doing an excellent job portraying an Israeli army captain assigned to lead a squad to destroy an Egyptian radar station.  Special effects were not great, but that is to be expected of an Israeli film from the 1960's.",1375401600,,438,5.083333333333333
