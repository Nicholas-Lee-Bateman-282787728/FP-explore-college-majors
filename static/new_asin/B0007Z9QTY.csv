8323978,3,B0007Z9QTY,"This film takes the viewer on a slow yet dramatic sequence of events that portrays the desperation and challenging obstacles that face the youth in Iran today.

Etti, the young girl who talks of living abroad, is approached by a man (Reza Golzar) that desires to help her. There is an obvious chemistry between these two, one that is platonic in nature.

Etti's behavior throughout this film appears innocent at first but one will notice that she has a different agenda in mind, one of desperate hope, a better future as a result of dissatisfaction with daily life in Iran... which seems to be an understatement among the youth in Iran for many years.

Reza feels obligated to assist Etti yet stumbles upon other obstacles between his own job and family life. Reza's character is laid back and introverted to some degree but remains a man that is skeptical of Etti towards the end of the film.

Many Iranian films that are produced in Iran leaves the viewer with a void at the end. Its up to the viewer to fill the gaps and understand the social dynamics between the character's and the consequences of their actions.

The end of this film ""Boutique"" is a mystery, regarding the fate of Etti. To the casual viewer, with no knowledge of Iranian cinema, this film provides a glimpse into the dark and often sad ending of Iranian cinema.",1164844800,6,1334,4.635593220338983
