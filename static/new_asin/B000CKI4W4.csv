8099161,5,B000CKI4W4,"Alfred Hitchcock's THE PARADINE CASE is an interesting film from this director. On the surface it appears to be about a courtroom murder case where the accused Misses Paradine (Alida Valli) is defended by barrister (Gregory Peck) who becomes infatuated by here statuesque beauty and in doing so undermines his marriage to Ann Todd. Valli is accused of murdering her husband who we never see in person but only in a portrait. We never actually see the murder on screen. We must rely on the testimony of the witnesses to come to some conclusion about Mister Paradine's demise. Louis Jourdan is the late Mister Paradine's manservant. His relationship to both Mister and Misses Paradine leaves many questions for the viewer. Jourdan who delivers one of his best performances expertly plays this pivotal character. The film is really about relationships ending and evolving and to a degree about relationships that are imagined. Relationships end or are put on hold. Relationships reveal sharp realities for the central characters and they must come to terms with their own conduct. Other relationships such as Charels Laughton and his wife Ethel Barrymore have remained static and listless. They each fulfill what is left of a relationship that should never have been. The submissive Barrymore dutifully endures the bullying nature of Laughton, the presiding judge. Being a David O. Selznick's picture the production is lavish yet somehow it is overshadowed by the bleak nature of the screenplay. The production values are almost a counterpoint to the story and to actress Valli's rather sullen performance, which remains a bit of an enigma. Gregory Peck's performance is very good. Because of his basic good nature the viewer feels for his flawed character and his realization of this that will no doubt come by the end of the film. Louis Jourdan flat out gives a memorable and impressive performance showing off his mastery of histrionics. This film deserves long overdue attention.",1381104000,,1980,5.1521739130434785
8099162,4,B000CKI4W4,the movie ultimately disappoints---but only plot-wise-it turns out--despite pecks believing otherwise !! she killed him---no surprises there- but its interesting watching charles coburn charles laughton and gregory peck do their thing-- three truly great actors in their prime-- and of course a glimpse of hitch himself in there as usual- for a brief second getting off a train---but the almost incredible Peck's falling in love w his client---annoying his wife----- is a ripe area of juicy husband /wife stuff--hitch taking his usual delight in showing the ugly side of intimacy-sticking pins in the conventions of society- so its not the movie as a whole that wins us over but the precious moments here and there that ring true-- a chilling moment that makes the whole thing more than worth watching-- is an interesting and arresting scene w laughton and pecks wife-- where laughton-- the judge-- takes pecks wifes hand-- almost against her will--on a couch at a cocktail party-- and puts her entrapped hand on his knee --squeezing her hand---- to her disgust and ours--- its a massive & chilling moment ! and the court room scenes are wonderful-- and show the big differences between our courts and theirs-- judges over there can question witnesses further--comment etc--- here it would be leading the witness or influencing the jury etc---but i think it makes for better getting at the truth actually---which this movie does quite well--- altho i think a better ending would have been her blind husband having poisoned himself-- but w his cheating wife and her lover each thinking the other did it etc--- but IF U WANT TO SEE CHARLES LAUGHTON AT HIS COURTROoM BEST-- CHeCK OUT WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION of course-- a real masterpiece w a killer surprise ending!!! but this movie is definitely worth viewing -- just to see the great insights it offers into human nature and the scenes between hitch's portly alter egos--- here-- the two great charles' of their day -laughton and coburn-- wonderful ! & the print is mint looking !,1186790400,5,2034,4.985294117647059
