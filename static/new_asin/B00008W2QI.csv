1863667,5,B00008W2QI,this was so funny. jamie foxx totally took over the show. when another roaster tried to take a shot at him jamie just totally got into him i could hardly contian myself i felt jamie just owned the whole show. most everyone was also funny but jamie made the roast for me. i would definately recommend this dvd,1077926400,2,308,4.327586206896552
1863668,5,B00008W2QI,"I highly recommend this DVD.  Most of the jokes are not about Emmitt, but about the entire panel of roasters.  Shaq get's roasted pretty bad.  Features Mo'nique, Guy Torry, Joe Torry, Jeff Ross, Michael Colyar, Jimmy Johnston, Michael Irvin, Dick Gregory, Stuart Scott, and Daryl Johnston!  However, Jeff Ross steals the show and is so funny, I almost choked on my food.",1070496000,4,370,4.919354838709677
7987400,5,B00008W2QI,This is definitely one of the best comedy roasts I've watched. A kudos to Jamie Foxx for putting this together.,1465862400,,111,4.6
7987401,5,B00008W2QI,Came on time would deal again thank you,1434240000,,39,4.0
7987402,5,B00008W2QI,"This item met my expectations perfectly well,  the customer service was great.  Look forward for more of my business in the future.  In-fact,  I would like to order Hidden Colors I and II.",1429488000,,188,4.606060606060606
7987403,5,B00008W2QI,Hilarious. Jeff Ross kills it in this one and it may be his best roast performance ever. It was awesome seeing Michael Colyar too.,1426550400,,130,4.458333333333333
7987404,4,B00008W2QI,I wanted to laugh a little more.  My husband enjoyed it and would have given it five stars.  Some of the jokes seemed a little over the top but then again it is a roast.,1339632000,,169,3.8
7987405,3,B00008W2QI,this was one of the worst of the roast franchise. I cannot readily think of any roast that was worse than this one. other than when jamie foxx started getting on another no name comedians case it wasn't too funny.,1338508800,,213,4.35
7987406,5,B00008W2QI,Doug Williams' failed attempt at roasting Shaq & Jamie Foxx going in on him makes this DVD worth adding to your collection. Hilarious!,1256342400,,134,4.869565217391305
7987407,4,B00008W2QI,"The roasting was pretty weak, but Jaime had my side hurting when an unknown comedian attempted to roast Emmit. I would have given it 5 stars but I just got tired of everyone talking about Shaq's member. I thought it was a roast of Emmit Smith. Not enough roasting to much congratulating.",1197590400,,287,4.538461538461538
7987408,3,B00008W2QI,"This roast was one of the funniest i have seen. Jeff Ross(a fixture of comedy roasts) TOTALLY stole the show. They need to make a DVD with all of his comedy roasts. Unfortunately, they decided to let non comedians or people who knew NOTHING about Emmitt roast him. In particular, Daryl Johnston and mo'nique were painful to sit through.

Another thing was Jamie Foxx, while funny himself, totally stepped on Dick Gregory and Doug Williams, while they were trying to get through their sets. Hopefully in future roasts they use one microphone, or at least cut the clip-on mics off.",1125705600,3,579,4.79
7987409,5,B00008W2QI,Emmitt Smith&shaq both got roasted really well here.this is un-cut&nothing is off limits which I like.the first Shaq roast was funny big time&this one is just as funny.foks bring there  game at coming at peeps on here.,1086998400,2,218,4.891891891891892
