7995475,4,B0000A1HOO,I liked this series much better than Cardcaptors.  It made a lot more sense and all of the sub-plots were there.,1197504000,,112,4.333333333333333
7995476,1,B0000A1HOO,"this applies to the whole cardcaptor series. the story is really good and the animation is great, but it is just completely boring to watch. the fight scenes are very boring and unimaginative.  this is all my opinion, of course... if u want action, don't look here, but if u want slow moving plotline and character development, check it out ;)",1113523200,,343,4.622950819672131
7995477,5,B0000A1HOO,"I've enjoyed the third season of Cardcaptor Sakura the most.  Whereas the first two seasons can be bogged down with the formulaic capture of the cards, I find the third seasons plays out better because relationships intesnify and the emotional impact is so much greater!  This volume definitely heightens the drama as feelings are revealed all the while the threat of Eriol continues to intesnsify.  Sakura's magic is growing ever stronger as time passes; she also comes closer to discovering Eriol's machinations!  Definitely building to the climax of the series in this volume.  This is a great series.  I highly recommend it!",1074038400,10,628,5.107843137254902
7995478,5,B0000A1HOO,"As the titles says, so few review.  But anyway this disc is definitely intense.  Everything is coming to a great conclusion as the emotional steamroller hits everyone in this volume, especially poor sakura and shaoran.  So watch it!  The story is great, emotions, high, what more can you ask for from CCS!",1064361600,,305,4.8076923076923075
