1455209,5,B00005JLD4,"The shameful story at the core of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" is not a new one and can be traced back many thousands of years: the pilgrims and subsequent settlers of what was to become the USA decimating the Native Americans of Northern America and the Spanish Conquistadors who conquered and decimated the Aztecs and other Indian Nations of Mexico and South America all in the name of bringing an unwanted civilizing effect on these ""natives.""
The English settled Australia primarily as a penal colony but when towns began to be form, they felt it necessary to bring about the ""civilizing"" of the Aborigines peoples of Australia as they attempted to stamp out the native language and religion.
The specific story of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" is true and involves the extremely sad yet life affirming journey of Molly and Daisy (Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury), two half caste girls, who are placed in a school to basically teach them how not to be Aborigine girls and to work in British factories and thereby be accepted by proper British society. The fences of the title are those that ran almost the full length of Australia in an attempt to stamp out a problem involved with the over population of rabbits that plagued Australia in the 1930's.
There is a particularly horrendous scene involving Mr. Neville (Kenneth Branagh), whom the Aborigines call ""Mr. Devil,"" who talks to a group of women about how the Australian Government hopes to rid Australia of Aborigines through the use of inter-breeding with Caucasians:
""All it takes is three generations to accomplish,"" he says with a self-satisfied smile on his face. Disgusting.
Molly and Daisy and at first Gracie (who is captured) have very strong ties to their mothers who seem to be guiding them home...some 1800 miles away from the school.  Daisy and Molly are guided by more than a knowledge of the land and of tracking in particular but by the mystical nature of love: there is a magical scene in which Molly's Mother has her hand on the fence 1800 miles away from Molly who also has her hand on the fence and you can tell that they can ""feel"" each other.
Much of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" reminds me Peter Weir's ""The Last Wave"" another film with the strong reverberations of another world, another level of reality. In fact, David Gulpilil so persuasive and effective in ""The Last Wave,"" plays a tracker hired by the authorities to find the runaways.
""Rabbit Proof Fence"" is a simple story, told extremely well. If it changes the thinking of merely one person so inclined...it will have served its purpose.",1040947200,4,2557,4.798185941043084
1455210,5,B00005JLD4,"Between 1905 and 1971, the Australian government had a horrible policy.  They forcibly removed all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools.  The grown daughter of one of these children wrote a book about her mother's experiences.  This film is an adaptation of that book.
The story takes place in 1931, when Molly, then 14, her sister Daily, then 8, and her cousin Gracie, then 10, are literally torn from the arms of their mothers, put in a cage, and taken 1,200 miles away to a school which is actually a sort of prison.  Here, they are forbidden to speak their own language, they have to attend a Christian church, and are taught the ways of the white Australian culture around them.  Led by Molly, the girls run away.  And most of the film is the odyssey of their trek back home, following the rabbit-proof fence that bisects Australia, constructed to keep rabbits out of the pastureland.
The villain is clearly the white director of the school. It is amazing, but he actually believes in the racial theories that were prevalent at the time. He believes he is helping them and plays his role well, coming across as stupid and misguided rather than evil.  The Aboriginal girls are all unknowns, and terrific actresses, as are the women who play Molly and Daisy's mother and grandmother. The courage and determination of the girls during their three-month journey, the people they meet along the way, and their efforts to dodge the trackers who have been sent to retrieve them by the school, is truly inspiring.  This is all set against the backdrop of the Australian outback; the cinematography certainly captures its beauty.
The film is 94 minutes long and moves quickly.  I immediately identified with the girls and felt their fear as well as their bravery as they made their way across the Australian continent.  In a postscript to the story, we learn more about their lives.  It did not turn out to be pretty.  But two of the girls have survived into their nineties, and we meet them briefly.  They are strong women with weathered faces, one of them walking with a cane, but clearly at home in their Outback surroundings.
The film is a lesson in inspiration and courage as well as a geography and history lesson about Australia.  I loved it and highly recommend it.",1039219200,221,2291,4.752525252525253
1455211,4,B00005JLD4,"'Rabbit-proof Fence' tells the story of three Aborigine girls who were taken from their home and were transferred to a special school, where they could learn the manners of white people. That was part of a bigger Australian Government plan to 'assimilate' half-caste children into the white community, a plan monitored and executed by the Chief ""Protector"" of Aborigines. Soon the three girls would commence on a long journey back to their home.
This is a story that given to the wrong hands, could easily have turned into a Hollywood melodrama. Still, Phillip Noyce, mostly known for his action flicks, like 'Patriot Games' or 'The Bone Collector', keeps his direction simple and true. He cares for his characters and uses his visual skills in the right direction.
He has the help of a nicely assembled cast, that in its majority consists of amateur actors. The three girls, playing the lead parts, and especially Everlyn Sampi as Molly, are impressive. The only big star of the movie is Kenneth Branagh. He succeeds in making us believe that the Chief ""Protector"" of Aborigines truly believes in his task. He feels responsible for those kids, and genuinely thinks that driving them away from their homes is for their own good. David Gulpilill as the aboriginal tracker sent to find the girls, does not have to utter many phrases, but gives a solid performance, mostly based on his facial expressions.
The cinematography is gripping, thanks to the breathtaking Australian landscape. The music, written by Peter Gabriel, is right to the point. Still at a few points I would prefer it, if the volume was just a notch lower.
My only objection to the movie is its duration. I know and feel that the girls were like birds in a cage, while at the boarding school. Still, I was not totally convinced, by the scenes of their stay there, that they would decide to escape so abruptly. I know and feel that the road back to their home is a tough one, full of obstacles and challenges. Still, I sensed that something was missing in the way that it was depicted, something that would probably enhance the drama, and absorb the viewer to a greater extend.
Concluding, 'Rabbit-proof fence' is a movie that you should see. It tells beautifully a heartbreaking story, while never going over the top with sentimentality. In any case, don't forget to bring your hankies with. They might be useful.",1037836800,9,2379,4.819070904645477
1455212,5,B00005JLD4,"I have already done a review for this on the IMDB so i won't give you a word for word repeat here. I will say that i think this stunningly beautiful movie may be the greatest we have ever made in this country. Trust me if you love wonderful cinematography great acting and an incredible story that will touch your heart you just have to see this movie. I am so kicking myself that i never saw it in the theartre. At the moment it is out as a rental only dvd here in ozz but it is a glorious 2 disc set with fantastic comm from philip noyce and great behind the scenes doco. Luckily i managed to score an ex rental this week and it is one of the jewels in my collection. You guys can buy it from ezydvd in early december but i would recomend you catch on the big screen first. It was interesting to find out that philip noyce dropped out of the sum of all fears to come home and make this movie,man did he make a great choice there!",1033776000,6,931,3.983957219251337
1455213,4,B00005JLD4,"Absorbing look at the true story of three aboriginal half-casts who attempted a daring 1500 mile journey across the dangerous desert country of Australia to get home. Gripping all the way with beautiful location photography and great performances from an inexperienced cast. But the cinematography is a noticeable cheat and the children's survival could have been more thorough and better depicted.
Still, the end result is a winning. Notable nods to Keneath Brannagh as the Aboriginal Rights Minister and David Gulpilil is particularly sturdy as the master tracker. One of Noyce's most ambitious films yet.",1033603200,3,607,5.4
1455214,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is a wonderful film which the world's largest audience, America, has yet to see. Directed by Phillip Noyce of Bone Collector fame, it follows two sisters; Molly and Daisy and their cousin Gracie. Born half-caste children in the 1930's (white fathers with Aboriginal mothers), their fathers have had a quick bit of fun while building a rabbit-proof fence then long since moved on. The fence stretches from one side of Australia to the other. As a law, half-caste children come under rule of a man named Mr A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh). He orders the three young girls to be taken from their mothers and placed in a 'concentration camp' like place over 1500 miles from home. Any girl who tries to escape will be tracked down by a man named Moodoo who will have her punished. The three girls manage to escape into the vast untouched land on a trek back home, covering their tracks on the way. Always one step ahead of Moodoo, they come across the occasional people on their farms. Not knowing who to trust they must take risks. The girls realise that the only way to get back home is to follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence.
I was lucky enough to go to one of the New Zealand Premieres. After recognising the talanted Christine Olsen (Screenwriter/Producer) from the television and newspapers I decided to approach her. What a wonderful woman she was. We talked about all different things for about 15 - 20 minutes and would have continued if only she didn't have to introduce the film. She grabbed the only Press Kit they had there and personally signed it to me which was a real delight. The movie turned out to be brilliant. The screenplay was amazing and the silence said about as much as the words. The young barely trained actresses playing the girls did a magnificent job. Well directed and a must-see for anyone and everyone. It will make you laugh and make you cry but the thing to remember is that it is based on a truely terrible story of Australia's history. >Enjoy<",1031443200,5,1989,4.653409090909091
1455215,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is a true and real life biography of a girl being snapped away from her mother because she is a half-caste - offspring of a white man and an aboriginal woman. The movie has a very detail description of the intention of the Whilte Australians in the 30s to whiten all these children by removing them from their mothers, sending them to the training camps. The story depicted 3 girls running away from the camp and walked 1200 miles back home to reunite with their mother. The movie is very natural and touching that you will just be drawn inside the hearts of those girls, who has nothing but strong determination to go home and live a life they want. The movie also described the arrogance of the Whitle Australians until the 1970s, who tried every effort to justify their whitening process of this Stolen Generation. It is a very honest portray of the experience of Molly, who was unfortunately being forced into this generation and lived a wandering and heart breaking life due to this policy. It should be watched by all people so that we could learn to respect other people's life and culture as they are, instead of superimposing what we think is the best for them, for they might end up to be a curse of life for these people. This is a very touching and introspecting production that should not be missed. It does not attempt to achieve a melodramatic effect, but a simple honest reminder for respecting the aboriginals who are actually the native people who live on this island continent. Things haven't been really improved in Australian over the aboriginal issues, but this is a very good attempt to raise the conscious of people over the land that the White Australians conquered 200 years ago, and how much the mentality of some of these people have and have not changed. The cinematography is also spectacular. In all, this is not a movie to be missed.",1031011200,7,1884,4.6437125748503
1455216,5,B00005JLD4,"I was fortunate to see this movie while visiting Sydney, Australia in February. Having heard about the stolen generation, I was ignorant of the policies established concerning the legal abduction of Aboriginal children from their families until I saw this film based on a true story.
I was expecting a documentary-like, low-budget film. Instead, I found myself captivated on so many levels by a film that was not only well written, but well produced, directed, and acted. I was shocked to find out that this practice was legal until 1970. More importantly, I was amazed and inspired by the determination of Molly, Daisy, and Gracie as they journeyed 1,600 km to return home.
I am presently reading ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" written by Molly's daughter Doris Pilkington (Nugi Garimara). I can't wait to see the movie again!",1019520000,11,817,5.059259259259259
1455217,5,B00005JLD4,"This is a true story set in 1931 Western Australia, where white people stole half-aboriginal children away from their families and placed them into orphanages, hoping to force them into white society. Three young girls escape the orphanage and follow the rabbit-proof fence across the country, knowing that home is somewhere along it. The whole time they are being tracked.
This is an incredibly touching story that I think everyone needs to see. It is such a shame that this movie will not get the recognition it deserves outside of Australia, especially since America does not have a dissimilar past regarding Native Americans.
The three main characters in the film were girls from aboriginal tribes who had no previous acting experience, and they did a better job than most popular adult actors. I can not praise this film enough; I loved it so much, and knowing that it actually happened had an incredible impact on me. I don't think I'll come across a better film for a long time.",1019088000,17,985,4.834319526627219

1455327,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit Proof Fence tells us a story based on true events of three girls who are taken away from their families by force to become slaves as working for the Australian Government at a camp site. During their time as slaves they make a risky escape and face a long journey of over 1,500 miles to get back home where they came from. During their long journey they are faced with dangers and are being chased by a man sent to capture them. Eventually the girls split up and two  of them succeed in making it back home with their mother. This movie can really share similarities with cultures around the world as many cultures have had a history of forced labor just like these girls did in the story. This is also a story of survival, hope, and the relationship between the girls and their motive to survive together. This story shows that sometimes sacrifices must be made and that the instinct to survive can be one of the most powerful motives. Overall I would say this movie was very well done, it is an adventure filled with suspense and emotion. It also puts you in a situation when you are thinking the whole time of how amazing it is that three little girls can be so strong through a journey like this.",1510444800,,1207,4.388392857142857
1455398,4,B00005JLD4,"In 1869, the Aboriginal Protection Act was passed in Australia. This act gave the government the authority over the Aboriginal people of that continent. In an Aboriginal area named Jigalo, three young Aboriginal girls were literally snatched from their mothers arms and taken to a settlement called Moore River Native Settlement. These 3 girls, Molly, Daisy, and Gracie, were half-castes. Half-caste was term used to describe children who were born from one Aboriginal parent and a white person. The Aboriginal Protection Act was put into action to capture half-caste children and train them to become servants. At the settlement, the children were not allowed to speak their original language or practice their indigenous religion. They were also beaten if they tried to escape.

Rabbit Proof Fence tells of the extraordinarily true story of 3 girls who escaped the settlement and walked 1200 miles back home. These 3 girls followed a rabbit proof fence that stretched from one part of Australia to the other. Remembering that the fence went right through Jigalo, they followed it. It was no easy trek however. Being tracked by an Aboriginal man named Moodoo who worked for Moore River and some of the local authorities, these girls went on a 9 week journey to find home.

Practicing parts of the indigenous religion and traditions that were taught to her by her mother and grandmother, the oldest of the girls received signs from her spirit bird. The spirit bird was an actual hawk of some sort that she had a spiritual connection with. As with most indigenous religions, humans have a special correlation with nature. While being separated from the children, the mother and grandmother practiced certain rituals and chants, indigenous to that area, in hopes that the forces of nature would somehow lead the children back home.",1510444800,,1829,5.073089700996678

Also it is a part of history that needs to be remembered so we can better understand the ramifications of European authority and belief in superiority on native cultures....a similar program was carried out in the United States into the 1960's.

 Rabbit-Proof Fence is based on a true. It is a story about three girls, Molly, her sister Daisy, and their cousin Gracie. One day these girls are forcibly ripped from their home and families and sent to a school or education camp to teach them how to behave and speak properly. If they even tried to escape they would be thrown into a pit that they called the boob. In this pit they would have limited food and water, they would be beaten and have their heads shaved. Even though those circumstances seem really brutal, Molly was determined to return home to her loved ones. She watched and waited for the right time and her, Gracie, and Daisy fled the camp to embark on the road home. Once they got to the Rabbit-Proof Fence they could follow it all the way to their home. There were many obstacles they would have to face before they would return home safely. When they were on the brink of exhaustion, they make a safe return home to their families.
 This is very similar to how the Americans did to the African Americans. They would try and teach the African Americans their ways and forbid them to participate in their own personal beliefs and traditions. They saw something that was different and instead of trying to understand and accept cultural differences, they saw flaws within the indigenous communities and tried to change it. Molly, even at the young as of 14 years old, had to have a lot of faith and courage to return home.",1505347200,,1689,4.459546925566343

paced, but it showed an important part of Australian history.  I really hadn't seen
 how Aboriginals had lived.  . .and no way could I have imagined what the 1930s
were like.  I had heard about the fact that Australia had a very long fence called
the Rabbit Proof Fence and it has new meaning now that I understand these
runaway girls used it as their guide to find their way home

I would recommend it to anyone more interested in history and culture, than an
interest in Hollywood type of entertainment movies. It was to hard believe the three girls
were really actors. . .they were so believable. I liked that at the end of the movie,
we got to see them as they are today. . and to learn a little bit of their adult life.",1505174400,,804,4.2631578947368425

It does an excellent job of capturing the bond between a mother and her child. *spoiler alert*  It is amazing how these little girls were able to survive such a long journey in the Australian outback.

1455733,2,B00005JLD4,"The whole thing seemed a bit farfetched to begin with and in doing some research I have come the conclusion that this story has been Hollywoodized and intentionally embellished in order to make a quick buck. According to some sources, the two older girls Molly(14) and Gracie(10) were removed because of evidence of inappropriate interaction with itinerant White Australian laborers, which you can easily understand to be a huge scandal back in the 1920s regardless of the girl's race. While the youngest girl Daisy(8) was allegedly betrothed to some pedophilic creep old enough to be her grandfather and laws regarding half-caste children allowed the government to intervene on her behalf. In general, all 3 girls were alleged to have had a difficult life on the reservation due to their being biracial and fatherless, so the reservation chief suggested they be taken away to be looked after by someone other than their struggling single mothers. No chase or drama, just girls riding on a horse led by a government official while their families stood and watched, not making a chaotic spectacle of themselves as was shown in the film with the action packed car chase and brutalizing of the Aborigine mothers.  Even the 1,000 km trip back to the reservation from the boarding school is disputable for the simple fact that it be impossible for an adult let alone doubly vulnerable children to walk 1,000 km without adequate clothing, food and water, or a compass and map to direct them. The bare bones facts are that 3 half-caste children were removed from Jigalong Reservation to Moore Settlement in the 1930s and missing their Aborigne mothers decided to run away, however even one of the real-life trio has stated that the heartwrenching dramafest shown in this film is NOT her story at all and has been grossly distorted. It is a shame that greedy opportunists in pursuit of almighty King Dollar chose to capitalize off the experiences of others by twisting the truth and shamelessly for their own selfish benefit. Lying and manipulating like this ought to be illegal! Skip this dramafest and go read the book if you want the real story.",1478304000,,2140,4.92797783933518

1455794,4,B00005JLD4,After visiting in Nova Scotia this year and reading similar reports of treatment like this toward First Nation People it made my heart feel good to see the heroic efforts of these girls in their journey back to their families. Hopefully we can learn to not try to impose our wills onto the lives of new people we meet but rather to allow them to share their ways as we share ours so we both may learn.,1478217600,4,401,4.220779220779221

This true story of the treatment of half-breed aborigine children by the Australian government from the 1930's until the 1970's is so sad....but so compelling. Actions with the best of intentions can often have such disastrous consequences for the individuals they are meant to help as this story of three young girls taken from their mother to a far away camp demonstrates as they flee and try to make it back home on foot through the rugged Australian terrain.,1469491200,,527,4.802197802197802

The half-chaste children were considered a threat as the Australians felt they didn't want a 'third race' to grow.  Their attitude was altruistic feeling they were helping the aborigines speak English and learn a trade -- which was serving the whites.  They destroyed family units, and, in the long run, helped to eradicate a culture.  At the very end they tell you what happened to the real characters of this story and show you their picture.

This is what Progressive Governments run by ""Elite White Intelectuals""  did to stop the ""Breeding"" of less than Human peoples around the world. Margaret Sanger started Planned Parenthood in order to stop Blacks from having children, because she thought that Blacks were thes  than human. Hillary Clinton recently accepted rhe Margaret Sanger award. Yea, and she will get over 90 percent of the Black vote this year. If you don't believe me, Google what Sanger said and wrote about Blacks. She was a Racist and taught Eugenics which is the elimination of ""Inferior"" races as she wrote and taught. Joseph Goebbels of NAZI Holocost fame got his ideas from American Eugenicists like Sanger and presented them to Hitler. Six Million Jews and another one million Homosectuals, ""Handicaps and Unproductives"" perished. Most Planned Parenthood clinics today are still in Black neighborhoods doing what she wanted.

It was thought to be humane to take children from their families to be forcibly ""educated.""  This led to a long history of individuals living in limbo -- detached and alienated from their own cultures and hating the new culture that was forced on them.  A travesty that still impacts many native cultures and their people today.

On a par with ""Kings in Grass Castles"", this is or should be considered a national treasure of Australian history. It also shows that there are complex things about primitive cultures that we cannot begin to understand from the context of modern civilization. Throughout the entire story, there is the subtle thread of a question about unseen forces and what might best be described as the power of community prayer to a Creator or Mother Earth who watches over all of us, regardless of religion or lack of it, that begs careful reflection. It also raises an even deeper question of whether inanimate objects and planets have souls. Listen with your heart, pay attention to the very end including to what the girls as grown and elderly women have to say, and learn!

away from their native lives. Three sisters decided to run away, and set out on foot on a harrowing 1200 mile journey back home. They followed the Rabbit-Proof Fence to find their way.

The story was written by the daughter of one of the girls about her mother's journey. It is frightening, poignant and joyful all at the same time.

The movie shows the journey of 3 half-white children who were sent to a children's prison or camp for training into serfdom for the white population with the hope that their native blood would eventually be bred out of them.  Three sisters, the oldest 14, escaped the compound and managed to avoid trackers and two of them made the 1200 mile trip on foot back to their home, the youngest being carried on the back of her 14-year-old sister a good part of the way.  After arriving home with the protection of their people, they fled into the desert with their mother and grandmother to avoid further capture.  One of the girls tried to catch a train but was apprehended.  Unfortunately, white supremacy in all its glory and ignorance reigned and the children of the two girls who made it back home were confiscated by the invaders to be integrated into the white society.

1459175,4,B00005JLD4,"As we live our daily lives especially here in the U.S. one never knows what is happening next door, in another State or in another country.  The Aboriginal Protection Act indicated that half-caste (mixed race, half white) Aboriginal children were to be separated from their families because they were considered tainted and unpure.

The Rabbit Proof Fence based upon a true story tells about two sisters (Molly and Daisy) and a cousin (Gracie) that was set to be removed by A.O Neville the administrator of the Aboriginal Protection Action from their families because they were considered half-caste. While the girls were at a concentration camp along with other girls in similar situations they decided to escape and run back home.  Little did they know that this would embark upon a two month journey by foot to get there.

Along the way they decided to take the path along the Rabbit Proof Fence.  What is the Rabbit Proof Fence?  Its a fence that runs about  2,000 miles that is set to eradicate rabbits and other pests from spreading to the Western Australian areas. It runs along the path that lead to their home in Jigalong.

Gracie eventually was tricked by an Aboriginal young man who informed her and the girls that he would take them to their parents while Doris and Molly did not fall for the trap, Gracie was caught and never seen again.  Doris and Molly did eventually find their way back home and was joined with their families again. They settled within the outskirts of their original home town because they feared being caught again.  Little did they know was that A.O. Neville's quest to locate the girls had to come to an end because he exhausted all of his financial resources in trying to locate them

It is truly sad that this was the fate of the children and that they were being punished for being of mixed race. I highly recommend anyone that want to be made aware about other cultures and caste systems that happens to people in other worlds and countries.  Make sure that you check out this movie soon.",1451606400,,2030,4.671348314606742

1459270,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit Proof Fence is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.  It is the true story of two Aboriginal sisters and their cousin and their experience as members of the stolen generations in Australia. Because of Australian government policy, half-caste children  those with one aboriginal parent and one white parent - were forcibly taken from their families and relocated to Moore River Native Settlement in South Australia. The three main characters, 14 year old Molly, her 8 year old sister Daisy, and their 10 year old cousin Gracie were taken in the early 1930s. Children were taken to be re-educated to Western ways. Mr. Neville, the Official Protector of Western Australian Aborigines from 1905-1935, called Mr. Devil by the children, tried to justify this by saying the children are a danger to themselves. They must be protected.  The children were to grow up in a camp, become laborers and servants to white people, and marry white people to diminish Aboriginal blood. The half-castes were considered an unwanted 3rd race who needed to be bred out. They had to pray to God before meals, and speak English. They were to practice duty, service, and responsibility. They were child laborers. They were tracked down and whipped if they attempted to run away.
Molly, Daisy and Gracie escaped and began the long, grueling journey on foot back home. The whole time they were tracked and pursued by an Aboriginal tracker and an Australian constable. The girls journey took almost two months, and Mr. Neville stated that the pride and reputation of the department is beginning to suffer after the girls were missing a month. Because the girls  with Molly in the lead  were so brave, resourceful, determined, and smart, they were not easy to track. However, Mr. Neville realized that the girls were following the rabbit proof fence in order to get home. They were familiar with the fence because it was near their home.
Sadly, Molly and Daisy witness Gracie being captured after she leaves them to go find her mother. They never see her again. During the girls journey, we see their grandmother, then their mother and finally many ladies of their town chanting. They chant more and more the closer the girls get to home. We also periodically see and hear the bird Mollys mother called her Spirit Bird. These are both spiritual signs of hope and encouragement.
When the girls finally get home, they are met by their mother, grandmother, and the constable, who has a gun. He backs away and leaves when the girls mother stares him down. Molly says I lost one while she hugs her grandmother.
Because there are no funds available to capture the girls, they get to remain at home, but years later Mollys daughter Annabelle is captured and is never seen again. The nightmare continued. This practice occurred until 1970. The destruction of identity, family life and culture affected and still affects many members of the stolen generations.",1447545600,,2928,4.943089430894309

1459348,5,B00005JLD4,"This film is based on the true story of a girl named Molly, her sister Daisy and her cousin Gracie, all of them ""half-caste"" (mixed-race) Aboriginal girls who were first taken to the Moore River Native Settlement and then ran away from there. They are called ""half-castes"", because they have one white and one Aboriginal parent. The girls want nothing more than to return to their Aboriginal families so the escape and walk the 1,500 mile (2,400 kilometer) length of the rabbit-proof fence over the course of nine weeks attempting to return to Jigalong where they are from. The entire time, an Aboriginal tracker pursues them as well as white law enforcement goons set after them by A.O. Neville, self proclaimed ""protector"" of Western Australian Aborigines. The kids call him ""Mr. Devil"" and watching him speak just one minute and you instantly know why.

Neville believes that the Aboriginal people are a danger to themselves, and the ""half-castes"" must be bred out of existence. (Hitler, anyone?) His grand plan is to place these children into a camp where they will grow up. When they are grown, they will have a better situation in life, he believes, as labourers and servants to white families. His ultimate goal to have them marry white men and have families to fully diminish the aboriginal ""blood"" by the fourth generation. What a sick man played perfectly by Kenneth Branagh. The girls shine on their journey, filled with intelligence, perseverance and a love for their families that drives them to keep going even though all of the odds are against them.

The book was written by Molly's daughter and in the end we see the real Molly walking with Daisy telling us her own tragic story of having to walk the fence again and then having her own child taken and never seeing the child again. This film left me feeling very sad that this kind of thing happens in the world and that people like Neville are not locked away forever.",1440806400,,1937,4.761904761904762

1459555,5,B00005JLD4,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a 2002 film and it is a real winner. It is directed by Phillip Noyce. The book is by Doris Pilkington and the screenplay is by Christine Olsen. The cast includes Evelyn Sampi, Tianna Sanbury, Laura Monaghan, David Gulpilil, Ningali Lawford, Myann Lawford, Deborah Mailman, Jason Clarke and Kenneth Branagh. The film is told in a steady, unsentimental tone that allows the film to be powerful without the typically Hollywood use of sweeping music or other such lazy tools. Instead the circumstances of the story create the emotion. The story is a little weak at some points  once the children escape the film has a touch too many scenes of near-capture and escape to sustain the drama. Also the film (understandably) lends a lot of respect to the Aborigines  giving them a sense of mysticism that they maybe don't deserve. This is a slight problem when a key action involves a hawk that is supposedly summoned by their mothers (or something!). However these are minor complaints given the sweeping emotion of the film and the sheer power of the story. I gave this film 9 stars.",1431129600,,1100,4.814814814814815

1460190,5,B00005JLD4,"The movie (Rabbit Proof Fence) showed how the indigenous people of the Jigalong tribe endured the invasion of the western culture from their freedom to religion.  The beginning of the story showed us how these people lived in the desert and were comfortable in doing so.  Also we can see at the beginning how they were under the control of A. O. Neville, who was the Chief Protector of the Aborigines.  This power allowed him to remove any ""half-caste child"" from their families.  This brings us to the 3 of the main characters in the story who are Molly, Daisy, and Gracie.  These children had white fathers and this sealed their fate to be abducted and sent off to a place called Moore River.  Once they arrived there they were taught a new religion and were forced to adopt western culture.  Molly, the oldest, was determined to get back home with her sister and cousin, so one day they snuck away.  Molly was clever and her determination to get back to Jigalong paved the way for this story.  The way these girls were raised allowed them the opportunity to out-wit trackers and other officials that searched for them after their escape.  Even though she was young she knew what needed to be done to get back home.  Along their journey they met many hardships like not having shelter, food, and water.  But they met people along the way who helped them.  Some knew of their plight and some did not.  They stuck together until Gracie learned that her mother was in a neighboring city.  She was caught and taken back to Moore River.  Molly and Daisy pressed on to get back home.  They ultimately were successful in doing so.
As this story relates to our text book and world religions, we can see in the beginning of the movie how Molly's mother told her that a flying eagle would always protect her.  The eagle can be seen as a spirit in this movie primarily because his image was seen throughout the movie.  In African religions, the world of the spirits and the world of humans are believed to be closely intertwined.  (pg. 66) There was an instance in the story where Molly and Daisy woke up to the eagle flying over them.  At that precise moment and time they sensed and saw that home wasn't far away.  Also, as mentioned earlier, we saw how other religions were introduced into this culture by white settlers when they arrived in.  The girls were taught that their language was inferior to English. Our textbook taught us that African people were taught not only that their indigenous religions were false but also that their cultures were inferior to Western Ways of life.  (pg. 75)
Despite being ""protected against themselves"" Molly and Daisy survived the 9 week journey back home.  Molly had two children and they all were sent back to Moore River, where she escaped again.  She and Daisy continued to live in Jigalong not willing to give in or adapt to the ways of western culture.  Which is ironic because at the end of the movie there was a statement, ""many Aboriginal people have suffered from the destruction of identity, family life and culture.""

1460191,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence was a powerful movie that reflected how government leadership and Anglo- Christian beliefs can have such a huge impact on society. In this film children are taken from a small indigenous community in an effort to be groomed into Western culture.  They are known as the "" Stolen Generations"".

The film Rabbit-Proof Fence (directed by Phillip Noyce) is a true story based on the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence by Doris Pilkington Garimara. It concerns the author's mother, and two other young mixed-race Aboriginal girls, who escaped from an orphanage to return to their families. The film follows the girls as they walk for nine weeks along 1,500 miles of the Australian rabbit- proof fence to return home to their families, while being tracked by government employed trackers.

In 1931, with the Aborigine Act in place in Australia (the law gave government officials the right to seize ""half-caste"" children to live in government orphanages.), the Chief Protector of Aborigines, A.O. Neville had the power to relocate half-caste children from their families to educational centers where they will learn western ways of life and were trained to become domestic servants. Fourteen year-old Molly Craig, along with her eight year-old sister Daisy Kadibill, and their ten year-old cousin Gracie Fields were ripped from their mother's arms in Jigalong and taken far away to the Moore River Native Center.  The three girls, led by the eldest Molly, ran away trying to return to their tribe in the desert. The three girls traveled by foot, with no food or water following a fence that was built to keep out the rabbits that were overpopulating the area.  They are chased by the skilled tracker Moodoo and the police under the command of Neville.  Neville was blinded by his own Anglo-Christian beliefs and believed that he was helping these children by saving them from themselves. He believed that his actions were justified, and the government's policy was necessary as a way for the half-castes to turn the community white as the weaker aborigine gene will be bred out within a few generations.",1397260800,,2114,5.060344827586207

Rather than viewing all human beings as deserving of dignity and treating them with respect in spite of different races, traditions, cultures, and religions, this young girl and many like her were seen as threats to society. This threat could be overcome by re-training and marrying them to white men, with the result that in time the aboriginal genes would be marginalized. Meanwhile, the real human trauma caused to the children and their families, their villages and their culture, is so deep that the wounds continue to be in need of healing fifty years later.

1460282,5,B00005JLD4,"This true story set in Australia during the 1930's tells how the government took childen who where half white (called half castes) from their aborigional mothers and trained them in effect to be ""worthy"" slaves under the guise of re-education. Their reasoning behind this was to breed the ""white"" back into them. The movie centers around three girls Molly age 14, Gracie 10 and 8 year old Daisy, who ran away from the  Moore River Native Settlement and their journey following the rabbit proof fence for over nine weeks to get back home. It was amazing to see what lengths the government went to in order to get them back and what lengths the girls went through to get away. Their journey is a nail biter because at any moment they could be discovered.

 The story is taken from the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence by Doris Pilkington Garimara, it is based on a true story concerning the author's mother.  Everlyn Sampi plays 14 year old Molly and she's fantastic, Kenneth Branagh  plays the evil Neville whose job it is to remove the children. The ending is not warm and fuzzy - the epilogue is heart breaking.

FYI removing children began in 1910 and ended in 1970, with the Australian government offering a formal apology in 2008, it is estimated over 100,000 were taken from their homes.",1392508800,,1294,4.6784140969163

In this time they were consider to be uncivilized and therefore could not raise their own children. In the film (Rabbit Proof Fence) A.O Neville, the chief protector of the Aboriginals, actually think hes doing the right thing. He believes the children deserved a better life. His idea of better was to place the children in white homes to be trained to work on farm or in domestic service. They would have no more contact with their families. What makes this a horrible idea is that, there is no consideration for the parents. The mothers are well aware of the child takers so they teach the children to hide at a early age.  Its unimaginable, the fear and pain that goes through a childs mind when they are actually being taken. The film (Rabbit Proof Fence) did a great job of capturing the realism of the actual event.

1460502,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is a film based on a real story that happened in the 20th century. It is about the three Aboriginal children Molly, Gracie and Daisy who were caught by the authorities and put in home for Aboriginal children called Moore River. They were separated from their families because the white people wanted to annihilate the Aborigine people by breeding out the colour of the Aboriginal children. They are called the stolen generation.
When the three kids arrive at Moore River, they want to go back home. One morning their escape succeeds and the hunt begins. Will they get back home? The adventure becomes a fight for their survival.
We really liked this film because it has very emotional and sad parts. The three children win your heart quickly during the film and their story is very hard.
The film is starring people we didn't know. The kids do a very good job at their parts and they give them much personality. The actors really fit in their roles. The film is a real story so its a bit more emotional. The soundtrack sometimes conveys a dangerous atmosphere. Weve got a really good opinion about the film but some parts are a bit boring.
We highly recommend this film on a scale from one to then with an eight because some parts brought tears to our eyes.

1460616,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is a film with a very simple message, vividly, repeatedly, and wholeheartedly reiterated: the policy of forcibly removing mixed-race aboriginal children from their mothers and educating them in government schools was wrong. Well-meaning, possibly. Probably not vicious or vilely racist (at least as presented in the film). But certainly wrong. The implementers certainly thought they were doing what was best, both for the children and the overwhelmingly white civilization by forcing them to join the Twentieth Century.

There are innumerable overlooked wrongs in the past. Enough to keep Hollywood (and all the foreign subsidiaries) busy for many years, and as long as the white characters get portrayed as the villains, there will be a ready market for such films among the American liberal populace.

But breaking up families is what was wrong with this policy, and it is what those same American liberals are doing today. All their policies, so cherished and cheered at conventions, diminish the family. Whether it is abortion on demand, abortion without parental consent, state supervision and control of every aspect of a child's life, compulsory schooling--in public schools with no alternative, easy to get divorce, and on and on, the contemporary elite has shafted the family as assuredly as those long dead Australian bureaucrats did. One can only hope that some day their vision will be equally excoriated.",1379980800,,1437,5.3822222222222225
1460743,5,B00005JLD4,"Our professor of theology shows this film, in its entirety, to her classes on ""Theology from the Underside"" about those who preach for the oppressed peoples of the world. One must make a double-take to recognize that the events in the film took place in the middle of the 20th century, and not 200 or more years ago.

I'm loathe to say anything about the story in advance, to lessen the impact in any way. There is only one name actor, Kenneth Branagh, in a role where you have to check the credits to verify that it is in fact the famous interpreter of Shakespeare. There is inevitably controversy over the degree to which the villains are painted as too villainous and the heroes are too heroic. But that does not take away from the power of the film, which, in spite of a total absence of flashy CGI and power actors, the story is heart wrenching. One almost wants to believe that things were not as bad as the film makes them out to be, in order to dull the pain. In fact, things may have been worse. While the automobiles signal the '30's, the policies of Australia did not change, eliminating the policies carried out on the screen, until the 1970's. This era created ""The Stolen Generation"" which, if you read it from the Australian government at the time, makes perfect sense. Seen from the point of view of the aborigines, it was cruelty of the worst kind.

One can be happy that the practices depicted in this film have come to an end. This is the kind of film you may want to insist that your children watch with you (as long as you get them before they are teenagers.)",1379808000,,1580,4.389078498293515

1460748,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit Proof Fence which was based on a true story by Doris Pilkington Garimara was about what her mother endured in 1931.  The movie is a must see for everyone to truly understand what the Australian Government did to assimilate and transform the traditions and religious beliefs of the Aborigine culture.  To begin with in 1770 the British established a penal colony on the eastern half of the country and over time many colonist formed families with the Aboriginal people and over the next 130 years changed the ethnicity of the country.  The movie transports you to 1931 when the City of Victoria Australia was enforcing the Aboriginal Protection Act which developed and maintained controls over where the Aboriginals could live, work and who they could marry.  They even passed an Act known as the Half-Caste Act which removed children of Aboriginal people that were mixed with the colonist.  The Chief Protector of the Aboriginal people was a man named A.O. Neville who was in charge of enforcing the Half-Caste Act.  In the movie three girls named Molly (Evelyn Sampi) age 14, her younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and Gracie (Laura Monaghan) their cousin were removed against their will and family and taken over 1200 miles to a religious based boarding school named Moore River Native Settlement in Perth.  Moore River was designed to educate the Half-Caste children into the white world and train them to be servants and marry white men.  The goal was to breed the Aboriginal ethnicity out of them over time. This movie becomes an adventure when Molly finds the courage to take her sister and cousin and escape Moore River to get home.  Just imagine yourself as a young teenage girl having to walk or run 1200 miles to get home.  That is the distance between New York City and Tampa Florida.  Not knowing what roads or trails to take they followed a fence that divided Australia into sections from west to east and north to south.  The fence was referred to as the Rabbit Proof Fence and they followed it home to Jigalong Station.  They endured rain, sweltering heat and hunger while knowing they were being tracked by an experienced Aboriginal tracker and The Chief Protector's men whose goal was to return them to the Moore River Settlement.  You must watch this movie to witness through their eyes what obstacles these three young girls endured.",1378598400,2,2363,4.860349127182045
1460749,5,B00005JLD4,"This was an excellent movie.  It was one of the choices that I had to watch for my world religions class and I am so glad I chose this movie.  In a time when people thought taking children from their homes and putting them in internment camps was helping them.  Now the camps weren't prisons per se.  But if the children escaped they were tracked down, whipped and put back in with the others.  Their living conditions were bad at best, but the government did this for the children's own protection.  They wanted to civilize them, to make them acceptable for domestic work.  But in all it was just a form of legalized slavery, at least that's the way I saw it.  The film also had an Uncle Tom feel.  When the girls escaped it was an Aboriginal tracker that tried to track them down, granted there were some circumstances for why he did it.
This movie just helped to show that back then people and the government didn't want to co-exist with native religions.  They wanted to convert, and at times forcibly so, to what was considered the civilized religion.  This movie is very similar to the way Native Americans were treated in the past when halfblooded children were taken away, against their will, to be taught at schools.  To have their lives and culture stripped away because it was considered to be wrong or barbaric.  I cheered the girls the whole way through this movie and was glad to see they help along the way from others, though one turned out to be a double crosser.  I wanted to throttle these people that felt they were doing the right thing, that the government knew what was best for these girls, even though they were growing up happy, healthy and strong.  But this movie is set in 1931 Australia and people then were just ignorant and self-righteous.

They skillfully and bravely made their way home following the fence after escaping the re-culturalization settlement to which they were taken after being stolen from their Aborigine mothers.  Their fathers were white (the men who built the fence).  The removal of the girls from their homes was part of a governmental program to deal with the ""half-caste problem"" by training them as domestic workers.  This program went on until 1970, but its consequences are still suffered by many.  This is a remarkable account of a dark episode in Australian history.",1376179200,,791,5.00763358778626

1460853,4,B00005JLD4,"For over a century Great Britain enforced a misguided social policy that removed half-caste Aboriginal children from their mothers and placed them in orphanages where they were taught ""their place."" They became gardeners, housekeepers, cooks, maids and chauffeurs while their families mourned their absence. You will be gratified to know that this policy was abandoned by 1970 but it's shocking to know how long it had been in effect.

In 1931, three aboriginal girls were snatched from their homes and placed in one such school. This movie is a dramatized account of their escape and subsequent attempt to cross the continent in order to rejoin their families.

Not only is this story exciting, in the extras on this PG-rated, 94-minute award winner, we are given the privilege of meeting the actual women, now very elderly.

1460930,4,B00005JLD4,"I watched the movie, Rabbit Proof Fence. It was set in Australia in 1931 and was based on a true story. In the early 1900's there was a man name Mr. A.O. Neville that was considered the Chief Protector of Aboriginals. His goal was to ""collect"" all ""half-caste"" children from their native lands and teaching them the ways of the Australian people. Half castes were considered children that were half aboriginal and half white. He considered this to be a noble duty of his and he did this because ""In spite of himself, the native must be helped."" The basis of the movie was about three young Aboriginal sisters that went on a long journey back to their native home of Jigalog. The three sisters were Molly, Gracie, and Daisy. They all were ripped from their families and taken to a concentration type camp run by what appeared to be nuns. Molly, the oldest at age 14, took guardianship over her two younger siblings. While at this camp, one day Molly decided it was time to ""go home"" and they set off on an adventure over 1200 miles.
The movie touched on the vast differences between the two religions or life ways. It showed the intolerance the Australian authorities had of the aboriginal ways. For example, when the three sisters were at the camp in Moore River, the adults were adamant about the children speaking English, instead of their native language. They were expected to forget the ways in which they were brought up, and embrace the ways of the Australian people. While watching the movie, you are also able to see the side of the aboriginals. For instance, the women of the tribes performed certain rituals that I looked at as their way of protecting their daughters on their difficult journey home. The three girls had a lot working against them that included time, Mother Nature, and adult officials with a lot of man power. The end result was both rewarding and saddening at the same time.
Overall, I found this movie to be fascinating and moving. This is not a typical movie that I would normally watch, but I am very glad that I did.",1370131200,,2050,4.5885558583106265

1461205,3,B00005JLD4,"The movie Rabbit Proof Fence is a gut-wrenching true story, based on the book by Doris Pilkington. It chronicles the journey of two sisters and one cousin's escape from Moore River Orphanage in order to reunite with their family and heritage. In the early 1930s, Australian government thought it necessary to uproot ""half-caste"" children (children who were born to a white and aboriginal parent) from the only home, family and culture they knew in order to have them conform to the traditional practices of the Christian philosophy--to save them from their selves.
Placed in charge of this process was Mr. A. O. Neville, the Australian Chief Protector of the Aboriginal people. Mr., Neville saw two classes of people, full blooded aborigines, who needed to be segregated from society and the ""half-caste"", which needed to be assimilated into society by breeding the lighter skinned aborigines or making them domestic servants.
The focal point of the movie is on the three girls Molly, Gracie, and Daisy who have been seized from their small village, Jinalong, and relocated to Moore River Orphanage in order begin their training--to learn Christianity and become purposeful members of Australian society. It is here where their journey home begins as they escape from the orphanage and begin a journey over one-thousand miles to rejoin their mother. They have an overpowering resolve to stay true to their culture and get back home. The girls' determination enables them to out fox an experienced tracker, a native aboriginal man as well as the local constable.
Along their way, the three girls are helped by some of the community but it is Molly's strength and remembrance of the eagle protecting her (a story her mother had told her before they went hunting for dinner one day) that led her and her sister back home. It is this same resolve that carried Molly and her sister throughout the rest of their life as they were still being hunted for integration to Western culture.",1358899200,3,1978,4.996969696969697

1461210,4,B00005JLD4,"This superlative story takes place in 1931 in Western Australia, during a period of time when half-caste Aboriginal children are forcibly taken from their Aboriginal mothers and then raised in a government issued camp for their ""own benefit"". This was done out of concern that a third race would become prevalent and to prevent this, they thought that they could change these half-caste children back to a white Western culture over the transformation of three generations. They forced the western culture along with language, religion, and stopped the attempt to mate with additional aboriginals in order to eventually make this culture non-existent. I was completely oblivious to this policy prior to this movie and was dumbfounded to even find that it was even true and was so up until 1970.

In this movie, two sisters, Molly and Daisy along with their cousin Gracie find themselves embarking upon a journey to return home over a thousand miles away by following the ""rabbit proof fence"", that is used to contain the rabbits in order to protect the farm land. These three young children were half caste Aborigines and were kidnapped from their Aboriginal mothers and sent to Moore River Native Settlement where they are contained because it is what is thought to be best by the white Western Australian culture surrounding them. These children receive education that is motivated to train them as domestic servants and they are taught to turn them from their Aboriginal culture and become ""white mannered"". Even with authorities, headed by Kenneth Branagh, watching the Aboriginal children every minute, the girls Molly, Gracie, and Daisy defy all odds and are able to escape Moore's River. While being tracked, they maintain being one step ahead and find help from a few others along their journey but it's the determination of the girl's that keeps them going. I won't ruin the ending but this movie is a must-see. The authoritative figures, especially Kenneth Branagh, could easily be deemed immoral and evil but realistically their intentions were not to harm but to ""help"" these children because they thought what they were doing was good and helpful. This movie was extremely emotional and brought smiles, laughter, and lots of tears. The characters brought this movie to life. I don't think this movie is about racism but about cultures and religions thinking that they are helping others by implementing their ideas when in fact it does more harm than good and who are we to dictate what others believe.",1353024000,2,2515,5.045673076923077

1461268,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence, 2002 film

This movie is set in Australia around 1930 when half-caste Aboriginal children were forcibly removed and sent to government boarding schools for an education that would remove them from their stone-age lives. Three girls escaped to walk back to their mother, nearly a thousand miles. They were guided by the rabbit-proof fence that runs across Australia to control migrating rabbits. A native tracker is sent after them, but the girls know how to avoid leaving a trail (walking in streams). Some people help them with food or a warm coat. In time one of the girls is caught, but the other two succeed in returning to their mother.

This story moves slowly at times, but it presents a recreation of rural Australia from the past. Something similar went on in America for the schooling of native American children in schools that removed them from their families. But you won't see a movie about that. Sending children away to school was also used by the ruling classes of England and America at that time, and to this day. How to give children a modern education is an ongoing problem for all today.

Were rabbits native to Australia? If they were brought by English settlers, then escaped into the wild to become a pest, it would be a warning against invasive species When predators are eliminated their prey increases.

There is also a lot of material in this movie that would be great for a discussion with those who like it. Plus, from what I learned through the movie's extras, the filmmakers casted real Aborigine girls to play the roles of the girls, and THOSE girls would keep running away from the studio!

1461271,5,B00005JLD4,"This is a wonderful movie about the struggles of the Aboriginal people in Australia created by the white man during the 1930's. It is a true story based on a book written by the main character, Molly's, daughter. It is set in 1930 Western Australia and has three main characters: Molly, her sister Daisy, and cousin Gracie. They are from the Jigalong tribe and live with Molly's mother and grandmother. Molly is considered a ""Half-caste"" child because her father was a white man who had been working on the rabbit-proof fence which ran thousands of miles through Western Australia to keep the rabbits on one side. During this time A.O. Neville, a white politician, was considered the legal guardian of every Aborigine in Western Australia. His goal was to remove these children, especially the ""half-castes,"" from their homes and properly train them so they would be ""saved from themselves.""  They were sent to the Moore River Native Settlement which was 1200 miles from Jigalong. Here they were treated very poorly and were not allowed to speak any of their native languages or practice any native rituals. They were made to pray and practice Christianity. Most of the movie is about after Molly and the two girls ran away from the settlement. They were being tracked by an Aboriginal tracker that works for the settlement and the police. Molly is very smart realizing that if she follows the rabbit-proof fence it will take her back to Jigalong. They meet people along they way that give them food and/or shelter. Gracie is eventually tricked by a man they meet and she is caught and taken back to the settlement. Molly and Daisy find the strength to make it back into the arms of her mother and grandmother. After their return they all moved into hiding out in the desert. Molly married and had two children. The three of them were eventually taken back to the settlement where she ran away again with the youngest of her children. Gracie died while Molly and Daisy still lived in Jigalong. The Aboriginal Protection Act of 1869 ([...]) was the reason this was allowed to occur. Children were forced from their families and homes throughout Australia until the 1970's. They were called the Stolen Generations.

In the movie you can see how this relates to world religions by forcing the children to practice Christianity. They were made to pray and sing Christian songs. They were forced into a religion that wasn't their own. This caused them to lose their own culture and identity. This was proof that at the time there was little tolerance by the larger religions of the indigenous and their practices. This has happened all over the world to indigenous tribes. These people feel forced into the dominating religions to conform to the majority or either they feel the need to hide or lie about their practices.

This movie provokes similar disturbing images as those of our dark history: Japanese-American interment camps. Although we only see it through three innocent lives, the magnitude is just the same one way or another.
Rabbit-proof fence is a deceiving title. ""Longest fence in Australian history"" is meant to keep out of ravenous rabbits but the fact slowly reveals what is enclosed within the other side of the fence.

Don't read any further review(s) because most have given away too much of the plots.
You must pick it up and watch it yourself first.
You will see how truly a wonderful movie this really is.

Adorable little Molly is nice to watch along with her courageous and witty big sisters. There are a lot of delightful moments in this movie. And one not so: like sex slave scene.

Go get it.
Highly recommended!",1310860800,3,988,4.699421965317919

1461355,5,B00005JLD4,"I never heard of this ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" before. I have friends who live in Australia and never once did they mention this either.  This story is like a story that has been swept underneath the carpet and when  people see this movie they will understand why...there is great shame in this movie.  Where there is shame, there is courage and love.  It shows strength yet  trepidation.  This movie will move you deep down to your soul. It's hard to say when children are involved that you won't shed a tear...I shed many...some for sadness many for joy.

This movie is one the entire family should watch together.  It has many messages throughout that opens up dialoug for you and your children.  It's a well done movie.  Kudos.",1304899200,,727,4.609375
1461356,5,B00005JLD4,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" awakened me to the plight of the Australian Aboriginal people.  I didn't realize that a law was created to breed the aboriginal blood out of half-castes, as they were called.  Supposedly, it was for their own good.  To make them more acceptable to society and they can find jobs.  Sometimes it's so hard to believe how fellow human beings can be so cruel. They literally tore away children from their parents and although there was no indication in the film that they were mistreated horribly, it is still inhumane.  But in every human tragedy, a person will rise up to challenge the status quo.  The girl named Molly led her younger sister Daisy, and cousin Gracie through the desert, eluding capture by a trained tracker, until Gracie is fooled by the promise of meeting her mother a train station.  For months, nobody could find Molly and Daisy.  It's a testament to human survival.  This movie is based on a true story and at the end, you will actually see the two sisters, very old now.

Another amazing fact about this film is the children who played the lead characters where auditioned from aboriginal children who had no previous acting experience.  I commend the brilliance of Phillip Noyce and his rationale for doing this.  It made an impact in the story-telling.

Thanks, Amazon for recommending this film to me!",1303603200,,1346,4.8
1461357,4,B00005JLD4,"This movie really makes you feel for the horrors that have been experienced by the Aborigones.

It starts by showing Aborginal families hunting and playing together close to an encampment where they receive rations from the Australian government.  Mr. Neville, the antagonist that has been placed in charge of all bi-racial aborigones by the government, orders the 3 children the movie focuses on to be taken from their families and sent to a Christian boarding school.  The children are torn from their mothers and taken over 1200 miles from their home in Jilalong.  The nuns at the boarding school quickly make it known to the children they are to assimilate to their beliefs including daily prayers and forbidding speaking in their native tongues.

The eldest child decides they must run away to reunite with their families.  They trek across the outback with a tracker on their tails along with Australian police looking for them.  They find help from strangers along the way who offer clothes and food but some are not as friendly as they initially seem.

This movie is just one example of indigenous tribes being persecuted against all over the world because their way of life or their values don't sync with what is considered by most to be normal.  Mr. Neville believes he is doing the right thing by removing these children from their families to be integrated into a Christian lifestyle so they can be bred with other white people and their offspring can have their aboriginal traits weeded out of them as if being aborginal is a bad thing.  Many of these aborigines became slaves and as one you see in the movie, is sexually abused by the man that has taken her in.  It is astonishing that these events ever happened but what is even more disturbing is that this behavior went on until 1970.  Obviously we still have alot to learn about equality and allowing people to live and believe how they wish.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that wishes to know more about indigenious peoples and the struggles they have endured.",1303430400,2,2046,4.778409090909091

1461359,4,B00005JLD4,"This movie takes place in Australia where a fence is being built across the continent.  It is the story about the Jigalong Mob or Desert people that are losing their identity to white settlers.  The white settlers take kids and babies from their parents so they can be taught the ways of the real world.  A man named Mr. Neville is put in charge of the aborigines' people and his plan is to breed them with white settlers so they can eventually become white.  In the movie, kids are called half-caste if one of their parents was white.  The kids are sent to a camp and two of them, Molly and Daisy ran way and escaped twice.  The movie didn't spend much time on the camp but it would have been nice to see the daily routines of it and more ways that the kids had to convert.  Most of the movie is about the girl's passage back home.

  The movie was moving and heart breaking.  I was surprised how smart the Jigalong Mob was with hunting and losing their tracks techniques and how they can survive some pretty harsh conditions.  It taught me a lot about the ways of another culture such as honoring a spirit like the eagle they called the Spirit Bird.  Towards the end, there was a scene where a group of women were chanting and I'm convinced it was to bring the kids home safely.  It was heartbreaking to watch the kids being separated from their parents and they were not allowed to speak their own language in the camp.  It must be terrifying to be taken away and sent to a place where you had to go to church, not understand the language, make a bed, and other things you're not accustomed to.

  The original description didn't reflect the real plot of the movie and the movie could have reflected more on the fence.  I think the fence symbolized a border between white settlers and the Australian Mob or Indigenous (specific or native to a particular region) people verses the modern world.",1296345600,,1896,4.396551724137931

They will attempt the impossible and will endure a daring escape. A run from the authorities. An epic journey across an unforgiving landscape that will test their very will to survive. Their only resources are determination, ingenuity and each other. Their one hope, find the rabbit-proof fence that might just guide them home. It is a true story which makes it that much more touching. The actions in this movie remind me alot like those actions of those practicing Indigenous religions. Indigenous religions can be described as consisting of ethnic or regional religious customs under the umbrella of an organized religion. All of the hardship the girls had to go through reminded me alot of how it is practicing under a religion that is not free like it is in America. You have to go by certain rules and certain obsticles just to get to where you want to be. It was very touching to see the similarity. Another example that comes to mind that closely relates to Rabbit-Proof Fence is those who practice a Primal Religion. The two most popular terms in the present context are 'primal' and 'traditional,' They are embedded on their beliefs and they are not going to let anything stop them from what they believe in. Which reminds me of the three girls. They firmly believed in getting back to where they belonged and no matter what was going to try and stop them, they had their eyes on the prize. It is amazing to see the connection between this movie and the Indigenous Religion. Overall it was a really great movie. There was a great storyline and it was very touching, I was able to watch it with my little sister. I would recommend it.",1296345600,,1815,4.675
1461361,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence, set in 1931 in Australia, brings to light the eugenic policies of the Australian government's attempts to ""helping"" Australia's interracial aborigines or half-castes.  For almost 80 years the Nazi-like policy attempted to remove all half-caste aboriginal children from their families and place them in government camps to re-educate, convert to Christianity and give them a place in White society.  The movie leaves one feeling with extreme discontent and maybe even confusion given the attitude of A.O. Neville in that he believes he is saving the children from themselves.
 The movie tells the incredible story of three young half-caste children, 14-year old Molly, 10-year old Gracie and 8-year old Daisy as they are abducted right from the arms of their tribe and taken thousands of miles away to a notorious camp for half-castes.  At the camp there are basically herded around daily and sleep in room sized dormitory buildings where their latrine is a simple bucket in the back of the room.  There are not allowed to speak their native language and anyone is who caught breaking the rules is put into an outhouse looking shack as punishment, sometimes even receiving physical beatings as punishment.  The three young girls stay isn't very long at all as the eldest girl Gracie, hastily leads them out of the camp within a couple days and on their way back to Jigalong, their home.
 After learning about the rabbit-proof fence prior to their kidnapping, the girls use this fence to find their way back home.  Their journey, however, is made quite difficult as the expert Aboriginal tracker Moodoo is hot on their trails nearly the entire way.  The girls walk for months with almost no water or food across the scorching Australian landscape.  The only solace they find is in the strangers they meet along the way.  Even though very young, Molly is very cunning and intelligent as she leads the group back to their home as they evade Moodoo and distrust the people that try  to trick them into being captured and taken back to the camp.
 As an indigenous tribe that is being pushed out and/or being taken over by the ever consuming and expanding white man, I can see the relationship that the Australian aborigines share with the other indigenous tribes throughout the world.  The expansion of the modernized world has forced all of these tribes to relocate, adapt, to a certain degree, or be somewhat influenced by the larger governing force.  Some tribes are successful in staying true to their sacred ways while other have totally adapted to a modern lifestyle.  The saddest thing to me is when a part of a tribe is forcefully removed from their home and brainwashed into nearly forgetting the past and tribal religions & beliefs only to return later feeling like they were never there at all or that they don't belong.  In the textbook ""Living Religions"" (8th edition) in chapter 2 mentions Eliza Saunders, an Australian aboriginals who five children were taken away from her while she and her husband were job hunting.  One of her children speaks of when they return home: ""When myself and my brothers and sisters return home, we five sit there quite mute and just listen, observe. Because we were never there.""  There is no amount of apology or remorse anyone can have to heal the wounds created by aggressive colonization or inhumane government policies.  Only time and forgiveness can heal those wounds.  And there will always be the scare left for everyone to see.

1461362,4,B00005JLD4,"Human history is rife with examples of injustice in the name of progress. Rabbit Proof Fence examines the story of one such injustice. The movie is a tale of the fate of members of the ""Stolen Generations"", Australian Aborigines forcibly separated from their native culture.
This is the yarn of three young girls, Molly, Gracie, and Daisy born as half-castes in Western Australia in the early 20th century. Their fathers were white migrant laborers who had left the Aborigine mothers with mixed race babies. According to Australian law (the Aborigines Act) at the time, A. O. Neville was appointed as Chief Protector of Aborigines. Neville was endowed with the power to remove half-caste children from their families and send them to training camps to become more like the people of European descent.

The plot of Rabbit Proof Fence is that Molly, her sister Daisy, and their cousin Gracie are yanked away from their mothers in their native Jigalong and sent 1200 miles away to a camp called Moore River. The film follows the girls' escape from Moore River and trek back to Jigalong along the parts of the rabbit fence that dissected much of Australia at the time to protect farmland. Without giving up too much of the story, along the way girls meet folks of both races, for good and for ill results. The whole time Mollie and the girls are being hounded by a native tracker who works for Mr. Neville.
I watched the movie as part of a class I am taking on world religions. I chose Rabbit Proof Fence because I was interested in observing Aboriginal belief and culture in conjunction with the reading of my text book Living Religions (Fisher 2011).

Living Religions Chaper 2 describes indigenous spirituality as a lifeway. The Aborignal culture in the film appears to weave it's beliefs  into the way it lives as ""every when"", as mentioned by Fisher. In one scene, Mollie is told by her mother that a bird in the sky is her ""spirit guide"". Fisher's book speaks of the common primal religious theme of holy animals, ""Trees, animals, insects, and plants are all approached with caution and consideration"" (Fisher).  Mollie's spirit guide helps her when she has almost died in the desert and shows her she is close to home. Ritual singing is another way the indigenous practitioner connects with the spirit world (Fisher).  The women of Mollie's tribe in the movie know the children are trying to escape and are getting nearer home. They sing an apparently ritualistic song to protect and guide the girls back to Jigalong.

Today, again according to my textbook reading (Living Religions Chapter 13), all religions are under assault by globalization. Rabbit Proof Fence is a perfect example of the beginning of this assault on native beliefs. Here we see the concepts of white, supposedly refined and logical European thinking, attempting to homogenize and destroy Aboriginal culture.

This film is a fictional drama based on real events. As such, it is a powerful and emotionally moving story. It is well worth watching. You may want some tissues handy.",1296345600,,3052,4.88030888030888
1461438,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is the touching and poignant story of a fourteen year old girl's trip home after being forcibly removed from her home in 1930's Aboriginal Australia.  Molly and her sister and her cousin were taken by government officials and put into an internment camp for half-castes (people of mixed blood).  The girls escape the camp and manage to elude the police and a native tracker.  They travel almost 1500 miles through Australia along the rabbit-proof fence (a fence put up to prevent rabbits from eating the crops), they even had to make it through a desert.  The Chief Protector of the Aborigines was a truly terrifying man.  He had the power to do anything he wanted and seemed to honestly believe in the racist policies of the office he held.  The policy of removing children from their homes and placing them in these camps continued until 1970.  The children removed are now referred to as the ""Stolen Generation.""
  I really felt for the girls.  The mother explains their religion to Molly before she leaves, telling her the bird is the ""Great Spirit"" and will always look out for her, and you see Molly looking for that bird throughout the movie.  You watch their mother and grandmother pray for their safe return.
  The director did a great job showing the emotions that must have gone through the girls' minds on the trip.  The movie is filled with the beautiful scenery that makes up Australia.  The movie was filled with terrific unknown actors-Molly was unbelievably good.  By the end of the movie, I was exhausted from the girls' harrowing journey.

1461440,3,B00005JLD4,"After reading so many rave reviews of the film I was sure that I had a winner. I showed it to a human geography class and all I can say is we were rather disappointed in the drawn out, poorly acted, poorly scripted film. Moreover, the arc of the story wasn't too compelling. And the story wasn't there at all. The characters remained the same throughout, and it tried to portray real events with dissapointing inaccuracy. Peter Gabriel's scoring was a welcome surprise, however, with a sound reminiscent of The Last Temptation of Christ.

On a technical level, I was surprised that the story failed to show in any way just what it was that motivated the whites to want to ""civilize"" the aborigines (forced marriages, the common unacceptance of half-whites in their communities, etc). I am not saying that cultural extermination/relocation is a good thing in any way, or that keeping folks apart on the basis of skin color is ethical at all, but one would get the impression from this film that the natives were doing just fine until the whites showed up destroyed their idyllic culture. That simply isn't true. Their culture left a great deal to be desired (especially from a modern, liberal perspective). The status of women, for example, wasn't at all shown for what it was.

What is ironic is the girl who played Molly in the film ran away from the filming because she didn't want to do it anymore, and she was brought back repeatedly. She was also sent to a boarding school after the filming by the director! Lastly, when the real Molly Craig viewed this film, upon whom the film I supposedly based, she simply said, ""This is not my story.""

It's worth a viewing, but only as a piece of poorly scripted fiction.",1291420800,2,1715,4.634868421052632
1461441,4,B00005JLD4,"In this courageous story, a 14 year old girl named Molly perseveres through nearly unthinkable hardships as she is literally ripped from her mother's arms and moved 1,200 miles away to an indoctrination center masquerading as a school.  Along with her eight year old sister and ten year old cousin they break free of the cages, both figurative and literal, to embark on an arduous journey back to family, back to home.  Because of a eugenics based government policy in Australia, all half-caste Aboriginal children were to be taken from their parents and sent to schools.  For nearly 70 years this policy attempted to educated and breed out the blackness of half-castes.

Based on a book written by the actual daughter of Molly, this film is primarily about the three month struggle endured by the trio of little girls as they followed a rabbit-proof fence home through the sometimes very unforgiving outback landscape.  Along the way they bond, survive, and avoid the various efforts of the ""Chief Protector of the Aborigines,"" A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branaugh), and the tracker who is always one step behind the ingenious little girls.

All of the leads were wonderfully real, and had the filming been done differently I could have been convinced that this was a documentary instead of a film.  Those playing Aborigine roles displayed a wide range of emotions, and truly appeared affected by all that transpired.  Branaugh, on the other hand, acted with the quiet reserve of a man who is powerful without being overbearing, a man who believes in the misguided policies of previous generations.  The pacing and directing is purposeful; it's slow, deliberate, and effective.  At no time does tedium become an issue, despite the lack of action.  Attention is demanded by the story's power and historical relevancy.

This story and movie would be a wonderful supplement to any history teacher's curriculum, and it should be mandatory viewing for Australian students.

Stories woven around actual events are often embellished and even changed over time...hopefully to accent the positive outcomes and perspectives involved in human dramas...but often, the misrepresentations of some, ergo, the undue villainization of the British (or white race) is undeserved. I agree with one reviewer who urges people to check out the facts, so easily available on the internet....especially if the film succeeds in arousing powerful emotion, beyond the mere enjoyment of being entertained...

It begins with an Aborigine woman telling a story about her family members as you see a scene of local aborigines tracking animals in the Australian wilderness. Off in the distance, you see two white men watching these children.  They try to hide the children, but it is too late. It then shifts to a scene in a city with a man and his secretary and the names of the Aborigine children come across his desk. This man is Mr. Neville, the ""Protector of Aborigines"" and is put in place due to new legislation regarding Aborigines as of 1931. The 3 children (Molly, Gracie, Daisy) that Mr. Neville approves are set to be placed into camps because they are considered what he refers to as ""half-castes."" This means that the child has one Aborigine parent and one white parent. After the order to gather these 3 children is signed, the police officer returns to Jigalong and forcibly removes the children from their families to take them to one of these special camps. At the camp, the goal appears to be to integrate them into white culture and society and teach them the ways of white society while abandoning all of their original traditions including their native language. The camp is located at a place called Moore River and most of the children will be sent to become servants for white people after they reach a certain age.

  Even more disturbing is a scene where Mr. Neville is showing a presentation to a group of white people where he talks about how breeding can breed out the Aborigine traits and they will look white. All of this is based on a premise that the Aborigines must be protected because they are somehow dangerous to themselves.  Shortly after being in the camp, the 3 girls run away when the other girls are going to church one day. It is during a rainstorm so they wouldn't leave tracks.  Even with another Aborigine tracker, the police are having a hard time finding the girls as they try to find their way home along a 1500mile fence called the ""Rabbit Proof Fence.""

Review of the Rabbit Proof Fence

This film takes place in Western Australia in the 1930's.  It was during this time that Aboriginal children were being ripped from their families as well as their culture and traditions.  Many were living on ""government-owned stations"".  This was land overseen by the government, but also served as a means of containing these indigenous people.  The Aborigines were indigenous or native to Australia and lived off of the earth.  They were very spiritually connected to their environment and their heritage.  Molly, Gracie, and Daisy were three young girls, or ""half-castes"".  Half-caste is a term, considered racially inflammatory that refers to the mixture of races between Aborigines and Europeans.  The half-castes were viewed as inferior and the government made it their mission to try to integrate these people into society.  Molly, Gracie, and Daisy were forcibly taken from their mother's one day when they went into ""town"" to get their rations.
 Disregarding their mothers' desperate cries and attempts to prevent the girls from being separated from them, the constable showed no mercy and threw each girl into the back of his car and sped away.  The girls traveled for many miles until they reached their final destination which was an ""internment camp"".  Here the girls would be trained to become domestic workers and integrated into white society.  Molly was determined that she and Daisy and Gracie would not stay at the camp.  Molly waited until the time was right, when everyone else was attending church, and they made a run for it.  The girls had a head start by the time the camp officials realized they were gone.  The camp sent their ""tracker"" which also happened to be an Aboriginal man to follow the girls and bring them back.
 After several days, Gracie was tricked into believing her mother was in a nearby town and decided not to continue with Molly and Daisy.  She was eventually apprehended and returned to camp.  After months of walking the continent of Australia, the dangerous and arduous journey of these girls came to an end.  They finally were reunited with their mother and their native land.

 This movie was excellent and was a perfect example of indigenous culture and society that we have been reading about in our text book.  It actually made you realize how important the culture and tradition of indigenous peoples are to them.  It is what defines them and it is who they are.  They are the spirit of their land and the spirit of their land lives within them.  No one has the right to impose their beliefs on anyone else or strip them of their heritage to try to make them fit into their idea of what is right.",1283644800,,2750,4.862068965517241
1461552,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is the story of an aboriginal girl of mixed-racial heritage named Molly that is taken from her family by the Australian government and sent to be educated and indoctrinated into Australian society.  She is part of what is now called the stolen generation of aboriginal children that were intended to be integrated into Australian society as servants and workers.  The government's ultimate goal was to eliminate all traces of their heritage and homogenize Australian culture.  Molly leads her sister and another girl in an escape attempt over the Australian desert that spans almost a thousand miles.  This is a story about survival and extraordinary determination.

The film does a great job of portraying the characters as real people and not just stereotypes.  The antagonist, Kenneth Branagh's Mr. Neville, is shown to have great compassion for these children but is hopelessly misguided in his treatment of them.  It would have been very easy for them to cast him as a one-dimensional villain but they took great pains to show his actual motivations and intent.  The same treatment is given to the aboriginals, they are all portrayed as humans with flaws instead of perfect victims.

1461553,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is moving beyond words. The title refers to an actual 1,500-mile fence separating outback desert from the farmlands of Western Australia. In 1931, three aboriginal girls were taken from their mothers. Gracie, Daisy, and Molly were racially mixed sisters, known as half-castes. The Australian government had a policy that allowed them to forcibly move all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools. They belonged to what is referred to as Australia's ""stolen generations"". The training school was more like a prison. The girls were forbidden to speak their own language, they had to attend a Christian church, and were taught the ways of the white Australian culture. The three Aboriginal girls fled a state-run native settlement in Western Australia and walked more than twelve hundred miles to their home village. The film was about their three (3) month journey back home as they followed this fence. The girls showed great courage and determination on their journey by constantly staying ahead of the trackers who were hired to return them to the training school. The girls showed bravery and resolve in some scary situations. The film highlighted the negative side of white Australian's who truly believed they were doing justice to the girls by `saving' them from their primitive ways. There were also white Australians who helped the girls on their journey who knew they were fugitives. The girls never lost or forgot their indigenous ways. They believe in the power of nature and the ancestor spirits that nature possesses. A bird on this journey inspired Molly to continue forward. Rabbit-Proof Fence was based on a true story; one that should be told for generations to come.

It is fascinating to watch mostly because of the good choice of actresses for the three runaway Aborigine girls; they are quite charming and pretty, espcially the little one who plays Daisy.  Their perservence in an extremely difficult 1000 mile trek across the Australian desert to find their mother is nothing less than heroic.

It did trouble me that the characters were generally stereotypes.  I'm not familiar with what actually happened in that time and place so I can't say.  I do encourage people who take this situation seriously to do research and discover what really happened, instead of taking this film as factual.",1277596800,,770,4.930232558139535

Based on legislation that began in 1869, the Aboriginal Protection Act would expand into the 20th century, with more concise language to continue the horrendous practice of forceful and cruel child removal from half-caste families, and indict them into a racist and bigoted system whose sole aim was to bleed and breed the black out of them, and then 're-socialize' them into the culture of their guardian oppressors.  I can think of nothing more insidious and cruel.

My research led me to an article written by a woman who interviewed several of these children.  I read other documentation of 'the stolen generation', and this later led to the filming of the story of Molly Craig, her younger sister and cousin, Gracie, and Daisy who escaped entrapment at the missionary settlement where they were imprisoned.  And how, under Molly's strength and leadership, they began the arduous 1500 mile journey to return to their family.

This powerful and emotional packed film of courage, determination, and a deep sense of cultural faith is based on actual events, thanks to the book written by Molly's daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara.

I encourage you to see this heartbreaking film.  I am convince this will prompt you to learn more about the abusive and cruel policy by the British/Australian government, which 'stole' the human rights of countless children and their families by a contemptible practice of racial purification, which continued [in many places] through the 70's.

1461556,5,B00005JLD4,"Some films just touch something inside you that you didn't know was there.  For me, `Rabbit-Proof Fence' is one of those films.  It is honest, heartfelt, brutal and reaching.  It is also one of those hidden gems that don't get a lot of attention.  In fact, in a year as rich as 2002, this beautiful film was all but forgotten come awards season.  Instead, it was disregarded for big budget mediocrity like `Gangs of New York'.

Sad; very sad.

`Rabbit-Proof Fence' tells the true story of young Molly and her sister Daisy and her cousin Gracie as they escape from a training camp in Australia, year 1931.  During the years between 1905 and 1971 (HUGE time span), law in Australia allowed white settlers to basically kidnap half-castle children (that is half white/half aboriginal) and place them in camps where they were integrated into white society.  The purpose of these camps was to basically stamp out the race, forcing these young children to mate with whites in order to phase out their race.  Molly, Daisy and Gracie were stripped from their homes and brought to one of these camps.

But they escaped.

After fleeing from their brutal new home, these three girls made the 1,500 mile trek (along the rabbit-proof fence) back to their homes, covering desert for nine months.  As grueling and dangerous as their journey was, it serves as one of the most heartwarming and uplifting stories put to screen.

Adapted from the book of the same name, which was actually written by Molly's very own daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara, this beautiful film is bound to touch your heart.  The performances by the entire cast, especially these three young girls (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan), are outstanding and very raw and real.  Everlyn Sampi especially carries this film with such honesty.  I was amazed at her beautiful performance.  Kenneth Branagh (yes THAT Kenneth Branagh) is brilliantly used as the enforcer at the camp.  His steely gaze breathes a subtle evil that never overdoes it but respectfully (if you can call it that) approaches this man's wrong ways with honesty and realism.

`Rabbit-Proof Fence' is a film that broaches the subject of racism in a way that will make it a real issue for us.  Instead of tacking a slew of clichs in a row and calling it provocative (`Crash'), this film uses a subtle yet harrowing approach to give validity to a horrible atrocity.  This film makes racism real to the viewer and raises awareness of the disease.

This is a brilliant film that everyone should make a point to see!",1274400000,,2549,4.82258064516129

1461558,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit Proof Fence

The movie Rabbit Proof Fence is adapted from the book Follow the Rabbit Proof Fence written by Doris Garimara about the true story of three little girls journey across the plains of Australia. The movie takes place during the 1930's when it was customary in Australia for aboriginal children that were half-castes to be removed from their families and sent to a school to become indentured servants to the whites living in Australia. This was a standard practice during the ""stolen generation"" which was from 1869 through 1969 and into the 1970's in some parts of Australia.

The movie depicts the travels of Molly, Gracie, (sisters) and Daisy (a cousin to Molly and Gracie) that were taken away from their town of Jigalong and sent to be reformed at Moore River Native Settlement camp north of Perth Australia. The leader of Moore River, A.O. Neville signs the documents to request to bring the girls to the camp ""for the better of the aboriginal people."" the common belief system of the supporters of the half - castes movement. They believed that through separation and racial mixing, eventually the aboriginal people would be eliminated form the earth.

Once they are separated from their family, they travel by car, train, and in the back of a truck to the camp where they are to live. We first meet Moodoo or ""tracker"" an aboriginal man whose own daughter is in the camp and is himself on probation for a crime, when he returns with an escapee from the camp. The punishment we see for this girl is being locked up in a small building about the size of a port a john for days. Molly decides that the punishment is worth the crime and the three girls are going to escape from Moore and attempt the fifteen hundred mile journey back to their home village of Jigalong.

Molly knows the tracker is very good at his skill of following his prey; they must try to cover their tracks at all costs. Throughout the journey they run into people who give them food and shelter and offer support. During one such encounter they are told to stay away from the men along the Rabbit Proof Fence because they are dangerous. Knowing the fence goes through their village, Molly knows this will lead them home. Neville also realizes this would be the way the girls go to get home and establishes checkpoints along the way using Moodoo and other constables to try and catch them. The girls avoid most of the traps, but Gracie falls for a story from a man about catching a train in a near by town. Gracie breaks from the group and goes to the town to catch the train and is then captured by one of the constables.  Molly and Daisy see this happen but can do nothing to stop it or they will be caught and sent back to Moore.

 Molly and Daisy make it back to Jigalong after some struggles and hardships. We find out at the end of the movie that Molly's two children were taken away from her and sent to Moore, but Molly traveled the same journey after escaping a second time with one of her daughters. Gracie never made it back to Jigalong.",1271548800,,3042,4.509981851179673
1461559,5,B00005JLD4,"The movie Rabbit Proof Fence is about the Aborigines indigenous people in Australia. A man they call Mr. Neville ran an office that took Aborigines half- caste children from their families because of their mixed race. The main characters are three girls who are taken from their families at very young ages, to be taken to a camp where they are to learn proper manners and learn how speak English and pray. Molly, the oldest, is a very important role model for the other two girls because she is a little wiser and she has bravery enough for the three of them. The girls decide that they don't like it in the camp, so Molly finds an opportunity to escape. They ran and ran for miles and stopped along the way to get food from good people, and kept on going.
 At one point, they ran across a man who told Gracie that her mother was in a different town, and that she could get to that town by train at the next stop. At first, Gracie believes Molly when she says that he is lying, and follows. Then a few minutes later, she turns around and starts to head for the train station. Molly and the youngest girl keep going along the Rabbit Proof Fence and eventually turn around to go look for Gracie. They find her sitting at the train station and just as she starts to walk toward the two girls, a car comes out of nowhere and takes her away. At the end of the movie, the remaining girls find their way home and are reunited with their families. After they grew up and had children, they were taken away again, along with the children, and she escaped and walked all the way home a second time. Mr. Neville was in control of the Aborigines kids in Australia until the 1970's.
 I think this movie relates to world religions because it shows how punished the indigenous people were and how they weren't allowed to practice their own religions for a very long time. In some cases, as in this movie, they weren't even allowed to be with their families. Now, their culture suffers because there is no culture left. I think that indigenous people were treated horribly in the past, and since this didn't stop until the 1970's in Australia, there is no telling where else it is going on in the world.",1268697600,,2188,4.3734643734643734

1461632,5,B00005JLD4,"This was a remarkable film about three aboriginal girls, Molly, Gracie and Daisy who set out on a courageous journey through the rough Australian terrain attempting to return to their indigenous homeland after their abduction by the Australian government lands them in an internment camp. Brave Molly leads her sister and cousin on an adventurous quest back to their sacred land to reunite with their mothers while being hunted by an aboriginal tracker hired by the government to capture them. This film entails the struggles of the ""stolen generation"" during the time span of the 1880s through the 1960s where half caste children were forcibly removed, often abused and trained to work at specific menial task (1991,Fisher).

In the opening scenes Molly's mother points to a bird flying high above their heads. She informs her daughter that this spirit will protect and guide her which is consistent with most indigenous faiths. Birds are messengers from the spirit world.(1991,Fisher)The movie accurately reflects the importance of keeping one's own sacred beliefs and leaning on years of training for hunting and gathering purposes. Molly's training enables her to seek out food, cover their tracks and outwit the government at every turn. The kindness shown to these three by strangers is heartwarming and at times unexpected. You will find yourself cheering them on against a regime hypocritical enough to have sexual relations with the colored people to produce the half caste yet exclaiming these same offspring must be used to eradicate any further blending.

It is shocking and saddening to see people of high influence committed to a false theory that one race has supremacy over the other. So much so that they force their own beliefs and ways onto a people who possess their own faith which is handed down from generation to generation. Sadly this phenomenon continues even today as the western world seeks to convert so called savages to Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism etc. There is a common nonchalant attitude towards totally uprooting another groups entire way of life in order to transplant a foreign god into their lives. We all have the freedom within ourselves to believe as we are convicted too in our own hearts. Molly fights for this freedom and indeed takes her own back.",1264636800,,2296,5.1037234042553195

The girls were born to pure Australian Aborigine mothers in the northern territory of Jigalong.  During the early to mid 20th centaury Australia had policies which forced the Aborigine to assimilate into western culture.  These polices where mostly aimed at the half-castes in an effort to prevent the formation of a new race.
The three girls are removed from their mother's custody, and placed into a Catholic orphanage where they would be taught the duties and responsibilities they would need to be efficient workers.  They were forbidden to speak their native tongue and taught to worship the Christian god and saints.  In the story the girls decide to walk back to their home, a 9 week journey through the Australian bush, while evading a tracker and the authorities.
The Aborigine culture and religion is one that is sovereign with nature.  Their people are fully exposed to the natural elements.  They use a minimal amount of technology, which has allowed them to master the natural environment without creating a new environment.

Peter Gabriel receives a Golden Globe nomination for ""Best Original Score.""

Based on a true story, ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a powerful and poignant recount of three young Aboriginal girls who fall victim, in the early 1930's, to a government led initiative to purify `half-caste' children. Born out of `white man's' arrogance, the program is publicized as functioning for the betterment of the children. The supposition proposes that bi-racial (half-caste) Aborigine children are better off raised in white families. There, they will be sent to school and taught to live among white people.

A supremacist minded politician, A. O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) leads the charge in what is now known as ""the stolen generations,"" a phrase used to depict the result caused by barbaric acts of stripping children from their families, leaving behind their indigenous culture, and forcing new beliefs upon them.

As the story unfolds, what the government officials do not count on is the determination and resourceful spirit of these three young girls and their overwhelming desire to return to their native families. The journey continues as they put their destiny into their own hands and face the biggest survival test of their young lives. First, they must escape from the Moore River Native Settlement where they are being held captive.

When word arrives of the girls' escape, the Jigalong tribe turns to their sacred ways in hopes of evoking the spirit world to help bring them back home. Family members participate in rituals filled with ancient chants, rhythmic drumming, and meditation to call up strength, guidance, and protection for the long journey home. To get home, the girls will have to avoid being caught by skilled trackers, walk 1,500 miles over treacherous terrain, endure searing heat, thirst and hunger -- and the only thing they have to navigate by is a ""rabbit-proof fence.""

1461639,5,B00005JLD4,"This is a harrowing tale of three little girls who were ripped away from their mothers and their long journey home. In the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Molly, Grace, and Daisy who are being taught to hunt and live off the land by their Aboriginal Mothers. The Mothers warn the girls to hide when they see a white officer arrive. The girls have to hide because they were half white and half aboriginal, or as they are called in the movie ""half-caste"".

In 1905 The Aborigines Act was passed. ""Under this law, the Chief Protector is made the legal guardian of every Aboriginal and 'half-caste' child under 16 years old"" ([...]). In the movie the Chief Protector, A.O. Neville, uses his power to remove any half-caste child from their families. He honestly thinks he is helping the children by doing this. The way he sees it, he is providing them food, shelter, schooling, and a path to God or at least his version thereof. He fails to recognize the Aboriginal way of spirituality as an alternative. The Aborigines people on the other hand don't mind the presence of the white man and seem to get along just fine with them as long as they don't interfere. The missionaries' lack of understanding different religious cultures is to their detriment as Molly displays courage in running away from the compound with her sister and cousin and adeptness at surviving in the harsh conditions they face on their journey to find the Rabbit Proof Fence and home. She is able to elude capture utilizing skills she learned from her people, the Aboriginal people, skills that serve her well and connected her with the earth and her spiritual side. Molly's ability left even Mr. Neville acknowledging that she was a clever girl.

I was shocked to learn that Australia had such a similar repressive history when compared to the rest of the world. I had no idea that slavery existed there nor that they had laws allowing half white children to be ripped from their families, some even as babies. On the other hand I was moved by Molly's determination to get home despite the circumstances. The girls walked in the same clothing and shoes for 9 weeks, drinking from grass wells in the desert, sleeping on dirt, eating what they could find and what was offered by strangers.

Eventually, they reach the rabbit-proof fence, where they will follow it all the way back to Jigalong.

The movie relates to World Religions because it tells of how difficult it can be for someone who is different to survive. It shows that not everyone is treated the same just because of their culture and how they are raised and that there are people out there that are trying to get them to convert to living like them. These children were taught that their ways were inferior and others tried to bring them away from their culture and the things they were taught. It proves that with determination someone can escape the strife that is being thrown at them and can get to a place where they belong and where they can continue to be happy.

1461708,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is a moving tale, as much for its content as for the very fact that the film was made. One has to applaud Phillip Noyce for taking on the project, for the story of the multi-generational theft of half-Aboriginal children is not a proud chapter in Australia's history. The fervor with which so many people still defend the intent, if not the actual text, of the Aborigines Protection Act (which, among other things, allowed half-caste children to be forcibly removed from their parents without any justification) simply proves how shameful it was. Denial is a powerful substitute for guilt.

In making this film, Noyce had a monumental job ahead of him. He had to work with untrained child actors, pay heed to historical accuracy, and generate sympathy without slipping into cliches--all of which he accomplished with the aid of some stunning cinematography and a haunting soundtrack by Peter Gabriel. Noyce,  unwittingly, also ended up having to educate the children in their own sad history. (As one of the cast so poignantly put it, they ""lost their innocence"" during the filming.) Although a lot of controversy surrounds the ""Stolen Generations,"" if there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the theft of these children was anything less than a tragedy, watch the Special Features. During the scene in which the children are carried away, the actresses playing the mothers could not stop crying. They huddled in a group and wailed until their ""stolen children"" were brought back to them. Even after 40 years the tears are still flowing.

1461710,3,B00005JLD4,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a bit of a conundrum.  Upon watching this film, I was immediately taken aback with the steady use of widescreen cinematography, which graciously captured the beauty of Australia, despite the racist backgrounds.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, without giving too much away; I was unaware of the non-fiction elements surrounding these events.  ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" equally provided an unknown chapter of Australia's history, while also being an emotional challenge from start to finish.  With such powerful, and compelling, arguments for this film, why was there a conundrum?  With such strong, documentary-like features, one could expect this to be a brilliant cinematic entry, yet what was troublesome, was that ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was only about average amongst films of this nature.  From a historical standpoint, it provided a new chapter unbeknownst to me concerning the racism, or eradication of the Aborigines race from society, but the ultimate pitfall of this film is the lack of depth in a ""PG"" rating.  Not that tortured children need to run the gamut of every historical film, but there was nothing (sans perhaps one scene) that demonstrated to me that these refugees were struggling in any way.  From the moment of escape until the emotional ending, not one time did I feel that these children were in danger; every scene possible was of them receiving help from either other Aborigines or from native Australians.  When these three girls made their presence known on screen, we were at a happy moment - nowhere within the 900 miles did we see famine, fatigue, or even pain.  One could argue that the collapse in the desert is one of them, but it doesn't arrive until the end of the feature.  Up until that point, we are left to assume that this is a simplistic walk and that any cuts found upon their legs were cautiously placed on from a make-up department head on the edge of the framed shot.

I do not want to seem unsympathetic to the plight that these young girls took, it was not only a message to the Aborigines people, but also deflated the power of the Chief Protector (played by Kenneth Branagh - oddly, miscast in this feature).  This film was a struggle, it was emotionally draining to watch these girls desire nothing more than to just go home - but where ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" fails is the lacking realism.  The reality that these girls made this trek is real, the struggles and hardships of what was happening in Australia during this time is real, the help seen from within - both from locals and other Aborigines - was very real, but the physical journey seemed too ""glossed"" to truly find yourself lost within these events.  When the girls are walking, their hair remains in place, they never change weight, and there seems to be no horrifying event happen to them (i.e. bones broken, animal attacks, or even Mother Nature).  It seemed perfect, and that is what irked me about this film, the images of hope overweighed the images of struggle.  Director Noyce did not give us a balance, thus never quite reaching that true emotional punch at the end.

Secondly, the concept of the ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was surprising, I had no notion that this even existed, and after watching this film I wanted to know more.  This was another pitfall to this film.  Noyce should have given us, either in words or images, a bit of a history of the fence, and what it represented.  The symbolism throughout the film became apparent, but knowing more about this fence would have only strengthened the cause.  Finally, did anyone else wish that we could spend more time with the reconstruction camps and not with Branagh?  Again, not knowing enough about these camps, I wished to see what the religion was doing to these children.  I feel like we didn't get enough of this to fully see the horrors that were happening.  We heard Branagh's speech about ""why"" these were created, but it would have been interesting to hear it from the women of the robe's mouths.  There needed to be more of an emotional strain when these children ran away, I wanted to see that they desired to escape the teachings, not just go visit their boyfriends.

With that said, everything else that Noyce did worked perfectly.  The score by Peter Gabriel was fantastic, adding to the sounds of the Aborigines.  The cinematography was perfect.  The widescreen shots, seen on a projector screen, were breathtaking as we traveled along the outback.  ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was a decent film.  It was a great history lesson, and compelled me to learn more about a country I hardly think about in my day-to-day life.  My biggest issue with this film was the lack of ""realism"" surrounding the girls' journey.  I wanted more emotion, more hardship, more struggle - the lack of such made me feel like I, a average guy could make this journey.

1461711,4,B00005JLD4,"In the 1930's Australia where the white-man's law and world outlook is the truth, we find the story of these three little girls. In a time where aborigine life was considered a little more than a political and state matter to be resolved, it was government policy to remove ""half breeds"" (white fathers/aborigine mothers) to remote settlements where under strict government supervision they could become ""white"", at least in customs and manners, always with the underlying theme that they were not white, but needed to behave like one to be real persons, their original ""neo-lithic""mindset was carefully altered to confirm to the needs of the white majority.

Molly, the oldest and the leader of the group, is calmly independent and takes into her to get the other two children back home, the movie then centers mainly on the long trek north along the ""rabbit proof"" fence and the  chase of the government and the ""tracker"" an aborigine who is famous for not having now one escape him.

The acting by the tree girls is superb, with a touch of reality that is chilling, as you see these girls walk more than a thousand miles trough the Australian outback.  Kenneth Branagh is outstanding as the government bureaucrat in charge of the Aborigine department, whose main task in life and his mission seems to be to ""take care"" of his children *the aborigines* and save them by making them white.

They spend very little time with the nuns before they escape by following the fence (of the title) that in effect divides white from aboriginal.  I love the irony of the girls using what was meant to keep them out.  Their track through the desert is a spiritual journey complete with animal spirits, angels in the guise of benevolent strangers, fences that disappear and reappear when you believe, etc.  This movie is well worth watching but it left me with a sense of frustration wondering how many times are we going to live out this same drama in yet another setting.",1238803200,,892,4.709677419354839
1461714,3,B00005JLD4,"While there are plenty of panoramic shots of the vastness of the Australian outback, I never really felt the enormity of the accomplishment of a couple young girls walking over a thousand miles through this unforgiving land. I was expecting for the film to deal with the perils and struggles in this journey, but it dealt more with the politics of the adults trying to capture them. There was more weight given to eugenics than to establishing the personalities of the girls. There are scenes where people along the way assist the girls with food and coats, but in a walk of that distance that took a couple months, there must have been something more dramatic to deal with.(lack of water, dingos, poisonous snakes?)

The documentary in the special features was actually more interesting as you get to see the real personalities of the people involved. The scene where the girls were taken from their mother had the actors and onlookers emotionally overcome during the filming, but seemed to lose some of that power in the editing.

During a period of around 100  years, Aboriginal children were removed from their homes and placed in government institutions that had been established to train them to be domestic workers. The movie is set in the early-1930s and centers on Molly Craig (played by Everlyn Sampi), age 14, who had been taken - with a younger sister and cousin - 1,500 miles from their home in Jigalong to the Moore River Native Settlement, north of Perth. Craig led the girls in an escape and they walked back home - while being pursued by Aboriginal trackers - by following a rabbit-proof fence.

1461717,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit Proof Fence tells the gripping and extremely painful story of three young ""half-caste"" girls who were forcibly taken from their mother in Australia in 1931. These girls joined other children of mixed race in a ""settlement"" camp where they were taught values and customs against their will with the goal of making them maids and servants for the white people living in Australia. It was also hoped that without any ""inbreeding"" between white people and the aboriginal people, the aborigines would be eventually snuffed out after two generations. This story is clearly not a Disney movie; it's extremely painful but because this is based on real events the story deserves to be told very loudly and clearly so the world knows the injustices done against aboriginal people.

When the film starts, we see sisters Molly and Daisy (Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury, respectively), torn away from their mother along with their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan). The three children are moved to the Moore River ""native settlement"" camp where they must only speak English; and they must adhere only to Christian values while eschewing the values, customs and religious beliefs of their people. The girls are terrified; but when Molly, the eldest of the three, decides they need to walk back the 1,200 miles to their mother's village in Jigalong, Australia, the two younger children also choose to run away with her.

As many reviewers note, this film keeps you on the edge of your seat every step of the way. Not only is the plot as realistic as possible, the acting of the three children and the cinematography is excellent. Look also for great performances by Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville, the ""protector"" of the aboriginal people and Ningali Lawford as Maud, the mother of Molly and Daisy and caretaker of Gracie.

The symbolism of the ""rabbit proof fence"" is quite clear. It's not just a way to keep rabbits escaping into the native areas; the fence represents the white people's attempts to separate themselves from another race who they perceive to be inferior. The fence is also a way to keep the aboriginal people out of the white man's land. I am appalled that Australia continued to forcibly remove ""half-caste"" mixed race children from their parents until sometime in 1970.

Watch this film and see how the three girls make their escape from Moore River camp and make the journey back to Jigalong. Will all three girls make it? Will they evade the hunt for them by A.O. Neville and his local assistant Moodoo (David Gulpilil)? No plot spoilers--watch the movie and find out!

1461779,3,B00005JLD4,"The Aboriginal people were invaded in 1931 by white people.  They lived in Western Australia.  A special law was put into place called the ""Aborginies Act"", where every aspect of their life was controlled.  The children were named ""half cast"" because of their fathers' being white.  Mr. A.O. Neville was the legal guardian and chief protector.  He had the power to remove any ""half cast"" child from their family.  The story is true.  Molly Craig age 14, sister Daisy Katable age 8, and cousin Gracie Fields around age 10 or 11, all lived close to the Jingalong Storehouse Depot.  Molly's mother spoke of how the white man came in and set up a storehouse where food was rationed on a daily bases.  This is also where the Aborginal people received other supplies such as clothing.  Molly's father, a white man, worked on a fence named ""rabbit proof fence"".  This fence was said to be 1500 miles long and went from sea to sea.  This fence was for containment of the Aborginal people.  Molly and her mother was watching a hawk fly and Molly's mother told her that it was a spirit bird and that it would always look after her.
  The Aborginal people were extremely aware of how to track for food and had sacred spiritual beliefs which will be beneficial to this story.  Mr. Neville had told his people to go and pick up Molly, Gracie and Daisy and take them to the dormitory at Moore River.  Mr. Neville spoke proudly of the fact that once the Aborginal children were bread into white family that by the third generation there would be no trace of the color of their skin.  They would be considered white.  But Mr. Neville would be the one to decide whether their skin was fair enough to be bread.  They had to be light skinned enough to start the process.  The girls were caught and brought to the dormitory in Moore River in Perth, Western Australia approximately 1200 miles south of Jingalong.  Here they were taught how to speak English, and learned the white man's religion and culture.  The girls stayed only a few days before Molly decided to go back home.  A man that lived near the compound was known for his tracking ability and his name was Voodoo.  He would go and find the children that ran away and then return them back to the compound.  Once brought back they would be punished by whipping and left in a small building for days.  Even with the knowledge of the punishment they would receive if caught, she was still determined that they would go home.  Through their journey home they were able to stay alive by running into different people that would feed them.  They were even given coats by one lady.  Molly knew that in order to get home she would have to find the rabbit proof fence, using it as a guide.  During this entire time they were being tracked by Voodoo but due to their wisdom, they continually outsmarted him.  Mr. Neville spent months looking for the girls.  The middle aged girl, Gracie, split off from the other two for she was told that her mother was to be at a train station.  She was caught and taken back to the Moore River.  But with determination Molly and Daisy continued to walk.  While crossing the desert they both collapsed from the heat but when Molly came too she saw the spirit bird her mother told her about.  Her mother and others were singing sacred songs and praying for their safe return.  The girls made it back home and they were then covered with a dark paste to cover their light skin.
  They hid in the desert and Molly got married.  Gracie had passed away.  The Aborginal people were forcibly removed from their home until 1970.  Many suffered from destruction of identity, family life, and culture which they call the ""stolen generations"".",1220313600,,3698,4.539393939393939
1461780,5,B00005JLD4,"I was amazed at how much I could relate this powerful, beautifully-told story to our history here in North America, where there are still elders in Indian Country who experienced the same thing, being taken from their parents and forced to stay in boarding schools designed to ""kill the Indian, save the child."" So much was the same, the forced assimilation, the forbidding of using native language, the forced religion, the brainwashing into thinking that the assimilated aboriginal is better and more intelligent than the non-assimilated. So much is similar that I wish there was more relationship between Australia's ""stolen generation"" and First Nations people who survived boarding schools and their descendants.

Acting was top-notch from the three girls who had never before acted--particularly Everlyn Sampi, who is clearly a natural method-actor as the director says in the excellent making-of featurette on the DVD (which also includes a great commentary). The photography is gorgeous, really managing to capture the soul of the outback with respect and almost a sort of love. Amazingly unsentimental and never melodramatic--which is quite an accomplishment for such a dramatic, challenging story. And, while there is heartbreak, this manages to ultimately be a feel-good movie...the kind that stays with you. I don't know anyone who's seen it who didn't enjoy it.

Mr. Neville was given the task of ""protecting"" the Aboriginal people but in essence what he was doing was hoping to extract the Aborigine from the ""half-castes"", as they were called, the children of mixed parentage to make their descendants ""white"" again. The three girls were taken forcibly from their mother simply because they had a white father. In watching the movie, I wondered why the children had white fathers and in one telling scene, it appears that these women were treated as whores by white men and left to raise these children. In many ways it makes me ashamed and disgusted to be white when I see injustices such as these being played out.
This was a religious battle, as the girls were sent to a Catholic internment camp. Some of the girls had given up but in some scenes you see the joy in knowing that those three girls got away. They wish it had been them.  They still held fast to their own heritage in spite of it and you could see the pride they felt when in reading an article, it was said that the only trace they found of the three girls was a rabbit skin. They giggled over this and you just knew that they were feeling the pride of their own heritage and background, having been raised to be hunters themselves.

1461865,4,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit proof fence tells the story of three half-caste girls from an Aboriginal settlement in Western Australia. In 1931 the girls were seized from their families by police who were acting according to state policy and were taken to a government compound far to the south. The three girls escaped and made a miracles journey one thousand miles through the dessert to get back home. Along this journey they followed a fence built north to south to keep the rabbits out of the fields. The girls did receive food and help from some they encountered along the way. The movie shows us about the horrible Aboriginal child removal policies in Australia during the 20th century.

In the early 1900's Australians were worried about the increase in half-caste children. They believed each half-caste to be a ""menace to the future moral safety of the community"". So in 1905 Australia passed a law to allow the removal of half-caste children from their homes and were to place them in Christian missions or State run institutions. The law was nothing more than an attempt by the government to rid Australia of the Aboriginal people and their beliefs. The government didn't understand the Aboriginal tribes and didn't give their ways or beliefs a chance. Sadly it took until 1970 to end this law and this movie is a reminder of the horrible things the Aboriginal children endured.

This I thought was a great movie and is well worth watching. It does make you angry when you think about the governments and global religions who try to change the ways of the indigenous people throughout the world. It is no governments or religions place to say they are better or more right then another with a different belief. We need to learn more about others beliefs and ways of life before we try to impose ours on them. We might think ours to be better but you can see from this movie our beliefs and ways of life don't always make others happy.

Although I have no way of knowing if the facts of the movie are consistent with the true events, there was one critical thing that could have made this movie timeless.  What I am suggesting is that a brave director will at some point address the same subject (probably not the same story) with grit and realism.

The problem with the movie:  These girls acoomplished an increadible feat which the movie does not come close to presenting.  However, the three young actors did a great job.  The viewer gets the impression that everyday there was a home or person available along their entire walk to feed them.  I'm guessing this was not the case.  The director needed to provide the viewer with a sense of time and distance traveled which I never felt.  Besides trying to avoid capture, the director gives you the impression that the only hardship occurred during a single day while walking through the desert when they collapsed only to be saved shortly after by the sight of a raptor.  I am sure it was not that easy.

Lastly, although not related to the movie, I found it funny to see Kenneth Branagh's larger than life portrait on the cover of the DVD as if he was a primary character in the movie or contributed anything significant to the project.

Sampi is marvelous as the scrappy and stoic eldest child, traipsing through the barren outback in tattered clothes and scavenging food with her clinging siblings while evading tracker Moodoo (David Gulpilil).

1461950,5,B00005JLD4,"Between 1905 and 1971 the Australian government had enacted a policy of forcibly removed all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools. The grown daughter of Molly wrote a book about her mother's experiences and this movie is an adaptation of that true story.

In 1931, Molly and her younger cousins, Gracie and Daisy, were three half-caste children from Western Australia who were taken from their parents under government edict and sent to an institution, were taught to forget their families, their culture, and re-invent themselves as members of ""white"" Australian society. The three girls begin an epic journey back to Western Australia, traveling 1,500 miles on foot with no food or water, and navigating by following the fence that has been build across the nation to stem an over-population of rabbits.

Though the movie shows that the government's officer in charge had essentially good intentions. That these actions brought about by this policy were misguided and ultimately very destructive to Australia's Aborigine people and to the nation's moral fabric.

Not to mention some depth into any of the characters. Not even the school master, the tracker, the people that help them along their sojourn, or any other character with any time on screen. We never feel we really know any of them. Still a great story about how between 1905 and 1970 the Austrailian government took half cast children and made orphans of them.

1461953,4,B00005JLD4,"This movie tells the story of three aborginal children who were kidnapped from their mother and taken to a faraway school in order to be indoctrinated into white Australian culture. This was the policy of the Australian government towards ""half-caste"" children, meaning those born with one parent who was white and one who was aborginal. In some ways it was similar to how the United States built schools intended to assimilate American Indians into mainstream white society.

The rest of the movie depicts how the three kids escape and then, with tremendous bravery and determination, make a 1,500 mile journey on foot to home. It's an extraordinary story that covers an important aspect of Australian history that remains unknown to many people. So, on that level, I enjoyed the movie.

But what keeps it from reaching the highest level of cinema is that the movie is basically a simplistic ""morality tale"" with very little nuance or subtly. Of course, the three girls are inherently heroic. But I would have preferred that the rest of the cast were portrayed with greater depth and a wider diversity of perspectives. Instead almost all the white Australians are depicted as simplistic villans, with a few bad ""sell-out"" aborigines thrown in for good measure.

History teaches us that the interaction of cultures involves a complex dynamic with a wide diversity of personalities and both sides generally attempting to do what is in their own self-interest. This holds true even when one side is clearly more powerful and therefore able to generally dominate and victimize the other, as was the case between whites and aborigines in Australia.

I still consider this a movie worth seeing. But I do wish the movie had a bit more depth to it, particularly in terms of character development.",1176336000,6,1789,4.993288590604027

1461957,5,B00005JLD4,"For 25 years, through 1940, A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) served as the Australian government minister in charge of Aborigine affairs. This movie portrays the true story of several of his victims.

The government authorities rounded by Aborigines and forced them to live in allotted areas, where they controlled every aspect of their daily lives, right down to how many pairs of shoes each individual could receive. The worst lot fell upon the mixed children of Aborigine mothers, whom this movie implies were often (if not always) raped by white men.

In 1931, Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), then 14, her sister Daisy Kadibill (Tianna Sansbury), 8, and their 10-year-old cousin Gracie Fields (Laura Monaghan) visited the Jigalong trading post with the girls' mother Maud (Ningali Lawford) and their grandmother (Myarn Lawford) and found themselves hunted down like rabbits by the government's police, whom Neville had authorized to kidnap them to be raised at Moore River, a ""school"" camp to ""civilize"" Aborigine ""half-castes.""

The school was in fact a sort of prison; frequent escapees were tracked and quickly returned. And even their tracker, Moodoo (David Gulpilil) was effectively imprisoned there. Not only was his daughter also a victim of the government policy, but he was refused frequent requests to return to his home. Much like the children of Native Americans, kidnapped and confined to similar ""English only"" schools until well into the 1960s, these girls were mistreated badly, and had their hair cut off for daring to speak Aborigine--or, heaven forefend--escape.

Before the girls' capture, Molly had often seen the ""rabbit proof fence,"" constructed from north to south across Australia to keep western rabbits out of the pastures and ranch lands. Her mother had also shown  her the ""spirit birds"" (whistling kites), which she'd said would always watch over Molly.

And so it is that, after being transported in cages, by truck and train, some 1,200 miles from home--and  a very brief separation from their family--the girls follow Molly's lead and set out to return home. The film mostly tells of their nine week journey across harsh outback and desert--to the background music of whistling kites and Australia's haunting Aboriginal didgeridoo, the lengthy, 1- to 2-meter low-toned wind instrument.

Adapted from the book of Molly's daughter--the award-winning author, Doris Pilkington--the film very effectively personalizes the plight suffered by many Aborigine parents and children from 1905 through 1971. Molly Craig died in January 2004, at the age of 87.

Unfortunately, several governments still separate children of ""unwanted"" minorities from their parents, to this day. These aren't the ""Western colonial"" governments that viewers might expect; They include Hungary and Romania, who target Rom children and families, as well as African and Asian governments, who persecute other minorities.

Moreover, historically, separating minority children from their families and raising them differently was and remains a time honored practice within the institution of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Islamic-jihad/dp/1591026024/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Islamic jihad</a>.

1462001,5,B00005JLD4,"This has definitely been one of the most moving and inspirational films I've watched recently. Between 1900 and 1970, at least 100,000 Aboriginal children of mixed blood - called ""half caste"" - were taken from their families by the Australian government. Some were surrendered with their parents' consent, but many were forcibly removed. They have been referred to as the Stolen Generations. These children were placed in government or church-run schools in an attempt to assimilate them into white culture. The living conditions in these institutions were generally poor. The children were also discouraged from speaking their own languages, and also from marrying full-blood Aboriginals, the belief being that if they intermarried with whites instead, all Aboriginal traits could be ""bred out"" within four generations. It was common for children to attempt escape from these facilities, but most never made it far before being recaptured. This story, however, is different.

The film ""Rabbit-Proof Fence,"" based on the book ""Molly's Daughter"" by Doris Pilkington (which is in turn based on the true story of her own mother), follows three girls in the 1930's - two of them sisters and the third a cousin - who are taken from their family as described above. They are placed in the Moore River Camp, almost 2000 kilometers from their home. It is not long before the eldest girl, Molly, decides that they must escape and return to their family. Molly (14 years old), Gracie (10 years), and Daisy (8 years) soon find their way to the rabbit-proof fence of the title, a structure bisecting the entire continent with the aim of keeping rabbits on one side and good farmland on the other. Knowing that their village lies along the fence, they set out on an arduous nine-week journey to follow it home, all the while tracked by those that want them recaptured.

This is an amazing film in so many ways. The casting all around is brilliant, but the three girls who play Molly, Gracie, and Daisy are particularly remarkable. None of them had any previous acting experience, but their performances are completely natural, neither underacted nor over-the-top. Most amazing of all is Everlyn Sampi (actually 12, though her charatcer is 14) as Molly, and Tianna Sansbury as young Daisy is also incredibly talented for a 7-year-old. I hope both of them choose to go on to work in other movies, because they truly have a rare natural talent. The rest of the cast is also superb, with the notable Kenneth Branagh taking a key role as A.O. Neville, official ""Protector of the Aborigines"" in Western Australia.

The cinematography and soundtrack are also quite perfect. One really gets a feel for how beautiful, and how rugged and forbidding, the Western Australian desert country can be. For anyone to have made a 1,500-mile journey across it on foot is remarkable, and for this to have been accomplished by such young children is truly inspirational. The film also shows the complicated interplay of race relations quite well. It is not a clear-cut black-and-white issue (and clearly the protagonists are neither fully Aboriginal, nor fully white themselves). There are of course characters firmly planted on one side or the other, but there are also many stuck in the middle, such as the Aboriginal man employed as a tracker to recover the runaways, or the half-caste laundry woman - herself a former ward of the Moore River Camp - who attempts to help them along the way. These characters hightlight the turmoil of being stuck between two worlds. It should also be noted that not all white people in the film are portrayed as villains, as we see the girls aided by sympathetic non-Aborginals as well.

The DVD offers only two special features - commentary with the director, screenwriter, author, and Kenneth Branagh, as well as a documentary on the making of the film - but the documentary, ""Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is well worth watching. I was touched to see how intent director Phillip Noyce was on getting the movie just right, so that it would resonate with both the descendants of those included in the Stolen Generations, and with a white Australian audience. The lengths he went to in order to find just the right three girls to play Molly, Gracie, and Daisy - flying to numerous remote towns to interview hundreds of children - are also impressive. Even more touching is to see just how much the young actors put into the film. In one shot we see the entire cast and crew reduced to tears after filming the abduction scene at the beginning of the movie. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this film to any viewer, and plan to add it to my own collection as well.",1157241600,6,4675,4.8841309823677586

It's a story on many levels - the pain of separation, the yearning for home, the traps of culture and ideology, the power of the state, colonialism, faith and survival. It painfully depicts the policy of cultural and anthropological genocide of the Australian Aboriginal Peoples. And it's a moving story of great courage and the strength of the human spirit. The little girls will stay with you for a long, long time.

This isn't an easy film to entertain you for a short while.  It gets hold of you and twists your stomach. It takes hold of your heart too, and lifts you out of your armchair in elation, and triumph. It's not a film that you forget.

In 1931, three aboriginal girls are forcibly removed from their homes to be trained as domestic staff for white families. They escape and set off on a trek across the Outback.

Rabbit Proof Fence is a cinematic statement against the lack of respect that 'civilised' societies have for other cultures. It also illustrates the infinite power of the human spirit with outstanding simplicity for it's a simple enough story based on real people and events. It conveys a solemn air of the determination and maturity of soul of the girls in the story and richly characterises the Outback to which they return as a reflection of their stone-faced will and intensity.

Molly escaped and led one family member home following Australia's ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" back to where she belonged.  Later, she and her children were recaptured and sent back to the camps.  She escaped a second time with a babe in arms and came back to her home.

This is a harsh piece of history to view.  Frankly, some of the discussion of how Australia was planning to 'assimilate' the Aboriginals truly offended and horrifed me, but this is a piece of Australia's history and quite effectively mirrors our own in the US with respect to American Indians.

""Rabbit Proof Fence"" is beautifully filmed, scored, and performed.  The actress who played Molly is effective, powerful, and evocate.  Aborignal actors and consultants were used to make the film have the look and feel of a period piece and be a true reflection of Aborignal culture.

Despite portraying itself as a defence of Aboriginal cultures, Rabbit-Proof Fence censored out all their morally confronting aspects. There was no portrayal of the arranged marriages, tribal conflict, and polygamy that had motivated the policy of removing children in the first place. So extreme was the cultural censorship that, in one scene, the ladies catch a goanna for a feed, but rather than show it being killed, there is only the sound of its death. At the end of the movie, a notice reads that no animals were harmed in the film. Presumably, the director, Phillip Noyce, felt the audience wouldn't be able to come to terms with the fact that Aborigines killed native Australian animals to sustain themselves. Even stranger than the notice that animals weren't harmed, was the issue of clothing. Noyce never depicted Aborigines in their traditional state of undress. Maybe this could be interpreted as a sign that Mr Noyce never read National Geographic as a child, so he grew up with a puritanical approach to nudity. Really, what is the point of making a movie in defence of traditional Aboriginal cultures, if you can't even bring yourself to show them, or help people understand them.

The policy of removing children, and assimilating them, stemmed from an inability to come to terms with these moral confrontations. Although the story shows that assimilation was a method in the past, the way the story was told shows that denial is the method of the present.",1148083200,20,1573,5.026819923371647

The film, based off the novel of the same name written by real life daughter to Molly Craig, Doris Pilkington Garimara, chronicles their capture and escape in brutal detail and puts you in their shoes.  A little background info for you, in the years between 1905-1971 the white settlers in Australia enforced a law that allowed all half-caste children (that's half aboriginal and half white) to be taken from their homes and brought to camps where they would be assimilated into white society.  The purpose was to stamp out the race.  They wanted these children to mate with other white men, and their children to mate with whites and so on and so forth until any traces of aboriginal desendence would be gone.  Kenneth Branagh (who resembles Ewan McGregor) plays the enforcer and owner of all aboriginies (it's explained in the outset of the film) and thus he's the villian sort-a-speak.  After the girls are uprooted from their home and placed in the camp they decide to escape, and escape they do.  The rest of the film follows them as they trek for 9 months through the Australian desert, following the rabbit-proof fence, a 1,500-mile fence separating outback desert from the farmlands of Western Australia.  There journey is a heartwrenching, heartwarming story of their desire and need to be who they are.  What is so important about this film is that at times we only see racism in this country, which to be brutally honest is the [...] of too many jokes, and so to see how others were treated sheds light on the subject and hopefully will help others see a need, maybe even in our own homes.  It's crazy how we, as Americans, know of racism, know of slavery...we're taught it in schools and reminded of it everytime we see shows like 'Black/White' and at times it's shows like that that make racism seem more like a joke then a reality, but while watching this film my wife and I started talking and you really start to see what racism really is and that it is a serious problem.  To hear the men in this movie talk about their beliefs and how they feel they are helping these people by in an essence 'making' them white is horrible.

1462113,1,B00005JLD4,"Last night, having mistakenly taken the video store owner's recommendation, I watched the movie Rabbit Proof Fence. As soon as the opening credits began, I realized what was in store for me - ethnic praising, white bashing - but I watched it anyway. Even though I'm keenly aware of anti-white propaganda in films, I was still amazed.

The stereotyping was so blatant and over the top. The white people were monstrous in their punctiliousness, their coldness, their stupidity on the grand scale. And they were contemptible in their cowardliness, laziness, lack of perseverance. The aborigines were brave, loving, kind, self-sacrificing, polite, gentle, wise, determined, in touch with nature, cleverer than the whites, etc. No indication that they'd be driving cars into kangaroos for sport in a few decades.

Whites have been primed for years to accept such distortions without objecting.

Then I remembered a movie I saw in my childhood, probably over 30 years ago - ""Crazy Horse."" As I remember it, the chief himself was a noble hero and the most hideous character in the film was an ugly faced white military leader who gave the Indians a gift of thousands of blankets contaminated with smallpox.

Being brainwashed like this is the reason that White people don't do enough to protect themselves and their civilization. The Australian government's policy of removing all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools was not perfect, but it was not racist. The whole point was to take the children away from a primitive stone-age culture so that they could become part of modern Australian culture. In other words, it was inclusive.

This film is about racism all right, but it is about the racist stereotyping of whites as evil and every other race as good, and it is about brainwashing Whites to hate their own culture and race so that they will sit idly by while it is destroyed by minority empowerment, historical revisionism, and mass immigration of more `good' people (i.e. non-Whites).",1139356800,37,2008,5.072727272727272

Ever since I got the soundtrack album for it, composed and performed by Peter Gabriel, I knew I had to check it out, since Peter never lends his name to productions that are not worth it. Indeed the wait was totally worth it! The movie combines visuals, music and performances in a way that I can only relate to the experience of watching ""Until The End of the World"" or ""Whale Rider"".

The story takes place in Australia, during the first part of the XX century, at a time when the lives of the aboriginal people were controlled in an absurd manner, obligating them to do things for their ""own benefit"", such as separating the young children from their parents. Three little aboriginal girls escape a camp where children are kept and walk back over a thousand miles by the rabbit-proof fence that they remember leads back home, in an effort to reunite with their mothers.

The performances by the girls, who were new to acting, will leave a deep mark in you, as will the impeccable music that accompanies the shots of the incredible spaces of the Australian outback. In a nutshell, ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is well worth watching and, considering the movie is based on real-life stories, the movie makes you gain a deep respect for the aboriginal people of Australia and what they had to endure.",1138060800,7,1346,4.604166666666667

From my own experience of two years living with Aboriginal peoples, I can vouch that it is remarkably authentic.  This is how Aboriginal people really look, act, and think.  Compare it to the rubbish that is ""Mutant Message Down Under"" and you see the point.  The filmmaker was not trying to start a cult movement like the Mutant lady.  He was trying to tell a story--a true story, an amazing story, a tragic story.

Other traditionalist movies, like ""Whale Rider,"" also do a good job of conveying the lives and thoughts of native peoples, but this one is uniquely realistic.  If you watch the extras about the making of the film, you will be even more astounded, since the director used real-life Aboriginal people who had never acted before.  It is a truly awesome accomplishment and adds depth to the realism.

Now that you have watched the movie, go to your local library or bookstore and learn more about the fate of the Aboriginals, as well as that of the Native Americans and every other traditional society that came under the heavy hand of colonialismm and Western paternalism.

Now focus on one strong and loving family and picture the police coming to take three young girls away.

So, yes, this is powerful stuff.  The girls are sent to a center, where they are to learn English, manners, and simple skills.  The girls escape, and begin a trek that will span 1200 miles through some of the roughest tarrain on earth.

The story flows naturally, and requires very little dialogue.  Yet, the story told is pregnant with meaning and emotion.  I felt as though I had been dropped into this era.

I was confused about the tracker's daughter being there as I understood the settlement to be for half caste children.  How did he get a half caste child then? Surely this was impossible unless they (the goverment) took full Aboriginies as well.  I cannot imagine him being married to a white women with all those crazy racist rules that were being implemented.  I found the children very beautiful and the racist system of Austrailia sickening.  They should look back at this slice of their history and be deeply ashamed.,1133568000,,727,4.73015873015873

1462119,5,B00005JLD4,"I originally saw this film in our local theater and left singing its praises.  I recommended Rabbit Proof Fence to every friend I have, and I think the DVD does a worthy job of bringing the film to the small screen.

In addition to the film itself, the DVD has only a few special features.  The most moving by far was the behind-the-scenes documentary.  At one point, they show how filming the scenes of the girls being ripped away from their mothers affected the entire cast and crew.  Clearly, this film didn't only touch its audience but everyone involved in making it.

See the movie; buy the DVD.  It's a must-have for anyone whose collection includes thoughtful, thought-provoking works.",1123545600,4,693,4.773109243697479
1462120,3,B00005JLD4,"We've been trying to see this film for a while now, after having missed it in the theater. I was interested because it had a score by Peter Gabriel, who has great taste for movies with which to lend his efforts (e.g., Birdy, The Last Tempation of Christ). It also had Kenneth Branagh in it, whom I don't follow as much as I used to given his recent track record, but when he's good, he's very good. And in this movie, playing the part of Mr. Neville, the ""Aborigine Protector"" of Australia for 25 years, he shines. There's nothing more unctuous than a man who thinks he is doing the right and noble thing, which we can view in hindsight as a truly horrible policy.

The story is set in 1931 during the Australian relocation of half-caste children to an orphanage that tried to instill white culture and identity on them. The three girls that the story follows are taken from their home and transported to the Moore House 1200 miles away, then run away to make their way back home by walking, mostly using the rabbit-proof fence as a guide. The director doesn't attempt to explain much beyond the initial subtitles that set the time and scene; in fact, in some scenes, his ""show"" has to be interpreted, albeit it is usually obvious enough (such as the white man visiting the half-caste cleaning woman on his farm in the middle of the night). Branagh's Neville is a central focus, ostensibly the villain of the movie, but he comes across as simply a bureaucrat with no empathy for the aborigines that he is supposed to be the protector of. The scene in which he explains his goal of breeding the color out of the half-castes makes clear that his protectorship was more oriented to the whites than the aborigines.

One finishes the movie simply shaking your head in disbelief. It's hard to conceive walking 1200 miles (or more, given the wrong turns and need to avoid capture) across the Australian outback without dying of hunger or thirst or simply getting lost. And it's hard to believe in a people that would engage in such practice of separating mother from child, as recently as 1970. As Americans we can't be too critical of the Australians, however, because our actions with our own indigenous people were hardly noble or just and just occured a few decades before the Austrialian debacle.

I enjoyed Rabbit-Proof Fence, although I'm not sure I'd recommend it to just anyone. It's pleasantly short, which is good, because there wasn't any need for it to be longer given the story, but also the brevity helps the film make its point without belaboring it.",1120694400,4,2559,4.63215859030837
1462121,5,B00005JLD4,"According to Molly's own daughter, Doris, Molly said 'this is not my story' because her story did not end at the happy point that the film stopped on. Unfortunately Molly later lost 2 daughters to that self-same Moore school. Simply watch the film, and the special features (which are excellent). Listen with your ears not your biases and you will hear for yourself.

This is a touching, moving, unforgettable film about another appalling moment in human history. A must see. Thank goodness the filmmaker chose to end on a high note, anything else would have been unbearable.",1120089600,4,575,4.927835051546392
1462122,3,B00005JLD4,"This rather well made & enjoyable Australian film is billed as a true story.  We are shown an individual, half-caste, Aborigine girl by the name of Molly Craig as she is forceably taken from her mother and thence to a place called Moore River to be brought up amongst whites.  All the children at Moore River, we are led to believe, have similarly been remanded here for their own good and against their and/or their parents' will; the director all the while conveying the view that---in this manner---the Australian government went about trying to extiguish Aborigine culture, by removing half-caste (ie., those with one white parent) Aborigine children from their families to be brought up as white.  The focus of this film concerns a young girl (named Molly) as she walks over a thousand miles back to her mother, after she escapes (with her 2 sisters) from Moore River.  The guardian of that institution (played by Kenneth Branagh) is portrayed as one determined to locate these girls and have them forceably brought back for their own good.  It's a remarkable story actually---the girl Molly did in fact walk over a thousand miles! back to her mother & home in the 1930s (by following a low ""rabbit proof fence"" through western Austalia.  The real Molly Craig, when viewing this film, however, declared ""This is not my story.""  She wasn't actually taken by force, for instance.  Her step-father even consented to her being sent to Moore River.  Moreover, the 1936 Royal Commission into treatment of Aborigines showed that 1,003 of Moore River's 1,067 children weren't ""stolen"" but voluntarily brought by their parents to get a schooling or be safe ; for their own good (as half-castes were sometimes harrassed and/or shunned by other Aborigines).  Read all the details yourself from the Australian Civil Liberties Union at this address: ([...]) To boot, the illiterate girl who portrayed Molly Craig in this film herself ran away from the making of this picture; not once, but twice!  And after the film was completed she was then sent to boarding school by the director (yes she was brought back twice too, to complete the film) until she decared she didn't want to be there either; wanting simply to go home---a desire she was ultimately granted.  The director declared that he was only trying to help her---notwithstanding the film's Kenneth Branagh character saying the same thing in the film while being presented as a racist.  Mind you, I LIKED THE FILM.  It was well shot.  The children actors were very believable.  The Australian landscapes involved herein were captured to great effect too.  The problem is---after reading up on this for several hours on the internet---I know not what's true and what isn't concerning the story of Aborigines in Australia; except that the director of this film apparently took an awful lot of liberties with the story on which he based Rabbit Proof Fence.  That the director had the audacity to put a photo of the real Molly Craig at the end of the film, too, inclines me to not recommend this film.  But I won't go that far since I actually liked the film.  Instead, let me suggest that you not take all you see and hear in this film as necessarily part of the notion that ""This is a true story.""  And should you decide to give this film a try do at least have  a look at the article I've indicated above.  Thanks for reading my thoughts herein & I hope you take them in the spirit in which they were offered; honestly, I find it hard to understand why folks wouldn't want more information when it's rather pertinent, I think.

1462269,5,B00005JLD4,"I looked at this film about a year ago and recommended it to alot of my friends and they all felt, me included that it was an excellent film.

Not only was it captivating, but it was also very touching as well as educational.  The journey the girls had to endure, the scenery and the interview at the end gave credibility to this story.

This is a must see for students studing civil liberties in high school and college.

Upon reading another review, it was mentioned that the story was not true and aborigines were not forced into these racists camps but they went voluntarily and the story is a fabrication.  The reviewer went so far as to post a website source written by none other - Andrew Bolt - of the Herald Sun which by the way is a subsidiary of Fox News Corp. This webiste offers a very critical view of the movie as being a fake but it is just an opinion.  If you're looking for facts, go to the australian government website and do your own research.

1462270,4,B00005JLD4,"To begin, I question the head-scratchingly off-point marketing campaign used by US marketers to promote this stellar overseas release.  'Rabbit-Proof Fence' tells the amazing, true-life saga of three young Aboriginal girls, kidnapped by the Australian government as part of a terribly misguided forced resettlement program.  These three girls are reflective of what Australians now call the 'lost generation.' The policy is now universally seen as a colossal blunder in this proud nation's history.

In the Australian and EU marketing campaigns, we know exactly what the movie brings: it features a stirring image of two of the girls - Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury - obviously struggling through the Outback, fence on their right, foreboding sky in the background.  In short, a succinct and indelible image of what the film is about.

So, how is US release marketed?  With a huge picture of Kenneth Branagh, in 'hero pose' no less, eyes scanning the horizon with intent purpose.  Which would be fine if (a) Branagh was the star, and (b) he was the hero.

Much to the contrary, Branagh is the movie's villian.  In fact, he is the villian to such an extent that he's referred to in the film as ""Mr Devil.""

This is how you decide to market the movie?  Pathetic.

It's a shame, too, because 'Fence' itself is a wonderful movie, both stirring and educational.  Even better is the ""Making of..."" DVD extra, which centers on Director Phillip Noyce's efforts to find and cast his three young stars.  You will be left open-mouthed at the magnetism of the oldest of the selected trio, Everlyn Sampi.  And Tianna Sansbury's screen test - included here uncut - will blow you away, just as it did Mr. Noyce.  If ever there was such a thing as a natural actress, little Ms. Sansbury is it.",1112832000,11,1781,4.847682119205298
1462271,5,B00005JLD4,"Based on a real story of three half-white, half-Aborigine girls who were legally kidnapped and torn from their mothers in a small Australian village, Rabbit Proof Fence is a compelling, never sentimental, fast-paced account of an odious racial ""purification"" program exercised in Australia from early 1900 to 1970, giving these poor children the tag ""The Lost Generations."" Mostly these poor children were kept in camps where they were to be, ostensibly, taught in the ways of Australian white middle-class society so that, after three generations, their ""blackness"" would disappear. But in truth these children were really trained to be domestics or slaves for white land owners. In the film, we get to know the three girls and find that the oldest, Molly, is very street smart and perceives that the camp she and her cousins are in is a deadend. There's only one thing to do: reunite with their mothers, so they make their escape. Much of the film shows us the harrowing journey that these three girls make and the spiritual strength, inspired by the bond between them and their mothers, that they draw from to make their dangerous trek in the desert. What's remarkable about this film is how dead-on the acting is from the three girls, ages between seven and thirteen. The director, who discussed in great detail the casting in the documentary section of the DVD, says that finding the right girls would make or break the film. He shows how he gained the girls' trust, taught them to act (they were not professional actors), and most of all, explains how they lost their innocence and connected themselves to a part of their history that until then they were not clear about. This is the only DVD where the documentary footage on the making of the film is as compelling as the film itself. To see these girls blossom as actors and raise their social consciousness in the process, maturing as human beings, both on and off the camera, is a remarkable thing to witness.",1112054400,3,1970,4.814159292035399

To think that children where pulled away from their parents and driven miles away to very strict schooling and no freedom, is just barbaric. But these three girls walk home. And this is the story about their courage and how they followed the guidance of their ancestors to achieve this. The great female and aboringial wisdom broke all distance and you are left wandering whether we have corrupted all similar tribes and whether the loss of our instinctial tribal ways is one of the biggest costs of a western society.

The cinematography resonates with the rawness of the film and you feel as if you are walking with them.

To then meet, at the end of the film, two of the children that are now grown up women is such a wonderful ending and such a poignant moment but is done in such a casual way.

To all those that have now lost their homes all around the world, you realise what a tragedy that really is. My heart goes out to them.

Watch this film, it is really beautiful.

1462273,5,B00005JLD4,"An affecting, deeply heartfelt film. If you're reading this, you probably guessed that already.

Here's something you might not guess from a quick glance at the DVD cover, though - or closer scrutiny, for that matter: a terrific behind-the-scenes documentary.

Rabbit-Proof Fence has a lot going for it - a richly compelling story, a sensational musical score by Peter Gabriel (in the vein of his Passion music from Last Temptation of Christ), a well-known director with a sure hand and a keen eye for detail, etc., etc.

When all is said and done, though, it all comes down to the kids' performances. One false note there, and the whole movie risks collapse.

I'm not a fan of DVD extras as a rule - I'm of the school that believes the thing should speak for itself.  Also, you and I can pick any number of DVDs that advertised fanta-bulous extras, only to deliver pallid 7-minute ""documentaries"" and thinly disguised commercial ads for the movie itself - ie. ""making-of"" featurettes that are actually thinly disguised theatrical trailers.

Well, the documentary on this DVD is a stunner - almost reason alone to buy the disc.

The 42-minute documentary - almost half the length of the feature itself -  focuses on Phillip Noyce's casting, vetting and eventual direction of the three kids in question.

Other reviewers have commented here about how striking 11-year-old Evelyn Sampi was in the pivotal role. What's remarkable about the documentary on this DVD is that you get to see exactly what was involved in bringing her out of her shell. It's a candid, affecting, honest portrayal, and Noyce comes across as a deeply humane, empathetic person, about as far removed from the cliche of the Hollywood tyrant as you can get. Sampi, for her part,  is clearly special - though, watching this, it's easy to worry about where she may go from here.

There's a telling moment in the documentary when Noyce, trying to life her spirits at a magazine photo shoot, says, ""You're going to be like Nicole Kidman"" (Noyce directed Kidman in her break-through role in Dead Calm, you may recall) and Sampi fires back, without missing a beat: ""Cathy Freeman."" (Cathy Freeman, as you may know, is Australia's world record holder and Olympic champion middle-distance runner, and a hero to her fellow aborigines.) The documentary also gives credit to the kids' acting coach, a trained aborigine actor and acting teacher, and it not only tells you about her but shows her working with the kids.

And let's hear it, too, for Kenneth Branagh, who was brave enough to play a real prick, without once trying to soften the edges. (One minor complaint: This is not Branagh's film; I suspect even he is embarassed to see his face dominate the DVD and movie poster's cover so much. There's a stunning image on the DVD menu of Sampi, braced against the wind, holding one of her younger siblings in her arms, the wind and dust playing across their faces: That would have made a much more striking cover. Oh, well, you know what they say: never judge a DVD by its cover. And never judge a movie by its poster.)

I thoroughly enjoyed Rabbit-Proof Fence.

I dreaded it at first, thinking it was going to be yet another one of those swallow-your-medicine TV movies-of -the-week. You know the ones: the ones with colons in their titles, that make you feel crummy just for being alive. But Noyce's humanity, his eye for human expressions and the deeply moving performances from the kids - all the kids - won me over.

The documentary is what makes this DVD special, though. (A minor caveat: the documentary, long as it is, focuses exclusively on the shaping of the kids' performances, so if you're looking for other background on the making of the film, or a documentary about the historical context in which the events unfolded, you won't find it here.)

If you appreciated this film as much as I did, do seriously consider getting this DVD. It doesn't have any of those fancy ""special edition"" or ""director's cut"" labels emblazoned on it, and the cover isn't really reperesentative of the movie inside, but it's special just the same.",1110585600,8,4101,4.787535410764873
1462274,5,B00005JLD4,"There can be little question that, were the shoe on the other foot --that is, if the government of the United States or England decided to take away the children of an entire demographic, say the children of southern whites or of people living in one of England's numerous rust belt ex-cities of the sort that seem to give ingrown rise to skinheads and white supremacists-- we would be reading some very different views from the racists on the topics explored in Rabbit Proof Fence. Can you imagine your neighbor's two kids being being carted away by the local sheriff without a fight? It wouldn't happen. Yet some people keep posting reviews that urge common, decent folk, like you and your neighbors, to support the sort of policy depicted by Rabbit Proof Fence. Incredible.

As bleak as Rabbit Proof Fence is at times, the story is, as many here have noted, really one of hope, of the triumph of the human spirit. It is a beautiful demonstration of resisting and overcoming gross social injustice. THAT'S the LESSON of this film. And besides being a great adventure trek story in it's own right, the film stands as a reminder: the only thing necessary for something like this to happen again -- to any race, any place, any moment-- is for the human capacity for empathy and seeing things FROM the other person's life-vantage to pass away without resistance. THAT'S why the voices of haters and racists deserve not censorship, but simply to be drowned out-- smothered completely-- by the voices of reasonable people who HAVEN'T lost their ability to empathise and identify and feel compassion for people who aren't exactly like them. To haters, empathy is a mystical process. They don't get it, and they hate it because it poses THE central threat to their ability to induct the disenfranchied and gullible into their intellectually and emotionally stunted army of the Got-It-All-Wrong.

This film is great, and the DVD contains some very fine supporting material,  in the form of the audio commentary and making-of documentary. It will make an absolutely superb addition to any  library or school DVD collection. Five stars+.",1109894400,3,2128,4.902777777777778

In this movie, however, the racism is portrayed as a ""gentle"" sort of racism where half caste girls are being isolated and educated for their own good, noblesse oblige at its finest (or at its worst).  One striking point in the movie was when the administrator shows a number of slides where aborigines become more and more white, as succeeding generations intermarry more and more with whites.

This was a very painful movie to watch.  I could imagine the three girls wondering what they did wrong to be taken from their homes and from their parents to what could only seem to them to be a prison.  The arrogance of the administrator was very difficult to watch also.  He seemed to believe the clichs that he was tossing about regarding the simplicity of these people, and their need to come under the white man's beneficence.  But in today's world he appears more like a slavemaster.

The aborigines are portrayed as slaves.  The tracker was obliged to stay at the camp or lose his daughter.  Girls were not allowed to speak when they ate, and would be placed alone in an exposed box for the least infraction, reminiscent of the torture box in Bridge on the River Kwai.

There is nothing uplifting in this movie, except for the determination of the girls to set a goal and follow it.  But in the end, their efforts were illusory. Don't expect any good or warm fuzzy feelings from this.  Instead, be prepared for a couple of hours of a very, very difficult and painful experience.",1105574400,2,1655,4.626712328767123
1462277,5,B00005JLD4,"Watching this movie about three girls removed from their home and sent to a camp that would train them into the ""white"" society reminds me of a book written by a mixed-raced African who was sent to an orphanage for mixed children.  The girls I believe were colonialism's ""accidents"".  The children who were mixed were ostracized by both Aborigines and whites because of their dual heritage.  The school was supposed to ""whiten"" them, which not only meant that they were to be trained as domestics, but to be lightened to make the country more white.

Colonialism and imperialism demoralized itself, trying to do right for the natives by forcibly imposing their culture on a people who already had a culture and a way of living.  The victims in the movie were the girls because of their racial makeup feared that they would be an imposed threat to society.

It is based upon a true story, which could mean the directors or authors opinion of the actual facts. To me, all movies are skewed, sometimes the director has to take an angle when the actual events are gray.  I felt this was a GREAT MOVIE. My daughters are 11,9 and 5. The five year thought it was a little boring in spots, but the 9 and 11 cried through much of the ending. They loved it. This is a wonderful movie to open up for discussions on civil rights, slavery, racism or the strength of family.  One could argue if Camp Moore was not a bad place for these three girls.  It looked like it was a pretty clean and and safe place, but ultimately it wasn't home. I recommend this movie, not as a depiction of history, but as good movie.

1462341,5,B00005JLD4,"In a time where movie producers are continuously trying to one-up each other with bigger-and-badder CGI spectacles, watching a film like this is refreshing. Completely stripped of pretension, prettiness, and unneccasary dribble, it is a story that speaks directly to the heart. Director Phillip Noyce (The Quiet American) and D.P. Christopher Doyle give us a vast and seemingly endless Australian desert landscape. In tune with the wonderfully placid score by Peter Gabriel, the results are hypnotic and compelling. There are stretches where very few lines of dialogue are spoken. The camera simply places these three young girls in the harshest reaches of the desert terrain, and we understand, if only slightly, what the real experience must have been like.

The film tells a simple story of what it means to feel secure as a child and be with family. It also explores the effects of an age old racial stereotype that was then policy of the Australian government; Blacks must integrate and adjust to white society. And worse, Blacks are not able to raise their own children. It works because it does not trap itself inside a fixed and conventional narrative. Noyce explores his themes well, without throwing them in our faces as so many films regrettably do. We as the viewers are immersed into the journey across 1,500 miles of unforgiving desert, as the young girls try to outmaneuver the men sent to recapture them.

This is a beautiful film in its ability to captivate and move us in unexpected ways. The last few shots show us the two surviving sisters, now old and weak, and we hear Molly in voice-over tell us how their family is still being ruined by racial prejudice. We sympathize with them, of course. But we notice they are smiling, unwavering in their optimism and love of life. They lost a sister on their journey back home, and Molly lost her daughter for good.

1462342,5,B00005JLD4,"Let me begin by saying this is a completely enthralling movie.  I wept at the plight of three little girls walking across Australia and dodging the evil Tracker who would take them back to captivity.  But the movie is not a true account in the sense of children being ripped from their mothers and locked away from their own society.  And the word ""genocide"" is thrown around capriciously and without regard to its meaning.

Genocide is the murder of a race of people.  The children who were relocated were fed, clothed, given an education and (horror of horrors) a Christian value base.  For anyone who would like to take the time and read the other side of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"", may I recommend an article by Keith Windschuttle which can be accessed at this web address:  [...]

Again, the movie itself is top drawer, but should in no way be considered a truthful history of the treatment of aborigines in the mid-20th century, nor should it ever be used for educational purposes as it is in error.",1100304000,2,1000,4.610169491525424
1462343,5,B00005JLD4,"This is a story that must be told again and again, from generation to generation.  In 1931, Australia, three aboriginal girls were taken away from their mothers, in order to be raised under the Christian educational system.  The most touching part of the story is, the three girls ran away from the institute, to walk back to their home, barefoot.  And the home was 1,500 miles away.

You may find the story is incredible, but what is told is true (you will see that before the end credit rolls).  Because of the government's law that attempted to 'save' the aboriganl children, the three girls, Molly, Gracie, and Daisy were captured by force while playing in their village, to be sent to the special institute where the new educational rules were set for the aboriginal children.

But Molly was not a girl to give up, so she and the two girls set out one of the hardest travels in the movie history -- to go back to their home, going 1,500 miles, barefoot.  The only guidance they could have was the rabbit proof fence (they made to prevent the imported rabbits from spreading westward), which would lead them to the destination.

But the governental officer in charge A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) soon starts to move.  An able tracker Moodoo follows thier route, reading the footprints on the ground.

Can the three girls go back to their home?  The film tells us the simple, but moving story with a skilled storytell's voice, without making it too dramatic nor too lean.  Actually, it is suspeceful when it wants to, but when it does, it does not lose its authenticity at all.

TWO GREAT POINTS about the film are its soundtrack music by Peter Gabriel, and the photography by Christopher Doyle.  The film together with their contributions unfolds like an epic against the marvelous backdrop of the nature in Australia.  And though three girls (all non-pro actors) are all convincing, it is Kenneth Branagh who really amazes us.  His character is a very believable one, a kind of person doing very atrocious things out of what he believes is pure good-will.  Branagh is very good when he does this sort of tricky job, as is seen in his portrayal of Nati officer in equally impressive 'The Conspirasy.'

DIRECTOR PHILIP NOYCE (himself from Australia) is probably known for his two Jack Ryan films, one so-so shocker 'Bone Collector' or several awful thrillers like 'Sliver' and 'The Saint.'  Forget about his past records.  He is a good director if given a right material, and now he shows it again.",1098316800,3,2503,4.736720554272518

During the Early 1900's the Australian government formed an organization that could declare parental rights over ""Caste"" aboriginal children. Their goal, a three generational breed-out of these lighter skinned children. In short, if they marry caucasions, and their own children do so, their grandchildren would be white. This would obliterate their race, a chilling notion that we have seen many times in history.

After scanning reviews for Rabbit Proof Fence, I found that Roger Ebert actually wept at the end of the film. It is definately moving, and the fact that he wept shouldn't necessarily make you conclude its a sad film. Despite the subject matter, the end result is an overwhelming story of strong will, and persistance.

1462349,5,B00005JLD4,"It seems that wherever racism exists a fence threatens to be built even to this day. This film is just another example of the world's great racial divide and brings to light the much ignored history of Aboriginal people.

Director Phillip Noyce has created a simple movie with a huge impact. He used real Aboriginal actors and managed to get a mountain of emotion out of the eyes of the three young girls that the movie centers around, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan. The story is based upon a true tale written by one of the central character's children. It begins happily with a beautiful family of Aborigines who exist in Australia during the 1930's, they live off the land in a peaceful existence until the white society decides that the ""black"" needs to be blended into the white race and eliminated, hints of Nazism invade here. Camps are set up and girls are captured to be trained and blended into the ""supreme"" white society without a care, almost as if they were merely cattle and not actual human beings.

The majority of the film is spent following the three girls through their escape from the camps and into the desert. It is adventurous, thrilling and often horribly sad. The girls encounter people along the way who see them as human and some help is offered through crusts of bread and warm coats. They follow a fence line to find their way back home and end up traveling for nine weeks and over about 1,500 miles. The ending is beautifully touching and well worth the adventure.

I learned something new from this film. I was never aware of what white society tried to do to the Aborigines, yet another horrid aspect of racism not taught in average schools. It seems that Australia committed atrocities towards the Aborigines well through the 1970's and possibly even to this day to some extent. While I am constantly disappointed by humanity and its constant desire to separate the races I was not disappointed in this film. It is a beautiful and heroic saga about the human spirit and the struggle for personal freedom. Let this fence topple all others with its important message.",1091923200,,2119,4.706199460916442
1462350,5,B00005JLD4,"I will forever be grateful to Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper for having reviewed their film on their TV show.  Indeed, that's how I heard of it and immediately placed it on my list of must-see films.

It's a heart rending film, at least to human beings with compassion.  I had heard from Australian friends that, historically, Australia had treated Aborigines as badly as the United States had treated American Indians, but I knew none of the specifics.

Rabbit-Proof Fence, based on the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence by Doris Pilkington Garimara, gives its audience an insight into a blatantly racist policy in place in Australia from the early 1930's through the beginning of the 1970's.  Here, we learn of three ""half-caste"" Aboriginal girls, sisters Molly and Daisy and their first cousin Grace, whose biological fathers are white and whose mothers are Aborigines.  Empowered by the Aborigines Regulation of 1931, the government systematically arrested children of mixed race and removed them from their parents, transporting them huge distances to boarding schools that differed little from concentration camps.  There, the children were forced to speak English only and educated to become domestic servants to be placed with white people.  The program's purpose was to prevent them from having children with aboriginal spouses.  Children who ran away from the camps were hunted down, brought back, put in solitary confinement and beaten severely.

In the instant story, the three children, miserable in their new surroundings at 14, 12 and 8 years old, escape despite the possible consequences and walk home, a distance of 1,500 miles.  Australia had constructed a system of rabbit-proof fences, designed to keep the burgeoning rabbit population (a species introduced from Europe with no natural enemies in Australia) from further invading farmlands.  The girls know that the rabbit-proof fence goes through their home settlement and stretches for thousands of miles, so they follow it.

The film gives us a look at their journey and as they progress over nine weeks.

Australian filmmaker Philip Noyce has done an outstanding job.  This story requires no complicated treatment and none is given.  It all looks very real and Noyce did an outstanding job locating the three Aborigine girls who play Molly, Grace and Daisy.  By the way, it's Molly's daughter who wrote the book Follow the Rabbit Proof Fence based on her mother's own story.

We Americans should be able to appreciate this film given our own history with regard to our aboriginal people, the American Indians.  We need to know this story because we need to take a stand that such things should never again be allowed to happen.",1090886400,2,2702,5.14187643020595

1462479,5,B00005JLD4,"Set in Australia's bleak outback, this 2002 film takes place in 1931, when white bureaucrats forced their own morality on aboriginal half-castes living in the bush.  Believing that these half-white children ""deserved"" the ""advantages"" of ""civilization,"" and convinced that in three generations their blackness could be ""bred out,"" the Australian government forcibly removed them from their families, brought them to settlements hundreds of miles from their homes, and trained them to be domestic servants.  Forty years later the government finally abandoned the policy, leaving a ""Stolen Generation"" in its wake.  Molly Craig has long been the symbol of the Aborigines' refusal to accept this genocidal policy, and this film, brilliantly directed by Philip Noyce, celebrates her unconquerable spirit in the face of sanctioned governmental cruelty.
Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), her cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan), and her sister (Tianna Sansbury), aged thirteen to eight, are cruelly removed from their mothers in Jigalong (Western Territories) and taken a thousand miles to the Moore River Native Settlement, which is directed by the self-righteous Mr. Neville (convincingly played by Kenneth Branagh), who believes in the inherent correctness of the resettlement policy.  Placed in overcrowded dormitories, prohibited from using their own language, and required to live according to another world's rules, Molly, her sister, and her cousin decide to escape by following the 1500-mile ""rabbit-proof fence,"" which borders both the settlement and their distant home.  They must avoid detection by a hired Aborigine tracker (played menacingly by David Gulpilil) and by government workers and white settlers.  For nine grueling weeks, the girls live virtually on their own, surviving through their ancestral knowledge of the land.
Written by Molly Craig's daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara, who, later, was also removed from her mother Molly and forced to live in a settlement, the film is a moving celebration of the human spirit, a tribute to Molly Craig, and a plea to acknowledge the rights of aboriginal peoples, wherever they may live.  The harsh and unforgiving land is beautifully photographed, and the haunting music of aboriginal voices and instruments in the Golden Globe-nominated score by Peter Gabriel further the realism.  The cast of young girls, all making their film debuts, never makes a misstep, conveying the trauma of their separation, their commitment to returning home, and, in Sampi's case, an anger which is only barely hidden.  Branagh, though effective, really does not have to do much to be the villain here.  In this beautifully realized depiction of a wrong-headed policy, director Noyce wisely chooses not to embellish the message with unnecessary, artificial melodrama--reality here is drama enough.

1462480,5,B00005JLD4,"I was aware that the treatment of the Aborigines by those that settled Australia was fairly consistent with that of all European settlers dealing with indigenous people when ""colonizing"" someone else's land.  I specifically recall how during the 2000 Sydney Olympics much was made of the symbolism of Cathy Freeman, an Aborigine on the Australian Olympic team, lighting the Olympic torch.  Even more was made of the symbolism when Freeman went on to win the gold medal in the 400 meter.  But I have to admit that when it comes to Australian films I tend to think in terms of ""Breaker Morant"" and ""Gallipoli,"" where the point was how the British Empire was treating the Australian citizens of the Commonwealth as if nothing had changed since the first convicts were sent from Britain Down Under.  Still, to see Australians turn around and treat others even more inhumanely was rather something of a shock.
""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is the story of three young Aborigine girls who escaped from a government camp in 1931 and tried to walk home 1,500 miles.  Molly (Everlyn Sampi), her sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan) were taken from their mothers because they are half-castes, their white fathers long gone after constructing the rabbit-proof fence which saves Australia's farm land from being devoured.  The fence, of course, is both a metaphor for the separation of the children from their families as well as the touchstone that can help the girls get home.
The reason the girls are removed is because of the edict of A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh), who was the administrator in charge of Aborigines in Western Australia.  As portrayed in the film Neville is concerned about the creation of a third race and has the idea that with the proper breeding within three generations the half-castes will look white.  Now there is conflicting historical evidence on how Aborigine children ended up at the Moore River Native Settlement pertaining to half-castes being ostracized by pure bloods and Aborigine parents wanted their children to receive an education.  But in ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" the reasons are clearly to ""save"" these children from themselves, and there is an implication the education is so these children can be domestic servants for white families.
Even if you did not see Branagh in ""Conspiracy,"" the TV movie where he played SS-Obergruppenfhrer Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office, and chief architect of the ""Final Solution"" at the Wannsee Conference the parallels are unmistakable between Neville's theory of eugenics and the Nazis.  But once Molly leads the other two girls into the outback Neville is not as important to the chase as Modoo (David Gulpilil), the native tracker who is required to enforce the policies that are resulting in ""The Lost Generation"" of his people.  If this is a film that wants to see the world only in terms of black or white, there is no doubt which side wins your sympathy.
Having made big budget Hollywood films like ""Patriot Games,"" ""Clear and Present Danger"" and ""The Bone Collector,"" director Phillip Noyes provides a more intimate film like he did back in 1977 with ""Backroads.""  His three stars are a trio of first time actresses, selected (as he explains in the accompanying featurette) so that everybody in the world who say them would want to adopt them.  But they also turn out to act and Sampi as Molly Craig is at least as good as Keisha Castle-Hughes was in ""Whale Rider.""
This is a true story and as such you know not to expect a happy ending, but that does not stop your from harboring such hopes as the three girls continue on their journey and the authorities try to stop them before they reach their home and their families.  As a true story there will be the obligatory title cards at the end telling you the rest of the story and explaining how the practice of separating half-castes from their parents continued until 1970, which may well be a more depressing thought than anything engendered by the film.  But be forewarned that the most devastating scene on the DVD is not in the film when the girls are taken away from their wailing mothers, but in the featurette when we see what happens to the cast and crew after they finish filming that scene.
Special note needs to be made of the commentary track provided by director Phillip Noyce and featuring musician Peter Gabriel, actor Kenneth Branagh, screenwriter Chiristine Olsen and author Pilkington Garimara.  This is not a track where everybody is in the room at once talking about the film.  Instead this is mostly Noyce talking about the film, totally independent of what is on the screen, and when he talks about one of the other principles we get to hear their thoughts on the process of turning the original book and the story it was based on into this film.  This is usually the sort of deep thoughts you get from a film critic doing the commentary on a Criterion Edition of a classic film, so finding it on this 2002 drama is a nice bonus.",1088467200,6,5019,4.823050058207218

1462584,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is a remarkable story of brutal racism and the courage of three children.  Until as recently as 1970, Australia's harsh policy toward its aboriginal people allowed for the forcible capture of half-white children and their relocation in concentration-camp-like centers, for the purpose of training them to be domestic servants in white society.  This film tells the true story of three such girls who escaped from the center in 1932, and walked 1500 miles back to their family.  Their only marker, across the desolate desert and bush, was the world's longest fence, the ""rabbit-proof fence,"" which eventually led them home.

This story of Australia's misguided attempt to help the aborigines ""in spite of themselves"" has an excellent script and direction.  The children, all non-actors, are wonderfully convincing and sympathetic.  Kenneth Branagh has a small role as the government official who tries to recapture the girls.  He is a by-the-books, no-nonsense man who believes he is really helping the people whose lives he decimates.  David Gulpilil plays the aboriginal tracker who relentlessly follows the girls, and his villainous character was truly frightening.  The sweeping photography of the arid outback shows just how tremendous the girls' accomplishment was.  Rabbit-Proof Fence is a very sad but important story and I heartily recommend it.",1081209600,,1372,5.459715639810427

1462705,5,B00005JLD4,"In 1931, when this story occurs, Molly (Everlyn Sampi), is 14 years old, Daisy (Tianna Sansbury), is eight, and their cousin, Gracie (Laura Monaghan) is ten. At the time the Australian government is separating 'half-caste' Aborigine children from their 'degenerate' Aborigine mothers. All three girls are the daughters of an Aborigine mother and a white father, and are living in the small town of Jigalong.
This forced separation is determined by the Australian Chief Protector of Aborigines, Mr Neville (Brannagh), who is compelled to save the children from their selves and exposed to the 'wonders and benefits' of white society and culture. The plan is to train these 'half-caste' children to be the domestic help for the white society, and to ultimately breed the Aborigine out of them. It is the 'Good And Christian Thing' to do.
Ripped from their mothers, grandmother and auntie, they are taken to More River, twelve hundred miles away, a psuedo-orphanage, although 'concentration camp' is a term that also fits. Days or hours before they are snatched, a local tells Molly about the 1500 mile fence erected by the Australian government. The fence splits the country in two, erected to keep rodent rabbits out of arable farming land, and you can almost see Molly filing away the information in her head.
After they arrive at More River, realising that they must forget their mother's language and culture, to take on a life of duty and responsibility like all 'good Christian' girls, Molly does a brave and desperate thing. She grabs her sister and cousin and takes off, heading into the general direction of Jigalong, sending the 'Chief Protector' and the 'law' into a frenzy of searching.
Molly's will and the authority with which she takes up her task, provides a steel and grit required to broach the wilderness alone and unprotected. Her indomitable spirit brings all that make us human into sharp focus. She will not consent to being held, or separated from her mother and family, and she will not give up.
That this story occurs against a political backdrop, allows us to juxtapose the aridity of the Australian landscape, with Molly's own journey. However, this is an internal journey for Molly, as much as an external one. Remembering and finding the rabbit proof fence, she finds it and follows it for hundreds and hundreds of miles; home is somewhere along the fence. For Molly, it is the only guide she has in the wilderness.
Exhorting her younger charges, she dodges and eludes the skilled Aborigine tracker, Moodoo, and the Australian law enforcement, with wit and tenacity for the two months of the trip. She loses her cousin Gracie to betrayal and capture in the process; but pushes on, often carrying Daisy and living off what little the land provided.
In ""Rabbit Proof Fence"", we watch and find guts to face simple challenges, in the struggle of Molly, Daisy and Gracie to face almost insurmountable challenges. That a story of courage like this one, could and does do that, should not surprise; a well told, well made story is <strong>meant</strong> to do that. That it is a true story, based on the book, ""Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" by Doris Pilkington, Molly's daughter, strikes even closer to the heart.
Although it's a story told in few words, the three extraordinarily photogenic faces of the first-time actresses are haunting, long after the fade to black. Their portrayals are entirely believable and engaging. Brannagh, as the chillingly misguided Chief Protector, displays the arrogance of European colonial perceptions of superiority with skill. Gulpilil as Moodoo who although has not and will not stop seeking the girls, almost cheers whenever clever little Molly eludes him. Sampi's indefatigable Molly, never exhibits defeat only defiance and determination. All three girls are excellent, turning in performances untouched by guile or affectation.
Molly's mother, played by Ningali Lawford, oozes the longing for her children with her constant watching along the line of the fence with no words, just her eyes. In a scene where she confronts the law enforcement officer who took her children away, the strength of a mother's anger is powerful and palpable, although again, no words are spoken in the scene.
Peter Gabriel's soundtrack, made from adapted traditional Aboriginal music, is so haunting, as to take on it's own character in the film. The cinematography captures the sprawling Australian wilderness without overwhelming the image of these three tiny girls, walking, walking, walking....
The film allows us a view of the subtle and overt cruelty that European colonisation and racism creates, and the dogged pursuance of questionable values. The Aborigines in the story are subhuman to the colonists; as such, there is no wrong doing in their inhumanity. In fact, Mr Neville so convinces himself and his supporters of this policy, that the abduction and 're-education' of 'half-caste' children went on until the 1970s.
The Australian government created what has been subsequently called, the ""Stolen Generations"" among the Aborigine population. The Aborigines still suffer the effects of the child stealing. Many of their children, lost to the white world, have never returned home.
The film is impressive in every way; touching chords within the soul, and taking us on that internal journey that humanity faces when the inhumanity of ourselves turns back on itself. It's important because it tells the story of the suffering of the Aborigines in Australia, and exposes the hidden genocide against them. The sadness of the tale, enrages the heart of the conscious against the ignorance and self absorption of European colonisers, and the callousness with which they treat other cultures and races. It also, for this writer at least, allows one to remember the similar suffering still going on today.
This story's strength is not in it's angry portrayal of injustice, but in the gritty determination of the girls not to become victims to the racist policies of invaders and usurpers. We find definitive resistance and ultimately the victory of the human heart.",1079136000,4,6111,5.130391173520562

It must have been a very unforgiving environment to work in; there is nothing pretty about the topography of western Australia. In fact, it reminds me a lot of western Oklahoma! Token A-list actor Kenneth Branaugh did his job well; he really had me believing that he really was a despicable, pompous bastard who actuallythought he was doing right by these native families.
The music during the end credits is gorgeous, haunting, evocative -- this from the man who gave us Sledgehammer and dancing fryers! I was grateful for my stereo TV and headphones as I found myself replaying the end credits repeatedly, and you can bet I'll keep an eye out for the soundtrack.
As usual, the DVD extras make a good package that much better. Having the voiceover of the director, screenwriter and cast members enhanced the viewing experience, but I do wish they would consider parallel captioning for the audio presentation. It's not fair that the hearing-impaired would miss this information, but even those of us with perfect hearing who may not be well versed in Australian dialect would benefit from it.

1462709,5,B00005JLD4,"Philip Noyce has transformed an epic journey into an example of visual poetry.  Three girls, kidnapped and destined for ""assimilation"" into white Australian society, escape their ""protectors"".  In an astonishing journey, pursued by government police and an Aborigine tracker, they evade authority's clutches.  After seven weeks and eighteen hundred kilometres journey, they reach home.  Perhaps the longest foot journey in Australia.
Noyce beautifully captures the harsh environment traversed by the trio, even though the filming was far distant from the actual location.  The girls must use every available cover and device to escape capture, and Noyce maintains the tension throughout the film.  Using numerous close-ups to convey feeling, you're kept aware that flight from captivity isn't a social event.  Encounters with either white or fellow Aborigines force reserve, suspicion and hesitation - talk is minimised, even among the three escapees.  This is a highly visual film in a setting providing oppotunities for lush images.
It is the people, however, that give this film its true grandeur.  Clearly, the fleeing girls aren't professionals before the camera.  Everlyn Sampi's facial expressions seize the soul in nearly every scene.  She's aware of the burden she's carrying, leading the escape, keeping them free, thwarting detection and pursuit, finding the track.  David Gulpilil, the Aborigine tracker, also rivets the eye as he leads the quest to return the girls to the mission.  How does he feel in pursuit of his own kind in the employ of the dominant, racist, white society?  Kenneth Branagh might have absorbed the soul of A.O. Neville so graphically does he portray the ""Protector of Aborigines"".  Called ""The Devil"" by Aborigines and seeming to personify all the worst aspects of a racist society, Neville was simply an extreme example of his society's mores.  Branagh clearly understands this fully, playing the role with marvelous reserve.

This DVD is almost a novelty for other aspects.  The discriminating viewer will soon discover that the ""Special Features"" aren't something to by-pass lightly.  Instead of the usual long-winded interviews with directors, producers and actors, Noyce, with his usual skill offers something truly captivating.  He takes you on a ""hand-held camera"" journey to solicit the acting team from remote Australian communities.  We are introduced to the various children discovered, assessed and chosen for the roles.  These are but children suddenly confronted with a new world.  Their reactions are poignant and inspiring.

Finally, the viewer will discover yet another level of reward in watching the film again with the voice-over commentary enabled.  Fresh surprises await the patient as Noyce discusses how the film came to him and his enthusiasm for it.  He relates his dealings with all the cast.  It is David Gulpilil who, with infinite subtlety, transforms the book's tracker into a wholly new and realistic character.  Every praise that can be imparted to the three children suddenly becomes remote as you discover Gulpilil manifests the two centuries of Aborigine-white encounters.  Buy this film in anticipation of many unexpected revelations. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1076371200,5,3245,5.44689378757515

The three girls -- Molly, Daisy and Gracie -- are sent 1,200 miles from their home in Jigalong to a school for children such as themselves, half-aborigine, half-white.  the camp strives to assimilate the children into the white culture through such things as church and disallowing the use of their native language.  Molly is determined, though, to make it back to her mother, and on a day threatening rain, she, Gracie and Daisy escape from the school.  The only way to make it back to Jigalong is to walk the 1200 miles along the rabbit-proof fence that stretches the entire length of Australia.
This film tells the true story of the girls' trek across Australia through such dangers as hunger, thirst, the desert and an aboriginal tracker who is just as determined to re-capture them.  With stunning cinematography, a fine script and marvelous direction from Phillip Noyce, the viewer is drawn into this harrowing story.  Peter Gabriel's score suits the setting and subtles acts to enrich the emotional impact of the film.  The acting is equally good with Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville who earns the nickname ""Devil"" and David Gulpilil as the aboriginal tracker.  the best performances, though, come from the three young girls: Tianna Sansbury as Daisy, the youngest; Laura Monaghan as Gracie, who forces herself to escape with Molly; and Everlyn Sampi as Molly, the head-strong young girl determined to let nothing stop them from returing home.

My only concern is that with all other review that i have read thus far, it seems that of the American reviewers completely understand the ""stolen generation"" situation. i found it rather odd particularly from one reviewer from seattle, saying that neither side was completely right, unless you consider sleeping int he dirt, eating lizards and bugs, and no ""proper"" education Right. Saying this is exactly what the movie was showing. that THe ""WHite"" Australians where trying to assimilate the Native aborigionies to be ""White Australians"". Basically trying to remove there customs, beliefs, and way of life. Eating bugs, lizards, kangaroo's, berries is traditional bush tucker. sleeping in the dirt with leaves as a mattress is what they did. It is the Indigenous Australian way of life. The film was showing an event which happened in Australia's past, and how while the ""White Australians"" might not have been completely wrong, as they did have the native Australians interests at heart, they where simply trying to do what they thought was right with their view of that era.
whilst the stolen generation incident happened 74 years ago, it is still an event which is still in the political headlines. THis film allows us as Australians, reflect on this incident, and look forward to the future and learn from our predicesors mistakes.",1074038400,9,1472,5.036885245901639

1462714,4,B00005JLD4,"In Brief
This is the true story of three of the members of the Stolen Generation.  Molly Craig, a young Aboriginal Girl played by Everlyn Sampi leads her younger sister and cousin in an escape from a government institution, set up as part of a policy to train Aboriginal children as domestic workers and integrate them into white society, where if they are suitable candidates some were chosen have their colour bred out.  Escaping this camp where ethnic cleansing has a far happier face on its front than the one that was in Europe at that time, she takes her companions on a journey of 1,500 miles.  An epic story that sees Molly one step ahead of the authorities at every turn, as she uses the rabbit proof fence that bisects the continent in this incredible journey home.
Review
The strength of Rabbit Proof Fence comes through its ability to be both educational in its lessons of hidden history while at the same time reinforcing the human spirit and pathos that one can never loose hope under even the most extreme circumstances.
The mood of the film is conveyed perfectly through the performance given by Everlyn Sampi, who was discovered after a national talent search on the Australian channel nine.  Her simple gestures and the power held within her eyes, as she leads her sisters on a journey of extremes is both a testament to herself and director Phillip Noyce.
Noyce, a veteran of hits such as Clear and Present Danger and The Bone Collector, has had a successful career ""blowing stuff up in the sandpit that is Hollywood"" as he put it, though he has never really become a household name outside of his domestic Australian homeland.  This month the unsung helmer brings us two films: accompanying this is The Quiet American.  Needless to say Fence has his heart while the other satisfies his pocket.  Fence is a personal horror story for all Australians that until now has gone untold.  It brings to life Doris Pilkington's original novel that tells the story of her mother's courageous journey home.  The fence, while having its practical uses in stopping the rabbit population from ravaging crops, acts as a metaphor to us all:  For Molly it was the umbilical cord that allowed her to find her mother and her home, while on a secondary level it is showing the rest of the world the way to the truth - and through its symbolic status after the films release has reunited members of the stolen generation.
The most successful film in Australia last year, it has already been nominated for 10 AFI awards and depending upon its marketing in the States, deserves worldwide recognition.  If ever a child star deserved an Oscar then Everlyn Sampi is a top candidate in my mind.  The only major downside to this film is that it has an odd pace and does occasionally feel likes its natural tempo is disrupted in order to give the narrative a kick start it doesn't need.  Maybe too many years in Hollywood are responsible, but one can't help but feel that this is a director at odds with his own styles:  A question of how much gloss does one use before the reality can no longer breath springs to mind!
The Verdict
This is a beautiful film that is both mesmerising and finely acted.  If only it were slightly grittier, relying less on creating a point of view experience and had let the story speak for itself it would have been perfect.",1073433600,6,3344,4.634517766497462

1462855,3,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit Proof Fence is about three young Abrogine (the native people of Austrilia) girls living in Austrilia.  The goverenment takes them away from their parents to have them raised as ""civilied"" white people.  Unhappy in the camp they are sent to, the girls escape, outsmarting all of the trackers following them.  Their road to cross the 1200 miles of Australian Outback was a fence to keep rabbits from destroying farmland.  Through all of their adventures, they eventually made it home.  This was based on a true story.

The story was okay.  The only problem was that the movie dragged out and seemed to go on forever.  I was very suprized that it was only 90 minutes long.  The director used cool camera angles, but they got kind of annoying after a while.  The soundtrack was composed by Peter Gabriel, and it was just plain scary.  It was mostly buzzing noises of bugs, and more often than not, drowned out the dialog that was going on.

The best part of the DVD in my opinion was the documentary about the making of the movie.  It had the director talking about the movie, along with other actors in it, and I found it much more interesting than the movie itself.

I would reccomend this to anyone trying to learn about history, but anyone else would love to sleep through the movie!",1072396800,,1290,4.576419213973799
1462856,5,B00005JLD4,"I could not agree less with the previous reviewer's opinion of this film...  Rabbit-Proof Fence is the certainly the best Australian film I have ever seen and one of the finest films yet from this young decade.  Why?  It's story is real, poignant, and thoroughly entertaining; I never once looked at the clock.  And its heart-tugging without being sappy or overly politically correct; like the Quebecois film ""Robe Noir"", one sees that neither side is completely in the right (unless you think its OK to sleep in the dirt, eat lizards, and have no formal education).  The film is visually stunning with brilliant colors and superb wide screen cinematography.  And the acting, in my humble opinion, puts this film over the top.  Kenneth Brannaugh redeems his downwardly spiraling career with a performance that will some day be held up just underneath his Henry V as his most compelling role.  But even more importantly, Everlyn Sampi's quiet but powerful performance should someday be held up with Maria Falconetti's Jeanne d'Arc as one of the most memorable events in the history of film.  She was stunning.  David Gulpilil's role as the tracker was also great.  It gave that ""uuuuuuu"" scary feel that I remember from reading Mark Twain novels as a kid.  All of this makes for a great family-film introduction to serious topics.
I thought the DVD image and the ""making of"" extra documentary were thoroughly entertaining.  I was also fascinated with how beautiful all those young Aboriginal children were.  In all my life I have never scene an attractive Aboriginal person on TV or film, and here I see that there are bounds of them.  This film was largely ignored by the US market and awards, but that means little.  A look at the long list of best-picture winning Oscars shows a long line of mostly forgotten and unimportant films.  Time will tell if Rabbit-Proof Fence becomes a great classic, but my overwhelming inclination is that it will indeed.",1071446400,,1952,4.8844984802431615
1462857,3,B00005JLD4,"I've read a large number of glowing reviews of this film - and I don't necessarily disagree - it's a very good movie - well structured, beautifully shot, etc.
But I'm going to be brave here and say the unspeakable - this is a boring flick.  No matter how heartfelt and important the content of this film is or how true and fully realized are the protagonist's epic journey, these young girls just _don't say anything_(!).  A good subtitle would have been ""Mimes Across the Desert"" (ha ha ha... heh)
These girls never come to life for me - they have no opinions about anything, no distinct personalities, no inner life.  The audience can empathize and project themselves into these runaways, so the film does work - but this film could have been so much more if only it had an additional 5-10 minutes of dialogue.
The commentary however, is very interesting and informative of the whole process. Mr. Noyce shares with us his irritation with Hollywood and takes a verbal stab at Harrison Ford.  Unintentionally funny stuff.",1071273600,,1021,4.719101123595506

1462859,4,B00005JLD4,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" provides a thrilling adventure tale, a fascinating historical document, and a stirring tribute to the strength and resiliency of the human spirit - all for the price of a single admission ticket (or rental fee).
This true-life story is a classic case of racist imperialism run amuck.  As late as 1970, the white government in Australia believed it had solved the ""problem"" of what to do with all the half-caste children populating the country (a half-caste is the product of one parent who is white and the other aborigine).  The solution the leaders came up with was to simply take the children away from their parents, move the youngsters into government-run ""schools,"" then ""ease"" their way into the white population and culture.  The hope was that, through education and interbreeding, the aborigines would eventually be subsumed completely by the white race.  The most maddening and amazing aspect of this story is the fact that many of the people in charge of this policy genuinely believed that what they were doing was right, that they were actually enlightening the aborigines, improving their lot in life and rescuing them from a life of stone-aged hardship and ignorance - if only the natives could be made to see it for themselves!  It didn't seem to matter to these authorities that, in their efforts, they were violating the very foundation upon which civilized society is based: the sacred bond of the family.  Yet through the outrage of those characters who refuse to give into this notion, the film taps into that desire common to each and every one of us:  to be who we are and not what other people think we should be.
The story takes place in 1931 when three young girls are ripped away from their homes and families and placed into a ""training camp"" run by the government.  Molly is the oldest of the three, a sensitive but fiery girl of twelve who decides to break out of their prison and lead her cousin and little sister across 1500 miles of scorching desert back to their native home.  Young Everlyn Sampi gives a stunning performance as Molly, a wide-eyed youngster driven by strength and determination to rescue the three of them from this gross miscarriage of justice.  Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan do an equally beautiful job as her erstwhile mates who face a task far more daunting than most of us will ever have to confront.  Kenneth Branagh, in a relatively small but pivotal role as the government official in charge of all the nation's half-castes, manages to bring a touch of humanity to a character who could easily have slipped over into unmitigated villainy in the wrong actor's hands.  In a strange way, Branagh makes us see this character less as an odious creature and more as a misguided product of his culture, upbringing and time.
Featuring expert direction by Philip Noyce and haunting music by Peter Gabriel, ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" serves the same kind of salutary purpose for the present day Australians that a movie like ""One Potato, Two Potato"" (also about the problems faced by mixed race children) did for Americans in the 1960's.  ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" provides Aussies with a chance to confront and repudiate a disreputable chapter in their recent past - something movies have proven very effective at doing in many different parts of the world.",1069545600,2,3322,4.879218472468916
1462860,5,B00005JLD4,"This movie is a movie that should teach people how to make movies. I can't figure out how to briefly sum it up but here it goes. I sat down to watch this movie and as I do any other but I couldn't move from my seat, all my senses were heightened. I forgot about  everything around me I was engulfed in this movie!",1069113600,3,313,3.890625
1462861,5,B00005JLD4,"The book is a straightforward telling of the story of the 3 girls walk, almost 2000 KM in about 9 weeks, eluding the police and obtaining food. Interestingly it starts with the first European's landing on the shores and the ancestors of the girls reactions. The reviews at amazon give a sufficient outline of the movie and i don't feel the need to repeat the details here.
What i would like to discuss is the clash of cultures that underlies and animates the movie. The key scene in the policeman holding up the paper and removing the children from their mother's loving arms, to be placed in a heartless, cruel, impersonal, prison. Western culture several hundred years ago became structured, institutionalized, bureaucratic, impersonal. The aboriginal culture, for at least 60thousand years has remained close to the foundations of humanity: hunter-gatherers, minimal technology, minimal possessions. The words of the superintendent: ""Just because they use Neolithic tools doesn't mean that they have Neolithic brains."" is the key element in this 'clash of cultures'. The conquest of Australia, like the destruction of native cultures in the Pacific and the Americas was done via germs and guns, (to partly quote an excellent book on the topic). It was the difference in the tools, in the things of these two different cultures that doomed the Aboriginals to the destruction of their long held way of life, not the ideas, not the humanity(or lack of it) of either group. And this is, to me, one of the paradoxes of the movie. The motivations of the institutionalizers was clearly not evil as much as wrongly directed. Yet the obvious evil that emerged from it must be explained not only as a result of massive impersonal institutions creating their own inertia, but in the deflection of human personalities, of human feelings in those institutions towards the goals of those institutions. Simply put, our tools shape their own results, despite our personal feelings or conscious intentions. That is even before the observation that people assume the fascade of their organizations, even before we realize that people are shaped and controlled by their institutions and their tools.
So it is a story that starkly illustrates the collision of cultures in the type of tools each has purchased with the souls of the people inside. For despite the intentions and outspoken feelings of the white people involved they continued the brutal suppression and destruction of the Aboriginal culture and people through the heart-wrenching tearing away of their next generation. The movie and the book are on a very personal level, just one old lady relating what happened to her so many years ago, to us her audience. Yet even in this personal level the tools intervene, for the way home, the bread crumbs, the yellow brick road was the rabbit proof fence.
European culture introduced the rabbits to Australia, to the extraordinary destruction of the native habitat and unique animals that exist there. All to create more rabbits at the destruction of the kangaroos, analogous to the western peoples invasion which substituted white human bodies for black. The rabbit proof fence was a typical western ideological tool to try to fix what never should have happened. More technology chasing the problems of more stupid decisions, round and round until the destructiveness of the whole package is obvious to even the meanest minded colonist. The fence never worked, the rabbits got through, technology failed, again. But the fence became a very specific thing in the minds of the Aboriginals, it was the way to come out of the wilderness where they lived their ancestrial ways and became the hangers-on of the white tool based culture. For the fence was the boundary between white and Aboriginal, between the hunter gatherer and the stationary monthly ration outback ranch way of life. And to the girls it was the way home.
The movie, like the destruction of native cultures, is full of paradoxes like these. The powerlessness of young girls arraided against the full brute force of the police and their legal papers, the fact that they are 'half-caste' who grew up hated by the full aboriginal kids, then torn from that by their father's culture who only wanted to turn them into domestic slaves. We cheer for the girls, we distaint the Aboriginal tracker who deserts his own people for the service of the conquerers, we cry with the mothers as they strike their heads with rocks to mourn their children's kidnapping. But we might miss the big picture if we look at them as the only victims of the system, for the huge imposing edifice of Western police, military, courts, governments is just the iceberg-like tip of a culture that imposed tools between people, which dehumanizes and manipulates its inhabitants into believing that theirs is the best of all possible ways of living. This is the big picture, the Aboriginal way of life, the culture as a testimony that humanity has not always lived this way, that it is not necessarily the only way to express our common humanity, that there were alternatives in the recent past. Before the machine destroyed them all.",1068854400,,5154,4.994186046511628
1462862,5,B00005JLD4,"The story, set in 1931, is of three young Aboriginal girls in Australia who are ""half castes,"" --the offspring of an aboriginal mother and white father.

The amazing part of the tale comes shortly after they arrive at the facility. They escape into the outback, and over the course of a couple of months, walk back to their village of Jingaloo and their families, using the 'rabbit-proof fence' as a guide.

It's hard not to feel for the protagonist, Molly, and her family as we trek through the Australian Outback with her. Sometimes we forget that movies can work without all the billion dollar FX and ego driven super-celeb stars. Very well directed and believably acted by all.
Yet, the sentimentality is a bit over-cooked. One cannot trivialize the issues the film tackles, but can wonder why the emotion had to be laid on so thickly. I had the impression they were resorting to ""tug-at-the-heartstrings"" stuff because they were afraid the film wouldn't stand up without it.

1462981,4,B00005JLD4,"In the 1930s the Australian government, after years of brutality against the Aborigines, decided to try another tactic -- the inculcation of the indigenous people into the superior English tradition -- thus proving that the only thing worse than hostility is kindly ignorance.  Believing that all traces of their 'inferiority' could be washed away after three generations of breeding with the conquering bloodline, officials began rounding up half-castes, separating them from their families, and raising them in indoctrination camps.  This is the story of three little girls who ran away, following the longest fence in the world back toward their home and their mothers.  The three young girls do a fine job in these demanding roles, though sometimes it's difficult to hear the spoken lines.  The supporting cast is uniformly good, the settings are quite dramatic, and the film, while not touching on some of the more disturbing aspects of this government plan (who were these kids supposed to mate with, for example), does leave you grateful that some things have changed in the past century, even if it's not enough.

Neville, Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The film depicts three young girls, who after being removed from their mother to a training school 1,500 miles away, escape and make the long journey back, helped by a long fence used to protect farmland from the ravages of Australia's rabbit population.  The film is solidly based on fact, drawing from a book written by the lone surviving daughter of one of the three girls. Despite contemporary sensibilities to this grim policy once viewed as one of enlightened benevolence, the movie itself is not heavy-handed in moralistic overtones, but rather focuses on the ingenuity of the three girls in eluding their Aboriginal tracker (skillfully played by David Gulpilil). In an extraordinarily powerful climax, we actually see cameo appearances by two of three survivors of this epic journey at the end of the movie, seventy years after their feat in the Western Australian outback.

1462983,5,B00005JLD4,"This raw adaptation of a true story about one of Australia's more shameful historical periods is exquisite, to say the least. The account of Molly, Gracie, and Daisy would be over-the-top, if one did not realize that this was indeed a true story. In an effort to ""purify"" races and gradually eliminate the continent's aboriginal peoples (all under the guise of ""bettering their prospects"" -- yeah, right), a white organization ludicrously created for the ""Protection"" of natives ends up destroying lives, families, and an entire culture with the kind of systematic fervor and idiocy that can only emanate from racist bureacracies. The three children in question are brutally taken from their bush-dwelling mother to be ""re-programmed"" at a filthy outback concentration camp run by white-clad nun-types who force the children to sing English American Slave plantation songs. The girls escape and, led by the clever Molly, journey hundreds of treacherous miles on foot in a seemingly impossible attempt to reunite with their mother. The story consumed the Australian newspapers at the time and this adaptation wisely chooses reality over sentimentality. Its earthiness and even-handed direction are sadly lacking from most modern indie films. An absolute winner, from the Peter Gabriel score, to the performances, to the cinematography. Kenneth Branaugh does a grand job of making the viewer despise his character's very existence.

I am from Western Australia where this film is set and was filmed. This was and is a very strong and poignant film. I used to as a small child stay on a farm in the area the film was created and the farmer had young Aboriginals working and staying on his farm and it never struck me that they had been taken from their parents by force and then be instructed in the ways of the white fella, I was too young then at ten and this was my first incident of even seeing an Aboriginal.
The topic of the film or its contents were never discussed at home or at school so we never really got to know the history of the Aboriginal but fortunately all this has now changed and we live in more enlightened times or so we are led to believe.
There are more movies down here in Australia that deals with the Aboriginal topic so I hope this is not the only movie that makes it to the States.
I watch this movie over and over and never tire of it and the young girls determination to get back to their mothers and their homes and to do it all over again is incredible because if you have seen the bush and desert where the girls had to trek through someone like me would never make the first 20 miles due to my cushioned life. Do yourself a favour and buy it you won't be sorry.

1462985,5,B00005JLD4,"Phillip Noyce's Rabbit-Proof Fence is an example of movie making for others to follow.  For those interested in making a movie based on true expierences and hsitorical events, then watch this piece of work that is artistically compelling and both emotionally draining and uplifting.
To often, movies based on true events take too many liberities with a astory that both history and the essence of the events are missed and often, what develops is an artistic vision that bares little resemblance to the ""real thing."" (Think of The Untouchables or Nixon) This cheats the viewers who wish to connect with people of the past.  Noyce avoids all this by hiring actors like Kenneth Branaugh who turn in a perfect performance and childern to act who are not professionally trained, but come from the backgroud of the people he wishes to portray.
The story is about Molly Craig, a 14 year ""half-caste"" who is taken from her mother to be inculcated into the ""white system"" of Austriala's government.  She is abducted with her sister and cousain.  The cousian, Gracie, ends up being recaptured by the police, but Molly and her sister triumphantly return home.
This movie is so well done, that knowing the plot before hand does not discourage the viewer.  At times, one is emtionaly drained and at the end, we are both happy and sad.  The film score by Peter Gabriel's score is outstanding.  A beautiful viewing expiernce.",1062288000,,1411,4.878661087866109
1462986,5,B00005JLD4,"I don't know if we really have progressed that much past Australia's view (not that many years ago, mind you) of eliminating the Aborigines' gene pool from the face of the earth.  As a top govenment official, Kenneth Branagh's character is so real, so self righteously benevolent, he may be one of the scariest characters in movie history.  He's not quite a Hitler, not even close, but in many ways, he agrees with him.  He is a great example of subtle, well-intentioned evil.
The story of the girls' journey is an incredible one, and should make any person proud and wonder out loud what the human spirit is actually capable of.  Phillip Noyce is one incredible director, and this is  one of his two greatest films, along with the 'Quiet American.'",1062201600,,749,4.687022900763359
1462987,5,B00005JLD4,"Director Phillip Noyce, who has several notably successful films - both `artistically' and `commercially' - to his credit, has given viewers something very special indeed in this effort.  RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is moving and absorbing, and goes a long way in illustrating to the world the injustices that have been done to indigenous peoples - NOT just the Aborigines in Australia - in the name of `doing what is best for them'.  In attempting to impose what they think is best, colonizers from time immemorial have shattered and destroyed millions of families and lives - their arrogance has trampled on the souls of so many.  Facing up to this is the first step in righting wrongs, and - hopefully - in preventing their recurrence.  A novel I read recently - FUGITIVE PIECES, by Anne Michaels - summed it up nicely:  `History is the poisoned well, seeping into the groundwater.  It is not the unknown past we're doomed to repeat, but the past we know.'  In other words - learning about the mistakes of the past is all well and good, but if we don't learn FROM these mistakes, we have accomplished nothing.
This film is based on a book that chronicles the true story of three young girls on a perilous and courageous journey across 1500 miles of Outback terrain - terrain that is unforgiving as only that in Australia can be.  Ripped from their families by `well-meaning' government policies designed to civilize and train `half-caste' children (children born of mixed blood) and assimilate them back into white society, `breeding out the Black' over the course of 2-3 generations, the girls (ranging in age from 7 to 14) are traumatized beyond belief.  The strength and heart they show is moving and inspiring - if children can rise up and stand against the odds thrown against these three, we can accomplish anything.  The children who were thus `removed to government care' came to be known as `the stolen generations'.
Noyce was moved by the story itself - in the form of a screenplay presented to him - to make this film.  With successes in the past with such works as THE QUIET AMERICAN, THE BONE COLLECTOR, and two Harrison Ford box-office smashes, PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, he had the reputation to make this film happen - and it's a treasure.  I'll agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer below - the accompanying documentary on the making of the film, in which we can see the process used to find the three children to portray the main roles (the girls chosen had never acted before) is fascinating.  One part of the documentary shows the filming of the scene in which the girls are taken by government agents, literally torn from their mothers' arms - even knowing it was `only a scene in a film', when it was over there were tears in the eyes of not just the actors, but the director and film crew as well.  This is VERY moving subject matter - and it translates to the screen incredibly well, without ever lapsing into maudlin sentimentality.
Aside from the three girls (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan), everyone else in the cast does a nice job as well.  Kenneth Branagh does a fine, understated turn as A.O.Neville, the government official charged with `protecting' the Aboriginal peoples in his region.  Notable also is the well-known Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil - veteran of such classics as Peter Weir' THE LAST WAVE and Nicolas Roeg's WALKABOUT).  His presence is electrifying, as always - his portrayal of Moodoo the Tracker is successful on many levels, allowing him to illustrate how hard it was for an Aborigine to be `in the service' of the white man's government.  Moodoo's own daughter is a pupil at the government-run school where the three girls have been placed - so, while his loyalties to the government lead him to track the runaways, he is able to feel sympathy for their plight at the same time, admiring their skills and (I suspect) secretly hoping that they will elude him.
With all of these components adding up to a fine piece of filmmaking, I can't neglect to mention the amazing soundtrack music, composed and performed by Peter Gabriel.  He has taken the story into his heart and provided the viewer with nothing less than the spirit of the girls, their ordeal, story and courage, in musical form.  Incorporating many elements of Aboriginal music into his work makes it more powerful still - it's an important element that makes an outstanding contribution to the overall effect of the film.
There is violence in this film - both overt and psychological - but it is a violence that is an intrinsic part of the story.  There is no nudity that I remember - if it was present, it was so much a part of the lives depicted that it flowed naturally into the scheme of things.  There is only a hint of sexuality.  How in the world can a film be successful without sex, nudity, senseless violence, foul language and drugs?  This one does it - by taking a moving story (never forget:  taken from life) and painting it carefully, honestly and with great feeling onto the screen.  This is a film that should be seen by everyone - don't be afraid to view it with your entire family.",1061942400,,5152,4.7157190635451505
1462988,5,B00005JLD4,"Based on historical events, this film captures the trials and tribulations of three half-caste girls who fight against Australia's attempt of racial purification. During the 1931 Western Australia Aborigines Act all half-caste children are forcibly removed from their families to be reformed and educated in order to be re-entered into society as servants and caretakers for white families. Shortly after being abducted Molly and her two younger sisters escape and follow the rabbit-proof fence north to be reunited with their mother. This film mostly follows their 1500+ trek through the harsh Australian territory while being actively hunted. RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is a beautiful film that successfully captures the emotional and physical aspects of this story. The cinematography and music were brilliant and lends an additional element to the film. The documentary on the selection of the three children to act in the film is also very informative and entertaining. RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is a film well-worth viewing.

Which defeats the purpose of actually reading these reviews, huh?
Anyways, you will find it hard to believe the atrocities inflicted upon the Aboriginal population in Australia, in our not-so-distant past. It's shocking. The events are so fantastic that they stretch the limit of believability, until the last shots of the film. In our living room, a hushed silence followed the final images as the credits rolled.
The young actors are marvelous...the eldest daughter has a fresh, very real presence and at times, this unshakable haunted gaze. She's transfixing.
Kenneth Branagh, despite the marketing, has a small role, competently done. You need to know this movie is all about the kids and their struggle against the Australian establishment.

1463108,5,B00005JLD4,"In Australia prior to 1970, the law gave the ""Chief Protector of the Aborigines"" legal guardianship of all the Aborigine people and the power to forcibly remove half-white Aborigines from their homes and place them in schools where they would be educated in the ways of White society. In 1931, the ""Chief Protector of the Aborigines"" was a man named A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branaugh). ""Rabbit-Proof  Fence"" is the story of three half-Aborigine girls whom Mr. Neville ordered removed from their mothers' care and the girls' courageous journey back home. Molly(Everlyn Sampi), who was the oldest at 14 years, her young sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury), and their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan) were placed far from their home in the ""Moore River Native Settlement"" for their education. This is the story of the girls' 9-week journey on foot, following Australia's continent-spanning rabbit-proof fence, to try to reach their home and family in northern Australia.

""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a true story, based on the book written by Molly's daughter, Doris Pilkington. This is a stunningly beautiful film in its portrayal of the Australian landscape and its native peoples. Thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the excellent performances, ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is riveting all the way through even though the story of people trudging across a continent on foot offers little variation. Everlyn Sampi gives an outstanding performance as Molly, who is responsible for the fate of her young charges for the course of their arduous journey. Molly is a young woman of few words, but she speaks volumes with her eyes and is magnetic in her ability to fix the audience's attention on the screen. The other great performance is that of Kenneth Branaugh as A.O. Neville, the cause of all the girls' -and many other Aborigines'- troubles. It would have been very easy -but inaccurate, I think- to portray Neville as a horrible power-mongering bureaucrat. With relatively few scenes or dialogue, Branaugh effectively communicates that Neville's intentions were essentially good and that he took his responsibilities seriously. That said, the film does not shy away from demonstrating that his actions were misguided and ultimately very destructive to Australia's Aborigine people and to the nation's moral fabric. Highly recommended.",1057881600,18,2320,5.353424657534247
1463109,5,B00005JLD4,"This is a very compelling story about the Australian Government policy from the early 1900's through 1970 to relocate Aborigine children to orphanages by taking them from their families and their mothers.  What is lacking is the usual guns and bloodshed associated with genocide, but the goal is the same.  To entirely wipe out a culture is the purpose of genocide, and bloodless genocide is no less a crime against humanity.  In the case, the Aborigne culture of Australia is over 40,000 years old and maybe the oldest surviving culture on Earth. Gracie, Daisy, and Molly did not cooperate with this plan of the ""master race,"" and ran away.  This was the start of a 1,500 mile walk home.  Three little girls knew that if they found the rabbit proof fence that stretched across Australia and headed north, they would end up at home.  This is a stretch of land that is one of the most forbidding on the planet.
This is the story about the ""lost generations."" Both the trek home and committing this wonderful story of survival against wrong were monumental tasks. Director Phillip Noyce conducted numerous auditions with aborigne girls.  After he makes his selections, he warns them, like any good grandfather, to not get spoiled.  Like other grandfathers, he then proceeds to spoil what seems to be his three adopted grandchildren.  A less kind hearted Director would not be able to pull off what this movie accomplishes.  The special features of the DVD documents how the film crew became like a family, with all of the playfullness, teasing, tears, arguments and making up of a real family (or tribe).  When the scene was shot for the movie of the girls being taken away from their families, there were tears and charged emotions put on film.  When the scene ended and the cameras stopped, the crew had to take a prolonged break because the emotions hadn't stopped.  Aboriginal actresses and acting coaches along with the white crew had to hug and cry all the way out what they had started.  Later, when you see the aborigine girls during informal play  and interaction with others, it is easy to recognize the similarities to the little princess daughter or grand daughter you may have at home.
Please don't miss the deeper levels of this movie.  If you look deeper, there is quite a statement within this movie about motherhood, daughterhood, and sisterhood. Perhaps, even a mother nature/earth statement.  A full response to the governments question of intelligence is a challenge to come up with a universal standard.  Is intelligence quotations from Shakespeare while undergoing death by thirst, starvation and elements in the outback?  Or is it squeezing the water from roots of plants, catching, roasting and eating giant lizards or eating beetle larva.  I know exactly whom I want to be with in the outback. It isn't Sydney from Sydney.  It is Gracie, Daisy, and Molly. It is Moodoo, the tracker in this film that is pretending to follow the girls but never quite catching them.  Can you recognize him?
He is the same person that played the Aborigne teenager many years ago in ""Walk About.""  He looks like he is in the same physical condition and ready for the next ""walk about.""

1463114,5,B00005JLD4,"One word: Incredible.  I don't remember this movie getting much press when it was released, but it should have.  This is a top 10 movie for 2002 in my eyes.  Rabbit-Proof Fence was directed by Philip Noyce (The Quiet American) and is set in 1930's Australia.  Australia had a policy regarding the Aborignal natives.  A child born of an aboriginal parent and white parent was known as being half-caste.  The government would not allow these children to be raised in their aboriginal families and they were taken away.  Rabbit-Proof Fence follows three girls who were taken from their village and relocated 1200 miles away.  Before I forget to mention it, this is a true story and is based on a book written by the daughters of one of these girls.
The film follows Molly, Daisy, and Gracie: three children whose ages range from 8-14.  They are ripped from the arms of their mothers (literally) and taken to the reform school more than a thousand miles away (as far away as New York is from California).  The school tries to strip them of their culture.  They are introduced to Christianity (as a Christian I feel the religion is true and is a good thing, but it should be a choice not forced upon somebody), can only speak English and they are introduced to an entirely new lifestyle.  This is inter-cut with the director of this program giving a lecture on why the half-caste children are a real threat and why they should be taken care of and eventually have the black bred out of them.  Kenneth Branagh plays this man, and while he is the villain, he honestly believes that he is doing right and that he is doing the right thing by the half-caste children.  By no means is he a sympathetic character, but we see that he is misguided and mistaken instead of evil.  He truly believes that the school is the best place for the children.  We also see a scene of a runaway being brought back in.  No runaway had ever escaped for long.
Molly leads Gracie and Daisy to escape.  Most of the movie is of the trek back to their home and evading the tracker (extremely skilled).  They are aided at times by white and black citizens and aboriginals, some knowing exactly where these children came from.  It is an incredible journey and if it wasn't a true story I'm not sure I would have believed it was possible.  At the very end of the film we see a shot of Molly and Gracie as old women.  They are walking together.  That was a beautiful shot and even knowing that this was true, that shot makes it hit home.  These are the women that escaped as children.  The postscript on the screen adds to the heartbreak of the movie.
I don't think I can speak enough as to how good of a movie Rabbit-Proof Fence is.  It is one of the best of the year and is a movie that deserves to be seen.  The more people that see this movie, it will be more likely that films like this will be made.",1055808000,3,2868,4.382575757575758

Unfortunately, the practice of separating indiginous children from their families and homes and sending them away to be re-educationed, Christianized, and de-cultured also happened in the United States.  Many Native American children were taken from their homes and sent to schools where they were not allowed to speak their native tongue or observe any cultural tradition.

Then to see an extreme example of this philosophy by the dominant white Australians against the aboriginal people, right into the 1970s. Painful, but a story that should be told, and told as well as in this movie.
The three young aborigine girls are forcibly removed from their village and taken off to a kind of boarding school to make them discard their culture and language. Like some other reviewers I credit this movie for focusing on the determination of the young girls, especially their 14-year-old leader, Molly, to escape from such a place and walk back a long, long way to their village, through all kinds of obstacles, including a hired aborigine tracker on their trail.

So often these are thrown onto a DVD as a ""bonus"", but amount to nothing more than a refried re-telling of the film. Here, instead, we are treated to forty-five minutes of how Philip Noyce selected his three young actresses, and all the trials and tribulations that entailed. The scene in the film of the three children being taken from their mothers is a very heart-wrenching scene. But, moving beyond compare is that same scene as caught by the ""making of"" cameras during and after the shoot. Many of the people behind the cameras were in tears during the actual filming of the scene. At the end of the scene, the character mothers are on the ground crying and Noyce yells, ""CUT!"". He looks down and you can hear the actresses still crying. He looks up and around the camera with a puzzled look on his face to see if perhaps the actresses did not hear him yell, ""CUT"". They are all still on the ground sobbing, and he has to go over to console them, saying ""Woa, Woa, Woa..."" to calm them down and bring them out of it because everyone was so drawn into the event they were reenacting they forgot they were only filming a scene.

1463227,4,B00005JLD4,"RABBIT PROOF FENCE illustrates a piece of Australian history that I, as an American, knew nothing about.  From 1931 to 1970, the aborigines were under the ""guardianship"" of a British bureaucrat, with the particular idea of separating ""half-caste"" aborigines from their full-blooded parents and putting them in a home so they could learn how to be servants and low-wage employees.
We follow three girls (aged 8-14) who are separated from their homes and placed in this camp some 1200 miles away.  Molly, the oldest girl, who is quite clever and spirited, leads the three on a daring escape and journey back to their home.  Their journey is amazing, because the endure lengthy hardships in the desert, little food, and the treachery of some adults they meet who try to turn these famous refugees over to authorities.
They do meet help along the way too, but always they have to be wary of anyone they run into.  The movie has flashes of humor, beautiful scenery and some heart-wrenching scenes.
Kenneth Branagh plays Neville, the bureaucrat, and is the only ""star"" in the movie.  His part is quite small...he handles it well, but it is NOT his movie.  The movie belongs to these three inexperienced actresses, who were ""discovered"" by director Philip Noyce and put to work in these tricky parts.  And they pull it off so well.  They are all outstanding at conveying their sense of fear, of outrage, or courage and they have a certain stillness that shows how reserved they feel around these white strangers who have uprooted them.
The movie is not exactly fast-paced, but I found it fascinating all the way through.  It quietly draws us in, because we are rooting for the lead characters.
The fact that this is a TRUE story (we meet some of the main characters towards the end) makes it all the more riveting.  It's one of those rare films that completely educates you about an obscure but important part of history, but entirely through the power of great storytelling.  We never feel we are ""learning,"" yet at the end of the movie, you want to go find out more about this time in history.
The movie is rated PG, but might not be very interesting to kids under 11 or so.  A recommended experience!
(By the way, the bonus feature on the DVD about the making of the film is outstanding.  So often, these little features are nearly worthless, but we spend 40 minutes learning how the kids were discovered and trained.

Unwilling to endure the seperation from their loved ones, the girls dedicate themselves to escaping back to their home.  The three untrained child actors deliver stunning, authentic performances.  Kenneth Branagh's performance as policy director A.O.

1463229,3,B00005JLD4,"Who would have guessed that Australia, of all places, would have such race purifying regulations in place until as recently as 1970?  These regulations allowed the Australian government to abduct any half-castes (mix-breed, Aboriginal/Caucasion) and relocate them into camps, not only to force western culture, religion and language upon them, but also to prevent them from mating with full-blood aboriginals in order to cleanse the aboriginal culture into non-existence.  Trust me, you won't believe it, even after you see it.
Technically, Rabbit-Proof Fence is a chase movie, utilizing many of the Hollywood conventions of close-calls, miscues, and a soundscape that adds to the tensions tenfold.  The film is also so much more, especially emotionally, with wonderfully developed characters (this is often over-looked in Hollywood chase movies).
The three half-caste girls (Sampi, Sansbury and Monaghan) give some of the most natural child performances in cinema, especially considering that during a majority of the film they only have each other to play off of.  They truly give the film a natural, honest, documentary feel which adds so much to the emotional impact.  Branagh, though not very ""natural"", brilliantly portrays the man behind the cleansing scheme, a man that could quite easily hang with Hitler and hold his own in conversations about the ways and means to white supremecy.
Its so nice to see something this fresh and touching, a film that doesn't come up roses in the end, but still leaves with much hope and heart.

The girls were trained to be servants and domestics. The whole system was similar to the Indian schools in the United States, where First Nations children were sent to be raised as pious, productive, educated young adults, but the system there too frequently failed. The plan was that the half-caste girls would marry whites or other half-castes and have the Aboriginal ""bred out of them,"" as policy director A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) explains to a local ladies' society.
Daisy, Molly and Gracie are sent to the Moore River Native Settlement in Perth, over 2000 kilometres from their home in Jigalong Station. They do not last more than a few days before Molly, the ringleader, plans their escape through brush and desert, finding her way home by following the rabbit-proof fence, the longest in the world, that divides pasture from rabbit-infested bush. Neville and his men, including a skilled Aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (film veteran David Gulpilil) search for weeks in pursuit of the girls, and one is eventually recaptured in a harrowing scene, only steps from safety with the other girls.
There is very little in the way of dialogue, and although Noyce's child actors are all unskilled, there are remarkable performances and true moments of fear, desperation, and grief shine through. The girls' mother and grandmother are particularly effective at conveying the mind-shattering grief they must live with knowing that they may never see their girls again. In one touching scene, at separate points on the fence, thousands of kilometres apart, both the mother and the girls tightly grip the fence, lightly shaking it, as if they could feel the resulting vibrations and sense the others' presence there.
The cinematography shows off the dry palette of the desert, the spectacular desert sunsets, the shimmering wave of heat that covers the landscape. This film reminded me in some ways of the 1971 Australian film ""Walkabout,"" which starred Gulpilil as an Aboriginal teenager, and follows two white children that are stranded in the outback with only Gulpilil as a guide. The ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" score by Peter Gabriel is low-key and appropriately tension-filled, meditative and mysterious at key moments, with wisps of Aboriginal chant and song woven into a lush synth background, and reminded me of the excellent soundtrack to Australian sci-fi series ""Ocean Girl"" by Garry McDonald and Laurie Stone. The narration at the beginning and end of the movie was the most powerful for me: the real-life Molly and Daisy, now old women in bright clothes that are startlingly out of place against the backdrop of the outback they slowly walk through, tell how the story ended. And that was the saddest truth of all.
The included documentary ""Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" shows Noyce flying to remote outback communities looking for Aboriginal child actors, auditioning thousands of hopefuls before settling on the final three, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan, as well as the emotional journey for the temperamental star and the harrowing experience of filming the girls' abduction at the hands of a white officer. Pretty much the whole cast and crew was in tears and shaken afterwards, forced to relive the crucial moment that defined the ""Stolen Generations:"" the theft from their mothers' arms, some never to be seen or heard from again.
An excellent film that treats a little-known subject outside of Australia (and fairly unspoken within), with the fresh-faced innocence of children who beat the odds and found their way home across 2000 km of largely uninhabited, hostile terrain to the waiting arms of their family.",1053129600,13,4000,5.193498452012384

1463325,5,B00005JLD4,"Director Phillip Noyce has succeeded in creating a cinematic version of the true book about the 'racial cleansing' of the Australian Aborigines that took part in the first half of the 20th Century.  The Australian government subsidized campsites to where half caste Aboriginal girls would be sent to breed with white men and thus diminish the ethnic qualities of the 'backward natives'. In three genrations the half castes could produce dilution of the 'blackness' of their people by creating half castes > camaroons > octaroons who would have at least the physical characteristics of whites.  This horid bit of history is brought to light by director Noyce in a sophisticated, straight forward, very tender rendering of the escape of three sisters by following the course of the rabbit-proof fence extending from their displacemnet camp in Northern Australia to their home 1500 miles to the South.  Most of the film dwells on the odyssey of Molly, Gracie, and Daisy as they stalwartly defy desert, hunger, fear and the trackers to reach their home.  Noyce wisely uses three inordinately fine young  Aboriginal girls to play the key roles. The evil incarnate Kenneth Branaugh summarizes the Australian government plan, and the remainder of the cast is uniformly excellent.  Photographed in a tone that suggests the bleak wildness of the Australian desert, this little film is a monument to the indefatigable spirit and soul of the Aborigines, and as such this film stands as an important document in the studies about human rights.  Beautifull made with touching simplicity, RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is a film that will enhance your knowledge while nurturing your spirit.  Highly Recommended.",1050537600,,1686,5.218518518518518

That said, this is not a film strictly about 'That Evil Racist', although it is a testament to Branaugh's thespian talent that the man doesn't come off reeking of that despicable label.
Nary a false note in this exquisitely realised film. One of the few films regarding racial 'misunderstandings' (too light a word?), which eschews the 'monority of the week' tag it could effortlessly have settled for. For the most part, this deceptively slight film is markedly restrained, with director Noyce eliciting brave performances from his untrained leads. Granted, a poorly executed, sappy reunifiation scene between mother and daughters does, unfortunately, drain and unjustly cheapen some of the resonance held within the staggering final shot. Then again, it is based on a book by the protagonists' daughter, the most availably irrefutable outlook on 'what really happened'.
Single irk aside, the simple, linear narrative trajectory should, strictly speaking, have lapsed (read: degenerated) into an empty, soporific morality tale or outraged, absurdly overwrought, vacuous polemic. It is heartening to suspect that there are a miniscule number of racially infused 'genre films' being made that can have a gratifying (but not gratuitous) emotional (dare I say 'uplifting', do not be put off by the word.... just this once) effect on an audience. Two minor key but worthy efforts from Philip 'Patriot Games' Noyce in quick succession? (the other being 'The Quiet American', based on a Graham Greene novel dating from the late fifties, which attempts to 'symbolically' lay bare the antecedents of the Vietnam War) Hmmm. Maybe the Antipodian has embarked on a twelve film rehabilitation programme.

The aboriginal girls win this round in Noyce's account & the footage of the actual protagonists to end the film  leave the impression that I believe Noyce wants to achieve.

  Before one scorns what appears to be the abyssmal ignorance of the white interlopers into Australian culture, the almost successful genocide perpertrated in the Americas should be thoroughly considered and digested.  Tne mistakes made in

1463329,5,B00005JLD4,"This movie is one of the greatest pieces of film-making I have ever seen.  Philip Noyce's handling of the untrained young actors Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sainsbury and Laura Monoghan who played Molly, Daisy and Gracie respectively, and his light touch on the plot are truly spectacular. This film has an emotional intensity and an intimate scale which makes the grandstanding by other ""socially conscious"" film makers seem mawkish or banal by comparison.  The performances of the actors is wonderful, especially Sampi and one hopes that this will be a turning point for three-dimensional aboriginal ensemble actors in motion pictures (although of course, this is Hollywood in action so any prospect of long-term social benefit has to be taken with an Uluru-sized grain of salt).
As a record of what happened during the 60 plus year period (1909  early 1970s) when the Australian government carried out its policy of forcible relocation of part-Aboriginal children in order to ""lighten the race"" into extinction, this film is devastating in its impact. Readers who are interested can get a pretty  good introduction to the issues by going to the Rabbit Proof Fence website.
I'd like to add a couple of things here to the points that have already been made about the film.  First of all, one of the strongest points of the movie is that the villains of the piece (in particular Kenneth Branagh's A. O. Neville) were totally convinced of the rightness of their cause and the subhumanity of Aboriginal people.
Writing in the early teens, one of Neville's fellow proponents of child removal wrote  ""I would not hesitate to separate any half-caste from its Aboriginal mother, no matter how frantic momentary grief might be at the time. They soon forget their offspring.""  This same luminary noted that Aboriginal women were ""prostitutes at heart"" and that all Aboriginal people were ""dirty, filthy [and] immoral"".  It should be pointed out that similar viewpoints were held towards the urban poor during this time period in all European countries, and their white colonies.  Social Darwinist thinkers cast these groups along with Jews, Slavs, blacks, Asians and Natives of any kind as human trash to be eternal servants to the master race or victims of the march of progress.
Secondly, on top of the forcible destruction of aboriginal families, the film also raises the issue of the sexual exploitation of young aboriginal women by white men.  One of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie for me was when Mavis (played by Deborah Mailman), a ""graduate"" of Neville's school who is the servant and sex slave of a white farming family begs the girls to stay with her: ""If you're here, he won't come back"".
Mavis represents the implicit fate of many of the young girls taken from their families.  These young women were a convenient and powerless source of domestic labor for settler families to recreate the master-servant power dynamic that Australians had supposedly rejected.  Interestingly, a similar fate awaited some of the British evacuee children who were sent to live in Australia during World War 2.
The last thing I want to note about the film is that the real Molly (shown with her sister at the end of the film) felt that the film should have been about the greater tragedy of her life: ten years after she escaped from Moore River, she was subsequently recaptured with her own two daughters, she managed to escape again with the younger one (Annabelle) but  was forced to leave the other (Doris Pilkington Garimara, who became the author of the book on which the movie is based) behind.  Molly did not see Doris again for 25 years.  Annabelle was taken again when she was brought in for treatment for an eye infection a year later in 1942.  To this day, 60 years later, Molly  has received no contact from her youngest daughter.",1048636800,27,3835,4.911764705882353
1463330,5,B00005JLD4,"This movie is by far the most amazing film I've ever seen. I was completely stunned and shocked by its basis on a true story that happened within the last 100 years in what is considered a ""civilized"" country. There are amazing parallels between the events in both the US and Australia regarding their native peoples, and this film really brings that point home.
I actually cried during this movie, and when it was over my friend and I couldn't speak for a while due to the emotions that we were feeling. When we finally did speak, it was in hushed voices with reverence for the characters and their plight, and the knowledge that this was just one story of many children who suffered the under the same circumstances.
The reason I consider this to be a wonderful movie is for the emotions it invoked. It's not the type of movie that you'd call good for mind-numbing entertainment value, which is what usually passes for ""good"", but it was a wonderful movie for bringing you into its world and making you feel real emotions. I also like that it brought the knowledge of the ""Stolen Generations"" to a wider audience, an audience that might not have even known of the Australian policies towards their native peoples in the recent past.",1047686400,9,1234,4.613636363636363
1463331,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence (Phillip Noyes, 2002)
If Rabbit-Proof Fence is not the best film of 2002, it's certainly within the top three, and missed 'best' by a short nose. Noyce, who is known for directing junk, not to put too fine a point on it,(Patriot Games, Sliver, Clear and Present Danger, et al), gives us his first good film since all the way back in 1989, when he took the boating scene from The Talented Mr. Ripley and turned it into the brilliant Dead Calm.
Rabbit-Proof Fence is the story of three racially mixed girls, Molly (the hauntingly beautiful Everlyn Sampi in her screen debut, which has already garnered her at least one Best Actress nod), her sister Daisy (Tianna Sanbury, also a newcomer), and their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan, and you know the refrain by now). Pitted against them is, well, all of Australian white society, and a select few aborigines as well. The three girls are taken from their home in Jigalong and sent to the Moore River camp for girls, sort of a twisted Outback version of a finishing school for indentured servants. The head of the camp (and then, through the magic of cinema, the voice of Australian white society) is Neville 'the Devil,' played by Kenneth Branagh. Despite Neville's veneer of civility, and the complexity of his feelings for aborigines ('just because they use Neolithic tools does not mean they have Neolithic minds,' he says to an assistant at one point during the film), the girls see through this faade right quick and decide to walk home, a journey of some twelve hundred mile across the Australian outback. In order to do so, they have to follow the rabbit-proof fence of the film's title, erected in the outback to keep the plagues of (British-imported) rabbits away from the farmlands.
The first fifteen minutes of Rabbit-Proof fence are some of the most difficult footage to watch ever filmed; Noyce's camera angles and rapid cuts are disturbingly effective during the scenes leading up to the removal of Molly and her cohorts. Horror film aficionados in the audience will immediately recognize the camerawork as a pastiche of trickery first pioneered by George A. Romero (the blindingly fast cuts are a trademark of Dawn of the Dead, and anyone who's ever seen night of the Living Dead will recognize the car-interior perspective of people beating on the windows from early in that film). So, perhaps, Noyce has learned something from his time in America. Too bad he didn't use it when making The Saint.
The film calms down from there, but stays on an emotionally high pitch throughout even when the pace slows down. The last hour of the film almost has to be slow by definition; it's hard to keep a pace up when your main plot point is three girls walking for over a thousand miles.
Perhaps the best thing about Rabbit-Proof fence is that Noyce doesn't take the easy way out and turn this into a road movie. The trek isn't used as an excuse for us to watch long scenes of the three girls bonding by firelight, nor are we given long intercut scenes of what's happening in the world around them (they pick up news of pursuit from people they encounter along the way, but cut scenes of their pursuers, and Neville's reaction to the continuing frustration of same, are kept mercifully short throughout). As a result, the movie runs barely over ninety minutes, which is just about what it should be. Noyce gives the material the necessary amount of time to tell the story, and not more.
Absolutely stunning. A must-see film for those who rightly believe there's something wrong with the Academy's heads for nominating the tripe they did for the Academy Awards this year. **** ",1047254400,3,3645,4.758293838862559

Rather, we were taught of the nation's past, lest we forget & then, we can make sure that the Australia of the future shall never be the same again.  It's really unbelievable and inconceivable that the Government of that time really believed that the assimmilation program was the best thing that could happen to the half caste children.  The notion of freedom & individual rights is definitely not considered then.  The premise of the runaway girls to return to their home is both disturbing and moving at the same time, amid the vast & hostile landscape of Australia, and the police that were hot on their trails.  Kenneth Branagh was simply brilliant as the Protector of the Aborigines, who was also called the Devil by the children.  But the stars of the show would have to be those runaway girls who were so natural with their roles.  Noyce, the Director has proven that you don't need to have a big budget to create a powerful and poignant movie.  To these days, land rights are still fought between the Aborigines and the Australian Government, and the living condition of the Aborigines is as bad as the Third World countries or worse.  There is simply a huge gap between their living standard against the rest of Australia, and we wondered have we done enough for them?

But, as docudrama's unfold we are again brought to the fore to witness yet another crime against each other. Rabbit-Proof Fence is such a docudrama, as we see the gov't of Australia take half white aboriginal children away from their mothers arms and send them off to schools to be taught to be domestics and to be parterned with other breeds to cull out the aborigine blood in three generations. The great men who thought this up would have fit in with Hitler like a glove.  And to think that this program did not end until 1970s is beyond belief.

Referred to by all the aboriginals as Mr. Devil, Branagh gives a chilling performance, thin-lipped and brimming with self-righteousness--the classic do-gooder who is so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he will go to any lengths to see it to fruition.
Inspiring and ultimately heartbreaking, this true tale of three small girls--led by 14-year-old indomitable Molly--determined to find their way home--twelve hundred miles of unforgiving terrain--is not to be missed.

1463426,5,B00005JLD4,"This is a marvelously successful movie that is especially moving because the story it tells is true. RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is the story of how Australia for several decades took half-caste aboriginal children (i.e., children of mixed white and aboriginal parentage) and raised them in what was essentially an orphanage school to become domestic servants. The film focuses on three girls--Molly, Daisy, and Gracie--who live beside one of Australia's rabbit-proof fences that cover the country and are taken from their mother to live at the school. The bulk of the movie tells of their escape and 1300 mile journey following the rabbit-proof fence back to their mother.
Three things stand out about this movie. First, the simplicity of the story. This is a movie that has easily identifiable good and bad guys. The policy the government embarked on for several decades was obviously and irredeemably racist and evil, and in part made more tragic by not being widely reported. I know a couple of Australians living here in Chicago, and both say they had never heard of this practice while growing up. This film does an enormous service to humankind by publicizing this great crime.
Second, the performances by the three girls in the central roles are marvelous. In particular, Everylyn Sampi, as Molly, the oldest of the three girls, stands out. What is remarkable is the three girls were utter amateurs, with no acting experience at all. Sampi manages to imbue her Molly with both great intelligence and iron-willed determination.
Third, the film is both a visual and aural delight. I have over the years seen a lot of films shot in Australia, most of them much further east than this one. Most of it occurs in areas of Australia that are less familiar. I saw this film in a theater with five-point sound, and I have rarely seen a film that made better use of that than this one.
This is one of those films that no fan of film should miss. It tells a magnificent and true story well. One of the most moving moments is when two of the real life girls, now elderly women, are shown. Just a great movie.",1042848000,66,2095,4.758241758241758
1463427,5,B00005JLD4,"Rabbit-Proof Fence is an amazing movie based on a dark period in Australia's history. Half-caste children are taken from their Aborigine mothers and raised in camps, with the goal of helping them make the transition from their ""primitive"" lifestyle to the white world. Although the camps are not horrible, the fact that the children/families have no choice is.
3 girls defy the system and escape. Their plan is to follow the rabbit-proof fence (that's being/been built across Australia) to get back to their home - 1200 miles away! The girls range from 8 to 14 years old. They find some help along the way but it's primarily their will to get back home that gets them through. What makes this even more amazing is that it really happened! In fact, the 14 year old made the trip twice after being returned to the camp after her first successful escape.
The movie avoids preaching about the wrongness of the Aborigine Act but, instead, focuses on showing the various sides of the story - the whites who honestly feel that they are helping the children, the whites along the way who help the girls even knowing that they have escaped, the Aborigine tracker who can't seem to find the girls despite his skills, and, of course, the children and families impacted.
Rabbit-Proof Fence reminded me of the Railway Children in the US - another story that should be told!",1041984000,32,1360,4.742616033755274
1463428,5,B00005JLD4,"A beautiful stark film. An amazing story, almost Disney-esque about young heroines refusing to accept their fate. It is cowardly to put their final fates in printed coda at the end but sensible. The film would have been grotesquely unwatchable and depressing if the film had followed the girls into adulthood. It would have left us with epic deadness. This movie is about a holocaust but is what Schindler's List should have been...intimate, people centered, uplifting for the victories tasted...one gets to know three girls and the coda leaves one to ruminate about the evil done with banal and deliberate thought.",1041984000,2,615,5.099009900990099
1463429,5,B00005JLD4,"In RABBIT-PROOF FENCE, it's early 1930s Australia and A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) is the government pencil-pusher empowered to ""protect"" the native aboriginals, part of which policy is to forcibly remove half-caste children from their native homes and send them to special schools where they can be ""improved"" by the ways and language of the whites. Rather than being a cruel or bad man, Neville is a well-intentioned and paternalistic bureaucrat whose working theory of racial superiority is at the benevolent end of the spectrum, the other end being the extermination camps of Hitler's Third Reich. As Neville puts it, ""The native must be helped in spite of himself.""
Three children abducted from their home under this program are Molly (14), her sister Daisy (8), and cousin Gracie (10). They're transported to a school 1,200 miles away. Very soon after arriving, Molly decides to escape and walk back home. She convinces Daisy and Gracie to accompany her. The trek back is along the RABBIT-PROOF FENCE, a wire mesh barrier thousands of miles long stretching from the north to southern coasts of Western Australia, and which was designed to keep wild rabbits from devastating the crop lands.
The three aboriginal children who play the roles of Molly, Daisy and Gracie (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan respectively) are untrained actors, but you wouldn't know it by the performances they give. Molly is especially impressive as the one whose strength must keep her companions moving forward on the long march, as well as provide the cunning and skill to avoid both the roving constables on the lookout and the old aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (David Gulpilil), used by the school to hunt down runaways.
RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is based on a true story, a fact brought home to the audience by the film's last scene.  It's an amazing and moving tribute to the pluck of three children determined to foil the foolish and insensitive policy of a misguided government. This film is not, and probably won't ever be, in wide release. Do yourself a favor and seek it out - and take the kids.",1041379200,6,2099,4.997142857142857
1463430,5,B00005JLD4,"The year is 1931 and many well meaning leaders of Australia's dominant white culture share the view of British Chief Protector of Aborigines A. O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) that the Aborigine ""in spite of himself, the native must be helped."" Doris Pilkington in 1996 wrote ""Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" about the abduction of Molly (Everlyn Sampi), her younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Grace (Laura Monaghan) from their backward and illiterate surroundings. Their mother can offer them a loving home, but the government's educational facility can prepare them to participate more fully in the advanced world of the 20th Century. Director Phillip Noyce does not make the mistake and demonize Neville. The man's heart is truly in the right place. Neville is a racist who adheres to the pseudoscientific theories popular during that era. Surprisingly, his racism is not of the segregationist variety. Neville truly desires full integration of the Aborigine into Australian society. He realizes, quite accurately, that the future prospects of these children will dramatically improve if they become westernized. Regretfully, Neville fails to realize that he has no right to force assimilation upon these Aborigine families. The girls escape from the school and must travel over a thousand miles to return to the land of their ancestors. Neville will not rest until they are safely back in custody. The story revolves around their courageous high risk adventure in avoiding capture and surviving the brutal outback environment. The incredibly beautiful music of Peter Gabriel conveys the inner turmoil of both the benevolent dictators and their innocent and uncomprehending prey. Isn't some sort of compromise possible? Is there anyway of reaching a win-win result?
The new world is unrelentingly clashing with that of the old---and Western Civilization as defined by Matthew Arnold must ultimately prevail. The values of the West are nothing more than the championing of the best that has ever been said and written in human history. Race, ethnicity, and religion are not relevant factors. People of Caucasian pigmentation do not inherently have a monopoly on the truth. ""Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a beautiful film dealing with the awkward issues surrounding the assimilation of the uninitiated into Western society. We are reminded that the so-called natives still have rights that cannot be ruthlessly ignored. The imposition of the minimal values underpinning a viable social order is warranted. After that, only the process of political and social conversion is acceptable. There is also no reason whatsoever to abandon the valid traditions of the indigenous culture. I strongly recommend that everyone in your family sees this powerful and spellbinding movie. It might also behoove me to add that the previously mentioned author Doris Pilkington is is the daughter of Molly.",1041292800,14,2902,5.408388520971302

Noyce does a beautiful job.  This historical drama is something all ages should see. I am in awe of these girls courage and determination. This is a saga that is still continuing in their lives of those who remain.
As a mother, I just can't imagine the pain and suffering these women went through and how blind those who partook in this tradegy were. I am fasinated at every detail of the story and would like to learn more.",1041206400,5,593,4.342342342342342

7939339,5,B00005JLD4,"It is a movie about three aboriginal girls who are forcibly taken from their families in 1931 to be trained as domestic servants as part of an official Australian government policy. They make a daring escape and embark on an epic 1,500-mile journey to get back home following the rabbit-proof fence that bisects the Australian continent with the authorities chasing after them. When the fourteen-year-old aboriginal girl Molly Craig is taken from her mother in Jigalong with her eight-year-old sister Daisy Kadibill and their ten-year-old cousin Gracie Fields to the distant Moore River Native Center, they run away trying to return to the tribe in the desert. They are chased by skilled tracker Moodoo and the police under the command of Neville and have to survive to their long back home. This goes to show how some indigenous religion perceived certain things in life and how some other people want to change there the way they live and worship. This movie shows how most indigenous religions were forced to be sanitized the population and how they were trying to take away the way they worship as individuals.",1523145600,,1114,4.962566844919786
