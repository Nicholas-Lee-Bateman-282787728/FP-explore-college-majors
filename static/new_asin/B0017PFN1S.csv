8266821,5,B0017PFN1S,"For all the History Channel shows that have aired, their dumbest decision was to not continue on with this program. This show goes into the details of some of the most incredible, shocking moments that have been captured on tape. Historic events that have changed society that people never knew about. The show uses CGI to demonstrate the anatomy of an incident and talks to the witnesses and survivors who were a part of the the story. Just a great show.",1366761600,,455,4.62962962962963

We happened to catch this program on the history channel and it was all about incredible events that put man in mortal danger and the rescue operation that followed. Each event, some planned, others obviously unplanned were filmed and put together with the story line in a most gripping manner. To further clarify the incredible events unfolding before our eyes, there are clear computerized images.
All together, Shockwave by the History Channel, is put together exceptionally well and is a suspense drama with real people whose lives are on the brink of death. The narration is clear and to the point. The amazing photography and filming makes you part of the event and you find yourself hoping each one will survive what appears to be the impossible. I would recommend for any age.",1209686400,8,994,5.958041958041958
