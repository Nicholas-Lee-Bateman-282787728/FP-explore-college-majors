4586151,4,B00561BNJA,"This movie can stand on its own, but the book on which it is based is much better.  In fact, I highly recommend that you read the book before seeing the movie.  Of necessity, the movie makers have left out much of the detail that led up to the action shown.  It is an exciting movie, but I wish that a mini-series had been made to fully explore the content of the book.",1331856000,3,369,4.027397260273973
4586152,5,B00561BNJA,"I have been watching for the DVD offering of ""Riddle of the Sands"" since DVDs first became available and was excited to finally find it at Amazon.

I first learned sbout it when it did a short and much ignored run in the theaters in the late 70's. It was recommended by a fellow sailor during a discussion of sailing movies. Since then it's become a kind of ""cult"" movie for sailors.

The movie follows fairly closely the novel by Erskine Childers whose own exciting life created an excellent platform for his book of the same name. Childers was executed by a firing squad during the Irish Revolution.

This movie was a real sleeper when it was released and that's too bad because it's a top-flight sailing spy adventure with a little romance thrown in. In my opinion, it's a four-star movie and should have been an award winner.",1327363200,16,829,4.550335570469799
4586153,5,B00561BNJA,"OK, right up front I need to preface this by saying that this movie takes place in one of my favorite periods in history and one in which very few movies take place - the early 1900's PRIOR to World War I. It is well filmed in color and takes place in the North Sea islands between Britian and Germany, and is simply a great prewar spy show with a plot of a ""Pearl Harbor"" type attack on, well, I won't spoil it, being exposed before it can happen. The location will have most non-europeans heading for Google Maps or an Atlas, which is a good thing. Well cast with Michael York and other well known British actors, but to me the ""star"" is the small two masted sailboat around which much of the action occurs. In my view this is a must have for Britsh spy fans, ship lovers, or anyone who likes history. The only downside is the movie is somewhat slow for younger viewers, relying on character, dialog and location rather than action. A rainy afternoon, feet up, favorite beverage, and Enjoy!",1322179200,54,992,4.367567567567567

4586155,5,B00561BNJA,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS"" (1978) - (102 min/Color) -- Starring: Michael York, Jenny Agutter, Simon MacCorkindale, Alan Badel, Michael Sheard, Jurgen Anderson, Hans Meyer, Wolf Kahler, Olga Lowe

Directed by: Tony Maylam

British Invasion has returned to VCI, with this release from their vault.

Two British yachtsmen (Michael York and Simon MacCorkindale) stumble upon a German plot to invade the east coast of England in a flotilla of specially designed barges. They set out to thwart this terrible scheme, but must outwit not only the cream of the German Navy, but the feared Kaiser Wilhelm himself.  This has spy thriller written all over it.

This is a wonderful film, with scenic cinematography.  There is a sequence with fog and our lead characters are about to close in on the bad guys, the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Although in the book there were only male lead characters, but Jenny Agutter spices up the screenplay with a welcomed appearance.

The director achieves what the book was trying to convey, making this a classic with an outstanding cast.

Would like to add this is one of the most beautiful films from the UK during the 1970s, almost feel as if you're sailing away in this atmospheric tapestry with a colorful backdrop.

In these shifting sands, men can disappear without a trace...and their secrets with them.

4586156,3,B00561BNJA,"In 1901, Arthur Davies (Simon MacCorkindale) is a Foreign Office minion vacationing on the North Sea coast of Germany. He summons his diffident and clearly upper class co-worker, Charles Carruthers (Michael York) to join him in exploring the constantly-changing shores of the Frisian Islands. These quiet islands just happen to be near the entrance to Germany's main naval base.

After a series of mishaps befall them, Davies and Carruthers take a deeper interest in the secretive people they meet. For some strange reason, these Germans find the presence of the two foreign intelligence people -- complete with surveying instruments and charts -- to be somewhat troubling. Everyone seems to be curious about why they are there. What, Davies wonders, are they hiding? But that's the pot calling the kettle 'black.' If the situation was reversed, no one would hesitate to call two German 'diplomats' snooping around Scapa Flow
'spies.' But since they are the good guys, Davies and Carruthers must simply be a pair of unfairly scrutinized British tourists, who just happen to work for the forerunner of M.I.6.

Dollman, a mysterious man of power (Alan Badel) on the imposing yacht Medusa, seems to have contacts everywhere, even on the

German Navy's torpedo patrol ship, the Blitz. Dollman's fetching daughter Clara (Jenny Agutter) meets Davies and invites him to a dinner that turns into a blunt interrogation. After Carruthers arrives by train, the two snoop around the East Frisian countryside. Finally, the secret is out: Dollman is a British traitor with a nefarious scheme. Germany, the traditional ally of Britain, is preparing a top secret operation to sneak a German invasion force past the distracted Royal Navy. Oddly enough, everyone from the Kaiser on down seems to know all about the 'top secret' plan.

""The Riddle of the Sands"" was a sensation when it was published in 1902, but this certainly wasn't because of the writing. The book's place in history springs from the fact that it was the first modern spy story. It also marks the first time that Germany- rather than France or Russia - had been proposed as 'the enemy' of the British Empire, if only in popular fiction.

In time, Britain would join its two former enemies, France and Russia, in the Triple Entente against its former ally Germany in the First
World War. It could be argued that the diplomatic change started with this one influential book.",1455753600,,2423,5.017412935323383

Was years before I read Erskine Childer's eponymous book and learned his equally compelling story. His was a prescient tale and both Michael York and Simon MacCorkindale were perfect cast choices. I had not seen it in 30+ years and it did not disappoint. Still love it. Cinematography wonderful, music even more beautiful. It's a timeless film.

I read the book, which I loved. It was full of interesting nautical stuff and had absolutely no action at all. Everyone in it completely bourgeois. Terrific, very quaint.

4586165,5,B00561BNJA,"Superlative in all aspects, limited only by the plot of the book (see below). I love its classic 70s mise-en-scne (when the camera was the film) and its intimate portraiture of characters, mystery, and fear. The darkness in the bright sea and in the Teutonic coast surround the fools who attempt to brave it, or worse, are just curious. Watching it for the first time on 30 years was wonderful.

Like I said, while the film is perfect, I felt wanting at the end --- so much in the tale promises tragedy and sacrifice (for England!) but the author apparently didn't see the virtues of a tragic ending, which is ironic, considering his own ending. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Erskine_Childers.) One of the reasons for this empty feeling at the end is the theme song.

The theme song (and the musical mood in general) is actually better than the film, and I say that without slighting the film one bit. Howard Blakes Wagnerian theme song is one of the greatest compositions in film making history, adding more gravitas than the film delivered (i.e. not a tragedy). Which is why the ending, to my expectations, seems a little light and convenient. Sure, blame the musician.

(And the film could have changed the plot to have a death --- Ophelian if nothing else).

Written in 1903, the book followed a hundred other English spy novels of the Germanic Panic, so while its easy to say Wow, this is so prophetic of the Two World Wars (and it certainly is, in feeling if not in uniquity), it is not original.

And its always good to see Michael York and Jenny Agutter running around together! (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/).",1426032000,,1682,4.996428571428571

4586189,4,B00561BNJA,"A few things about the book the Riddle of the Sands before starting the review with the movie:
Erskine Childers author of the book is worthy of an action movie all to himself. In death he was shot by a British firing squad as a martyr to the Irish nationalist cause. As a novelist, this book is credited as having influenced British Royal Navy policy to the advantage of the British defense. A partial list of his activities would include British soldier (Boer war), Royal Navy intelligence service (WWI - Winner of the Distinguished Service Cross), arms smuggler, and yachtsman.

The book behind this movie is considered to be one of the first modern espionage books. In the Riddle of the Sands Childers would establish many of the elements that would influence the spy genre for decades to come. In the immediate years after this book was published it would inspire a number of look-alike books including a sequel by another author. About the only aspect of the modern spy novel not seen in Riddle of the Sands is a heavy emphasis on high tech gadgetry and huge expense accounts.

Now to the movie: Riddle of the Sands finds a relatively young Michael York and in a supporting role traveling out to join his friend amateur yachtsman author Davies, played by Simon McClorkindale. Simon is in need of backup because he believes he is on to a possible German scheme the exact dimensions of which he does not yet appreciate. The balance of the plot is dedicated to the process of discovering the details of the plot and then foiling it all before reporting it back to the British foreign office.

In terms of the history of the period, the movie is set in the early years after 1900. Germany has emerged as a modern nation and an industrial power. The British public had not yet come to understand that their command of the sea could be compromised by the upstart German Navy. More to the point, this was a time in the industrial revolution where the steam engine was king; and steel and iron are still competing.  Therefore this movie is an example of unintended steam punk. In a sense this is a steam punk espionage movie.

If your idea of an espionage movies includes high-speed chases super gadgetry and female cleavage this is not your movie. The pacingof this movie tends to be slow slow. If you're not a fan of yachting and the beauty of sailing ships, much of this movie will bore you. There are some great views of steam engines, gracious old railway carriages and period costumes. Acting throughout is largely low-key and natural and, perhaps this is my prejudice, very British.

I enjoyed this movie. To be fair - it appears that the slow pacing forced a rather abrupt ending. And while the movie generally follows and is true to the book the need to wrap it up seems to have caused the director to deviate from the book in order to produce a speedy ending. This is another case where the book should be read and appreciated on its own terms and the movie watched and enjoyed in its terms. It is understood that the comparison will as usual favor the book.",1357516800,5,3065,4.573770491803279

4586192,3,B00561BNJA,"This movie appears to be a labor of love for the director. There are many striking camera shots and beautiful boats to look at (almost distractingly so). The basic plot of the really excellent book on which it is based is retained, but with some unfortunate changes.

As I recall in the book, there's a long lead-in during which what is going on is a mystery to our sailor heroes. In the movie there's only a brief mystery before everybody pretty much knows the Germans have a plot to do mischief and what it might be. And then they had to throw in a female lead who serves only to resolve the mystery even faster.

These changes from the book water down the movie and you come away feeling like it could have been much better, much much better. But it is beautiful to look at and the acting is first rate.",1350518400,5,806,4.296052631578948

BUT I found something even better its, a DVD from Germany of the same story. 8hrs long!
The  title is 'Das Rtsel der Sandbank' this was some sort of German TV series from 1987 that has been issued as a 4 DVD movie. They are really into this sort of stuff, who knew! This is a perfect movie for a fan of the story. Unfortunately it's only available in German , no translation or subtitles. I sent a copy to my father he Immediately sat down for 8 hrs and watched the whole story even though he does not speak German! Drove my mother nuts but its such fun to watch what has been in your head for years. They did a really good job with making a period piece and trying to get the details right. The Dulcibella 'yacht' used is not as accurate as in the English movie but it's just the right sort of boat for the waters. The story is not a modern 'Block buster' so the movie is not either its a wonderful study of English doggedness and ingenuity. If you enjoy traditional sailing , a mystery and outdoor action all wrapped up in an accurate period piece this is it. You will need to watch in an unlocked all region DVD player and I had to buy it from Amazon Germany but its well worth it . warren

When it first appeared in the UK about 1904, it created a furor because it pointed up a major vulnerability of the British Navy's bases.  It led to a complete re-evaluation of the Navy's home fleet bases and the creation of the base at Scapa Flow.",1331942400,13,526,4.077669902912621

8459156,3,B00561BNJA,"The book from which this movie was taken is a classic by a man who is credited with starting three wars. He mostly did not start the second Boer War but he reported on it so he was associated with it in Britain. He died before a Free State firing squad in the Irish Civil War after being arrested with a concealed firearm. He had earlier been a figure in the Anglo-Irish War; he smuggled a load of rifles on his yacht, the Asgard, into Ireland from Germany, thus making possible the Rising of 1916. The third war he was said to have started was World War I which he precipitated by writing The Riddle of the Sands which depicted Germany as an enemy of and danger to, Britain. This film is a stodgy retelling of the tale from the stodgy book. Neither are anywhere near as exciting to modern sensibilities as the book was to the British public on original publication before WW I. But the movie is a depiction of small scale yachting in a time which will never come again which is not now to be better appreciated by any other means. Yachties should view it for all the period details of boats and dress and manners too.",1482796800,2,1118,4.303317535545023

I finally broke down and bought it, and now it's one of my favourites. Does start rather slow, but slowly cranks up until the plot is revealed and action starts. Excellent!",1480723200,,319,4.245901639344262

and an enjoyable way to spend an evening!",1456963200,,193,5.0625
8459162,5,B00561BNJA,"Great if relatively unknown movie. It is from Childers' novel, one of the first ""spy"" novels ever written, published at the the turn of the last century, so the pace and exposition is slower than a Bond movie. No pyro-technics. Fine story, good acting, beautiful photography, excellent score. If you are a sailor, it will instill an unquenchable desire for a Rippingille No. 3, but that is the chance you take.",1456358400,,410,4.788732394366197
