8233079,1,B000YJ44WC,"This movie looks as though it was made by a group of amateurs using a home-movie camera. It is amateur stuff with amateur acting. Somebody else has commented that he loved this movie but I suspect that he is a distributor for the film or has some other investment in it. If you've seen a lot of kung-fu films, you've already seen a lot of films that are much better made than this one. A bunch of kids wearing traditional costumes and acting (if you can call it that) out a poor script. You've already seen this film if you watch kung-fu and you've seen better versions. Skip it. Actually, instead of hating it, I moreso feel sorry for those appearing in it. Movie-making-wise, these people have a lot of growing up to do.",1379721600,,722,4.395522388059701
8233080,1,B000YJ44WC,"I think that this is a example of a kung fu movie gone wrong nothing works quality,content, and action very low I don't think that I could give this movie away to someone I don't like.",1368057600,,184,4.138888888888889
8233081,2,B000YJ44WC,"The movie has excellent setting and picturistic views of the landscape of Yunan province, but the story plot is too simple.",1325376000,,123,4.904761904761905

the story is great, acting of course could be better, but still...this is a huge step towards better and better Hmong Movies!

Definately worth buying!!!!",1214265600,,194,4.848484848484849
