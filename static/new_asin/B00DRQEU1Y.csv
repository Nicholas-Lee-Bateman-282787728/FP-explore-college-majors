5851415,4,B00DRQEU1Y,"""Shiver"" was an entertaining film with great performances by Danielle Harris and John ""wolf creek"" Jarratt.

I was thinking it was going to be a torture porn flick when in fact it was more of a thriller about a serial killer and the one that got away and away and away.the supporting cast was good as well co starring Casper Van Dien and the return of one of my favorites,Rae Dawn Chong whom I though could have been better utilzed.

The story moves quickly and kept my interest.there is some gore but not as much as I had anticipated. We have some decapitated heads which we never see during the act but we get plenty of heads in sacks, heads in formaldahyde and heads falling on the floor. There are some CGI blood spatter effects that I thought would have worked better old school style,but it was effective enough.

Harris really shines in this film and her acting has never been better,she was completely believable as Wendy Alden the pint sized object of ""the Griffin`s"" (thats what the killer calls himself) affection and abuse.

All in all it was a good thriller that kept you on your toes and I really liked the climax. I recommend it to Harris fans and lovers of the genre.",1381276800,7,1183,4.488372093023256
5851416,3,B00DRQEU1Y,"A timid secretary finds herself the object of the affections of a deranged serial killer who wants to either love her or else add her to his gruesome collection.

If you've seen Wolf Creek then you already know how terrifyingly good Australian actor John Jarratt is at playing a psychopathic killer. Now times that by ten. His portrayal of Francis Rood, a weird loner laughed at by women, is one of the most disturbing you are ever likely to see.  Rood handles his anger at rejection by creating a police taunting alter ego, The Griffin, and embarking on a spree of horrific murders, seemingly at random, all young women, home alone.  However, one manages to escape, for which she earns his respect - and his love. Danielle Harris turns in a powerful performance as Wendy, the girl who has to toughen up quick if she wants to stay alive.

The tension and gore factor are ramped up right from the word go, and the murders are brutal, relentless and unflinching, never sparing the audience. In Rood, we have a killer as clever and complex as Hannibal Lector and as unstoppable as Michael Myers. His moments of lucidity, the seemingly normal faade, and his warped attempts at engaging Wendy in conversation are chilling as they remind us that such people can and do live among us. The reveal of the full extent of his terrible depravity is an ingenious and truly macabre masterpiece of theatrical grand guignol.",1378857600,14,1408,4.711382113821138
5851417,1,B00DRQEU1Y,"A horrible and overly violent movie with bad acting.  I watched it only because it was filmed in Portland, I'm not a huge horror fan to begin with but even for the genre I would say it had an absurd amount of killing.
I would not recommend that anyone watch this for any reason, it was just bad in every way possible.",1413072000,,317,4.112903225806452
5851418,4,B00DRQEU1Y,"After reading these scathing reviews, I had my doubts on downloading this film. After watching it, my conclusion is I give it a B-.

The movie does depict some elements of the book, but not all. After all, very few movies these days follow exactly how it is depicted in either a comic book or an actual book. This movie has good acting, although Van Dien's was a C at best, his performance was the worst for me. Danielle delivered an excellent performance along with the villain, who was excellent.

Overall, I give this movie a B- for all it was worth, it is a watchable movie.",1412294400,,578,4.392523364485982
5851419,4,B00DRQEU1Y,"Being a huge fan of Danielle Harris, this film has been on my radar for some time. Despite some of the reviews I've read, this is actually a very good film, despite the budget. Danielle was top notch as usual (though I love her in even the less than stellar films she's done). The story was interesting and thrilling, and the performances were believable. I didn't find much of the film to be scary but it did build suspense very well. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this film to others. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I'd say it's certainly worth a watch. I for one will be adding this to my cart immediately.
3.5-4 STARS",1390694400,4,634,4.38135593220339
5851420,2,B00DRQEU1Y,"Time waster!!!! Much too, ""seen it all before and done so much better!"" How many naps can you put in one movie?",1387497600,,111,4.090909090909091
5851421,1,B00DRQEU1Y,"Having read the book I can say it was an excellent experience. However when the film was first announced I was skeptical at first. Having watched it I can say the film is a total disaster. Usually low budget films based on a book have at least one redeeming quality this had none.

Danielle Harris did little quality work on Wendy Alden (being a fan of her works pains me to say it) however she failed to bring this character alive and had no ability to connect with the audience.

Casper Van Dien was here for a paycheck only his work as Detective Sebastian Delgado lacked the qualities that the book described and turned the character into a carbon copy below average movie detective.

Had we stopped there the movie might have gotten a 2 or 3 as a below average b rated filck but NO bring up John Jarratt as Franklin Rood his performance destroyed this character. Instead of a serial killer that the population fear we are delivered a character that is so hard to believe he could do anything so complex as make a ham sandwich. His performance alone destroyed the movie.

Do yourself a favor buy the book over the movie.",1387238400,6,1123,4.463414634146342
5851422,2,B00DRQEU1Y,"Pretty cheesy movie.  I expected better given some of the actors but it was really just another cheap ""horror"" flick.  A one-time watch at best.",1386547200,2,144,4.72
5851423,3,B00DRQEU1Y,"""SHIVER"" is a horror movie based on the book written by Brian Harper. This adaptation was directed by Julian Richards & recently made its way to home video after circulating independent film festivals. Serial killer 'Rood' (John Jarratt) is perversely obsessed with women & turning him down only leads to their heads in jars, which is his ultimate collection. When he sets his sights on Wendy (Danielle Harris) he thinks he has finally found the one. In complete dreadful fear of her life, seeks refuge from the local Portland police. Their protection only goes so far & she is captured by her assailant & taken to his hideout. Here 'Rood' dissects 'Wendy's' psyche & viciously tortures her. All the while Wendy is hiding behind an insecure shadow that is masking her own level of brutality. SHIVER has received close to 20 awards & honorable mention at film fests. The downside for me was the lack of depth in the characters that were so detailed in the book. 3/5",1385683200,,964,4.744047619047619
5851424,2,B00DRQEU1Y,"Wendy (Danielle Harris) is pestered by a serial necrophiliac. To make matters worse Casper Van Dien is the detective on the case. The film is pretty much of a yawner. Nothing terribly graphic. The naked dead girl looks like a mannequin. The story was fairly straight forward and boring. Not worth a rental.

Parental Guide: F-word, C-word. Nudity?, near rape.",1382832000,,359,4.983333333333333
5851425,2,B00DRQEU1Y,"Well let me start off saying I really enjoyed Danielle Harris's performance. She did a great job. What surprised me is that Casper and Rae's acting was not very good. Rae's acting was very low energy and almost put me to sleep. What happened to the woman who starred with Arnold way back when when she was full of zest and energy. She made me feel like she didn't even want to be acting in this film. Casper's performance wasn't much better. Totally mis casted in this role. He was nowhere near as good as he was in Starship Troopers. His performance was boring and it appeared to me he didn't really know how a detective should act. Now here's my biggest problem with this film. Whoever casted the serial killer role should have their head examined or better yet quit and go to work selling hamburgers for McDonalds!!!. The actor and I use that term loosely looked like a 70 year old sterno bum that any 15 year old could beat up. He did not look the part and his acting was awful. Why anyone would cast him in this role is beyond me. The film itself was obviousally low budget and really no great surprises. Just something that has been done a million times before and this version was done poorly. I cant believe this got so many good reviews. The only thnig good was Danielle's acting. She really deserves to bbe cast in a big budget film. There is some depth to her acting. If you want to watch this film I'd wait until it comes to red box for $1.30
This review is simply my opinion. Thanks...",1381363200,2,1498,4.334519572953736
5851426,5,B00DRQEU1Y,"Well, I guess I can start off by saying that I can call myself one of Danielle Harris' biggest fans and I was waiting to see this movie since 2010!!! And now that I've finally seen it, all I can say is WOW!!!! It was different than any other movie that I've seen before which is good. And seeing Danielle play the role she played,(Wendy Alden) it weird cause it was the first kind of role that I've seen her in that's like a Sidney Prescott role!! Her acting was different, and the Wendy character was very different than anything I've seen her play in every way! Even though this killer is a human, cause I'm not scared of seeing a normal person coming at you or anything but the way the killer was and how good the actor did as the killer, was amazing and ACTUALLY CREEPY!! The whole movie was disturbing. haha! I loved it. I loved it very much and I can't help but give it 5 stars cause it was that good to me. lol! The only thing I could say about it, was that the dialogue was a little off. I mean, the lines seemed sometimes a little silly. But in the end, it was good. I guess I think it was off cause the story is based on the book. And lots of books have interesting and wonderfully over the top dialogue cause it's different than watching a movie cause you're reading the book! But so, I thought Danielle said the lines very well at least. haha! :)And I loved the ending. I was scared there was gonna be a stupid or a weird ending cause the recent movies I've seen, their endings are not satisfying. So, I was very pleased with the end. ;) If you are thinking of watching this movie for any reason like if you love Danielle Harris, WATCH IT!!!!! <3",1381276800,3,1658,4.168224299065421

8596780,1,B00DRQEU1Y,"How did this movie get made? Generic plot involving a serial killer that stalks the one who got away and is somehow 1000X more clever than the cops supposedly hunting him. The narrative is weak at best, no real reason I could see that he would think this one particular victim so special. But hey! There's Rae Dawn Chong! Haven't seen her in forever.",1428537600,,350,4.484375

8596782,5,B00DRQEU1Y,"I've not yet read the novel this is based on, but I'd very much like to.
This would have been terribly easy to overdo. The killer, Gryphon (John Jarratt) is so exaggerated, and the transformation of his ultimate victim, Wendy (Danielle Harris) is so extreme that it would have been easy to do this as a Quentin Tarantino type dark comedy with all the acting stylized. Nothing against Tarantino, but this story I think was much better served by director Julian Richards' more restrained and realistic approach.",1415318400,,509,4.862068965517241
