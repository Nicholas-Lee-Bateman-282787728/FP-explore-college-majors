1393024,5,B0000541V7,I agree with Merlino.  I keep looking for this in DVD (and I already have the video).  It is outstanding--too classic not to be on DVD.,1137801600,,135,4.153846153846154
1393025,5,B0000541V7,"I bought this movie on VHS a few years back, and was hoping that it would eventually be released on DVD. I was in Spain, and saw the DVD version there. The DVD version has scenes that are not on the VHS version and not to mention the option of watching the movie in Spanish!! I really would like to buy the DVD version of this movie that can be played in North America! This movie is very faithful to the spirit of the original book it came from. People who are familiar with this masterpiece of Cervantes and anyone who just likes a good story will be happy with this movie. I highly recommend it!",1124064000,30,598,4.163793103448276
1393026,5,B0000541V7,"I have just seen this movie and it was absolutly brilliant. The scenery, the actors the story which is pretty similar to the original Servantes book. John Lithgow is fabulous as the don, sometimes funny, sometimes very serious and sometimas extremely shy. You cannot help but listen to him and you belive him more than the family who tell that the don has only dreams. When the prince and his wife (the beautiful - just like her mother - Isabella) make fun of him, you can really hate them and want to help Quijote and Pansa. John Lithgow has played not just with his body but with his eyes too. His eyes. At the end he has pratically no lines he just look at us and it is perfect. It was a beautiful story with a talented, real actors. Don't miss is if you like films that touch you heart and soul. I give 5+1 stars.",1104019200,14,817,4.243589743589744
1393027,3,B0000541V7,"Although I found this film to be light and enjoyable, I would have to disagree with anyone who claims that it is ""quite true to the book.""  True, it follows an outline of the most basic plot, but do not buy into the idea that seeing this movie is anything like reading Cervantes' original work.  A lot is left out, both in the extensive storyline and in the complexity of the characters.  It is also set in a time period approximately two hundred years after the original book was written.

That said, this is still a delightful movie in its own right.  I beg you, however, not to believe that this is an accurate representation of the novel.",1102982400,13,642,4.406779661016949
1393028,5,B0000541V7,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT! This movie is one of the few movies that actually stick to the book, with only a few minor changes! The movie is about Alonso Quixada, an old gentleman who loves reading about chivalry. The books of chivalry change his mind, so he escapes from his home to become a knight-errant, despite his niece and housekeeper's pleas to keep him at home. Alonso, who has renamed hisself Don Quixote de la Mancha, takes Sancho Panza, his neighbor, as a squire. Together, Don Quixote on his horse and Sancho Panza jauntily riding on his donkey, encounter many adventures. For example, once, Don Quixote mistakes windmills to be giants. When he rushes towards the ""giant"" and is about to strike ""the giant,"" despite Sancho's saying that it is just a windmill, his breath is knocked out of him. When he sees that the giant is really a windmill, he blames and curses the ""great magician 'Malfatto'"" who is really made up in his mind. While this is happening, Quixote's friends, the curate and the barber, his niece, and his housekeeper seek for ways to make Quixote realize his foolishness. The curate enlists the help of his nephew, Sampson Currasco, to help him cure Don Quixote of his foolishness. Sampson sets out to find Don Quixote and bring him back to his senses. The first time, he pretends to be a knight and tries to win a joust with him. However, Sampson loses. After Don Quixote wins, he sets out for the palace of the Duke and Duchess. There, he is entertained by them. However, he is merely a joke to them. The Duke and Duchess play many jokes on them. One day, the ""knight of the mirrors,"" Sampson Currasco, demands to have a joust with Don Quixote. The terms are that if Quixote loses, he will have to return to his hometown and have no more adventures. However, if Quixote wins, the ""knight of the mirrors's"" fate is in his hands. This time, Sampson wins, and Don Quixote returns to his hometown. There, he lives until he dies peacefully.

 The casting of this movie was great. All the actors protrayed the characters very well. John Lithgow was very able in protraying Don Quixote, and so was Bob Hoskins as the potbellied Sancho Panza. I must say that Amelia Warner as Don Quixote's niece was my favorite character. Amelia's beauty and heartfelt acting really made a spark to her character.

 All in all, I give this movie a 10+. This movie is really one of the best, and I liked the fact that it sticked to the book really well. Enjoy the movie!",1090713600,14,2481,4.556053811659193
1393029,5,B0000541V7,"Ok so the book is better and a lot longer, but this is one rare care where the movie was as good as the book and John Lithgrow is prefect in this role. The filming is great and the setting are wonderful, the only thing I would change is to make in widescreen, but as for a made for TV movie they don't get much better. I would like to see this on DVD with all the extras, but for now the VHS will do. Well worth the money and well worth the time it thats to watch it, a great film for the entire family and those are hard to find. Both young and old well enjoy this film as it full of the adventures of the ever imagitive Quixote and his stead fast loyal and saine sidekick.",988675200,7,674,3.856115107913669
1393040,3,B0000541V7,"Bob Hoskins was perfect as Sancho Pancha, that was the best with the film. But having read the book, I was disapponited for all the stories that were left out.
Missed English subtitles very much.",1371513600,,195,4.6
1393041,5,B0000541V7,"Wonderful! A delightful rendition.  The story line differs from the book, but works very well in this beautifully done film.",1360368000,,124,5.2
1393042,1,B0000541V7,This is the second DVD I am unable to play.  I will not purchase Region 2 items in the future.  I want to send this back.,1355443200,,121,3.6153846153846154
1393043,5,B0000541V7,"I will start with a digression:  Though the book was published in two parts, the first in 1605 and the second in 1615, the story is by nature episodic and some episodes may have been published in the 1500's in periodicals.  In Spain, as with most of Europe, these misadventures were the source of much derisive laughter and even disdain for the knight.  The author encouraged this attitude -- at least in the beginning.  Cervantes noticed his readers' reactions and noticed his imitators who wrote their own episodes for the knight-errant.  He may have thought that the readers are missing part of this.  I'm sure he thought his imitators were humiliating the knight far too much.  This is supported by the second part of the book where the author has apparently changed in his view -- in fact their might be a slight hint of admiration for Uncle Alonso.  There is the charm!  Could this character have changed or even educated his own author?  You decide.  End digression.

  An ageing Spanish gentleman, Alonso Quixano, has an extreme fondness for books of chivalry.  He read books of chivalry every waking hour.  He liked them.  He thought about them.  Then he acted on them.  He sold some land for funding and went to see his neighbor Sancho Panza, a peasant.  After some prodding he was able to talk Sancho into being his squire and accompanying him on a quest.  Alonso would change his name to Don Quixote de La Mancha, a knight-errant.

  First on the list is getting knighted.  After all, one cannot knight oneself.  This will be quite a task since the last knight in Spain was at least 120 years earlier and the feudal system has relaxed a bit since the eleventh century.  However Uncle Alonso gets knighted as easily and quickly as if it was done every Saturday morning at the local convenience store.

  They have barely begun their journey, and not knighted yet, when they come upon some giants blocking their way.  The noble knight immediately charges on faithful Rocinante, his horse, with lance lowered toward the villains.  Of course the giants are really windmills and the arms are really the blades of the windmill.  The lance is caught in one of the windmill blades and the knight is taken high in the air.  ...Well, I can't tell whole story can I.

  The scenery and sets are beautiful and the cast is first rate.  The ending is very close to the book.  The book's ending is not like Man of La Mancha, the musical.  That's all I can say about it or you'll hate me.  Keep in mind that this is a founding work of Western Literature and one of the first novels.  Cervantes was about seventeen years older than Shakespeare.  Jousting anyone?

A small suggestion, question, or both.  Why in the world isn't this on DVD region 1 ?!?! ...or Blu-Ray region A ?!?!",1317859200,3,2775,4.607802874743326
1393044,4,B0000541V7,"This is a visually sumptious film which treats its central characters with a gentle quirky humour that never completely destroys their dignity and humanity. It is an almost impossible task to reduce Cervantes classic novel to film, but I doubt if there will be a better attempt. The success is primarily due to the outstanding performances of John Lithgow as the Don and Bob Hoskins as Pancho Sanza and John Mortimer's script. Lithgow's Don has a dignified strength which balances his over active imagination while Hoskins tongue in cheek interpretation owes much to the human weaknesses that so many of us share. It took a little while for the film to gain pace but as compensation this adult production had an imaginative energy that brought to mind Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and a Midsummer Night's Dream-it was indeed a good ""Knight's"" entertainment! Not for the action film addict but willingly suspend your disbelief and connive with its reality as the Duke eventually did and you will certainly enjoy.",1259193600,4,1010,5.053892215568863
1393045,3,B0000541V7,I am so glad to have a version of Don Quixote that my English 12 students might enjoy.  Last year all I could find was the cartoon version.,1258502400,,139,3.9642857142857144
1393046,3,B0000541V7,"A really elite cast with Bob Hoskins as Sancha Panza - can't get any better than that unless Akim Tamiroff is still around - a charismatic performance by Lithgow with other great actors in the supporting roles and a very good director (Peter Yates) attached to the project. BUT - the special effects are really cheap and hurt the project bad. I mean really bad. The attack on the windmills was great but as he ventures on a magical horse ride and visits magical kingdoms....yikes!!

That aside, it's funny and enjoyable and the enthusiasm of the cast really does come out. My biggest complaint story wise is the ending. I had just read the book and wanted to watch the film and was shocked at the alternations to the ending. I really wanted to feel for Don Quixote at the end but instead I felt the film tried to redeem a lot of the characters at the end when Cervantes was obviously trying very hard to emphasize the betrayal or deception of Quixote's closest friends which brings on the characters melancholy and of course his broken heart as this cruel modern world contains no place for chivalry and 'Knight-errantry'. I could only see the hand of the producer demanding the story be fit for a modern audience who wishes everyone to live happily ever after...",1253836800,3,1263,4.613333333333333
1393047,2,B0000541V7,"The movie is reasonably made and it somewhat sticks to the original story.  However, the casting of Vanessa Williams as Dulcinea is wrong.  Dulcinea was a Spaniard from La Mancha in the city of El Toboso.  99.9% of Spaniards are white, mostly with dark hair but light to olive skin and fine facial features.  Vanessa Williams is a mulata (a mix of white and african black).  The Cervantes story originates in the 15th century (around the time of Christopher Columbus' Discovery).  The mulatos did not come into being until the 17th century and much more in the 19th century and later.  This was when the Black African slaves mixed with the European (French, British, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese) whites.  Therefore, this is like picking Tom Hanks to play Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his biographical movie. Anglos need to stop inproperly labeling ""hispanics"" and learn a little bit of history, anthropology and sociology.",1213747200,,923,4.9869281045751634
1393048,5,B0000541V7,"This film does an amazingly good job of balancing the humor (or should I write ""humour""?) of the novel with the serious themes.  The settings seem very authentic, and the English phrasing of the lines is impeccable.  It takes a mature viewer to appreciate the film throughout, as just viewing it for entertainment value (instead of for reflection) will have you tiring of the theme at several spots.  I think that if Cervantes were a film-maker, this is what he would have given us!",1209513600,,482,4.714285714285714
1393049,1,B0000541V7,"This movie completely misses the mark. Notwithstanding the assurances of other reviewers, it does not adhere to Cervantes' story. The instances of deviation are far too numerous to mention in spite of the fact that I was unable to watch beyond the 32nd minute. (The speeding automobile in the background almost forced me to stop even sooner.) It is apparent that these reviewers have either not read the book or have forgotten the details.

To begin with, John Lithgow's performance is condescending and farcical. He behaves like a buffoon. A close reading of Cervantes suggests that Alonso Quijano is respected and taken seriously by his friends, niece, servant, and neighbors. Even though errant knighthood is a thing of the past in his time, deference - however grudging - toward the nobility is not. In this movie, though he is addressed with respect by those he encounters, he is too readily taken for a fool. The book makes it clear that Don Quixote, in spite of his delusions, preserves his characteristic gravity and noble bearing. His interlocutors are, for the most part, inclined to believe and respect him until his excesses refute their initial bemusement. This sequence of reflexive trust followed by sudden realization is part of what makes the book so funny. On the other hand, the erudition that is the cause of the gentleman's mental and physical divagations makes possible his beautiful ""Golden Age"" speech, delivered to goatherds who are perhaps too pastoral to conclude that something is terribly wrong with their guest. Similarly, his madness does not keep him from discerning the essential truth of Marcela's defense, unlike his simple companions who continue to berate her. Lithgow is unable to bring any of this complexity to life. The role called for someone like the late Richard Harris, who could have provided the seriousness, capriciousness, and labored determination it requires.

As for Cervantes' Sancho Panza, he is so in awe of his master's self-professed greatness that he allows ambition and admiration to subvert clear evidence of the nobleman's insanity. To use an example that few readers seem to proceed beyond - though it takes place very early on - Sancho's faith allows him to dismiss Don Quixote's attack on the windmills as failed perception, not delusion. His goal of seeing himself governor of an island has hardly been dealt a blow. Bob Hoskins' rendition, on the other hand, does not convince us that any of this is going on in the squire's mind. He seems too sly for the role of a faithful rustic.

I wish I could say that this is at least harmless entertainment, but it's not. If you watch this without having first read the book, you are likely to come away wondering what all the fuss is about, and believing that notions of what constitutes humor invariably go out of style - so Chaplinesque is Lithgow's performance. I have not been able to make up my mind as to whether Don Quixote or Hamlet is the greatest story ever told, but had I not read either, Zeffirelli's Hamlet would have encouraged me to read the play, whereas this production, which is barely an improvement on Three Amigos, would persuade me that my time could be better spent.",1205539200,11,3198,4.8966789667896675
