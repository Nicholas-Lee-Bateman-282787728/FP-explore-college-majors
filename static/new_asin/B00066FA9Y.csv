The characters, buildings and vehicles could belong in the 70s or early 80s. Only later did it dawn on me that the story takes place during the tough Argentine economic crisis of the late 90s and early 00s. The film shares a visual look with some early Scorcese work, although its social theme is perhaps more reminiscent of the Italian neorealist films of the 40s and 50s.

Crane World also reminds me a bit of Five Easy Pieces, with Jack Nicholson, which also deals with a sensitive musician who puts his music aside in order to work in construction (even if the circumstances surrounding their main characters are very different). Unlike Robert Dupea (Nicholson's role in Five Easy Pieces), Crane World's Rulo has a beautiful sense of humor and doesn't take himself terribly seriously. He's a dreamer confronted by reality, but also an every day man navigating life as fluidly as he can. As the going gets tough, he makes an effort to keep his chin up and find serenity within his struggle.

The film doesn't provide big explosions or fireworks. It's a quiet and very elegant piece of work. What consistently amazes about it from start to finish is how natural and spontaneous it feels. One might as well be watching a documentary or be dreaming.

Unfortunately for non-Spanish speakers, some of the magic will be lost in translation. Much of the melody comes from the Argentine dialogue that the actors produce so effortlessly.

Still, there's no good reason to miss this touchingly eloquent jewel. I can only wonder why it's not better known.",1318204800,,1660,4.855123674911661
