6474774,5,B00L8QP0C8,"My two and four year old LOVE this movie.  We are just getting into the Barbie movies and after seeing this i'm willing to let them watch more, which is saying a lot as I didn't want them to watch any.  We especially loved the music and silly dances.  It was a great movie to watch and dance with together!",1410912000,,306,4.066666666666666
6474775,5,B00L8QP0C8,My kids loved this movie so much.,1410912000,,33,3.857142857142857
6474776,4,B00L8QP0C8,"I purchased the movie today and watched it and honestly it was a lot better than I expected it to be. I would probably give it 7/10. The songs are pretty cheesy, bland and random (to me) but the story line is cute. The main villain though is kinda irritating to me, but for a kids movie  I guess it makes sense the way Mattel made her. I think children will really enjoy this movie! I would give it a try and the moral of the story is a good lesson for young children as well! To believe in yourself and take a chance even though you might afraid to do something like given a speech in class, or to let your true colors shine. So all in all, Id recommended this movie. :)",1410825600,9,671,4.007462686567164
6474777,5,B00L8QP0C8,"My 12 year old and 7 year old girls both enjoyed this one!  Very fun!  They especially enjoyed the villain in this one.  ( Even their 13 year old brother watched part of it and declared... that was pretty good! ).  My guys love the older Barbie movies...princesses, fairies, and mermaids.  Well Barbie combined them all this time along with some modern style.  It worked.  My girls have watched it twice in one weekend.  Must be good!!!",1410652800,4,436,4.571428571428571
6474778,3,B00L8QP0C8,"I'm a bit dissapointed with this film. It clearly was targeted for the 4-8 year old range. The villain was a spoiled 7 year old princess. Really? Mattel you can do better. I know barbie films are intended for younger audiences but I still expected better. They seemed to have reused a bunch of the characters/costumes from the other movies. Delancey's yellow formal gown in Princess Charm School, Princess Tori's hair and face design, just to name a few. I wish they still made their movies like ""The Princess and the Pauper,"" or the Nutcracker film. I guess oldies really are goldies even if they aren't thaat old. Not sure you want to spend 80 minutes watching this.",1410566400,8,668,4.669491525423729

6474780,4,B00L8QP0C8,"I'm nine and a half years old and this is my opinion on Barbie and the Secret Door.  This movie is one of the best Barbie movies I've ever seen. Not like in some barbie movies, the main character isn't named Barbie. I mean, no offense of course but  Barbie "" isn't exactly a real name. Next, I love how the main character shows her loyalty to her friends. There's also some funny moments in the beginning which I like. At the part where it's almost the end something really unexpected happens which is also a little funny and strange. The moral to this movie is that you can't do anything if you don't try, and even though I know that already, it's fun to see other people learn it in such a fantastic way. I also want to note that the coloring is beautiful.
I was going to give this four and a half stars, but I can't seem to figure out how to do the  half  thing. The only problem is that buying HD and the SD are the same price! ( at least for amazon instant video ) And that means paying 14.99$ for SD. I'd say that's a pretty high price. Even though I'm a kid, I still care about that.

Other than that, this is a great movie.",1409788800,74,1131,4.053811659192825
6474781,5,B00L8QP0C8,"Good messaging. Hardly a boy in the movie...and he does do any saving! And, the choreographed dances are pretty funny for an adult but mesmerizing for a kid!",1409788800,11,157,4.642857142857143

Some of the dancing is too much for me. The villian is a little girl who steals people's magic. We probably won't watch it again.",1513728000,,270,3.9272727272727272

6474875,4,B00L8QP0C8,"In this musical shy and awkward Princess Alexa prefers reading books in the garden to balls and parties but one day her book opens a secret doorway to a magical land.  There she encounters fairies, mermaids and unicorns but discovers their magical powers are being stolen by the wicked Princess Malucia.  Now Alexa must out smart Malucia and save the kingdom!

Our twin toddlers (age 4) love Barbie videos.  And while they might love them as a grown up I find these videos are terrible, mediocre at best.  So it was a pleasant surprise to find this one that's a cut above.  The music is tolerable, clever even at times and the story has a bit more depth than the usual stuff.  The villain is a spoiled greedy brat of a girl and I was especially happy to see that Alexa outsmarts Malucia rather than defeating her with luck or power.  I also liked that Alexa was more flawed than the normal Barbie character.

So I'd recommend this over the other Barbie fairy and mermaid videos.",1499299200,,978,4.511363636363637
6474876,3,B00L8QP0C8,"We have two little girls, and I have resisted Barbie for so long, but could not deny them any longer. This is actually a fairly sweet story about a shy princess who finds a magical world with the help of her grandmother. There Barbie helps her new found friends fight to take back their magical land.

I had avoided Barbie thinking there would be a ""mean girl"" element or that the Ken/prince character would always have to save Barbie. Nothing of the kind. At least in this installment of the zillion movies available, no prince/Ken like character even appears until the last five minutes and only after Barbie has made great friends, and she and her girls have saved themselves. Very obviously computer generated animation, but not bad. Music isn't terribly annoying. All in all, a pleasant surprise.",1497916800,,801,4.804347826086956

The villain is a spoiled brat which gave my daughter a great example of how NOT to act because no one likes a villain.

6475082,5,B00L8QP0C8,"I bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loved it. I liked the innocence of the message. The magic kingdom is populated with fairies, mermaids, unicorns, and various creatures. When Aladdin is mentioned, the mermaid asks what is a magic carpet and what is a boy? There isn't the romantic push that there is in Disney movies. The prince appears briefly at the ball in the end and when Barbie's mother suggests she dance with him, instead Barbie dances a hip hop dance routine with her friends. The Grandmother ends up dancing with the prince. I really liked the minor role of the grandmother. She is the one who initially gives the magic book to Barbie (a book lover.) The ""villain"" in the movie is a spoiled greedy indulged little girl. I considered this a good thing for the movie. Some recent animated villains are too extreme in my opinion.

6475121,5,B00L8QP0C8,"After the disappointing, weak films such as Barbie: A Fashion Fairy Tale, Barbie: A Fairy Secret, The Princess and The Popstar, and Barbie in A Mermaid Tale, I was really glad that things were finally picking up pace with Barbie in The Pink Shoes, and going back to their original Fairy/Princesses stories in which I think the Mattel Company excels in best. Her other films that came after Barbie in The Pink Shoes were good, but this one just struck out like a sore thumb to me. The movie is like a combination of Barbie in The Pink Shoes, Fairytopia, Mermaidia, My Little Pony, Alice in Wonderland, and CandyLand all wrapped into one with an ironic twist. With the antagonist in the film, I was expecting an old age, evil woman which I typically see in other Barbie fairytale movies, but the Mattel company had really step up their game this time by making the antagonist a spoiled, manipulative, zany, quirky young child instead.  She is basically the Angelica Pickles of the film who wants to steal all the powers from the unicorns, mermaids, and fairies. Princess Alexa, who is pretty much like me, is shy around people and doubts her capabilities. Once she puts her fears aside, she was so wise and smart enough to give Malucia all of her powers that were more than what Malucia could handle. It blew right back to Malucia's face and all the stolen magical powers were restored to the land. That was wise, quick thinking that I probably would have never thought of that myself. What makes this film also different from the rest of the Barbie films is the lack of presence of males in the magical world. I got a kick out of it when one of the characters asked Princess Alexa ""What's a boy?"". Also, Princess Alexa's lack of interest in dancing with the Prince at the end of the movie. Wow, can you really imagine a world without men? We women would probably be ""one happy, fat women"" just like the character Khadijah had once said in one episode of Living Single. Going back to the film, we see that Malucia's parents had returned to the kingdom after a vacation. Instead of the parents punishing Malucia for her selfish, greedy behavior and trying to take over the kingdom yet AGAIN, they would rather lavish her with more gifts. One can assume that her parents are to blame for Malucia's bratty, spoiled behavior.",1441670400,,2319,4.601449275362318

In this movie, Barbie plays a princess who doesn't really want the responsibility of being a princess. She would rather read books all day. One day she begins reading a book that magically leads her to a magic door. She walks through the door to face an adventure of finding one's true self and courage.

First let me say how much I love the music, especially ""I've Got Magic"".  I really like the magical feel this movie has when Alexa goes through the door and enters a whole new world.  You can't help but love Nori and Romi (especially when Nori is voiced by my favorite voice actress, Ashleigh Ball!) and the comedy throughout the film.  I could totally relate with Alexa.  That's another thing this movie has - good character development.  Sure Malucia is annoying at times, but what villian isn't?  The acting is great, the visuals look smashing on Blu-ray, and as I mentioned before, the music will have you singing along. Overall, it is a must-see movie.

6475543,5,B00L8QP0C8,"This was our introduction to the Barbie movies, which honestly I had always passed over assuming they would be low quality animation and vapid storylines.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well made this movie is. The animation has bright colors and more realistic movements than previous Barbie efforts. The heroine has a beautiful face, but she is also humble, smart, loves to read, wants to help, and discovers her courage, making her a positive role model. It made me chuckle how tailor-made this film is crafted for young girls.  They threw in everything:  princesses, fairies, mermaids, unicorns, and a candy colored world.  It was like a Lisa Frank illustration come to life.

I liked that the villain of the story was not too scary - which makes this great for younger audiences.  Some of the other Barbie films have really evil villains who are plotting murder. This villain, Melusha, is a spoiled child who is mean and stealing magic. I was able to discuss Melusha's actions with my daughter and why she is naughty (not sharing, stealing, name-calling, mean attitude).

Finally, the songs in this film are great. It's really mostly two songs, sung multiple times with different lyrics. However, they're catchy pop and add to the film. We liked them so much we also purchased the soundtrack, so my daughter now enjoys dancing, singing and role playing the movie.",1421539200,,1372,4.913419913419913

6475634,1,B00L8QP0C8,"I had fears this movie would be sort of bad. And granted I'm too old to probably appreciate these movies anymore, but I really question what the movie creators were thinking! The music is awkward. The choreography horrendous. And the storyline? Yeah, what storyline again??? It was filled with endless disappointment. The main heroine is just a cowardly girl, oh sorry I mean a ""shy princess"" who wishes she could dance properly and be outgoing, all the while she spins and sings and does a perfect arabesque in public. Wait what? And then she finds a magical door leading to the world of horrible backgrounds leftover from fairytopia. Then she meets silly friend #1 and slightly smart friend #2.  And they are introduced with HORRIBLE dancing  and singing. I'm not sure what happened to being graceful, but apparently dancing like Flemingos is ""in"" now. And that somehow begins the pointless plot that sadly I couldn't even make half way through, so I skipped to the end.  But even the conclusion didn't seem satisfying in the slightest considering the villian was given no real consequences.

Go buy an older barbie movie. Those are great! I can't even see the targeted audience sitting through all that crazy-yet-dull rolled into one THING they tried to call a plot.",1419984000,,1269,4.888372093023256

Barbie and The Secret Door has the character of Princess Alexa wanting to explore different avenues of dancing and other creative outlets outside of what is usually expected of her. However, Princess Alexa gets a gift that is better than she expected when her grandmother gifts her with a book that activates her imagination and helps transport her into another fascinating world. The World is filled with much brightness, happiness, and the highly magical inhabitants appear to enjoy playing outside in nature a lot (I noticed various flower symbols). However, there is a girl living in that kingdom that lives in a good house and wants for very little. However, she does not want to leave the inhabitants alone and wants to kidnap them to harness their magic not realizing that the most powerful magic has to come from within her.",1418342400,,995,4.852941176470588

6475708,4,B00L8QP0C8,"My granddaughter loves all things having to do with a princess. She has the Alexa doll from this set, and the DVD came with the doll. Barbie has come a long way. This is a more sensitive, insecure doll, and she shows insight and intelligence in her growth.

Barbie opens a Secret Door after she has become a shy, bookworm. Her parents and friends are unable to get her out of her room for any length of time. She does take dancing lessons and that is not successful. It is not until a wise grandmother gives her the right book to read,that Alexa, dares to tempt her fate. Alexa finds the secret door  and her world opens to the magic of her life. She does not understand she has magic powers until the dreaded troll, Malucia, comes to steal all the magic in the land. Alexa intercedes, and becomes a more self confident young princess. She assists her friends, and we hope all is well in this land.

There is a good mix of music, some pop but something for everyone. This is a Barbie movie by another name, and I found it enjoyable. It was fun for my five year old granddaughter, and her grandmother. The gowns were beautiful, the set was gorgeous, the storyline was well done. Nothing too scary or off putting. This is the kind of film most 5 year old girls would enjoy. A really nice film that grown ups would appreciate.

6475712,1,B00L8QP0C8,"I used to think I was a good parent.  I also thought I had raised a kind, sweet, and loving child.  'Barbie and The Secret Door' taught me otherwise.  I cannot comprehend why any child would want to inflict this on their family, except possibly as some passive-aggressive form of vengeance.  This movie exposed us to horrible, nightmarish visions of madness and mind-warping chaos that left us broken, empty shells of the people we once were.  Every moment of this film is an explosion of garish neon color that is overwhelming in its blinding intensity.  Watching this is like experiencing HP Lovecraft's Celephais, a nonsensical dreamworld of cerulean landscapes and bright pink delirium, all set to the depraved music of insane Gods.  I can only imagine this is what LSD feels like, although this movie is far less enjoyable.  The biggest surprise of all came during the credit sequence:  I was stunned and a little horrified to discover that this movie was made by actual human beings;  People who I presume had hopes and dreams and feelings much like my own.  Somehow, these people not only crafted this mind-twisting horror but then, seeing what they had wrought, chose to unleash their creation upon the world.  Why would any allegedly loving God allow such a thing to exist?  What strange sort of madness drove a person to author such a work?  And why does my child insist on inflicting it upon us?  It is too late for us, but I implore you to save yourselves while there is still time!",1416355200,5,1494,4.714285714285714

6475718,5,B00L8QP0C8,"This movie is a delight! Older Barbie movie fans will enjoy it for the whimsical fantasy, and newer Barbie movie fans will enjoy it for the good lesson and moments of friendship. I enjoy it for both! The story is about the shy Princess Alexa, who would rather stay at home and read than socialize. When she finds a magical door to the world of Zinnia, Alexa must rise to the challenge alongside Nori and Romy, a fairy and mermaid who had their magic taken from them by the wicked, spoiled Princess Malucia. Alexa learns to believe in herself as she works to defeat Malucia and save the entire land's magic.

The movie is GORGOUS! The world of Zinnia is one of the most engaging fantasy words I've seen recently. it incorporates many spirals in its design and is a candy-colored treat for the eyes! I must have taken 100 screencaps of just the magical world! If you're looking for a colorful adventure with catchy songs and a lot of heart and fun, watch this movie for sure! A highlight is Malucia's villain song, ""I Want It All.""",1415836800,,1029,4.473404255319149

It comes off a bit goofy in some area but then I realized I'm not really the targeted audience and the one who the movie was intended for is watching this movie somewhat quietly (ok, not really) from start to finish...so it's a winner.

Only a small part of the message was about relying on herself. My 7 year old started whining about how she wishes she had magic, and life would be so much easier.

I wish the message was more about her growing and less about her using magic. One song is ""If I had magic"" another is ""Now I have magic""",1413331200,8,469,4.043010752688172

My four year old held her hands over her ears when the princess would use unkind words.

I wasn't a huge fan of the Babie and the Pink Shoe either, but this makes that actually look great. And at the end the little bratty kid causing all the problems her parents come home and reward her with more stuff? Really spoiling her even more.

6475824,5,B00L8QP0C8,"Barbie opens a Secret Door to a wonderful world of magic, music and friendship!
This time around, Barbie stars as Alexa, a shy princess who'd rather immerse herself in books and fantasy than face her royal duties. Soon her understanding grandmother gives her a magical book that opens up a secret door in her garden, leading to a magical world of fairies, mermaids and unicorns like the ones in her books. But this vivid and seemingly idyllic world has one major problem; a spoiled ruler named Malucia who is determined to steal all the magic in the land for herself.

When Alexa arrives, most of the inhabitants have already been robbed of their magic; leaving Alexa as one of the few who still have certain inherent powers. As such, she is able to help her new friends face Malucia and get their own magic back.

Barbie and the Secret Door is filled with many fun new characters; but my favorite is Malucia, who brings a fresh spin to the usual Barbie villainess. She enjoys her villainy; even putting it to music which accounts for the best and most cleverly written song in the movie. She is also very cunning; seldom missing an opportunity to get more power (with little opposition from her amusingly oblivious parents who make a brief appearance at the end).

The rest of the songs are the kind of pop songs you tend to get in the newer Barbie movies; not exactly showstoppers but harmless enough  if you're into that kind of sound and don't mind that the lyrics don't exactly rhyme (a common trait these days). I prefer the more traditional music of the older Barbie's but still, none of this bogs down the spirit of the movie or diminishes its five star rating from me.

The underlying theme of the movie is that ""You never know what you can do unless you try,"" which is nicely illustrated as Alexa realizes her own potential and uses it to help her new friends. One of my favorite scenes is when Alexa has an opportunity to go home and escape Malucia's growing threat, but elects to stay out of loyalty to her friends and saving their world.

All this culminates in a triumphant finish after which Alexa finally does return to her own world, bringing with her a new outlook and openness to new things; realizing a potential she didn't even know she had.

While some of these themes can be obvious, contrived and largely overdone in movies these days, this movie doesn't seem to suffer from it. It's just highly entertaining, artistic and fun for the whole family. I recommend it!",1410998400,20,2488,4.59009009009009
