1219739,5,B00000IC7G,Solondz has figured out how to make the audience laugh hard and then feel guilty about it later.  No other movie has left me in such a confused and affected state.  Amazing.,925171200,2,173,4.375
1219740,1,B00000IC7G,"Is there an American director who hates sex more than Todd Solondz? In every subplot in this film, sex is always the bad guy, the thing terrorizing the middle class. If your picture of modern life is a series of  bad lays, then I guess this is your ticket. Personally, I thought the  picture  lacked depth and character, and seemed more intent on shock than  sense.",923270400,6,365,4.484848484848484

1219742,5,B00000IC7G,"Happiness finds those little cracks in our collective fear of happiness and rips them open. It's not afraid to dive into the most pathetic souls and find at the center of it - fear of happiness, or acceptance, or love.  Most people are gripped by fear and build very small worlds for themselves,  and this wonderful film explores those fears completely. Granted, there are  two scenes in the film that I question the need for, but the overall is  great filmmaking. I applaud the forward stance and udder lack of Hollywood  ""Happiness"". It's a brave film and refreshing to experience.",922147200,2,583,4.79

1219802,1,B00000IC7G,"Watched with a movie group. I can see the quality of the acting. Clearly a great cast. I can even see the ""point"" of the movie. It gave something to talk about/discuss briefly. I just did not enjoy this movie at all. It is not my thing to be disgusted and uncomfortable for 3+ hours. Everything that the director/producer/writer wanted to say could have been said in a shorter movie too... it really dragged out which increased everyone's level of discomfort - of course this was intentional but UGH.

A lot of the movie was shocking and interesting, however, child molestation holds nothing entertaining or funny in my book.

1219886,5,B00000IC7G,"Amazing film from the late nineties that certainly deserves a more competent release.  My comments are referring to the 2004 Lions Gate DVD release.  To start things off the film has been cut!  Yes, and i'm surprised I haven't seen anyone else bringing this up.  Original release runtime 139 min,  2004 edition sports a run time of 134 min.  I'll tell you exactly where the cut came.  At the end of the film the whole family is sitting at a table and they are discussing their life situations.  In the original cut of the film this conversion piece goes on for a much longer time.  In particular, the situation concerning the pedophile father and the fallout from those events was omitted from the current 134 min cut.  Sad to see this film get trimmed for whatever reason.  And come on Lionsgate,  2004 and you present this film in a non-anamorphic , messed up aspect ratio!!!  So sad!  Criterion where are you! THIS FILM DESERVES BETTER",1473379200,,938,4.606060606060606

1219894,4,B00000IC7G,"This movie has an interesting cast of amazing actors and actresses.

I loved Louise Lasser (who had played Mary Hartman) as the grandmother.

The title of this movie is sarcasm.  Every character in this movie is a miserable, messed-up misfit, either pretending to be happy or searching for happiness.

This movie held my interest because of the constant shocking scenes.  The writers of this movie had the guts to show scenes that most movies would never show.  Like the expression - ""Don't even go there"" - this movie goes there.

The last scene made me laugh because it was so sickly sad and powerful.  Among several other things, the grandfather had been to the doctor, believing that there was something seriously wrong with him, but he was simply very depressed, and his doctor told him that he was very healthy and he just needed to stay away from salt, so, in the last scene, the grandfather sprinkles a lot of salt onto his food.",1458864000,2,937,4.670731707317073

1219979,4,B00000IC7G,"This was great! The simple storyline compliments the tension which permeates the entire film and does nothing to betray the complexity of the characters' inner lives. Good acting; Jane Adams is adorable as always, Lara F Boyle was hilarious, Dylan Baker and his perpetual frown were both particularly compelling, and of course PSH was amazing as he never failed to be in any role (the heavy breathing was a clever touch). The soundtrack was perfect. As far as the story itself goes, there's no real resolution to any of the mess that the characters were enmeshed in. Their problems existed before the plot began and went on long after it ended. They were miserable, narcissistic people who were too preoccupied with all the wrong things to ever achieve real and lasting happiness. Sad, ironic, funny, and disturbing.

I searched Phillip Seymore Hoffman movies until I found it since I didn't even know the title. It was the first time I had ever seen one of his movies and was amazed at how great of an actor he was in it. I don't know much about the rest of the movie, but make sure you keep your eyes and brain open for his meeting with Laura Flynn Boyle after his obscene
 phone call to her. His acting is amazing! I bought the DVD just to see and own that small part again! Just like with Chaplin; spoken words are not necessary.

1220028,4,B00000IC7G,"Far too often moviegoers are subjected to a blatant exaggeration of raw violence, murder, rape, sex, nudity, racism, and a myriad of criminal activities and human blight.  Moviegoers love it when a false hero blows up a car full of bad people and their heads go flying everywhere.
Yet, these same folks watch an original movie such as Happiness and they are all of a sudden sickened by the roles, scenes, and subject matter.  I get it.  Really, I do.  Pedophilia is not a subject anyone should be comfortable about.  Its a hideous and disgusting condition, but it undoubtedly exists in our society.

Please understand, in no way, am I advocating pedophilia by liking this movie.  I too was grossed out and repulsed by the subject matter.  However, unlike most movies, Happiness is not glorifying anything here.  It is simply telling you an original story of authentic characters going through the same everyday conditions we all struggle through whether we like it or not.  All anyone has to do these days is to turn on the local news channel to discover how messed up our world truly is.  What you see on the news is what you're seeing in Happiness- so don't be surprised and disgusted when see reality for what it is.

And movies should be an escape from all that.  That is why Im only giving Happiness 4 stars.  It is not an escape- it is a shameless reminder of how insane life can be, how dysfunctional our families are, and how even the best relationships have their monsters in the closet.  However, this movie, for all its dark and demented scenes shares some fleeting moments of hilarity!  Yes, it is funny.  That is, if you have an open mind.

And there it is- if you have an open mind, youll like or love this film.  If you dont, youll trash this film and think its stupid.  Just remember- when you watch that next film and you're not turned off by all the violence and sexual content, then you should be ashamed and not so judgmental.",1424390400,2,1946,4.537356321839081

Or that the actors and characters were believable. I watched the whole thing trying to finish it by the end I was so disgusted with the writer for humanizing these monsters. My ocular cavities have been molested and if I could I would burn this dvd mob style in the streets. Mind you I am not religious, I am an art historian and trained to appreciate all forms of art like ""Piss Christ."" I was never molested or raped, but this is how our society is getting worse and worse. EXPOSURE = ACCEPTANCE.

1220139,4,B00000IC7G,"Ill just start by saying that Happiness is completely messed up.

I honestly don't know what else to say.  This kind of reminds me of what Paul Thomas Andersons Magnolia would have been like had it not been so entirely self-indulgent, and then again I wonder if some of that self-indulgence is what made Magnolia so memorable.  While Happiness is similar in tones and some themes, the film has an air of nonchalance that Magnolia never had.  Magnolia took itself VERY seriously, whereas Happiness is far more laid back and tries to come from a more humorous angle, even when dealing with situations that are far from funny.

The main themes here have to do with sexual perversions, pedophilia, loneliness, masturbation and physiological abuse.

This is a tapestry film, much like Magnolia was, and covers the lives of seemingly normal people who are all hiding something that makes them less than happy.  Joy Jordan, a lonely woman with no real life to hold onto, opens the film by breaking Andy Kornbluths heart, and then suffers the consequence for the remainder of the film when he commits suicide.  Her sisters are both just as messed up, but in less obvious ways.  Helen is popular and famous and yet suffers serious insecurities and self-doubt that she keeps hidden from the world.  She is also being, sort of, stalked by Allen, her boorish neighbor with some sick fantasies.  Trish is the sister who seems to have it all together.  Her husband Bill is a successful therapist (who also sees Allen) and she has a nice house and two healthy boys, but her eldest son Billy is having some puberty problems and Bill is harboring a really dark secret that comes out and destroys Trishs world (and the world of quite a few other people).

But its not like these three women had great role models, as their parents are separating and causing quite a ripple in the family.

There is a very light air about the film, which I think in the end lessens the impact.  This can be seen as a plus (for it never feels indulgent) and yet also a detriment (because this material should affect us more), but the film should be praised for attempting to cover such serious ground without feeling stereotypical or preachy.  The ensemble is also to be commended, for they really went all out here.  The late (I hate saying this) Philip Seymour Hoffman buries into the soul of this man with such force, and he leaves a sad note in our hearts.  But really, this is all about Dylan Baker, who had such a  rough task at hand.  This man is repulsive and yet he had to play both sides, creating a monster but giving him a soul and playing up his rouse.  He does it brilliantly.

My personal reaction goes a little beyond what I normally feel when someone has made understandable behavior that typically one might shrink from. It might get close to the matter at hand to say this is about the use and abuse of the sex drive in modern, baggies using society. Might also approach this with the idea that these folk are not riding the horse, it is riding them. This is drama (or comedy), set in a society where 'sex sells everything, sex kills', and people must face loneliness.

1220200,3,B00000IC7G,"Happiness is a 1998 dark comedy film written and directed by Todd Solondz. It stars Cynthia Stevenson, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Jane Adams as the three Jordan sisters Trish, Helen, and Joy, respectively, as well as Dylan Baker as Trish's husband Bill, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Helen's creepy neighbor Allen. This film reminded me a lot of a similar film which coincidentally also starred Philip Seymour Hoffman called Magnolia, a Paul Thomas Anderson film which was released a year later. Both films feature ensemble casts which are all related/connected in some way, and also feature thoroughly miserable, depraved, angry, and unlikable characters. Happiness at times felt like it was going for pure shock value, or rather, that it was trying to hard to be shocking and controversial. It seems as if the director Todd Solondz, who is also responsible for a much better, but still dark film which I enjoyed called Welcome to the Dollhouse, simply went out of his way to be as dark, vulgar, and offensive as possible, for no reason other than to be shocking. He didn't seem like he was trying to make any profound messages or insights into the reality of damaged characters like the ones in this film. I guess the closest theme one can take from this film is that even people and places that outwardly seem happy and idyllic can in reality but incredibly tragic and well, unhappy, for want of a better word. Bill Maplewood, who's probably the most messed up character in the film, outwardly seems like a relatively pleasant, if not a tad boring, man, but in reality he's a very sick, twisted pedophile who suffers from deranged fantasies and compulsions.
While it is true that there are people like this, a few notable serial killers are proof enough, I still feel that this film, although certainly funny at times, was an empty, black abyss of pain and suffering that would have been much better if it had more light and less darkness, it seems that there are far too many films, books, and TV shows that instead of trying to be simply entertaining, or intelligent, insightful looks into the human condition, instead go for the easy route out and be as dark and offensive as possible with little to no redeeming social merit. This film gets three stars because although I didn't particularly like it, I did sympathize with some of the characters, particularly Joy, and while I certainly felt guilty doing it, I did laugh alot. At the end of the day, this film is still a comedy, and it succeeded in doing what it set out to do.",1361145600,,2529,4.711060948081264

1220204,5,B00000IC7G,"At first you don't know what to expect. You know the cast is good. Philip Seymour Hoffman. Jon Lovitz. Lara Flynn-Boyle. Ben Gazzara. Anybody who has seen 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' knows filmmaker Todd Solondz likes to explore the social boredom of alienated suburbanites and expose their darkest perversions hidden under a false outer shell. In this regard, 'Happiness' is no exception and definitely the pinnacle of Solondz' ""suburban pervert"" vision. The movie starts off with an argument in a restaurant between a man and a woman (Lovitz and Jane Adams) and takes a left down a fork in the road to the weird. It's like a train-wreck playing on repeat that you cannot stop watching. Controversial themes such as pedophilia, child-rape, voyeurism, loneliness, sexual harassment-via-phone, yadda ya...it's all here for you to feast your eyes on. Most of it is ugly.

But let's be real here --- this film is brilliant! From the writing, acting, screenplay, musical score, its utterly magnificent. Yup, Solondz struck a lot of nerves with people on this one.

1220246,3,B00000IC7G,"Never before has a film addressed ""coming of age"" quite so literally.

This is a dark, dark comedy: the sort of thing that might emanate from the deepest circle of the hell of Woody Allen's nightmares. The titular happiness, in case you were wondering, is colossally ironic. This is a story of loosely related individuals - more loosely related than you'd expect given most relations are of the blood or marital sort - all of whom are profoundly at odds with themselves and their environment. Much of their collected oddness manifests itself in sexual dysfunction of one sort or another, but of a far deeper and sicker kind than is commonly found in Woody Allen's material. Indeed, by comparison Allen's neuroticism seems positively winsome.

These people are deeply, darkly, fatally neurotic: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who seems to revel in these kinds of parts, an overweight, greasy, bespectacled misogynist who has unspeakable fantasies, fantasies which he nonetheless brazenly speaks about, to his shrink and to his victims, through inept crank calls. His shrink Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) is a paedophile. Maplewood is married to Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) a woman whose hi-tensile smugness betrays a fundamental insecurity about her place in the world. Trish doesn't know of, but we suspect she may fear for, her husband's ghastly proclivities. Trish has two sisters who, in turn, field Allen's crank calls, and seem to enjoy them. The sisters' parents, holed up in a Florida condo, see their Marriage as a loveless contractual bind.

In the middle of it all is a teenaged boy, Timmy (Justin Elvin), Trish and Bill's son, who is fruitlessly willing on the onset of his own puberty, providing his father a running commentary. His father darkly enjoys.

Could the set-up be any more neurotic?

The narrative gradually displaces itself from early focus on Allen towards the Bill, at which point whatever tacky residue of humour the film had retained is jettisoned and we are let into the paedophile's modus operandi. From there, for thirty minutes, Happiness is unrelentingly grim. Relief comes in the form of the travails of the third sister Joy (Jane Adams), a chronically frustrated spinster, who has stumbled into the arms of a Russian taxi driver (Jared Harris), whom we are invited to like for his uncluttered and direct approach to life, but who also turns out to be a monstrous pig.

The film has as its climax a harrowing exchange between Timmy and his father, now exposed as a paedophile, in which Timmy interrogates Bill about his sexual proclivities and his father answers him calmly and directly. It really is a striking sequence, but as with much of the film, it is thoroughly contrived.

These characters are archetypes we recognise as being profoundly American. Had the film been located anywhere else, the screenplay could would have seemed utterly implausible: you just can't imagine Europeans, let alone anyone else, being this self-involved.

Black humour returns at a stroke in the final scene, in a scene which will have you bent over in mirth or nausea depending on your, well, taste for such things. It seems a little bit of a cheap shot, though that's clearly not how Timmy will have felt about it.

1220248,5,B00000IC7G,"""Happiness"" is without a doubt a sick piece of film. It will shock you, depress you, disturb you, and profoundly affect you in all kinds of emotional ways. This film is misunderstood because most people don't realize that this is a black/dark comedy in disguise. The film is hard to watch, but at the same time you HAVE to keep watching. The plot is really just a group of people acting absolutely loathsome towards each other and/or going through extremely distressing drama. The characters consist of a pedophile, a sexually frustrated pervert, a young boy who is drugged and raped, a completely depressed and lonely woman whose emotions are trampled throughout the film, and a sexually curious pre-teen asking every embarrassing question about sex you could possibly conceive a child asking (and beyond), among others. The filmmakers obviously have a lot of animosity towards people, and life in general. So, if you watch this film, be warned: absolutely ADULTS ONLY!! And, I'd say only watch this if you can handle very disturbing sexual and/or violent content. The acting is great, the script is really good, and the content is totally engrossing. There are NO special features here, so only buy this if you like the film, or don't care about special features. I would recommend getting sick and twisted one night and popping it in, if you have the moxie. And if you do, make sure you stay tuned until the very end, when we are shown what I call, ""the money shot"". 4.5 stars.",1300406400,2,1480,4.807843137254902

Well, it is the meanest movie ever but that is far from a good thing; the film is so misanthropic that it just becomes silly. Solondz's attitude toward the characters feels almost like he's just bullying them, making them be at their worst 100% of the time, building entire characters just around ""dark little secrets"", and making just about every male character who isn't suicidal or a child a rapist (not kidding). However it is paced all right, but is completely average visually. The music, when not by the film's composer, is great sometimes (Thanks, Todd, I never would have found that Vivaldi concerto otherwise!), but the film's score is so painfully ironic. Happy music under overbearingly sad or morally questionable things, sad music under normal things. The acting is sometimes good. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jane Adams are the only ones who are at all interesting; everyone else is an annoying ridiculous caricature. People call this film ""real"" but that's far from true, it is exactly a zany mainstream comedy, just played more serious, with worse people (people are not that horrible in real life). Put Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler or whoever in this instead of Hoffman and Dylan Baker and it could be a full-on-comedy.

this film will disturb you.  its central focus is the lives of three sisters (and, to a secondary extent, their parents) - and the title of the film is really antithetical to its overall mood.  these people all pursue happiness ... some of them are even fooled into thinking they have found it ... but none of them are truly able to grasp it, with the possible exception of one character.

what makes this film so controversial, and why so many people hate it, is because it follows the story of bill maplewood.  maplewood has a successful career, a lovely home in a nice neighborhood, a devoted wife, and two sons.  he clearly loves his children.  maplewood has one of the ugliest skeletons in his closet a person could possibly contain - an insatiable appetite for boys his eldest sons' age.  over the course of the film, he rapes 2 children.  these scenes are NEVER directly filmed, merely implied.  there is one scene (i don't want to spoil it) that is simultaneously unspeakably gruesome and utterly heartbreaking.

the people who hate this film - they hate it because they don't want to face this reality. they hate it because, in my opinion, they don't want to think of pedophiles as human beings. but bill maplewood, for all his faults, for the evil things he does, IS a human being.  he goes to such great lengths to try to protect his son... but he can't , and you see him collapse because of it.

it is a dark, disturbing film.  you'll laugh at times; you'll cringe at times, sensing inevitable fallout; but often, too, you will sit before the screen enrapt, unhappy on a soul-deep level at some of the uglier scenes that unfold.

The movie is much more that just a pedophile, however interesting that most reviews are written on that scene. Once again we shock people and clearly that is what we focus on. The intertwining relationships of real life trauma is accurate. Funny? Not. So what was the entertainment value? What was the message? Shocl us that real life has bad people, that hurt others. That real love is rarely found. That we should not get caught up in our own hubris.

Shocking the public WILL NOT improve any victims or make us anymore aware of the atrocities of pedophiles. The extreme method of drugging the children was over the top. Less than two percent of pedophiles medicate the victims. Oh well, nice try. Was this movie just satisfying somones morbid curiosity?

1220277,4,B00000IC7G,"In HAPPINESS, everyone is either getting abused, or doing the abusing. Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), the main character if there is one, is the primary receptacle of abuse either in her obvious relationships with men, or her subtle relationships with her own family. She is a fledgling songwriter, who wistfully sings about a ""happiness"" that doesn't exist in director Todd Solondz' dysfunctional world. Other denizens of this world are her sister Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) who deludes herself into thinking she has a wonderful marriage and family, her other sister Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) a self loathing and cynical writer, Trish's husband Bill (Dylan Baker) a psychiatrist and covert pedophile who drugs and rapes his son's friend and schoolmate, and one of his patients, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a shy neighbor of Helen's who fantasizes about brutally raping her and gets his rocks off making lewd phone calls. There are also Joy's parents (Ben Gazzara and Louise Lasser), and an overweight, psychotic tenant (Camryn Mannheim) in Helen and Allen's building..but I won't elaborate on them.

HAPPINESS is not a happy movie, although there is a load of very dark humor in it. Like Woody Allen, Todd Solondz uses film as an artistic medium to express neuroses, and exorcize personal demons, but where Woody's milieu is urban, Todd's is suburban, and where Woody won't cross certain lines in exploring mankind's dark nature, Todd has no reservation about crossing those lines and venturing into forbidden territory. With the exception of Larry Clark's work the topic of pedophilia has never been treated as openly and boldly as in HAPPINESS. Bill's final conversation with his son is totally unnerving and makes you squirm in your seat.

I will recommend this film, but with reservations. It is artfully done, well acted, and with enough sharp dialog and humor to keep you engaged for it's 2 plus hour length. However, it's viewpoint is too pessimistic for my taste, and Todd Solondz needed to do a better job filtering out what is funny, from what is truly offensive.",1237766400,2,2069,5.08235294117647

Although people like this do exist, to find them all existing together on the screen in an intersecting mess is unbearable. I am not sure of even what this films aim was. While art itself does not need a reason of course, a film still should at least be watchable and enjoyable on some level, even if only to communicate other kinds of people that the film viewer may be unaware of. Usually there is someone in the film for the viewer to relate to, a character that arcs, a mildly satisfying ending, an attempt at making some aspect of the film worth the torture one may see. This had none of that. Since I love films and tend to watch films many times. I could no sit through this mess again. It was the most depressing and awkwardly compiled collection of societies fringe.

The dialouge delivered in the film is unique and somewhat racy but that's what makes the film intiurging.

If jokes depend on the fact that they're offensive, that probably means the overall foundation is pretty shaky.  I was amazed to see how big of an impact this film made on most people.  It just proves that most people haven't considered all sides of things and when something taboo is presented in a comedic form many people are quick to call it ""brilliant"".  If anything, I wasn't so much offended by the film as I was by the people whose outlook on humanity was exposed to be wishy-washy and corrupt by their reaction to the film.  But then again, I think that was part of Mr. Solondz's agenda.  He has contempt for the audience, and he wants them to BE guilty, not FEEL guilty.  He wants to prove through the intended audience reaction that humanity is corrupt and that we turn our backs on our fellow man at the drop of a hat.  As for me, I was just sickened by the fact that a rare opportunity to tell a harrowing story was wasted on predictable attempts at humor and manipulation.

1220336,1,B00000IC7G,"There was a time -- I'm sure you remember it -- when we were in Junior High/Middle School, and someone would say the word 'penis' and we would all either smirk, or chuckle, or burst out laughing.

It didn't matter what the context was... could've been a discussion of the Holocaust, and we still would've found it funny.

On reflection and in some measure of greater maturity, there's nothing really funny about the word 'penis', but Middle Schoolers (and perhaps some adults) will always think it so. In that same way, a movie like Happiness will always draw a fair amount of admiration from some, just for the fact that it touches (or, actually, dwells) on dysfunction and such taboo subjects as pederasty. In many peoples' minds, this alone will be enough to make Happiness ""daring"" or have some other merit. They will love it because it goes where other movies don't. And... there *is* something to be said for that, but just as the word 'penis' doesn't make the Holocaust actually funny, depicting pederasty doesn't make this a good movie.

Happiness is a tedious film. It is tedious from its opening scene to its final credits. It uses its ""shocking"" subject matter, questionable characters and tawdry situations to distract us from the fact that it does not, at heart, have a whole lot to say. And, that's a shame, because if you're going to bother to do so much to draw people's notice, you might as well do something useful with it once acquired. Instead, the movie closes on roughly the same notes as that with which it opened -- the characters are no more enlightened at the end about their situations than are we.

The casting is brilliant -- Philip Seymore Hoffman, Jon Lovitz, Cameryn Manheim along with a host of strong character actors -- but they don't get a chance to truly move the audience. Am I supposed to be rooting for Hoffman's character? Against it? Do I really have any reason to care about him, or any of the others that drift through the screenplay like flotsam?

To sum this up, the movie Happiness is basically the equivalent of an ethical freak show. Some claim that there is educational value to be found in a carnival's side show -- just as some will claim that there is something of worth, here -- but really it's just there to provide a shock to the system. Happiness is as relevant as a geek biting the heads off of chickens, and draws praise because it is irreverent, not because it is quality.

The opening scene is sooo hilarious, thanks to Jon Lovitz's performance. He has such a great line when he's telling Joy she's horrible, ""You're s***, I'm champagne."" And the whole family dynamic and how it's thrown up in hte air and turned upside down. The stereotypical nuclear family with a pedophile as a father, drugging his family to have his way with his son's friend. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is tremendous, he's the epitamy of pathetic. A charachter so boring even his therapist zones out on his session thinking of what he needs from the market. Being so frightend to talk to the beautiful woman next door, but calls her obsessivly. It has such a great cast, even the kids in the film are good. I find that every Solondz flick has good child actors, who could forget Heather Matterazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse.

Yet I do not want to pretend that this film didn't disgust me. I am not easily shocked believe it or not (and I don't expect anyone to but it is the truth) but this film is simply to much. I really do see the point in a general way of taking on such distasteful topics but this film does so with a casual depavity thats is disturbing to say the least. Really this film seems less concerned with adressing these topics in the serious way they should be and more concerned with simply shocking the viewer as much as possible.
 I realize some call it daring and groundbreaking but I don't agree,there is a difference between ground breaking and just trying to make the sickest film you can for its own sake. Ultimately after watching this movie I found myself feeling very depressed and deciding I never wanted to watch this garbage ever again.
 Happiness stars Dylan Baker as Dr. Bill Maplewood a sick beast of a man that dreams of murdering people and having sex with young boys and is broadly speaking about a trio of sisters and those around them including Cynthia Stevenson as his wife trying to believe all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,Lara Flynn Boyle as an author not very satisfied with her success and facinated by the man that keeps making obscene phone calls to her(Philp Seymore Hoffman) who is also a patient of Dr. Maplewood and Jane Adams as a teacher who seems to go threw one humilation after another.
 There is a nastiness to this film that really comes off as gratudious and there in lay the problem(well one problem really as there are many with this movie)the film making,the sheer,raw shock seems very forced and gives the film a contrived feeling. The director seems far more concerned with in your face shocks then anything else. It may look as if he is trying to hide that with the somehow casual atmosphere that lurks on the surface of the movie but that to is deeply contrived as you sit threw one depraved act after another. For example were not one but 2 scenes of shooting semen really so important to include?Also one cannot help but get the impression the film maker is subtly trying to show at least some sympathy for Dylan Bakers sick child molester and if anything thats the most disturbing thing of all about this movie as it goes without saying the charcter is not remotely deserving of sympathy.
 The idea of adressing the topics Happiness does is not a bad one per say but not like this,this film wears its intent on its sleeve and beats you over the head with vile acts. In the end for all the claims of it being a ground breaking and daring movie the film wallows in depravity far to much and ends up defeating its own purpose,it does not break taboo's,or open dialogue about subjects people rarely discuss,it simply disgusts and horrifies.",1201564800,3,2946,4.5633270321361055
1220339,3,B00000IC7G,"Wow. This is THE most disturbing film that I have ever seen in my life. I've seen a few Solondz films, and they're pretty twisted on their own terms, but this was flat out sick. It's as if Solondz solely set out to shock, disturb, and disgust...but you know, there are people like this out in the world, and these situations need to be dealt with and confronted. This film is merely a window into a part of our world that is pitch black, a world filled with characters who are all looking for happiness, yet find none. They're all going around in circles. With all of that being said, I can tell you that now that I've seen this film, I have no desire to see it again. It's going to be hard for me to recommend this to anyone, especially any of my friends, but if I had to recommend it at all, it would be for the sheer power of the film, the emotions that it pulls out of you, and last but not least, the performances. Every one of them is superb. Dylan Baker has the toughest role as a seemingly perfect father of three who just happens to be a pedophile on the side. He is a monster, yet Solondz never lets us forget that he is sick and wrestling with some pretty serious demons. It was hard for me to sympathize with this character, and I'm sure that many will understand why.

The rest of the characters are just as conflicted, except for maybe one...a character named Joy. She's a bright shining light in this film, and you keep watching, wondering if she'll ever find the true happiness that she is both looking for and deserves.

I give the film three stars because at times, as I mentioned before, it seems as though Solondz just wants to rub your face in ugliness for the sake of it. There were times when I was infuriated because of that, but for the most part, like the films ""Blue Velvet"" and ""American Beauty"", the film is an expose of the darker side of suburbia.

And I will not be watching this one again any time soon! Watch at your own risk! This one is only for the brave...",1200096000,,1994,4.228346456692913
1220340,5,B00000IC7G,"Happiness is one of those rare films that takes a look at lives that are so often ""hidden"" from public view. It seems that just about everyone in this movie has serious personal problems; and the film gives us a frank and often brutally honest view of troubled lives.

There are several main characters in the film whose lives all intertwine to some degree. There's Mona and Lenny Jordan (Louise Lasser and Ben Gazzara) whose marriage is coming apart after 40 years of togetherness; and we see their three daughters Trish Maplewood, Joy Jordan and Helen Jordan (Cynthia Stevenson, Jane Adams and Lara Flynn Boyle, respectively). Trish has no idea that her husband Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) likes little boys way too much as he supports his family by being, of all things, a psychiatrist.

In addition, we also meet Allan (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Allan is frustrated for lack of a woman in his life so he makes lewd crank phone calls to women. We also meet the Maplewood's two sons, Billy and Timmy. Look for some particularly fine acting from Rufus Read who plays Billy Maplewood.

As the film progresses, we see all of these people trying to find happiness. Although they try to make emotional connections with other people they fail. Allan can't do any better than a woman with a rather grisly little secret; and Mona cracks up when Lenny, her husband of forty years, leaves her for ""no one"" and the one time we see Lenny with another woman he complains that he feels ""nothing."" Of course, trouble looms over the Maplewood household as Bill Maplewood tries desperately to hide his pedophilia from his family. It doesn't help that the love life has faded out of the Maplewood marriage.

Suffice it to say that the plots and subplots take many interesting turns along the way; and although the subject matter can definitely be disturbing few people who do choose to watch or buy this movie will ever switch it off before the ending. Actually, there is one person who does achieve a degree of happiness at the very ending of the movie--but I'll leave out the specifics so you can experience that for yourself.

The DVD comes with pitifully few extras. Instead of a few commentaries and some extra deleted scenes, we get little more than scene selection and a ""filmography"" for five of the actors in the movie. A disappointment for sure!

Overall, this excellent movie is for a crowd that's not exactly squeamish. Happiness eagerly delves into deeply disturbing yet all too real problems society faces every day--and when the movie ends you feel better off for having watched it. One reviewer wrote that they felt like ""a fly on the wall;"" and I think that's the effect director Todd Solondz wanted to create.

Happiness shows us a ""slice of life"" with several types of characters that are not normally main characters in films; and there are many plot diversions to add extra spice to the overall plot.

I highly recommend this film.",1195171200,10,2936,4.754420432220039

Hoffman is particularly repulsive--brilliantly so--as Allen, an unkempt, antisocial shut-in who compulsively plays with himself and confesses his sick fantasies to Baker's equally perverted Bill, a shrink with pedophilic urges who Solondz somehow makes pitiable in a harrowing, heartbreaking scene with his son. Also outstanding is Adams, a shrinking violet incapable of malice and always at the butt end of petty brutalities. Behind every faade of normality, Solondz seems to be saying, lurk the dark impulses that actually define who we are- or could be. Definitely not for the squeamish or those easily offended.",1184198400,2,827,5.624
1220372,5,B00000IC7G,"This one will knock your socks off even if you aren't wearing any socks.  I dare you to watch it.  I double-dare you.

But first a few words.  This is about sex.  Not your Cinderella meets Prince Charming sex.  Not your boy meets girls sex at all, or not exactly.  This is more like REAL sex, the kind you don't talk about.  This is about several varieties of sex, most of them perverted or deviant and/or illegal in most states.  And this is about ""happiness"" in only the most ironic sense of the word.

Yet, somehow this movie seems...well, not uplifting, heaven forbid, but somehow reassuring in a strange way.  I guess what happens is that after all the perversions, the hang-ups, the unrequited desires, the bizarro fantasies, the unnatural desires, the depraved acts, the exploitation, the sheer desperation of the biological imperative, somehow with the family sitting around the dinner table at the end, somehow we are reassured that life not only goes on, but things could be worse.

It is interesting that director Todd Solondz--who previously gave us the captivating and totally original Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995), a strikingly truthful look at the middle child in junior high school--spun this out the way he did.  The story is really about three sisters and their parents and the dysfunctional sex that they encounter and the pitiable/ normal lives they live. Solondz could have begun with having us meet the sisters one by one like some kind of chick flick with the expectation that we will find out about their lives and their loves.  Instead he starts from another angle, and only gradually does it develop that this really IS about their lives and loves.

Well, their lives and loves are a bit beyond kinky or pathetic, and yet they are so very like the lives and loves so many people lead--if only we knew.  By the way, at times the film is belly laugh funny.

Starring are Jane Adams (Joy), Lara Flynn Boyle (Helen), and Cynthia Stevenson (Trish) as the three sisters.  Joy is the wallflower at the dance of life, Helen is the hard as a stiletto woman of fashion, accomplishment and beauty who can't find the right man, and Trish is the desperate housewife ""happily"" married to a man who is a homosexual pedophile and a psychiatrist.  Dylan Baker plays the shrink who can't help himself in a way that makes it tough for the audience not to identify with his problem.  He is so honest with his son and so clearly loves his son and his wife that we are almost won over.  Almost.  We do NOT see him with the boys he exploits, and in this way perhaps Solondz has stacked the deck.  Still a movie that paints a pedophile in anything close to a positive light deserves credit for courage if nothing else.

The other characters who are anything but sympathetic in an objective assessment--one is a murderer--somehow come across as being vulnerable instead of monstrous.  Perhaps Joy, who is so hopeful and so very, very vulnerable, is the one who most inspires our sympathy.  The Russian who frankly admits he's a thief and exploits Joy seems more despicable than anyone in the film.  Perhaps.  I think it really depends on your point of view, your sexuality and perhaps your individual experience.

Ben Gazzara is the father who is just sick of his wife, and Louise Lasser (whom I haven't seen since she starred in the offbeat TV sit com ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" from the seventies) plays the wife.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a guy who is terrified of performing with women, but gets his jollies dialing strangers on the phone and talking dirty.  Camryn Manheim plays the large woman who wants intimacy but finds sex disgusting.

I think you've got the picture.  This is sexual dysfunction as TV's Lifetime would never have it.  Solondz's intent seems to be to demonstrate the truth of the adage ""To know all is to forgive all.""  He also does a good job of showing that although we think we are the self that makes the decisions, maybe it is true that our biology overrides our intentions.

This is decidedly not for the straightlaced or the intolerant.  This the sort of movie that is so terrifying to social conservatives that they won't even attack it for fear that such an attack would only give it greater currency.

See this for Todd Solondz who is a film maker of verve and insight, a humanist who is not afraid to shock the bourgeoisie.",1180137600,2,4370,4.6640522875817
1220373,5,B00000IC7G,"Some people see the world as an awful place.  Some people see the world as a funny place.  Todd Solondz, director of Happiness, sees the validity in both points of view.  For him, the world is an awfully funny place.  And in this bleak comic masterpiece, Solondz shows us how to find hope in the most despairing of circumstances, dignity in the face of shame, and compassion in the face of one's most monstrous acts.  In other words, Solondz shows us what humanity really is, and isn't that - at its basest level - what filmmaking is supposed to be?

""Happiness"" is also the best movie that Robert Altman never made, in that it is a mosaic of the masses, interspersing a loose narrative thread through the disparate lives of many without seeming disjointed.  It essentially follows the lives and disfunctional loves of five characters through a myriad of morbid situations, some stemming from deterministic outside pressures, most a result of the characters' inner turbulence churning to the surface through misguided thought and deed.

At the supposed center of the conflicts is a pedophilic psychiatrist (Dylan Baker) who preys on the peers of his adolescent son.  A monstrous act, indeed, but the camera's unflinching objectivity serves to neither condone or condemn the man, so we are left to see the struggle amidst the strife, the human within the monster.

Other characters include an unlucky-in-everything hapless spinstress named Joy (ha ha) who allows the world to treat her like a welcome mat placed in front of a door to better things.  Her sanctimonious sister, Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), while seeming to have it all, secretly wallows in the emptiness of her hollow life.  Lara Flynn Boyle plays still another sadistic sibling, a famous writer who wishes that she were raped, so as to provide a more authentic muse.

And though simple verbal descriptions of these characters make them sound ghastly, in thought and indeed, the magic of the film is the even-handed well-weighted treatment that they receive through Solondz' direction and the actors' depictions, letting the audience decide whether empathy is in order.  Too many people in our society have a need to characterize aberrant and abhorrent behavior as coming from an ""other"" - someone less than human and thus tangibly different from them.  The truth, of course, is that we are all people who - good or bad - are capable of some pretty disturbing things.  In Solondz' cinematic society, the sinners are just like you and me, whether that scares us or not.

It should also be noted that amidst all this weighty discussion, philosophy and sociological insight are some of the funniest and most demented sight gags, stuff that gives the Farrelly brothers a literal run for their runny money in the Gross Out Olympics (acronym: G.O.O) - body fluid jokes that put the ""stick"" back into ""slapstick"".  Gags that make you wanna.

And when the characters themselves instill the audience with laughter, Solondz' artistry and control leave us wondering whether we are laughting at them, with them, or in spite of them, when the truth is somewhere in between.  All of which makes this the most awfully funny movie I have ever seen.",1167436800,4,3194,4.934579439252336

It has some performances to die for, some of the most awkward and dry humor out there, is simultaneously hilariously funny and deeply disturbing, and has relatable characters that one can either recognize or realize chillingly exist right next door... or sometimes in your very own house.

It's a really great movie, especially utilizing Todd Solontz' particular brand of suburbia mentality. It's just that he didn't know where to stop. Mostly his relationships in this film are great, going in surprising directions and ultimately very telling about the type of person he's trying to create.

But honestly, did we even need any of the side-story about the parents? Every time we got back to them I got the distinct feeling that this was five, ten, fifteen minutes I'd be not watching other, better, more interesting characters develop. Also, the fat lady neighbor; ultimately, her story came out in the end and became worth it, but it was the most predictable and least tightly defined of all the characters.

I think Todd Solontz got a little into ""big cast"" syndrome (without actually having a hugely recognizable cast, save Hoffman and Boyle) to express as much widespread loneliness as possible, but didn't think about how much that may weigh down the otherwise biting and in-your-face social commentary.

It was a great movie, but it could have been even better.

1220378,4,B00000IC7G,"""Happiness"" is a movie that is basically about irony and everything about the movie is ironic...Including the title. No one in this movie is happy, not even the characters who think they are. And once the movie's over, you probably won't be overwhelmed with happiness either. This is not a happy movie...Although it is pretty funny, in a sick demented way. But I think the review on the cover sums up the film nicely;

""Deeply Disturbing and Shockingly Funny.""

This movie has some of the most disturbing and sometimes disgusting scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time. The movie centers around three sisters; Joy (Jane Adams), Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), and Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) Jordan. Although almost all the characters in the film kind of circle back to these three sisters, they're not really the main characters.

The movie opens with Joy on a dinner date with a man named Andy (Jon Lovitz). Andy looks distraught as Joy tells him that it's not going to work out. In what I think to be one of the funniest and awkward scenes in a movie that I've seen recently, Adam gives her a limited edition goldplated ashtray and then takes it away and tells her he's saving it for the girl who truly loves him. The credit sequence promptly follows. Then we suddenly meet a man named Allen (Oscar Winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) who explains to his therapist Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker, 'Head of State') that he's having sexual fantasties about his next door neighbor, who just happens to be Helen.

Bill also happens to be married to Trish. Ironic. Allen begins a series of calls to Helen, telling her in graphic detail what he thinks about her before more irony begins pouring in. Meanwhile, we learn that it seems Trish is the only happy one in this trio of sisters...She seems to have the perfect life; three kids and a good husband. But Bill is hiding something as well, a perverted fascination with little boys. Really disturbing scenes become of this fascination. There's also a subplot about the sister's parents (Louise Lasser & Ben Gazzarra) who are splitting up; And Camryn Manheim (The former ABC TV show 'The Apprentice') who plays a neighbor of Allen's who's also hiding a secret. Now, I expected to love ""Happiness"" for some reason; Even though I knew hardly anything of the plot. But, I didn't love...I liked it, but I didn't love it. It's a very unique movie and it's definitely funny; but I thought that the most interesting aspect of the movie was the one you see the least.

Allen, played so well by Hoffman, could've been the subject of his own film. Don't get me wrong, I don't think they should've gotten rid of the rest of the story but I think that they should have payed more attention to this character.

Besides the story, there are other good things about it. The dialogue is very smart and there's some classic lines in this movie. The conversations Bill has with his son are very creepy though. In case, this hasn't been made clear. This movie is not for everybody; Many people may find it sick and immoral, especially since it seems that nothing really bad happens to Bill despite his wrongdoings. But filmbuffs will appreciate it, but mature audiences are a must.

Directed by: Todd Solondz  Running Time: 140 Minutes

Critically accalimed in 1998 on many Top 10 lists, while watching this movie one can't help but wonder ""Why?""  What is it about this movie that makes it 'Top 10 Worthy'?  As the credits continue to roll, I still can't answer the question.

I can honestly say that I've never been more uncomfortable watching a movie.  Scene after scene you think to yourself, 'Okay, this can't get any more taboo, right?'  And then, all of a sudden, you see a father (who is a therapist, played by Dylan Baker) talking to his son about ""coming"" (the son is depressed because he hasn't ever had an orgasm, but allhis friends at school say that they have). One of the more uncomfortable scenes is when the father is talking to the son, ""Have you ever played with yourself"" ""Yes, well no, not really"".  ""Do you want me to show you?""  ""No (thank god). That's okay.""

The theme of the movie is about three sisters who have parents who are very unhappy with each other.  The mother is afraid of of becoming a divorcee, while the father is looking for feelings of any kind for anything.  The three daughters meanwhile each have there own problems.  The opening scene shows one of them at dinner with a man who kills himself the next day (Jon Lovitz, who got top billing, but in his only scene here, is really more of a cameo).

Next we move on to PSH's character who is rambling to a therapist (yep, same one as mentioned above) about a girl that he is in ""love"" with (yep, one of those daughters).  He's affraid to tell her his feelings, or for that matter, even talk to her.  Hoffman gets his kicks by making crank calls, hoping a woman answers on the other end, and hoping they don't hang up before he finishes pleasuring himself.  In one lucky scene, we get to watch PSH make one of these calls, and the scene closes with Hoffman wiping his semen off the wall.  The therapist, mind you, (you guessed it,  is also married to one of the ""three"") is trying to give the appearance of a normal life. But, in his spare time, we find him jerking off to Teen Beat magazines inthe back of his car (the male variety is the only that interest him), drugging his kids friends so he can fondle and rape them, dreaming about shooting strangers in a park and talking to his son about mastubation.  I wanted to hate this character so much. But there is so much confusion around him, and you know that he realizes that he has a disease.  He just is scared to face the music. These two men (Baker and Hoffman) are by far the most compelling characters.

The last unmentioned daughter is an aspiring author, who can't find a subject to write about.  She gets angry that she was never raped, because she thinks that would be a perfect topic to write about.  She's tired of everyone wanting to be with her and be like her.  But she imposes upon herself to keep the family running.

You would think that the above are all negatives about the movie.  But truthfully, it is an 'intersting' movie.  At times it feels like there is way too much going on, and you wish that the writer and director of the film would have focused more on portions of the story instead of opening so many cans of worms.  But should some of the scenes been taken out.  No.  But while watching you'll wish they would have.  Somehow it comes together to give the viewer a somewhat satisfied feeling.  Maybe it will take repeated viewings to understand what is really going on in this movie.  After just one viewing, it's impossible to know it all.  Between cringing at the uncomfortable scenes, black, dry and dark humor is abundant.  This carries the film and keeps the viewer wondering what else is next.

Did I mention the russian cab driver who loves New Jersey? How about the tenant who gets raped by the doorman and then kills him, cuts him up and throws him away little bits at a time in little baggies?

This DVD was unrated for obvious reasons.  Although there isn't any male, or child nudity, we do see a sex scene (with exposed female breast) and numerous scenes with implied male masturbation (one with a child) Everything in this film seems very foreign to watch as a movie.  We read (too many times) about these things happening in the newspaper, and think to ourselves 'That's too bad'.  But for someone to make a film about these things. Wow.  What do we take away from this?  Well, it could be said that everybody has problems.  Apperance on the outside isn't necessarily what is really going on. Most of these actors seem to be 'tolerating' there lives, rather than trying to make them better.

But really, what makes this movie good (if anything)?  Again, I think it's too soon to say for me if this is a good movie.  I think the story line that is anything but routine for Hollywood is fun to watch.  It's fresh and different. To see these actors play out on the screen some of the most uncomfortable topics is great to watch.

Do I recommend this film?  Certainly.  But only to the most open minded people.  Not for the conservative.  I don't regret watching this movie, and I will most certainly watch it again.  I think a film like this deserves at least two or more viewings so it can be appreciated what these actors did, and in hopes that we can make sense of these unfortunate lives.",1142380800,,5402,4.45158002038736
1220421,5,B00000IC7G,"I watched this film hoping to be blown away, and afraid I'd be too disgusted to finish it. I'd heard so many things about it, both good and bad, that I had no idea what to expect.  And indeed, it was the absolute last thing I expected: truly and profoundly boring.

Having recently watched 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' (which I adored) and now 'Happiness', I think Solondz employs a reliable method to evoke laughter - he delves into our deepest anxieties, in this case our fear that we are depraved, weak, pitiful, unlovable. While many movies dance around this subject matter, Solondz dives right in, and refuses to grant any relief. His films tell you that your worst doubts may very well be true. That break-up conversation WILL go horribly wrong. The sad loser you dump WON'T recover and go on to find his soul mate. I consider myself to be fairly demon-riddled, and thus a prime candidate to enjoy this type of humor, but 'Happiness', despite the abundance of sexual fluids, remains an oddly arid film.

While I know this will comparison will cause 'Happiness' lovers to quiver with rage, I really consider 'American Beauty', while far less ambitious, to be a more powerful film. I sympathized with Kevin Spacey's character a great deal, which made his obsession with his daughter's best friend all the more squicky. I didn't empathize with anyone in 'Happiness' in the slightest, and was therefore not moved by the cruelty, pathos, and flat-out stupidity of their actions. Everyone could have turned into giant, talking aardvarks halfway through the movie, and I wouldn't have been particularly surprised or affected.

I find this particularly odd because I know several women like Joy, and feel the anxiety her character is meant to evoke: what do you do with people who care so much about helping others, but are somehow ineffectual? I would think I'd find her character utterly engrossing, but no. Not even a shiver of interest. While watching `Dollhouse', I was constantly debating whether to laugh, cry, or throw up. While watching ""Happiness', I was debating whether to turn it off and catch something on HBO.

Finally, and I know this is just a personal quirk, I can't stand watching conversations that are filled with long, awkward pauses, which pretty much defines this entire movie.

The acting is fairly solid and there are a few funny moments here and there, which is why I think the film merits two stars. Overall, though, if you haven't seen a Solondz yet, I'd suggest `Dollhouse'. I'd also like to recommend another movie that covers similar themes, though it is not well known: `Spanking the Monkey'.",1138492800,4,2621,4.865470852017937
1220422,2,B00000IC7G,"Sometimes when I read a review from someone else I usually go by them, be it Roger Ebert or any of the Hollywood Critics. A lot praised Happiness, but I find it to be boring, overlong and sometimes funny but who really cares. There's four stories here and in the end they connect with family members. The stories go like this....there's some guy, he looks depressed, he's fat and he likes to call women up on the phone, while he masterbates, yeah, may the force be with him...anyway and talk dirty to them adn then hang up and there's this girl who lives next door to him who wants to know who this guy is that keeps calling her and hanging up on her. Meanwhile, one of women who lives in the apartment tells the guy she killed the doorman, cut him up into pieces and she still has some of his remains in the fridge. 2nd story consists of a Father who has a loving wife and kids....his oldest son is having trouble trying to make the white gooey stuff come out and his Father says, ""when the right time comes, you'll come"" and his Father happens to be a pedophile and winds up being arrested for molesting his Son's friend and a kid at his Son's school....ok, with me so far? Ok the 3rd story consists of an old couple and the 4th one consits of a school teacher who falls madly in love with one of her russian students who happens to be a thief and he seduces her, they do it and he steals her guitar and anyway, that's what the movie has for you.  If your cup of tea is watching some guy try to get a boy to eat a sandwich and then molest him or closeup shots of semen hitting stuff and then a dog licking it up, then have at it but it isn't mine. Jane Adams (Anniversary Party) is my only interest and that's what made me watch it...from the first scene where she dumps Jon Lovitz (Little Nicky) and the rest of her story...she's the actress that kept me from turning the movie off and what kept it at a 2 star rating. Also starring Jared Harris (Igby Goes Down), Dylan Baker (Changing Lanes), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote), Lara Flynn Boyle (Where the Day Takes You), Camryn Manheim (Tv's The Practice), Ben Gazzara (Road House) and Molly Shannon (Superstar).

1220423,5,B00000IC7G,"Todd Solondz shares no rival. His ability to craft a tale of such sorrow while incorporating brutally fantastic hero is the true beauty of ""Happiness.""

1220424,3,B00000IC7G,"Just don't watch it all at once, cos it does get a bit repetitive at times. In all, I watched it 3 parts, simply because I didn't have the time to watch it. I switched it off an hour into it originally, as I was in too much of a mood to 'enjoy' it if that's the right word. It is one of the most powerful films you'll see, but also one of the most shocking & depressing.

You know you're in for a ride, when the film starts abruptly with a really harsh breakup (which I didn't need to see), and ends with a family moving out.

The actors really throw themselves into their roles, especially the father (Dylan Baker) & son (Rufus Read). These scenes were the most uncomfortable I've ever had to watch in a film, as it deals heavily in paedophilia. I had to say, the dad & son discussing [...], and then their final scene, were handled brilliantly. It's an embarrassing subject at the best of times, but with the paedophilia hanging over the scenes, it will make you squirm. This subject might put people off the film, and I'll say, I thought it would be, but it's handled well, and most scenes are based on implication, rather than actually showing anything.

Other issues the actors deal with are: divorce late on in life; a single 30-something female, who's largely ignored, and is part of the break up at the beginning of the film; sex with a student (was he really a student?); obscene phonecalls; and murder. Not a cheery film, and one you definitely have to psyche yourself up for, and be in the right mood. Be in the wrong mood and the movie will fail.

This movie will stir up some really strange emotions in you, that when the credits roll, you won't be sure whether you'll love or hate it. I'm still torn. It's definitely not a film that will be going back in my DVD player anytime soon, but it will also stay with me for a good long while yet. I unfortunately saw a lot of myself in Jane Adams character, which has given me the heebies jeebies. That's the thing about the two films of Todd Solondz's films that I've seen - both times I've seen myself in one of the characters. (Welcome To The Dollhouse is the other.)

I'm curious about seeing Palindromes now, Todd Solondz's latest movie, just to see how that turns out. Nothing will ever match Happiness or Welcome To The Dollhouse, as both films have effected me in a way that no other film ever will. And you'll never let a dog lick you in the face after seeing this film again. You'll be left with shivers going up your spine afterwards, and wandering what did happen at the end. Oh by the way, it ends abruptly. Just be prepared.",1127260800,4,2595,4.3312757201646095
1220425,5,B00000IC7G,"This movie isn't for everyone, but it you like independent film and can handle a look inside the dark side, give it a try. It has everything to capture the audience with pure freakiness--masturbating crank callers, a teen trying to learn how to masturbate and asking for advice, a pedophilic father, a woman who cut someone up and put him in the freezer, and that's just scratching the surface. I'll admit that at times I didn't know where the movie was going, but I was always interested in learning more about the characters' sick, twisted, and intertwined lives. Give this a try if you are adventurous and can handle a dark, dark, dark comedy.",1125878400,4,646,4.675438596491228
1220426,2,B00000IC7G,"Todd Solondz is an undeniably talented filmmaker, with an ear for dialogue that rivals with the best. I haven't seen his most recent film PALINDROMES yet, but his 2001 film STORYTELLING, for me, proved that he could be genuinely challenging and provocative, making a two-part film that explored ideas about truth and art, and whether art can ever really contain truth. In many ways, it was Solondz striking back at his critics. STORYTELLING was a film with thematic depth that still managed to maintain that shocking edge that characterized this film and his 1995 WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE; that's why, of his first three films, I consider STORYTELLING to be the best of them.

As for HAPPINESS...well, for all its occasional scenes of sensitive acting and writing, and for all its occasionally effective shock scenes (enough to earn the movie an extra star from me), HAPPINESS strikes me as little more than a generally worthless freakshow of a movie. It's as if Solondz decided to put his mind toward creating as shocking and disgusting a bunch of characters as possible, placing them in everyday settings, filming the various stories in as innocent-looking a style as possible (the set designs and bright color schemes seem right out of a '60s family TV show or something), and calling the whole thing his singularly harsh vision of the darkness underlying suburbia. But I never bought for a second that this was the work of someone who was serious about exploring characters or motivations, or exploring what could lead to such shocking behavior in the suburbs. No, in HAPPINESS, Todd Solondz is simply trying to shock you as much as  possible---and apparently it worked well enough that people fell for it and considered it ""edgy"" and ""brilliant."" It may be edgy and brilliant after all; but it's also worthless as either black comedy or a harsh look at the depravity that lurks underneath the placid veneer of suburban existence. Call me a prude if you must, but I still found Solondz's misanthropy much more convincing in the superior WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE. Skip this one.",1124755200,7,2081,4.925925925925926
1220427,4,B00000IC7G,"I'm not really sure what the writer/director wants us to take away. I rarely feel that way after a film. This, however, is a hard, hard, hard film to watch. Here it is in a nutshell: Interlocking stories of people who are deeply miserable or harboring secrets, who all want to connect and BE happy, but just can't seem to fit in. And maybe that's the point--that none of us fully fit our ideal of happiness, that happiness is just a moment here or there and that it passes and our dark human condition won't be covered up for long. I'm not so cynical as to think joy and happiness are impossible. (I'm pretty darn happy a good deal of the time despite the occasional blows of life) This film, however, makes you wonder if your own life is undermined by what's going on in the life of people around you. In this film, the clean-cut ""family guy"" is a pedophile who, bit by bit, loses control and takes his desires beyond fantasy/masturbation to reality/rape. The character who thinks she has a perfect life is living a lie and doesn't know it until her world crashes down on her. The older couple are splitting up, and the man has become numb, so lacking in true feeling that sex is meaningless and the act of salting his food becomes a supremely nihilistic statement. The hopeful, wounded waif keeps being rejected at every turn, becoming the scapegoat for the misery of those around her. Rejection in all forms abounds. Pain in hideous variety. Horrors in assorted flavors. And you can't look away thought something in you says, ""I shouldn't see this. Do I have to see this? I want to see something PRETTY RIGHT NOW, PLEASE!""

Camryn Mannheim is oddly touching as a woman whose misery and isolation make her flip out at the moment of an unwanted and uninvited human connection. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays yet another misfit who can't make his life work. Jane Addams looks like a breeze could knock her over, she's so fragile. The pedophile makes you want to run criminal searches on all the adult males in your neighborhood who seem so ""nice, quiet, hard-working.""It's unrelenting.

Watch this movie if you can empathize with an array of futile searches for happiness. Be prepared to be slapped in the face by the underbelly of several lives. I gave it four stars because it was masterfully done, not because I ""really liked it""--because this is not a film you can like. Why then? Because it was impossible for me to look away or to turn it off and not know how it ended. Because I kept hoping for some ray of light to shine on these damaged people. If you think you're brave enough, see this.  Happiness is rivetting, but oh-so horrible.

I truly understand each character because of my experience with similiar ""dysfunctional"" people I've tried to relate to in my life.  Believe me - the Todd Solondz's exceptional writing and directing and the method-like ""nonacting"" hit it right on.  If you can relate, like myself, the truth of it will scare the hell out of you.

1220461,3,B00000IC7G,"Eventually I had to see this controversial, cultish film, which I had been told by various parties was distasteful, full of hilarity, socially relevant.  Indeed, it's all three--a dark comedy that occupies a midway place between ""Deliverance"" and ""Something About Mary.""  Unfortunately, the shocking scenes don't have sufficient justification to illuminate life and the comedy doesn't entertain sufficiently to justify the frequently deviant subject matter.  (I laughed heartily at the opening scene with Jon Lovitz, but thereafter the film provokes primarily the kind of nervous laughter that serves as a defense against embarrassment).

The narrative is engaging but in a way that lacks, on the one hand, the verisimilitude of a Robert Altman movie and, on the other, the depth of Woody Allen (in his Ingmar Bergman mode).  And if the intent is to do a parody of soap opera, ""Guiding Light"" is way beyond ""Happiness"" both in its intricate, multiple plotting and its resonant, complex characterizations.  By comparison, ""Happiness"" is shallow, juvenile, and cynical--a film that, whatever its intentions, is without much insight or heart.  I found myself responding to some of its questionable choices (masturbation and pedophiliac scenes)  as I did to Kenneth Starr's obsession with throwing in our faces each and every lurid detail of Clinton's affair with Monica.  Who needs it?

Stolondz obviously (far ""too"" obviously) wants to make a case for empathy and compassion for society's outcasts.  He fails to make that case.  Fritz Lang's brilliant ""M"" (1930) is far more successful both in exposing the common dominator of ""original sin"" and in eliciting compassion for a serial child killer who, like Dr. Maplewood, ""can't help himself.""  By contrast ""Happiness,"" in its climactic father-son talk, offers little more than masturbation as a metaphor for the redirection of antisocial impulses.

What ""saves"" the film, if anything, is the acting.  Each of the three sisters is sharply individualized, thanks less to the script than absolutely ""on key"" performances that somehow transcend the caricaturist  dialogue.  There's Lara Flynn (as a worldly prima-donna writer), Cynthia Stevenson (as a ""necessarily"" happy married yuppie who ""has it all"") and, above all, Jane Adams (as the youngest, relentlessly victimized sister).  Also, Dylan Baker, as the psychiatrist-pedophile, strikes just the right balance between a serenely successful professional and a neurotic and clumsy, middle-aged  ritard.  Finally, it's always rewarding to see Ben Gazarra back on the screen.  His appearance alone generally insures that something of value can be salvaged from an otherwise questionable if not time-wasting scenario.

(Postscript: I'll have to admit that a ""dramatic"" film that manages to hit home with many young people and that provokes good writing such as that in the ""Spotlight Review,"" may have more going for it than I'm able or willing to see.  I certainly don't mean to dismiss the film because of the subject matter, however repellant.  Unflinching artists--from Sophocles to Nabakov to Hubert Selby--amply testify to the importance of taking on conventional ""taboos,"" both to get our attention and to get us to see beyond the morally myopic.  ""Happiness"" may be an off-center movie that aspires to be art.  If so, it's not so much a mediocre film as a pretentious one.)",1118534400,9,3375,5.35673624288425

So, I decided to rent this, based on that review alone, and I have to say that I was suprised. Solondz really gets the most out of his actors. He really divulges into the worlds of those semingly normal people, and shows what they really are on the inside, in a brillant fashion. I was floored by the shocking last line and reaction of this film. It left me stunned that such a film took such a gruesome subject, and made it into its own little world.

I'm fully aware of the corniness of what I've just said, but this film is also one of the most effective comedies that I've ever seen, somehow making us burst out in laughter when a man slaughters a lawn full of happy people with an M-16 in a dream, or explaining to his son that he has indeed molested a number of his friends.

Conversation between characters is scripted without a single reservation, the writers completely without fear of touching verbally and squarely upon pedaphilia, homophobia, and the like, with language unapologically blunt, causing the kind of reaction that the word ""vagina"" uttered loud and clear would cause among a group of strangers.

What am I supposed to think about something I have empathy for and laugh at? That's the open-ended question that remains long after the plot is tied up. You always hear people say that they don't know whether to laugh or cry in everyday situations, but how many director's do you think can capture such a real feeling in a fictional story? todd solondz is amazing and overlooked, and this is his gem. He sees things as the are, with an appreciation for irony and the ability to observe without judging. ""Happiness"" is a low-budget movie; I can't deny that it shows. It doesn't look like a shiny new hollywod blockbuster. It looks like an actors-without-pay indie film. That's what it is, but the cast always pulls through. For the most part, they're good actors with a good script who show up and play their part. There are visible flaws, but the final product is emotional, disturbing, and surprisingly funny. This is not Dr. Strangelove; this is not The Graduate. This is the epitome of dark humor in it's most extreme form. Dig it.",1107648000,6,1574,4.526315789473684

My only favorite scene was the first scene of the film with Jon Lovitz ""No you're not!"". Jon Lovitz, great guy. Too bad he only had one scene. I thought I had made the right choice renting this movie, but after that scene, it went all downhill from there. I do understand why it's titled ""Happiness"", but it's just too overwhelming for me. Child molestation is a very serious topic, and I don't find it something to be joked about.

1220520,4,B00000IC7G,"There have been few times that I've sat for more than two hours, intently watching a film, screaming ""I hate this movie!"" as the credits begin to roll, but then realize that I don't hate it at all. In fact, I don't know if that has ever happened before, but last night, after the final, revolting line of Todd Solondz's 1998 shocker Happiness, I did just that, and probably because I couldn't bring myself to admit I liked it. It's a movie that deals with wildly perverse subject matter, contains not a truly likeable character in the whole bunch, and doesn't even bother to show the consequences of the horrible actions for any of its transgressors. If there is a poster-child movie for complete and total amorality, Happiness is the one. But I liked it, and that scares me.

  Joy (Jane Adams) has absolutely nothing in common with her name; her sister Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is a sultry, narcissistic author who wants the experience of being raped to make her writing authentic; other sister Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) is married to Dr. Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) and has three kids. Dr. Bill is a pedophile who pleasures himself to teen magazines in the backseat of his car and has dreams of murdering strangers in a park; Dr. Bill's strangest patient, Allen (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), makes obscene phone calls and has an inventive way of pasting postcards to the wall; Allen's neighbor, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), is in love with him but has her own disgusting little story to hide. Nearly every character has a dark side, the only truly 'good' one (Joy) seems to get everything wrong, and the one romance that blooms during the movie has a twinge of wrongness to it. The movie is a strung-together mosaic of perpetual sadness, the search for the remedy, and the stomach-churning causes of it all; and yet, between my gasps of shock and uneasiness, I can't say there's a boring moment in the film.

  The most difficult character in the movie to even look at is, obviously, Dr. Maplewood. Dylan Baker has that glaring gaze that could boil cheese, and it takes on an especially creepy tone when he's gazing longingly at his son's baseball teammate at a little league game. But, believe it or not, Solondz injects comedy even into something as despicable as the Maplewood situation. The film's most controversial scene, involving drugged chocolate sundaes and a tuna salad sandwich, is god-awfully wrong...but had me thinking about that great moment in Psycho when Marion Crane's car stops as it's sinking into the swamp and Norman Bates panics for a moment. And laughing, too. This element of the plot angered many people in 1998 and is still something to wrestle to this day; why make Maplewood a three-dimensional man with real emotions when all he is is a predatory pederast? Because it wouldn't be interesting, it wouldn't be watchable, if he wasn't. Take a climactic scene in the film, that must deal with the truths of Maplewood's actions: Solondz creates a scene that is brutally honest and deeply disturbing, but still grounded in the poignancy of a father-son discussion.

  I found myself alternating between pure puzzlement and a desire to turn the movie off in its first, love-it-or-leave-it act. But Solondz is in such control of his connecting plot strands that he makes the links quickly, moves in and out of them with ease, and even allows for unexpectedly moving moments to occur. The great subplot of the film is with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Camryn Manheim. In some ways, it sums up the entire theme of the film, while having all of Happiness' strengths and weaknesses. Solondz gives us a great scene where the two come together, dancing to a pop song in a bar, and it's a brief moment of euphoria and sweetness despite the depravity that surrounds and underscores it. Of course, for some viewers, the hidden lives of even Allen and Kristina may be too strange to merit caring about. I struggled with it, too.

  Solondz made a very good film a few years ago, Storytelling (rent it), that contains similarly risque subject matter but ends up being too facile in the resolutions of the two vignettes that comprise the film. His breakthrough movie, Welcome to the Dollhouse, came before Happiness, and takes a similarly piercing look at real life but is bogged down too much in its deadpan humor and relentless punishment of its protagonist. Happiness straddles the shortcomings of both of those films, neither offering a simple resolution to its problems or being too strange to the point where unrealism sets in. It is real, it is complex, and it's also deeply disturbing and maybe morally offensive. I'm also known for not really caring about the morality of a movie, so maybe that's why I was never bored or too offended at any time.

  The best line in Happiness comes toward the very end, when the sisters and their parents are sitting around talking about a grisly New Jersey murder, involving dismemberment and plastic baggies, that occurred in the apartment building of Flynn Boyle's Helen. ""Everyone uses baggies; that's why we can relate to this crime,"" she says. Happiness is one of those twisted American suburbia flicks that contains things that happen every day, probably closer to us than we expect. That's why I could relate to this movie. I don't expect you to; in fact, I don't blame you if you hate it with a passion or don't get past the first ten minutes. Things will happen that will disgust you, revolt you, and disturb you. There is no reason why anyone should like this movie or why it should 'work.' But I was entertained in some sick and twisted way, even while my jaw stayed glued to the floor.

1220535,5,B00000IC7G,"I loved ""Happiness"". Not once did it breach my sense of ethics, humor or morality. That might be because it is a film expressly intended to dig into the tenuous roots of modern morality, humor, and ethics.

 It goes without saying that I had an idea of what I was going to see coming in. If you rent/buy this film under the impression that you are going to sit back and be entertained for a few hours, you will be in for quite the unpleasant shock. But after all, isn't that why there's a label on the front: ""FOR MATURE AUDIENCES""? Yeah, probably. All you Fascists of Film who got your panties in a bunch because it deals with subject matter you can't handle should stick to ""Love Actually"" or ""13 Going on 30"".

 The truth of the matter is that Solondz's ""Happiness"" is one of the most engaging, challenging films to roll around in awhile. It is also drop dead funny, if in an extremely strange way. It forces us to sympathize with characters we normally see on the 6:00 news wearing orange jumpsuits, leg shackles and cuffs, and does so in a way we will never forget. Admittedly, Solondz's portrait of humanity is not appealing or optimistic; the characters run the gamut from revolting specimens, deeply sick individuals, depressed and 'downcast' people, criminals, to children caught in the crossfire of a postmodern world devoid of real human connection. My favorite scene is when Timmy's father, a closet pedophile, makes a desperate plea to his oblivious wife. ""I'm sick,"" he says, his face dead pale. ""Take an aspirin,"" she replies drowsily.

 The lie of cozy domesticity, the illusion of innocence, the truly repugnant nature of most of our basic instincts are driven home with brutal force. The ending is the most heart-rending piece in the entire film, and one wonders how they pulled it off. Think of it as a particularly distasteful episode of ""South Park"" with cinematic genius behind it. Kudos to Todd Solondz for having the balls to make and market this singular, disturbing film.",1091750400,,1997,4.724137931034483
1220536,4,B00000IC7G,"This is quite a movie.  Some think it's brilliant, others say it's hideous, perverted garbage.  I was rather impressed.  The screenplay was daring, unusual, and intelligent, and the acting was all-round superb.

 Of course this is not the kind of movie that everyone can enjoy - it's two and a half hours of utter human misery and depravity, all centered around the powerful sexual obsession that can overwhelm and eventually consume people.  I felt deep sadness for the son of the child molestor, who spends the movie worrying about whether he will ever have an orgasm - at only eleven, he has already been corrupted by a society that is hopelessly bound to and dependent on sexuality.  The sexual web extends to everyone in the film; it leads to shame, guilt, anxiety, depression, manipulation, self-debasement, emptiness, betrayal, and murder.  It is all done with complete frankness, so the squeamish should beware.

Is this a devastating comment about the human condition, or is this Todd Solenz getting revenge on the rest of the world because he can't get any?  It's very likely that both are true.  This is a film both cynical and deeply human.  There's a certain moment at the end involving a dog that goes too far and cost the movie a star.

1220537,2,B00000IC7G,"This review refers to the Lions Gate Signature Series DVD edition of ""Happiness""...

Did you ever watch Fear Factor?....You don't REALLY want to see people eating maggots, drinking bile and then puking all over the place...you don't REALLY want to see someone buried in a coffin with 10,000 hissing cockroaches, but yet, there is something about it that, once you're there, you have to see if they can do it. But once is usually enough...and that is how it is with this film.

There wasn't anything shocking about this film, it was all stuff that's on the news daily, the stuff I want to get away from for a couple of hours when I view a film. The story, which revolves around 3 sisters, each with their own inner longings and secrets, is filled with the most depressing, vile, dysfunctional, and taxing array of characters. And...that goes double for the subject matter, which includes a big dose of child molestation among other disturbing scenes.

The two stars I give for this film is for the extraoridnary cast; they portrayed these characters intensly and realistically. It was their performances that kept me until the end. The cast includes Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jane Adams, Jared Harris, Elizabeth Ashley, Dylan Baker,Jon Lovitz Lara Flynn Boyle, Cynthia Stevenson,Louise Lasser and a welcome appearance by Ben Gazzara.

The DVD is presented in Widescreen, DD2.0 Surround, has subtitles in Spanish, English and French, and has some very informative cast and crew bios.

1220538,1,B00000IC7G,"""If you can't handle the realism, it's your problem; this movie isn't afraid to be honest; blah blah blah."" On the contrary, Solondz goes to ludicrous extremes of contrivance to convince us that the world is horrible, people are monsters, and there's not a damn thing anyone can do about it. Every single character in this film is depressed, insane, a pervert, or a liar, and every character is unhappy. That's neither realistic nor, in my opinion, ""honest"" on any deeper level. Solondz does his utmost to deny the existence of any chance for redemption. The worldview this movie conveys seems to be that of a deeply troubled person desperately trying to tell us that everyone else is as miserable as he is. I'm not saying some of the things he depicts don't happen in the real world (albeit in less contrived ways). But to focus on them, to the exclusion of anything else, to make a point about the impossibility of obtaining happiness, seems dishonest, manipulative, and downright irresponsible.
I really wanted to like this movie. It was well made and well acted.

It is only funny because a smile is all you can do to deal with what you are witnessing. It is nauseating. It is completely taboo. You do not want to tell people you saw this. You do not want to watch it with your girlfriend. You do not want to recommend it. You would feel excruciatingly embarrassed to watch this with your parents. You can not comprehend why anyone would want to make it. You feel that the actors have gone too far. You never want to see anything like it again. However, inside, deep down, you know that what you have seen is nothing short of the horrific truth about some people. You know that your parents could very well be like this. You know that your girlfriend or boyfriend may have some secrets like this. You know that your friends could well be involved in some of the topics conveyed in this film. You know all too well that the media reports on it 24/7. You know that PEOPLE DO THESE THINGS! But it is taboo, taboo and it is not you! Never you! How could you ever do such a thing or even think such things.... But there in the darkness of your soul is something that is not a hundred miles away from the topics that this darkest of film expounds on. The human condition and its western syndrome are all too capable of what is on display here.
The fact remains that millions of people have experienced first-hand much of themes that this film covers. It is not something that does not happen. It does and they do. The media talk about non-stop. Any tabloid magazine is full of it. The telephone services have to deal with it - so do the police and social services. People even make money out of these things. It is terrible, awful, disgusting - but real.
What most people fail to realize is that this film is all about the mentally ill who have very deep-seeded psychological problems that they can not cope with, without some help. These people can be found in any walk of life. As on display in ""Happiness"" those who suffer from these diseases of the mind are in fact everyday Joe-soaps and some with important jobs or are even authority figures. It is this angle that makes it all the more real and upsetting. It is this upper-class take on the whole problem that shows that no matter who you are, you too can suffer from these problems. Too long has this material been only played out in the hands of the seedy ""villains"" or underground freaks. Too long has cinema devoted these themes to prisoners and baddies and the elements of society who most of us never engage in. Here we see our friends, family, employers, employees, doctors and teachers all doing what they should not be doing! This is why this film deserves the acclaim that it got. It did the right thing. It did it the right way. It did it to balance out this topic that has always been dealt with unjustly.

The perversity in the movie is just more of the same emotional/intellectual disconnect joining everyone at the hip/groin/head/hand/foot. They are all skewed.

The Amazon.com review calls this film ""abuse in the guise of art,"" an ill-conceived criticism which shows why this film is so revelatory.  The best films do not play to the moral rigidities or sensitivities of the viewer, but attempt to shatter these and reveal situations in new lights.  Yes, there is a pedophile in the film.  No, he is not glorified.  Perhaps he is humanized.. but he is a HUMAN BEING.  People can fall in love with others besides those of the opposite sex who have reached a certain age.  (See Mann's Death in Venice, Lolita, etc.)  If you want your TV movie-of-the-week with its sugarcoated, spoonfed morality, look elsewhere.
The comparison of the father's disturbed sexuality with his son's sexual coming of age is interesting as well.  The son is preoccupied with his ejaculatory ""rite of passage"" into manhood.  We're all sexual beings and we've all passed that rite.. but what happens when our intrinsic sexual natures go awry, as with the father?
The other stories are outstanding, especially Vlad, the simultaneously hilarious and disturbing ""go-getter"" new to America.  The only flaw was the story of the elderly couple, whose apathetic stupor contributes little to the film.
It has been said that great literature suggests a vastness without explicitly saying it.  This movie suggests a lot, and leaves one thinking.

1220571,3,B00000IC7G,"While watching this generally well-made film, I could not help but keep wondering why it was even made.  Happiness evokes anything but that emotion.
Happiness is what I think of as an unfunny comedy.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, it just means that it has few - if any - ha ha ha moments.  Instead, it is just the generally the absurdity of the world depicted that makes it amusing.  In a certain way, the world of this movie is funny, but it is generally just bleak and disturbing.  Not a single scene lacks unpleasantness and often the viewer is even more uncomfortable than the characters.
Nonethless, like a car crash, you cannot look away from this tale of three sisters each undergoing problems in their lives.  One sister, played by Jane Adams, is the most likable, but is also is such a willing victim to life that she is often unsympathetic.  Another sister is so intent on having an ideal life she is self-righteously smug, even as her child-molesting husband is about to bring ruin to her world.  The final sister is perhaps the only happy character in the entire film, primarily because she is so shallow and self-centered.  Add to this mix the story of their parents splitting up and a pathetic obscene phone caller and you have a disjointed and disturbing film.
Even if a viewer disagrees with my assessment about the unpleasantness of this movie, few can dispute that there is just too much going on.  There are at least four stories going on, all virtually separate from each other, and just when you get interested in one plot line, it disappears for twenty minutes and you practically forget about it.  Everything ties together to a limited extent at the end of the movie, but it's too little, too late.  Nonetheless, this is still a (weak) three star movie, based on the generally good acting and writing, despite the unhappy nature of the story.  It is the feel-bad movie of the 90's.",1059436800,,1912,4.621301775147929

  Without going into the lurid details of what makes this movie so controversial (read any other review to get the idea), Solondz' main strength would appear to be his allowing his excellent ensemble cast the latitude to fully investigate their roles. Even Jon Lovitz, not exactly what one would usually think of when the word ""method acting"" comes up, delivers a delightfully unrestrained, semi-monologue at the beginning of the film that serves as the keynote address in the convention of the mad that is to follow. Perfect delivery. Perfect timing. Nice payoff.
  Self-indulgent or not, the film will definitely hold your interest (even when you wish it wouldn't) and have you believing in the characters and the storyline. Don't watch with Grandma and the kids, unless you have an even more bizarre and dysfunctional family than the one depicted here.

At one point in my life, I had a great deal of patience with experimental work, precisely because it was experimental.  The very effort to establish new ground, to expand the vocabulary of the cinema (or of music or literature, whatever the genre) seemed admirable, in some cases even heroic.  But the older you get, the less patience you have with youthful indulgences and pretensions.  It just happens.
It's nice to be reminded that there are people out there, doing provocative, challenging work, that is also good.  As I read some of the comments people have posted here re: Todd Solondz' 1998 film HAPPINESS, I found myself agreeing both with the positive AND many of the negative reviews.  It is a difficult, actually oftentimes painful film to watch.  The humor, mordant as it may be, is apparently all that saves Solondz from total despair.  (I could be wrong on this point, since I know little about him and haven't yet seen his other work.)  What I can say is that this stark, grim movie is one that sticks with you.  You may end up wishing otherwise, but you won't forget it.
One point where I would differ with a number of the film's harsher critics.  I don't know that the Dylan Baker's character is particularly sypmpathetic.  He is portrayed as being complex and tormented soul--traits that would seem to be likely in at least some pederasts.  One could say that Fritz Lang's classic film M's portrait of a child abuser (in this case, actually, a child murderer) more sympathetic than Solondz.  Are ANY of the characters treated all that sympathetically, really?  Perhaps if you have the compassion of the Buddha...",1054080000,2,1759,4.721311475409836
1220575,4,B00000IC7G,"Having seen 'Storytelling', I had a fairly good idea of what I was getting myself into when I picked this movie up.  It deals with adult subject matter, for sure, but it manages to present the inherent, subtle humor of strange, bizzare, or grotesque  situations.  One scene that sticks out in my mind is when Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is in a diner with the character played by Camryn Manheim and she just finished telling him about her being assaulted and the particularly gruesome way she dealt with the assault, and he replied, ""Well, we all have our plusses and minuses.""  I laughed until my sides hurt.  You really have to see the scene and all it's nuances to fully appreciate it.  And there are a lot of scenes like this throughout the movie.  This is definately a squeamish and unsettling type of movie with some pretty difficult subject matter.  Given that, I wouldn't recommend this movie to just anyone.  Seek it out if you must, but be warned, it's not a happy story.  As far as one reviewers' statement that the scenes were presented for there shock value only, I didn't really see it that way.  I saw a peeling away of the appearance that is presented by people to show the sorid underbelly of life, like turning over a big rock to see what kind of creepy crawlies are hiding underneath.  That's not to say that the people in this movie are representative of people in general, but I think we all have little secrets about ourselves, our 'rocks', that we wouldn't want the rest of the world to know.  I can understand why some people would be turned off by a movie like this, as I think a lot of people go to see movies to escape from this kind of material.  Also, I think Dylan Baker did an excellent job in portraying his character.  He played a character who seemed to have the idyllic life, a beautiful wife, a large home in the suburbs, three children, and good career...and pedoephillic tendancies towards young boys.  He was so creepy, taking advantage of oppourtunities presented to him, regardless of the consequences.  I didn't feel sorry for his character, but I did feel like he was a creature trapped by his own demons, acting on his primal urges.  He was what he was, and that wasn't going to change.  I don't understand the urges he felt, but the characterization of the monster he became was certainly interesting to watch.  I enjoyed this movie, and I am looking forward to seeing 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'.

1220576,1,B00000IC7G,"Normally, I am a fan of this style of film.  The type that mixes in doses of black comedy while dealing largely with dysfunctional lives.  After all, it is about time that we begin peel away those layers of phoniness, that pretense that everything is alright, and deal with the fact that our culture breeds dysfunctionality and neurosis.
However, Happiness is a very lame attempt to do that.  While the film tries to show us plenty of disturbed characters attempting to shroud themselves with some semblance of normalcy, none of these characters are developed beyond pathetic cardboard cutouts and tired stereotypes.  They elicit no response whatsoever from the viewer, who is left wondering, ""who cares?"".
Happiness also attempts to portray the neurotic actions of its ""characters"" as both shocking and darkly humorous.  They are neither.  It is painfully and embarrassingly obvious that these actions are presented for shock value alone, and not for any intellectual or aesthetic benefit.  And as far as dark comedy goes, if you find rapist pedaphiles who are presented as sympathetic figures funny, then knock yourself out.  Although many viewers may be offended by such images and issues, I myself am not.  What I am offended by though is a film that blatantly tries to manipulate its viewer into some kind of response and hides behind the guise of art, as Happiness does.
This film tries too hard to be shocking and different, but ends up only being transparent and tiring.",1053302400,7,1478,5.0

It takes the story of a family and people and just puts it all out there. At times funny,strange and wierd but reason i give this 5 stars is because it's a very unique and diffrent film. Ive never seen a film like this before so it deserves 5 for its creativity and openness on the subject matter and the actors were amazing, perfect actors for the charachters in this movie. I didn't find this movie disturbing like the people in some of the reviews on here said- there was no nudity and not much violence ( that you can see).But i guess this got a nc 17 rating for the subject matter of pedophilia and all the other issues they discuss. There was one part i thought was a lil sick at the end but other than that the movie is fine if you are ok with witnessing people talking about some major issues in thier lives. This is the first Todd Solondz movie ive seen and i think i just might try the other movies he has since i liked this one. This movie deals with diffrent people with so many diffrent problems and it is very strange but brilliant at same time. But ive seen movies that were way more disturbing than this one so like i said it's not bad only subject matter. Anyone under 18 i guess shouldnt see this- though it really depends on how mature you are if you are open minded on discussing and watching controversial subjects and getting into peoples heads. Id say i wouldve still enjoyed this and not been offended even at 17. I'm 21 now. But all kids arnt the same so yes not for under 18 but all over 18 this is a good movie, i recomend it.",1052870400,2,1798,4.229651162790698
1220602,4,B00000IC7G,"Man, this is difficult, difficult movie!!  It's packed full of thoroughly unlikeable characters.  And they do some awfully uncomfortable things.
The actors are all outstanding.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a loser (what a stretch!!) who starts making obscene phone calls to his next door neighbor (Lara Flynn Boyle), who enjoys them.  What happens when they meet?  That's just one sample of the kind of interactions you might see in this movie.  It plays a little like MAGNOLIA, but without much of the hopeful tone that movie ends with.
But the source of all the controversy in this movie is the character played by the brave, brilliant Dylan Baker. He plays a totally milquetoast, average, middle-class father.  Yet his character is also a child-molester.  I wouldn't say his character is presented sympathetically, but he isn't always shown as just a monster either.  There's one scene, wherein his son has just discovered his beloved father's secret and questions him in detail about his twisted desires.  The scene is hands-down the most uncomfortable thing I've ever watched.  I was literally squirming...it is so shocking, so obscene and so terribly, terribly sad.  In two minutes, we see how several lives are shattered forever.
Baker's performance should have been nominated for an Oscar, but this would have required too much bravery on the part of the selection commmittee.
Do I recommend the film?  Well, if you aren't afraid to have your limits tested, absolutely.  It has a lot to say, not just about child molestation.  It's well-acted and written, and has many very funny moments too (one character to another:  ""I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you.""  to which the response is: ""I'm not laughing.""  It's from the creator of WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, so you know it's going to be unconventional.  But it is exciting filmmaking.

1220603,4,B00000IC7G,"Most independent films are not sponsored by major film studios because there is 'no market (money)' for them.  Few of these break out.  However, that's even more to reason investigate films that push the limit and Todd Solondz's ""Happiness"" not only does that, it pushes your buttons.  Heaped with plenty of characters with dubious or questionable morals (great actors ensemble), viewers have found pieces of this story either hilarious or repellent, but outrageous in every respect.  ""Happiness"" presents characters of middle America at their rawest and sometimes bleakest moments, making decisions that almost always bring them another difficult hurdle to overcome.
I personally saw this film as hilarious and unbelievably inventive.  Every character is woven in a twisted plot of selfishness or self-awareness.  Sex appears as the main motif and it isn't always pretty.  In fact, Solodnz seems to use it as a tool to both disgust and delight the audience simultaneously.  There's the rub - the viewer never knows quite how to appropriately react - just like most of the characters in the film.  Maybe we see too much of ourselves in this film to make us feel comfortable, but if you can approach it as a black comedy, you may find yourself a little surprised at how humor can sometimes be portrayed.",1046217600,6,1302,5.046728971962617

This is not your ordinary movie and it's delivery is so unique that it just has to strike you as a masterpiece.  The subject matter for many of the story lines is so appaling in some cases that you are just compelled to watch and understand the feelings.  The director was not going for shock value but rather to portray things most refer to as disgusting and putting a human face to them.  I admit I found many of the scenes to be gross and appalling but you don't turn away fromm it instead you think about the characters emotions.  These are everyday normal people who just get caught up in the absurd.

In the end, these pretty, successful, perfect characters still carry the same desperate soul looking for happiness of their misfit relatives - yet end up being bitter and way more unbearable. Memorable Jane Adams and Lara Flynn Boyle - you just can't help loving the first and hating the second.

1220609,5,B00000IC7G,"""Happiness"" tells the story of about twelve characters all looking for happiness, especially three sisters. Joy (Jane Adams) is a single, average, not very attractive but very nice and sensitive woman, employed in a software company. When she manages to find a boyfriend (a Russian thief), she believes she just found love and happiness but the trouble begins. Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle, ""Twin Peaks"", ""Men in Black 2""), just published a useless novel. She has too many boyfriends, which means she doesn't have any. She's aware of the meaninglessness of her life and believes she just found happiness when her neighbor, a sick man, insults her on the phone. Trish (Cynthia Stevenson, ""The Player"") is married to an average American man, with a situation. She believes she's happy, with the ideal family, but she doesn't know that her husband is fond of little boys...
Their father is more reasonable: when his doctor tells him he's gonna live until he's a hundred years old, with the condition of staying away from salt, he just adds more salt in his meals, in order to make his life shorter...
With this third long feature, Todd Solondz, an independent and iconoclast American writer-director, slowly and carefully destroys the goldened image of the average family, not only in the U.S. The result is a real shocker, trashy, hilarious and highly, disturbly realistic. What Sam Mendes (along with his screenwriter, Alan Ball) only suggested in ""American Beauty"", Todd Solondz shows it straight (uncomfort, hypocrisy, vice and vanity in life, especially inside families), dealing with [sexual situations] without putting gloves on. This leads to the hilarious and unstandable scene where the father confesses in front of his son that he's a pervert. Many people compared ""Happiness"" to ""American Beauty"", talking about it as a hard version; but they forgot or didn't know that ""Happiness"" was filmed and released one year before. So actually, ""American Beauty"", it's ""Happiness"" in a soft, sweet way. I even suspect Alan Ball for having taken ""Happiness"" and based upon it to write a gentle version.
The casting is very ecclectic. Dylan Baker and Philip Seymour Hoffman are great as nutcases, Camryn Manheim is very good, and Ben Gazzara, who used to be one of Cassavetes' favorite actors, gets involved in Solondz's universe the most ideal way. With this film, Solondz can easily be compared to Tarantino and ""Pulp Fiction"" from his many portraits and his way to go from one character to another, with talent, competence and control. ""American Beauty"", with Dreamworks behind, its cast of stars and a bunch of Oscars, still doesn't have the strength of Cannes International Film Festival acclaimed (and prized) ""Happiness"", which is about to be a classic. An incredible shocker and a rarer and rarer piece of American cinema work. Some people should see it to understand the world. Very, very special.",1034812800,5,2899,5.092436974789916
1220610,4,B00000IC7G,"""Happiness"" is not a movie for everyone by any means. Personally I thought it was occasionally hilarious, brutally honest about the private lives of unhappy people, and frequently painful to watch. The director goes for maximum discomfort in many scenes which really make you squirm in your seat. If you consider yourself an optimist than this movie might seem stomach-turning and exaggerated and pointlessly misanthropic, and you might understandably despise it. I myself could definitely relate to the characters who are unable to escape the cycle of prolonged periods of self-loathing punctuated by moments of brief relief (although I have no desire to make obscene phone calls or prey on young boys).
There are four loosely related storylines in ""Happiness"". The most memorable one looks at a suburban dad who harbors secret fantasies about prepubescent boys. The striking thing is that the man is presented sympathetically -- he is sick, he knows he's sick, but he has nowhere to turn for help. Even though his actions are repugnant, I still ended up feeling sorry for the man himself. I thought the treatment of the issue was effective and not too apologetic for the man's proclivities; child abusers are rightly reviled by society, but the movie reminds you that the taboo is so strong that there is no place for potential offenders to turn. The focus with sex criminals is punishing them after the fact, but are there any outlets where such people can privately seek help before they succumb to their urges? If there aren't, perhaps there should be.
The other subplots follow a chronic masturbator, a down-on-her-luck woman who is mistreated throughout the movie in ways that straddle the knife-edge between cruelty and humor, and an older couple whose marraige is dissolving. Maybe it's just me, but I thought Ben Gazzara was scene-stealingly funny as the stoic retiree who just wants to be alone.
Anyway, this is a worthwhile movie to see if you are not automatically turned off by the inner lives of desperate people. The uncomfortable scenes force you to think about happiness itself: what is it, who deserves it, and how do I go about getting it anyway?",1034121600,8,2166,4.986187845303867

It is as others have said, ""F'd up"", but that doesn't mean its bad.

If you find yourself laughing at this film and then you feel guilty about it you are not alone.
I stayed up one night until 2:30am attached to this film. It is horribly depressing and none of the characters are remotely likable but you relate to them nonetheless and eventually they manage to win you over. This film sticks in your head and is NC-17 for a reason. It takes a pedophile and a sexually harassing office worker (played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman) and it allows you to see a side of them that is just like yourself.

1220626,1,B00000IC7G,"This film is a must-see for anyone seeking an illustration of Alfred Hitchcock's observation that actors are cattle. You just sit there for two hours agog, wondering what in the world talented performers are doing in a film such as this. You ask yourself Is there no line an actor will draw when offered a role? It really is as though the entire cast have been conditioned not to detect obscenity before walking onto the set.
I am really loath to lower myself to Todd Solonz's level by discussing the (literally) masturbatory  visuals and dialogue, but suffice to say that the movie is indeed explicit to the point of repulsion, and therefore, by modern American artistic standards, must be profound and thought-provoking. You find the sight of a man using his own natural glue to stick postcards to his bedroom wall repulsive? Well, you musn't be thinking hard enough about the deep message of the movie. You're turned off by the sight of a father abusing himself in the back seat of a car while flicking through a children's comic? Well then you musn't be letting the movie challenge your assumptions about yada yada yada ...
It needs to be said plainly. American taste is rapidly descending into a quagmire where the intellectual knee-jerk reaction to obscenity is to immediately, unthinkingly mistake it for profundity. Champions of freedom of expression have sought to make this freedom boundless, such that even what is universally acknowledged to be appalling is given voice, that the demon of censorship may never get a toe-hold. But by now the very act of pushing the envelope of bad taste has itself become a mark of artistic merit, and works that are self-evidently repulsive are considered great for no other reason than that they supposedly reaffirm the sheer breadth of America's freedom of expression.
The point made by almost every advocate of freedom of speech, from Jefferson to Mill, is that suppression of that freedom may exclude us from coming into contact with important ideas. Thus even bad ideas should be given a forum. This is true enough. But that does not mean that the broader the leeway for expression, the more we should jettison our taste and judgement. In fact, the opposite is true: when there is no external quality control, then our own taste and discernment needs to be at its sharpest, to winnow the wheat from the chaff. Happiness clearly crosses a threshold of taste, and when movies such as this are well-received, we are in trouble. But that must just be the repressed prude in me talking. You know - that bad person who doesn't sit back and pensively stroke his chin at the sight of someone masturbating.
When Monsters from the Moon, one of the worst sci-fi B-movies of the 50s was released, one reviewer commented: `Everyone involved with this film deserves censure.'

The rest of the film's elements succeed or don't succeed to various degrees, but the story of Joy (played by Jane Adams) makes the movie such a wonder.
  Joy is beautiful, and not just for being exceptionally easy on the eyes.  She's warm, loving, and kind, and wants to do something selfless with her life.  She's a great woman.
  And naturally, almost everybody she knows treats her like dirt.  I'm not going to describe the various incidents, I'll just say that they are very... cutting.
  There's a scene towards the very beginning of the film that is one of the most powerful that I have ever seen.  Joy is sitting in her cubicle at work, and she gets a couple of phone calls.  Joy isn't working in a Victorian factory, or on a plantation, or in a POW camp or any of the other hellholes humanity has experienced.  In a purely material sense, she's blessed.  And yet in this scene you see that her despair and alienation (and the dehumanization of her working environment) are every bit as unpleasant and spirit-destroying as possible.

1220635,5,B00000IC7G,"I will admit that I prepared myself for the worst going into this film because I knew that as a lover of film, I should see it, but still may not like it.  I was wrong.  This is a brilliant and corrosively funny movie.  It was under the Comedy section in my video store, and while that is not entirely accurate, I don't know where else you would place it.  It is a tale of hapless adults in search of, what else, happiness.  These people may act like you and me, but behind closed doors, they hold terrible dark secrets, as many of us do, but would never tell.  That's what makes this movie frightening; it could be your neighborhood and you don't know it.  But writer-director Todd Solondz paints a sympathetic picture of these people, and that may be the element that offends people.  However, this film is not done crudely, and Solondz does not really go for shock value; he's merely showing what life really is, and how even though some of these people are seriously disturbed, there's a sick humor in watching their pratfalls.  It is indeed hard to explain the comedy in this to someone only familiar with the subject matter, but trust me, it's there.  It is also dramatically powerfully and elegantly filmed.  Solondz has already made himself a true and original voice in 90s cinema with only two major films under his belt (although ""Storytelling"" has also just been released).  This film stunned me, shocked me, and struck me with its brilliance.  Any film that can succeed comedically and dramatically with this type of  heavy material is in my opinion, a remarkable film.",1015200000,3,1581,4.620071684587813

I had heard so much about its more controversial elements, but I had no idea it would be quite so hateful. This said, I did not hate the movie as a viewer at all. At times I was shocked by some of its more unsavoury storylines, but I was captivated by how the darker elements of human nature are so pervasive. We just do not always notice them in reality. This film examines those darker parts of humanity by exacerbating them and looking past the veneer of ""pretty and perfect"" nuclear families. Many people who watch this film WILL hate it. Many will be highly offended. Some will be perplexed and moved to thought. All the actors here give outstanding performances as people who lead seemingly normal lives but who have secrets and edges to their personalities which make them more... human. Sometimes these flaws and faults make them positively disgusting people. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as a prank-phone-calling pervert with a whiny but monotone voice. He lusts after his neighbour, played with an icy touch by a self-absorbed Lara Flynn Boyle (the role does not seem much of a stretch for her). When Hoffman begins phoning Boyle, she insists they have to meet so he can do all the obscene things to her that he talks about doing in his prank phone calls. When they do, she immediately says, ""This isn't working."" Another tenant in their building, played manically well by Boyle's The Practice co-star Camryn Mannheim, lusts after Hoffman and comes to his door nightly to report minutiae about various other tenants in the building. Hoffman is blind to her feelings and rejects her. Until finally she confesses nonchalantly to having murdered their doorman. The film, with characters and scenes like these, can be at once horrifying and also heartbreaking. Meanwhile, Boyle's character has two sisters, one (played well by Jane Adams, whom we have seen in Frasier and in Wonder Boys) an aimless sort who cannot keep a job and cannot fall in love and even when she thinks she does, one bad things after another happens. The other sister is played by Cynthia Stevenson, who might best be remembered for playing a similar role in tv's short-lived Hope and Gloria (she was the irrepressible and always positive Hope). Her character believes she has the perfect, stable life with a psychologist husband, a wonderful son, and a nice house. Little does she know, and this is how depraved the characters in the film are, her husband is a pedophile, and he drugs one of his son's friends in order to molest him. By the end of the film, of course, all of these illusions fall apart. But the characters' lives go on, just like life does.",1014076800,10,2722,4.696652719665272

  Yes, horrible things happen in this movie.  Guess what?  Horrible things happen in real life.  I think the whole point of this movie was to show some people trying to be happy, but going about it in all the wrong ways.  I think another thing that bothers most people about this movie is that most of the characters are presented (initially) as ""normal"" people, but we end up seeing them for ""horrible, depraved sickos"" that they are.  The problem lies in the ""fact"" that depraved sickos aren't allowed to be ""normal.""  We're ""normal.""  Depraved sickos wear hockey masks and do horrible things like in those other movies.

Whereas others seem to be able to sympathise with Bill Maplewood, or pity him,  I'd be more inclined to sympathise his son's friend.  All things considered, the kid has not much of a hope for the future.
I give this movie a very high rating but stress that it is not at all enjoyable.  It shows us things we'd rather not see, and every single character could actually exist, and probably does.

  great writing and directing from solondz. thats pretty much all i can say about him, he has always been good and will continue to be good. this movie is better than welcome to the dollhouse on many scales, perhaps due to the scenes with dylan bakers character which keeps us glued to the screen. word of advice, somthing i  noticed about all of the other reviews given on this movie, the couch scene with the pedophile and his son was probably the most disturbing, blindsiding, and brilliant scene i have viewed in a while. for the advice, don't see this movie unless you want to be absolutely shocked with the climax of this film. i am not easily amused or caught off guard by movies, but the couch scene had me telling the screen i couldn't believe what i just witnessed. he doesnt do anything physically to his son instead he answers honestly and calmly and the last thing he tells his son is so outrageously absurd, yet we get the feeling he is just telling the truth. disturbing. brilliant. indellible. go see this movie.",1008028800,4,1960,4.6753623188405795

The truly remarkable part of this film is that the characters are real; not the ""lovable"" and innocent Joy (a character I despised) or the perky and stereotypical middle class wife (a flat character throughout), but the supposedly bad characters.  The pedophile (played excellently by Dylan Baker) and Hoffman's phone stalker are both normal, sympathetic people.  They're not monsters that live a life of drugs and sin as these types of characters are often portrayed.  What people don't like about this movie, I suspect, is its truth: pedophiles and the like are real people who very well could be the well dressed person next door.  They have problems, yes, but they're still human, and it's refreshing to see a movie portray them as such (it does not glorify them at all, though).

The movie is very intense, but somewhat long. There are a lot of scenes that could be excluded making the plot more concise and powerful. In general the story line is interesting, but the pedophilia subject, takes the focus off the main characters and puts it on the father. When this happens, the story is no longer the same. Nothing matters much anymore: phone sex, rape or anything, they all become secondary. In fact it's no longer about (un)happiness, but rather about perversion. But the director seems to ignore this and keeps tackling the subject as happiness or it's lack.
However, he almost manages to save things near the end, in the living room scene, and in the bed scene (where two pitiful characters end up not quite together). But then the final scene (except for the salt--keep your eye on that), ruins the end if not the whole story: it's just void--it has no meaning. It might have tried to represent the ultimate failure, but it comes out as mere emptiness: did it mean anything for the kid at all? Why did he cry in the living room, then?
No, right now this movie feels just like a rough draft that didn't get any polishing. It's true, life is not polished, but art--even as blunt as this--should be. If not it means nothing.",1000339200,3,1442,4.465909090909091

The first is the scene where Dylan Baker confesses to his son that he is a pedophile. This scene will simply break your heart. And the second scene which I love is when, near the end, Ben Gazzara puts salt on his food. I'm not gonna reveal why this is such a powerful scene. Watch the movie, and find out why. Happiness has been criticized by many people for being too disturbing, and for dealing with topics that shouldn't be dealt with (pedophilia, for instance).

No, we don't need this film banned and all involved blacklisted (as one US reviewer stated)...Nor do we need to consider reviews by people who could only make it half-way through this film (one reviewer left the movie after the openning scene and had the NERVE to leave a scathing review!).
Enough ranting...this is one film you will NOT forget.  Funny, shocking, sad--it's all here.  You will find yourself cringing at several points throughout the film.  A lot of ugly imagery and a lot of ugly characters populate this movie, but such is life!
This made a lot of critics' ""best of"" for 1998, although I'm not sure I agree (although maybe I do...1998 was a long time ago).
Anyway, one of the criticisms raised is that the pedophile in the movie is portrayed ""sympathetically""....well, ya know what, folks, not all child molesters look/act like one-eyed ogres.
The film touches on a lot of things that many of us have been through (late-life divorce, dreams of adventure outside our boring lives, teenage sexual confusion, etc.).  I think this may be why so many people are horrified by this film.
I've read more than one review that stated that the children in this film were abused in the process of making it...perhaps they were watching The Exorcist and not Happiness.  I can think of no other explanation for that conclusion.
If you can handle a film that seems uneven in its mood (shock, then humor, then empathy, etc.), and you have a taste for unusual cinema (again, Erin Brockovish is NOT unusual), this might be one of your favorites.

However, if you're into films that challenge your perceptions of the world around you, this is it! Honestly this movie was one of the best I've ever seen. Yes it did crack me up many times (Philip S. Hoffman's and Jon Lovits' characters were particularly pathetic and hysterically pitiful). In fact, the general ""badness"" or ""sadness"" of all the characters in this movie had to make you laugh...it's insane to think that the world is made up of picture perfect Beaver Cleaver families. To me the most crucial scene was the father's ""confession"" to his son...an incredibly powerful scene which was beautifully done. What I loved most about this movie is that every character was developed as complex, 3D human beings...unlike so many other movies which really simplify their characters. No, this is not a glorification of obscene phone callers, pedophiles, and adulterers...it's a comedy which uncovers some unhappy aspects of ""happy"" peoples' lives.

There's a little something for all of us, and, as many people say, you'll probably either love this movie for its unforgiving look at peoples lives and loves, or you'll hate it for showing you what you don't want to see.
Solondz made some great choices in casting the film, allowing Philip Seymour Hoffmann to once again transform himself, this time into Allen, the bumbling, boring, and phonesex-obsessed oaf.

Solondz is not only out to shock you, but to make the viewer realize that these subjects he portrays in the film are actually happening. There are pedofiles out there, maybe nextdoor to you, maybe in your family. Children are thinking about masturbation at a young age. Relationships are ending in divorce. Happiness shows how cold people can be in  today's society. This film will make you wince in some scenes, as well as laugh your head off. Most of the humor in my opinion comes from the music score. The film has all this chaos going on, and the music comes in as if everything is peachy, but isn't that how society is? People put on a mask from reality to hide their demons from the general public.

However, the director, Todd Solondz,  didn't seem to quite know whether to play this film for comedy or pathos and most of it is not funny, just sick and depressing.

Happiness tells the interweaving tales of miserable people in miserable lives, failing miserably in their attempts to live out their dreams of happiness.  Some of the characters are shallow, others deluded, and still others inhuman sociopaths.  But what is remarkable about Solondz's writing and direction is that even the most reprehensible characters are painted with warm tones of humanity.  A compulsive pedophile is also a loving father.  An aggressive obscene phone caller is just a frail man who wants to be loved, but doesn't know how to reach out to others.

Yet it is quite interesting to watch, in a car wreck sort of way.  The triumph of Happiness is not its abrasiveness, or its shock value.  It is the fact that the movie forces you to sympathize with the people who are the most morally reprehensible, and hate those who you'd probably socialize with in real life.  At the end of the movie, you find yourself feeling sorry for the pedophile and hating Lara Flynn Boyle's pretentious yet morally neutral character.
Happiness is about a group of people whose gratification lay just outside their reach, as if doomed to live a life that could never make them happy.  One of the sisters couldn't be sweeter or more well meaning, but she ends up with a parade of loser men who abuse her in one way or another.  A pedophile with a family, a writer who wants to be raped but of course, can not invite sex and write about being raped, a woman who is not loved by her husband, nor is divorced from him...none of these people can grasp what would ultimately make them happy.
Though much of this sort of draws you in, there are some problems here.  First, I have to say I find this movie almost too depressing.  There is simply not one moment when you feel at ease with what is going on.  Secondly, it's too incredible.  That these people are so out of whack, and that they are all related as well, is just too much of a reality stretch.  The feeling of the movie is that this in someway applies to many of us, but the way it is portrayed in Happiness is so exaggerated you find yourself distancing rather than embracing the message.

From the uncomfortable discussions between Bill Maplewood and his curious son to Philip Seymour Hoffman's twisted fascination with female voices, this movie never pulls punches. All of Solondz choices are justified and needed to propel this story forward; nothing is gratuitous when you realize he is being true to his characters.

1220699,2,B00000IC7G,"I really tried to like this film because I have read rave reviews about it, but it did nothing for me.  The film is known to be quite controversial, and I respect it for that because I admire films which question peoples opinions.  Yet the only thing that offended me about the film is how dull it is.  The pace is very slow, a lot of scenes drag on for ages and barely anything happens in the first hour or so.  The worst aspect though, is the characters, they really are a hideous group of people and the type of people you have nightmares about being stuck in a lift with.  They are dull, boring, creepy, pathetic and unlikeable, and you never feel any attachment towards them.  The cinematography is very flat and makes the film resemble a TV movie more than a arthouse picture.  The script is also very bad and seems to be written by someone who hasn't a clue how ordinary people talk and act.  This film isn't a total disaster, it brings up some important issues towards the end, and I must mention that the acting is very good especially the excellent performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
This is the type of film in which a lot of people will say they like it to look cool and to avoid looking like a fan of brainless Hollywood action films.  Well to be honest, I have a varied taste in films, from big budget blockbusters to no-budget arthouse films, and I'm going to be hideously uncool by saying that this film is a tedious look at the lives of a group of losers and a chore to sit through",972086400,5,1502,4.297872340425532

The first and only movie director to have a writer character finally NOT wear black, should win the NOBEL PRIZE for ORIGINALITY and NOT SUCCUMBING to dumb stereotypes.

What galled me about Happiness was not its unflinching look at perversions, but its complete lack of plot or point.  My friends and I watched this movie for what seemed like 4 hours to find that no, it hadn't been following any sort of narrative thrust.
The second flaw is the more deadly of the two (Pulp Fiction didn't really have a plot, and it was great).  Solondz doesn't seem to have anything interesting to say, here, except ""life sucks, doesn't it?"" Every character is miserable and perverted in one way or the other; the overall effect is less revelation than tedious repetition.  Solondz presents us with reprehensible characters doing disgusting things in seedy environments over and over again . . . it's about as revelatory as listening to fingernails on a chalkboard, and equally as pleasant.
This isn't some exploration into the heart of mankind, it's superficial shock for shock's sake, uninventful exploitation. I can't bring myself to praise it simply because it offended people -- so did Showgirls, and Happiness has the same cheap heart.  END",967593600,5,1150,4.973958333333333
1220714,5,B00000IC7G,"This is one of those films that suddenly hit you, when you don't expect it. I would say that Happiness is a film in a Robert Altman style but with  a very realistic touch. Altman's films are maybe less realistic because you  recognize those famous actors and that's exactly the feeling that I did not  have while watching Happiness. The film is very realistic and authentic to  me, the way the actors mold their character and the way they relate to the  others is superb and very non-selfish from an actor's point of view. What I  am trying to say here, is that this is one of those rare films in which you  can see people playing other people without noticing it's all worked out in  a script. I'd like to mention David Lynch's masterwork, 'the Straight  story', in which Sissy Spacek plays this stuttering daughter in a way that  can only be described as heartbreaking realistic and very heartwarming at  the same time. Some of the characters in Happiness did the same to me and  that makes me say that this movie is a must-see. Although every viewer  should be warned that there are some shocking moments and images, but they  are all in place where they belong if you can take it. It is a movie about  ordinary people living their ordinary, sometimes average life, and the way  they are connected to eachother. Sometimes not knowing that they are  connected, or will be connected at a certain moment in time, maybe in a  certain place or brought together by people they both know. In this way,  Happiness has some parallels with Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts', but  Happiness stands out as a shocking, sometimes even funny but very present  day in-depth look into people and their lives.

1220715,4,B00000IC7G,"There's no doubt that Todd Solondz is an immensely talented writer/director who doesn't shy away from making films filled with  damaged,empty,disgusting characters. The type of person who has the facade  of success but who are really just wasting away. It makes me uncomfortable  and uneasy admitting that i thoroughly enjoyed this film,but i definitely  did. What does that say about me that i thought this was a brilliantly  written,directed,and acted film that entertained from start to finish. Some  reviewers say that Solondz exploited and took pleasure in the characters'  hopelessness and evil acts,and i agree he crossed the line in some scenes  and went into unnecessary detail with regards to sexually explicit  conversations Dylan Baker's character would have with his son played by  Justin Elvin. I can't defend those aspects of the story as i believe they  were utilized for sheer tittilation. Some things do not have to be said,and  a more mature director would have found a way to broach some of this  subject matter,which i feel is very important,without going into graphic  detail. A movie called ""The War Zone"" dealt with similar themes  but with more sublety and class. It's scary that there are pedophiles who  will watch this film and get excited by some of these scenes and  dialogue. It's Solondz responsibility as an director and person to avoid  glamorizing pedophilia in the guise of simply pointing it out. The rest of  the characters aren't as sickening as Baker's but there still  revolting. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a virtual hermit whose social life  consists almost entirely of making random obscene phone calls to women  and,well,you know the rest. Jane Adams is a confused young women who just  can't get it right with men. She consistently picks men who will use her for  sex,or whatever else they may want. Lara Flynn Boyle(the Joker's main  squeeze)plays her sister,a woman with ice in her vains and vanity that  knows no bounds. The third sister,played by Cynthia Stevenson,is the loving  housewife,who loves her husband so much she doesn't realize what a  vile,disgusting creature he is,and that he's a sexual predator of young  boys. Jon Lovitz in a brief cameo plays a jilted lover in the opening  scene,a scene i feel is one of the funniest in the film. Ben Gazzara and  Louise Lasser play the parents of the three sisters. It's the typical  married couple don't excite each other anymore sexually subplot i've seen  countless times before. It's the weakest link in the film. What i was left  with was that if you love someone too much you might fail to see how  degenerate and evil they've become,and that when you finally except who you  are ,that even a sad sack or lost soul can find ""Happiness"".If  you can overlook some absolutely disgusting dialogue this film delivers the  goods.

An unflinching look  at what goes on behind closed doors. An amazing ""white knuckle  ride"". People have compared this movie to American Beauty, but that's  like comparing The Return of the Secaucus Seven to The Big Chill. American  Beauty isn't a bad film, but it's Hollywood's idea of a family on the fast  track to destruction. Happiness shows us the worst case scenario of family  life. After seeing this film, you'll see the family in American Beauty as  the Cleavers. Yes, this movie is shocking, but it's OK to be shocking as  long as you have a good reason. Todd Solondz has the best reason to shock  us - he won't to wake us up.

There's a guy who makes random explicit phone calls to women  while he pleases himself. There's a woman who tries hard to make herself  happy. But she always picks the wrong road.

The film  intriguingly has sympathetic characters ie the saintlike Joy who remains  optimistic and wants to help others despite the truly horrid way she is  treated, the Camyrn Manheim character is strangley endearing, as is the  Doctor's son. On the other hand, we have Bill the pedophile, and the cold  cruel sister portrayed by the anorexic Boyle, who is so PERFECT for the  witchy role.  The film strikes a resounding chime of truth as it examines  how we try to find happiness and end up missing it, every time. The film is  a study in irony, and though it goes for the gross out EVERY time you can  think of, its believeable. Above all, the film has that rare blend of truly  black comedy we witnessed in Dollhouse.",960854400,4,929,4.536144578313253

I did like this movie for its examination of  happiness ( and the lack thereof) in general.  In many ways, Solondoz's  insight into this elusive emotion has mirrored  my own. For instance- how  some people automatcally pretend that they are happier than they really  are, just to bring others arround them down.  I'm nowhere near a PhD, but  there is some deep underlying fear of being the more miserable than the  person next to you.  By acting happier than you are, others can and do feel  more miserable by comparison,  then posssibly falling victim to  self-fullfiling prophecy.  Its an insidious and unconscience  part of human  nature.
  ' Welcome to the Dollhouse' was funnier and less disgusting ,  but happiness poses some important questions.  Some will be too offended  (and therefore distracted) to recognize or ponder the them.",959990400,,1011,4.993939393939394

A  taste of life on the wrong side of the tracks. And that is what is so  provoking about this movie, the fact that it is real. These could be real  people. This movie could be taking place over at the apartment complex down  the street, for all you know. That's actually one of the themes of the  movie, not paying attention to people (and subsequently not missing them  when they die). You will get caught up in the lives of each of the  characters, wondering where they'll go next.
Be, of course, forewarned:  this movie deals with masturbation (complete with semen onscreen),  pedophilia (nothing explicit, thankfully), sex, and rape. It's not exactly  family fare. But it's a good movie.",959904000,3,978,4.627906976744186
1220721,4,B00000IC7G,"Realizing that many people don't like the subject of child molestation and rape, director Todd Solondz took a gamble.  The people that do appreicate his honest direct and down right blunt intrepretation of a psychologically  distrubed man, and the laughably sad portrayal of another family, like this  movie because it gives them a type of empathy that they never thought they  could have.
This movie is touching because you find yourself caught up  in the lives of perverted individuals, and you see there struggles.  This  movie was like watching a car accident.  You don't want anyone to get hurt,  but you can't help but watch in anticipation.  And you don't want to see a  mangled body, but in a way the accident wouldn't be as astonishing if no on  died.  Similarly, no one wants to see a child get molested or raped, but  you can't help but wonder what makes a person do these things. Truth can  give empathy, this movie does!
Even if you think it is sick, you leave  the movie wondering how did you get these feeling of sorrow for the  pedaphile.  That to me indicates a strong movie, and one that should be  explored by viewers.  Movies should be a way to view life that is different  from how you live, and they should give you insight to a world that has  endless possibilities.

There was an insane level of gratuitous nastiness that put me off from the start of the movie.  I did  enjoy that, unlike a lot of Hollywood movies, it did have a plot that was  beyond average.  The movie was daring enough to go beyond socially  acceptable norms, but perhaps it should have done so a little less  graphically.  I think that when a viewer is faced with blatant dysfunction  in every character it is very disturbing, and that definitely happens in  this movie.

The three sisters were each quite screwed up in their own way, yet  thinking that they had it all.  Trish was the ultimate housewife but yet  she couldn't satisfy her husband, not that that was necessarily her fault  because he was a pedophile, but she looked down upon Joy for not having a  husband and children.  Helen was the most shallow person.  The scene with  those two sisters in the restaurant with each of them condescending the  other one under the guise of compliments and envy all the while trashing  Joy is the perfect example of how stupid they both were.  Joy did not  really have any truly bad qualities but she was so unlikable because she  was such a doormat.  The two leading men in the movie were both obsessed  with fantasies of having power over their sexual partners.  I really felt  that this whole movie was just the makers trying to shock their audience.  It felt like they were just trying to see how far they could go with an ""R""  rating.

I'm in the middle.  It was not a movie that I would  watch again, however, it was a movie I could bare to watch all the way  through.  I think this movie showed the realities of life and sometimes we  hate to face reality.  We don't like to think of stalkers or pedophiles are  average citizens like ourselves.  This movie did succeed in its shock  value.  To make a movie memorable, sometimes the director chooses to show  scenes that are not necessary.  In terms of remembering, this is a movie  that will be hard to forget.  To me, the movie ""American  Pie"" was disturbing because of the subject matter that was sometimes  talked about.  After watching this movie, I realize that ""American  Pie"" was tame compared to this.  This brought the subject matter of  sex to a different level and from different directions.  There is a  character who stalks females over the phone and says lewd sexual comments  to them.  Another character enjoys having sex with young boys.  One  character has sex just for the fun of it while never having commit.  While  the subject of sex has always been something private and not really  discussed, movies are bringing up the subject in full force.  At some  points, it seemed like sex was the central subject matter for all the  characters.  I think the hardest part of watching this movie was seeing how  this subject matter was just brought out into the open.  The humorous  scenes lightened the mood of the movie.  It made you forget about the dark  subject matters this film was about.  This movie could've been dark and  disturbing, but the writer created the atmosphere to make it seem like  something some American families must go through.  The actors did a good  job in their portrayal of their characters.  They were able to make the  characters believable.  And while it's hard to understand how a family can  be this way, we have to realize that families are all dysfunctional in  their own way.",958608000,5,2113,4.62125340599455

There are a few comedic moments, which just remind the audience of the serious material the film is trying to portray.  ""Happiness"" depicts the reality  of society, no matter how harsh it may seem.  There isn't any hidden truth  or light heartedness involved in any of the characters.  There lives are  realistically torn apart, affecting everyone in the family.  This may be  too disturbing for people to watch and it could also offend people, but  they're living in a naive world.  There are sick and desperate people  living in this world and people need to accept it.  The emotional suffering  could be considered exaggerated because it affects every character, but  that's the best way for the audience to get the point.  This film is a  broader social commentary on what really does exist in the world, no matter  how disgusting it may seem.  The overall social commentary of disturbing  truths enlightens the audience, either by their expression of disgust or  praise.  The actors' involved in this production did a spectacular job with  the disturbing material they were given to work with.  Each character was  portrayed as it was meant to be, fitting with the reality of the film.

I have found that my taste in movies usually involves off the wall types of movies, such as,  Being Jon Malkovich, Drowning Mona, and Waiting For Guffman.  Of course,  none of these movies deal with severe issues such as child molestation, but  they all have something about them which makes them unique, just as  Happiness has about it.  I don't find Happiness to be any different than a  movie like Schindler's List or American History X.  All of these movies  face harsh realities of life.  They are meant for people to watch and  remind themselves that awful things do happen in our society.  Happiness  may not be a specific true story, but it tells about everyday people that  continue to live their lives without anyone else noticing that they really  are not happy.  I also liked this movie because of the irony.

This movie was made for profit, and  nothing sells better than shock value.  This movie was made for an audience  that wants to go in to a theater sit down and watch a shockingly, horribly,  depressing movie for two hours and leave.  As soon as the movie is over the  audience can leave the theater, go home and realize that their lives aren't  that bad.  Of course this movie is shocking and gross, but no one would  bother seeing this movie if it wasn't.  No one would go and see Happiness  if it were a mellow film about a group of people who had fulfilling,  healthy, relationships.  It wouldn't be interesting, and wouldn't be able  to hold our attention.  What makes people cringe about this movie is  that it highlights what is most negative in our society.  Yes, in our  society there are pedophiles molesting children.  Yes, there are a lot of  people in bad relationships.  People are unhappy.  Happiness uses these  depressing aspects of our society and magnifies them; they are then used as  a device to strike a chord in people.  All the characters were made  to be too demented.  Each character's dementia was heightened so much that  it made the whole movie almost laughable.  An example of this is the sweet  woman down the hall who we find out kills the doorman, cuts up his body and  stores it in the refrigerator.  It's ridiculous, how can anyone take this  film seriously?  Happiness deals with depressing realistic situations that  do occur in life; but this movie is as contrived as any action movie and  shouldn't be taken too seriously.",958521600,,1670,4.6116838487972505

Great now i can watch the news but in a two hour film!  The  movie is offensinve and makes many realize that the world we live in is  very disturbing, there is no point arguing that fact. But many other  reviewers stated that it is a taste of what goes on next door and they were  captivated by it and makes us as the viewers face this reality.  Granted it  does this but did it have to do it so graphically and with such disgust? Is  a movie really that good if it makes us feel grossed out and disturbed?  Is  a film genius just because its on a subject matter that hollywood would not  diplay regularly?How much shock value deos one movie need to get the point  across?  Really with a plot and cast like it had the director(who obviously  did not get hugged alot as a child)could have done much more than attack  the viewer and our senses with sooooo many graphic images.  State the  issue, yes!  Make a point, great!  But leave all that other visual and  demented images out.

1220729,5,B00000IC7G,"This film is truly a classic to be remembered.  People in our American society are so afraid to talk about anything sex-related, including masturbation, molestation and just the beauty of making love.  This movie  explores these topics and more, some of which is offensive to close-minded  or easily offended individuals .  However I feel strongly that this movie  should be seen by anyone who has an open mind to the many realities of our  society.  This movie shows the reality of our American culture that people  are often seeing on the news or in magazines in a sugar coated form.  This  movie removes that sugar coated sensationalism and portrays the true  meaning of the word dysfunctional.  Throughout the movie there are  several families and characters who in one way are all connected to each  other, going through different problems, such as divorce, cheating, and low  self-esteem.  I like how the movie is not afraid to touch sensitive topics,  it challenges the morals, values and beliefs of any individual.  I really  believe that this movie can open your mind to some of the extremes in our  society, hopefully expanding your view on the diverse (not talked about)  events in our world.  I strongly recommend this film to people who  are not afraid and open-minded enough to be subjected to a broad spectrum  of sexual and dysfunctional events, ranging from the positive notions of  love making and masturbation and the immoral negative ideas of child  molestation, divorce and other things.",958521600,5,1508,4.975806451612903

I understand the meaning  behind it, which is a good meaning, people are different behind the scenes,  everyone wears a mask. That's what this movie is about. Yes it's sick...is  that wrong?

1220731,5,B00000IC7G,"Taking risks that most filmmakers would never dream of, Todd Solondz has mangaged a rare feat in American film -- pushing the envelope of good taste without resorting to sophomoric shock humor while simultaneously creating  realistic, complex characters. The film will no doubt offend many, but  unlike the overwrought preachiness of many in Hollywood, Solondz respects  the intelligence of the audience to come to their own conclusions. Because  Americans tend to lean in the direction of self-righteousness and moral  absolutism, we are left aghast when we witness a film that refrains from  judgment. In addition, Solondz has created a film of unprecedented power  and black humor, where loneliness and desperation are treated with the  proper level of seriousness that so many films avoid. To be sure, there are  big laughs in this film, but they come from our collective recognition  rather than the belief that we are superior to the people on the screen.  Every scene works perfectly; every performance contains the precise mixture  of dignity and absurdity; and all is presented with the understanding that  easy answers and forced closure are not parts of life, therefore they  should remain absent from film. As a viewer, ask yourself one question:  Given that all human beings are united in the desire to love, be loved, and  express affection for another, what are those not ""blessed"" with  socially acceptable traits (wealth, beauty, strength, even sanity) supposed  to do? How do they capture that essential part of life? This film dares to  ask that question and in many ways, provide disturbing answers.",956793600,8,1619,5.181467181467181

Solondz takes filmmaking to the next level.  What's  great about this movie?  The colors, first of all.  Notice that everyone's  clothes, every scene is painted in bright, summery colors as if trying to  brighten up the mood of the film.  All of the characters are over the top  (Phillip Seymour Hoffman is unbelievable), but that's what makes it fun.  These are people that could be living next door to you, if only you knew  all of their secrets.

Unfortunately this was not the case in  ""Happiness"" and the viewer is left with a handfull of characters  with no substance.  Another problem I have with this movie is how it has  been seen by many as a knock-you-out drama. Hard-hitting, intense, movies  are hard-hitting and intense because throughout the picture, the viewer  discovers something about themselves they never knew before. This film  doesn't give the viewer a chance to do this. One can't find something  hidden in themselves if he or she can not see these feelings within the  characters.

Of course there is a lot of garbage in the human life and human nature but it  takes a strong person to live through it and make it better instead of  concenttrating on this with a sick pleasure. I do not agree that art is  necessarily dark and hopeless and to create art film you have to ""tell  the truth"". Yes, people do go through the bad times in  their lifes - it's a common knowledge. But what is the point of throwing it  back to their faces? To show that you are sophisticated and  familiar with  the disgusting aspects of life?

As the story runs, there are scores of  intense dramatic situations that enthrall the audience. But days after  watching the film, for me, the questions that it poses are fresh and  unresolved.

This film goes where no film has  dared even think about going in the past, completely redefing the term  ""black comedy"".  The movie intertwines several loosely related  plotlines(a la Pulp Fiction), all involving outwardly banal suburban  characters whose private lives are actually teeming with depravity and  tragedy, ineptitude and self-loathing.  The film is at its most audacious  when following the trials and tribulations of an average suburban  psychologist who also just happens to be a homosexual pedophile.  In this  particular storyline, Solondz takes this repellent figure, this Grendel of  modern society, and exposes his life in such tragically comic and  crushingly depressing tones as to make you reevaluate your initial  preconceived notions of the John  Wayne Gaycie's of the world.  This film  has the singular distinction of containing the only scene in which i felt  the urge to laugh, vomit, and cry simultaneously.  If you are a prude or a  moralizing, close-minded fundamentalist of one type or another, you will  probably find this movie ""filthy"" and ""morally  bankrupt"".

7909816,4,B00000IC7G,"An Indie Movie that looks like a Hollywood one, HAPPINESS (1998) is one of those Slice-of-life movies thats like a cross between 1989s PARENTHOOD and AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999). Like the latter, some dark themes are filtered through the sunny faade of suburban perfection. The film seems obsessed with sexual repression, self-pleasure and the idea that true happiness is all-elusive. All the scripted TV dramas about dysfunctional families of this century can be traced back to this film, so for that alone it deserves credit for being a template.

HAPPINESS is also notable for its completely blas attitude toward pedophilia, rape, murder, dismemberment. All these subjects are handled in a matter-of-fact way and not sensationalized which makes the tone unique, especially since everything is presented with such a bright, sunny sheen.

The eclectic (to say the least) cast includes Louise Lasser (hilarious at first but sort of peters out), Philip Seymour Hoffman (who is excellent as the sweaty, twitchy, sexually frustrated obscene caller), Ben Gazzara, Carmryn Manheim, Jon Lovitz, Lara Flynn Boyle, and even Marla Maples for Gods sake!

This film was the follow-up to writer-director Todd Solondzs WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE which has a cult following, but just didn't do it for me. HAPPINESS shares the same New Jersey setting as DOLLHOUSE which tried too hard to be quirky but fell flat. HAPPINESS manages to be quirkier AND more polished and thus, is the better film. The ten-years-after sequel LIFE DURING WARTIME (2009) features every role recast and the new stories are not as compelling; they try to copy from the superior first film way too much. It too features an interesting cast, but some of the replacements are way too different to be believable (substituting Paul Pee Wee Reubens for Jon Lovitz? HELLO?). Alison Janney just cant do optimistic as well as Cynthia Stevenson did and don't get me started on Ally Sheedy. But I digress, HAPPINESS rates a solid FOUR STARS.",1524960000,,1983,5.13312693498452
7909817,5,B00000IC7G,Great and disturbing movie all in one with multiple stories in and out through movie. The acting is perfect but the subject matter may turn some off but it's real non the less. This is my favorite Phillip Seymour Hoffman performance and Dylan Baker performance is awesome eventhough his story is VERY DISTURBING AND DISCUSSING!!! But that is what Todd Solondz movies usually are real stories about real people and sometimes the ugliness of those people,1523750400,,452,4.9605263157894735

7909819,1,B00000IC7G,"I can't believe someone recommended this to me.  I'm rethinking my friendship.  This movie may appeal to you if you are a bit twisted.
If you like it you may want to see a professional about a possible disorder.  So I guess its good as a personality test?
Sorry I don't have more details about what I didn't like but that's because I don't want to relive it.  Other negative reviews can fill in the blanks.",1514160000,,406,4.302631578947368

7909823,5,B00000IC7G,I am giving a standing ovation threw out this whole review. Every actor is this film is a somebody today. The cast is diamond strong. Everything feel real and nothing is forced at all. The writing..... the writing is impeccable. Who ever thought this is a Genius. Yes everything in the film is wrong and messed up. But the way it's protrade is meticulous to say the least. They cover so many topics that and uncomfortable and morbid to say the least. And the talks between the father and the sun were bizarre and might be the funniest thing I've ever seen. And one of the best endings of all time hands down. If your twiztid and have a dark sense of humour and can handle ALOT of awkward moments. Check this out RIGHT NOW! 10 outta 10!!!!,1494460800,5,738,4.355072463768116
7909824,5,B00000IC7G,Delightfully dark comedy! Just like most of Todd Solondz films this one doesn't disappoint! Just the opening alone featuring Jon Lovits will have you cracking up if you got a sick sense of humor. Watch this!!!!!!,1494201600,,212,4.916666666666667
