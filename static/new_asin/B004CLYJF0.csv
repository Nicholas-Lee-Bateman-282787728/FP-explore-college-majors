4327866,3,B004CLYJF0,"The Plymouth Adventure is the story of the Mayflower and of a group of brave men and women sailing to a New World to practice their religion, to make money, and to get away from their lives in Europe. They are led by a strict and unsympathetic captain (Spencer Tracy) who does all he can to ensure their survival on the journey.

A historical adventure with moments of excitement, this movie never quite gets going. We are expected to like Van Johnson, a youthful carpenter who joins the Mayflower just before it sails, and a beautiful wife (Gene Tierney) of one of the leaders of the passengers who is eyed by every sailor on board.

This is an MGM film, and what would such a film be without a love story? It is really just thrown in as an afterthought, but the relationship between Tracy and Tierney is too little too late to spice up the story. The men are the ones who get a chance to really act; Tierney has little to do but look beautiful.

The picture quality is not great; this film could really use a proper restoration.",1327017600,,1030,4.382198952879581
4327867,5,B004CLYJF0,"We completely enjoyed this movie.  It makes one appreciate what the early settlers went through to begin this great nation.  I hope we never forget the hand of the Lord in guiding our forefathers & those who suffered in behalf of freedom to worship as they may, & have private ownership in our lives today.",1324598400,6,306,4.545454545454546
4327868,4,B004CLYJF0,"This movie received an Oscar in 1952 for Best Effects / Special Effects.  Well worth it.  The story centers on the group of brave men and women who travelled westward for a new life.  We all know that story.  But what is interesting, and albeit i am sure some liberty was taken, was the conditions in the hold of the ship for these passengers, and the unique use of the printing press.  I love the old movies and this one was the first I had seen of it, and for history and genealogy buffs, an interesting film to watch.",1324252800,,520,4.212121212121212
4327869,4,B004CLYJF0,"A film that transports the spectator to an other era. Excelent costumes, ships, realistically dirty and threadbare crew. With an ecxelent interpetation by Spencer Tracy ( the captain ), an ecxelent interpretation by Gene Tierney ( a beautiful passenger )and Introducing a very beautiful ingenui ( Dawn Addams ). Its weak spot is in my opinion the lack of action. It is alleged by  its title to be an adventure after all. The fact that the mere hint of an illicit love-affaire between Tracy and Tierney ends so tragically and the prudish moral message ,that the film delivers, are frustrating even by the standards of the early '50's.",1306368000,,633,4.861111111111111
4327870,4,B004CLYJF0,"Fairly good dramatic account of the voyage itself.  Attention to physical detail on board the ship and the rigors of life under sail.  Costumes are accurate.  The tensions between the pilgrams and the ship's company is handled with considerable creative license.  The story ends with the Mayflower's return to England and there is no account of how the passengers fared in the New World (half of them died the next year). A reasonably good account of the trip itself, which was miserable, wet and cold.",1290211200,7,502,4.870588235294117
4327871,1,B004CLYJF0,"Plymouth Adventure is pure fiction. The genocide of the Indians is left out, naturally, as is the internecine greed and hatred amongst the passengers.

To be avoided.",1290211200,,166,5.148148148148148
4327872,3,B004CLYJF0,"""Plymouth Adventure"" is just about the only Pilgrim movie I can think of (I'm not counting the various ""Scarlet Letter""s and Salem Witch movies--those are about Puritans already settled in the New Land, not the Pilgrims just coming over). It's not really a bad movie, but it's not really a good one either. Stellar cast: Spencer Tracy as Capt Jones, not really into the Pilgrims' scene, but just doing his job; Leo Genn as William Bradford, intent on leading his followers to religious freedom; Gene Tierney as his wife, devoted to her husband but feeling stirrings for Jones. Van Johnson's on board too as ""Speak for Yourself John"" Alden. Sad ending actually a slight twist on real life fate of one of the principals. Perhaps a good starting point for a history lesson with the children on Thanksgiving Day.",997228800,20,808,4.820143884892087

4327877,4,B004CLYJF0,"Mr. Tracy has always been one of my favorite actors & I was truly thrilled when I first saw this film in adulthood. I'd no idea there were any Tracy films I'd not seen. I wasn't disappointed. They made Tracy a bit of a rogue, though Captain of the Mayflower, in this one,
But the Technicolor is ravishing as usual. A rather glossy attempt to portray the English party who landed at ""Plymouth Rock"" to start one of the 1st 'American' colonies, the story is entertaining, buoyed by the lovely Gene Tierney. Van Johnson a cooper and a carpenter, and Lloyd Bridges as Captain Tracy's first mate about the Mayflower add to the cast and crew but the ending kind of fades out a bit..",1441584000,,676,4.416

4327883,5,B004CLYJF0,"Here is a classic movie which is second to none in content to recount the historic landing of the ""Pilgrims"" on Plymouth Rock, in New England.  No movie due to time constraints can present every detail of this historic event nor avoid ""Hollywood"" compromises due to drama.  Nevertheless the Director, Clarence Thomas's genius in production portrays reality.  For example, a young boy succumbed to illness and he was buried at sea.  Some passengers were swept overboard while the ship sailed through storms.  In 1620, this group of religious outcasts rejected the King James Bible because of the Monarch's tyranny on his subjects.  Those outcasts dared to print their own Bible (Geneva Bible?).  The group, with their supplies - including a printing press, boarded the Mayflower for the voyage to the new world. They endured and survived hardships, storms, hunger and disease.  It was historical irony: During a storm, the main beam of the ship developed cracking fractures that could have caused the Mayflower to sink.  The printing press, which was intended to print Bibles in the new world, was used like a Jack-brace to hold the underneath of the main beam and was held together and saved the ship?!  However, no one stepped foot on dry land, until the Mayflower Compact was authored and everyone had signed allegiance to the document's contents.  The austerity of the Captain of the Mayflower was melted away as he witnessed the faith and courage of the pilgrims and stayed until their wilderness outpost was established.  The pilgrims established their outpost with the help of friendly Indians and dedicated it with Christianity, in the Name of Jesus Christ, including a printed Bible; the first location to be the beginning of what would become the United States of America.  This is not a clandestine propaganda film for promoting religion; objectively this historic-drama masterpiece recounts true events that happened in the past - and why we have the United States of America today.  An excellent family movie also.",1419638400,8,2026,5.081570996978852

4327899,5,B004CLYJF0,"First the musical score by Miklos Rosza is magnificent, and underlies most of the action. This one of his best if you like romanticism. Second Technicolor. We cannot see it in a digital copy, but the remaster is quite good. Third a cast headed by Spencer Tracy and six other Class A screen actors (in their time). I have howled wherever it looked promising to get even a VHS of this film. Finally maybe enough of us asked long enough so they have given us the best they can. I have never understood why this particular has been so constant overlooked. Perhaps it is the title, promising dark intolerable puritans, or the collapse of American interest in its own great history. In any event it is here, it is great, a good price can be found . . . and when you finish watching it, get the score. The whole score conducted by the composer.",1370131200,4,837,4.406451612903226

4327902,4,B004CLYJF0,"These movies which largely predominated starting in the 50's with the increase in tv,fewer motion pictures were made but those that were had larger budgets,special effects,the advent of the blockbuster and the great spectacle film! Like this movie which won an oscar for special effects,the story and drama is not that good. The failure is not the cast with the great acting talent(no one in american cinema can really compare at the tie with him)of spencer tracy van johnson and gene tierney this mgm production is good to view,for the special effects and the stars. Movies like this which are backward glances at history,often tell more of the world of 1952 than the past. The world of the time is one where the fears of the external world are internalized and structuralized. So we are back to the beginnings of the first settlers coming to america,many were outcasts the orphans,or those made so,and at the beginning of the film they are classed as those wanting to freely practice religion and those wanting to make money...but in all cases wanting to free themselves from external bonds. We meet the cynical captain. Its interesting to note how Tracy plays the captain to another well notes actor known for his cynicism humphrey bogart,and its interesting to note that bogart would say Tracy was a much better actor,but no one really would compare themselves to him. As this film shows...the cynic is one who has values infused in him,but finds little both in the place he left which abandoned this boat load of people, and also the people on the boat,and he repeats of the men bringing their women and children with them(and abandoning others wanting to escape). There are and this bogs down the story details about love interests,between the captain and the crew...but the main focus is on the new world...and how they want to create a perfect society...and there are people infused with great faith,careful in how they want to form government with full knowledge of their experience of the past. In a knowing comment one of the characters speak of forming a society based on that which dwells within them,the only basis they feel of bringing harmony to their new world...a new world created by the law writers themselves...and they create and sign the documents. Interesting view of the hopes and dreams of the religious pilgrims and their search for a new world...As the captain leaves they search his mind also,sift it,wondering if he too is trying to shake off his despair of human beings,looking for fellowship of some kind wanting to believe in something...and he welcomes all to take a return trip home? A 1952 look backwards at the dreamers of a new world,with the anxieties of the time detailing what that look backward would encompass and discuss...i wonder how they would make the same film today/  Tracy is great as always...look for other sea faring movies which are always looks at human nature Botany Bay,Mutiny on the bounty,Caine mutiny,Moby Dick,Titanic-both versions...",1333929600,,2996,4.956262425447316

It may have taken liberties with the facts, but the fact remains, this is the only film version that is widely seen. I remember watching it for the first time on an NBC network showing back in the early 70s but rarely saw it since, except for a couple of showings on the Disney Channel. I was glad to finally see this adventurous tale finally receive a DVD release and purchased it. I watch it every Thanksgiving season and am grateful. Spencer Tracy plays captain of the Mayflower, who seems bitter toward the Pilgrims but finally sees their worth by the end of the film. He solemnly promises to join them after one last voyage back to England. The bittersweet ending is that he never lived to see it happen, he died the year after his return to England.
