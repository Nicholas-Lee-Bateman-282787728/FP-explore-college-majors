2602058,2,B000G75AW0,"I was hoping that a plot line might save the obviously low-budget quality of this movie, but the plot was weak, far too coincidental, and just cheap all-together.  It's like somone wanted to make a movie about a threesome... so they could talk about it throughout the movie for a while.  Sorry--that cannot possibly be entertaining for two hours.  Granted, it did have it's funny moments, but it's definitely a guy-flick, since they paid more attention to how the actors looked than whether or not they can act.

I must admit, the ending was cute, but the movie consisted of far too many Kevin Smith movie references (Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) that were way too obvious.  If anything, this is a poorly put together homage to Kevin Smith's movies.",1167782400,5,759,4.71969696969697

quit before I even saw her. This is really a waste.",1464998400,,197,4.2105263157894735
8129291,4,B000G75AW0,the movie is ok nothing very rememberable there are some good laughs it is a ok movie just not great,1427932800,,100,4.05
8129292,1,B000G75AW0,"Im pretty sure this movie didn't need to be made at all. No depth, no production, no acting. Im pretty sure you can find anything better to do than spend 80 minutes watching Porkys with a pool guise.",1363305600,,199,4.2631578947368425
8129293,2,B000G75AW0,Wasnt all that good. Some scenes are ok but over all crap Being uncensored it was really crap do not get unless its under a buck,1355097600,,128,3.9615384615384617
8129294,5,B000G75AW0,"This is Indie Film at it's finest. Sure you may not think it's the ""funniest"" or the coolest, but if you look at it in a filmmaker point of view then it's pure genius, and inspiring. Shot with only $11,000 (and in 5 DAYS) this digital feature has a good and solid plot. Don't mind the Kevin Smith references, as K.S. was an inspiration (NOT a ""Rip off"") for Rocca to go out and make a film; we must all start somewhere. The cast is solid,funny, interesting (Hot) and keeps things interesting. Keep in mind this is an ""indie film"" and a fun one at that. Vincent Rocca has also showed that you don't need fancy effects and crazy scenes (and a LOT of MONEY) to have a GOOD movie, but rather, ""more is less"" type of indie feel. This was a really fun lndie Flick, that gives me hope in making MY own film. Check out the film, and aspire to make a film of your own. I know I will!",1326499200,4,874,4.087209302325581
8129295,1,B000G75AW0,"With this movie we cross from the realm of ""bad"" to intolerable.

To say this is awful makes it somehow seem salvageable; not so. Not even the extreme cuteness that is Nikki Stanzione can make this watchable, even in fast-forward. Not even Ginger Lynn, in an ill-advised cameo, can raise any interest in this at all.

Skip it...trust me on this. Not worth it even if you get it for free.",1255910400,,387,4.436619718309859
8129296,2,B000G75AW0,"I think this movie had a production budget of $1.98.  Maybe I over-stated it.  The movie was done as well as can be expected for what it is, but what it is, is short of expectations.",1198713600,,182,4.027777777777778
8129297,5,B000G75AW0,"Kisses & Caroms is a great, lite-hearted comedy that is simply fun to watch.  Hollywood could take a lesson from this.  Very entertaining without having a big name actor/actress.  The subject matter of the movie is the star.  Five stars !",1174262400,4,238,4.7317073170731705
8129298,1,B000G75AW0,"This is a very very boring movie. I thought I would give this movie a try but it was not worth it. The movie has no story line at all. Should be rated with ""no"" star !",1170720000,3,167,3.5405405405405403
