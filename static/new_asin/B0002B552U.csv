8109031,5,B0002B552U,It was great to recapture the old shows . You Bet Your Life was among my favorite.  Great family show.,1461801600,,102,4.1
8109032,5,B0002B552U,"What can you say about Groucho!  An amazing portfolio of some of his best shows from You Bet Your life, with special features that abound. MAny programs that appear here have not been seen in 50 years, because they were NOT part of the syndicated package, shown over and over again in reruns. Fun to see some of the original sponsors too.",1448928000,2,338,4.451612903225806
8109033,5,B0002B552U,"I purchased this dvd and found the quality to be quite good. A couple of episodes look a bit second generation VHS but still watchable. It's all about the dialogue. The episode description on the back cover has all the secret words incorrectly stated, which is strange. I have watched the episodes and found out which ones they are.
1/ February 18 1954 ""Clock""
2/ Unknown Date ""Hand"" (somewhere around 1954 I think)
3/ November 11 1954 ""Voice""
4/ December 16 1954 ""Wall""
5/ January 6 1955 ""Water""
6/ January 27 1955 ""Clock""
7/ April 7 1955 ""Voice""
8/ May 12 1955 ""Food""
9/ June 21 1956 ""Hand""
10/ Unknown Date ""Skin"" (Looks like 1960-1961 by the looks of the set and Groucho's age)
So if you don't have these episodes or some of them, This is the dvd for you. I can't understand why these dvd company's don't want people to know what's actually on the disc.",1435017600,,857,4.430379746835443

8109035,5,B0002B552U,"I have been searching for this video for years, as has my entire family.  The reason being, our mom was a very special guest on Groucho's show in the mid 50's.  My mom is still alive, and almost fainted when I sent her this DVD. Seeing her at 32 (she is now 88,) is hard to put into words.  I have always been a fan of Groucho and the Marx Brothers, and their brilliant comedy.  This DVD just brought it ""home"" for me.",1371859200,2,418,4.0
8109036,1,B0002B552U,"I wish the DVD producers would get organized and list the episodes by the date they originally aired, the secret word for each episode, and the names of the first two guests, on both the DVD covers and on Amazon and other sales web sites, so collectors of ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes can figure out which ones they have, and which ones they still need to buy,

Far too many 'YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" DVDs are just re-hashes of the same episodes that have appeared on other DVDs, and VHS tapes, repackaged with different artwork and names for the covers, some leaving out some episodes to cash in on the interest in ""YOU BET YOUR LIFE"" episodes by splitting them into multiple volumes from larger compilations.

Several hundred episodes were filmed and aired over a period of almost 14 years, and so it's frustrating to find the same relatively few episodes cropping up again and again on almost every DVD compilation.

From the lack of specific episode details, and not even an image of the DVD cover, it looks like this is another one of those re-hash collections, and thus isn't worth the effort to buy.

Until it's re-released with the above-mentioned specifics about all the episodes contained in it, this gets only one star in my book.

8109040,4,B0002B552U,"Just thought I'd pass on some information to the other people like me out there who are trying to collect the available episodes of this hilarious show with a minimum of duplicates.  I've listed the Secret Word and the first pair of guests for each of the 6 episodes included on this disc:

ROOM with Susan Miller and Bill Pearson

FOOT with Joe Egbert and Esther Bradley

SHOE with Charley Hymstra and daughter Rowena

MONEY with Lois Wright Bootson and Antonio Capazolo

HOUSE with Ginger & Don Drysdale

CHAIR with Kathleen Qualen and Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan

I admit I guessed on the spellings of some of the names.

None of these are on the ""Best Episodes"" collection released by Shout, and 4 are also on the 30 episode collection released by Allegro (ROOM and FOOT are not).  Happy hunting!",1273536000,5,793,4.640287769784172
