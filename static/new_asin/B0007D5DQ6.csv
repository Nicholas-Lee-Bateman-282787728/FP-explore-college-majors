2211102,4,B0007D5DQ6,"Definitely the best of the Samson and Delilah movies, despite its 1954 special effects which were probably the best studios could do during that era. Hedy Lamar was simply gorgeous and well-suited for the role of a real vixen!",1120435200,6,226,4.82051282051282
2211103,4,B0007D5DQ6,"Everyone is familiar with the Old Testament Bible story of the mighty Samson and the treacherous Delilah, and how the strongman was robbed of his powers once the biblical femme fatale sheared off his locks. This 1949 version is retold in splashy Cecil B. DeMille ( TEN COMMANDMENTS, KING OF KINGS ) style, with Technicolor that practically jumps off the screen and larger-than-life portrayals all around. The gorgeous Hedy Lamarr plays the vindictive Delilah to Victor Mature's Samson. Mature uses his expressive features to full advantage, melting hearts as the vulnerable Samson sans curls.

This import plays wonderfully, both sound and picture. If you like this movie and want it on DVD this may be your only chance to get it in the US.

8046991,2,B0007D5DQ6,"I've had the Paramount release of this epic for a couple of years now, and was rather disappointed at the pale colors and overall sort of blurry rendition.

When I was given a new imported release from the Boying company, it was everything the Paramount release should have been. Brilliant color, clear picture, and with bright white, good size subtitles, very easy to read.

It is a great pleasure for me to be able to enjoy this spectacular movie in all its spendor. I only wish it were wide screen (it is Full Screen), but I'm happy to be able to see it as it was made to be seen.",1171929600,3,583,4.290909090909091
8046992,3,B0007D5DQ6,Bought this movie from biblemovies.com and found that the sound quality was very poor and the color quality compared to a copied version on VHS was not up to par.  But when I purchased my new plasma HD TV and Sony PS3 system I loaded this DVD in and the results were outstanding. I found out that the PS3 can upconvert regular and even poor DVD quality to great color and sound. The image sharpness was not equal to a digitally remastered movie but the movie went back up on my best DVD movie collection. As long as it's played on PS3. I still want Paramount to give this movie an upgrade to the DVD format. I would buy it for what ever the price. I'm going online to Paramount.com and try to get an answer.,1168732800,5,707,4.198529411764706
8046993,1,B0007D5DQ6,"I was very disappointed when I opened up my newly received DVD of Samson and Delilah thinking that it would be in the rich beautiful color that the original movie was in.  Boy was I disappointed.  The color was very faint plus I was surprised to see that it has Chinese subtitles.  If I knew that it was made in China I would have never purchased the movie.  The quality if very poor and fuzzy.  I will never order another movie from this distributor again.  I feel this was a waste of my money.  I will now have to find another distributor who has a copy of this movie that I can buy that is not a Chinese copy, that is an American made copy and of better quality.  Buyers beware of this distributor.  I believe all their movies are Chinese quality.",1145664000,25,750,4.225352112676056
8046994,5,B0007D5DQ6,"This movie has always held a special place in my heart.  The biblical story of Samson and Delilah can be retold and even played by different actors, but never in my opinion better than that of Cecil B. Demille's remake of the old 1950s version. The film Starring: Victor Mature as the ""Mighty Samson"", and the ""Extremely gorgeous and vindictive"" Hedy Lamarr as Delilah is captivating from start to finish. The coloration of this version for its age is not the best, but its acting and beautiful filmed landscapes can never be replaced.",1128470400,7,535,4.752688172043011
8046995,1,B0007D5DQ6,Very poor color print of this film. Does not show off the original Technicolor photography well at all. Inferior print. Both sound and picture.,1127347200,32,143,5.0

8046997,5,B0007D5DQ6,"This glorious biblical epic by director Cecil B. DeMille with an enormous cast and the splendid production that adds to the spectacle of the story JUDGES: 13-16 was released in 1949. It won Academy Awards for Best Art Direction Color, and Best Costume Design that year. Unfortunatelly, ""This Studio"" that pioneered Biblical Spectacles is still not yet releasing a fully restored DVD of this movie, presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition that would show in all its grandeur this magnificent action adventure, so dear to all of us.

Hey Viacom/Paramount why do we have to buy bad import copies of this film on the internet, while Time/Warner finds it profitable to re-release ""BEN-HUR.""

Wake up guys we need this Biblical Classic fully restored and on the shops on DVD before 2006. Lets all films lovers vote here. So we let this studio due what is profitable to them and a thrill to us and history.",1121558400,114,947,4.839506172839506
