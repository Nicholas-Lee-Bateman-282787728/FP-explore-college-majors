6290369,5,B00IS02HA0,So much value in this set. Not only do you get all three oceans on blu ray with a extras disc but it also includes collectable dice with a deck of cards. You can't go wrong at this price and the movies look awesome. I have mine playing through a Sony blu ray player to a 7.1 surround sound reciever. Price to value I have to give this a solid 5 stars!,1401753600,,351,3.888888888888889
6290370,2,B00IS02HA0,"These films have been previously released on the blu-ray format, but the audio was DolbyDigital 5.1.  With this new release, many of us were hoping that theses films would be released in lossless, HD audio.  Sorry to say, but apparently Warner Bros.'s re-release has the same lossy audio as the first release.  The only thing new is the fourth disc with extras, a pair of dice, and a deck of cards.

Maybe next time?",1399593600,16,416,4.581081081081081
6290371,4,B00IS02HA0,While in no way a match for the original Ocean's 11 this George Clooney headed remake was entertaining.  Its sequal felt a little stiff but was a good movie.  The third film was a good watch also.,1502755200,,196,4.27027027027027
6290372,1,B00IS02HA0,The audio on the discs keeps cutting in and out. I have tried them on different players and it happens on all of them. Disappointing!,1500249600,,133,4.36

6290386,5,B00IS02HA0,Three good movies at a good price. Not all films are worth owning in a digital age. These films are timeless and usually crowd pleasers so they are worth having a copy of. Especially at this price.,1456963200,,197,4.351351351351352

6290393,5,B00IS02HA0,What a bargain! All 3 films for one good price! So fat the best one to me is still oceans 11 but 12 and 13 do deliver the same amount of gun and creativity as the first film did. Superstar cast!,1446076800,2,194,3.7560975609756095

6290400,5,B00IS02HA0,"Great series, been wanting to get all three for a while. Got the collection. Comes with a deck of cards and dice, but not the green dice from ""the Bank"" just red dice. ""Extras"" were nice, some behind the scenes and you get to relive all the great robbery capers again and again.",1424217600,2,278,4.264150943396227

6290405,5,B00IS02HA0,"This set looks so nice up on my shelf. I have not watched it yet, and if I'm perfectly honest with myself, it could be years before I get to it, but in the meantime it's occupying those five inches of shelf space with style and class. Boy howdy. Look at it up there.",1412553600,,266,3.9444444444444446

6290409,5,B00IS02HA0,"I don't know how many times I've watched Ocean's Eleven. My aunt and I watch it all the time, as it's her favorite movie as well. Ocean's Twelve is okay in my opinion. I know a lot of people don't like it but I enjoy it. Ocean's Thirteen is actually my least favorite but I'll still get through it. The dice that came with this package are really nice though I'm just going to leave them in their packaging. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.",1404345600,4,450,4.244186046511628
