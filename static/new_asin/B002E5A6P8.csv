8743737,4,B002E5A6P8,"While my daughter and son love the Zobey shows, I'm not thrilled. I love that Zobey encourages kids to eat better and be active, but the characters could use some work, for example, the ""explorer"" in this one, is a woman dressed as a man, with an odd voice that isn't quite male but not the females either.... why not just use a male actor or have the girl, be a girl? It could be really confusing to children in the tarfet age range the show is for. (Yes I said show, its only 30 mins on average for each. Zobey show) I have 3 other Zobey dvds, and because my kids do like them and they actually get up and move like Zobey tells them to and my son (who has always been a very picky eater) has actually started trying new fruits and veggies, I'll keep buying them. For that ill give it 4 stars, if the makers could get a bit more creative with the characters and make it a bit longer and it would be better.",1358380800,,907,4.044444444444444
