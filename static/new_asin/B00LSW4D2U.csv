THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS compresses LITTLE WOMEN into one holiday season, and while many of the book's plot elements are left out - ie: how Laurie (""Teddy"" here) first arrived to the neighborhood; how shy homebody Beth thawed the aloof Mr. Lawrence, or Beth's eventual fate - enough kernels remain that I can't slam it too much. In fact, I like the book so much I'm thankful for any screen adaptation.

This made-for-television film revolves around the March sisters' campaign to save their family home. The Orchard House is one of them sprawling Bostonian structures that require plenty of upkeep, except that the Marches can no longer afford the expenses, especially since Mr. March is ailing. Mrs. March devastates the girls with the news that Orchard House would have to be put up for sale. When the parents go on holiday so that Mr. March can recuperate, Jo (Julie Marie Berman), Meg (Kaitlin Doubleday), Beth (Melissa Farman), and Amy (Molly Kunz) embark on a massive home repair project. But even as the sisters try to cope with prodigious leaks and encroaching dry rot and bad wiring, they're diverted by sudden romantic complications.

THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS first aired in November of 2012 on Lifetime, and the holiday season is one of the few times you'll catch me watching this channel. I guess I can play it off and say that I tuned in so that I can pick up tips on home improvement. But I'd already confessed my fondness for LITTLE WOMEN. I will say that this Lifetime adaptation retains the book's lively spirit. As in the book, the focal point is Jo, whom Louisa May Alcott had modeled after herself. I really like how Julie Marie Berman interprets Jo, injecting her with an independent and stubborn, bossy and sometimes petty streak. Jo historically had always been an aspiring writer, and modern-day Jo is no different. She's a blogger as the movie begins. The other actresses are also fine, breathing life into the other March siblings. Side plots center on Meg's rekindling of an old romance, Beth's reluctance to spread her wings, and Amy's deep resentment at still being treated as the irresponsible youngest child.

Okay, we're treated to some familiar beats. Teddy Lawrence (Justin Bruening), the charming boy-next-door who is also Jo's best friend, nurses an unrequited crush on Jo. Even though younger and (disappointingly) more conventional than originally depicted, Professor Bhaer (Mark Famiglietti) does eventually make an entrance. And Amy, spoiled princess, as in the book, eventually stumbles onto unexpected romance, although she didn't have to go to Europe for it. Even though the interplay among the sisters are frequently tempestuous, was there any doubt that the Marches, when push comes to shove, will pull together? Even though the movie strays some (or quite a bit) from the original material, there's enough here for the book reader to make connections. Although a contemporary take, the film resurrects enough of the nostalgic charm and that benign chaos and that timeless sense of family that impressed on me when I first read LITTLE WOMEN, LITTLE MEN, and JO'S BOYS many years ago. As long as you don't expect this film to hew too closely to the book, this is a satisfying watch.

By the way, if you're thinking about buying this, please be aware that it's a Region-2 DVD.",1457827200,,3520,4.9308600337268125

It was a disgrace to Louisa May Alcott. It was nasty and it was inappropriate for a Christmas movie. Even if you don't know the original it's bad. JUST DON'T!!",1450051200,,328,4.39344262295082
