I don't know the actual story of Coromoto well enough to know the accuracy of the film, but I can say that there is nothing in this film that makes fun of the Catholic faith, on the contrary it is one of the few.  The acting is good.  Add it to your collection.  Buy it for a friend or for CCD presents.",1512864000,,431,4.035294117647059

8156312,2,B000KG4BDG,"This film has two storylines, one concerning the Virgin's appearances to Coromoto, leader of the Cospes Indians in Venezuela, and the other concerning her appearance to the daughter of the wealthy landowning family living nearby. The latter is a telenovela-style story in which a young woman in a wheelchair (having been knocked off her horse upon seeing the Virgin Mary) falls in love with a wealthy philanderer visiting from Spain. The Indian half of the story shows the Virgin Mary's attempts to convert the Cospes tribe. She appears before Coromoto several times, telling him to join the white people and be baptised, and although his family is persuaded, Coromoto himself resists. The film presents conversion to Christianity as a positive thing, glossing over the history of deception, slavery and slaughter that the Spaniards inflicted upon the Native Americans. I expected the movie to have a pro-Christian viewpoint, but I was hoping it wouldn't be as simplistic as this. The script and acting are uninspired and wooden. The cinematography, sets, and costumes are a little better, but still not good enough to save the film.",1323388800,,1133,5.163043478260869
8156313,5,B000KG4BDG,The movie was touching moving and inspirational. It shows you what faith can do and how it moves you. I highly recommend this movie.,1175731200,7,132,4.541666666666667
