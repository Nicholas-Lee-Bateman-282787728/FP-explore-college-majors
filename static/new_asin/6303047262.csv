558513,5,6303047262,"The principal difference between MEAN STREETS and FINGERS is that the focus in FINGERS is exclusively on the character played by Mr Keitel and his relationship with his father (mainly) and his mother, and his search for a partner who will give expression to his sexual longings.  The maintenance of tone throughout the film by Mr Toback is superb.  He also does not rush and cross cut scenes - he allows the inherent momentum of the scene to develop at the pace of the characters conversation, reactions and interactions.  The location shooting is vivid and relevant.  The sex and violence are also dramatically relevant and quite powerful, but the macho world may be offensive to a modern perspective where women are treated as compliant , and sometimes not so compliant, sex objects.  Just one memorable scene:  Jimmy informs his mother that his piano audition did not go so well.  His mother stares, squints, scrunches up her face and turns to the wall, utters no words but speaks  volumes.  In another scene his father tells him he should have been strangled at birth.  Jimmy takes out his rage in a number of ways.
Well worth owning.  Good Bach piano too.",1075766400,15,1160,4.778894472361809
558514,5,6303047262,"James Toback is quoted as telling Harvey Keitel in the Beverly Hills Hotel in 1977 that Keitel ""was born to do Fingers.""  Toback was right; Keitel delivers a first-rate performance that is arguably his best ever, alongside his work in Mean Streets and Bad Lieutenant.  This story is about mental anguish derived from perfectionism; Keitel tries to please his mobster father and his high-strung(describing his mother at best)pianist mother and fails, causing him to fall deeper and deeper into a brewing vat of psychosis.  He can find no love from his parents; to satisfy his hunger for love, he becomes fixated on a call girl named Carol (an excellent performance by Tisa Farrow)who he can never have. The rejection of him by his mother, the death of his father, and the loss of Carol combine to push Keitel's character, Jimmy Angelelli, over the edge.  Keitel is the father of method acting; his ability to apply the pain he has suffered in real-life situations to scenes in films strengthens the impact of the story once it is told.  It's important to remember that this man was praised by Jack Nicholson, a multiple Oscar Winner, as ""the best actor I've [Nicholson] ever worked with.""  This film bombed at the box office; it only played for a few weeks and prior to VHS proliferation in the mid 80s, only hard-core film buffs would have seen this.  The film was a failure primarily because Keitel was never taken seriously by Hollywood as a leading man.  Hollywood producers only ever saw the young Italian hood Charlie Cappa from Mean Streets when they saw Keitel.  If you like stories about tormented characters, Keitel provides an Oscar-caliber performance.  Of course, this clashes with Hollywood's view on Keitel, but let me leave you with the following truism: There is no such thing as meritocracy in acting; connections, not talent, make stars.  This is why Keitel's career was dead from the making of Fingers until his comeback in the early 90s with Bugsy, Bad Lieutenant, and Reservoir Dogs.",1042416000,7,2004,4.882005899705015
558515,4,6303047262,"Many  times over the years James Toback has been referred to as `brilliant', and a good deal of those times the film `Fingers' is mentioned in the same sentence.
It stands right there with Resevoir Dogs, Bad  Lieutenant, and Mean Streets-all Harvey Keitel films which have over the  years gotten far more applause  than they did earlier..
Actually the  premise is just enough unique: the concert pianist from the wrong side of  the tracks, the carefree and confused collector for his bookie  father.
Toback's dialogue is very raw, but it is on target for the very  raw world he describes.
Michael Gazzo gives one of his best performances  ever as Keitel's father.
Not to be missed, but if you look to Toback to  recreate this magic with his later efforts, `The Pick-Up Artist"" or  ""Exposed"", don't waste your time. Even his recent ""Two Girls and a Guy""  might have been ""Two Mil Down the Drain"" without the superb performance of  Robert Downey Jr.",949708800,9,947,4.736196319018405
558516,5,6303047262,"In all my years of movie viewing, there have been only two movies that I completely hated upon my first viewing: James Toback's FINGERS and David Lynch's BLUE VELVET.  To me, the former was a 90-minute exercise in  incompetence, with the director wallowing in material unfit for a sewer.  The latter was indescribable - an eclectic assortment of unrelated images  sewn together by momentary fits of brutal and sexual savagery.  I never  would have thought that my utter lack of understanding in film as a visual  language would soon come to pass, and ultimately permit me to enjoy further  viewings of these films which have become two of my all-time favorites.
FINGERS is one of the best movies you've more than likely never heard  of.  Though I found it to be initially revolting, I gave the film another  chance and boy am I glad I did.  Watching the film a second time revealed  one of the most audacious and best films made in the 1970's.  Harvey Keitel  gives what to me is his best film performance.  As Jimmy Angelleli (an  Angel in Hell - nice symbolism!), he's an aspiring concert pianist  moonlighting as a collector for his loan shark father, played wonderfully  by the late Michael V. Gazzo.  The predominantly New York City cast is made  up primarily of great character actors from THE GODFATHER films, in  particular Dominic Chianese (finally getting recognition on THE SOPRANOS)  and Lenny Montana.  Tony Sirico, who plays Pauly Walnuts on THE SOPRANOS,  is terrific as a gangster who has a nasty scuffle in a stairwell with  Keitel.  Danny Aiello and Ed Marinaro are great as Sirico's henchmen, and  Tanya Roberts(!) plays Sirico's girlfriend.  Marian Seldes is excellent in  her small role as Keitel's mother.  Tom Signorelli is great as a convict  sharing a cell with Keitel.  Jim Brown rounds out the cast as Dreems, and  Tisa Farrow plays his fey girlfriend.
Be warned, however - FINGERS is  not for everyone.  It is at times a brutal and depressing drama.  However,  you should give it a chance if you like MEAN STREETS and TAXI DRIVER, as  these are the films that come to mind while watching FINGERS.
The  film was shot by cinematographer Michael Chapman, a master of some great  1970's films like THE LAST DETAIL, TAXI DRIVER, and RAGING BULL.  His  camera mastery is brilliant here.  This, like THE FRENCH CONNECTION, is a  highly visceral New York movie.
James Toback deserves kudos for making  an uncompromising film.  For a directorial debut, it's a stunning  achievement, and it's the sort of film that would never get made today.  Superb.",949276800,26,2569,4.808755760368664
558517,5,6303047262,"The intensity and range of emotion projected by Harvey Keitel in this film are nothing short of incredible.

558634,5,6303047262,"A deliciously dark and fascinating character study.  James Toback has spewn  forth an iconic mob figure in  the dichotomous Jimmy Fingers who tenuously tiptoes the tightrope between culture and criminality.  His hands, and therefore his fingers, are vital to his diametrically opposed efforts as concert pianist and collector for his loan-sharking father.  But fingers figure elsewhere--frantically punching the elevator buttons, subduing his final foe in a vicious stairwell mano a mano, a sphincter-tightening prostate massage, and of course to push the PLAY button.  On a side note--check out Jim Brown in his skin tight 70s attire.  How would you like to tackle that when he has a 5 yard head of steam..  I say check this out.",1388102400,,730,5.17948717948718
558635,4,6303047262,"James Tovack's FINGERS is one helluva directing debut. In some aspects, it's reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAXI-DRIVER/dp/B000R8YC18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAXI DRIVER</a>. Both Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) in the former and Jimmy Fingers are troubled individuals. Travis is isolated, but Jimmy's the opposite, quite outgoing, if quirky. He travels the NYC streets with a Panasonic radio/cassette deck and enjoys playing oldies like the Chiffons' ""One Fine Day."" Jimmy also has what's called today a sex addiction, he's constantly on the hunt and trying to score, but there's one gal Jimmy truly loves. That affection goes unrequited.

Carol (Tisa Farrow), Jimmy's obssession, is a call girl whose pimp is a musclebound ex-boxer named Dreems (Jim Brown). That Jimmy can't get Carol to be exclusively his is causing him pain, and there's a scene where Dreems invites him to a private two-couple party with Carol and another hooker. It's an opportunity squandered, as Jimmy is unable to perform with Dreems and the other woman present. Totally embarrassing, and there's two other things that are really screwing up his life.

Jimmy tries to lead a double existence. He's half-Italian Catholic, half-Jewish. His mom was a concert pianist, and Jimmy aspires to do the same. His playing style is eccentric, for he mouths every note, yet that showy quality is not necessarily a bad thing for a classical musician. The biggest obstacle is Jimmy can only play flawlessly when he's alone. Not good for someone wanting to perform in concert.

Then there's Ben, his father (Michael V. Gazzo), a small-time mobster who no longer has any ""collectors"" except for Jimmy. Ben often browbeats him to get Jimmy to hammer some deadbeat for repayment. Although reluctant to do so, Jimmy's good at strongarming, for he's got a violent temper.

Lenny Montana (Luca Brasi in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-GODFATHER/dp/B0001NBNB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE GODFATHER</a>) is here a pizzeria owner who's stiffed Ben for 4K. An encounter at his place of business shows just how shortfused Jimmy is.

Be advised there's a few sequences of slam-bam sex, arguably necessary to the story, the rauchiest occurring in a ladies locker room with Jimmy and the smokin' hot bikini-clad girlfriend of a guy who owes Ben 22K.

The similarity to TAXI DRIVER is that rejection of someone dear to them contributes to these men snapping. Some goriness results, but in Jimmy's case, the main trigger is something more important to him than a girlfriend. Where they really differ is, at the end these two characters are in very different places mentally.",1374969600,2,2729,5.579710144927536
558636,5,6303047262,This was an old 70's era gangster and pimp flick that was well acted. It brought back fond memories of that era!,1358640000,,112,4.136363636363637
558637,5,6303047262,"Like another reviewer, it took a second viewing of this movie---in the latter instance, listening to the director's commentary---to really put the hook into me.

I was floored the second time around (and nearly tossed the DVD into the trash after the first fifteen minutes of the first viewing).

This movie is way, way ahead of its time, on so many levels.  It's really not a movie about a specific time or location, or really, event a particular plot.  It's about the increasing lack of commitment or intimacy in our society, and how, in our emotional immaturity, we seek doomed avenues.

(*spoiler alert*)

What helps the viewer understand the basic theme of the movie is the fact that, eventually, we realize that the main character, Jimmy, is not in fact a pianist; or rather, he is not a good one, and lives with dellusional aspirations because, well, we all expect it of ourselves (by the director's own admission, he would have made it obvious from the beginning that Jimmy is not actually playing the piano as the stereo tapes appear to be recording his practices; Jimmy is merely pretending to play the piano to pre-recorded music).  But his dellusions of a musical career are so deep-seeded such that he pretends to flub an audition, rather than admit to himself that he was never even remotely good enough to have auditioned in the first place.

How many people have we all known like that?  Ninety percent of young people in college live exactly those kinds of lies, because our alpha-male society demands it of them.",1343692800,,1530,4.765151515151516
558638,2,6303047262,"FINGERS (1977) is not a traditional horror movie, as in the genre,
but in the reaction that is imparted to the audience, as the action
unfolds over 90 minutes, with Keitel trying to pull himself out of
his station in life, as a collector of illegal debts that went bad
despite showing an innate talent in collections.

He tries to make the leap forward to a professional pianist, hoping
to perform at the famous Carnegie Hall one day. Unfortunately, the
character finds out there's a lot of hard work, practice in addition
to  the necessary talent (something already taken for granted)  and
competition  to beat before attaining that special status.

The lesson of this movie, is the danger of embracing the darkness,
losing one's humanity, and vulnerability when violent, horrible deeds
are done, that take the yin and the yang out of balance. We see
Keitel's character weep, as he attends an after hours party, and the
owner expects Keitel and several ladies to perform sexually in the
presence of others, without privacy, or doing a menage a
trois. Keitel's role, shies away for various reasons, if not only
from the shame, as do the ladies as well.

Here, Keitel reprises his role, of someone who puts on his ""diving
suit"" and goes into the depths of estrangement, cruelty, dispair
violence, as a result of employing extreme ""business tactics""
expected to in certain mob circles to avoid being
ridiculed,  exploited, or run out of business, involving collection
debts of gambling, business loans, protection fees, etc

The merit of this picture, is the simplicity of the dialog, and often
the superb cinematographic quality of the wide-screen picture,
bursting with color, sharpness, vividness, showing an extremely
""live"" feeling to the action, even 30 years later, amazingly. The
aging of the movie, is not perceived so easily, except for the dated
automobiles, and lack of cleanliness of the  streets.

There are, of course, the token ""eye candy"" young ladies, played by
Tisa Farrow, and Tanya Roberts, shown at a swimming pool, relaxing,
giving Keitel an opportunity to change gears.

The protagonist, focused on his aspiring career as a pianist, is
estranged partly for that reason, and acts bizarrely, by carrying a
portable mini-cassette player with him to greasy spoons, public
parks, and more to listen to FM Radio and his own 50's and 60's hit
songs. We see Keitel tell an officer ""You shouldn't be wasting your
time with this law enforcement nonsense!""

The sterotypical image of mobsters, justifiable or not, of people who
use hard language is amply demonstrated in this picture, which has
Keitel using dozens of phrases, words, straight from the gutter, or
even, simplistic, neanderthal ways of conveying human needs, desires.

This tough language is used between people, friends or foe, and will
shock people, from its graphic nature. The audience, will either
cringe, or mock it or both. Perhaps the ultimate cruelty, is Keitel
refusing to take out a debtor who is not cooperating, and being told
by his father "" I should have strangled you in your crib!""

There is a complicated, challenging, difficult scene at the end,
involving ball squeezing, eyesocket punching, and similar, showing
below the belt tactics, further underlining the underground aspect of
this picture.

Overall, this picture is professional, extraordinarily lush, colorful
film with sharp images great for theatres, to scare the audience, in
a nightmare lasting 90 mins, when a man's morality is at stake, the
soul is up for grabs.",1180915200,2,3521,5.05699481865285
558639,3,6303047262,"Director James Toback are to interracial relationships what Oliver Stone is to Vietnam.  In this early effort, sponsored no less by Brut cologne, Harvey Keitel rehearses his lifelong cycle of variations as the bad lieutenant by playing this round, a bad Glenn Gould.  The translucent Tisa Farrow (Mia's better half) personifies the complex seventies New York female artist, while Keitel, armed with Gouldish chattering teeth, begins his battle against on the cinematic motif of the piano, chosing this round, to attack Bach's Toccata BWV 914 (ironically, one of Glenn Gould's least favorite Bach piece).

The moment of high comedy arrives when Jimmy Fingers attempts to tame the beast within holding cell prisoners with an a capella rendition of the Allegro Fuga on the E Minor Toccata.  One can't help but breath a sigh of relief that Toback didn't pick Schubert's Impromptu No. 2 in E Flat Major.  There's no telling what kind of sonic time space vortex Kietel would have unleashed in that instance.

Watch it nostalgically for the seventies swagger, the PlayLand-ladened Manhattan Streets and the cobblestones of Soho, and love it for the portable radio carrying pre-Walkman strut.  Toback, is in top form juggling class, race, and taste between New York City characters that one would often see back in the day.

One almost expects scarfed-muzzled Gould to jump out at every intersection to give Jimmy Fingers a beating within an inch of his life with that big Canadian vocabulary.",1168300800,,1485,5.107438016528926
558640,4,6303047262,"""Fingers"" is solid 1970s character study starring Harvey Keitel as conflicted man struggling to unite his disparate persona.  On one hand, he's a talented musician who loves to listen to Bach and carries a boombox around so that he can listen to 60s R&B.  However, he's also a violent thug who does his even more brutal father's bidding.  The movie follows his character over a few days as he attempts to resolve who he is and what he stands for in life.  It's a short, dark film that's very good to great in nearly every aspect.

The movie represents Harvey Keitel's first leading role, and he`s terrific, even riveting at times.  Michael V. Gazzo (""The Godfather Part 2) is perhaps even better as Keitel's crude, Jerry Vale-loving father; he nearly screams every line he has, yet manages to avoid being a caricature.  The supporting cast is filled with actors who would go on to greater fame, including Danny Aiello, Ed Marinaro, and Tony Sirico (Paulie on ""The Sopranos"").  Director/screenwriter James Toback was a virtual unknown at the time, having written only ""The Gambler"" (starring James Caan).  Nevertheless, the script is nearly brilliant - full of small, vivid details and texture, although it's not always as cohesive as one might wish (resulting in the 4-star rating).  His directing is confident, particularly given the amazingly zippy 19 day shooting time!

Lovers of 70s indie cinema will likely find many things to appreciate in ""Fingers.""  A few other reviewers here compared the movie to ""Mean Streets,"" and I agree that it's a fairly apt comparison, as both essentially focus on characters' attempts to reconcile their violence with their morality.  However, this film is no mere Scorsese copycat and stands on its own just fine.  Surprisingly, ""Fingers"" was remade in 2005 as a French film, called ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped.""  I can't wait to check out that version.

Extras: Original theatrical trailer; a short conversation with Keitel and Toback about making indie films; director's audio commentary.  Toback's commentary is excellent, and he discusses the thinly veiled homoeroticism of the main character - a definite must-listen.",1159574400,,2163,5.0821529745042495
558641,1,6303047262,"This is a movie that seems abstract though it isn't.

It follows the main character who is a talented pianist and also has a lot of connection to the crime world.  He also has a prostitute love interest.

It doesn't do much to examine the relationships between these 3 aspects of his life.  It pretty much shows him being a bumbling loser in all 3 of the aspects pretty much separately.

I didn't feel much direction to his motivations or point of the story.  To me, it felt as watching uninteresting random moments in this guys life and just never finding a reason why or why to care.

The dvd does has a commentary track with the writer/director and you do get to see the psychology of what he is trying to portray.

But since psychology is not in anyway a science but a collection of opinion posing as science, analyzation of the meaning of this type of film is impossible without the commentary and therefore will seem random to most people.  And for those who will apply meaning, will likely differ greatly as originally intended.

As such it is similar to Taxi Driver.  However Taxi Driver was much broader and more general that more people would attach significance to it.  Fingers is far more narrow and detailed as the directors very intricate explanations in the commentary demonstrate.  Thus, a smaller audience will identify with it.

Personally, the actions of this character did not connect with any personal motivations and just seemed random.",1148342400,2,1458,4.711462450592886
