1711567,4,B00006675S,"I grew up watching the Wonderful World of Disney weekly broadcasts on network tv as a kid, so I've probably seen Biscuit Eater at some point long ago though I have no memory of it.  I recently decided to rent it for my 6 year old son, and what a treat it is!  Biscuit Eater tells the story of two young boys, Text and Lonnie (one African American and one Caucasian), and their adventure training a seemingly un-trainable bird dog.  Lonnie's father trains dogs professionally but has given up on the one they call biscuit eater, so he unloads the dog on local store owner Willie Dorsey (played with great humor and gusto by Godfrey Cambridge).  Lonnie and his friend Text hatch a scheme to get the dog back, and after doing so they discover that he is actually a diamond-in-the-rough champion bird dog that just needs the right kind of training.  They boys end up competing in a local bird dog competition with a good chance of winning, but due to unforeseen circumstances they are forced to choose between victory and family loyalty.
The Biscuit Eater harkens back to a gentler era of film-making and I'm sure some will accuse it of being boring (though I would totally disagree).  It is gently paced and relies heavily on story, plot, and character relationships unlike many modern kids' movies.  There are wonderful themes of racial unity, family loyalty, and community solidarity along the way and the idyllic rural life setting is wholesome and endearing.  This movie is nothing like most modern children's movies that rely on heavy doses of slapstick, sarcasm, hyper paced editing, and adolescent pretension.  I loved this one, and more importantly so did my 6 year old son.  If you're looking for something for the kids that isn't just entertaining but is also uplifting, you'll do well by the Biscuit Eater.",1303862400,,1814,4.766773162939297
1711568,5,B00006675S,"Ok. I'll admit this is theoretically about a dog. But you don't find many movies with this genuine depth, let alone one that's fun and suitable for all ages.

1972 Disney movie, set in the 1920's. A bird dog field trial trainer comes up with a dog he can't do a thing with, a total washout whose father was a sheepkiller. But the trainer's young 12-year-old son and his best friend buy back the dog after he is given away and work with him. They believe in him and he in them. And then comes the Big Trial and some serious moral decisions to be made by the boys..and later,one to be made by the mother and father.

This is old style trialing (for we trialers). Handlers wear coats and ties, walking older style pointing, handlers shoot their own birds, dogs retrieve. But the 1920's
style of the trials doesn't take away from the really excellent movie.

Much more than just ""a dog movie"". The father has to learn about being a dad, the boys have to learn something about being men and the mother something important about being a wife and woman. Great humor from a young Godfrey Cambridge,and great characters throughout. And of course, ""Moreover"" the German Wirehaired Pointer.

If you haven't seen it, you should. You won't forget ""Biscuit Eater"". My wirehair gave it to me for my birthday. And it is, by the way, a good quality DVD.",1280448000,,1336,4.508264462809917

1711570,3,B00006675S,"This movie was okay. The cover of the movie is very misleading, because it's about another dog. Some kids train a dog they call Moreover to be a bird-dog. They enter in a contest. Will they win? You gotta check out THE BISCUIT EATER!!!",1238630400,,235,4.363636363636363
1711571,5,B00006675S,"What a wonderful story this is about two boys and a hunting dog[Wire Haired Pointing Griffon]. The adults get no where with his training but he responds to the children as it should be. I saw this movie many moons ago and declared I wanted this wirey brown haired dog.  Just recently I found what the breed was and purchsed one and to my absolute amazement the dog reacts as the movie portrayed him, right down to eating eggs.  It's a very moralistic movie for kids and a lot of laughs and a lot of fun to watch.",1174089600,9,512,4.214285714285714
1711572,1,B00006675S,"I actually ordered this DVD not aware it was only a remake of the 1940 movie in black and white that was a lasting memory I had as a young child. In trying to rekindle those memories,I watched about twenty minutes of this version before turning it off. Because the original had left such an indelible memory, I didn't need to see anymore to know I made a mistake in getting this one. The original starred Billy Lee and Cordell Hickman as the two young boys and I believe it may have even been voted the best piture of 1940. Easily worthy of five stars. This version may still appeal to other people but if they were to see the original I'm sure they'd agree as there's no comparison.",1159574400,11,683,4.3023255813953485
1711573,5,B00006675S,"I  saw this  movie a long time  back, and its  very sad

and regardless of amazon.com  review, this is an excellent

movie of a love between a boy and a dog.

We all had a best friend at one time or another aka  a  dog.

The era of this movie was a slow time in  america and

its a movie  to sit back and  relax and feel yourself right there.

Very enjoyable and a tear  jerker",1113782400,10,377,3.75
1711574,5,B00006675S,"In my opinion, this is Disney's best Dog film and my personal favorite of all Disney films.  Based on a short story of the same title, Disney edits the film version to make it more fun for children, primarily by letting the dog live in the end of the film adaptation.
The Biscuit eater is a story of two boys, one black and one white, who jointly own and train the protagonist-a bird dog-with the hope of running it in the Grand National Field Trials at the Ames Plantation.  Overcoming many obstacles, the dog and the boys persevere and learn valuable lessons along the way.  There are beautiful images of the dogs pointing bobwhite quail and the subsequent covey rises.
The Biscuit Eater is also a story from the ""Old Disney."" Hence, critics who lament the direction the company has gone in recent years will love this older film digitally mastered on DVD.",1072656000,8,858,4.594771241830065

1711606,2,B00006675S,"I'm so surprised at the number of people who gave this movie four stars. One of the reasons for my disappointment is that I asked my elderly mother what her favorite all-time movie was, and she said The Biscuit Eater. To surprise her, I went online and bought the DVD! Unfortunately when we sat down for a film night, with the two of us plus her granddaughter (my niece), she immediately said, this isn't the Biscuit Eater... and it was not the original she had loved. But we cheerfully sat through it laughing at how corny and unbelievable it was. Even my 12 year-old niece commented on how ""Disney"" it was and why does everyone over-explain themselves.  The movie starts out with people calling the dog a biscuit eater for no apparent reason (except to tie it back into the name of the original film which it has nothing to do with.) There is more focus on the dog being an egg sucker. So many things don't tie together. It's just bizarre! As one commenter noted, the original film is considered a classic and ""not to be missed."" It is sold on a classic movie site and I have since ordered it.",1442620800,,1095,4.420792079207921
