8392047,1,B0039BOYEK,"First of all this DVD contains ""Forced Subtitles"" meaning the subtitles CANNOT be turned off! Most people who would buy this DVD (probably mostly men) buy it to look at Shannon Whirry's beautiful nude body. Unfortunately, the subtitles are constantly in the way of her breasts! I wish that they would tell you that the subtitles cannot be turned off in the product description. Had I known that I would not have bought this DVD! The second thing is that there is no ""Interactive Menu"" as described on this DVD. In fact, there is no menu at all. There are 4 or 5 trailers and then the film just starts. No chapter or scene index, NOTHING! Since there were no customer reviews for me to read, I did not know any of this. I have been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for a long time and I ended up being greatly disappointed! I hope this helps others. Thanks.",1317168000,13,864,4.339506172839506
