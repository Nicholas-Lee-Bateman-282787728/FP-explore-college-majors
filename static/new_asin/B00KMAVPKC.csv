8659989,4,B00KMAVPKC,R.I.P. Wes Craven. This was a good movie. Intense and exciting. I think some viewers think this was a lifetime movie. It may look like it. But it's not. I think it's one of his finest work.,1528934400,,189,4.135135135135135
8659990,2,B00KMAVPKC,"Mark (Billy Burke) takes his wife Carla (Megan Ward ) to a remote look out to photograph her. Carla's sister Rachel (Tara Spencer-Nairn) tags along and ends up at the bottom of the cliff....watch that first step. Carla develops severe acrophobia and joins a special group that forces people to face their fears. Members in the group start to die and it appears Rachel's ghost may be responsible.

This was a made for TV film with the thrill and suspense of a Lifetime adventure. It was certainly more drama than horror and even with the Hitchcock twist, I was still board. Too long for too little. We see little of the action.",1503532800,,626,4.589285714285714
8659991,3,B00KMAVPKC,"Good for a change of pace if you're interested in psychological thrillers. Its not a horror film and no bloody scenes and Zippo bad language. The characters are wooden showing virtual no feeling or remorse. The only one who did was Rachel and she was killed early in the beginning. Sisters Carla and Rachel go up with Mark,Carla's husband to take photographs of them. Rachel leans against a fence and it breaks...Carla goes to help her but loses her grip and she falls. She seeks help in a therapy group to cure her fear of heights. She has bad dreams of her sister haunting her etc...Meanwhile back at the ranch a killer is picking off her group people one by one. This movie is ok..not great. It chugs along like a great pitcher duel between the Yankees and Red Sox game. The ending was a head scratcher as the motive is revealed....Don't expect a typical Wes Craven movie...Clearly he would of made a different movie altogether.....Running Time:90 Rated: NR Adult situations,violence.(where?)",1442188800,,995,4.824561403508772
