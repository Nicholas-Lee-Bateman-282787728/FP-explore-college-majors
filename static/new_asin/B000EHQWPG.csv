8110340,5,B000EHQWPG,"This is just a great straight out comedy. By that I mean it did not rely upon raunchy or crude behavior to be comical, just a good storyline, acting, and directing. I have watched a few L D S movies lately and have to say that by far this was one of the best.",1480809600,,259,3.814814814814815

8110345,3,B000EHQWPG,"This is a made-for-video movie about the doings of two lovable rascals, brothers from Texas, who come a-wooing, under false pretenses, to the L.D.S. Mormon-land of Idaho (just to the north of Utah and, in many ways, almost as L.D.S. Mormon as Utah itself, Idaho being, as many will recall, the Mormon cultural homeland of of one of the two male gay lovers whose plight ""Latter Days"" cinematically recounts, partly in Idaho settings). The movie will appeal to a limited audience in the morally jaded film-consuming landscape of the contemporary U. S. of A., but for those seeking ""family fare"", this makes good viewing around the familial video-playing T.V. set.

The two rather average-looking but rather rugged ""Romeos of the West"" have come to find a girl whose picture, posing in a family photo, the lads have seen and with whom one of the brothers tumbles hopelessly in love just from that photographic clue. To gain access to the Idaho girl's home, they pose as exchange students from Eastern Europe whose arrival the family of the girl is expecting. The boys are sufficiently bewildered at the Mormon culture of the town, the family, and of other folks in the Idaho community, a lot different from what they have known in Texas, so the two amourous brothers are able to convey an impression of bewilderment that everyone expects of foreign exchange students. The brother of the twain who is not already ""hooked on"" a particular girl even before arrival in Idaho, plays off the affection of two young women whom he encounters in the town, and that begins to make things confusing, eventually resulting in ""blowing their cover"". Complications ensue. However, love overcomes all and two pairs of lovers emerge from the confusion, adding two youthful males to Idaho's population. (They do not intend now to return to Texas.)

The film obviously was made for and by L.D.S. Mormons, mostly, one assumes, for their own kind. That said, while the ethos and much of the detail clearly betoken a L.D.S. Mormon culture, there are some details that seem surprising to this viewer, whose mother, and all of the relatives on her side of the family, come from an Utah family. The local ward-house looks resembles a Protestant Christian facility more than it does the Mormon meeting houses that I recall from my childhood, way back in the early 1950s. The presence of a cross in the chancel, for example, is not (or, at any rate, was not then) typical of Mormon ecclesiastical architecture. I almost begain to wonder if that house of worship was of the ""Community of Christ"" (R.L.D.S. Mormon) rather than L.D.S. I suppose that this visual bit of confusion may simply be there to cater to more usual Christian sensibilities and expectations, for the sake of appeal to non-Mormons (i.e., non-L.D.S.) among viewers.

The movie is, obviously, low-budget but not downright cheap. The acting, while hardly extraordinary, is passable, with the exception of cast member Robert Swenson (playing ""Doogie""), whose bizarre motions and body language would seem to betoken odd expectations on his part of what an actor ought to do on set and on screen. Well, the cast, like the movie itself, is moderate in quality, but appealing enough to make seeing ""Take a Chance"" worth it for viewers who do not insist upon rampant licentiousness, on loose language, and upon seeing bedded-down or rug-rolling couples thrashing naked in the throes of fornication (and, admittedly, that sort of thing can be quite a lot of fun to watch!), as suitable fare to arouse their pleasure in a 20s-something double romance. One can take a chance on ""Take a Chance"" without undue disappointment.",1390348800,,3649,4.930081300813008
8110346,5,B000EHQWPG,"This movie is just too funny.  I live in Alaska where the winter's are long and I can't work anymore due to health problems.  When I get really depressed I pop in a Mormon flick like this and start laughing.  I especially love their ""accents"".  And what young men will do to get the girl of their heart!  Funny!",1325635200,2,311,4.203389830508475
8110347,5,B000EHQWPG,"I think my son clued me into this one.  We watched it as a family and I laughed until the tears started.  It is a goofy show about taking a chance to find romance.  We later invited some close friends to watch it with us and got the same response.  In fact it was even funnier to watch my buddy laugh until he could scarcely breathe.  The two boys are brothers from Texas.  Their Dad has an accident hitting two boys on their bikes.  While they are healing at the house, they are all just sitting around chatting and one of the boys shows a picture of his family so every one can see.  Elliot, the one in the gray tee, looks at the picture and falls head over heals for this guys sister.  He figures out a plan to meet her, so he and his brother go to Idaho to meet her.  The plan is quite unique, they pretend to be the family's exchange students from Hungary, and it gets very funny from there on.  They eventually get figured out but the ending is good.  I love this one!",1297900800,2,974,4.068421052631579
8110348,2,B000EHQWPG,"I ""took a chance"" on this movie.  If you watch it maybe you too can build a relationship based on lies and deceit.",1289779200,,114,3.9565217391304346
8110349,5,B000EHQWPG,"""Take a Chance"" has an amusing and appealing storyline--2 country brothers rescue a traveling salesperson who shows them a picture of his sister.  One of the brothers feels she is his soulmate and the two brothers travel across country to find his true love.  Not exactly planning this adventure out, they pose as the family's 2 Russian exchange students that had actually cancelled their trip.  Heyborne and Allred do an outstanding job, switching to and from their bumpkin accents to Russian.
While not exactly Oscar material, it IS a well-done, tender, humorous, touching and all around good family comedy.  You don't often find comedies that aren't nasty and raunchy these days--if that's the genre you're looking for--this absolutely fits the bill!",1181865600,14,753,5.198347107438017
