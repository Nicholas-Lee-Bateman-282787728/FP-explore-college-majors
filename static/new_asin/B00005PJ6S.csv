1642233,5,B00005PJ6S,"Screw the bad reviews this animation movie is the best animated movie ever, it's rudely hilarious, move over Homer Simpson, Eric Cartman or even Beavis & Butt-head, this is a true animated classic, I haven't see the originally one yet, but I think it's going to be great as well, even the simpsons had a spoof of these films from the Itchy & Scratchy show.  This movie deep-down puts everything down, especially, Hitler, The Space Station first landing of th moon, and it basically shows how everything was in the early 70's, Fritz smokes pots to get away from his overbearing big-breasted old-women.  Fritz gets kill in every life and vision. The most weirdest part is that Satan being gay! Fritz sleeps with any girl he says, what do expect, he has no pants on!
This movie the best, if anyone want to experience is the late 60's and the early 70's,watch this unique film, simply the raunchiest comedy ever!",1037404800,9,908,4.66875
1642234,1,B00005PJ6S,"Ok, I thought it would be cool, but it's not. Some parts of it spark my interest, but not enough. Basically, it has no plot. From the whole 30 minutes I whatched it (I couldn't stand any more)I realized this movie was made by a man, for men. I'm not the type of gal who enjoys seeing cartoon creatures having three somes and female animals jumping around naked. Just not my cup of tea. Too bad I bought both of the Fritz ... The Cat movies. It's straight out degrading. Of course, like most movies, they don't full frontal of men bouncing around butt naked. If I could, I would give it zero stars",1031356800,7,596,4.2368421052631575
1642235,2,B00005PJ6S,"I really just could not enjoy this one..and I really wanted to having enjoyed the first film so much. First it's alot more tame than the original , and by today's standards it's very tame. And it's just plain boring. The first one may have dragged in certain spots but it still kept you entertained , this one just drags and drags , and is just boring as Fritz sits around on welfare , smokes pot , ignores his nagging wife , and daydreams some rediculous situations that aren't entertaining or raunchy. Skip it",1017100800,3,511,4.446808510638298
1642236,2,B00005PJ6S,"This is a poor sequel to a great cartoon (Fritz The Cat). I didn't enjoy it when released and like it even less now.

1642256,3,B00005PJ6S,"In 1959 a young Robert Crumb first created the character-Fritz the Cat. In 1972 Ralph Bakshi brought the character to the big screen in perhaps my favorite movie of all time. In 1974 Robert Taylor directed this sequel. Crumb admittedly wasn't a fan of Bakshi's film, however in the case of its sequel, to Crumb it doesn't exist. I first saw the Nine Lives when I was 17 and saw its predecessor when I was 16. In between both I read the comics. Now I can easily say that I love Crumb's comics and the first movie. However with Nine Lives, its hard to say.

PLOT: Fritz now lives on welfare with a wife and kid. He smokes pot and sits around while his 'old lady' yells at him. He then imagines what life would be like if things were different. What follows is a series of segments or shorts of Fritz's thoughts. Segment 1 Fritz talks to some guy and then gets high with his sister. Segment 2 Fritz talks to a bum who thinks he's God. Segment 3 Fritz is a soldier during WWII and he chats with Hitler. Segment 4 Fritz jokes around and angers a hippo. Segment 5 Fritz dances in front of an orchestra. Segment 6 Fritz goes to cash his welfare check and sells a toilet. Segment 7 Fritz goes into space. Segment 8 Fritz talks to Duke's ghost. Segment 9 Fritz goes to New Jersey. Segment 10 Fritz is in the sewer and has a funny encounter with Satan.

THOUGHTS: Nines Lives is all over the place and really bogs up and down. Segments go on for far longer than necessary or fail to keep the viewer's interest. While it has some good moments and even moments of pure genius, it's a terrible presentation of the character and really could've been better.

REVIEW: Oh boy, wow um. First off Nine Lives is convoluted and the general plot really makes no sense. Like I said the film has its moments, allow me to go into more detail... The main story isn't interesting but fairly funny. The first segment also has a couple funny moments but really goes no where. The second segment is overall pretty humorous but goes no where and drags a bit. The 3rd segment has moments of hilarity but again doesn't go anywhere. Segment 4 is a little funny but never amounts to anything either. Segment 5 has some good music but goes on for far too long and is extremely dull. Segments 6 and 7, click together and while segment 6 is amusing, 7 is not. Segment 8 segues into 9 but also goes nowhere and fails to recapture Duke's character. Segment 9 is actually good, amusing, funny and goes some where. It's the only segment with any depth. Segment 10 is hilarious but has no real purpose. The ending is funny though. All in all Nine Lives is lacking and while it is amusing at times, really needed a better director.

FINAL THOUGHTS: Nine Lives is more of a collector's item and for completists only. It's not too bad but not that interesting. Others who are curious should only see the New Africa/New Jersey segment and the sewer segment. When compared to the comics and its predecessor, Nine Lives pales in comparison.

1642281,1,B00005PJ6S,"I don't mind controversial content, as long as it has a strong plot, not strong pot! It's like they're trying to cram all possible shock humor and other adult-oriented content into one movie to get their frustrations of having to do stupid sugar-coated kids shows for so long out of their systems. Usually that sort of story treatment can be found in horrible lemony fan fiction inspired by sexually frustrated teens. It leaves you wondering 'Why did I waste my time?'

1642345,3,B00005PJ6S,"After the success of the first film in 1972, 1974 saw the release of The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat. Unlike the first film, written and directed by Ralph Bakshi, this was written by Fred Halliday, Eric Monte, and Robert Taylor, as well as being directed by the latter.

The film is told in a series of short vignettes, each detailing a misadventure in the life of Fritz the Cat.

Skip Hinnant returns to voice the feline, now unhappily married and living on welfare in the 1970s. The movie opens with Fritz being berated by his wife. So, being a responsible husband, Fritz lights a joint and drifts away into a series of irreverent misadventures, beginning with him seducing a young ""girl."" Later, he meets God in the form of a homeless wino. Then, he becomes a member of the Nazi party, where he meets Adolph Hitler (represented by a dog). Finally, Fritz finds himself in the middle of a political assassination plot, before meeting an Indian guru in the city sewer, and lastly, meeting Satan (allowing the filmmakers the opportunity to add homosexual stereotypes to their repertoire).

Also in the film is one very long, drawn out, dull 1940s sequence that runs about six minutes and could've been cut out of the film without affecting anything.

Still, the sequel goes more for entertainment than the first film did and some moments in this film are much funnier than anything in the first movie.

The sequel avoids much of the social commentary provided by the first movie. Many of the racial/cultural issues are similarly avoided. It still has its fair share of racial stereotypes, but takes a completely different direction overall. Once again, it wouldn't be hard to brand this movie ""racist"" to an extent, but the stereotypical behavior is so outlandish that it doesn't elicit much reaction.

At the risk of over generalizing, this film will appeal more to stoners than anyone else. The sequel is on par with the original, but not particularly entertaining or anything special really. It's amusing, but if you never see it, you won't be missing a whole lot.

1642346,5,B00005PJ6S,"I saw a reference to Ralph Bakshi in a current Hobbit story, which referenced Bakshi's forgettable foray into Tolkien territory.  But, I remembered the x-rated animated toon of my teens - the only animated feature ever to give me a partial, right in the theatre.  Anyway, I got on Amazon later that day and bought Fritz and The Nine Lives of Fritz and allowed my wife to give me them for Xmas.  My wife thinks they are puerile, prurient, and amateurish, but I still like them.  I had forgotten that these were R. Crumb characters, which entails some hilarious, if not sophomoric social commentary on the pretensions of hippies and such.  All the prurient scenes are of pets and farm animals, so if you get turned on, well, that's your issue to deal with, for me I don't worry about that and just enjoy these classics from my youth.

The reason for me that this cartoon is SOO COOL is because of the MASSIVE FOUL LANGUAGE!!! The drugs and sex scenes were also cool (but don't worry they weren't THAT intense but still sicky), the concept of making fun of politicians was FUNNY and the cool character desing and animation were GREAT!

I think that the soundtrack could be better but the movie still AWESOME!.

This film is ever WORSE than Ren and Stinpy, Heavy Metal and Meet the Feebles! IS SOOOOO SICK AND DISSGUSTING!! But I like it!! Because is from the 70's and everything that is from the 70's is cool for me!!!  (I didn't know that the 70's was such a CRAZY decade).
