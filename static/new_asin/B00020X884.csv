2053345,5,B00020X884,"This is a good comedy starring: Brian Keith, Ernest Borgnine, Suzanne Pleshette, Don Ameche, Tom Ewell, Arthur O'Connell, Ivan Dixon, Bradford Dillman, John Fiedler, Tony Curtis and Christopher Mitchum in small roles. This movie runs about 113 minutes (1hr 53min) in Widescreen format (1.85:1) and is in color. It all starts with the local Sheriff not wanting the army in his town and the army making a deal of there own, when one of there own gets into trouble. I would recommend this.",1327190400,2,486,4.867469879518072

2053348,4,B00020X884,"This was one of the Movies that I could not play on my TV as it was the wrong Region. Also the Ronald Reagan,but have viewed them on my Computer. But it is not quite the same, as viewing on the TV. So how do I know before purchasing any DVD's if they are suitable for Australian viewing?",1259798400,,287,3.9655172413793105
2053349,2,B00020X884,"2 stars, one for each laugh. Read the reviews, but how could this cast make a movie that bad. They are all my favorite actors (except Tony Curtis) in one movie. Ok for a dollar I bought the movie. Watched and then put it in the give away pile. I have lots of public domain, black and white, full screen, blurry prints that I find more enjoyable to watch. A good study in how a great cast can be wasted. Tony Curtis roll in the movie (script fault) drug it down more. Hy Averback, the director has been great in  hour TV shows but doesn't seem to know what to do with a 1 hour movie. Tank, with James Garner, same type plot, is much better although not a comedy, it has it light moments. MGM has to have better movies to release. Oh yes. That's right, they did with their Midnight Movies series.",1245888000,,794,4.1558441558441555

2053351,1,B00020X884,wow. I'd forgotten just how many horribly bad movies were made during the late 60's & early 70's. A one note joke that lasts 89 minutes too long & wastes the talent of all involved.,1217376000,,181,4.2
2053352,2,B00020X884,"I remembered this as a really funny movie, but wasn't all that amused by it. I guess humor changes as times change.",1216425600,,115,4.2727272727272725
2053353,3,B00020X884,"Fantastic all star cast.  Lots of laughs.  It starts a little slow, doesn't have much of a plot but is entertaining. The war is between the local Army base and the local sheriff.",1126051200,4,178,4.363636363636363

8019778,1,B00020X884,Awful show - didn't even get 5 minutes watched.  Totally disappointed - the cast contains several of my favorite actors but the language and other things in the show did not lend to a family movie.,1428364800,,197,4.472222222222222
