195528,5,1574922815,"August Wilson's 'The Piano Player' with Charles Dutton and Alfre Woodard is such an engrossing play. This screen adaption brings you into there lives and makes you feel for every one in the movie. The writing 'superb'. The acting 'superb'. And the supporting cast is so top notch, you have to watch it more than once just to see all the scene stealers. This is a group that can send a complete message with just the raising of an eye, the shrugging of a shoulder, or the shaking of a head. You know what every gesture means. I now need 'Fences'.",1181606400,2,545,4.405940594059406
195529,5,1574922815,"Winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, August Wilson's lively domestic drama focuses on a black family in the 1930s and their piano, which dominates the living room of Doaker Charles and his niece Berniece in Pittsburgh.  The piano is adorned with the faces of their slave ancestors, carved by a distant relation who was owned by the Sutter family in Mississippi before Emancipation. Berniece's brother Boy Willie, recently released from a prison farm, has come to Pittsburgh from Mississippi with his friend Lymon, determined to sell this ancient piano in which he claims half-ownership.

Charles Dutton, as Boy Willie, Berniece's brother, endows his role with a humor and good-naturedness not obvious from a reading of the play, and his passion to use the money from the sale of the piano to buy a hundred acres of Sutter farmland, which his slave ancestors once worked, is palpable.  Courtney B., as Boy Willie's friend Lymon, is credulous and innocent as he explores the city, responding to its differences from the life on the farm, and bringing Berniece (Alfre Woodard) out of the grief she has borne since the shooting death of her husband three years before.  Woodard herself is a fierce Berniece, protective of her young daughter and determined to preserve the piano and its heritage.

Directed by Lloyd Richards for the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1995, the screenplay was adapted by August Wilson from his own play.  A bit shorter than the original, with offensive expletives omitted for television, the script remains close to the original.  When Sutter's ghost makes several appearances, the superstitions and folklore which have been part of the family's culture become both real and violent, and when Willie Boy, Lymon, Wining Boy (his gambler uncle, played by Lou Meyers), and uncle Doaker (Carl Gordon) sing, on several occasions, the viewer is reminded of the role of spirituals in black culture, their unifying spirit, and the dignity they inspired.

The appearances of Sutter's ghost and Boy Willie's battle with him create a sense of melodrama in this otherwise thoughtful battle between the reverence for the past (as seen in Berniece) and the hopes for the future (as seen in Boy Willie).  As a record of the era in which many blacks left the farms for the opportunities of the city, however, the play is unparalleled in its insights.  Mary Whipple",1104019200,28,2374,4.987341772151899
195530,5,1574922815,"If you are seriously into dramatic theatre plays, you may agree that re-creations made for movies or televisions are often substandard to the book!  In this case, the re-creation was geared toward television/movie quality rather than a reproduction of a stage theatre performance.

And if you are familiar with the works of August Wilson, you will recognize that to adher to the vernacular  - spoken language of a region - is critical to the element of his works.  In this DVD movie, the use of the N word was omitted and that omission is part of history.

African American playwright, August Wilson was born in 1945 and has received numerous, that include  Pulitzer Prize honors, ""Fences"" in 1987; and ""The Piano Lesson"" in 1990.  Each of his works chronicle a decade in black experience.  The Piano Lesson takes place in the depression era, the 30's.

The story revolves around an old carved upright piano that is symbolic with rich family history that dates back to trading slaves.  The carvings are stunning and each scene depicts a story filled with vivid description.  The plot includes supernatural elements.

Actor Charles Dutton has performed as other characters in Wilson's plays and here he plays Boy Willie.  With dreams of owning land like his ancestors, his plan involves selling a piano that belongs to him and his sister Berniece, played by the well-known Alfre Woodard.  However, the piano, an heirloom, is a representation of the past and she refuses to sell it.  The carvings were done by her grandfather, an enslaved plantation carpenter.

The movie version of the Piano Lesson was done quite well with some stunning performances by seasoned actors.  Like any well-written play with all the elements required, it lays heavy on meaningful and lengthy dialogue.

The Piano Lesson opened onstage in 1984 and became Wilson's second  Pulitzer Prize in 1990.  Supposedly, this Hallmark version is shortened and since I have not read the book, I cannot say how  true to the book it is.  ....MzRizz",1097452800,17,2010,4.955089820359281
195531,3,1574922815,"This story of heritage and culture verses ownership of land shows in detail a particular era for Black people. A family is divided as to the best purpose for an historically, beautifully carved piano.  This nearly 2  hr. video contains some excellent portrayal of the time and location.  It  also shows the hearts of a brother and sister.  The sister wants to hang  onto this token of her heritage, the brother wants to acquire land with  proceeds from the sale of the piano.  An expert in Black culture would be  able to tell if the scenes and expressions were entirely accurate.  I would  like to have seen some expansion on the story line as well.",959212800,6,650,4.565217391304348
