8225710,4,B000WTYVSQ,"I have about 10 of Billys DVD's. I work out 6 days a week, taking off Sunday. I use the Get Amped DVD's on Mondays because they are not that intense. I can ease back into my week a bit easier this way. Unless you have your room temperature set to over 100, or if the most heavy thing you lift up during an average day is a marshmallow to place in your hot chocolate, you aren't going to sweat much with this workout. I do feel that it is valuable, and produces some results. It has really nothing to do with the Amplifier however. I do have one that I use, but I have done the routine many times with simply two different length sticks from Home Depot that cost a whole lot less, and feel no difference between that, and using the Amplifier. As I said, It's a good Monday week starter workout.",1229040000,,793,4.122580645161291
8225711,5,B000WTYVSQ,"This DVD set is perfect for attacking and getting your abs and buns in shape. You can feel a difference after one workout and it is very easy to set up a routine that works for you. I recommend getting the amplifier so you can keep up the same pace and won't have as hard of a time keeping your balance. The pounds will really melt once you get into your routine. If you are thinking about getting this to try out, I suggest you go ahead and invest in the TAEBO AMPED with the amplifier (you get 5 DVDs and the amplifier). Trust me it will sound expensive, but once you get into doing TAEBO you'll realize that you actually saved money by getting the 5 DVDs and the amplifier at once. I now regret not getting it when I had the chance, because an amplifier by itself is $19.99.

All in all this DVD is still worth it even if you don't get the amplifier.",1203552000,2,853,4.107784431137724
