4330099,1,B004CYF7JO,Only 30 minutes long. Not worth it.,1428105600,,35,4.142857142857143

4330101,1,B004CYF7JO,I'm not sure why they even bother releasing these. The segments are cut off. Don't expect 2 songs from Frankie as they talk about. They cut Frank Sinatra!!!! Most of the couch interviews are cut. The quality looks as if they made these dvd from VHS tapes. Terrible. Don't waste your time and money on these.,1426118400,3,307,4.5
4330102,3,B004CYF7JO,"It's cute, but not one of the best shows.  I did enjoy it, but if you're looking to show someone under 30 what the Tonight show was like, this may not be the best choice.",1425340800,,170,3.857142857142857
4330103,5,B004CYF7JO,Great,1424390400,,5,5.0
4330104,5,B004CYF7JO,"Great insight of the show, entertainer, and the man behind the persona. He made the art of getting a laugh from a bombed joke look so easy. He is still missed today by those of us that he held spell bound for so many nights of those bygone years. It is great to have those episodes  available for us to recapture the genus  of his craft and they are just as hilarious today as when they aired.",1418169600,,393,4.090909090909091
4330105,5,B004CYF7JO,"Johnny Carson is a classic. I loved watching him again. I will buy more episodes and recommend them to others.
Great memories. You never knew what he was up to next!",1393027200,,165,4.354838709677419
4330106,5,B004CYF7JO,"The only contribution I make to this purchase is whether one can ""play it more than once.""  Perhaps a
statement (for ? like me).  ""This may be  viewed as many times as desired  .OR  NOT viewed but once.."" This is the FIRST time I've ordered a video and maybe it was stated but I am still unclear...
Other than that...fast hook up and great video!

Thanks",1371945600,,354,4.287878787878788
4330107,3,B004CYF7JO,"Only 30 minutes of a somewhat fuzzy, and disappointingly short excerpt of a show, but we laughed regardless. He was the best.",1360108800,,125,4.7272727272727275

8423860,1,B004CYF7JO,An embarrassment -- such a poorly produced archive with only some of the original guests.,1503360000,,89,5.0
8423861,3,B004CYF7JO,Price is too steep. I am pretty sure $1.99 for one (1) half hour show. Not so sure we will do that again.,1491350400,,105,3.608695652173913
