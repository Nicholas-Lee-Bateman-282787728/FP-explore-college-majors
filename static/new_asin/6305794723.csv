Two young students one from shaolin and another a student of tai chi join forces to stop him before it's too late.  The two young men find out that they have more in common then they ever imagined before, and that they were more closely connected to the Evil killer then they would ever have wanted.  Breath taking fight scenes, Great Drunken staff showcased, and some great Tai chi kung fu aswell.  Eagle Han is again a great villian.  Gotta see this one.",990576000,3,539,4.459183673469388
