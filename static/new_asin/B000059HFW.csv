The hit CBS show Touched by an Angel and its flagship episode ""The Spirit of Liberty Moon"" have taken on the gross human rights abuses going on inside Communist China.
  Rarely, if ever, has a popular television program tackled such an important issue against the grain of political correctness. (...)
At the beginning of ""The Spirit of Liberty Moon,"" actor Richard Gere, who is concerned with human rights issues in Tibet, appears on screen with opening remarks about China's misdeeds in Tibet and persecution of Christians inside its own nation.
  The episode unfolds in this way:
  A Chinese woman who survived the Tiananmen Square protests has run away from the Chinese Secret Police. She gets a good job in Hong Kong where she works as translator for a big business outfit. The woman is working with greedy Western men.
  However, the angels on Touched by an Angel are working to change the hearts of the business men. The business men go to China to sell a new kind of kite and they take the Chinese translator with them on this journey.
  Through a series of events the business men find out about China's slave labor factories and gulags. One of the investors has second thoughts about investing in China because of the human rights abuses. Meanwhile, the female translator finds her husband who is working in a slave labor factory. The two of them meet.  It is a memorable moment. The audience learns that the couple had a child -- a daughter, who is alive and well inside China.
  Of the greedy business men (there are two), one is a lawyer and he goes back to New York before this unfolds. He says, ""We were friends for 20 years, we made a deal to divide and conquer the world, get rich by 42 and retire young enough to enjoy it.""
  The Angel says ""You can make a difference.""
  He says then; ""I don't want to make a difference. I just want to make money.""
  And she says, ""What would it profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his own soul.""
  When the translator finds the courage to stop running away from her past and take on the wicked ideals of the Chinese Communist leadership the audience experiences real bravery and an uplifting scene. Near the end of the show, the translator picks up a microphone in Tiananmen Square begins to speak aloud.
  Everyone in Tiananmen square can hear her. She says, ""I am tired of running away, we are patriotic Chinese and we must save China. There is a God and also we must fight the evil for the sake of our children.""
  Eventually, the translator's husband dies in the slave labor factory from mistreatment. But things get even worse for her. After her outburst in the Square, the PLA arrest her, and beat her. She is going to die. But then Monica, the star angel, comes into her cell and appears as a bright light. She tells the Chinese translator, ""I am an Angel. God admires your courage. I have so much to learn from you. I have come to be with you when you die.""
(...)  At the end of the episode, the angels find the translator's daughter, and one of the greedy business men helps adopt her (the daughter had been in an orphanage).
  What is so beautiful is that the daughter is named Liberty Moon and one of the angels has invented a kite and she gives it to the big toy company with the logo of liberty moon on it, and the little girl finds them flying it at Tiananmen Square. She knows that it is from her mother.
  At the end of the episode I cried because the Chinese woman was so brave and noble, unlike wicked and pathetic leaders like Clinton and Co., the globalist Republicans and their like-minded cronies in Europe, such as Tony Blair.
(...) Let's NEVER forget the Spirit of Liberty Moon.",1005004800,15,3782,4.470845481049563
