You are not going to be fed entertainment by explosions or CGI. You need to have your brain plugged in.,1254700800,2,261,4.24

7901669,5,0971239304,"Director Glen Grefe's first full-length feature film is a testament to why Independent features are produced. This self proclaimed ""no budget"" thriller kept me enthralled from beginning to end. Unlike other films that finish their character development within the first half hour or so, Nutcracker's characters are ever changing and evolving which keeps the viewer's interest better than many big budget films. The first reason I decided to view this film was the inclusion of David Hess to the cast. Hess has been one of my favorite Horror/Suspense actors since the mid 1980s, so naturally this film was a must-see for me. In addition to Hess, I found the film to be solidly acted throughout. I thought Bill Bragg turned in a great performance as Dr. Carlton Fairfax, and I absolutely loved Darian O'Toole's performance as the Vampiress who is not quite ready to face the world without her beloved therapist, and of course, the most subtle and underlying character in this movie was the setting itself, the gorgeous city of San Francisco, whose beauty is skillfully displayed with the film's excellent camera work. This film is also paced very nicely, and with a relatively short running time (approx. 1:20), it is an easy film to digest. I highly recommend this film to fans of Suspense Thrillers or Giallo films, as well as any fans of the work of the unmistakable David Hess! A funny side note, the film has great audio, so convincing in fact that when Carlton rings Sierra's doorbell, my 2 dogs go absolutely bonkers! Probably the only movie I own that gets a reaction like that, my hat's off to whoever mixed the audio!",1158710400,5,1625,4.848920863309353
7901670,5,0971239304,"I'm a long time fan of Darian O'Toole, one of the stars of your movie and while I was willing to except a cheesy indie horror flick, I was more than pleasantly surpised to find a sophisticated, funny, eerie and chilling drama/suspense film. Your casting of Darian (don't worry I won't ruin it) is inspired and the only bad thing I could say is where was our diva during the middle of the film? Inspired! My Gawd she's amazing on screen! Kudos to Grefe, Hess and most of all, the alluring and brilliant Darian! And FYI, I'm real!

7901671,4,0971239304,"Crazy David Hess at his best - plays a nutcase with a wide range of insanity... good ideas, slick look, some-times stretched, but mentally deranged and delightful!  Very different than a lot of no-brainer stuff out there - it's got aspirations of Hitchcock and Lynch, but still a popcorn flick.",1032393600,7,294,4.88
7901672,1,0971239304,"easily one of the worst movies ever..no plot,characters,or anything. Get something with substance like American History X.",1029024000,2,122,6.235294117647059
