5787585,5,B00DBPBQN6,"You get a lot of his way of working and if you include a lot of his interviews from various sources (Comic's Journal, Juxtapoz) you will get a vast amount information about Mr. Williams. His art is what inspired the direction of the illustrative fine art scene of the 90's until today. There are pros and cons to the movement, but the very best are always well deserving of their success.",1404000000,3,388,4.47887323943662

5787587,5,B00DBPBQN6,As sophisticated and intelligent as his paintings...great documentary. No words can well describe this man. You have to see for yourself....,1393286400,,140,5.714285714285714
5787588,5,B00DBPBQN6,"I've been a fan of RW for years, so I was really excited to see this.  Entertaining, funny doc on an amazing artist.  My problem is, I've loaned it to friends and can't seem to get it back.",1391126400,2,189,3.9473684210526314
5787589,3,B00DBPBQN6,"I liked it but I felt it could have been more focused on Mr. Williams.  Too many side stories that caused me to lose focus.
Interviews from his followers and supporters were good, just a little too drawn out. I just felt like the story only touched the surface of the man.",1382659200,3,272,4.230769230769231
5787590,5,B00DBPBQN6,"The artistic minds of late 21st century will have forgotten the art that came out of Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock's New York lofts, but they'll make pilgrimages to Robert Williams California garage. Like Muslims longing to stand on the same grains of sand as stood the prophet.

This is a great film and a must for anyone trying to understand the Post WWII counter cultural art movement, that sprang out of California in the last half of the twentieth century. Rich in the history of decedent American art. The film also follows Williams associations with other Iconic Counter Culture Figures like Griffin, Mouse and Crumb.",1379548800,4,626,4.90566037735849
5787591,5,B00DBPBQN6,"Mr. Bitchin' is an intimate look at the life and work of one of our greatest artists. Robert Williams knows what ""Diddy Wa Diddy"" means. His genius at aberrant artistry creates tiny time capsules of contrdiction in the minds of unsuspecting viewers. The filmmakers are to be congratulated. This is my favorite documentary of 2013 and it's only September.",1379203200,4,354,5.016949152542373

8591466,5,B00DBPBQN6,"If it wasn't for people like Robert Williams, I'd think I was on the wrong planet. Kudos to producer Nancye Ferguson for daring to present to the world at large the deviant mind of one of America's greatest artists. I paused on the still photograph of Williams and the other Zap artists (Moscoso, Wilson, Crumb, Spain, Shelton, and Griffin) and just basked in the glory of the people who did more to shape my being than my parents, church, and government ever did! Crumb had his documentary, and now the equally deserving Williams gets his. I wish that Ms. Ferguson would give a similar treatment to S. Clay Wilson. I highly recommend this documentary to anybody who is a fan of Zap, UG comix in general, and art that slams past the eyeballs and goes straight for the jugular.",1414454400,,776,4.589928057553957
8591467,5,B00DBPBQN6,Mr. Bitchin' was once in a life time chance to enter the not only the mind of Robert Williams but see him as a person. The sound quality left something to be desired but given the task of editing years of tape someone gets a free pass.,1407196800,,235,4.0212765957446805
