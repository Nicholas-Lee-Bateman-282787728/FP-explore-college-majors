6935967,1,B00RW19EUM,"If you read the description that is posted on here, and it is taken from the blurb on the back of the movie, the movie is totally different. There is no black hole destroying the sun and no space arks to save humanity in this moviearks. The blurb and movie do not match up. When you buy the movie based on the blurb it really is frustrating when they are two seperate movies.  Not recommended.",1431129600,7,393,4.24
6935968,2,B00RW19EUM,"Billionaire William Hadden (David Rintoul) is collecting crystal skulls from around the world in Vienna. He is in a wheel chair and ""doesn't have much time."" He has twelve skulls. There is a group known as ""The Brotherhood"" protecting the 13th skull, the one skull to rule them all. There is no albino in the group. The best hope for locating the 13th skull fall into the lap of John Winston (Richard Burgi) who is a bad imitation of Indian Jones.

The film was poorly written. The opening scenes of gathering the skulls were reminiscent of the Indian Jones warehouse housing artifacts as well as a quick Mission Impossible snatch. Nothing like an Englishman doing business with an Eastern European in a remote Andean village bar with a suitcase full of money.

When the film wasn't imitating other films, the science was off the charts. There was talk of carbon dating crystal skulls to 500,000 years ago. First you can't carbon date crystal skulls. Secondly, carbon dating has a limitation of about 40,000 years. The science was all over the place.

Then there was dad's notebook Winston was using to locate the skull, and maybe find his dad too. This was a big ""huh"" moment as to how he has the book in the first place. This was answered later on in great length.

The acting was bad as was the dialogue. The CG plane made me laugh as did the reporters speaking in front of a fake background. Colonel Baily (J.R. Esposito) seemed to have been modeled after Daniel Tosh as part of NATO's not ask don't tell force.

The film displayed some Asylum grade cheese, i.e. it is so bad it was funny. The description ""It is 2020 and the apocalypse is inevitable. Due to a rapidly growing Black Hole headed straight for the Sun, Earth begins to fall into darkness."" has nothing to do with this film. It is at IMDB and has become the official Amazon description. It should be ignored. This is an Indian Jones style film for people who hate decent sound tracks, good plot, and acting. Kids might like it. No swearing sex, or nudity.",1429315200,4,2022,4.574585635359116

6935977,4,B00RW19EUM,I enjoyed the movie and do not regret spending the money to stream it but being a long time fan of science fiction fantasy and horror I had other expectations preconceptions if you will of it.it seemed well produced not a cheap production by any means but it could have been perhaps a lot more intelligent in terms of exploring the possibilities of what the skulls really were.for instance when they finally found the thirteenth skull I guess I was hoping for some type of interaction between it any humans that we're trying to use it for their own and purposes. perhaps a ai intelligence as we understand it that would make them aware of their lack of maturity and using the powers possessed by them.also they could have created a language a meth house a civilization surrounding the skulls and what their purpose originally was intended for.are they in fact something that is intended for the human race at a later point in our evolve ment when we finally reached the stage where we are united as one species.what was their original intention for use with the skulls as a means of protection or assisting the human race at some point for some reason.these and other reasons could have been explored in the film.,1431648000,3,1213,4.6465116279069765
