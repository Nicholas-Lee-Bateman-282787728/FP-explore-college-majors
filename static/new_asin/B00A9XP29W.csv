5401717,3,B00A9XP29W,I bought this because I wanted two 30 minute workouts but these are over forty. Jari Love is a good teacher and the workouts work you which is good. I just wish the advertising was real.,1360281600,4,186,4.194444444444445
5401718,3,B00A9XP29W,"Jari's workouts are my favorites. I can't wait until she comes out with more. I was disappointed that the soundtrack is mostly the same as another DVD. With high reps and not much jumping around to keep it fresh, something has to be new.  I'm pretty good with repetition and don't mind doing a workout over and over again, but when I get a new one I want it to feel new for a little while at least.  I was half-way bored with this one on day one because I'd already heard most of this soundtrack over and over.",1359936000,5,510,4.141414141414141
5401719,5,B00A9XP29W,This workout is super flexible on different levels.  Some sets were done without weights and it was a challenge.  This is one DVD that is worth adding to my collection.,1359763200,,168,4.566666666666666
5401720,5,B00A9XP29W,Great workout. Not boring and very challenging.  This workout does remind me of her older dvds.  I surely felt sore the next few days.,1358294400,8,134,4.541666666666667
5401721,5,B00A9XP29W,"Received this new DVD a few days ago.  Finally had a moment to use it.  They lower body series really gives you an excellent workout.  I am sore today.  Jari is the modern day Joanie Greggins.  Very upbeat and positive.  I was suprised to see Leslye do a segment on this DVD and she was pleasantly good.  All of Jari Love's DVD's give you a good overall body workout.  I am adding this one into my rotation.  It is over an hour, so schedule the time for yourself to get a good burn in.",1358121600,6,485,4.074468085106383
5401722,4,B00A9XP29W,A good workout from Jari Love....same as all the other ripped Workouts with little differences here and there. Love Jari Love,1357603200,4,125,5.0
5401723,5,B00A9XP29W,Good workout,1441152000,,12,5.5
5401724,1,B00A9XP29W,Not sure about the workoun on the DVD because it froze and skipped and jumped throughout.  Amazon made good on a refund but was annoyed so didn't bother getting a new one.,1420934400,,171,4.34375
5401725,5,B00A9XP29W,"Wow
Great strength work out! New moves in this DVD.",1417737600,,51,4.2
5401726,5,B00A9XP29W,Jari is pretty consistent and this is a great workout tape.  One of my favs.,1414281600,,76,4.066666666666666
5401727,5,B00A9XP29W,"Jari Love never disappoints me!  Yes, there is a lot of repetition, but that is how you build a better body!  With her videos and a good diet, I have lost lots of inches!  She is encouraging and not annoying.  Love her workouts!",1412467200,,228,4.232558139534884
5401728,5,B00A9XP29W,"this workout is kickass! i am currently doing it and i see results. its great for beginners too. there are two segments , upper body and lower body. You can do them separately or together. I love this workout. She includes modifications for beginners and advanced folks. I see a difference in my body despite having a high carb diet.",1401235200,4,333,4.566666666666666
5401729,5,B00A9XP29W,"I loved this dvd from the first time I did it.  I even enjoy the warm up, which I often skip on many other dvds as it seems to be mainly stretching but Jari gets you moving right off and I feel great to start the rest of the workout.  After the warm up she does crouching squats, which look a bit funny but they are incredibly effective!  I usually end up getting sore from doing this dvd and I would consider myself in pretty good shape.  My daughter also works out and is in track at school and she did this dvd and could barely walk two days later!  It does advertise that it has 2-30 minute workouts, which is misleading as they are indeed each longer than 30 min.  But the way it is set up you could do only 30 min by just stopping before the segment is entirely over.  I usually keep this one for when I have a day off so that I can do the 40+ min. segments and get the full effect.  I have done the entire workout in one session and if you do it that way be aware that it is very long....longer than an hour.  Haven't had time to do the entire thing lately but believe me, you will get a great workout by just doing either of the shorter workouts.  One reviewer mentioned that there is no cardio on this.  While I wouldn't consider it to be a cardio workout, there are certain segments that definitely get your heart pumping and get the sweat pouring.  If that isn't cardio, I'm not sure what is!  I find it to be a nice mix of cardio and strength.  I know I feel great after I'm done!",1400716800,15,1492,4.013559322033898
5401730,1,B00A9XP29W,DVD skips. Tried it in multiple players and always the same result... My workout is cut short! Don't waste your money!,1392681600,,118,4.666666666666667
5401731,3,B00A9XP29W,"If this was just an upper body workout,I would have given it 5 stars ,because I really think the Upper body segment is amazing but the lower body segment just didn't challenge me at all. My lower half is my problem half and as a result I have purchased so many
lower body dvds. I like that Jari splits it up,so I can choose to just do the upper body. This is my only dvd by her and I find her very encouraging and even though she has a perfect body,she doesn't seem snooty or unapproachable. I would recommend this if only for the arm work-my muscles are throbbing during as well as hours later!",1390608000,3,595,4.182608695652174
5401732,5,B00A9XP29W,This is a great workout to get muscle definition....I really like how the modifications are shown and advice given as the workout progresses,1382054400,,140,5.130434782608695
5401733,5,B00A9XP29W,"I started using Jari Love's workout videos in March of this year. Within two weeks, I started noticing a difference in my arms and thighs. I do not need to lose weight or have a weight problem, I do it for toning, and now, 3 months later, I have gained 7 pounds of muscle. My clothes fit better and I feel great. I am really happy so far and I alternate between videos. I do a video for about 4-6 weeks, then either switch the dvd, or up my weights. I could never do pull ups, pushups, etc. before these videos, now I can and my strength is only increasing. I never write reviews for anything I buy, but I can honestly say, that these videos are finally the workout I can enjoy in my own home at my convenience!!!",1372118400,8,713,4.1
5401734,5,B00A9XP29W,I have several other get ripped videos but this one really challenges me. i really do get fatigued and cannot keep up with all of the reps on every set!,1369872000,2,152,4.1
5401735,4,B00A9XP29W,"This video will work you but is some what old school. Hard to keep motivated. Oddly enough, I do like it though. Just won't use it daily but between other work outs.",1369872000,,165,4.1875
5401736,4,B00A9XP29W,"I'm a huge Jari fan and have all of her advanced workouts, including Bootcamp. This DVD workout gets really boring if done in the 60-minute format; endless repetitions of the same movement. Enough Already!
By comparison, my very favorite Jari Love workout is ""Get Ripped And Chiseled,"" which is still fun to do.
""Get Ripped 1000"" and that whole series include intervals, and that doesn't get boring, either.
These are traditional weight lifting exercises, nothing fancy, but they're very, very effective. Not just for women.",1369094400,3,524,5.176470588235294
5401737,5,B00A9XP29W,"I have three of her DVDs.  I think she is great.  This DVD's routines are different and effective.  It broken down in two routines, one upper and one lower.  I don't have a lot time so the 35 minute routines work well for me.  I can alternate them and do cardio in between.",1365638400,3,273,4.0754716981132075
5401738,5,B00A9XP29W,"I love this workout and have done it several times.  Challenging workout, but fun at the same time.  Jari has outdone herself.",1365379200,,126,4.681818181818182
5401739,5,B00A9XP29W,"Challenging workout! I love that most of the exercises simultaneously work at least two body parts plus your core. Note that while there's a ""lower body"" and ""upper body"" segment to the DVD, both halves work both parts. I actually had to go buy lighter weights since I couldn't complete all the reps of some sections (like the anterior raises). It would be helpful to have a step bench, but I use a milk crate that works great for the seated exercises. The other reviewer who commented on the repetitiveness has a point, but reps bring results. Without the video, few of us would do this many push ups or dead lifts on our own. I have been doing this a couple times a week since it came out in December...still not bored yet and seeing/feeling the results - great return on investment!",1362873600,18,785,4.496503496503497
5401740,5,B00A9XP29W,This workout is challenging and incorporates new multi-part moves which are fun and interesting. Not the same old Jari Love DVD. I recommend it.,1362355200,,144,5.041666666666667
5401741,3,B00A9XP29W,"I have to say up front that I really enjoy working out with Jari Love. she is a supportive, encouraging instructor and she knows her stuff! I have almost all her DVDs and enjoy the balance between cardio and strength training. This one fell a bit short for me. You will get a good strength workout, but be aware that there is essentially no cardio. This is not a bad thing, you just need to be aware of what you're getting.
she uses tried and true exercises, no fanfare, but the reps seem to go on forever. Even the women working out with her in the DVD seem to get a bit tired of doing the same move ad infinitum. You will feel the muscle burn but I got bored. Also, in the cons category the ""background"" music seemed a bit too loud and was obtrusive.
still if you can push past the distracting music and repetitive repetitions, this might be one for you.",1361577600,23,856,4.225609756097561
5401742,5,B00A9XP29W,This is another brilliant workout dvd from Jari Love.  I have most of her dvds now and if you want a gym quality dvd at home then Jari is for you.  I cannot recommend it enough.,1361318400,,177,3.888888888888889

8548790,5,B00A9XP29W,"No one brings the burn like Jari!  This is my favorite of the 7 DVDs of her's that I own, absolutely every single track will have you at super burn!  two weeks of doing the workouts alternating 4-5x per week and my shoulders are already poppin!  Thank you, Jari!!",1508976000,,263,4.326530612244898

8548793,3,B00A9XP29W,Liked the ripped and lean and the ripped and chiseled better,1493596800,,60,4.545454545454546
8548794,3,B00A9XP29W,I love Jari Love. I love this video. The segments are not 30 minutes. They are 45 minutes when done individually. That is a big difference when your time is budgeted.,1489968000,,166,4.387096774193548

8548798,5,B00A9XP29W,"I workout to Jari at least 4-5 times a week. She's the only one who has made my workouts feel worth it. Muscle definition can actually be seen unlike a lot of other workouts. This workout is def challenging, but you get results fast! Love Jari.",1459123200,2,244,4.326086956521739
