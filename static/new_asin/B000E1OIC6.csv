I am 50 something and wanted to stay flexible. I did not like the AM workout at all.  Not enough of a workout for me.  If you aren't really athletic, it would be helpful.  The other two dvd's were much better and had challenging yoga poses.  I feel great after I do them.  Don't know if Amazon will let me say, but I paid $7. for all 3.  I looked later and they had it for $35!!  Would not pay that!!",1324339200,,560,3.9375
8104119,2,B000E1OIC6,"I love the other Gaiam programs and products. I bought this set thinking that it would be a fast paced home session that might actually burn a calorie or two. Wrong! The DVDs are actually AM/PM yoga for Weight loss and Yoga Conditioning for Weight loss, with a total running time of about twenty minutes each.

The AM/ PM disks are very slow. If I was to actually use them in the AM/ PM I might have fallen asleep. The Conditioning program has multiple instructors to fallow, each demonstrating your fitness level with slightly to completely modified poses. The modifications are very easy. Beginners probably will be capable of doing the full pose with only slight modification to a few.  If you have health problems some of the modifications may work for you but they didn't help me.

I did appreciate that Gaiam used real women in the DVD. This also points out that yoga alone will never get you looking like Suzie what's her name. The set is a good place to start if you are just becoming active however, if you have done any yoga before... get a different tape.

If you'd like to purchase the set mine's on eBay!",1234828800,3,1117,4.514851485148514
8104120,1,B000E1OIC6,"this is basically a package consisting of two suzanne deason dvds, Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss and AM PM Yoga for Weight Loss, spread across three dvds. the yoga practices are very fine work, worth four or five stars individually, but i have cut this down to one star because the repackaging may cause people to think the Quick Start and Maintenance dvds are new and different than the AM/PM dvd. also, at this writing, the package costs more than the individual dvds. shame on you, gaiam!

Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss is a popular gentle beginners' practice, about 45 minutes in length, demonstrating four different levels of practice from beginner to most advanced. It presents a balanced practice of standing poses, backbends, core work, forward bends and twists. suzanne deason's AM PM Yoga for Weight Loss is also a fine dvd, providing a similar kind of practice, in shorter, more focused versions. there is a morning and evening practice and bonus workout, each simple and short (more or less 25 min. each) and well cued, with modifications for beginners in the morning and evening segments. the morning practice focuses on standing poses and backbends. The evening practice focuses on shoulder opening and forward bends. The bonus breathwork workout is more advanced and does not present modifications. it focuses on integrating breath and movement in more challenging standing poses, backbends, and core work.

two dvds included here present the same workouts as the AM/PM dvd. Quick Start Yoga for Weight Loss is the AM portion of the original dvd, and Maintenance Yoga for Weight Loss is the PM portion of the original, plus the dvd's bonus workout on cd. if you want all of these suzanne deason practices on dvd, you can just buy Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss and AM PM Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss separately. you will end up with two dvds including all the practices contained here on three dvds and one cd, for less money.",1155513600,51,1957,4.927272727272728
