8686999,5,B00P8RUSIE,"There can be no controversy about the stature of Apollo, and I would think little about Bugaku.  Both receive splendid performances here.  My only disappointment was that in Bugaku Edward Villella does not dance  the role in which he was so electric.  Jean Pierre Bonnefous is, however, more than satisfying in it.  Not a definitive performance of either ballet, but a fine documentation of the wondrous choreography.",1430179200,12,417,5.164179104477612
