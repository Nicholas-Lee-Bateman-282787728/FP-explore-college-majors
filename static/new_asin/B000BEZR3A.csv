In the 60's or 70's, a man and a woman from opposite bacgrounds and opposite personalities become entangle while trying to fix the world, as characteristic from those years.  The result is a boy to whom the mother choose to raise by herself (a feminist).  The boy does not know who his father is, and when he is seventeen and hooked on genetics (as characteristic from later years) he goes in search of his father and what follows is enchanting. All the actors are great and also the soundtrack and the escenary. I love this movie.",1228262400,,661,4.446280991735537
