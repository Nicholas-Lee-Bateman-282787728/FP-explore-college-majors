8169458,5,B000CQZGQ0,"First saw this film on TV a hundred years ago as a teenager.  Has stayed with me ever since and have hoped I would see it once more.  Finally it is now available on Amazon in American format DVD and I promptly bought it.  The movie was just as intriguing as I remembered it - religion, guilt, sex, maternal love, violence, emotional dysfunction.  What more could be asked for?  The studio sets are a bit hokey but this is a post WWII British film and should be forgiven.",1321228800,7,470,4.295454545454546
8169459,4,B000CQZGQ0,I've been looking for this movie on DVD for several years.  The DVD-R version from Retro Flix is very basic; it does not include any menus or extras.  However the black and white images are excellent and the sound quality is very good.  Thanks to Retro Flix for making this movie available on DVD!,1288396800,8,297,4.462962962962963

8169461,5,B000CQZGQ0,"People (amazon.com) sos.. I want the movie not a refund..it's seems held up..and late..unless a couple of grannies lifted it LOL..having a problem getting thru to yas on the order..had to go through return (never received) so I told yas I want the movie..may be just late..@#!!&$happens..can't change my rating..still decent flic..Good Work Retro Flic / amazon.com for restoring copy..

Good work amazon.com I will be ordering my copy (usa compat) shortly..this movie should be avertised with Sophia Loren and all the other back in the day babe movies..yeah it's a chick flic from the past..but what makes it cool..is I had made a challenge to the older crowd.. people who aren't familiar with amazon's ability to hunt down impossible ( hard to find oldies) and restore them and make them available to the consumer's..these (hard to find oldies) are gems to the older folk..and I am 100% positive they would purchase them..if they knew they were available.. And as for the Movie..I guess this was kinda like your Twilight old School..with no Vamps & Wolfpeople..though I am sure there are some villians..
a Gothic Romance from 1945..
Good Work once again amazon..I'm out..",1273622400,3,1172,5.041237113402062
