I would consider buying the dvd if it weren't TRIPLE the original dvd price!  Even so, I don't think I'd pay $20-$25, which is what it might have been either (because that's still overpriced), but never $64...for 3 episodes at that!!
Disappointing that people try to overcharge for stuff...):",1467763200,,408,4.652777777777778

If you have never watched Saiyuki, know that if you purchase Gunlock Volume 5, you will likely not know what is going on as each disc in this series leaves a cliff-hanger.

Also, in discussion of special feature/extras, the Gunlock series has added a ""music video"" section that I find highly amusing. MTV look out! I enjoy the quips and sarcasm as well as the adrenaline that comes with the daily danger of being associated with Sanzo and Scripture. For the Gunlock series, it seems that the lead bad guys have gone from the routine ambush tactics to just plain stalking. Hazel is just creepy...",1174435200,,889,4.685897435897436
8143485,5,B000I2JSY4,If you like Saiyuki and you are enjoying the series i recommend this dvd to bridge the gap between Vol ume 4 and 6.  Geneon went and put out this much demanded dvd when everyone who had seen disc 4 and got confused by the massive jump in events when they saw 6.  Geneon heard their cries and went back in time to put out disc 5 in between the 2 dvds so the gap could be bridged.,1172102400,,378,3.8333333333333335
