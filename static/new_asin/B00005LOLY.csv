7944118,5,B00005LOLY,"I think this was one of Maggie Cheung's best performances. She plays a wannabe actress who is using men to pay for room and board. Kenny Bee plays the taxi driver who ends up with Maggie as his neighbor. They dislike each other at first sight. Slowly, he comes to understand that her life is no cakewalk underneath the glamorous clothes. Nice romance develops between the two despite the hardships that are encountered. Good chemistry between the leads.",1095120000,,453,4.82051282051282
7944119,4,B00005LOLY,There is nothing fishy about this story of the relationship between an unlicensed cab driver and an aspiring actress during the turbulent 1960s Hong Kong. A must have for Maggie Cheung fans.,1028592000,,190,4.96875
