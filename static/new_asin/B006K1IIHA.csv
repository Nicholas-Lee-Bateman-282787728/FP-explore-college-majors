5000364,5,B006K1IIHA,"Plenty of DVD players in the US have codes which will make them region-free and therefore able to play DVDs from around the world. From personal experience, I just had to enter a sequence of numbers on the remote and it worked instantly. Super easy. I'd recommend doing your research first: figure out if your DVD player has codes to become region-free. If not, consider buying a DVD player that can. You can also switch the region on you computer, but only a limited number of times before it gets stuck. Maybe there's a way around that as well, but I've never tried.

Okay, my review on Sherlock: Ridiculously good. I was hesitant when I learned it was a modern adaptation, but it's done flawlessly. The writing, acting, and cinematography are fantastic. My only problem with the series as a whole is the episode count and the almost two-year wait in between new seasons. On the other hand, only having six, 90-minute episodes means you can jump in very quickly without having to catch up on hours upon hours of material. Overall: A+++",1364083200,11,1037,4.666666666666667
5000365,5,B006K1IIHA,"I loved Moffett's work in Couplings, heard he was good in Doctor Who, and got blown away with his Holmes treatments. That was only the basis that they built the best Holmes ever.  The actors are the icing that makes this the most watchable Holmes of all time. I want more and more and more.  Come on Steven get cracking.",1356912000,22,320,4.316666666666666
5000366,5,B006K1IIHA,"Wonderful series. Suspenseful and well made, direction, acting, everything.

Blu-ray is region free BUT, only plays on certain players because of BBC formatting. From my experience, WILL PLAY ON SAMSUNG, WILL NOT PLAY ON SONY. I don't know about additional brands.

5000371,4,B006K1IIHA,this was a way cheaper option than buying both series separately in US format. i simply had to look up how to make my dvd player region free and viola! works like a charm! this show is amazing. I'm so glad there is a modernized Sherlock Holmes series! now if only we could not have to wait for series' once every 2 years..,1452988800,2,322,4.126984126984127

5000374,5,B006K1IIHA,"Outstanding series!  Cumberbatch is delightfully engaging, and Freeman makes a woderful sidekick as Dr. Watson (who now is a survivor and former soldier sent to the Aghanistan conflict). Bringing Sherlock Holmes into the 21st Century, updating the myriad modern technologies available to law enforcement and society doesn't impair Holmes ""deduction by observation"" it enhances it. Relying on other reviewers who wrote these discs are NOT designed for North American play but playable on Samsung blu ray players, I took a chance and was rewarded.  They play just fine on my Samsung player (which btw is several years old); so if you own a Samsung device there should no problem. HIGHLY RECOMMEDED.",1440115200,2,696,5.261261261261262

5000383,5,B006K1IIHA,Wow this is beyond good.  If you like mysteries and a touch of the bbc magic this show is for you.  You will love the actors they bring the characters to life.  If you happen to be a Conan Doyle fan like me its fun to watch the shows and figure out where the stories originate from.  A very well done show I hope it stays around for more years to come.,1403568000,,352,3.8472222222222223
5000384,5,B006K1IIHA,"Great entertainment, and I could watch Cumberbatch all day long.  Rather than thinking of this series as episodes, due to their length you need to consider each it's own movie sequel.",1400803200,,183,4.903225806451613

5000386,2,B006K1IIHA,"My husband and I enjoyed Sherlock on Netflix so much I decided to buy it.  I was very disappointed when it wouldn't play on a PS2 or Sony blu ray but only on my computer blu ray player.  Since that means my husband and I couldn't enjoy them together I ended up buying them again on DVD, which played just fine.",1398556800,,310,4.065573770491803

It started with the bbc start up stuff, but never goes to play.  Very, very disappointed!!",1396051200,,255,4.361702127659575
5000389,5,B006K1IIHA,"If you have a laptop and can somehow find the rare and horribly expensive (not) HDMI cable, and if you have a television that has an HDMI port, you can watch practically anything. It's worth it to me to do it this way because 1) it's no big deal, and 2) the British version has the special features that I enjoy very much, and 3) why spend money to buy a different player when I actually have a solution at hand? As for the value of this 2-set series, if I were any more pleased I would have to sell all my belongings and move to London so that I could stalk the filmings. This whole series makes me happy. For anyone who has not seen it, you can stream it as I did. The memorable and clever dialogue, the inventive photography, the rare chemistry between Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch, the music, and probably other elements I'm not even aware of combine to deliver satisfaction to whatever place I sit and watch. I bought the DVDs because backing up to rewatch something while streaming is devilishly annoying and streaming doesn't give the special features.",1395532800,4,1070,4.492307692307692
5000390,1,B006K1IIHA,"We purchased these DVDs on the promise that they were ""region-free"" and for ""all regions"" as stated above in the product description.  That is NOT the case.  This DVD will not play on American players.  These sellers need to try out the product first.  They apparently do not understand the European vs. American systems.  There is nothing on their packaging that helps to define the region.  It only specifies the 1080 dpi high definition.",1395360000,13,440,4.878378378378378
5000391,1,B006K1IIHA,"What is the point in making a non-USA format DVD when you live in the USA. It was my own stupidity that I bought it, but I felt pretty duped by the person selling this.

5000393,5,B006K1IIHA,"We love Sherlock, and can't stop watching it. The extras alone are worth the price. One of the best shows (actually each episode is almost 2 1/2 hrs long, so more like mini movies) on TV today.",1393977600,,193,4.243243243243243

5000395,1,B006K1IIHA,"Seller states that it works best using a 1080/50i playback. They don't state that this is required for the Blu-Ray discs to be viewed. I have three Sony Blu-Ray compatible devices and none of them will play this disc. The restocking fee quoted was $20, 40% of the cost of the product, not including shipping costs.

5000397,3,B006K1IIHA,Great movie...great acting....annoying technology.  The music on the DVD works just great...but the speaking parts literally come out as a whisper...causing you to turn volume up maximum on the television...which turns into most annoying when the music comes back on!,1391299200,,267,5.675
5000398,1,B006K1IIHA,This DVD did not work on my American DVD player; silly me.  Why would a DVD sold via an American company to an American resident do that??  A waste of my time.,1389657600,,159,3.9375

5000400,5,B006K1IIHA,"This is another caveat about the technical specs of this collection. My experience is the same as other reviewers who found that some North American machines can in fact play it. My Samsung unit is listed as Region A, so it is not region-free, but I have no problems with viewing the discs. I have not tried it on any other make of player.

I would suggest that if you're not positive whether your machine can play these, don't get this set. It was given to me as a gift so I got very happily lucky. Unfortunately the separate seasons are more expensive, but that doesn't mean much if you can't watch the show!

As far as the show itself, it's simply one of the top five TV shows I've ever seen, but others have written more eloquent and helpful reviews to that effect. :-)",1388534400,8,773,4.324137931034483
5000401,1,B006K1IIHA,"Read several comments that this blu-ray would play on a ps3 in the US.  But sadly no, had to return it.  Review has nothing to do with the show.  I am a big fan of BBC's Sherlock.",1388275200,,179,3.7837837837837838

5000405,5,B006K1IIHA,"If your an English Mystery fan as I am you'll love the modern setting of Arthur Conan Doyles stories of the detective Sherlock Holmes. If you think the Victorian era of detective stories may be getting a little long in the tooth then ""Sherlock"" may be the series for you. All of the stories from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles novels have been redone in this modern rendering of his stories which will not disappoint.",1383436800,,410,4.554054054054054
5000406,4,B006K1IIHA,"I wish that it had said in the description that it was region locked, which isn't a real major problem, since I can still watch on my laptop, and I still got this for the same amount as a single season DVD here in America. But I am a bit bummed that I can't watch it on my DVD or Blu-ray players.

5000407,2,B006K1IIHA,"Sherlock is amazing and everyone should watch it! However, beware purchasing blurays manufactured in the UK because as I found out, even if the bluray and the player are region free, it still might not work.

I have rewatched the episodes many times and am mesmerized and in their world each time. My  favorites are the first and last, those two I've lost count of the repeats.  The Woman (aaaah) is a favorite also. They are on  Netflix right now but won't be forever. Multi-region players are extremely inexpensive, and you get the full story.

5000409,1,B006K1IIHA,"I'm a long-time Amazon customer and Prime member and I am completely baffled by Amazon's terrible product labeling and customer service on this Blu-Ray. I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife, and when we put it in we found that it won't work on our Blu-Ray player, even though there's no region-specific info about this disc in the description and it was bought through Amazon.com, not Amazon.co.uk. What's even better is that I bought it 36 days ago and we just now put it in to watch it to discover that it won't play - and since it's been more than 30 days, Amazon won't give us the option to return this item because it's been more than 30 days, even though it's defective.

Really annoyed at wasting money on this and at Amazon's crummy service for this purchase.",1380326400,6,775,4.457746478873239

Honestly one of the best TV shows I've ever seen, and definitely beats anything on currently.  The acting, writing, creativity and cinematography are absolutely top-notch, and the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are now very sought-after actors is no accident.

5000416,2,B006K1IIHA,Really disappointed and should have read the reviews. I was so looking forward to seeing this but it would not play on my Sony Blu-ray player. Maybe this will be fixed and I'll be able to see the series eventually.,1373587200,2,214,4.375
5000417,5,B006K1IIHA,"I saw the first 10 minutes of the first episode at a friend's house when I stopped in for a visit. I was hooked instantly. As soon as I got home, I looked it up and watched the the rest of the episode. With every episode that followed, I only loved it more. I had already seen Cumberbatch as Khan and Freeman as Bilbo. I was amazed at how well the actors portrayed these characters. From the slightest detail of Sherlock's observations to the emotions of Watson's interactions to the drama and action they mix in perfect quantities, this series has to be one the best I have ever seen. I recommend this show to anyone that appreciates a good mystery, a good detective, or just a dramatic, amusing look into a high-functioning sociopath. Actually, I'm forcibly convincing every one of my friends to see it, and they're getting just as much into it as I am. I thought House was a convincing mystery-solver and Robert Downey Jr was a great genius/maniac. Then I saw this ""modern"" Sherlock and I'll never find someone that can compare again.
As for the hard-product itself, the combination of both seasons onto a single blu-ray set wasn't difficult considering it's little more than two trilogies of movie-length episodes. I was also pleased that they included the special features on the discs. I've found that ""double-features"" often lack the bonuses of a ""single-feature"". The problem is that European products (and therefore BBC) are generally formatted in PAL, whereas the typical United States products are NTSC. I believe this is the ""region-lock"". When I tried to play the disc, my TV showed an error message claiming that there was a resolution issue. There was none; my Magnavox NTSC blu-ray player simply couldn't read the PAL format. I have heard a rumor that Sony is either making their products region-free, or that their players can support either format. Once I get my next paycheck, I'm going to get a Sony blu-ray player to test the theory. In the meantime, I'm keeping the blu-ray, even though I can't play it just yet. I'm still enjoying Sherlock online.",1373068800,,2070,4.768802228412256
