817929,1,6304235887,"I bought this tape, and when I tried to do it I got so frustrated.  I think it's for more intermediate fitness levels, those who know the moves or something.  I have done step aerobics, and love it, it's much easier to follow.  This was really annoying, so much so that I threw it in the trash, only after literally pulling the tape out of the cassette!",1010448000,2,353,4.2388059701492535
817930,5,6304235887,"Since I can only exercise when my daughter takes her nap, the length of this workout is ideal for me.  It's about 5 minutes to warm-up, 20-something-minutes of aerobics, and 5 minutes to cool down.  I sweat every time, but it's not so hard that I don't look forward to exercising with it.  It took me three times of working out with the video until I got most of the moves, but now that I know them all, it still never gets boring.",1004140800,2,431,4.168674698795181
817931,5,6304235887,"My main concern with videos is they can become boring quickly!  I've been doing this video for 10 weeks, about 3 times a week....I don't get bored and I am still sweating during the workout.  Tracy York's enthusiasm and fast paced routine keeps you motivated and ready to come back for more.  Worth the money!",999820800,3,309,4.581818181818182
817932,4,6304235887,"I assume this isn't a beginners workout.  It wasn't that is was too hard, it's just that the instructor assumed I knew all the moves, which I didn't and I had a difficult time keeping up.  I managed to work up a sweat though  and with time and practice I'm sure I'll learn it.  It seems like it can be  alot of fun.",926553600,3,315,3.9365079365079363
7865932,5,6304235887,"I love this workout - it is fun, Tracy York is engaging and energized, the exercisers look like they're having a good time AND a good workout, and the choreography is not terribly hard to learn.  It did take a few tries to get the hang of learning certain moves, but enough of the movements were basic enough to keep me going while I learned how to do the more difficult ones.  Once I got the choreo down, I was able to make the workout harder for myself when I wanted to.

It is not the hardest workout ever, but it is aerobic enough to count, plus I tend to use it more often than a really difficult workout video/DVD since I like it so much - which is better than doing a harder workout less often.

Note: If you have difficulty with the choreo at first, give it a few more times and I think there is a good chance you'll learn it.  And, once you learn it and can do it all the way through, I think you'll have a good workout and a good time like I do!!!  Good luck!!",1285286400,,970,4.0
7865933,5,6304235887,"This workout is a little short (I usually do one of the cardio segments twice to make it longer), but is fun from start to finish. Good cardio workout! Wish I could find this on DVD!",1264550400,,182,4.083333333333333
7865934,5,6304235887,"I've used this tape for twelve years, and it's still my favorite.  While it took a time or two to learn the footsteps, but I'm no professional dancer or workout queen, and I could follow along almost immediately.  The steps are innovative, fun and deliver a great fat-burning and metabolism-boosting workout.  Tracy York is energetic without being obnoxious, and it's great to have an instructor who's in shape and not a twenty-something.  There's a low-impact option for those who want a less-intense workout, too.  I always feel like a million bucks after using this tape, and I really wish it was available in DVD format, too.  None of the newer Crunch tapes really do it for me as much as this one.  I often use this tape in conjunction with the Washboard Abs tape, which is also kick-butt and has a great, motivating instructor who's a fabulous 40-something.  I highly recommend this tape.  Go slow at first, rewind and take the time to learn the steps, and watch your body shape change!",1218672000,,992,4.72093023255814
7865935,4,6304235887,"I liked this video a lot, and it is a wonderful aerobic exercise. Tracy gives you a lot of energy and is very encouraging. I like that there are little segments, so when i'm short on time I'll only do one or two segments. Its great everyone should own it.",1055721600,,255,4.12
7865936,5,6304235887,"I think Tracy York is one of the most underrated choreographers out there.  I started out exercising with the Buns of Steel Platinum series, and her aerobics segments were always the most fun -- especially in Buns and Abs of Steel 2000 for Beginners and Hips and Thighs of Steel (while the last one definitely takes time to learn, it's a blast once you get it!).  This workout definitely takes some time to master, but if you like dancy workouts, its worth learning.  It helped me move up to intermediate workouts.  Plus its short, so I still use it on days when I'm running late, or as a short cardio before doing weights.  Moreover, although I own more than 100 videos, its the one that I consistently return to when I need some motivation or familiarity.  And one comment in response to people who complain about Tracy's failure to slowly explain each step.  If she did, the video would have a fairly short shelf life because you'd be bored with the slowness as soon as you learned the routine.  Most good routines just take a little time and effort to learn; it's that simple.",1052611200,,1080,4.530927835051546
7865937,5,6304235887,It's one of my favorite videos right now! It's just 30 mins. of intense cardio training that you will always find time to do b/c it is so fun!,1019001600,,142,3.9310344827586206
7865938,4,6304235887,"This is a good workout for the intermediate, especially one who doesn't have time for a 45-60 minute cardio workout. The workout depends on fairly challenging choreography, and demands a lot of ability to change leads quickly and master moves like the ""grapevine"" and ""mamba"". This video doesn't spend a lot of time getting you accustomed to moves or choreography; it assumes you are already proficient in this ability and skill.
In fact, in some ways this workout can be VERY frustrating. For one, the camera angle tends to change at the EXACT MOMENT you want to SEE where the instructor's feet are going! All too often, in this very lower-body intensive workout, you see some useless view of someone's upper body--I'm sure it's supposed to be inspriational to see how the instructors are all excited about this workout, but I find it irritatingly useless when it comes to figuring out how the combination's supposed to go!
However, for all this annoyance, it's not a bad workout. It may have to demand a bit more patience to get the choreography down than the Tae-Bo series, for instance, but it's not impossible; it's for those ready to take on a challenge and won't be discouraged if the first time they don't quite master everything!
It's also fairly low-impact--there are some high-impact moves, but these are easily modified and you still get a good workout.
I'm also pleased to find a workout that's easy to squeeze into a less-than-an-hour framework, but the exercise is still is a challenge.",1015372800,9,1501,4.8671875
7865939,2,6304235887,"I bought this video in hopes of getting a easy to follow video that would help me feel good with daily exercise without a lot of hassle. Much to my surprise, this video was extremely frustrating-it was very hard to follow the instructor and anticipate what was about to happen next. Half the time, I stood there watching the video wondering where she was and where it was going.  This  in light of the fact that I am not a novice at aerobics and even a former ballet dancer,I couldn't even keep up.  It bummed me out-and after the third try-I gave up.  A big dissapointment it was. Not to mention that all the hollering during it is extremely annoying.  I tried, but in the mail it goes for a return.",1011657600,8,700,4.312977099236641
7865940,5,6304235887,"Okay to be honest, the first time I used this video I got frustrated about the ""ski"" move.  But after a few practices I got it...and I like it!  This video is incredibly sweat-enhancing.  It is a wonderful buy for anyone who wants to have fun exercising!",1010880000,,254,4.361702127659575
7865941,1,6304235887,"I have purchased the tape in hope that it would be a change from another instructor I normally use. The method in use is of combination of 4 moves (4 repetitions in each loop) so that makes the workout to change all the time fast. Also, I felt that I need a lot of space and then it would not have been easier to keep track of the moves.",1010793600,,337,3.898550724637681
