3800950,5,B001UHNXQU,"Even if you already own the new Cybermen stories, this collection is worth $18 for Earthshock alone, as the standalone Earthshock DVD has been outrageously priced by Amazon 3rd party sellers for some time.",1435017600,4,205,5.0588235294117645
3800951,1,B001UHNXQU,"This set is strictly for Nuwho fans or those looking to get a taste of what the new Doctor Who series has to offer. Long time Doctor Who fans are bound to be extremely disappointed, as this DVD set is extremely light on any classic material. The only classic story included is the four part Fifth Doctor episode Earth Schock. And while this is considered one of the best Cybermen stories,and certainly far superior to any of the NuWho Cybermen stories, it only offers a taste of what the Cybermen are like when done right. If this set offered a more comprehensive balance of new and old I'd say buy it. But as it stands, I can't recommend this set to anyone who is interested in collecting Cybermen stories save those who specifically want the new series stories without having to buy the seasons.",1433548800,9,797,4.541666666666667
3800952,5,B001UHNXQU,"I gotta confess...I bought this collection for the Peter Davidson episodes.  Along with Peter Cushing, they were my favorite Doctor Who's.  I just wish the collection had more of the classic iterations of Cybermen.  I find it ironic that Dr. Who has the Cybermen as  their dire arch nemesis and Star Trek has the Borg.  Both exploring the humanity vs. machine theme.  The new episodes are quite good and have better special effects, however this collection gives you a proper introduction to this particular alien baddie.  The extras give you a good over view of the history and development of the Cybermen.  I'm not even a regular viewer of the series and I love this collection!",1432771200,4,680,4.801724137931035
3800953,3,B001UHNXQU,"I was looking forward to this dvd 2 disk set for the ""All New Bonus Material"" thinking it would be an in-depth documentary of this history of the Cyberman in Doctor Who. What I got was a short, quick review of the Cyberman with Dan Starkey who plays Strax and Nick Briggs who voices the Cybermen and the Daleks. I had hoped to have the names of all of the Cybermen episodes and the Doctors and short explanations of the plots. Then I thought, well at least I have ""Earthshock"", a Doctor Five story that shocked the Whoniverse with its ending. I was saddened to see the quality of the transfer. Grainy is the best word I can think of to describe the quality. I should think I would have had a better viewing experience watching the episode on PBS when it was first run here in the US.

If you're a Whovian and a collector, get this. It's a nice addition to your collection. If you're a videophile, skip it. I think it was worth the $12.88 I paid for it.",1431993600,6,952,4.230769230769231
3800954,4,B001UHNXQU,"Next to the Daleks, the Cybermen, originally created by Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, have become renowned in popular culture as one of the Doctor's most terrifying and recurring foes.  A recurring threat since the classic series' fourth season serial, 'The Tenth Planet', the first Cybermen hailed from Earth's twin planet Mondas, and attempted to make humanity in their cloth-faced image, with William Hartnell's First Doctor ultimately defeating them alongside companions Ben and Polly moments before his first regeneration into Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor.  Subsequent appearances would show an evolving species of changing cybernetic strengths and weaknesses, alongside attempted invasions, all thwarted by the Doctor in his many incarnations up until the classic series' cancellation.  These Mondasian Cybermen were also featured within the BBC/Big Finish Audio-books throughout the years when Paul McGann took the reins as the Doctor's Eighth incarnation, up until the series revival in the early 00's.
When the Doctor Who franchise was revived by Russell T Davies in 2005, it was only a matter of time until the Cybermen were to make a much-anticipated on-screen return.  This ultimately came during David Tennant's tenure as the Tenth Doctor, when an accidental crash-landing on a parallel Earth saw a re-imagining of the Cybermen's origin, when the brilliantly intelligent madman John Lumic attempted to cheat death by creating copyrighted chemicals that would preserve the brain inside a cybernetic metal suit of armour.  These Cybermen from a parallel universe (later called 'Pete's World' after Rose Tyler's father) have been referred to as the Cybus Cybermen by the Whovian community, in order to distinguish them from their Mondasian counterparts from the Classic Series.  Throughout the New Series, the Cybus Cybermen have sporadically returned, both in television and within prose novels/comic form, and they have now been clearly cemented within Doctor Who lore.
'The Cybermen Collection', released on 13th April 2009 and distributed by BBC Worldwide Limited/2 Entertain in the UK for Region 2 territories, contains four episodes that feature the Cybus Cybermen throughout Season 2 of the revived series; beginning with their birth on the parallel Earth of Pete's World to their attempted invasion of the Doctor's universe, following their breaking through the void space between worlds instigated by Torchwood, and the find of a Dalek void-ship that culminates in the breakout of a Cybermen-Dalek war at the heart of London.
Episodes included are:
* 'Rise of the Cybermen' & 'The Age of Steel' - originally broadcast from 13/05/2006 - 20/05/2006 as a two-part story arc that details the birth of the Cybus Cybermen when the Tardis accidentally crash-lands on a parallel Earth where Rose's father is still alive and zeppelins are a common sight across London.  The Doctor joins with rebel-group, The Preachers, to bring down the cyber-threat from within and to thwart the forces of cyber-controller, John Lumic, in his plan to cyber-convert the world.
* 'Army of Ghosts' & 'Doomsday' - another two-part story arc, originally broadcast from 01/07/2006 - 08/07/2006 that wraps up Season 2, with the Doctor and Rose saying a tearful farewell when Torchwood unknowingly brings forth the Cybermen from Pete's World into the Doctor's universe, along with a Dalek void-ship, when trying to harness energy from a spatial rift from within Canary Wharf Tower.
With a total running time of 181 minutes, there is also an option to view with English subtitles for the hard-of-hearing and the ability to run through the menu using Audio Navigation.  Regarding special features, on the first disk, an introduction is provided by Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant, explaining his work on the set and his view of the Cybermen in the New Series.  On the second disk, there is a half-hour featurette called 'Best Cybermen Moments', narrated by Matthew Sweet (somewhat of a Cyberman historian), detailing the evolution of the Cybermen from their Mondasian roots in the Classic Series up to the parallel Cybus variety within the New Series, that are seen in episodes provided in this collection.
All in all, this set provides a glimpse into how the Cyberman concept was revived for a new generation of Doctor Who fans, and even though the episodes have been previously released within the Season 2 box-set, it is handy to have these episodes within their own collected set; maybe more so for the passing fan or for the more hardened collector.  An accompanying sister collection was released a few months later focusing on the revival of the Daleks in the New Series, titled 'Doctor Who: The Dalek Collection', which is also handy to have if you enjoyed this set.  Furthermore, if you want to explore the evolution of the Cyberman concept from its inception to the present day, it may be worth picking up the 'Cyberman' entry within the 'Doctor Who - Monster Collection' series of DVDs released in 2013 for the fiftieth anniversary.  It includes the Second Doctor serial 'The Tomb of the Cybermen' and the first two episodes provided within this collection, 'Rise of the Cybermen/The Age of Steel', in order to explore how much the Cyber designs have changed and evolved over the years.",1405123200,,5286,5.227863046044864

8343826,5,B001UHNXQU,"This is a great set if you are a fan of the Cybermen! I enjoyed this batch of stories better than the Dalek box-set that came out around the same time. However, I like the Cybermen as villains more than I like the Daleks, so take that into account.",1458172800,,248,4.081632653061225
8343827,4,B001UHNXQU,"This is worth buying just for Earthshock. One of the most important classic era stories and a DVD that's gone out of print. Buy it for that the Tennant, Smith, and Capaldi episodes are just bonus.",1448409600,2,196,4.472222222222222

8343831,5,B001UHNXQU,"This DVD is one I usually would not buy. It appears, at first glance, to only contain newer episodes of DW and I already have all the seasons of the show except season 8. However, like it has been mentioned in other reviews, this DVD is solely worth the price simply for the inclusion of Earthshock. The reason? It's going for about $60 from sellers! I am unsure if this was a low print run of the DVD for the US fans but you get a lot more with this collection for the price. Some people complained about the transfer but honestly, it doesn't bother me. I like having that sort of feel to the older episodes. Sometimes updating is needed for these shows but I doubt it does, for my opinion, in Earthshock since it was in the 80s when it aired.

New fan or old, add this to your collection simply to watch Earthshock. It's a defining moment for the 5th Doctor and one can still see the repercussions of that in today's show.",1438732800,3,924,4.25
