4184639,5,B003RHZ66Q,"What I Can Tell You:

If you have a daughter, and you have not seen any of the Barbie Movies you are truly missing out. There is not a single Barbie Movie we haven't seen and I would love to own all of them. The movies are all very well made with great graphics and loads of songs and fun animal friends for Barbie and her friends to pal around with.

My 5 year old isn't big with Barbie dolls but she loves the movies and I love that we can watch them together and I am not bored.

Head over to the Barbie website to play some games and activities associated with the movie as well as a bunch of other Barbie related stuff. We spend hours playing on [...]",1284681600,4,656,3.9923664122137406
4184640,3,B003RHZ66Q,"My 3 year old owns almost all of the Barbie movies.  She did not like this one at all.  It was boring and there was no singing.  Most of the Barbie movies are incredibly corny but they had some catchy songs (e.g. Diamond Castle, Mermaid Tale, Princess and the Pauper, Island Princess, Musketeers).  This movie was just....blah.  That's the only way to describe it.  It was boring and unremarkable.  Save your money and rent it for a night, or buy a better Barbie movie.",1284681600,10,469,4.511904761904762
4184641,2,B003RHZ66Q,"I was not looking forward to this movie, but I was (somewhat) pleasantly surprised, so I'll start with the bright side. The romance of Barbie and Ken was sweet (thought a little ridiculous. This was a big surprise, since lately, the character of Ken is made to look wimpy or altogether non-existent (although he's equally idiotic in this movie). The theme ""believe in yourself"" was a bit overdone, but it was still inspiring for little girls. ""Never give up"" would have been a better motto.
The inclusion of more friends from Barbie's history...such as Grace, from the So In Style girls and Raquelle was a good twist. Barbie is portrayed as an imaginative, sweet, encouraging girl. The references to Barbie's past movies were a very nice addition, as were the evidences of her past movies and life as a real person. The speacial features were very good and included the dance video and music video from Mermaid Tale. I wish they had included the ""Get your sparkle on"", which can be viewed on youtube or fanpop. The music they used was good-particularly the music for the fashion show. Oh, and they used a rendition of ""Who let the dogs out"" and it was positively hilarious. The barrage of gallons and gallons of pink sparkles was a bit much, but that's a minor complaint.
Perhaps the best part was (SPOILER) when Jaqueline apologized--and was forgiven. Now THAT was very refreshing. So much of the time we're told ""People never change! Get back at them because YOU rock!"" and it was a wonderful change.
My biggest problem was most likely the slightly more sexual theme. Yes, it sounds crazy, but it's hinted at. Jaques, the pet of Aunt Millie, is enthralled by Sequin, Barbie's poodle. He watches her, gazing with his mouth open and tongue hanging out, and then he swivels around her and says ""You are my muse, my inspiration! Let me dress you, my dear."" winking and smirking all the while. In the outtakes Jacques swaggers up to a statue (remember, he's a dog) which he mistakes for Sequin. He strokes the statue's paw. ""Ooh, my dear, you look so cold. Let Jacques...warm you up,"" he growls suggestively. Later when Ken rips his pants, the camera zooms in on his backside to see his red-heart underwear...more than once. MANY outfits reveal far too much leg and cleavage.
Then we come to the ""magical"" side. The flairies are some sort of ancient wizardry (although they look like immodest seven-year-olds with impossibly long legs, stilettos and cute figures) that are ""called"" or ""awakened"" by a special ""chant"". Once again, Teresa is obsessed with the extra-terestrial and/or paranormal. She reads alien magazines, and she believes Ken has been possesed by alien spirits. She yanks on his ear and orders them out of his mind. I'm sick of seeing Teresa (who is my favorite of Barbie's friends) being portrayed as either a new-age obsessive freak or just plain ditzy.

So if it weren't for the slight innuendos and magic dabbling, this movie would get three stars from me. It still doesn't compare with the Island Princess, Nutcracker, Princess and the Pauper, or any of the other previous princess movies. The animation, to say the least, is somewhat lacking. It has none of the charm or elegance we've come to expect. It's a tiny bit more realistic and the scenes of Paris are pretty good, but the faces are fake and plastic-looking. The music was fabulous, but just not right for a Barbie movie. I miss Arnie Roth's beautiful songs more and more. This movie shows the downfall of Barbie movies, and it made me wince more than a few times. It's just not as fabulous as its predecessors. An improvement over Mermaid Tale, but that's about it. I hated the fact that Kelly Sheridan wasn't the voice-over. For the first time in Barbie movie history, Kelly wasn't even in the cast. Just another first...the marking of Barbie going down the drain. And while the theme may have been ""Stay true to your passion"" but the movie shows two very different ideas: ""If it's not 'In Style' then it's not worth spitting on"" and ""No matter how immodest or just plain freaky, if the fashion critics like it, it's going to the top.""
Skip this one and go with one of the more classic Barbie movies. While your little girl will probably love it, older Barbie fans may not be so thrilled.",1284595200,7,4268,4.713520749665328
4184642,1,B003RHZ66Q,"This is the worst Barbie movie ever! I have bought all the movies for my now 4 year old daughter. We are big Barbie Fans and have enjoyed the past movies. However,this one is just so bad in so many ways. The content is very adult and not meant for young children. It deals with adult issues with heavy burdens. Ex: Getting fired, breakups, Closing business, hateful people who want nothing but to see you suffer and get hurt.
 It all starts off very badly from the beginning scene where Barbie is filming the classic 'The Princess and the Pea' and it turns into a horror movie, per this very obnoxious, hateful yelling director. He fires Barbie in the worst way possible. Then she gets hate mail on her computer as well as her boyfriend Ken dumping her over the phone. Yeah, but don't hold your breath yet. It gets even worse as the story progresses.
I could not even watch it through the first 20 mins. The characters are so unintelligent. Theresa is just so dumb. Who says stuff like she does anyway? Aliens... Really? Come on even my 4 year old is brighter than her. The Dippy Aunt Millicent is just too unbelievable trying to find herself at her age. The Catty and unethical Jaquline is something I hope my daughter never tries to imitate as well as Delphine, a mindless twit who lets Jaquline boss her around disrespectfully and control her every move. Even the pets act up in this one with meaness, cattiness and just plain hateful behavior. The kid on the plane with Ken who is just over the top bad is just unappealing in so many ways. I found it difficult to watch this movie and felt embarrassed by the fictional characters behaving so badly. Stealing, lying, cheating and disrespect are not things I want to instill in my child. Do yourself a favor and skip this one if you are a Barbie fan and enjoyed the ones in the past. I wish I had!",1284595200,108,1849,4.422287390029325
4184643,4,B003RHZ66Q,"This is not my favorite Barbie movie, but I am guessing that I am not the target audiance for Barbie movies.  My daughter, who is not yet five LOVED the movie.  We watched it together and at the end she was singing with the credits.  The theme of the movie is very appropriate - to believe in yourself.  The movie was slightly more complicated than most Barbie plots, there were three stories running simultaneously.  The graphics were excellent, as usual and the music was catchy.  Although I think Barbie and a mermaid tale and the barbie christmas carol movies are better, my daughter enjoyed this one much more.",1284595200,2,615,4.648148148148148
4184644,4,B003RHZ66Q,"Barbie seems to be in college here...I am not sure.  This is the first movie I have seen Ken in.  His character is a bit more endearing than the personality that the world has attached to the poor Ken doll.  As usual, Barbie is independent and solves her own problems which is why I allow Barbie into my house.  She is, as in other movies, a self-thinker and go getter.  The story line is pretty good, the ""acting"" is pretty good too.  The music is tolerable and I actually have caught myself humming some of the tunes.  The only thing I was not crazy about was that it seems like there could have been a bit more to it.  More depth?  My 7 yr old daughter loved it, and she got the message that was trying to be put out there; so it served its purpose.  If you are new to Barbie movies, as much as I loathed the idea of this stage in my daughter' s life, I have come to appreciate the messages that the movies convey, compared to most of the Disney movies which seem to always have to have some male rescue the princess.  These are very refreshing.",1284508800,,1048,4.138613861386139

4184703,5,B003RHZ66Q,"I think this is the funniest Barbie movie I've seen!  Every scene with Ken...I couldn't stop laughing.  It reminded me of the movie ""Just My Luck""!

The funny Ken scenes aside, this movie overall was very entertaining.  I am twenty years old, and I've watched all the Barbie movies since I was a child.  I saw this one with my eleven year old sister, and we both loved it.  She requested that I buy the DVD (sadly, there is no Blu-ray), immediately, and I most certainly will.

Some of the things this movie had going for it was catchy, likable pop songs, funny comedic relief, and an actual plot about Barbie helping her aunt save her store.  Sprinkle in a little magic, harmless drama, and talking pets, and viola!  Awesomeness.

I do wish the CGI was better, but this IS a kids' movie after all, not to mention a direct-to-DVD release, so I can't complain too much.

Though I am shocked at some of the negative reviews on here!  Well, if you're looking for a ""classic"" fairytale Barbie movie like ""Rapunzel"" or ""Swan Lake"", you may not like this one.  (It seems like Disney is trying to get away from the ""fairytale"" stories as well.  Interesting, huh?)  It has a different feel to it, as the newer Barbie films do.  It seems they are targeting girls ages 9-13, as the older movies seemed to be aimed at the age range of 2-8 years old.  Personally, I think it's great the movies are evolving.  Change is good.  There are 30+ Barbie movies out there, a little variety here and there won't hurt.

Regardless of what anybody else thinks, I liked this movie.  And Barbie fans, if you enjoyed ""Barbie Diaries"" and ""A Fairy Secret"" chances are good you'll like this one too :)",1441152000,,1673,4.473509933774834

For the parents:  It has a good storyline and delivers the following messages: girl power, family bonds, helping friends, working hard wins over drama, romance can be won, but is not the priority, cheaters fail, and forgiveness.  I would have preferred Ken's character to be smarter and foiled only by a greater obstacle.  Girl power does not have to come by the dumbing down of the boy power.  Plus, my son was watching too.  I want him to watch that boys are smart too.

To think that this movie is going to effect their self esteem is ludicrous.  It is a fun take on the real world.  Many children have had to deal with a family member losing a job and this is a magical way to escape from the harsh reality of every day life.  I did not notice that Barbie was scantily clad or had on too short of a skirt.  If I go to the local Wal-Mart, I will see real people dressed much worse than anything I saw in this movie.  This movie is NOT about getting the latest fashions or dorkish male figures.  It is about a young woman getting her bearings back after having her feet knocked out from under her.  After helping her aunt (which reminds me of one of my own) get her own confidence back, Barbie seems to feel proud of her accomplishments and has regained her own confidence.  If seen from this perspective, the movie is very empowering for young girls.  It shows them that helping others can help yourself.",1370563200,,1062,4.212871287128713

4184833,3,B003RHZ66Q,"I think the producers of this latest Barbie movie were not too sure about the target age group because in this story, a recently broken-up Barbie (from Ken) is shown leaving for Paris with her dog Sequin to visit her aunt Millicent. The boy-girl relationship plot seemed a bit inappropriate in a movie where the target age group is probably under 9. Throughout the movie, Ken is shown trying in vain to get to Barbie to apologize and get back with her but faces lots of silly obstacles along the way. Oh, and there's a kissing scene between Ken and Barbie in here.

Then there's the plotline featuring the flairies - three glammed-up little fashionistas who play roles similar to the elves in the story of the Elves and the Shoemaker. These three flairies (they have flair but are not fairies since they do not possess wings) give budding fashion designers a much-needed boost with their 'flair' for designing clothes. I confess that I had problems with this part too - unlike other Barbie stories, the flairies plot line just did not seem as engaging as other stories like Barbie in the Mermaid Tale etc. Instead of portraying the need for trusting one's instincts and talent, the role of the flairies seemed to suggest that extra help by means of magical means was the way to go, and even though the storyline moved towards its ultimate 'trust your talent' message, I felt it was a bit too late for that.

I felt letdown by this latest flick in the Barbie series of animated features - a shallow plot, and too much focus on romance detracted from any positive messages the movie wanted to convey.",1343779200,2,1598,4.623239436619718

This movie was created to sell one of Mattel's yearly Barbie doll series released just before the Christmas holidays( a tradition for a decade now). The movie is obviously not Oscar material, but most of the negative comments I have read have been abouts its content. There is nothing ""adult"" or disgusting or shallow about this movie. The story is cute, sweet, and will not warp a young child's brain. It has Elise Allen's distinct style of writing which is charming and funny. Most of the bad comments have been left by helicopter Moms who probably support ""never say die"" in children's material(quickly eliminating such obvious R-rated debauchery as ""Bambi"" and ""The Princess and the Frog""). I grew up with writers like Roald Dahl and Judy Blume, and movies like ""The Last Unicorn"". They did not destroy my character: They actually made it fuller. The content in ""A Fashion Fairytale"" is way more G-rated than even those works. Don't listen to women who look at innocent films like this one to find evil.

My eight yr old and I watched it together and thoroughly enjoyed it. It showed Barbie in a whole new light, as the ""actress"" behind all of those other ""fairy tale"" characters, but also as a real girl/young woman with dreams (and a real boyfriend) and who encourages all of us to follow our dreams, whatever they are! As soon as the movie was over, my daughter went to work sketching clothing designs of her own and covered the walls with her unique style and creativity! Why not allow Barbie to be seen like this in a movie, for years, the doll has been portrayed as everything from vet to fashion designer and everyone from Scarlett Ohara to Dana Scully...as far as Ken being portrayed as a bit of a clumsy guy as he made his way to Barbie across the country, but he was also funny and kind. This movie gave him more depth than of ""real"" characteristics than ever before. As far as the male dog designer character being a chauvinist. Yes, by definition, he did have an exaggerated, bellicose patriotism and a belief in his national superiority and glory - as did all of the Parisians, that is where the term comes from, after all.",1325203200,3,1270,4.450643776824034

I see that at least the recommended age for it is 7 and up, but my husband and I think is too mature for any girl who is young enough to play with Barbie dolls.
Those first 3 reviews all give accurate synopsis' of what happens in this dreadful movie, so I am just reviewing to add my one star rating.  Since I had to give it that one star, let's say that star is for the movie's song ""life is a fairytale"" which is catchy and can be taken as a song to encourage empowerment if you just listen to the lyrics w/o watching the movie.
Keep your little daughters young and sweet, and try ""Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses"" instead.",1324598400,2,789,4.295302013422819
4184844,1,B003RHZ66Q,"What a disappointment! Now they have replaced Kelly Sheridan, all Barbie is about now is glitter, fashion, boyfriends and all that junk. Also, they are into modern technology with iphones and stuff like that.

I was so upset watching this film as I have grown up with the original stories which completely touched me, the girls were ROLE MODELS and believed in themselves, it was never about how they looked or what they had on. Nor did they worry about guy's breaking up with them, catty and nasty girls or anything like that. Whenever they had enemies in the stories I knowed and loved it was never over-done and they weren't being evil because of boyfriends, guys or just superficial junk.

This was NOT a fairytale, which was misleading. It's not like Swan Lake or Rapunzel which are REAL fairytales, this is completely PLASTIC, SHALLOW and materialistic.

The graphics were completely overdone as well. Especially the catwalk scene with all that glitter being thrown all over the dress. The whole 'glitter' theme throughout the movie was overdone. Overall I found the graphics too much. Also, the whole 'break-up' thing with Barbie and Ken was really inappropriate for a childrens film.

None of the characters were likable AT ALL. And what was with the whole 'fashion fairies' 'flaries' idea?! What a disgrace! The real fairies I want to see are like Elena in Fairytopia, a kind, brave and inspirational girl, not ones that dress up clothes and have annoying voices and toss glitter on clothes!
They even tried to toss Ken in with all the glitter and fashion garbage with dressing him up on the catwalk. And what was with that kiss?! Bit too much for a kids film! They never had quite passionate kisses in the Barbie films I grew up with.

I was also very angry they decided to say that the 'Barbie' in this film was an 'actress'. which made it very 'Hollywood'. The scene where she is acting is also ridiculous and not funny at all. My Mum and my whole family cringed at how stupid that scene was. Also, they decided to say that this 'Barbie' acted in 'A Mermaid Tale' and all the other Barbie films. Which really infuriated me as it really ruined the magic of the other films.

I'm very sad and angry at Mattel at the new road they are taking for Barbie, which is a materialistic Barbie with a new appearance, new voice and just obsessed with the stuff that doesn't REALLY matter.

If I ever have kids, I'm never letting them see this. They will be seeing the real stories which I grew up with and loved and still do. The girls with spirit and love and the 'natural' graphics.

I don't think young girls should be seeing this personally. If your girl is into the modern world, not the stuff pre-2008, then let them see this. But if you are like me and an adult who grew up with 'Rapunzel' 'Swan Lake' and the other stories, you won't like this and be very disappointed with the new road Mattel are taking.

I don't know why they are making Barbie like this?! I can tolerate the new Barbie look and voice (I still miss Kelly Sheridan terribly) if they make the stories have good morals and tone down the graphics and have stuff that isn't to do with glitter and fashion. Even if isn't like 'Swan Lake' or have ballet themes, just something like the Island Princess or Fairytopia.

I'll have to admit that it was so much fun for me because Barbie has an Aunt in this movie who is a fashion designer named Millicent. That was quite a coincidence, because I had an aunt Millicent who actually was a successful fashion designer, and she did a lot to encourage my creativity back in the day.

Of course, I'm a long-time Barbie fan. Because we have kids in our circle who are just becoming the age for Barbie, I have to admit that I've discovered her films only recently, and I love every one!",1321401600,,646,4.428571428571429
4184846,5,B003RHZ66Q,"Ok, I like all the Barbie Movies, but this one is special, absolutely my favorite! it's exciting and extremely well paced and plotted.  It draws on the roots of Barbie - STYLE!  Upbeat, and with strong characters.  The Zombie Peas are a blast, but so is the use of puns, visual jokes, and beautifully handled dialog.  It delivers a message of strength and hope, with themes of the power of friendship and love, perseverance in  the face of seemingly impossible obstacles (Ken's labor of love trying to get to France becomes The Odyssey with Belly laughs)
 It's a delight!  I think most of the negative reviews I've seen are generated by the expectation that Barbie Cartoons be limited to the kindergarten level.  Here's one that made me want to pull out my Barbies and do my own Fashion Show. and definitely resonated, speaking both to my inner child, and my outer adult.

Secondly the charater designs changed, I feel Barbie's eyes are a little too far apart and the shape is odd. I thought the opening was strange and a little creepy. The whole ""break up"" with Ken was an over used thing we've seen a dozen times. I felt the whole plot of the movie was very weak. However I did like the charater Marie Alice.

I have to agree with the other reviews, it did seem grown up for kids and Ken was just plan silly. Also how did the dogs and cat learn to sew? I think the title is misleading a bit, it wasn't really a fairy tale at all. Rather that was what they called the fashion show.

It seems to lack what the older Barbie movies had, a good plot, fairly good dialoge, a good story line, and they leave you with a good feeling. This one did not. I've seen little girls in the store tell their Mom's they didn't want this movie because Barbie changed.

I found Baribe A Fairy Secert to be annoying with an ending that is way over used. Will Barbie Princess Charm School be any better? I wish they'd go back to how the older movies used to be.

The references to twitter, facebook, and such will be horribly dated at some point, where the other movies will remain timeless.

That said, I must also acknowledge that this movie inspired my (almost) 8 year old more than any barbie movie so far. She has always had a very unique, artistic sense of style and feels frustrated with the cookie-cutter fashions that are affordable. She hates seeing 10 other girls wearing the same target outfit. She prefers to only wear dresses or skirts, and likes imaginative patterns and (of course) glitter. She loved the idea that fashion design is actually a career, and the DVD extras included an interview with a real fashion designer that works on Barbie.

That was it for her! She spent the next 4 hours furiously drawing every dress design she has ever imagined, and then begged me to teach her how to make them ""for real"". Next think I know she is signed up for sewing lessons, cutting out fabric scraps to make dresses for her barbie, and anxiously awaiting the chance to make her own clothing.

So, horrible movie? Yes! But... if you have an artistic little girl at home, she might ignore all the trendy-teen-drama nonsense and be inspired by the art of making clothing!",1307664000,3,1392,4.864978902953586

The Barbie movies have now truly turned into the anorexia/low self esteem inducing movies that everyone thought they would be before ever seeing one.

I just came on to check the reviews for the newer movie before buying it, because after Fashion there is no way I was going to buy it without looking into it first.  Now I'm not going to buy it for her after reading the reviews.  Sounds like it's even worse than this one.  Barbie has lost a customer.

Great to see the Barbie films a little more modern and hip but still tasteful (apart from slight cattiness of female characters in places). Fun characters and great to see Ken in the movie too. He was great. Especially loved the balance of male and female voices and the fact the female voices weren't overly high pitched like some of the Barbie movies (which can get very grating to listen to). Also no irritating characters (no offence, but Bibble wasn't one of our favourites). Great humour, great music and a feel good vibe.

Barbie competes against Dreamworks and Pixar animation. For the most part, Barbie seems to be doing really well. Not this time. The story was dry, the acting lacked passion and the animation left a lot to be desired. The antagonists have a change of heart with no real obstacles or life lessons. The protagonists succeed with very little heartache or realistic hope of success. And Ken now represents every other baby-bop boy-band with no real substance.
This one is a total disappointment. I'd like to see a movie establishing depth in a relationship with Barbie and Ken if Mattel really wants to start addressing ""real-life issues"" and encouraging our children to grow up before they're ready. I'd rather have the fairytales and bed-time stories that help our children tap into their imaginations and encourage them to dream. However, I do appreciate the vignettes in the special features or more fun section of the DVDs that show real people doing real-life activities - painting, dancing, designing.

NOT in this movie.  Where did she go?  I hate the voice of Barbie in this one.  It's not Barbie at all.  I even looked up Ms. Sheridan on Internet Movie Database.  As of November 25, 2010, she is not credited for any further Barbie projects, though there is a movie projected for release in Spring 2011, second:  the subject matter is way too mature for the age range of this series.  Children that watch Barbie, in my opinion, do not need to watch mess with boyfriends and cheating.  That's a little mature for them.

But when you stop to compare it to the other Barbie movies even, A Mermaid's tale (one of the weakest up to this point) this one just doesn't measure up.  I found it boring at points, and wasn't too impressed with it.  Has Mattel ran out of ideas for Barbie movies, here are some suggestions:

The Princess and The Pea: Instead of using it as a parody in a movie like this actually make the fairy tale.

Cinderella:  Hey everyone else has done it isn't it time Barbie took on the role

Sleeping Beauty:  Once again done in many mediums and would like to see Barbie tackle it.

The Little Mermaid:  Instead of Mermaidia or whatever, take the actual story on.

Beauty and The Beast:  Also done countless times, but would like to see how it would be interpreted in a Barbie film.

Little Women:  A timeless story, and would love to see Barbie take on the role of Jo.

These are just some ideas, and there are sure many others.  Also, I know that the writers of these movies can come up with better ideas then a fashion fairy tale, they prove it with Island Princess and The Crystal Castle, that were original stories.

4184926,2,B003RHZ66Q,"My 5 year old LOVED this movie (hence the 2.5 star rating - 5 stars for her, 0 for me... divided in half).  But after seeing it over and over, and listening to the stale dialogue (and those ever annoying 'Flairies') it is beyond clear that this dvd is simply a marketing tool.  Of course it is, you're saying to yourself.  But, marketing the Fashion Fairytale line of Barbie dolls and putting Ken in ridiculous situations is ALL this 80-minute movie does.

There is no real point to the storyline.  Barbie's screenwriters would have been smart to take a queue from the classic 50s and 60s drab-to-fab and Paris movies (ie: like Sabrina).  Past Barbie dvds might not have been great, but at least they attempted some substance - they provided enough of a story to allow the child-viewing-audience to continue that story with their dolls and other merchandise.  But not only is this movie painful to watch, but the toys in this line aren't all that great either!!

Also leaving a sour note is the horrible animation.  In contrast to the classic doll looks that have been featured in past dvd movies, Barbie and her friends now look like they went through a number of botched plastic surgeries with big heads and bug-eyes. Hello, this is supposed to be Barbie! Not Bratz, or Moxie Girls, or Monster High, or any of those oddly proportioned ""older girl"" dolls.  The dolls' colorful renderings were also oddly in high contrast to the dark backgrounds (I mean, even daytime in Paris was shown as darker than it really is).  What was with that?  Did this movie just get green-lit so it could make it to store shelves and warehouses for the end-of the-year holiday season?  I'll just answer myself here, YES.

Maybe I'm just traditional, maybe I'm just partial to the re-telling of (actual) fairy tales and classic stories with a Barbie twist, but 'A Fashion Fairytale' was NOT for me.  Heck, even ""Barbie in a Mermaid Tale"" was MUCH more enjoyable than this piece.

I have seen all of the Barbie movies and I really like that the stories are independent and can stand on their own, and they do not include things to try to appeal to more people. One thing I wasn't a big fan of that happened in this movie is that it tried to appeal to more people by plugging in popular things (like twitter, iPhones, tabloids, using the word ""haters"").

A movie + popular topics (twitter, haters) = a better movie? I don't think so

 I think all the stories were good on there own as to where they did not have to include things like that. Also the whole relationship between Barbie and Ken seemed to go a little to fast, already saying ""I love you at the end of the movie"". I things like that can get engrained into the minds of kids and effect their future relationships. I have read other comments and some have said that the topics were too mature but I am not sure what the dominant age group is for these movies (I am 18 years old). Also, some of the things that may be considered ""mature"" in this movie is the same kind of content in shows like iCarly and Hannah Montana (shows that are for kids).

Whoever wrote it failed to think about it from the point of view of a little kid. The plot reads like a Gossip Girl episode (in the first few minutes, Barbie, a high school student, gets fired from her starring role in a Hollywood movie, gets trashed on a Perez Hiltonesque website, gets dumped by her boyfriend Ken over the phone, which turns out to be an evil plot hatched by some other girl, and then she goes to France to visit her fashion designer aunt...) really, what 5 year old is going to understand any of this? What was the writer thinking? What age group was she aiming for??

Many scenes are spent with adults standing around talking in accents, it's a waste of time. Maybe the kids will stare at the colors on the screen but compared to all the other Barbie movies which are actually age-appropriate and engaging, this one is a dud.

(Forget the kids, as an adult who loves&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gossip-Girl/dp/B002JVWRBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gossip Girl</a>&nbsp;and fashion even I'm not having any fun watching this.)

I'll leave on a positive note. The 'flairies' are very pretty and cute but enter the movie way too late, have a very small amount of screen time and aren't utilized enough. The script should have been rewritten from their pov, it would have been much more fun.

I purchased this as a gift for them for Sweetest Day and we watched it; as soon as Barbie opened up her mouth we were filled with disappointment.  They replaced their long standing voice-over Kelly Sheridan with someone else...which is a terrible mistake. If they don't think little kids notice that they are surely mistaken.
The new voice just didn't match Barbie's personality; its very harsh and kind of airhead like, almost whiney.  If you are not familiar with the other Barbie movies, it probably wouldn't bother you, but after 18 other movies were it was refreshing for BArbie to always have the same voice, it was annoying to say the least.

 Another problem I had with the movie...Barbie played herself..not a character like all the other movies, this was very confusing to my daugher as well; as she feels each character is a real person.  They brought back many of the ""villians"" from previous movies (Mermaide Tale and Island Princess) to play different characters in this new movie. They had small pointless roles, however, it was much noticed by my 5 year old. ""Mommy, why is the bad lady from island princess in this movie?? I don't understand!"" Would it really have been that hard to just draw new characters? Little children remember villians, at least if they were going to do this, they could have brought back the good characters!

 It was also the first time we saw Barbie and Ken kiss, and it was more than once. That didn't bother me so much, but I felt it was unnecessary. It is like they are trying to make Barbie for tweens and teens and I'm sorry, but no 13-18 yr old I know sits around and watches Barbie. Its the younger girls, and I""m sorry but the younger girls liked BArbie's old voice and Princess/Fantasy fairytales. We can watch Fashion movies anywhere these days.  On a good note, we did love the music, there are 2 songs that are quite catchy we find ourselves singing constantly (Get your Sparkle On, and Life is a Fairytale).

Overall, I think Mattel miss the boat on this one; while my children still loved Barbie; I felt the content was a little too old for the audience that will watch it; adult themes like lossing a job and her boyfriend breaking up with her.
I hope they go back to their original writing style for the new movie this spring, A Fairy Secret, or I'm not so sure I will continue to buy these movies and have to explain them to my children.",1287446400,5,2494,4.522222222222222

I always enjoy the music and storylines of the movies, and I was looking forward to seeing the future Barbie movies.  However, if they are anything like Barbie a Fashion Fairytale, I may have to quit my Barbie addiction.  This movie was pretty terrible.  What have they done to her face?  Instead of the fair, very pretty,  normal Barbie face, they have made her a mousy looking, pointy faced, bug eyed girl.  What were they thinking?  Why would they change something that was good to begin with?  Another terrible change to Barbie was her voice.  What happened to Kelly Sheridan?  She was a fantastic person to voice the character of Barbie.  In 99% of the other Barbie movies, she sings.  However, in this movie, she never sings a song.  Kelly Sheridan had such a pretty voice.  It's a real loss to the Barbie series to lose her.  What a disappointment.  Barbie in this movie doesn't really do anything either.  The story begins when Barbie on on the set of the Princess and the Pea.  She gets fired from the movie, sees all of the hateful reviews on the internet about her, and gets dumped by Ken.  She then decides to get away and go to Paris to visit her Aunt Millicent.  She gets there and her Aunt's fashion designing buisiness is shutting down.  Attempting to save her Aunt's buisiness, Barbie teams up with a young designer named Maire Alicia to create a fashion line within a day.  During this whole time, Barbie pretty much watches as Alicia does everything...  Barbie doesn't design, or do anything.  She's pretty much a cheerleader, cheering on Alicia to do all the work.  They also discover magical fashion ""flairies.""  This is totally irrevelant to the whole new ""modern"" Barbie theme.  It also completely controversal the theme to ""believe in yourself,"" when Alicia completely depends on the flairies to finish her designs, otherwise they wouldn't be any good.  All in all, this movie was pretty bad.  The characters were dumb and predictable, there was a lack of storyline, and the changes were terrible.  This movie scraped 2 stars from me because of my sheer love for the Barbie movies.",1287273600,5,2225,4.713541666666667

Not sure we'll be doing that now after watching this movie.  Why did they change the Barbie movies, when they were so good before?  In this one, Barbie looks really weird, her voice is different (no more Kelly Sheridan), and the magic is gone.  The previews for the next Barbie movie do not look good either (for Spring 2011).

4184983,2,B003RHZ66Q,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt because of all the hype built up for it and the cover art is gorgeous.  I thought the idea of fashion design would be a fun plot, especially since my daughters love to dress up.  In fact, I was even planning to build the theme of my daughter's next birthday around a Barbie Fashion show theme.  Still want to do that, but, here's my take on the film:

1. I really thought the animation was improving right up to the Mermaid Tale movie.  It was really getting fantastic.  This being the latest film, I expected the animation to actually have improved.  It looks worse!  In fact, I felt like the characters moved like bad video game characters.  The only difference being that the detail and rendering is better.  But, the animation was very stiff.

2. I HATE Barbie's new face!  What is up with the abnormally large eyes, big head and tiny mouth?  She looks like an alien with make-up, blond hair and blue eyes!  Bring the old Barbie look back, please.  That Barbie was gorgeous and looked more like the dolls.

3. I agree with others who have said the storyline was very shallow.  I wanted to add, too, that the characters are exaggerrated to the point that it wasn't even comical.  The little boy in the airplane was annoying.  He appeared to be 6 years old but behaved like a toddler (in reference to bursting into tears when Ken made a face back at him).  The zombie peas were ridiculous (I know, that was the point), and I didn't feel the need to see them anymore beyond the first scene.  As for the guy in the hotdog suit toward the end.  Ugh, need I say more?

If I loved anything about the movie, it was the ""flairies"", they were adorable and I loved the acting and animation for them.  It just seems like they didn't do much more than glitterize all of the clothing.  Hello, that is WHY you don't ""see anything like that"", because not everyone wants to wear glitter-tastic party dresses!  Although the third fairy who found her talent toward the end, I liked that.  That was a nice touch.

I do have to say that I also really like the music.  Can't wait till the soundtrack is available because I would love to play it at my daughter's birthday party.  I will say, she did love the movie.  But, she loves Barbie and she REALLY loves sparkles and pink, so that kind of bought her bigtime.

I'm just disappointed in this Barbie film.  We have all of the others.  I wish it was just another one where Barbie is at the beginning and ending of the film, telling a story to a youngster that teaches them a good life lesson. Barbie used to be about believing in yourself and girl power and just being a good a likeable person.  Not about boy drama or what the latest styles and trends are.  Girls have enough of that surrounding their everyday lives.  Come on, Mattel, fix this before you lose a lot of adoring fans.",1287187200,11,2889,4.350844277673546

It was hard to explain to my daughter why characters in this movie looked like characters from other Barbie movies. Much prefer when Barbie sat down to tell a story and that is how the movie would come to be. And why do they always have to make one of Barbie's friends a goof? My daughter loves these movies, but I think I really need to rethink allowing her to watch them (and me purchasing them for her).

4184990,5,B003RHZ66Q,"Negative reviewers really need to lighten up! My family has the entire collection of Barbie movies and this is another fun, light-hearted installment perfectly in step with the rest of the series. Some people have complained about 'mature themes' better suited for older viewers (getting fired, being dumped over the phone, etc.), but keep in mind that such themes are not likely to strike a personal chord with younger audiences, and older viewers will find that these themes are presented in a comical manner anyway. (It helps to actually watch the whole movie rather than flick it off after five minutes and rush to write a negative review). The inclusion of Ken (a first in the Barbie movies) as a completely innocent jerk who can't seem to get a break makes for an amusing sub-plot to Barbie's adventures in Paris. And portraying Barbie's own 'real' life as an actress (rather than a character in a fictionalized adventure she's appearing in) puts an interesting new twist on the series.
  My initial concerns, before buying some of the more recent Barbie titles, have been the direction the series appeared to be taking toward a 'modern' perspective. Namely, the increasing infection of pop music, which has a worldly sound and is sometimes incongruous with Barbie's settings (as in Diamond Castle and Three Musketeers), and gender-reversal issues, or 'girl-power' which is really just throwing a bone to the grown-ups while brainwashing kids into following the 'PC' crowd and NOT thinking for themselves. But I'm happy to say that none of the Barbie movies so far have ever beaten anyone over the head with these 'issues', and all have maintained a thoroughly fun atmosphere. A Fashion Fairy Tale is another delightful, entertaining Barbie movie that I highly recommend for the whole family.",1285545600,7,1798,5.05050505050505

4185014,3,B003RHZ66Q,"I pre-ordered this item so there weren't any reviews.  After the DVD shipped, I look at the reviews and I was concerned about the DVD.  Many of the reviews are spot-on, but it's not a terrible DVD.  It depends on your perspective.

Yes, some of these concepts might be a little harsh for a young child.  In the first few minutes,Barbie deals with a hateful director, gets fired, finds herself trashed online, and her perpetual boyfriend, Ken, calls her to break up.  Barbie is upset and heads to Paris.

1.  Many parents like Barbie over the Disney Princesses because ""she solves her own problems and doesn't have to have a prince rescue her.""  Okay, it's a DVD for children.  While there isn't a whole lot of depth, a complicated plot or believeable details, Barbie is indeed solving problems.

2.  Ken gets more depth than I've ever seen.  First off, Raquel (an unknown to me) staged the breakup.  He spends much of the DVD going through mishap after mishap trying to reach Barbie and make up with her.  He gets ""snotted"" by a child on the plane and licked by a pig.  I still wouldn't call him an intellectual powerhouse, but he does seem to care about Barbie.

3.  Some parents said the troubles were too mature, with Barbie getting fired and the break-up, for young children.  As I watched, this story is contrary to the all-too-perfect existence Barbie has always had.  Who would have thought Barbie would get dumped and fired, all in the same day? While I'm not complaining about the troubles, it does seem to be contrary to the entire Barbie ""fairy tale, forget reality"" franchise.

4.  I definitely agree with the treatment of Teresa.  She comes across as a complete ditz.  She seems to think Ken's behavior indicates he was kidnapped by aliens.  Most of her lines are so silly they are ridiculous and that isn't in a good way.  She seems ...uh...medicated? For that matter, I didn't care for Raquel, a very flat character.

5.  The whole concept of this story reminds me of the Bratz Fashion Angels DVD(or whatever it was called).  I despise the Bratz dolls and I couldn't help but make comparisons.

6.  The fake French accents were horrid.  (At least I hope they were fake!) They were a ""strain on the ear"".  The competiting designers from another French fashion house were just nasty, especially with the kidnapping and torture of the fashion fairies with the ""cheap perfume"".

7.  All in all, it was a good kids' DVD.  I even managed to roll in a French language and culture lesson with it.  (Okay, I had to do most of the work, but my daughter's interest was piqued.  I took the opportunity to teach a little.)",1285286400,4,2624,4.5995670995671

We immediately watched the movie twice and she LOVED it.
I tolerated it, but I have never really enjoyed a Barbie movie.  Yes, so do have better music than others, A Christmas Carol for instance, but truthfully this was no different than any other Barbie movie and we have them ALL.

The plot is the same, something bad happens, evil people make it worse, Barbie overcomes, Barbie lives happily ever after. The only thing different about this one is that is takes place in the modern day and doesn't involve Barbie as a mermaid or fairy.

I actually enjoyed the first 10 minutes most.  Barbie gets fired and Ken breaks up with her on the phone...hmmm perhaps it should be called Barbie Reality at Last!",1285200000,3,799,4.566433566433567

It's a pathetic excuse for a kid's movie that is trying to be hip and modern and introducing little girls to the world of twitter, Juicy Couture and boyfriend breakups. ""A Fashion Fairytale"" is anything but. The animation was lame, the dialogue was too filled with ""hip"" phrases and ""teen terms"" to be good, and the characters leave much to be desired. And the clothes are immodest, over-glitterized pink party outfits that no one in the real world would wear. The themes have more sexual content than a Barbie movie has ever had, and I'm truly sorry I bought this sorry excuse for a movie. Even older viewers and Barbie lovers can't enjoy it, because the bar has been set. Listen up, Mattel!
This movie is nothing but an encouragement to have the latest fashions, the top designs, the coolest new cell phones, the hottest boyfriends, and be uber popular at the same time. Please! Children don't need sexy models and lecherous dogs to look up to. Barbie used to stand for something more. Her standards used to be higher. Now she's too busy shopping for even MORE tight, low-cut, haute clothes. And while she's at it, she COULD use another micro miniskirt, couldn't she? The only decent outfit this chick wears is when she's filming for ""the Princess and the Pea."" And she gets fired from that!

My other daughter who will turn 6 loves the ""Barbie"" series and has seen every movie from it and I feel this is not much different.  I think this movie seem to be in the same realm as the ""Barbie Diaries"" versus the ""fairy"" like themes of her past offerings.

It may not be as cute, whimsical, or fairy-like past movies but everyone involved did not seem to have any issues with it.  We like that there is variety in the ""barbie"" series.  The princess and the pea skit at the beginning did seem a little outta place but I guess its there to set up the story and move things forward.

4185018,2,B003RHZ66Q,"The Barbie movies I've seen up to now have been, although cheap looking and with terrible animation, decent entertainment with some nice messages about girl power.  All I can say with this one is: what happened?  I've given the movie two stars only because my 5 year old really enjoyed it...but honestly, I would not recommend it to any of my friends.  To begin with - the start of the movie is confusing and very unsettling for young viewers.  It starts with Barbie as the princess in the Princess and the Pea, getting menaced by the prince's mother...but then the scene shifts to reveal that it is a movie set, and Barbie is an actress.  Some scary Zombie men in pea costumes are introduced (making my 3 year old very anxious), Barbie disagrees with the director and is ridiculed for her ideas and then fired for speaking up, she finds herself humiliated online in a gossip blog, and her boyfriend Ken breaks up with her over the phone.  This is in the first 15 minutes!  Barbie then decides to go to Paris to visit her aunt, a fashion designer.  The negative themes continue from there - upon arrival she meets some nasty fashion designer rivals, and learns her aunt's business has failed.  Of course, this being a Barbie movie, Barbie helps to turn things around, but even then, it's magical (tarted up) ""flairies"" (magic fashion fairies-- huh?-- totally out of place in this movie) that get the credit for making the designs truly special.  How do the flairies do it?  By adding a boatload of glitter, of course!

I find it hard to find a female character to get behind in this movie.  Barbie's friends are barely there, and when they are, they act like airheads, her aunt spends the movie taking pratfalls in ridiculous getups, her aunt's design rivals Jacqueline and Delphine are cruel and simpering, respectively, and the young designer Alice is mousy and self-doubting, even with Barbie's constant prodding.  Barbie herself spends some time doubting her own abilities as an actress- and although she does enjoy the accomplishment of helping her aunt and Alice out of a bad situation, she only ends up personally validated at the end after Ken and a male (agent? director?) show up and profess their admiration.  What the heck?  The men fare no better - Ken is a doofus, for lack of a better word, the men in the movie business are obnoxious...there's a little boy who is annoying and then provides a gross-out moment.  Oh, and the dogs - there's a lecherous male dog, I suppose to fulfill some stereotype of French male behavior.

Really, I'm tempted to take away a star, but like I said, my 5 year old daughter enjoyed it a lot.  She liked the Paris scenes, the fashion show, the glitter.  Both the 3 & 5 year old enjoyed the pets.  But there are much better Barbie movies out there than this.",1284854400,67,2803,4.622222222222222

It started off with wonderful adaptations of classics like the Nutcracker, Swan Lake, and the Princess and the Pauper but has really just deteriorated with each new one.  I really didn't care for Barbie in a Mermaid Tale, but this one is so much worse than that.

Barbie is no longer voiced by Kelly Sheridan, which is a shame and a big loss in itself.  The music and songs are not very fun or catchy like previous Barbie movies.  They have changed Barbie's look too, given her these huge unnatural eyes and a pointy little face.  But in this movie, Barbie is a young adult having to deal with a job loss, a break-up with her boyfriend, and struggling to save a business.  Barbie actually sits and reads hate postings on a blog about her on the internet....they put this in a kids' movie??

My daughters enjoy the sparkly clothes and the scenes with the little magical fashion ""flairies"", which are completely out of place in a movie trying to be so ""realistic"".  It seems to me they are saying that no matter how wonderful the things you create are, they will be so much better if you add some glitter.  Hmmm, like nothing you'll do is good enough.  The main message to ""believe in yourself"" comes off as just lame in this movie, if you even notice it at all.

All in all, there is not much to recommend this movie.  You're not missing out if you skip it and wait and hope for something better with the next Barbie movie.",1284768000,23,1488,4.386861313868613
