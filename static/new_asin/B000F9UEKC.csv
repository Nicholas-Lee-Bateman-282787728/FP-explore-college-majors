so what the main part of this dvd?
GYMNASTICS!!!! i crap you not his whole style is based around it with some ninjutsu thrown in...

good stuff if you wanna be the star of the GYMKATA remake...

seriously shows some good ideas and stuff  and if gymnastics are your forte in ninjutsu this is all you..

me if you do a flip and a handspring comin at me ill laugh becasue you won't have enuff power left to hurt me...

but maybe if you were to ATTACK first and then use the stuff?

the fire portion is 5 stars..
