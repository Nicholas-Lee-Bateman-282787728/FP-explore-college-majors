5053389,5,B0073GZWY8,"I just finished this ride and feel compelled to comment on it. What an amazing cycling experience! I had originally intended to go only about 30-40 minutes at first just to try it out, but I found that I couldn't stop pedaling to it. It was that much fun! My goals of weight/fat loss, heart health and overall fitness are met with this video, and the views from the mountain are spectacular. This is a ride I will keep coming back to again and again.",1328400000,,450,4.305882352941176

8509210,2,B0073GZWY8,"Its a home movie, the video quality is pretty sad, its grainy.  Considering it was burned to a BluRay disc means nothing when the footage was probably not shot in 1080P. My second observation is the menu and music not worth $33",1435276800,,227,4.404761904761905
8509211,3,B0073GZWY8,Not caring for the heart health videos.  Too much narrative!,1422748800,,60,5.0
8509212,5,B0073GZWY8,"Among all of CVO's training videos I own, this one's scenery is the one I like the most. Being on the Heart Health series, you don't have the training dashboard with the map, and intensity, and route profile (which is perfect for when you're training climbing, or intervals). In this one the scenery is only yours to enjoy while pedaling. Great for easy, base endurance miles. To add more variety, I sometimes mute the video and listen to music on my earphones.",1417132800,,461,4.634146341463414
8509213,3,B0073GZWY8,"I expect Blu-Ray to be superior to regular DVD. This looked just like a regular DVD, although sold as Blu-Ray. The blurry picture detracts from the wonderful video.",1412726400,,164,4.892857142857143
8509214,2,B0073GZWY8,"The DVD, was scratched, Initially it works, but at this moment the video is frozzen and the audio does not work.",1411603200,,112,4.380952380952381
8509215,3,B0073GZWY8,"Rather just plug into my music. I think if I wanted to really have a set workout with particular cadence and inclines to meet, this would work for me. However, at this point in time just getting some exercise with tunes gives me more for my day. It's worth the try if your tunes are not getting you onto the bike or you have a set race/trip you are working towards.",1380844800,,365,4.154929577464789
8509216,5,B0073GZWY8,"Good for a beginner, gets your heart going, and scenery is nice to look at , better than staring at the four walls while you ride.",1362873600,,130,4.038461538461538
8509217,5,B0073GZWY8,"This video will really help you to understand how to discipline your heart rate during a bike ride, and explain exactly why that is so important.  It is one of Paul's best video's in explaining why we all need to work on knowing what the different heart rate zones really mean on a ride.

We have about 20 of these video's and this one is actually one of my favorites.  Not because it's an exhausting workout, but because it really helps remind me of the things that I often times do wrong in regards to heart rate.

These are awesome videos.",1358380800,,542,4.336633663366337
8509218,5,B0073GZWY8,"The Heart Health series is a slower pace, relaxing ride.  The sights and music are well suited to a recovery ride, a relaxing journey, and no worries about heart rate, pace, or effort. This DVD is well worth adding to your collection.",1350691200,,234,4.571428571428571
8509219,5,B0073GZWY8,"This may be the most beautiful scenery of any of the ""Cycling Videos Online"" DVDs. We cycle through the area of the Continental Divide. There are beautiful winding roads with gorgeous trees. Okay, that's the scenery part of it. Now for the workout.

There is about 1-1/2 hours of road that we go through. This is supposed to be a ""Heart Health"" selection, so we keep our heart rate lower than in some others. Of course we can do whatever we want while Paul isn't watching. He'll never know that we upped the resistance on our bike higher than he recommended, that we didn't take a break when suggested, and that we went a little faster than we were supposed to be going. We could do that.  However, I followed the plan and enjoyed it very much.

There was a mess-up at the end of the DVD where it stopped and I couldn't get it to go past that point. I'm not sure what that's all about, but I'll work around it. I haven't had that problem with any of the others and I have almost all of the Cycling Videos Online.",1333324800,,1012,4.260416666666667
