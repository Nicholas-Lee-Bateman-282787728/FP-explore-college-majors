8228920,2,B000XPRMCQ,A little dated just so so.  The lead was a little on the hammy side - and the girl too mousy.  Just didn't click for me.,1384300800,,120,3.576923076923077
8228921,1,B000XPRMCQ,"Dude.  Omg.  You have to be smoking crack to like this.  I suggest to preview the first episode before you buy this.

And I apologize to everyone I just insulted with the crack analogy... but... seriously.... like...... just.......seriously.

Go to Drama Fever, and watch a normal K-Drama's that everybody else watches, and you will be happy with the selection variety.

My wife is Korean, and though I never in my life, ever, ever, ever, wanted to watch a soppy cliched soap opera, whether in English or Korean, I finally relented, on the basis of exposure for language learning.

I'm trying to learn Korean, so I'm watching YouTube episodes of  and also found a decent action-packed K-Drama called Iris.  Believe it or not, it's totally tolerable for a dude to watch.  In fact, aside from the 80's synth rock montages with vaseline-lens filters (you KNOW what I'm talking about), it's a pretty good TV show.

On the other hand, THIS Drama, Super Rookie, is.... just unbelievable trash.",1382400000,,987,4.885542168674699
8228922,4,B000XPRMCQ,"This is a fun movie. I had not read any reviews, but I decided to give it a try. It was much better than I anticipated. Have you ever been odd man out in a life situation? This young man falls into the sweet job spot accidently, It is guaranteed to give you a laugh and a cry from time to time. It really is a today type story with so many people in the world out of work. I enjoyed it and recommend it as a different type of movie with a great cast. Being the kind of loser guy, he makes his parents, especially his mother, when he lands this great job...how does he tell them it is a mistake? He can't. He kind of likes where he is at wearing suits and all. On the other hand, he feels guilty for the deception, but it wasn't his fault....it was the fault of, well I do not give away plots. Buy it or watch it on one of the networks that offer viewing. You will enjoy it! I keep checking Amazon's list of Korean dramas, etc. They are doing a great job keeping up and the prices are good too.",1368230400,,993,3.9207920792079207
8228923,4,B000XPRMCQ,"I was pleasantly surprised by this drama, it was nice to see a show that wasn't only about emotional entanglements and and super rich guys who win over the poor unconventional girl... oh wait, that's still pretty much what this is but anyway, it doesn't break out of the genre by any means but if you like Korean dramas you'll most likely enjoy this one.",1368144000,,354,4.461538461538462
8228924,5,B000XPRMCQ,"I bought this product as a gift for an aunt who is into Korean dramas (Kdramas). She's very particular about the kind of dramas that she watches, avoiding dramas where major characters die and preferring light dramas with regular bits of comedy to break the tension and keep the drama from being too emotionally sapping. Although this drama is a little older than what she was used to, she was really excited to get it after reading it's description and based on other reviews, it was the perfect gift to give (at an affordable price too!)",1361404800,2,539,4.625
8228925,5,B000XPRMCQ,"Watched this on dramafever.com - it's one of nine Korean dramas I decided I wanted in my collection...it's silly but fun...and if you're an Eric Mun fan, then go for it!",1358035200,,169,4.483870967741935
8228926,5,B000XPRMCQ,"It looks to be a good drama I have not seen it yet
but I know it will be a good one to",1357776000,,86,2.782608695652174
8228927,5,B000XPRMCQ,"Super Rookie is hilarious. Eric Mun portrayed his character well, as did the actors who played his deadbeat but loyal friends. The storyline is simple, ""rags to lucking-out"" because of a computer error. I enjoyed the way the character - the Super Rookie - stayed grounded no matter the mean digs and attacks on his person by the upper class and the accidental successes he achieved. This drama was fun.",1356307200,,402,4.757142857142857
8228928,5,B000XPRMCQ,"Like the other reviews, you need to give it a go before you judge it.  The title may come off lame and cheesy, but it does provide some interesting scenes in what can happen in the corporate world and how someone who is of a lower status in a number of areas i.e. financially, physically etc can actually succeed when either given the opportunity, provided the opportunity or take the opportunity.",1347753600,,397,4.591549295774648
8228929,5,B000XPRMCQ,"I bought this on a whim. At first I wasn't sure if I was going to buy it because the description sounded lame, so I watched a short vid on youtube to see if it looked interesting. And it did. I bought it and started watching it with my boyfriend (who doesn't watch kdramas). Oddly enough, my boyfriend loves this show. And I love it too, though its not my favorite (Birth of the Rich is).

To sum it up without giving too much away, a loser of a guy is a loser at 30 years old and applies at this big company who only hire the best accidentally gets hired and theres lots of laughs and some sad moments, but not overdone.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes kdramas or even just likes foreign movies.",1325808000,4,708,4.1231884057971016
