DVD is not working so well in my wife's car CD player.  I sure the DVD is fine but will never be watched.",1404864000,,276,4.111111111111111
7943877,4,B00005LIN1,"This is a fresh interpretation of ""The Four Seasons"".  Of the many I have heard, it is my favorite.  The production is interesting and very well photographed.  I do not enjoy interviews with artists - so this loses a star for that.  Still, highly recommended",1353196800,,258,4.666666666666667
7943878,5,B00005LIN1,"Kennedy's read of Vivaldi is as fresh as controvertial. As much so as Nigel himself is. This version brings a renewed interpretation of  a timeless music. Some purist may argue against this approach. But for the music lover that seeks to enjoy works from different angles of interpretation this film brings a very interesting, innovative and personal rendering from Kennedy for our modern times.

7943879,4,B00005LIN1,"While this performance may not appeal to authenticity purists, I find it quite inspiring and enjoyable.  Kennedy is truly interested in and inspired by Vivaldi, as am I.  Highly recommended for the more adventurous classical enthusiast.",1055462400,2,236,5.527777777777778
7943880,4,B00005LIN1,"This guy is always surprising. Here, we can watch a ""MTV-like Vivaldi Performance"".
In front of a young audience, Kennedy (former know as ""Nigel Kennedy"", something like Prince's change of name) plays the fiddle with a lot of bravura, although not faultless. At some moments, he improvises a bit (mostly at slow movements), jumps a bit (making some boring noises), makes strange faces.
But, after all, we have the impression of having seen a competent musician, with his own ideas about Vivaldi and the way of play it, accompanied by a superb team of musicians, the English Chamber Orchestra.
I believe this is a better choice compared to Karajan/Mutter version: the austrian maestro choiced very slow tempi, and the Berliners are playing with a huge formation, innadequate for baroque.
Well, despite some minor faults (jumps and other idiosyncrasies)
and a very modern production (including exotic camera angles, scenarios - very funny at ""Summer"", and other ""special effects"", related to pop music videos), is a interesting DVD. Musically, is very good - true team spirit between Kennedy and the ECO, the high level of these musicians, and good ""extras"", like the poems by Vivaldi himself about the seasons.",1027555200,4,1209,5.1421319796954315
