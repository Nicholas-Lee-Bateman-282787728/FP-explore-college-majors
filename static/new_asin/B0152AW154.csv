7426302,5,B0152AW154,I love this movie.  It was fun to watch.  The wedding at the bowling alley was a riot.,1452816000,,86,3.7222222222222223
7426303,4,B0152AW154,"Nice looking stars, a romance, and Hallmark sensibilities make up this somewhat tepid and slow stroyline that's saved by the ever watchable Autumn Reeser.

Ms. Reeser starred in one of my all time favorite romcom's, Hallmarks ""Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.""  Here, she's the head of a candy company dealing with domain/trademark issues, of all things, questionable lawyers of which the somewhat weak spined, but good looking hero works for, and throwing a masquerade ball where romance is sure to bloom.  It plays as a reverse gender Cinderella(ok, good idea, Jerry Lewis), but lacking umph in humor and sustained interest.

The good things are some romance, a ball, and best of all, Autumn Reeser.  She has an unique energy, dresses well and comes across genuine and expressive; moreover, she has quite a varied acting background including some strange provocative roles before really hitting her own niche now in Hallmark.

If you're looking for Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade(LTP) Part 2, this isn't it.  See, when it comes out, ""I do, I do, I do"" with both Reeser and Antonio Cupo(her costar in LTP, but in a different type of relationship) along with the super actress that played her friend.

Midnight Masquerade is a 3 star movie getting a 4 star rating, by me, because of Autumn Reeser.  If you don't like her or her handsome cinderfella, you'll be bored to evil steppeople tears, but... I hope she keeps doing this genre.",1451520000,2,1442,4.901234567901234
7426304,4,B0152AW154,"Autumn Reeser makes me smile, there's something about her. I got all smitten with her in Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and A Country Wedding, and I Do, I Do, I Do. So, you see, I wouldn't at all fuss if she were to star in every Hallmark movie ever. I'm sure Autumn has a dark, broody side to her. But she tamps that down for her stints at Hallmark, and she channels the sweet and spirited and gamine bits of her.

Midnight Masquerade, it's a 2014 Hallmark flick. It's also a modern-day gender bender on the Cinderella story (and, yes, we know Jerry Lewis did it first). Her dad having opted for retirement, Elyse Samford (Autumn Reeser) inherits the family candy empire. But a trademark infringement lawsuit against a rival candy company right away puts the new CEO of Samford Candy to the test. Elyse consults Higgins & Sons, unbeknownst to her a law firm composed of nogoodniks in upper management.

Our point-of-view character is actually Rob Carelli (Christopher Russell), a talented young lawyer but who is a pushover because he's a really decent dude. Rob is deemed to be ""no dummy, but not a lot of practical experience"" and this gives Higgins' two weasely sons license to give him all their work. Maybe the best thing about this movie is Rob's relationship with his awesome 12-year-old niece Ruby (Helen Colliander). Their interactions are just nice and feel so real and down-to-earth.

A courteous Elyse invites the law firm staff to the annual Samford Candy Halloween costume ball. Except that Rob can't attend, what with the Higgins brothers' dick move of piling on last-minute work on his desk. Doesn't mean that Rob can't sneak away, anyway, and go to the ball. There, costumed up as a masked prince and under the moonlight, he sweeps Elyse off her feet.

Two plot points make up the second half of the movie. One is Elyse's yearning for her mysterious Prince Charming (or is ""her Cinderfella"" more accurate?). Another is the sniffing out of a dastardly scheme to cheat Elyse out of her inheritance. But, really, it's just some confusing kerfuffle over domain name registration. Basically, I was just biding my time, waiting out that plot point until the narrative shifted back to what's up with Elyse's search for her prince. Autumn Reeser and Christopher Russell make the romance work. Russell comes across as a genuinely nice guy, and I just can't take my eyes off Autumn Reeser. But the movie's secret weapon is the kid, Helen Colliander, who is a natural. Young girls, specially, will love how key the niece is in making it all work out. I guess you could say she's the fairy godmother in this story. Since this is a Hallmark joint, expect lots of good old-fashioned warmth and sentiment. As ever, Hallmark Channel offers the best ""comfort food"" viewing on television. Anyway, if you're in a mood for bonding over bowling and foiling a stealth takeover and a fun and funny retelling of a timeless fairy tale, then Midnight Masquerade is your bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.",1448755200,8,2988,4.784883720930233

He was a highly competent attorney who was doing the work of the two attorney sons of the owner's law firm.  He risked his job to do the right thing.  I liked the character of the niece and the close relationship between Ron and Ruby, his niece.  Ruby had a role in bringing about a great ending.  Autumn Reeser was great as the female love interest.  There were so many interesting characters in the movie:  Sam, the gruff former attorney, Howard, the dad of Autumn Reeser's character, the two attorney sons, and Ron's secretary, Merry.

Their easy going relationship and their love and respect for each other.  The father decided to retire and leave his very successful candy business to his daughter.  In a way this movie was like a Cinderella story, yet it wasn't the female who had the wicked sisters.  It was the male lead who worked as a lawyer for a law firm.  He was a nice-Cinderella type who did all the work for the boss's two sons (also lawyers in their Daddy's firm) and never got the credit for what he did.  The male lead also was there for his single Mom sister and her daughter.  He was a bowling buddy with his niece and the female lead also liked to bowl (with her Dad).  At the beginning of the movie these lead characters first meet at the bowling alley and later at the law firm.  The ""sparks"" fly when he shows up to the masquerade ball as a prince (thanks to the seamstress skills of his sister) and she is the princess and they do make a beautiful couple.
