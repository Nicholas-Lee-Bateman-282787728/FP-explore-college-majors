922905,2,6304763573,Typical of the war movies of that age.  Very much the Americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice.  I enjoyed looking at an America that was.  Would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life.,1168819200,2,255,4.5

...per the earlier review, but more properly a Lockheed Hudson light bomber (rated an attack plane by the USAAF as either the A-28 or the A-29), which was converted to a combat aircraft from a fast civilian airliner to British specifications before the war.  Several hundred of these were taken expediently from Lend-Lease manufacture into USAAF and USN inventory after Pearl Harbor, and the Hudson is listed as having achieved the USAAF's first antisubmarine warfare (ASW) kill in the Atlantic after the formal opening of hostilities.

Interestingly, the bomber in the movie is depicted as having a tail gunner's position (it did not) and as having a single waist gunner (ditto).  Hudson aircraft taken into the US inventory commonly had the big British Boulton-Paul dual .303 MG waist turret removed, to be replaced with a simple single-weapon .50 caliber dorsal firing station (like the one depicted in the movie as being manned by the radio operator).  The previous reviewer's confusion is therefore somewhat understandable.  Hopefully, enemy viewers of the movie also drew false impressions about the Hudson, and didn't as readily seek to exploit the aircraft's posterior and ventral vulnerabilities.

As for the film itself, the most interesting part was the depiction of aerial gunnery training, which definitely did include shooting skeet in order to give the trainees better preparatory conditioning for deflection shooting.

922907,4,6304763573,"Although dated by today's standards (""Holy Christopher!""), the movie gives an accurate account of aerial gunnery training in WWII. For the first hour (of the 90 minute film), all aspects of gunnery training are portrayed. I fully enjoyed the epic, even though the characters end up in a B-25 Mitchell. (I'm partial to B-24 Liberators!) Well worth the watch!!",1018396800,22,358,5.084745762711864

923015,2,6304763573,"I  was  born  and  raised  in  Harlingen  Tx.  where  this  epic  was  filmed...took  my  first  airplane  ride  in  an  AF  T-29 at  H.A.F.B.  many  years  ago;  back  in  WWII,  the  base  had  the  unfortunate  name,  HAGS::  Harlingen  Aerial  Gunnery  School--prospective  bomber  gunners  would  train  by  riding  in  the  backs  of  T-6  Texans  and  firing  .30  Cal  Browning  machine  guns.  Richard  Arlen  was  a  fine  actor  of  the  30's  and  40's,  but  this wasn't  anybody's  best  effort.  Ten  years  after  my  first  ride,  I  was  landing  my  own  aircraft,  a  hot  little  experimental biplane  on  top  of  the Confederate  AF  B-17,  the  Red  Raider--pulled  up  before  I  was  chopped  and  diced  by  the  17's  four  1820's  and maneuvered  around  to  the  diagonal  strip....and  that  little  anecdote is  far  more  interesting  than  the  film.

923112,4,6304763573,"Great old movie demonstrating traditional values of patriotism, comradery, courage and fear where the protagonist becomes the hero. Robert Mitchum has an uncredited role.",1400025600,,170,6.125
923113,4,6304763573,"A great deal of nostalgia influences my high rating of Aerial Gunner  it took me back to my childhood during WWII when I was totally addicted, crazed, about war movies. This one had all the great cliches before they become cliches. The rivalry over a girl, the heroics and sacrifices. Even the ""bad"" guy turned out a winner in the best example of The American Way! And thank god, there was not one note of the Glenn Miller music that has polluted every one of this movie's contemporaries.
  Best of all, I always get this same little laugh whenever I watch one these old war flicks: Most of the actor grunts are guys in their 30s or 40s, when the truth was, and is today, the grunts are kids. Maybe it would be better today if all the real soldiers were of advanced age. Maybe they would use their influence to keep us out of wars in an effort to keep their own butts from being shot off.
  Aerial Gunner is a low budget movie  probably cost about $835 to produce  but that just added to its charm. I think you graybeards out there would love this thing.",1398729600,,1054,4.292929292929293
923114,4,6304763573,"The film's PHYSICAL quality was poor having been produced/filmed in I believe 1943; the screen image was too dark in many places but what can you do about a film made during World War II?

923117,4,6304763573,"The plot of the story is good.  Teaches us that everyone can change their life.  And for the age of the film, it isn't a bad quality.  Typical 1050's film.",1395705600,,155,4.1

923119,4,6304763573,"These black and white films offer more than just a storyline. They are a look into the heart and soul of an era that existed more than half a century ago when war encompassed the globe for a second time. Young men entered military service and women became part of the work force. War and romance were inevitably linked. This film offers an interesting story with information that is, for the most part, accurate. Harlingen, Texas  was indeed home to the 'aerial gunnery school' and the training is well described and accurate.  The two heroes had known each other since childhood and came from very different backgrounds that led to their antagonistic attitude toward each other. As fate would have it, both were assigned to the same course for aerial gunner school. The young lady? The sister of one of their classmates. Follow their path of bravery and courage from the Pacific Theater to the single hospital bed where the story is being told. For those of us who enjoy this genre, you won't be disappointed by either the actors or the storyline. Definitely recommended!",1382918400,2,1072,4.789189189189189
923120,4,6304763573,"I enjoyed seeing my home town of Harlingen the way it was when it was an air force base.  Many of the buildings were still standing during the '70s.  For many years, the Confederate Air Force was base out of Harlingen and housed their planes in many of the hangers that was shown on the film.  It was nice to learn some of the history of the Gunnery School even though the characters in the film were fictional.",1380672000,,411,4.243589743589744
923121,3,6304763573,"How can you review this movie? To a modern audience, the entertainment quality is lacking. If you know a thing or two about history, you will understand that it's only because it's basically a propaganda film...and understandably so. The lines are wooden and the scenes lack a certain believable quality, but the context of the times lends the film a poignant atmosphere that connects us with the fear and uncertainty that the participants of these missions lived through. Perhaps you have to have lived through the 1940's to understand why such simple ideas had a powerful impact on the hopes and dreams of an entire American generation.",1377907200,,638,4.97196261682243
923201,3,6304763573,This is one of the Pine-Thomas Productions films for Paramount.  Alpha's quality is acceptable except for one dialogue splice.  It is a Medallion TV print which has replaced the Paramount beginning and ending title cards.  No Alpha logo.,1373673600,,237,5.184210526315789
923202,3,6304763573,"I ordered this movie because it was filmed in part in my home town at what was then the Harlingen Army Gunnery school, where they trained gunners for our bomber crews in WWII.  It was interesting to see what the area looked like in 1943, and to see a few familiar structures that are either still standing, or at least were still there when I was growing up in the area in the late 60's and early 70s.  As for the movie itself, it's got decent acting, and a reasonably interesting storyline that includes a little bit of target-shooting action, and a rivalry over a woman, but if you're looking for a thriller action war movie, this is not the one for you.  Incidentally, Robert Mitchum, who is listed on the updated cover of this movie was not a very well-known actor at the time the movie was made, and only has a bit part in the movie.  The original movie posters did not even mention him.",1369958400,2,892,4.323353293413174

(Drum roll)....Aerial Gunners! When they're not busy training with their .50 caliber machine guns they're busy trying to outmaneuver each other for the attention of the scrumptious Amelita Ward, who looks young enough to be their daughter. (I'm not sure if she was Mrs. Mugs Mahoney at this time. Ha! Imagine Mugs as a bomber's Tailgun Charlie!). Anyways the  men carry on like  a couple of Tom Sawyers trying to impress Becky Thatcher, which seems out of place since they are both well beyond  the age when men typically do that. Of course one guy is the straight arrow and the other is the rat who learns his lesson albeit too late to do him much good.  It's kind of funny how that happens in these movies. You'd almost think it would be better to NOT learn your lesson, that way you would at least dramatically increase your life span.
