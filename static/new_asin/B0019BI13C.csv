3431116,5,B0019BI13C,My nephew doesn't even listen to Reggaeton music but he was interested in how much Reggaeton and Rap are alike,1342310400,,110,4.55
3431117,4,B0019BI13C,"This dvd was informative and interesting. I bought this dvd because I thought it would include interviews with the artists listed on the cover. I was hoping Ivy Queen would be interviewed. There were several interviews with producers, and DJ's, including Luny Tunes, DJ Negro, DJ Nelson and DJ Playero. The housing project of Villa Kennedy was also shown, DJ Playero also shows viewers where Daddy Yankee was shot. The interview with Luny Tunes was interesting, I did not know they worked at Harvard University in the kitchen,the dvd also included a segment about Vico C,one of the first Latin Rappers. If you don't know much about Reggaeton like myself this dvd will perhaps help you to understand how this genre came about.",1318464000,,725,4.902439024390244
3431118,5,B0019BI13C,"This documentary is a lot more factual (full of information) than I expected.  I also loved seeing the barrios where many of the reggaeton artists grew up.  I've liked reggaeton for a while but it convinced me that I HAVE to actually go to PR to experience it -- I was up until the wee hours of the morning yesterday brainstorming places to stay, flights, etc. for an upcoming trip!",1233792000,3,382,4.442857142857143

8273226,4,B0019BI13C,"This is a great documentary highlighting the creation of reggaeton through the poverty-stricken areas of Puerto Rico. It has great interviews and features all artists that were instrumental in it's rise. Be aware however, if you are sharing this with students, that there are several minutes of scantily clad ladies shaking their derri&egrave;re and special parts all over the screen. I just fast forwarded through the section I deemed inappropriate for my students. However, they loved the music and story of the documentary. Get with the times and teach your students about reggaeton. It's as much a part of Hispanic culture a salsa and merengue!",1396656000,,648,5.180952380952381
8273227,4,B0019BI13C,"The documentary is good if your curious about the region of the Reggaeton sound.
If you want to know where Reggaeton came from, this movie will tell you.",1382659200,,153,4.5
