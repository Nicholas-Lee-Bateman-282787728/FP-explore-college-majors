2274126,4,B0009A1BW2,"Brenda Blethyn's understated performance is amazing as a woman who goes through the shocking ordeal of being unexpectedly abandoned by her husband when it seemed the marriage was idyllic.  The emotions she goes through, from the initial confusion when her husband doesn't return home one night, to the worry over the next couple of days, to the shock when told he was seen with another woman, to the anger and grief when he confesses to her...and then to eventual acceptance at the end is all very convincing from this great actress.  As her husband leaves her to care for HIS three aging relatives (mother, great-aunt and cousin)she does it all without the slightest complaint...in fact it's something she's always enjoyed doing, but the fact that she's now given no choice in the matter adds to her turmoil of emotions. Through it all, she handles everything with a grace and dignity that not many people would be capable of, even going as far as having her husband, his younger girlfriend and her two children over for tea. There are several interesting scenes that indicate she's at least thought of some alternatives ways of dealing with everything...thoughts of getting rid of the ""oldies"" as they're called, and even thoughts of suicide.  But, as most of us would do, she presses on day by day, waiting to see if she'll ever be able to accept and move on.  This was a simple and understated film that's definitely worth a couple of hours of your time.",1215043200,15,1458,4.773809523809524

8058594,5,B0009A1BW2,"> Brenda Blethyn is an actress who rarely disappoints, and in this film, she shines. She plays Jess a woman married for 20 years to Jacob, played by Kevin Whately. They seem happy as we meet them, even though they live with his obstinate, elderly mother, played by Rosemary Harris, his elderly Aunt, played by Anna Massey, and his elderly, religious uncle, played by Peter Sallis. All is well until Jacob goes out for a pint and never returns.
>
> As the film begins we find Jacob has taken up with a younger woman who has two children, and she is now pregnant with Jacob's child. Jacob and his mother are a pair, both demanding to be taken care of, right now, with little or no thought of what their demands mean for others. Jess trying to pick up the pieces of her life while caring for these three elders on her own, now begins to realize what a fool Jacob is. Even though she loves  him, she is better off without him.
>
> Jess finding her way could not be in better hands than she is being played by Brenda Blethyn. A superb performance, the facial expressions, the tears, the slump of her body tells us the story without words. Jess has friends old and new who help her through this morass, and she rallies. The elders are so demanding, but they are her life. Starting a new is not the usual pathway, and this film shows us the difficulties and the rewards.

8058597,3,B0009A1BW2,"This is a soap opera, gruesome to watch and painful at every turn.  That said, the film has some virtues. The acting is first rate; Blethyn is a marvel, on the Hepburn and Streep level of excellence.  The casting was exceptional, and the director was intelligent. The problem is the script by the great Alan Plater.  While there are flashes of insight and fine dialogue, on the whole, it is sad, tearful, gut-wrenching, without a single moment of relief.  Tears flow, angst dominates, hopelessness reigns.  I can't imagine anyone not in acting school wanting to endure this film.  I might add that it is wearisome to see yet again the elderly treated as invalids and monsters.  A great many of us are neither.  Honest.",1417910400,4,718,4.733870967741935
8058598,5,B0009A1BW2,"This was Region 2 and I realized too late that you can get it for the U.S.  I decided to watch it on my computer and it is a gem. Brenda Blethyn is ALWAYS fantastic to watch and Kevin Whately, as the cad husband, is very good, indeed. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with Ms. Blethyn that I haven't loved. This is one of them.",1415577600,2,331,3.8676470588235294
