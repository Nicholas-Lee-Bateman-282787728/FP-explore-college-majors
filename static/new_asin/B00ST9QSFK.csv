6992022,1,B00ST9QSFK,Do not need to see more than the 1st episode.,1435276800,2,45,3.6
6992023,1,B00ST9QSFK,Dumb.,1433808000,2,5,5.0
6992024,2,B00ST9QSFK,I was mildly engaged until THAT episode.  I found it very disturbing.,1433721600,3,69,4.75
6992025,4,B00ST9QSFK,"Seems to be written well, and nice range of gay characters. Have to see where it goes from here...",1433376000,2,98,4.2105263157894735
6992026,5,B00ST9QSFK,"Awesome British TV. Well written and acted. From the people who did ""Queer as Folk""...very entertaining",1431043200,,103,5.5
6992027,4,B00ST9QSFK,"I don't normally do reviews like this one.  When I review something, I want to review the content and the show.  Not the way it's presented here.  I normally get annoyed when I see others do it.  But I just have to warn people that this version (and I'm guessing US's digital in general) is edited.  I've seen the British version, which is why I bought this when it was finally available here.  So imagine my surprise and annoyance that it's edited.  I didn't watch a lot of it, but they use the blurring to censor parts of it.  It's really annoying.

The show itself is excellent.  Very funny, well-written and well-acted.  It's a great show and I'd recommend it.  But I wanted to give a little warning to those on the fence or those who, like me, thought they were purchasing an uncensored TV show.  I wish I had known that before I purchased, so I wanted to let others know.",1430179200,28,877,4.339506172839506
6992028,5,B00ST9QSFK,"Really like the way the show has ""companion"" series i.e. ""Banana"". Clever idea. Funny. The gay crowd will roar.",1429315200,,111,4.894736842105263
6992029,5,B00ST9QSFK,"As a middle-aged gay guy, this show works for me big-time. Nobody goes from 0 to 60 on emotional intensity like Russell T. Davies. I watch episodes of this alternating with Banana--they operate independently of each other, but it's more fun to get the whole world. It's candy-colored content, told with as much TV sophistication as any David Simon show...the dialogue is fast, the exposition minimal, the connections abundant. The show goes fast and if it's hard to keep up, just watch it again and see what you missed the first time around.",1438905600,3,541,4.827956989247312
6992030,5,B00ST9QSFK,I began watching Cucumber on Showtime once I discovered it and loved the series but had missed the first episode so was glad to get to see see it.  Apparently the series won't be coming back which really disappoints me.,1438819200,2,219,4.475
6992031,5,B00ST9QSFK,Great show very well done.,1438214400,,26,4.4
6992032,5,B00ST9QSFK,"Great show, Dramadey! Watch it!",1438214400,,31,5.4
6992033,1,B00ST9QSFK,Censored.  Don't waste your money.,1437523200,9,34,5.8
6992034,5,B00ST9QSFK,Excellent show,1436400000,,14,6.5
6992035,3,B00ST9QSFK,"Vibrant, perhaps a bit melodramatic acting, in the same vein as 'Queer as Folk', but this time about gay men's middle age angst, which apparently now starts in mid-20's, and the same tired stereotypes of older men lusting after younger ones (or straight ones), and younger ones hooking up on Grindr and having tons of meaningless sex. Please Lord tell me a different story. Still - always fun trying to understand a Manchester accent.",1436400000,,434,4.878378378378378
6992036,4,B00ST9QSFK,"English humor and drama are so dark, which always throws me off because, we Americans, see Downton Abbey and expect all the British to be royalty or act as if they are. You'll get none of that here and I love it. This is hilarious, yet you encounter many issues in the gay community or just relationships in general.",1436400000,,316,4.372881355932203
6992037,5,B00ST9QSFK,Loved this little gem- You have to watch it with it's companion show Banana.,1436227200,2,76,4.5
6992038,1,B00ST9QSFK,Light hearted. Until episode 6 when inexplicably  the tone turns very dark and the leading character is killed violently. A good way of avoiding finding a resolution to the difficult relationship between Lance and Henry. Not impressed. Very disappointed in writing that doesn't address the difficulties in real realtiosnhips. Skip this unless you enjoy watching a man (Lance) having his head bashed in.,1435622400,3,402,5.380952380952381
8699166,4,B00ST9QSFK,"Hilarious, heartbreaking show, a wonderful follow-up to the original ""Queer As Folk"" that follows several middle-aged gay men and their youthful, more free-spirited compatriots. It addresses issues of gay life (and life in general) that you rarely see portrayed, but feel bracingly original and true. The dialogue sparkles, the characters all feel so real and lived-in, and the plot twists can be truly breathtaking. PLEASE somebody issue this series on a R1 DVD!",1500595200,,463,5.3561643835616435
8699167,1,B00ST9QSFK,VERY stereotypical and negative about gay life.,1481587200,,47,5.857142857142857
8699168,5,B00ST9QSFK,"Love this show!!  Why haven't they released it in the US????  Just realize that it this set is the PAL version (for Europe) and here in the US it will only play on your computer.  If you want to use it in a DVD player, you'll have to convert it to NTSC format and burn it onto new discs using Nero or some other such program.",1455580800,3,325,3.893939393939394
8699169,5,B00ST9QSFK,Very good series and to bad it is gone.  I really enjoyed watching it.,1454544000,,70,4.0
8699170,1,B00ST9QSFK,AMAZON version is censored!!! BOOOOOO! it should state that in the review. it was a waste of money due to the censoring.,1449273600,8,120,4.5
8699171,5,B00ST9QSFK,Great show with a good balance of older and younger gay characters. Make sure you watch Banana as it helps immerse yourself me in these characters lives,1443916800,,152,4.666666666666667
8699172,4,B00ST9QSFK,It was a great series from start to finish hopefully they make another series like this I would definitely say if you like watching a series watching this one you will love it,1442707200,,175,4.333333333333333
8699173,1,B00ST9QSFK,I thought it was one of the worst shows I have ever seen.  I kept checking my watch to see if it was almost over.,1441065600,,113,3.52
8699174,1,B00ST9QSFK,Trashy. Didn't care for it at all.,1440633600,,34,4.0
8699175,5,B00ST9QSFK,Watch Banana before watching Cucumber,1439856000,2,37,6.6
