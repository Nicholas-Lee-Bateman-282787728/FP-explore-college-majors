Oscar-winning feel-good story of triumph against overwhelming odds that's one of the best films of the 1970s.
In this start to what would become the greatest sports franchise in movie history, writer/star Stallone introduces club fighter Rocky Balboa, a nobody who boxes for $50 purses. Fate intervenes when world's champ Apollo Creed (Weathers) picks Rocky at random from a list of unknowns. Rocky is trained for his match with Creed by elderly Mickey Goldmill (Meredith), a one-time journeyman pug who until now had no faith in the younger man's boxing skills. Rocky also dates and eventually marries a shy pet shop clerk named Adrian Pennino (Shire), and gives her brother Paulie (Young) his old job of collecting debts for a small time hood.
Highlight is the exciting fight sequence.

ROCKY II
Apollo Creed demands and gets a rematch. Except for a ""will never happen"" finish, boxing sequences in this popular sequel exceed the first film.
Patterns established here: as Balboa trains for his bout, wife Adrian is the siren of doom who makes a sudden 180 that's just in time to inspire her deflated hubby; Paulie tries making a fast buck on Rocky's fame.

ROCKY III
Champion Rocco Balboa has polished the rough edges from his public persona, while defeating ten palookas hand-picked for him by protective manager/trainer, Mickey Goldmill.
Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a brutal puncher and legitimate title contender, broods over the phoniness of it all and for not being given a chance to fight Rocky, thanks to Mickey's interference. Clubber humiliates Philly's favorite son during a statue dedication, and calls Rocky out. A seething Balboa agrees to meet Lang in the ring, but Mickey wants nothing to do with it.
Rocky convinces Mick to change his mind, and they begin training for the Clubber Lang match. On fight night, Clubber so upsets Mickey, the old pug has a coronary. Rocky is now more concerned for his friend's health than he is about the fight. Lang is able to KO him in a mere round-and-a-half.
As in this series second chapter, Adrian whines that Rocky should just quit, not try for a rematch against Lang, but, looking to avenge Mickey's death, Rocky ignores her. Former foe Apollo Creed offers to help Rock train and they, Adrian and Paulie travel to Apollo's old stomping grounds, L.A.
Another reused plot device is making brother-in-law Paulie as conniving as ever, a real glutton for the fast buck.
New pattern established: killing off a main character (Mickey growls his way into Valhalla).
