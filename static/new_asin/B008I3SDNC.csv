5166961,5,B008I3SDNC,"Ms Etta James was a Real Singer did it her way and will be missed she was a down to earth person funny and caring I can honestly say I went to many Etta James concerts in town and in San Francisco, Las Vegas too.  I dedicated this CD & DVD to my brother in-law Angel Rodriguez who first told me about Etta back in the 60's.  Damn the girl can sing and she made me a fan for many many years. Peaches you may be gone but I will always carry you and the music in my heart God Bless and the the family too.  Her two sons you can play, your band was tight and I hope you continue in the music buz. The little girl sure looks like Etta..smile.  Buy the CD ""Sugar On The Floor"" a song Etta tore up and see Ms James live on the DVD too. Keep Soul music alive.!",1366329600,3,752,3.770700636942675
5166962,5,B008I3SDNC,"This DVD is the best!  It is the next best thing to seeing her live in concert.  I saw her twice in concert, and although Etta James is no longer with us, this DVD is a wonderful and lasting ttibute to a great songtress and entertainer.  RIP Etta.",1363737600,,247,4.104166666666667
5166963,5,B008I3SDNC,"I can understand Etta getting upset about Beyonce singing her signature song At Last. On this disc, she shows how it is done through the years.. Great band, think I even see Herbie Mann at one point. Love this Lady.",1361404800,2,215,4.4
5166964,5,B008I3SDNC,Mt favorite singer.  I have loved her since I was a kid.  My teenage brother taught me to dance on her songs. Will truly miss her.  I also brought her book.,1354579200,,156,3.967741935483871

5166966,1,B008I3SDNC,"I was very disappointed and didn't like this item at all, guess I was expecting a younger Etta James singing songs I liked in her earlier days.  Wish I could return this item for something else. I couldn't relate to anything she song and her on-stage performances was the worst I ever seen.",1350432000,,290,4.471698113207547
5166967,5,B008I3SDNC,"For material that is over 20 years old this Blu-ray gives a compelling visit with the late
great Etta James the Queen of the blues.
Having seen Etta twice live this blu-ray did not disappoint either visually or phonically.
It includes her hallmark cut At Last as well as my other favorites How Strong Is a Woman,I Got the Will,Tell Mama,,Come to Mama, and more.
Eagle rock is fast becoming a trusted name for Blu-ray concerts of any vintage! For under 20 dollars this was a no brainer for me.",1350432000,3,492,4.477777777777778
5166968,5,B008I3SDNC,"The world of music lost Etta James this year and it was such a sad time for fans like me who never got the chance to experience Etta
live. But thanks to Eagle Rock entertainment AT LAST we as Etta James fans have something to sing about! Etta James Live at Montreux 1975-1993.
I always wondered when any one of Etta's performances from Montreux would see the light of day and then
surprise, we not only get her full stellar set from 1993, but also parts of other great sets from the 70's and 80's.
The people at Eagle Rock have done such a great job of packing as much as they can of our dear Etta in this
great DVD.",1347321600,10,616,4.099173553719008

5166981,3,B008I3SDNC,This was ok. she was so big she sat most of it. And she didn.t sing any of her best hits. She didn't even hit At Last,1416700800,,117,3.3703703703703702

5166987,5,B008I3SDNC,"Eagle Rock Entertainment continues it's excellent Blu-ray series on artists who have performed at the Montreaux Jazz Festival with this superb concert featuring the legendary Etta James. As they have shown in recent releases with artists such as Santana, Simply Red, Phil Collins, and B.B. King it doesn't get any better than Eagle Rock when it comes to the ultimate concert experience. The video image is pristine making you actually feel like you're on stage with the artists. But that's nothing compared to the audio. Not only can you hear every single instrument but you may have to turn the volume down it's that loud. Not that I'm complaining. I was hoping that Eagle Rock would release at least one of Etta James concerts at Montreaux and now they have with this release: ""Etta James Live at Montreaux 1993"". That's a little bit misleading though. Although this Blu-ray focuses on that 1993 concert, fans of Etta James get individual performances from some of her other Montreaux appearances including ones from 1975(her first appearance at Montreaux), 1977, 1978(where she sings The Eagles ""Take It to the Limit""), 1989 and 1990. Etta used the best musicians and some of these early performances feature John Paul Jones(Led Zeppelin),Rick Wakeman and jazz greats Herbie Mann and David 'Fathead' Newman. But her appearance in 1993 is the focus of this Blu-ray and she and the Roots Band give one of the best performances ever captured on film. I'm speaking from experience. I've seen Etta James in concert at least a dozen times over the years and will never forget the first time. It was in the early Eighties when she appeared at a local club in Solana Beach(Belly Up) and as soon as she came in the front door I knew she meant business. She was dressed in her black Raiders jacket and was clearly sending a message. It was a great show(a fight even broke out on the dance floor-those were the days!) Anyway, watching this new Eagle Rock Blu-ray brought back a lot of memories. For the 1993 concert she sings a heartfelt version of ""I'd Rather Go Blind"" and really rocks Montreaux with ""I Just Want to Make Love To You"". Etta James was one of the greatest singers of all time and will be missed. Sadly, we lost her last year(2012) but fans who never got the chance to see her live can feel what that was like with this superb Blu-ray from Eagle Rock. It comes highly recommended.",1375488000,3,2388,4.715311004784689
5166988,3,B008I3SDNC,"Etta James is fabulous... be aware though there is some profanity and sexual remarks throughout the performances.
She does sing away from the microphone at times, so you lose the sound.  Also, the volume goes in and out during a couple of the band performances.",1373155200,3,261,4.8
