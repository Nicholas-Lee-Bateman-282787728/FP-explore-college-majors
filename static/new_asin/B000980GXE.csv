2269829,5,B000980GXE,I LOVED this DVD.  I used this DVD for my whole pregnancy and I loved how it made me feel.  The instructor was sensitive to the limitations of pregnancy and prepared her sequences and timing accordingly.  I felt comfortable performing my yoga poses even when I was in my third trimester!  There is an excellent variety of sequences to choose from for each trimester as well as sequences for specific pregnancy symptoms.  I loved the morning sickness sequence it really helped me.  This DVD allowed me to continue to enjoy my yoga practice during my pregnancy.  I keep recommending it to all my pregnant friends who wants to practice yoga.,1132012800,6,638,4.745454545454545
2269830,5,B000980GXE,"This was a great DVD for feeling good during my pregnancy, not so much to get a sweat burning workout. I had lower back pain in my third trimester and this DVD really helped. I was able to do some other DVDs in my 2nd trimester for keeping in shape, but when I hit my third trimester this DVD was a nice friend to have around. Having a couple of blankets (or something like it) is recommended as well as a strap and block - they really help a lot.",1130112000,,447,3.977777777777778
2269831,5,B000980GXE,"I love using this DVD, it makes me feel safe doing yoga while I am pregnant.

Mary's instruction is clear and precise, and she goes into detail on how to make sure you are positioned properly for each exercise.  (There are even cut aways on alternate ways and positions to make sure you feel the most comfortable).  To me this is so worth, even if you have to pause a second until you get used to what is coming.  If you do not need assistance with some props, you do not have to use them, but I prefer to be cautious myself.

There is an extensive variety of exercises for each Trimester, and I love the fact that they are tailored for each trimester, there is even an introduction to each trimester so you know how you are changing and how the exercises are designed for you.

If you are adverse to using or considering props, or are looking for something that is  aerobic/""workout"", then I would say you should probaby not buy this DVD

If you are looking for something that will help make you feel better and is done in a safe and detailed manner, buy this DVD.

Up to you and what you are looking for.",1128556800,8,1106,4.253588516746412
2269832,5,B000980GXE,"I liked this DVD for the precise, mindful instruction overall.  Granted there were alot of props, but I think it is useful especially for first time moms that are really nervous and cautious about everything.  I found once I went through one of the workout routines several times, the props did not seem to bother me much but rather help my practice.

I really wanted to become more aware of what was happening in my body and continue to enjoy my yoga practice which I have been able to through the exercises on the DVD.

I definetely recommend this DVD.",1127174400,3,554,4.51
2269833,5,B000980GXE,"I started a little yoga after my first pregnancy and wanted to be continue to practice now that I am pregnant again, so I picked up this DVD.

It has helped me alot so far, especially compared to the first time I was pregnant.  There are separate sections for each trimester that are targeted to help with the physical issues we all experience during a particular trimester - for example in the first trimester (which I am in) there is a routine for morning sickness and another for bloating (along with another 8 or so for other issues such as headaches) and I definitely feel less affected by these problems so far and that is SO worth it to me.

The instructor is engaging and her instruction is very good.  There is also many recommended props (most of which you can substitute with things you have), and though I did not use them very often this trimester, looking forward to the next two (took a quick peak at the second and third trimester, which by the way have different models for each trimester who look to be in the actual trimester), it looks like props will be very helpful.

All in all, a great DVD and even if only one routine actually helped alleviate any issues during my pregnancy, it would have been worth it, and so far it so much more than that.",1125964800,4,1267,4.397435897435898
2269834,2,B000980GXE,I found the tape very boring to watch.  I was almost falling asleep from the monotone voice of the instructor.,1125014400,,110,4.5
2269835,5,B000980GXE,"My yoga teacher suggested I get this DVD and I like it a lot. Depending how I feel (I'm in my second trimester) I can find a work out that fits what I need. I have taken a few classes of yoga in the Iyengar style, so I am used to using props.  But as the instructor said in the prop section, you can substitute props or not even use them at all - they are just suggestions and not essential, another alternative is to just fast forward through that exercise if it doesn't work for you or youdon't feel comfortable without a prop (like a blanket or a necktie).

Although I don't use props much in my regular yoga class I went to, using them when pregnant I feel REALLY helps me experience wonderful benefits and feel safe. Sometimes the props are a pain, but in the end I find it well worth it and it is not that difficult to get ready to do a routine.

This is not so much a workout DVD as it is a DVD for helping you stay healthy and feeling good through pregnancy and prepare for birth.  If you are looking for a good workout DVD, I like Leisa Hart's FitMama Workout - between Leisa's and Mary's DVD you should be set.",1124409600,5,1120,4.077272727272727
2269836,2,B000980GXE,"I have to admit, I only tried one of the many yoga practices on this video, but I got so frustrated that I haven't even tried the others!  For a 40 minute practice, the following ""props"" were required: a minimum of 3 blankets, 2 bolster pillows, 2 regular pillows, 2 yoga blocks, a yoga strap, a sturdy chair, and a wall that you can lean against and still be able to see the television!  I felt like I spent all my time setting up, and very little time perfoming the exercises.  I wish I would have been warned before I chose this DVD.",1124236800,6,536,4.184466019417476
2269837,3,B000980GXE,"This dvd is okay for someone who has been doing yoga for a while and has plenty of yoga equipment and space in the room they choose to view the dvd.  You need a wall to lean against, a chair, several yoga bolsters, pillows, blankets, a strap, a towel.  I feel like I need to bring my entire house into the one room.  That part of the video is tough - you really have to try to find other replacements for all the props they use. I really like that there are tons of different videos to choose from.  That part of the video is wonderful.  There are so many problems pregnant women incur, so it is nice to have a variety of workouts designed specifically to many of those problems.",1123891200,4,679,4.152671755725191
2269838,5,B000980GXE,"FIVE STARS:  What I really like about this prenatal DVD is that it contains lots of routines for all three trimesters of pregnancy.  Sequences are diverse - some are long (1 hour), others short (30 minutes), some are energizing, others are restorative.  I can easily find the yoga sequence that fits my body and my mood at any particular time.  (In contrast, many other DVDs and videos have only a very few sequences.) You actually hold the poses for a good time, not just see-them-and-run. This DVD even has a section on fertility issues and pre-pregnancy yoga sequences.  Breathing exercises, which are really important for relaxation during pregnancy and for labor, are presented in a clear and practical manner.  The instructor is very engaging and compassionate; her expert instructions are detailed but not overwhelming.  I'm convinced that yoga, both the physical poses and the breathing, really help me and my baby grow in a healthy, safe and beautiful way.  A terrific  product to share with others.",1120348800,17,1008,5.024096385542169
2269859,3,B000980GXE,"There are ample routines on this dvd for your whole pregnancy. However after just 3 different poses I shut it off. First you need a lot of gear, bolters, blocks, straps etc, so setting up for each pose takes too much time, The deep stretches were great , but I was using pillows etc. Also, there are poses cut into each  segment, it isn't a continuous flow which is what I am used to and prefer.",1207267200,,395,4.197368421052632
2269860,3,B000980GXE,There were so many props used in this video it was hard to keep up with them all. If you like a video that you can just pick up and use this is not the one for you.,1177891200,2,164,3.3421052631578947
2269861,3,B000980GXE,I was disappointed when I tried using this DVD.  I am Not saying that the Yoga was not effective or professional.  I am saying that the numerous props (about 3-6 per pose) and the 'choppy' workouts (no transition phases between poses) were very distracting and burdensome.  I normally never leave negative feedback.  I decided to do so when I realized that with two children money can be limited and I wanted to save someone their money because there are alot better videos 'out there'.  Good Luck.,1176076800,6,498,4.744186046511628
2269862,2,B000980GXE,"Before I entered my second trimester I was a runner and did pilates and yoga on a regular basis.  I bought this DVD to keep active and prepare for labor, but I don't think I will be able to use it at all.  It is too slow and there is too much explination (the instructor never stops explaining so you can't relax into a pose).

This DVD will be great for someone who has never done yoga before or didn't work out regularly before pregnancy, not for somebody who was already familiar with yoga or in great shape.

My biggest compliant is the extensive use of props and in between every pose you have to get up, get the props set up and even change position of your yoga mat!!  I have never done a yoga routine before where I had to get up between poses and move my mat!!",1171843200,3,769,4.1
2269863,4,B000980GXE,"I really enjoyed this dvd.  I prefer something a little more dynamic at times, but this was great for those days that I just liked to do something a little more on the chill side.  I loved the different sections and modifications for the different trimesters.  I could really pick what I wanted to do and how long.",1171238400,,314,4.379310344827586
2269864,5,B000980GXE,"This is the only pre-natal video I can confidently recommend to my pre-natal yoga students.  The instruction is very clear and detailed, and great care has been taken to ensure that the poses and sequencing are healthy and safe for pregnant women.

I find that many students, even once they are pregnant, think that they have to have a fast and intense ""work-out"" in order to accomplish goals of health and fitness.  They have trouble slowing down to a reasonable pace.  This video allows women to practice opening up and preparing for labor, delivery and motherhood.

Once you practice the poses once or twice, you will easily get the hang of using the props -- if you are new to supported poses, you will love them!

The sequences in the DVD can be sequenced easily depending on the kind of practice you are looking for and how far aong you are in your pregnancy.

Remember that you must have a balanced practice -- building strength for carrying that baby around and also opening up to your changing body (and your baby).  This dvd allows time for quiet reflection -- a key component of effective mothering.

Buy it!",1171152000,9,1119,4.6395939086294415
2269865,4,B000980GXE,"I like that there are lots of specific workouts on here, but I found there was a lot of set up (like others mentioned).  At times I had the patience for the set up, other timed I didn't have the patience and just skipped to the next pose that was easy and minimal set up.  I found the workouts to be longer than I like, I as hoping for quick 20-30 min sections, but most seem to be 50-60 mins.  I just recently realised they also had info on breathing during labor, which I was glad to see and will try their suggestions.",1168992000,,521,4.038834951456311
2269866,2,B000980GXE,"I wasn't able to use much, it seemed to go way too fast for a pregant lady. I'm a beginner yoga person, maybe someone more advanced would benefit from this dvd more.",1168300800,,165,4.1875
2269867,5,B000980GXE,"I cannot say enough great things about this DVD! My experience with pregnancy was not the roses and sunshine image portrayed in the movies. Everything was fine and I would do it again in a heartbeat, but I was sick for the first 6 months and had a lot of hip, pelvic, and back pain. This DVD was my saving grace. There are different routines and sections for each trimester. Within each trimester, there are routines to help with various problems you may be having (nausea, back and hip pain, sleep problems, etc.) There is even a section to prepare for childbirth. The setups with props are well worth it, the time I spent in these poses were the most comfortable moments of my day. I also give a lot of credit to an easy [...] delvery with no complications to the yoga. There are lots of poses to help widen the birth canal, and help baby be in the right position. You can even choose to just do breathing and relaxation exercises. This can be great if you've had a stressful day. The music and soothing voice are great. I began to feel relaxed when I heard the music. The instructor's narration is nice too. She talks about your baby and really helps you to feel connected with them.
It was really the best purchase I made, and I loan mine to every pregnant person I know.",1164672000,,1275,4.361344537815126
2269868,5,B000980GXE,"Truly ""complete"" as the title suggests--with many different sequences for each trimester so you never get bored.

Soothing but professional voice and music.  Watchable, basic photography and design. Poses are very clearly explained, with detailed reminders about alignment.  Particularly good for those of us who like Iyengar-based yoga.  I contacted the publishing company with a question and the got back to me immediately--really care about their products.  A strong and gracious companion throughout all the stages of pregnancy.",1162252800,2,532,5.769230769230769
2269879,1,B000980GXE,"Unless you like yoga that has no flow whatsoever.  There is a cut (in the editing) after each pose, and all of the poses seem to require a lengthy set up with a multitude of annoying props.  I was VERY disappointed with my purchase.  Yoga shouldn't be this irritating.  Try  Gaiam's prenatal yoga with Shiva Rey.",1160524800,4,312,4.5
2269880,4,B000980GXE,"I wanted to keep in shape during my pregnancy, so my husband bought me this dvd. There is a lot of equipment to use, but it's definately helping! It's not boring like the other ones I've tried because there are different sections for breathing and lower back pain. Just set up everything you need before hand, and it's a great DVD to use throughout your pregnancy!",1147132800,4,364,4.53030303030303
2269881,2,B000980GXE,"I was looking for a beginning prenatal yoga tape, to help with relaxation and stretching, and I was very excited when my husband purchased this DVD for me as a gift.  At first glance this DVD looked great, with so many options directed at specific issues (like morning sickness, rejuvination, etc...).  However, when I tried a few of the routines I quickly became frustrated.  They required multiple rolled blankets, pillows, mats, chairs, wall surfaces etc... and even once I had the set-up complete, the exercise only lasted 3 minutes before another, completely different set-up, using different props, was required.  Because I am new to yoga, perhaps my expectations were off - but every yoga class I've been to required minimal equipment, which is one of the reasons I liked it.  I would not recommend this DVD unless you have a dedicated exercise space, as well as the right equipment and a strong previous knowledge of yoga.",1142899200,29,930,4.935897435897436
2269882,2,B000980GXE,"I take a prenatal yoga class and bought this tape to supplement my weekly class.  I find the tape very hard to follow and there are too many props (pillows, etc.) I would not recommend it especailly if you are not familiar with yoga.",1142208000,10,233,4.295454545454546
2269883,4,B000980GXE,"I am used to a flow yoga so when I first did this DVD I found it a bit slow at points. But now that I have slowed down and observed what the teacher was saying I really grew to appreciate it. I guess there are times in life to flow and move to get strong and times to go more inward to connect with this unique, transformative time in life. I definitely recommend this for people that want to really listen and understand the changes you are going through.",1140825600,3,456,4.0777777777777775
2269884,2,B000980GXE,"I have been practicing yoga for several years and never in my life (pregnant or not) have I ever spent so much time with set up. There was no flow to this program, every position required folded blankets, bolsters, straps and no sooner was I in the position then the screen faded and moved to the next position with a chair placed over a sticky mat with two bolsters on it. My husband was scrambling to help me place the props and finally I was so fed up that I couldn't continue it! I have ordered a different prenatal DVD and hopefully I will have an easier time of it.",1139875200,12,571,4.2

2269886,5,B000980GXE,"DVD has such precise instruction and uses many props, actually caught me by surprise.  Tons of programs for each trimester and I cannot say enough positive things about this DVD.  For beginners it is amazing, and for the more advance I would say it is a welcome change for those who want a slower pace and as one moves into the third trimester.",1135728000,4,344,4.444444444444445
2269887,4,B000980GXE,"I have purchased another DVD from this company in the past so I knew to expect that it wouldn't be as fast paced as some other videos.  I really enjoyed using it on the days where I didn't feel that I had the energy to do a more intense workout.  There were lots of props required, but many of them were ones you have around.  She gives you lots of time to set them up between moves.",1134604800,,383,3.948051948051948
2269888,3,B000980GXE,"If you are experienced at yoga at all, then you really don't need this DVD. However if you are looking for very exact asana descriptions given at a very slow pace (even for the first trimester routines), then this is the DVD for you. This is very good for beginning students, but the instruction is a bit choppy. She will suddenly be in mountain pose again after finishing a pose. I found myself fast-forwarding through the first routine just to see what might be next, then I did the pose several times on each side before the DVD moved on to the next pose. (It takes a while for her to get done talking you through the pose -- which may be helpful to some.) You really don't need all the props, especially if you have some knowledge of yoga and also some flexibility. I just didn't use any props. She doesn't believe that you are capable of doing full poses, which is great for those who can't, because she is very certain to incorporate the wall, a chair, a block, and/or a blanket (or three) to supplement. To get some ideas of possible pregnancy routines, I think it is better to just borrow this DVD from the library or rent it for a month or two with a mail order DVD program. Another reviewer said that she is a little boring. I think her calm (or slow) pace could certainly come off that way.",1134432000,4,1301,4.314285714285714
8058161,5,B000980GXE,"I absolutely love the stretches on this DVD. The headache section has helped me so much with my first trimester tension headaches. And there are separate routines for first trimester morning sickness, general relaxation, energizing. I look forward to using this DVD for my entire pregnancy.

The 'narrator' gives wonderfully clear instructions for each stretch & helps with reminders for good posture, continuing to breathe, etc. throughout each stretch. Very easy to follow!

8058164,3,B000980GXE,"There are 8-10 yoga routines and breathing exercises for each trimester.  It has routines specifically targeted to help you with specific pregnancy problems like backache, nausea, and insomnia.  It also has routines to prepare you for labor.  The downside is that the flow is poor (one routine wants the mat parallel to the wall, the next wants it perpendicular, and then back to parallel, etc.) and many props are required (strap, blocks, chairs, LOTS of pillows & blankets).  Expect to need to pause frequently to get everything set up. In my first pregnancy, this was the only prenatal yoga DVD I used so I thought that all of these props and modifications were necessary to make it safe.

I also like that you spend time in each pose & can really feel the benefits of the pose, rather than some routines that quickly rush through different poses.  However, in their efforts to keep the pregnant body safe, the creators of this DVD have gone overboard in their modifications.  EVERY pose requires some sort of prop & some require several props.  It really takes me out of the routine to have to set up for every pose & I don't have some of the props or appropriate substitutions.

This DVd requires more than a mat a pillow and a blanket and in my current class these are the only three things they require. I watched it one or two times and got demotivated after that.

For each trimester there were several options you could choose depending on your ailment (headache, backache, drowsiness, etc...) and the amount of time you had to do yoga.  Each option was broken up into a segment for each pose.  The pace was slow but you got a lot of stretch out of each pose.  It was so relaxing & it really did help relieve some ailments.
I also had a very easy delivery compared to others.  It was painful, but fairly quick & I truly believe that yoga had a lot to do with the quick pace of my labor because I was able to work with the pain & I was in shape for delivery.
I recommend this video to all of my pregnant friends!",1215043200,2,705,4.116788321167883
