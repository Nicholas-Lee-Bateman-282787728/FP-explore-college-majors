567682,5,6303120474,"The Valley Of Decision is one of those sprawling, episodic, all-star novel-based dramas that were done so well in the 1940s, like How Green Was My Valley, I Remember Mama, Adam Had Four Sons, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, Keys Of The Kingdom, etc.  As in those films, the excellent performances of almost every actor enhances the dramatic impact of the film.  It's about the daughter (Greer Garson) of a disabled, embittered steal mill worker (Lionel Barrymore) who goes to work as a maid for her father's ex-boss, Donald Crisp (A Dog Of Flanders, How Green Was My Valley) the owner of the Scott Steal Mill.  While employed at the big house, she falls in love with one of his sons (Gregory Peck).  After years of working up to it, it looks like they'll finally end up married - until a violent labor dispute involving the two fathers drives a wedge between the families.

Of course Crisp and Barrymore are perfect in their roles, as well as Garson and Peck, but the whole film rises another notch due to the cast surrounding them, including Dan Duryea (Ball Of Fire, Flight Of The Phoenix), Marsha Hunt (The Human Comedy, Chloe's Prayer), Marshall Thompson (The Basketball Fix, Daktari), Galdys Cooper (The Bishop's Wife, The Secret Garden, Etc.), Dean Stockwell (Down To The Sea In Ships, Quantum Leap), Preston Foster (Ramrod, Tomahawk, etc.), Reginald Owen (Kim, Five Weeks In A Balloon, Mary Poppins, etc.), Jessica Tandy (The Birds, Batteries Not Included), and Arthur Shields (who was Barry Fitzgerald's brother), and others.  It's primarily because of the cast that I give The Valley Of Decision 5 stars.",1129507200,10,1607,4.868131868131868
567683,4,6303120474,"This 1945 black and white classic, set in Victorian Philadelphia, highlights the class struggle in America at the time of the steel strikes, capitalism vs. the unions, as workers seek to establish collective bargaining for fair wages and safe working conditions. Long before the strike begins, the Scott family enjoys a luxurious lifestyle, scions of the Scott Steel Mills. Mary Rafferty comes into the home as a servant, but eldest son, Paul (Gregory Peck), falls in love with the beautiful Irish woman (Greer Garson). Blind to their class differences, Paul pursues Mary. Equally in love, but unsure, Mary crosses the ocean to London, where she works for one of the Scott daughters. Eventually Mary is convinced to return and marry Paul.

Unfortunately, before they can wed, the strike turns violent, the steel mill closed down for lack of settlement. Mary talks Scott Sr. into meeting with the workers, but before an agreement can be made, strikebreakers arrive on the scene and in the ensuing mayhem Mr. Scott and Mary's agitator father (Lionel Barrymore) are killed. Afterwards, Mary refuses to marry Paul, burdened by the curse her father put on the match and their future children.

Time passes and Paul marries his childhood sweetheart and has a son, but the marriage is a bitter failure, Paul's wife a rigid snob with no regard for her husband's love of the mills. Over the years, the widowed Mrs. Scott has secretly visited Mary Rafferty, unwilling to turn away from the woman she has grown to love as one of the family. The mill falls on hard times and after Mrs. Scott's death, her shares of the company are left to Mary. Although the romance is the crux of the film and the lovers do finally reunite, the background of social change in the mills and the attendant brutality of the worker's struggle reveals the deep division of wealth and poverty.

This film is notable in 1945 for addressing social issues, albeit those of the Victorian Age. The message is clear, as played out when the children vote to sell the mill their father founded: return to the earth what it has given so freely. The hubris of the upper class is a given, their easy acceptance of their birthright unchallenged. But Mary infuses a bit of authenticity into a family whose bloodlines have been weakened by privilege. Mary is the voice of the people and it is she who helps them understand their legacy. Her union with the socially conscious Paul Scott would bridge the gap between classes, although the power remains where it always has, with the Scott's. Steel mills are obsolete in today's economy; for that reason alone, the film is a grim reminder of the production of resources on American soil and employment for anyone willing to work.

567684,5,6303120474,"Greer Garson picked up one of long string of Oscar nominations for this film (losing to Joan Crawford, of all people, for Mildred Pierce).  While I wasn't entirely convinced of the romantic chemistry between Garson and Gregory Peck, I think her nomination was well-deserved for other reasons, including her handling of an Irish accent (Garson was not Irish born, as she claimed through much of her life, but British) and her deft portrayal of a relatively complex character, Mary Rafferty.  Garson developed a sort of mini-specialty playing bright, attractive, working-class women, and few other film actresses have pulled off this combination as successfully as she did (Meryl Streep, Susan Sarandon, and British actresses such as Julie Walters being examples of some who have).  Garson also makes the most of what might be called Mary's ""fatal flaw""--the high-minded stubbornness that nearly destroys her chance at love.

Peck's performance was (unsurprisingly) good too, though I don't consider this one of his best films.  To me, Peck always seems more convincing in man-on-a-mission type roles (Atticus Finch, etc.) than in romantic leads.  But he does have several moving scenes in which he fights to save his father's steel mill from labor strife and his wastrel siblings.

An extra-special treat in this movie is a very young Jessica Tandy, playing Peck's selfish wife, Lucille.  Tandy brings poignancy and raw emotional power to the small role.

A worthwhile MGM classic.",1104451200,38,1480,5.263829787234043
567685,5,6303120474,"I found this movie as it was just rolling opening credits, it was near 4am and i had work the next day! Dont you know i gostuck on this adventure until i saw the final credits passing by??

Gregory Peck plays the smart, proper brother, mixed in with a family of various types of characters, he plays his role great right to the very end!

One thing i don't understand is how he (peck) ends up marrying someone who in the beginning he made it clear he did not want to marry. This goes against peck's character traits in the movie to do a ""oh well i guess i will marry you then ..."" type of move, he appeared to have way more class than that. But it all works out perfectly in the end and i was thrilled with the ending.

This may throw my review under a truck, but i think this may be the very first black and white film i haev ever watched, and liked!

The story was just beautiful, and it was layed out so nicely.

I have come to buy this movie so i can watch it again with my grandmother, i just know she will love it!",1093824000,16,1020,3.980392156862745
567686,3,6303120474,"Ladies, Ladies, PLEASE!!  Please stop this bickering.  My fellow reviewer, ""Shadow Lady"" (see below), is about ready to explode a gasket with her disdain and contempt for the lovely Miss Garson.  ""Shadow"" paints much too bleek a picture while her lowly peer, Little Miss Proper (""Princess Incognita"") has sugar coated Greer's character into a sticky little marshmellow of misinformation.  The definitive opinion (my own, of course) is the important one, and is somewhere in between.
First of all, this movie has a disturbing pagan slant that could be quite offensive to devout religious types like myself. Surprisingly frequent references to ""witchhunting"" and the Dark Ages.  Basic storyline: A steel tycoon's son (Gregory the ""impeccable peckerhead"" Peck) loves the family maid who just happens to be an Irish steelworker's daughter!  And WOW, the setting is even ""Victorian"" Pittsburgh, PA in the late 1800's!
Ranting and raving is the predominant rule of thumb as Greer's Daddy (a crusty old codger clucking away in his wheel chair) throws one hissy fit after another.  ""I'm reachin' into high heaven to put the curse on this marriage"" (it's a bit complicated, but he's madder than a hornet's nest that the steel workers' demand of a 5 cent per hour raise has fallen upon deaf ears)!  Peck's rich and reasonable father seems hellbent on resolving the conflict until one day (in a peculiar and nutty twist) he is gunned down in broad daylight.  All he said was, ""We Scotts cannot live without belching chimney's anymore than you can.""  For crying out loud. His subsequent and imminent demise was quite unexpected, I must say.
The film alternates between a hopelessly naive romance and nasty hillbilly feuding.  An occasional dose of sharp dialogue is overshadowed by the cantankerous.  Or as one hapless victim proclaimed, ""For once in your life, will you just keep your mouth shut!""  Oh shucks, another predictable cliche!  Why, there's even the occasional ""shuffling Negro"" (""That's right, Sir!"") which may be a bit perturbing to some.  Fortunately, the first half of this film has its moments of brilliance but it flickers, and then eventually fades.",1032393600,9,2156,5.12
567687,5,6303120474,"Contrary to what one reviewer thought, Greer Garson played the character to perfection.  She was every bit the character that Davenport created in her book, on which this film is based.  And ""annoying, uppity and full of herself"" is exactly the opposite of the role that Garson portrays.  See the movie and you'll see.  As for chemistry in the film...it's beautiful.  I couldn't imagine any other leads other than Peck and Garson.  I totally recommend the book too!  After you see the movie, you'll want to see what happens next.  And so much more happens!",971568000,28,556,4.778947368421052
567688,2,6303120474,"There is no chemistry to speak of between Garson and Peck in this boring, snoozefest of a movie. The idea of them being in love is absurd and they  should never have been cast together romantically. What was Hollywood  thinking? Every character is a walking cliche and the plot is entirely  predictable. Predictability can be good, but in this case it's just another  reason to dislike it strongly. Garson's character is annoying, uppity and  full of herself (what a stretch *snarkle*). She's just one of those  holier-than-thou type of people who think they're better than everyone else  and I wanted to slap her around 'til I knocked her delusions of grandeur  out of her. I'm sure this is not how her character was supposed to come  off, but that was the impression that I got. How could anyone want her to  be happy and get her man? No guy as hot as Paul (GP's character) deserves  such an awful woman as his wife! The only thing that saved this movie from  being a total waste of time was Gregory Peck. Besides being a young,  handsome gentleman in this film, he gave a great performance and his effort  to save a disaster of a movie deserves two stars, and know that both stars  are for him and no other part of the movie. And people actually gave this 5  stars? Oh boy!",965088000,5,1276,4.458874458874459
567689,5,6303120474,"This was one of those films that I found on TV about midway through, and was instantly hooked.  After that, I just HAD to see the whole thing, so I bought the video, a box of kleenex, and then the book.
This film is  wonderful...One of my ultimate favorites!  This was the first time I had  seen Greer Garson and I thought she was wonderful.  Gregory Peck was  perfect, of course!  He a rich steelmill owners' son, she a poor Irish  housemaid.  They fall in love, but can they ever be together?
I  absolutely love the ending to this film. I can't tell you...you have to see  it, but that's what prompted me to buy the book.  I wanted to see what else  happens!  I confess that I prefer the movie adaptation over the book, but  the movie only covers about a third of what the book has to tell.

The movie won 5 Academy awards, it is a wonderful story about the steel industry, the role unions played, and depicts the struggle to make a living for immigrants at this time.  I lived briefly in PA. at a time when the big steel companies offered great jobs to people and much prosperity to the area.

567813,5,6303120474,"I saw thus film many years ago, but the story is wonderfully compelling.  Greer Garson started her film career in her 30's and that is very old for an actress. She starts out in the film as a cleaning/washer woman in the hotel where she meets Greg Peck. The character actors are all ones that we all old-film lovers will recognize:  Agnes Moorehead (who speaks with a French accent) and Donald Crisp, Lionel Barrymore, and Marsha Hunt (as the wife of Peck who will not allow Peck to marry Greer Garson (Marsha's character wants Peck's money.)  In the end the couple leaves the Pennsylvania town together in a horse and buggy.  There's lots of action and a shooting!  Don't want to be a spoiler, but the story is wonderful (in a soap opera way). Enjoy the film!",1487203200,,760,4.518248175182482

567859,3,6303120474,"I read this wonderful book when I was 19 years old. At age 73 I can admit to rereading it at least three more times. My very favorite love story. So much better than the movie. If you like a multi-generation,.historical novel packed with characters you'll love it. I,d love to see PBS do this one. The book covers 1880 to WW 2. The movie ends too soon. I'm reading the book again. Would love Julian Fellowes of Downton Abbey fame to take on this project. So many great characters. Rich American history of Steel Industry and of course the bittersweet love story of Mary and Paul. Done right and sticking to the book this could be an epic movie or series. I have just read so many glowing reviews of this movie that it prompts me to say you don't know what you're missing by not ready the book. It is so much more to love. Mary and Paul's love story ohhhhh so different when they can't be together because Wm. Scott and James Rafferty are both killed Mary encourages Paul to marry Louise Kane because she knows it could only be a marriage of convenience. Clarrisa Scott loves Mary so that she sends her to take care of Constance . When Paul confides in his father how much he loves Mary they send for her to return .Marriage plans begin until fateful labor mtg. when both men are shot in steel yard .The book is so packed with sub plots twists and turns. Constance twin brother Edgar unknowingly gets involved with Bridget ,Mary's streetwalker sister. If you love this movie you must treat yourself to reading the book and then you'll feel robbed that it left out so much. I would love to see a remake along the lines of Downton Abbey. I think it's that worthy.p.s. I found the book on Amazon years ago. I was given the book to read by a friends mother in 1960. I've probably read it five times at different stages of my life.

568180,4,6303120474,"""The Valley of Decision"" (1945) is a fine example of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""prestige"" approach to filmmaking during the golden age of Hollywood's studio system, and it benefits from an excellent cast that combines established stars and future luminaries.  This story of management-labor tensions in 1870's Pittsburgh comes from Marcia Davenport's 1942 bestseller, an epic novel (640 pages, in a recent University of Pittsburgh Press reprint), and it was characteristic of MGM to want to turn a bestselling and critically praised saga into a lavishly produced feature film.

The original novel covers the period from the Panic of 1873 to the Second World War, but the film only has time to set forth the first part of that epic story.  At the center of the narrative is Mary Rafferty (played by Greer Garson), a plucky young woman, daughter of a steelworking family in Pittsburgh's riverside flats.  When she accepts employment as a domestic in the home of the Scotts, the wealthy industrial family that owns and runs the local steel mill, her decision outrages her father Pat Rafferty (played by Lionel Barrymore), a longtime steelworker who was badly injured in an industrial accident at the Scott steel mills, and still blames the Scotts for the mishap that lost him the use of his legs.  But Mary's decision to work in the Scott home introduces her, and us, to the members of the Scott family.  Notable among the Scotts are patriarch William Scott (played by Donald Crisp), a man whose austere exterior conceals an open mind and a kind heart, and his wise and perceptive wife Clarissa (played by Gladys Cooper).  Of greatest interest to Mary, however, is the Scotts' industrious and forward-thinking son Paul (played by a young Gregory Peck).  The rapport between the two is immediate, and draws the notice, and the disapproval, of Louise Kane (played by Jessica Tandy), a privileged young woman who considers Paul hers by right, but has never really asked herself whether she loves Paul as a person.  These romantic complications take place against a background of industrial tension; the film begins in 1873, the year of a post-Civil War economic panic that ravaged American industry, and disagreements between the Scotts and their employees eventually reach a boiling point, in large part because of the still-angry Pat Rafferty's machinations.

One of the strengths of this film is the way in which it casts each of its stars, both established and emerging, in roles that accord well with each actor's screen persona.  Greer Garson, one of the pre-eminent actresses of her time, is excellent as Mary Rafferty (even if her Irish accent sometimes seems uneven); as with her Academy Award-winning work in William Wyler's ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942), she portrays a brave and plucky woman who is equal to any crisis and never loses her moral compass.  Gregory Peck is comparably excellent as Paul Scott, the young industrialist with new ideas.  Many moviegoers of this era are used to thinking of Peck as the craggy, incorruptible Atticus Finch from ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962), and it is good to have this reminder of the first-rate work that Peck was doing early in his career (this film was released in the same year in which he appeared with Ingrid Bergman in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"").  Donald Crisp, a veteran character actor who turned in dependable work in film after film (he was the disapproving father of Henry Jekyll's lady-love in Victor Fleming's 1941 film version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde""), captures both William Scott's autocratic tendencies and his growing willingness to accept change.  Lionel Barrymore, in a role that anticipates his work as Mr. Potter in Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), seethes as the embittered and revenge-minded Pat Rafferty, forever nursing his injuries and his grievances.  Gladys Cooper brings to the role of Clarissa Scott the same serenity and grace that marked her portrayal of Henry Higgins's mother in George Cukor's ""My Fair Lady"" (1964).  And a young Jessica Tandy, as Louise Kane, creates well a character that looks ahead to her roles as Lydia Brenner in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" (1963) and Daisy Werthan in Bruce Beresford's ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989) -- an intense woman who holds high social station but is not secure in it.  There is even a young Dean Stockwell, in his first role as Paul and Louise's son Paulie.  This industrial epic is truly rich in stars.

MGM, as mentioned above, was renowned for painstaking detail in areas like art direction, set decoration, and costume design, and ""The Valley of Decision"" recreates well the world of 1870's Pittsburgh.  It is also interesting to note how the film reflects the values and cultural tensions of 1940's America.  Davenport published her novel in 1942, in the midst of World War II, at a time when writers and other artists generally emphasized unity rather than division within an American society that was fighting to preserve democracy.  This 1945 film, released as the war was grinding to a conclusion, makes similar artistic choices in favor of American democratic capitalism by showing both labor and management, during the crucial conflict, as being composed of people of goodwill who would have found a reasonable solution, but for the machinations of one angry man.

Some elements of the film may seem thoroughly in accordance with genre conventions -- the budding romance between Mary and Paul, for example.  Yet the film also brings forth its fair share of genuinely surprising plot twists, right up through a conclusion that seems quite daring for an example of Production Code-era cinema.  If you like old-fashioned epic cinema that sets romance amid the sweep of history, or if you're a Western Pennsylvania native or resident with a healthy interest in the history and culture of your region, then you may find ""The Valley of Decision"" a pleasant place to spend a couple of hours.",1358467200,3,5940,5.035714285714286

568185,5,6303120474,"This film stands up to multiple re-viewings, being well done with quality actors.  It is a very early entry of Gregory Peck, the ""fair-haired"" newcomer they rushed to the screen, for obvious reasons.  It is not unlike Fox's handling of Tyrone Power, whom they began starring almost immediately.  It certainly worked in Peck's case, his holding up with the many veterans in this one.  ""Maid Mary"" is quite endearing as the lower born young woman of greater inner quality than her higher born contemporaries.  Greer Garson has played similar roles to this, to equal good effect.  Without her contribution to the family, it would have sunk much lower than some of them did.  The wastrel son who failed in his simple commission to stop the strike breakers should have been disinherited, but unfortunately since his dereliction contributed largely to his father's demise, that couldn't have happened.

It does represent a saga, so its length should not surprise, their choices of inclusions being basically the main threads.  Many themes are familiar, but workable since they tend to life - the empire builder having spoiled, consumption oriented children (with the exception of the oldest, Paul), the senselessness of the feud maintained by Rafferty, the fitness of those less advantaged.  While there are frustrating examples of wasted lives, there is also gratification of relationship.  I especially enjoyed Mary and Mrs. Scott's ongoing closeness and friendship.  Rather than grasp at what the rich people have, Mary actually excluded herself from marriage to the heir as inappropriate for her.  However, she was rewarded despite her own assessment of her ineligibility and the end gratifies one's hope for the strongly matched couple.",1357084800,2,1735,5.242753623188406

Plus the wife of course who was just bitter because he didn't love her. I couldn't quite believe that either of Paul's parents would think it was perfectly alright for him to marry a servant - not in that day and time.  And, I couldn't believe that any girl truly in love as she said she was would swallow a lot of crap about a curse on her unborn children if she married him. Instead of saying to herself ""I didn't get his father killed, his drunken son and my crazy father did"".  Instead of staying to help Paul through it she runs off for two years leaving him to fall into the hands of the bitch neighbor. The best things in it were the daughter of the family and her mother. All in all it had the feel of a mish mash of a story without an awful lot of point or action. Of course the fact that Gregory Peck has the sex appeal of a celery stalk didn't help things.

It is about Mary Rafferty who falls in love with Paul Scott while she is a maid for his rich family. The Scotts run a large mill. She tries to deny that she's in love but eventually get engaged to him. But trouble takes over at the mill. The workers are upset with the Scotts and Mary's father backs them. He has never liked the Scotts, much less his only daughter marrying one. The Scotts are going to get strike breakers to dismantle the violent gang of workers until Mary makes an agreement with the workers to put off the strike breakers if they can discuss a compromise. The workers agree. The strike breakers are already coming, so one of the Scotts (a brother?) is sent to call them off. But he gets drunk and doesn't call the strike breakers off. The Scotts and workers have met at a bridge to make an agreement until they see the strike breakers coming. Mary's father tells the workers to attack and shoots Mr. Scott. Someone shoots him. Mary is devastated and tells Paul that they can never be happy together and calls off their engagement. Years later, Paul is married to an old sweetheart. They have a son but aren't in love. Mary visits the mother, who is very endeared to her from the time when Mary was her employee. The mother dies. There is a reading of the mill. The shares for the mill are divided into like 5 or 4 parts-including Mary. One of the brothers wants to sell the mill-the only catch is that all share holders have to agree. Mary doesn't agree because she knows that the deceased mom wouldn't want it that way. She ends up convincing enough of them not to sell. She is leaving when Paul hurries to catch up and rides home with her. It is insinuated that mary may finally settle for happiness with Paul.

568249,4,6303120474,"I have discovered that a lot of the movies out of the archive collection feature themes about class conflicts and socialism versus capitalism issues.  This movie is one that has some class conflict elements.  Greer Garson is an Irish girl who is capable and intelligent.  Her father bears a life-long grudge against the owner of the local steel mill wherein he lost the use of his legs.  Although, the owners actually treated him fairly throughout the whole ordeal, he is consumed by his hatred towards the owners and everything their kind represent.  He lobbies constantly for a Union and strikes.  So when his daughter (Greer Garson) gets a job working as a domestic maid in the house of the owners of the mill, he is less than pleased.  However, money beckons and she goes to work for the owner in spite of his misgivings.  To her surprise she finds the owners are not the devil himself as she was raised to think and they end up respecting her for her good work ethic.  Eventually she and the owner's son (as portrayed by Gregory Peck) fall in-love and he even asks her to marry him.  However, Greer Carson's character can't shake her Irish superstitions and the notions of her childhood and so she turns him down.  Had the movie ended there I would have given it five stars.  However, it continues on to show the unhappy marriage of Gregory Peck's character with a local socialite.  And in a somewhat cruel treatment of her, eventually we are led to believe that Gregory Peck's character and Greer Garson's character finally end up together.

Probably one of the highlights of the movie is actually seeing Gregory Peck in such a debonair and dashing role.  One which he  pulls off well.  However, I'm just uncomfortable with the way they toss out the socialite wife and so I think this movie is good but not excellent.",1289606400,4,1823,4.646875

568255,4,6303120474,"Hello,
I would like to say that I have looked for this movie in DVD everywhere. Now I have found it, it is a good movie, with a good quality picture and a good sound. But it has no subtitles? How is it possible nowadadays no to have subtitles on a DVD?? So the hearing impaired cannot see it? right?
I would like the editors to think about editing it on other countries like France, Italy, Spain because a lot of people like my French mother would like to see it in French, and that my mother doesn't understand English. In France this movie is no more edited, it is immpossible to find it!!! and it is impossible to find it otherwise than in English imported from the USA because it is only edited in the USA.
My mother had seen it in 1945 in France in French and later had found only the book by Marcia Davenport in French but not the movie, that She regrets! It is a fantastic movie!!!
I have found it for only in English and without subtitles neither English nor other languages!! what a shame in 2010!!",1280793600,3,1007,4.22279792746114

568289,5,6303120474,"Greer Garson and a very young Gregory Peck star in this excellent movie. Peck plays Paul Scott, the son of a wealthy steel mill owner. He falls for the new maid, Mary Rafferty (Garson), in spite of the efforts of his friend and neighbor played by Jessica Tandy. Another obstacle to the relationship is Mary's father, who is a bitter cripple since he was disabled in an accident in the mill and wants his daughter to have nothing to do with the wealthy Scott family. She, however,  persists in working for them, and endears herself to the entire family.

When the mill workers go on strike Mary tries to help mend things, but the situation turns ugly. She blames herself, leaving the Scott home and refusing to communicate with Paul.

Years pass and Paul's siblings want to sell the mill. Paul's mother had forseen such a time and had left Mary in an interesting position, which allows her to influence the situation.

I'm not sure if you could say this movie has a ""happily-ever-after"" ending, but it is satisfying. The story is interesting and the acting is top-notch. This is one of my favorite classics with two of my favorite classic actors.

Just a word of warning, if you didn't notice in the product description, this is a DVD-R, which is burned on demand--it is not the same process used to produce most commercial DVDs. Though I have purchased several of these types of movies from the Warner Archive and had no problems, the most recent one I bought is very touchy about playing in my DVD player. Sometimes it plays fine, other times I can't get the player to read the disc. The company warns that these discs may not play in DVD player/recorders, which mine is not, and most of these movies have worked fine, but you need to be aware of this when you order. If your only DVD player is also a recorder, this may not be your best option.",1275264000,70,1846,4.514970059880239
568290,5,6303120474,"Having lived for a short time in a coal mining town and later a town with a steel plant (in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia) I could easily relate to the story. It held a lot of authenticity regarding the steel making process, and the lives of the workers.

The social stratification was still apparent in the hierarchy of the steel plant (and community) that I lived in in Cape Breton.

The movie has captured the lives of the workers perfectly as 'The salt of The Earth' as they toil for a rich owner who is at odds with the Union. When the maid falls in love with the Steel Plant Owner`s son, the story ignites into a passionate love story which , as it reaches a climax will leave a lot of viewers teary eyed.

This is a Classic story, and the acting is superb . It reminds the viewer how great the actors in those days were. I highly recommend it.",1274832000,6,845,4.203703703703703

568294,5,6303120474,"Thank goodness for libraries!.  Our local public library offers literally thousands of movies in both the VHS and DVD formats.  My wife and I enjoy the movies of the 1940's and 1950's and each weekend we pick up 3 or 4 films.  This past weekend we got a chance to view a film neither one of us had ever heard of.  ""The Valley of Decision"" is a 1945 film starring a very young Gregory Peck as Paul Scott and the lovely Greer Garson as Mary Rafferty.

The plot of ""The Valley of Decision"" revolves around Mary's decision to accept a job as a housekeeper at the home of the owner of the local steel mill.  Mary's father Pat (played by Lionel Barrymore) is outraged when he hears the news.  Pat Rafferty is a bitter old man was paralyzed as the result of an  accident at the mill and  blames the Scott family for his misfortune.  Despite her fathers strong objections Mary goes to work at the Scott family compound.  Shes need the job!
The Scott's quickly become quite fond of the sweet and vivacious Mary and  begin to treat her as a member of the family.  Mary becomes especially close to Mrs. Scott (Gladys Cooper).  Upon his return from a business trip overseas young Paul Scott meets Mary and falls head over heels for her.  The feeling was mutual.  About a year later Paul proposes to Mary.  Despite her deep love for Paul she was totally unprepared to handle the situation. Given her social status Mary feels unworthy and believes that  it would be totally inappropriate for her to accept his proposal.  Rather, she chooses to accept an offer to move to England to serve as a housekeeper for Paul's sister Constance and her husband.  Mary  leaves town without even saying goodbye to Paul.  Paul is crushed and cannot stop thinking about her.

Several years later Mary returns to Pittsburgh at the behest of Mr. Scott who has discovered for the first time how his son feels about Mary.  It turns out that Mr. Scott  has absolutely no objections to such a marriage.  So much wasted time!  Upon her return there is trouble brewing at the mill. The plant has been closed by a bitter strike and now the company is considering bringing in strikebreakers.  Knowing people on both sides,  Mary offers to step in as a kind of mediator and it looks for all the world like the matter might be resolved. But events spiral out of control and a bloodbath ensues.  It is a tragedy of unspeakable proportions.

I found ""The Valley of Decision"" to be an absolutely captivating film.  The writing for this movie is superb and the acting first rate all around.  This is a film I would definitely like to see again.  Very highly recommended!",1232582400,4,2624,4.512765957446809
