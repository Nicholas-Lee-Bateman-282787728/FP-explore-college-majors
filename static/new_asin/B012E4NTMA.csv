8726087,4,B012E4NTMA,Very good film--about bigotry on 1930s Georgia!,1444089600,,47,5.857142857142857
8726088,5,B012E4NTMA,"This film is right up there with ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang"" and ""Mississippi Burning"" in that they were quality ""ripped from the headlines"" depictions of actual events.  However, this is more in line with IAAFFACG and less from MB in that this film was made in 1937 when pro-Southern filmmaking and depictions were strongly encouraged due to the significance of the Southern box-office.  MB was essentially preaching to the choir by 1988 and went so far as to fictionalize a tidy solving of the case by the lead FBI characters, while in this film and IAAFFACG, justice is not served at the end, just like the real life incident.  Moreover it came around a time where the public may very well have sympathized with the Southern justice system and the idea of lynching for being justifiably ""tough on crime"" along with various biases very common at the time.

To clear up some supposed criticisms of the film from an earlier review:

The lack of an attempt to identify the true killer of the girl was deliberate because the Leo Frank case is still unsolved, this isn't a whodunnit where the true culprit must be revealed.  It is also preferable that way because whether or not Frank was actually guilty, a lynching was a lynching and the true motive behind it was far removed than simply ""justice"", but with a strong undercurrent of bigotry and hate-mongering  It is a particularly ballsy move at that time because the film bypasses the ""Crime Does Not Pay"" production code edict by making its deliberately murky grimness all the more hard-hitting.  Having a true killer turn up and get his just deserts simply to placate the audience's desire for ""happy endings"" would have softened the blow considerably.

Including the the Leo Frank characters; Jewish element could not be done in 1937.  The mostly Jewish studio moguls at that time were highly sensitive of making anti-Semitism a central issue, fearing unwanted anti-Semetic backlash onto themselves from other parts of the country.  Note the Academy Award winning WB film a year later ""The Life of Emile Zola"" severely undercut the Jewish element of the ""Dreyfus Affair"" in the film and counted on more historically-minded film-goers to connect the dots.  Again, part of a reluctance to prevent stirring of the pot in regards to anti-semetism issues in the USA at a time when Hitler in Europe still swayed millions.

Also Frank representing the influence of the ""carpetbagger"" was a central issue at the time, at least in the South.  Jews and Italians at the time represented Northern corruption to the ""purity"" of the South in those years and Southerners still had an extreme disdain towards carpetbaggers.

What sets this film apart from most others is that it highlights how lynching and hate-mongering was a political tactic in the Deep South used to bolster their political standing withing the community and the state.  Most other films at the time downplayed the political side to these sorts of killings, simply using a single mob ringleader or the KKK as a scapegoat.  Lynching was often equated to supporting ""justice of the people"" and anti-Yankee, racism, religious intolerance got the attention of dyed-in-wool Southerners and intimidated others to leave or follow suit, a tactic that also worked to some degree in certain Northern states too.

One additionally gutsy move at the time was comparing Claude Rains' character to Adolf Hitler at the very end of the film.  It's naturally subliminal to prevent a possible diplomatic incident, but depicting someone with National ambitions whose political fame came from whip up public support through similarly stoking the fears and hatreds of the public and counting on the indifference of others paints a parallel and a warning sign fitting for 1937.",1435708800,9,3772,4.958730158730159
8726089,5,B012E4NTMA,"In response to one of the above reviews, the reason the racial element was subdued or eliminated is that anti-Semitic themes had not yet come into vogue in Hollywood cinema.  That would come some ten years later with ""Crossfire"" and others.

This explains why the presentation focuses on the northern-origin aspect of the accused.  It's still quite powerful, even with this shift in emphasis.

The reason the real killer was not revealed is that the film's point is to expose political and legal corruption.  It was not to create a whodunit, rather a deep study in a gross miscarriage of justice and mob violence.  To have revealed the true killer would have lessened the enactment, lowering its standard to the level of a detective yarn.

As it is, the script is beautifully constructed, the characters finely etched, and the dramatic results truly penetrating.",1344124800,10,862,4.986013986013986
8726090,3,B012E4NTMA,"""They Won't Forget"" is a 1937 black and white film based on the sensational 1913 rape and murder of a 13 year old factory worker in Georgia and the trial of a New York Jewish transplant who was in charge of the factory. The events were chronicled in a 1921 film ""The Gunsalus Mystery"" and a 1935 film ""Murder in Harlem"" (1935). The film is based on the fictionalized 1933 book by Ward Greene called ""Death in the Deep South"". The book's author was a reporter at the 1915 trial.

The film was part of Warner Brothers ""ripped from the headlines"" themed movies. It followed Fritz Lang's successful ""Fury"" (1936) which was also concerned with the lynching of an innocent man in jail.

Claude Rains (1889-1967) plays the DA who hopes that the successful prosecution of a media case will propel him into the Governor's seat. Rains was one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. He appeared in only a few dozen films, but was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (""Notorious"" in 1946, ""Mr. Skeffington"" in 1944, ""Casablanca"" in 1942, and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in 1939) although many people remember him best for ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) or ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938).

Ed Norris (1911-2002) plays a Yankee school teacher suspected of being the killer. Norris made more than 50 films between 1933 and 1955, mostly as a supporting actor in A films (""Boys Town"", ""Queen Christina"") and a lead in B films (""The Escape"", ""Frontier Marshall"").

Gloria Dickson (1917-45) plays Norris' wife in her film debut. Dickson was a popular actress in the 30s and early 40s, with no remarkable achievements to her credit.

Sultry Lana Turner (1921-95) plays the young murdered girl. Turner is best remembered for her roles in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946), ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952), and ""Imitation of Life"" (1959), although it's her performance in ""Peyton Place"" (1957) for which she received her only Oscar nomination

Elisha Cook Jr. (1903-1995) plays Turner's boyfriend. Cook is best known as the ""gunsel"" from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941). He made nearly 200 films from 1930 to 1987.

Harry Davenport (1866-1949) has a small part as a Confederate veteran. He gave us great performances as Dr. Meade in ""GWTW"" (1939), King Louis XI in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), Col. Skeffington in ""Kings Row"" (1942), and Grandpa in ""Meet Me in St Louis"" (1944). FWIW - Davenport was also in ""The Ox Bow Incident"" which is another story about a lynch mob.

Mervyn LeRoy (1900-87) directs. He started out directing with ""Little Caesar"" (1931) and went on to achieve an Oscar nomination for ""Random Harvest"" (1942) and DGA nominations for ""Quo Vadis"" (1951), ""Mister Roberts"" (1955) and ""A Majority of One"" (1961) and a Golden Globe nomination for ""Gypsy"" (1962). Among the nearly 80 films he directed were ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932), ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" (1944).

1937 was a pretty meager year in films. The top grossing films were ""Snow White"", ""Saratoga"", ""One Hundred Men and a Girl"", ""Topper"", and ""Wee Willie Winkie"". The Oscars went to ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (Picture), ""The Awful Truth"" (Director), ""The Good Earth"" (Actress) and ""Captains Courageous"" (Actor). Other notable releases that year were ""Dead End"", ""The Prince and the Pauper"",  the Marx Brothers ""A Day at the Races"", and ""A Star is Born"". Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland made their first film together (""Thoroughbreds Don't Cry"") and Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were voted the King and Queen of Hollywood.

The New York Times said ""with courage, objectivity, and simple eloquence, [the film] creates a brilliant sociological drama and a trenchant film editorial against intolerance and hatred."" They praised the actors - ""you will not find one whose performance does not deserve commendation"" - and the director - ""remarkably skillful direction--there are a few touches as fine as anything the screen has done.""

Despite all the good things that can be said for the movie, there are several problems. Most of the characters are one dimensional and there is no attempt to identify the true killer of the girl. Moreover, in the real story it was the suspect's Jewishness that was the central issue, not his Northern origins.

If you're interested in films about the failures of justice system, better films are Fritz Lang's ""Fury"" (1936), Mervyn LeRoy's ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", and William Wellman's ""Ox Bow Incident"" (1943).

Bottom line - a fictionalized account of the lynching of Leo Frank.",1333670400,6,4542,4.897135416666667
8726091,5,B012E4NTMA,"They Won't Forget is easily one of the best dramas of the 1930s, a decade which also brought us I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, Of Human Bondage, and All Quiet On the Western Front. The film was based on a book, Death in the Deep South, which was a fictionalized account of the true story of the murder of Mary Phagan and the sensationalized trial of her accused murderer, Leo Frank. Beautiful teenager, Mary Clay, is murdered on Confederate Memorial Day. Ambitious lawyer/D.A. Andrew Griffin sees the incident as his path to a Senate seat if he can get a conviction. To accomplish that, he needs the perfect scapegoat (truth be damned!) and he finds him in Robert Hale, a Jewish Yankee from New York City who was a teacher at the school where Mary was murdered. As the evidence is entirely superficial, Griffin uses intimidation, fear, and prejudice to get the results he desires, using a reporter, Bill Brock, to help create a media firestorm against Hale. One of the many elements that makes this film work so well is the explosive and brave screenplay by Robert Rossen and Aben Kandel, written a mere quarter-of-a-century after the horrific incident that inspired the book, the murder of Mary Phagan. Many of those involved were still alive in 1937, and certainly the bigotry and anger that led to such tragic results were still strongly felt. (I do not intend to be oblique, but unfortunately, I cannot go into much detail about the real story without creating spoilers for the film, which I am wary to do. I would hate for the dramatic impact of the film to suffer. Suffice to say, once you see the film, you will be compelled to investigate the truth of this nasty murder and its brutal consequences. For me, I can`t help but ponder some parallels between the actual murder and its repercussions and events in Nazis Germany; I wonder if they were intentional . . . ) Claude Raines is given a rare opportunity to play the lead role in a movie, and he delivers a chilling, tour-de-force, and frighteningly real performance as Andrew Griffin. The final scene between the DA, the reporter, and the wife of the accused, is one of the most dramatic and tragic scenes ever filmed, and the closing lines, uttered by Raines, will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. It is exceptionally fast paced, almost lightning fast, so quick that you barely have time to catch your breath between shocks. As fabulous as Rains is, however, the entire cast is superb, especially Gloria Dickson as Sybil Hale, Edward Norris as the accused murderer, and Allyn Joslyn as the unscrupulous reporter. This is one of my all time favorite films and I can not recommend it highly enough.",1329177600,15,2671,4.649048625792812
