914062,4,6304675151,"If you loved Disney's ""The Absent Minded Professor,"" than you will love ""Son Of Flubber."" While this sequel isn't better than the first, it is a good companion to it. I have found the kids under age 9 get bored with this movie, probably because it is in black and white. This film follows the same safe formula used in the first film, but there is something fresh and new about it that sets it apart from it's predecessor. The storyline is that Professor Branard's invention of Flubber has been confiscated by the government, leaving him and his wife pennyless. By using Flubber gas, he is able to make a gun that can control the weather, however it dosen't work according to plan. After a fight, his wife leaves him. Without funding, Medfield College will have to shut down. So when his invention gets him into trounle with the law, he tries to save the college and his marriage by helping the football team win their last game.
This DVD release is very disapointing. Disney has restored the picture so that it looks almost as good as it did when the film came out, but they released it in fullscreen. This is the kind of film that needs to be viewed in it's original widescreen aspect ratio, because there are a lot of newspaper articles and you miss somw of the headlines. It is real frustrating trying to figure out what it says. The special feature is a photo gallery which includes original promotional material, behind the scenes photos, and advertisements for toys.
""Son of Flubber"" is sutible for the whole family, but it dosen't have enough to keep the little ones interested.",1081814400,43,1586,4.607773851590106

914212,3,6304675151,"With a byproduct of flying-rubber (Flubber), Fred MacMurray (as Professor Brainard) again tries to get rich quick.  He needs money because the dope declared income they didn't get and don't have on their income tax form.  The IRS doesn't care; they want ""their"" money now-now-now!  (They belabor this issue for a goodly amount of time then drop it, never to mention it again.)  Flubber was not the money maker they had hoped it would be when they turned it over to The Pentagon (where it was immediately declared top secret).  They can't sell it or use it in any other applications, meaning they counted their chickens before they hatched.  So the Professor comes up with Flubbergas.  A byproduct of Flubber, it creates weather indoors (which works as a joke but as far as being practical.......).

A lot of story ideas are recycled from the first movie.  They also re-purpose actors from the first movie in different roles, making it confusing.  The plot required a conflict in the newlyweds' marriage.  So Betsy's (Nancy Olson) slimy ex-boyfriend reappears anxious to cause a split so he can get her back.  To that end, he shows up for dinner with an old girlfriend of the Professor's.  Instant ruination/jealousy/split, meaning the Professor has to win his wife back by using his Flubbergas on a member of the Medfield College's football team, allowing them to cheat to victory......again.  This is especially galling as the Professor's ethics are conditional.  He won't throw in with Alonzo P. Hawk's scheme to get rich quick but he will cheat to win a game and get his wife back.  A court trial as a joke is thrown in for good measure, plus the old gag of crashing cars with the police.

This sequel suffers from familiarity and too many recycled gags.  Not as good as the original but still entertaining.",1422489600,,1810,4.802588996763754
914213,4,6304675151,"My husband and I enjoyed ""Son of Flubber"" far more than we expected to.  We'd enjoyed ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" so much that we bought this for a few dollars, just to experience more flubber hijinks.  Apart from a rather tired bit of marital spatting, the movie is delightful, with flubber gas causing rain to come down inside people's cars and crooks trying to get their paws on the precious invention.  Watch Fred MacMurray's ""Absent-Minded Professor"" first, and if you like that, you'll probably like ""Son of Flubber"" too!",1421798400,,529,4.988636363636363

914459,5,6304675151,"It's my opinion that Son of Flubber is as excellent as The Absent-Minded Professor.  You can't expect a sequel to be completely different from the original, since the winning character and plot components have to be there in order for it to succeed like the original.  But there's plenty of room for originality, even so.  I really love the ways the zany Absent-Minded Professor story is made even MORE outlandish in Son of Flubber!  The casting is super, too, and the professor character, Ned Brainard, is my favorite role Fred MacMurray played.

They're not as kid-centric (or sappy) as some of the newer movies out there (like Dora the Explorer movies or some of the Disney animated things).  Plus, there's enough slapstick in them to keep the kids amused.  ""Son of Flubber"" is just as good as ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" and they're both full of fun.",1204329600,2,379,4.8

914466,5,6304675151,"Fred MacMurray portrays the role of Professor Ned Brainerd, the Absent Minded Professor, again.

Brainerd refines his flubber into flubber gas. As in the Absent Minded Professor which had a flubbered Basketball game, this time there  is a sport game of football.

Alonzo P. Hawk (Keenan Wynn), Disney's greatest live action villian, is back with his snake oil evilness aplome. Tommy Kirk reprised his role as Biff Hawk, the professor's friend and Hawk's son. Nancy Olson also returns as Brainerd's supportive wife Betsy.

 Paul Lynde makes an appearance  as the sportcaster, showcasing an early Uncle Arthur from Bewitched laugh in his scenes. Ed Wynn, Keenan's father, cameos in this film as a state officer

If you are fan of Classic Disney work, this is one of the best Disney comedy. If you are looking for more than its one joke premious than it has, don't  watch this. I like this simple comedy, so it is worth my time-I hope it will be yours too

7876072,4,6304675151,"Disney is finally releasing some of their second tier comedies on Blu Ray and Son of Flubber is certainly among the best of them. The original DVD release was appalling filled with excessive grain and the incorrect aspect ratio of full screen. To top it off, there were no extras on that release.

This new Blu Ray is a major upgrade in quality and it is in the correct aspect ratio widescreen 1:66 and retains it's original Black & White presentation. . Please be aware that if you're expecting demo quality you will be disappointed with this release. The film looks great during normal shots, but this is an effects heavy film and those effects shots along with stock footage are going to make the overall presentation seem inconsistent. There is no way to really make the effects shots look much better than they do, but the film looks very good even during these effects sequences. Unfortunately that is where the good news ends, no extras at all. This is one of Disney's early comedy outings and considered a semi classic. In fact this film has a lot more gags than the original and is actually funnier, I think it's a first rate sequel.

While not the deluxe treatment we hoped for it is a marked improvement over the DVD release for the and many other old Disney films that have gotten little to no respect concerning their releases to home video. As far as the film, Disney used the same formal time and time again, This film and a few others from the early years stand out as far superior to the films that followed using the same basic story and tired gags. The Absent-Minded Professor still holds up at the very least as a pleasant, moderately funny, nostalgic trip back to the early days of Disney family comedies.",1493596800,,1726,4.564516129032258
