7931284,5,B000055WG3,"First and foremost, as a response to a review that labels this DVD as ""sooo pretentious,"" the reviewer should stick with Jerry Bruckenheimer's body of work(?) for down home DVD entertainment. Now, getting on with my review: This DVD is packed with extremely interesting ten minute film shorts. Some of the films here, such as ""House"" are stunning. It doesn't take a sensitivity to ""artsy fartsy"" things to get a feel for the beauty inherit in the ""House"" segment. Imagine a house constructed close to an undeveloped Southern California beach which is photographed over the space of a year (1950) or thereabouts, and you can catch a glimpse of the pristine beauty of the West Coast before all the over-development. You catch a glimpse of paradise! For this reason alone, ""House"" is priceless.
  And for shere fun there is ""Scrub."" This is pure titillation! Lounge/exotica music plays as a very attractive, classic 1950's blonde beauty assembles her cleaning supplies, and then proceeds to clean a house (complete with vintage Scandanavian design furniture.) The ""Scrub"" piece seems silly, fun, and erotique, but I had to reflect a while after viewing this one, as I thought, ""So a woman performs demeaning housework and this is a turn-on?"" I can't help but feel that the producers of this film had this in mind as they satirized SUV driven dumb male fantasies! Keep this in mind as you view it.
  The DVD also has one of the best menu layouts I've seen to date. As one review suggests, it really does feel like a magazine; you kind of leaf through film pages, while cool laid back techno house music plays. For the price of a CD by the likes of Linkin Park! you can own a DVD packed with stimulating, humorous, and beautiful images. Well worth the price!",1064966400,14,1753,4.756578947368421
