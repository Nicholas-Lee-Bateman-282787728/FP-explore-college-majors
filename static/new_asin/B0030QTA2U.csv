8385988,5,B0030QTA2U,"This is a fantastic movie, with all actors doing a great job. I forgot they were even acting, which is a good sign they're doing a great job! I liked it more than alot of cliched sports movies where there's an underdog team. This doesn't just have to do with the making of an Indian hockey team, but the empowerment of women and focusing more on women in sports. It is a really feel-great movie, and of course, it's an added bonus that Shah Rukh Khan stars in it!

Just on a side note: I received my blu ray of this movie in excellent condition, all region, with English subtitles and at a great price through one of the vendors here, Dancing Dolphin LLC, in case anyone wants to make sure they get a good version.",1329264000,,714,4.25
8385989,5,B0030QTA2U,"This is a Bollywood film with no dance scenes, barely any romance, a rather limited color palette (by Bollywood's standards), and rather normal-looking girls.  Discouraged?  Don't be!  What is left is a movie with an intense focus on the characters and the condition of Indian women's sports and relationships between the various cultures in India.  The story doesn't stray far from the standard sports movie formula, but it still delivers an engaging and memorable experience with top-notch performances from the athletes.  For the Bollywood fan, I strongly recommend this movie as a refreshing change from the typical Bollywood film.",1320105600,,635,5.373737373737374
