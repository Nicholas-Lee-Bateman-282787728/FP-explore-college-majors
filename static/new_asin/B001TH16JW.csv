8341220,3,B001TH16JW,These are very early TV shows and they are not of the same quality as later TV shows.,1454976000,,85,3.7777777777777777

8341224,4,B001TH16JW,Love the old Roy Rogers TV series.  Picture quality of these DVD's could be better because the same episodes that are shown on TV now are much better.  But still very watchable.,1388448000,3,177,4.5
8341225,4,B001TH16JW,"Roy and Dale were among the great cowboy stars of the forties and fifties. These shows were well produced, however the quality of the discs leaves something to be desired. They are not as good as Gene Autry and Hopalong Cassidy.",1373846400,6,228,4.585365853658536
8341226,5,B001TH16JW,I got this to go with the rest of my Roy & Dale collection. The black & white picture was great for such and old tv show. A must for collectors to get the whole set.,1362441600,5,165,3.611111111111111
8341227,1,B001TH16JW,Poor quality.  No logical sequence.  Same closing credits used on many shows rather than true ending credits.  Waste of money.,1356739200,2,126,5.2
8341228,5,B001TH16JW,Even as a child I loved the Roy Rogers Show. It seem like some of todays Heros could take a lesson from these as to how to be role model. This set of TV shows all have moral and most even state the moral of the show at the end. Good clean Cowboy with the white hat wins TV.,1317168000,4,273,3.6440677966101696
