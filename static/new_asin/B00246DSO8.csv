3845233,4,B00246DSO8,"THE NEW DETECTIVES, as seen on The Discovery Channel, takes you into the real world of high-tech detection and crime solution, following the trail of clues along with renowned forensic experts and criminal investigators. These modern Sherlocks employ a variety of extraordinary techniques, using anthropology, physiology, chemistry, entomology, psychology and computer technology, to solve today's crimes.

This show is really great. If, like me, you enjoy watching shows like ""Forensic Files"", ""48 Hours Mysteries"", or ""Dateline NBC"", then you'll have a great time watching THE NEW DETECTIVES. The way each cases are presented, the narration, the acting, the people interviewed, everything is great about this show. I recommend this show to anybody having an interest from Criminology and Real life mysteries. :)

So this 4-disc set contains Season 4 ( 15 episodes ). Each episode is 50 minutes long.

Disc 1
- Lethal Obsession: Blind ambition, rage, and desire can lead to murder. Forensic psychologists study the workings of the criminal mind.
- Traces of Guilt: Sometimes the scales of justice are balanced by just a few milligrams of evidence - a couple of fibers, a tooth filling, or a smudge on a piece of tape.
- Electronic Witness: Technology becomes a part of our lives, making it almost impossible to move without leaving an electronic trace. When it comes to solving murders, this isn't such a bad thing.

Disc 2
- Dead Wrong: Hiding a body can be difficult; it's sometimes easier to obscure or disguise the circumstances of the death, turning murder into suicide, or pinning the blame on someone else. Forensics can detect these red herrings, and corner the real culprit.
- Lasting Impressions: No matter how careful the criminal, they are bound to leave some trace behind; a fingerprint, a shoe tread. Sometimes, that is all the investigators need.
- Women Who Kill: Women killers are rare. And although they are less violent than men, they they can be more cunning and calculating. Thanks to forensic science, they are also just as likely to ge caught.
- Deadly Dealings: Why do some killers hire others to kill for them? TO create the perfect alibi, out of cowardice or just to get the job done right? No matter, forensics can lead investigators from the killers to those who hired them.

Disc 3
- Body Count: Some serial killers do get away with murder, for a while. But each time they kill, they become more careless, leaving small clues which ultimately lead to their arrest.
- A Taste Of Poison: Deviously putting their victims at ease, those who poison are the most dangerous killers, often the most difficult to detect. And sometimes, they don't stop with one murder.
- Grave Discoveries: Forensic science is constantly improving; new techniques and re-evaluation of evidence in older cases sometimes leads to new discoveries and solutions to previously baffling cases.
- Texas Rangers: Formed in the 1830s to protect settlers against Indian attacks, the role of the Texas Rangers has evolved to keep up with the changing times, and a modern forensics lab is part of their arsenal against crime.

Disc 4
- Bad Medicine: Drug trafficking has spawned a violent and deadly criminal underground, proving a great challenge to forensic investigators devoted to cracking the drug cartels.
- Unlikely Sources: Some of the best clues come from the least likely places. Baffling crimes have been solved and criminals apprehended through evidence provided by insects, beer bottles, and other seemingly meaningless objects.
- True Crime: Crime writers combine the perspectives of law enforcement agents, perpetrators, and journalism. Through their expertise, we get a unique, personal look into the minds of the killers as well as the lawmen and women who toil to bring them to justice.
- Coroner's Casebook: A good coroner provides what's necessary to solve a crime, while a bad one can spoil an otherwise rock-solid case. Two of the country's most respected coroners, Cyril Wecht and Henry Lee, share insights into crime solution on some of their toughest cases.",1352246400,3,4074,5.073134328358209

3845235,5,B00246DSO8,I HAVE ALL FOUR (4) SEASONS OF NEW DETECTIVES AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REST....SHOW IS SIMILAR TO FORENSIC FILES BUT FOR ME ITS BETTER.....FIRST TWO (2) SEASONS SMALL NUMBER OF SHOWS ATTACHED TO EACH SEASON BUT SO FAR SEASONS THREE (3) AND FOUR (4) ARE FULL AND EQUAL TO THE COST PER SEASON. I WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR MAKING THEM AVAILABLE.STEF,1256342400,3,343,4.375
8350328,4,B00246DSO8,"So far as the content is concerned it's great -  5 stars.  As another reviewer mentioned, it's a little dated in comparison to the forensic techniques used today.  However, you get a good picture of how the latest techniques came to be.  Also the actual cases are very interesting. Sad though too. If you are new to this genre these are real cases.  Not made for TV crime like CSI, etc.
I'm giving 4 stars for one reason only...I want to be able to see the entire DVD at once without having it broken down into 'chapters'.  When each chapter of 3 episodes is done you are brought back to the main menu where you must opt to play the next chapter.  That seems a little clunky to me.",1470355200,,681,4.232558139534884
