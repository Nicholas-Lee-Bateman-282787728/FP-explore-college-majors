8719487,4,B00Z344A4U,"""The New Girlfriend"" (2014 release from France; original title ""Une nouvelle amie""; 107 min.) brings the story of David and close friends. As the movie opens, we see make up being applied to a woman's face, perhaps for a wedding? No! We are fooled as it turns out to be the woman's funeral. In a flashback we get to know that woman, Laura, and her BFF Claire. Laura ends up marrying David and Claire marries Gilles. Then, tragically, shortly after giving birth to a baby girl, Laura passes away. Claire promises at the funeral to help David and the baby. Shortly thereafter when Claire stops by David's house unexpectedly, she finds him in Laura's clothes, much to her shock. At this point we're at most 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from French director Francois Ozon, who previously has brought us such excellent movies as ""In the House"", ""Potiche"" and ""Swimming Pooll"". Here, he takes a short story (originally written by Ruth Rendall) and turns it into a feature length about the issue of crossdressing. As David explores his feminine side, Claire must decide whether to support him, and if so, to what extend could this throw a wrinkle into her own marriage to Gilles? At times the film succeeds, at times the film misses. The overall plot does seem a little light for a movie that goes for nearly 1 hr. 50 min. There are several notable performances, none more than of course Romain Duris as David (he was nominated for the French equivalent of the Oscar for Best Actor). Anas Demoustier as Claire is quite the revelation too (for me anyway). Also notable is the excellent orchestral score, courtesy of French composer Philippe Rombi. There are also a number of song placements in the movie, including Katy Perry's Hot + Cold, and, even more appropriate, Amanda Lear (with ""Follow Me"", playing in a nightclub scene),

""Une nouvelle amie"" was released over a year ago, and this weekend it showed up at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati without any hype or advertising. Why now, I have no idea, but better late than never, I suppose. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. As to the movie itself, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed, as I feel it doesn't measure up to the other movies I've seen from Francois Ozon. If you get a chance to check out ""The New Girlfriend"", be it in the theater, on VOD or on DVD/Blu-ray, I suggest you do and then draw your own conclusion.",1444435200,,2596,4.629067245119306
8719488,5,B00Z344A4U,"Each of the Francois Ozon films that I have seen (UNDER THE SAND, SWIMMING POOL. IN THE HOUSE, YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL) deal with the fine line between fantasy and reality and this one is no exception. But this is the first Ozon film (of the ones I've seen) that is also extremely funny even as it examines that fine line.  In fact this film really plays almost more like a Pedro Almodovar film than it does like a Francois Ozon film (albeit an Almodovar without some of the visual and emotive excesses the Spanish director is known for).  You might say this is like an Almodovar film but one moderated with just the right amount of French classicism.

The story begins by briefly tracing the friendship of two young girls from childhood up until the time they each meet their future husbands and marry.  At first it seems like this is going to be the story of two girlfriends but then one of the girlfriends dies very shortly after she is married and so the film becomes a story of the surviving girlfriend and her budding friendship with her dead girlfriend's husband who becomes ""the new girlfriend."" I don't want to give away any details but suffice it to say that the new girlfriend has a liberating effect on her as the relationship requires her to examine an unconventional identty/sexuality that has always been lurking just beneath the surface of her more traditional identity/sexuality.  The real charm of the film is how well the characters each play their parts....both the ones they think they are supposed to play and the ones they find themselves wanting to play. The acting is universally superb.

I saw this film at the New Orleans French Film Festival and the entire audience gave this one a resounding ovation of approval.",1437177600,,1737,4.678688524590164
8719489,5,B00Z344A4U,"The 2015 Seattle International Film Festival welcomed this award-winning (Cesar Awards, 2015 for Actor, and Costume Design; San Sebastian Award, San Sebastian Film Festival) entry from France (English captions). Many of our members are familiar with writer/director Franois Ozon's work (""8 Women"" and ""Swimming Pool"").

The film begins with a brief, wonderfully cast montage which provides the back story about a pair of inseparable friends who grew up together and were in each others lives up to and including marriage, childbirth and one's  unexpected death. The other, a grief-stricken young woman, learns something unexpected about her best friend's widower. ""Une nouvelle amie"" (English captions) takes us into a gender-blending drama which combines sexual tension with the devastating effects of losing a long-time friend.

The cast:
  * Romain Duris (""Mood Indigo"") is David, a grieving young father. He has a secret (he says he was born in a cauliflower) and Claire can help him with it.
  * Anas Demoustier (""Caprice"") is Claire. She can't help but intrude into his life because she had promised her dying friend she would be there for him and his baby girl.
  * Raphal Personnaz (""Anna Karenina"") Gilles has his own agenda: he wants a promotion at work and is ready to be a father at home.

I've liked Romain Duris ever since ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped,"" so it's no surprise that he pulls off this challenging role with such aplomb. Although some of the screening audience had a problem with the French approach to on-screen sex, I liked this one very much and have already ordered my DVD from Amazon.",1436400000,,1617,5.022471910112359
