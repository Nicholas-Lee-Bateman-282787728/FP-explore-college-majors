6567331,5,B00MB0EDLY,"This film was originally shown in VistaVision wide. and the photography was excellent. It was a great aviation film. So, why did you reproduce it in small screen? It loses a lot of the majesty of the B-36 and B-47 bombers. The story is still good but I am very disappointed with the small screen.",1411430400,,296,4.4

6567333,1,B00MB0EDLY,arrived in good time. quality was great. I am really surprised that this movie has not been available before now. as many james stewart movies that are out on dvd this classic should have been a long time ago. I wish that the story of dr. wassell with gary cooper was available on dvd also. all I can find it on is vhs. would recommend you all to everyone.,1411084800,,356,4.173913043478261
6567334,3,B00MB0EDLY,"While I've always loved this movie, I was disappointed in the video quality of this offering.  The moving visuals of the huge B36 flying at altitude weren't well served by the poor copy.  Also the sound was distorted.  I will find a good copy someday.  If the quality was better I would have given it 4 stars.  The movie itself is replete with  the kind of corny, nostalgic, 50s patriotism so many of us ""old guys"" love.  The best part of watching this for me is knowing Jimmy Stewart was rated to fly these behemoths, as he was a brigadier general in the Air Force reserves.  He even flew a B52 mission over Viet Nam, I believe.  A great actor and a great American.  Not like the wussies we have now pretending to be heroic on the screen.  Jimmy Stewart was a REAL American hero.",1410912000,4,780,4.310344827586207

After waiting for almost 20 years to get this ""6 pushing, 4 sucking"" B-36 centric movie in DVD format am disappointed with the quality of the analog to digital transfer and washed out colors.

This DVD production and embedded with a ridiculous amount of digital noise, irrespective of the actual hardware/software set used, looking like it was produced from a low quality, worn out VHS tape, matched to the absolute cheapest, off the shelf software and lowest quality analog to digital video processor, rather than being generated from the original film or even a marginally used, U-Matic format tape paired to first rate equipment.

In addition, the aspect ratio of the reproduction is incorrect, the individuals in this DVD film being slightly too tall.

On the whole, this slacker level DVD product along with very austere packaging, qualifying as a disgrace to the original movie and to the individuals such as my father that served with great pride and honor in the United States Air Force as the Flight Engineer on B-29's and B-47's, along with having flown aboard the B-36 while serving the Strategic Air Command (SAC).

Minus 1.0 for the low quality transfer and color saturation
Minus 1.0 for incorrect aspect ratio
Minus 0.5 for disgracing the United States Air Force, Strategic Air Command

6567337,5,B00MB0EDLY,Beautifully done.  Airplane scenes were fantastic.  Jimmy Stewart and Frank Lovejoy were exceptionally effective in their roles as were the rest of the cast.,1410134400,,157,5.5
6567338,2,B00MB0EDLY,"The 2 stars aren't for the movie, its content, the script, the stars.  No, its for the fact that that it's not even the quality of a DVD.  Burned as required per order and with a pretty low screen resolution, it is incapable of reproducing the grand cinematography which was set up to capture actual air-to-air scenarios.  I liked June Allyson and Jimmy Stewart in the Glenn Miller Story and have a decent DVD of it.  Why can't the studio(s) release this film for DVD?  When I see this sitting in on the shelf, I will many times think of watching it until I remember the crummy resolution.  I wouldn't buy this again.",1409702400,3,617,4.415929203539823

8671256,3,B00MB0EDLY,"Strategic Air Command, 1955 film

It begins at a baseball field, there is an inter-squad game. A big four-engine bomber flies overhead. A general arrives, he explains his mission. They need mature experienced leaders. Dutch is told why they want him and others for 21 months of active duty. This affects his baseball career. His wife supports his choice. Dutch reports to Carswell Air Force base. Holland doesnt look like hi picture; his old uniform was the wrong color. SAC bases are restricted. A DC-3 lands, men pur out of the plane. This is a test by General Hawks. Lt. Col. Holland will learn to fly a B-36. Sally his wife telephones. Dutch and others are given physical tests. Dutch pilots a B-36, which has six propeller engines and four jet engines for extra power for take-off.

It was replaced by the B-47 and the B-52, powered by jet engines. It flies at 40,000 feet. One airman will retire, he misses his family. They show the insides of this huge airplane. They must be ready 24 hours a day seven days a week. [How long does it take to arm this bomber?] The B-36 lands at dusk after a round trip to Alaska. Dutch flies a B-36 to Thule, Greenland, for cold weather tests. There is a fuel leak that threatens the plane! Its 42 degrees below zero. There is a fire in the port engine, it spreads to the wing. The crew bails out, Dutch will try a crash landing on the icy lands. Dutch sees the new B-47 jet bomber. The B-47 has only a three-man crew. It takes off into the wild blue yonder and flies at 43,000 feet (eight miles high). Thee is a test mission for many B-47 bombers.

Dutch will stay in the Air Force permanently. Sally objects to his sole decision. [His sore arm could put an end to his baseball career.] A fuel tanker will refill their fuel tanks in the air. Other airmen will stay in the Air Force. They run into a jet stream and must fly lower. There is a problem with the weather, a low ceiling that can handicap a landing. Pilot Dutch has a problem with his right arm! Fuel is running low too! Radar will guide the bomber to a landing in Okinawa, he is given directions for landing. Dutchs chronic condition will send him to Omaha. He should have reported to medical about his condition. Dutchs career is over, he will return to civilian life. Sally greets him. General Hawks says Dutch should make a good baseball manager.

James Stewart served in the Army Air Force during WW II as a bomber pilot. After the war he returned to his career as a Hollywood movie actor. Did he sort of play the same character in many of his movies? But this is what made him popular and famous. The Strategic Air Command was designed to respond in case of an attack on the USA. In time they would be replaced by Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, an example of a machine replacing men (who might balk at unleashing a nuclear war, or be vulnerable to enemy defense actions). But once launched they could not be recalled like human pilots. [Why couldn't this be included into the design?]",1477440000,,2997,4.443636363636363

This DVD offering is not worth your time to watch.
The video and audio quality indicate both from the video noise in the form of poor detail and audio ""Pumping"" that the source material for this disk was a second or third generation copy of a low quality VHS tape.
If I had known this was going to be such poor quality, I never would have purchased it since I already had made myself a Hi-Def BluRay copy from a remastered print that was aired on TCM a few years ago. That version was a restored first generation print from the original film stock in the correct aspect ratio.
I have heard that the reason all original licensed versions have been allowed to go out of print is the studios have been unable to get the rights to make a newer version for distribution. This means the only source for this film is unlicensed bootleg copies like this one that pay no royalties to the legitimate owners of the films copyright.
If TCM was to ever broadcast this film again I would recommend recording it with a high quality DVR like I used and burning your own copy.
I used the HiDef version of Eye-TV for the Macintosh to record a digital HD version to my hard drive and used ""Toast"" software to burn it to both Blu Ray and at slightly reduced resolution to DVD.
Since TCM went to the expense of restoring the original prints several years ago they are hopefully close to getting the rights to distribute this film properly in the future. Until then, it seems to show up in their rotation every other year and is currently over due since the last time it aired.
I do own an original Paramount VHS tape of this film and even the tape I have which was a worn previously rental sourced and bargain priced used tape has much higher quality video than this bootleg copy. The only downside of the original VHS versions is that they are 4:3 pan and scan versions and the film was shot and intended to be shown in wide screen Panavision.",1419292800,4,1942,4.349862258953168
8671259,5,B00MB0EDLY,"The VHS tape is better.
Why isn't this show released; as a very good copy?

8671261,4,B00MB0EDLY,"Ordinarily, this would get a 5 star rating from me, as I love the film. Also, my late father was one of the two men who loaded the RATO bottles in the B47 for the rocket assisted takeoff, he and my mother were at McDill Air Force Base when they filmed this. The story focuses on exactly the kind of things my family went thru with a father in SAC, long and sudden deployments, etc. And it focuses also on my favorite airplane of the era, the B47.

Unfortunately the quality of the video transfer is not great, almost like it was a cleaned up VCR tape, but as it's all that's available I went for it, I was forewarned by other reviewers but had to have a copy. A classic piece of film that shows what the Cold War was like for the men and women who served at the time. This film really deserves a good BluRay.",1413936000,3,808,4.081761006289308
8671262,3,B00MB0EDLY,"I love this film starring a couple of people that I ""grew up with.""  I was quite disappointed in the less than good quality of the disk I received.  It looked like it was copied from an old VHS copy of the movie.  If this film were available from anyone else in a better quality copy, I would get another one.  I like it enough to hang onto it but I am not totally pleased.  Also, the ""green"" packaging is really cheap and if I had left it in that package, it would have disappeared in between the rest of my movies.  You may have saved a spotted owl but you lost a customer.",1413072000,,575,4.0
8671263,2,B00MB0EDLY,It is a great movie but the color in a lot of the scenes was a little washed out and at 3 spots on the DVD it shot back to a previous spot in the movie and I had to fast-forward it back to the spot that I was watching,1412640000,,217,3.36
8671264,1,B00MB0EDLY,"This DVD is the worst DVD I have ever bought. The quality is terrible. It's a movie I have been looking forward to, but now I'm never going to see it, It's very, very bad. It looks like it has been copied from a very bad tape. Quality control ????? It was cheap, but not cheap enough. I should demanded for a refund.
