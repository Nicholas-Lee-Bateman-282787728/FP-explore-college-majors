2454122,4,B000C8STLM,"A fascinating and often disturbing vision of what the children of North Korea's elite will subject themselves to in order to please their ""father"", Kim Jong-Il.  While I applaud the film-makers for their excellent work, I had to take exception with two points.  First, they seem to accept without reservation the idea that the US would seriously consider invading North Korea.  Second, their translation tones down the language that is used by their subjects to refer to Americans throughout the film.  ""Migungnom"" is literally ""American bastard"".",1183593600,6,547,5.325581395348837

2454126,5,B000C8STLM,"More than just a great film about the aspirations and success of two young athletes, ""A State of Mind"" is an amazing document of a country most of us know so little about.  For the first time anywhere we get a peek inside a school, a train ride to Mt Paektu, a visit to a rural festival, and a glimpse inside the lives of the average North Korean, or at least the average resident of Pyongyang.

This is not the first movie on North Korea for filmmakers Daniel Gordon and Nick Bonner.  Gordon, a former sports producer for Sky Sports and BBC, shot his first feature length project on the North Korean soccer team to the 1966 World Cup in England.  That film, 2002's ""The Game of Their Lives,"" went on to garner great critical acclaim and is one of the few films - if perhaps the only - to be shown near simultaneously in both North and South Korea.

Using the connections they had made in the production of ""The Game of Their Lives,"" as well as the goodwill they had fostered with the North Korean government in making a nonpolitical film, Gordon and Bonner set out shortly thereafter to start work on ""A State of Mind,"" for which they were given unlimited access, a rare privilege in North Korea.

The filmmakers spent the better part of 2003 in North Korea shooting two aspiring prepubescent female gymnasts and their families in Pyongyang.  The camera follows them into their homes, showing us scenes of life that take place everyday all over the world - a mother rousting her child from bed, a grandmother pestering the granddaughter to do her homework, a quiet evening at home with the family around the television, three generations of women preparing meals, children trying to find ways to escape from their chores, a father complaining that he lives in a houseful of women who do nothing but chat, chart, chat.

Equally there are scenes that could not have been filmed anywhere else.  The average citizen-athlete continually reminds us that he or she practices sport for the glory and amusement of the General (Kim Jong Il), who protects and guides the North Koreans through a dangerous and hostile world. Each Pyongyang apartment comes with preinstalled state radio, affixed to the wall, which can be turned down but can never be turned off.  The family television is a gift from the state in thanks for their daughter's participation in the mass games.  The father of one of the girls, a university instructor, reveals that for many years North Koreans couldn't understand the peace sign they saw foreigners making in footage broadcast on state television.  A teacher solemnly instructs her students on the three great aspects for which Kim Jong Il is internationally admired - his ideology, his leadership, and his aura.

The main part of the film has Gordon and Bonner following the two girls as they train in preparation for the annual mass games, a gargantuan show featuring thousands of performers in elaborately choreographed dance.  Like kids everywhere, the two girls featured here would at times rather be out playing with friends than practicing their routines, but for the most part seem happy in their lives and in their chance to perform at the main event.  There's no post-games follow-up, but you know the girls must have disappointed that the General did not attend any of their performances.

Like ""The Game of Their Lives,"" what makes ""A State of Mind"" truly special is that the filmmakers keep their opinions to themselves and let their subjects and the camera do the talking.  The polemicizing has been left to the reviewers and the reporters, a very good example of which is contained in the bonus section of the DVD, a 5-minute feature from CNN in which ""reporter"" Paula Zahn makes it clear to her audience exactly how it is supposed to interpret some of these scenes.

See it for yourself and make your own decisions.",1154822400,7,3850,4.746626686656672
2454127,4,B000C8STLM,"One of two DVDs on North Korea I've seen: ""Seoul Train"" is another DVD I highly recommend (for the darker side of N Korea).  Unlike ""Seoul Train"", ""A State of Mind"" tries to present an objective portrayal of life for two young gymnasts in Pyongyang.  The filmakers don't have to try to highlight the negatives of life in N Korea: they come out naturally.  You get to see the best of North Korea in this video.  You also get a hint of the harsh realities: absurd and unnecessary hardships that North Koreans accept as a normal way of life because their Dear Leader has trained them to.  Also interesting is the specific hatred for the USA cultivated in all North Koreans by their government.  All in all, a worthwhile DVD for someone wanting to know more about life in Pyongyang, the showcase capital of North Korea.",1151539200,6,815,4.5479452054794525
2454128,5,B000C8STLM,"I highly recommend A State of Mind, a newly released documentary on North Korea. Why do I recommend it? It is particularly worth seeing because British filmmaker, Daniel Gordon, was actually given permission to film by North Korea, one of the least known or understood nations in the world. The film dramatically conveys how an authoritarian regime has shaped the minds of its people. North Koreans are totally indoctrinated in believing in their Dear Leader, communism and the idea that their country is the best place in the world. The film provides images of Pyongyang and the way of life of the people who reside there. Interviews reveal that North Koreans are very interested in our war in Iraq and convinced that the United States is an imperialist threat to their way of life and that our economic sanctions are the source of their hardships. American audiences will be surprised to see healthy and cheerful North Koreans and to hear them stoically admit that food and energy shortages are part of city life.

The film focuses on two delightful North Korean schoolgirls  (ages 11 and 14) who are selected to train for the Mass Games and whose lives revolve around a rigorous daily routine to prepare for the Games in hopes that Kim Jong Il (often known as the Dear Leader) will be there to see them perform and know that they are good communists. The shots of the actual Mass Games where 100,000 people participate in an elaborately choreographed exhibition of dazzlingly colorful, perfectly synchronized routines will stay in your mind forever. Needless to say, the Dear Leader never showed up for any of the Games.

Koreans understandably will see this as a sad film and it is. I personally find it tragic, fascinating, thought provoking and invaluable for many reasons. It is my hope that A State of Mind will make Americans more attentive to the existing crisis on the Korean peninsula and the ongoing threat of nuclear war.

2454129,5,B000C8STLM,"I am not normally one for documentaries but so much has been said about the regime in North Korea that this movie was impossible to pass up. One cannot be anything else but sceptical when reading the jacket notes about the access of the documentary crew and the lack of interference by the minders but after watching the movie it is clear why this is the case.

The subject matter is relatively straightforward. North Korea operates under a collectivist regime where individuality is sacrificed to the needs of the state. The documentary examines a public manifestation of that overarching impetus in the Mass Games and counterposes the lives of two individuals aspiring to participate in the presentation before the current leader of the country. As a backdrop to that journey the documentary looks at the ordinary lives that these two people lead in their journey to the event.

What emerges is a picture of a society where the inhabitants see the outside world from a perspective which is radically different from that of secular westerners. The concept which continualy comes to mind is gestalt which means that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. What is fascinating to me is that there is no coming together of either view. The documentary presents a picture which is sumptuous in it's colours and organisational feats but which illustrates to our eyes the paucity of the collectivist ethos and the damage which is done to the individuals in that society. At the same time ina gestalt switch the viewer who holds such views sees the same film as one which illustrates the achievement of something for the common good despite the considerable adversity. Shoertages are endured and people are taught to be self-reliant, a concept so proudly associated with the concepts of Liberalism (in the European rather than the American sense).

One is transfixed as the movie progresses with the determination and resolve the two young girls show in order to achieve, for them, the highest possible accolade in their society.

From a slightly more jaundiced perspective it is not surprising that this film was shot without interference. Both families under the watch of the filmcrew live in Pyon Yang, rightly considered to be the showcase of North Korea's socialist sytem. The only departure from that city is to a collective farm for a brief holiday and although the famine's and food aid are mentioned it is not possible to infer any generalisation about life in the country from that one example which is not filmed in much detail.

All in all this is a film about individual development in a totalitarian state. For those of us who aspire to Liberal ideals it is a testament to how individuals can achieve what they set out to achieve, regardles of the prevailing political sytem. For those of a more communitarian bent, it is a film which brings out the best features of a collective system where the individual subordinates their own needs to those of the society as a whole.

This certainly is a spectacular movie, no getting away from that. It is also the first peek under a very heavy curtain and hopefully will not be the last. As a counterfactual it would be interesting to see a North Korean documentary on a western democracy to try to understand their society a little more.",1139011200,33,3296,4.835106382978723
2454130,5,B000C8STLM,"Obviously the above reviewer hasn't seen the film or he would appreciate how the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the Bush doctrine of ""pre-emptive war"" played right into the hands of North Korea's paranoia and fueled its propaganda machine. This is clear in the classroom scene.

But the most interesting thing is that the film reveals the two North Korean families profiled have carved out a private sphere which shows life to be not all that different from everywhere else. Yes, they are nationalistic to an extreme  but quite polite in expressing criticism of the United States which the older people only know through the Korean War.

Highly recommended for those seeking insight into a place we know little about.",1138233600,3,712,4.916666666666667
2454181,5,B000C8STLM,"Some years ago, at about the time the US military was liberating Iraq, removing weapons of mass destruction and ensuring that human rights were strictly respected there and independent but embedded military correspondents were reporting on sometimes staged 'news events' such as the toppling of Saddam's statue in central Baghdad, an independent BBC crew was allowed inside hard to penetrate North Korea to chronicle a few months in the life of a young Korean girl and her family. Apparently, other than being followed and observed 24x7 by North Korean translators and guides, there was no interference with their reporting and, as far as they could tell, their subjects were allowed to talk freely about their love for the General (North Korea's leader), their hatred of US imperialism and to show their pride for North Korea's great accomplishments.

Jong-il Kim, the girl they followed was one of the tens or hundreds of thousands who were training daily for what North Koreans call the Mass Games: periodic shows of synchronized gymnastics, singing and other patriotic activities. Those games together with the large military and popular parades are/were ways for the North Korea's leadership to show the 'masses' that the people and their leaders were and were going to stay 'as one' forever, keep their own style of socialism going and repel any outside attempts at overthrowing the leadership. The training was tough and intense and it began months in advance of the scheduled Mass Games but the kids shown appeared to be always determined and motivated and, while sometimes complaining of bruises or injuries, never questioning the importance of their work: to make the General happy and proud and prove themselves as great future patriots and communists. Dancing for the General, in General's presence is the greatest honor a young North Korean can possibly dream of.

As the training and rehearsals are followed we get a chance to see brief snapshots of life in North Korea's capital city. There is an apartment were a 'working class' family lives. There is another apartment in which a family of 'intellectuals' lives, not unlike the working class family apartment. Here is a housewife shopping for semi-plucked, skinny chicken - and each citizen is allowed one chicken and 6 eggs every month. There is this incredible Orwellian footage of the speaker (NOT a radio) that apparently MUST exist in every kitchen, piping constant government propaganda, whose volume can be lowered but can NEVER be turned off. Life is tough but people say they trust their leader and say that they are ready to die defending him. Pride they have and there's little else they have but pride seems to keep them going. Without revealing the plot because there is none, once the Mass Games take place - sadly, the General can't attend - and the performances are over the girls go back to intense training for the next Games and so life in North Korea continues.

Strangely, I could not stop watching this movie/documentary once I started. Beyond the staged ten thousand kids performing some elaborate and perfectly synchronized choreography the camera keeps coming back to the girls' families, their picnics, their sad-to-us-looking pilgrimages to revolutionary sacred grounds. It's heart-warming and heart-breaking at the same time, observing the humanity of these overworked, undernourished, starved for real news little people and their quick transformation into fierce, perfectly disciplined fighters or robot-like-perfect flashy athletes and dancers, approvingly applauded by the ruling elite in the stands. These children who will never grow as tall as their chromosomes say they should, likely to begin losing their teeth and their good health at an early age and unlikely to ever travel beyond their country's and sometime their city's boundaries, they aren't that different from our own, pledging their allegiance to the flag each morning, better fed, playing different games, often within earshot of some news broadcast freely repeating what could be the consensus line on current events.

2454182,5,B000C8STLM,"A State of Mind is truly a very rare look at life in North Korea. While we are not shown all aspects of North Korean life--not by a long shot--we do gain great insight into the country's culture as the government wants it to be: the individuality of the person is essentially cast aside for the need and the good of the total society. To see the impact of this philosophy and style of government (which is not exactly a democracy), we see two young girls striving, regardless of any physical pain, to be chosen to participate in the Mass Games, an annual event in North Korea. The Mass Games are stunning to watch as many thousands of gymnasts and others dance, perform, and create pictures to show their dedication to the government and to ""The General,"" North Korea's current leader, Kim Jong Il.

The film progresses very well and I learned a lot about North Korean life even though the focus was on the two young girls preparing and hoping to be chosen to participate in the current year's Mass Games. Kim Song Yun and Pak Hyon Sun practice seemingly endlessly.

To a lesser extent, we also see a few of the hardships people face in North Korea; there are blackouts almost every night even in Pyongyang, the capital of the country, if you are considered privileged so that the government will allocate living quarters for you and your family to live there. There is also a very limited media which consists of one television station that broadcasts five hours a day. In addition, there is footage of young girls (including Kim Song Yun and Pak Hyon Sun) being taught in school how evil America is; and it seems that whenever anything goes wrong (for example, a blackout) the people automatically blame American ""imperialists.""

However, the true focus of the movie is on the games; and I must say they are extravagant, stunning and amazing--to say the least. You're bound to enjoy and even marvel at the footage of past Mass Games; the precision with which everyone performs is striking and superlative.

Overall, I highly recommend this documentary. It shows us a slice of life in a country that is not often understood especially because North Korea's government is rather enigmatic. This is also an excellent film for anyone who enjoys sports and political documentaries.",1285113600,2,2278,4.744949494949495
2454183,4,B000C8STLM,"Is propaganda having more adherents truth, and that having fewer mind-control? Power is self-serving. It only seeks to extend itself, consolidate itself, protect itself. To that end control of the population's world-view is crucial. In some countries it's less sophisticated; in others it's more so. People, however, are quite alike in fundamental ways. It's a shame we don't have more statesman encouraging dialogue and mutual understanding and promoting the COMMON GOOD (which, it seems to me, should be a matter of common sense).

2454184,3,B000C8STLM,"North Korea is difficult to learn about because of its deliberate isolation and intense government control. Obviously the nation stresses subordination of the individual to the community, and this is the theme underlying the two girls followed in their training for the Mass Games of 2003. The big honor for participating is to be seen by The Great Leader - Kim Jong-Il.

The two girls are always very polite - introducing their parents and other relatives, and bowing to their parents upon returning home. They are dedicated and work very hard to perform well, though it is painfully clear that their time would be much better spent on other activities, such as school. Usually there is no electricity in the evening. The one family has a small color TV - given to the daughter for prior Mass Games participation. Some 80,000 gymnasts were used to act out 13 scenes reminiscing on North Korea experiences in the Korean War. (The U.S. is viewed as extremely evil.) About 12,000 other schoolchildren are used to present impressive visual displays of Kim Jong-Il and other scenes.

Rationing is still in effect in North Korea - even in Pyongyang, its showcase capital; six international flights arrive there each week. The city is bright and clean on the main street, rather drab in other locations. Residents there get one chicken and 5 eggs every month, plus an undefined amount of other items. The two families went to a flower show - the two flower types on display were each named after one of the Kims. One of the families was able to take a 30-mile weekend trip to visit one of the father's former army friends - first time in ten years, and it required a permit and two hours of travel each way. The countryside was attractive, though it was obvious that North Korea has few vehicles and only narrow roads, though lots of statutes. Scenes at a construction site showed dirt being moved by hand - without even a wheelbarrow.

Summertime practices ran from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. One group was eventually replaced because their performance was not up to standard - I'm thinking they were the lucky ones. Eventually the Mass Game performances were held, but Kim Jong-Il never showed up. Festivities began with a mass military parade, then a citizen parade, followed by a youth candlelight parade. In total, one million marched in the parades that day. There were then two shows/day for 20 days. Training for the next Mass Games began the next day.

Problems with the film include generally poor quality video, audio that is so low it is very difficult to hear, very, very little translation offered and no subtitles.",1266796800,4,2613,4.774336283185841

Real human beings and it's so nice to see that!  So many documentaries try to skew the facts and showcase people as either angels or demons.  What hold this together is the humanity beneath it all.

2454186,5,B000C8STLM,"North Korea fascinates due to it being the most isolated (by its own choice) and most severely repressive nation on Earth. There are, to my knowledge, three insightful DVDs on the subject: `A State of Mind', `National Geographic - Inside North Korea' and `North Korea: A Day in the Life'. I have purchased all three. An important point to note is that any footage allowed out of North Korea is almost exclusively of the capital, Pyongyang, which is far from being representative of life in the country as a whole. Only a fraction of the population are specially selected to live there; even for these `privilaged' souls life is bleak and dominated by political propaganda.
`A State of Mind' concentrates on the preparations of two young gymnasts for the showpiece Mass Games performance. Of the three, this DVD gives by far the best and deepest insight into the brainwashed mindset of the North Koreans, with its excellent documentary narration and carefully selected material. It is also important to bear in mind however that this film only shows what is approved by the regime - all the despicable aspects of the North Korean experience are not covered. There also has remarkable footage of the Mass Games of course and the grand military parades (both visually stunning) that seem to be the focus of life there.
`National Geographic - Inside North Korea', being told from our outsider's perspective, is the only complete and balanced overview of North Korea here. It puts North Korea on the map with its historical context, draws widely on footage from many sources and - free of regime censorship - shows as best it can the true horror story that the regime tries to hide at all costs. Information presented on health standards, nutrition and the extensive concentration camp system are quite staggering.
`North Korea: A Day in the Life' is what the title says it is; it follows a day in the life of a `typical' (regime selected) family in Pyongyang. This is not narrated and concentrates solely on the daily routine, so really brings across the bleakness of these people's life. Again this officially-approved film only shows what is approved by the regime. The carefully selected images shown (for example the table overloaded with food in a city known to be tightly rationed) and the often unreal scripted dialogue only really serve to show how out-of-touch the regime is which choreographed it. This film does show well the grinding inefficiencies of North Korean life, but all-in-all compares poorly with `A State of Mind'.
For a good understanding of North Korea, I recommend viewing `National Geographic - Inside North Korea' and `A State of Mind', in that order.",1249689600,6,2675,4.933481152993348
2454187,5,B000C8STLM,"Of course, aside from politics, the spectacle that all of these highly talented individuals put on is truly amazing in the Mass Games ... of course, once again, everything isn't what they seem to be. In this case, communism-driven Mass Games.

I guess, in short, everyone (the kids, the adults, the elderly---all) is brainwashed by the government of the ever-ruling communist General. Seriously... controlled food, controlled leisure, controlled household, etc etc etc. How dare they (especially the kids!) hate us and call US evil, call US ""Bloody Americans!"" ... The kids are taught this hatred when young and it continues through the rest of their life! They are CUT-OFF from the outside media! They are informed? HA! Only through the government! And they only share what pleases their communist lives.

Do you feel that the novel might be a bit dated because its ""date"" has passed and so has the Soviet Union, the totalitarian state on which it was partly based? Well, this film ought to freshen things right up for you and your students.  In many ways, the North Korean state is the embodiment of all the techniques of the totalitarian state that are described in the novel: the manipulation of history, the deification of the leader, mass propaganda, media control, the concept of endless war. Believe me, students gape, and for them, the novel comes right off the ""boring assignment"" queue and into history as it is happening in front of their eyes. (It's never hard to find North Korea news in the newspapers, either.)

However, it is also interesting to consider the North Korean instruments of control that Orwell did not anticipate: the beauty of the mass games, the obvious delight of parents in their talented children, the intensity of purpose that comes with idealism, however misdirected. High school students who are reading Orwell are riveted by this film, but you don't have to be in high school to appreciate this nuanced,compelling, and, in places, gorgeous film.",1193702400,4,1206,4.873170731707317

8096426,5,B000C8STLM,"Prior to watching A State of Mind, I had never heard of the Mass Games. They are a sight to behold and this film does an exquisite job of showing the efforts that go into creating them by the North Korean people.

In addition to footage of the Mass Games, this film is packed with a wealth of info about the North Korean culture. Since so little information about the country ever reaches us in the outside world, I was stunned at how much was in this documentary. This movie is just as much about their culture as it is about the Mass Games.

The Mass Games are just a single (although still large) example of how the whole country is pressed to think with a like mind. They all think the same, act the same, feel the same etc. Any questioning of the countries authority is forbidden. Housing for the different social classes is allocated by the state. They all have to listen to the same one radio station and watch a single television channel that airs for 5 hours a day. Perfection is expected by every member of society and their only reward is the possible happiness they may be able to bring to the countries leader, Kim Jong-Il.

This documentary does not try and paint the country in a bad light. The films commentator has a calm mellow voice that simply states the facts and describes the events. This leaves the viewer to come to their own conclusions. The beauty of the Mass Games shown in the documentary is undeniable. It shows just how much effort the people in North Korea put into this event, and while the country may be financially stricken, they have a very powerful state of mind.",1318636800,,1601,4.438775510204081
8096427,5,B000C8STLM,"A State of Mind is an incredible look into some of the more commonly discussed points of North Korean life as lived by a group of privileged North Koreans.  This BBC production follows two young female athletes preparing for the Mass Games, and provides a glimpse into to their training life and their family life.  The Mass Games are highly representative of the communist ideology, and therefore the decision by the DPRK government to allow BBC to follow these young athletes was likely viewed as a means to share this picture of North Korea to the world.  The portrait is one of dedication; of self-sacrifice for the welfare of the group; of athletic health and strength; and finally of beauty produced through the efforts of the collective.

Korean Studies, Eastern Studies, History, and Political Science majors should see this documentary, keeping their propaganda goggles firmly set.  I would recommend this to high school courses in international studies or government, but only once a discussion on propaganda has occurred.",1315094400,2,1032,5.119047619047619

Thank you a whole lot !!",1309651200,,92,3.65
8096429,5,B000C8STLM,"I was astonished after watching this British documentary about North Korea.  Filmmakers used the state event of great proportions that is showcasing young teenagers preparing for the national ""Mass Games"" that celebrates North Korea as a nation and their president as their leader.  Two young female gymanasts, best friends, narrate about their school, teenage life and daily routine of practice for the show that is demanding and both physially and emotionally draining.

If one ever wanted to see methods of indoctrination for the nation, they need to see this film.  There are images everywhere celebrating the achievements of their nation, greatness of their leader and importance of self-reliance.  There are three classes ion North Korea: peasant class, working class and intellectuals, but amazingly enough through this film we see them all think and act in unison.  No matter how many people talk, they seem to have the same message about their perception of the outside world, the west, their political system and the way of life.  Radios placed in government subsidized apartments provide constant stream of information.  Pictures of the Korean president are prominently displayed on the apartment walls that seem not to have any other form of decoration, but those photographs.  Girls' dedication to practice is unrelenting and their belief in the greatness of their country is unwavering as it is of their parents and grandparents.

The isolation of the country (lack of international news, fact that there are only 6 international flights/day that come in and out of their capital, the quickness to blame US for everything - from food to electricity shortage) is astonishing.  I used to believe that only Albania used to be like that, but I guess North Korea has taken a strong detemination to be a bastion of communism worldwide.  Their hatred of the US and other ""western"" powers of imperialism is fascinating.

It is amazing how sensitive nations like these are and it is important to realize how important diplomacy is when handling imporant political negotiations.  There have been generations of brainwashed people over there, who have very little or no tolerance towards outide world.  Their firm belief is self reliance is so strong that any time it turns out not to work they will be quick to balme someone else for it - it not nature and other nation.  Fascinating movie that needs to be watched and discussed.",1306108800,,2433,5.106060606060606
8096430,4,B000C8STLM,"It was a real treat for someone such as myself who loves to learn about life in other countries, the nuances of daily living for people in other parts of the world to watch a film with insight into one of the most isolated and secretive countries in the world. The film is informative, fascinating, and the narrator abstains from passing judgement on the subjects of the film.

I found parts of the film extremely disturbing. The everyday intense hatred of my country was definitely difficult to watch and I found this a distrubing aspect of the film. It made me very sad that the relations between my country and other parts of the world are so strained.

But on another level I found the film heartening in that it confirmed what I have always believed; people are people. No matter where they live. I watch two girls hanging out together, one wishing she had siblings, too instead of being an only child. I watch girls running around after class. I watch a family eating and laughing together. And it's all very human. And I think many people in my country and others need to see that. Need to see eadch other's human nature.

One complaint I have is that we only see Pyongyang which the narrator tells us is the wealthiest part of the country and it's an 'honor to live there.' I understand that a movie about a country has to have a scope but considering the limited amount of material concerning the country, I was disappointed to have such a limited view of the country to one city that is anything but typical.

Still, great film. Loved it!",1294531200,4,1548,4.498220640569395
