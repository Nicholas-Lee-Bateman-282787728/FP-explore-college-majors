5198393,5,B008ZRKIHA,"My thoughts:

 This is Our Time  is a remarkable movie.  As the credits rolled down the screen, I just sat there, quiet and thoughtful.  I remember the conquer the world, I can do anything elation of college graduation.  This story portrayed a gamut of emotions and experiences young adults can face after the final exams are history.  This is Our Time is so relevent, not only to young adults, but to older adults, too.  There are many of us who feel like life has passed us by, or we should be changing the world.  Instead, we're just doing our everyday thing.  God has purpose for us, in us, and through us.  I've reviewed many movies, but this one really stands out.  It's not a feel good movie, it's a deep thought movie.  I think it is well worth your time and attention.

 I watched this with my family.  If you're concerned about the leprosy, it is not shown during the movie.  It is safe to watch with your family.  There is a three minute video at the end that explains the ministry of Embrace a Village in India.  It does show people with leprosy that could be disturbing to young children.

My family's thoughts:
 ""It is a wow faith movie, very spiritually intense.  I really think everyone should watch it.""  ~ Amy, 11 years old

""It was very realistic, more like real life than a movie."" ~ Michael, 13 years old

""Inspiring, I've never cried so much at a movie."" ~ Emily,  15 years old

""It's not our time, it's His.  It's not about what we do, it's about what He's called us to be.""  ~ Lowell, the papa.",1365984000,97,1518,4.340501792114695

This Is Our Time To seize God's calling, 2012
Pure | Flex Entertainment Presents ~

Tomorrow is release day! April 16, 2013

This DVD is about an actual place through Embrace a Village, a ministry to those with leprosy disease and their families in India. Embrace a Village, a Christian non-profit organization based in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, exists to help transform the lives of leprosy victims and their families: Our mission is to bring Jesus Christ's message of hope and healing. To achieve our vision within each leprosy colony, we raise the standard of living for leprosy victims across India and help them to help themselves integrate back into mainstream Indian society through relief projects, education and spiritual ministries. Embrace a Village is a 501(c)(3) organization. Donations are tax deductible. You can learn more at embraceavillage.org. The story is fictional, but with a strong message of courage, love, and compassion. Ethan, Luke, Al, Ryder and Catherine are five friends connected by their strong faith. After graduation, they each set out to make a difference in the world for God. Their ambitions are high, their passions are strong but will they have the courage to fulfill their calling regardless of what comes their way? The sacrifice they are asked to pay may just be too high. Through godly wisdom from an outside source, the group realizes that this is not their time after all, it's all His! Come along with these new graduates as they discover who they are to be, rather than what they are to do. This is God's time as we yield our lives to Him, and allow Him to do through us.

What I liked about this movie is the interaction between the characters facing hard things:
* separation after being together as they each begin their paths after graduation
* standing up for Truth in decision-making values
* the uncertainty of being accepted to grad school
* grieving loss
* being fired from a job to find the ultimate job by giving for the good of others
* being able to reveal and talk about true feelings
* building trust

The movie flows very fluidly without gaps, and is viewable by all ages. Color, 104 minutes.

Pure Flix is a Christian movie studio that produces, distributes, and acquires Christ centered movies for the sole purpose of changing our culture for Christ, one heart at a time. Our mission since day one has remained the same and we continue to strive to make a difference for His name.

""It was sad""... was the consensus ""and happy too"".
If any of you watched October Baby, I would put this in a similar category.
The acting may not be ""win an Oscar"" amazing, but the story IS great,
inspirational, full of teachable moments on the ""will of God"" and
very much worth watching.",1365984000,,326,4.5423728813559325
5198396,5,B008ZRKIHA,"I got this movie from FlyByPromotions to blog about.  My family watched it last night and it was AMAZING!! I so wish that more of the movies coming out in today's world were like this.  Great stories and things that end up teaching you something!!  Would be perfect for a youth group or a family movie night.  Made us cry, laugh and want to know God's purpose for our lives, since even after college all of our purposes might change!!",1365984000,3,434,4.3875
5198397,5,B008ZRKIHA,"This is our Time was such a poignant and gripping movie that I could relate to in so many ways. Often times in my life I've wondered and even questioned God's timing and the answers never seem to come easy.

A group of friends, one a brother and sister pair, graduate from college and enter the real world to fulfill their dreams. While most feel called to a certain purpose, Ethan is left struggling with what his future will bring. The plans for graduate school immediately following college don't come to fruition and he gets stuck in a dead end job working for his dad.

Ethan watches his newlywed sister and her husband travel to India to work for Embrace a Village where they believe they have been called to serve. His two best friends get jobs in the fields of their choosing and he seems to be the only one left behind and stuck in a place he doesn't want to be.

I could relate to Ethan on so many levels. I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up and floundered in college taking years longer than needed simply because I couldn't focus and had no direction. I saw my friends go off and fulfill their dreams while I hadn't even figured out what mine were yet. Like Ethan I often questioned God's timing and even where he was when bad things happened.

When unspeakable tragedy strikes, Ethan is left shell shocked and even more confused about his purpose and why something so awful happened. But as many men before him in the Bible discovered, it is often through the darkest hours that God's purpose is brought to the light. Ethan finds his purpose, hope and a future when his faith is restored.

Sometimes dreams are shattered and sometimes they don't look like what we thought they were supposed to. But God has his hand in all of it and this is a great reminder of that.

This is our Time is an amazing movie that I hope every teenager and college aged person should watch. Even I, at thirty-something, found meaning, hope and inspiration in this movie. What a beautiful message of faith!",1365984000,31,2009,4.430894308943089
5198398,4,B008ZRKIHA,"I have mixed feelings about This is Our Time. It is a wholesome film appropriate for the entire family although probably of most interest to teens through adults. There is no use of drugs, alcohol or smoking. There is no violence, inappropriate language nor mention of sex. It has an important message especially for youth graduating from high school or college. God and faith are mentioned often as it is a Christian film.
  There was something about the quality of the filming that struck me as less than the big screen - there were multiple scene changes that utilized a longer than expected blackout. The actors playing the main characters (who just graduated college) looked too old (although that is commonly done in Hollywood). At times, I found the background music to be distracting under the dialogue; I think its volume needed to be lowered.
  You can view the trailer here but it does contain spoilers. I think the film would provide great topics for discussion for high school youth groups and even young adult groups. Overall I would give the film a B- (which is really 3.5 stars)

5198399,5,B008ZRKIHA,"The DVD This Is Our Time to seize God's calling is very good. The story line is excellent and it kept me interested through every part. The acting was good, but to me it seems like a low budget film. Even so the story really pulled it through and I believe it will be a movie that will last.
  You find everything in this movie from greatest joy, to depths of great sadness. Also you will see favoritism and learn how to deal with loss and to keep going on.
  Even in a world that believes making money is everything you can see that money doesn't cure problems or help you when you're down. Also you find in a world that doesn't follow God that many things are overlooked and put up with.
  Follow these five graduates as they make descions, some are good and some are bad. How they help each other and how they let God lead them.
 A movie to be watched by the whole family and it will be greatly enjoyed. I highly recommend it.

5198400,5,B008ZRKIHA,"A recent resurgence of Christian themed movies have led to some powerful messages for young and old alike, this one an appropriate reminder God has a purpose for each one of us, a timely purpose!

'This Is Our Time'  will remind many of us of those free and easy college years when the whole world was ahead of us, we were going to make our mark and change everything for the better!

As we meet our protagonists, it is evident each of them have a path ahead of them, some of those well defined, and others struggling to find a purpose in life. Ethan just happens to be one whom God chose as the 'glue' to keep the others together when hard times hits the group!

Drawn partially against the 'Embracing a Village' background in India and Leprosy, I felt the movie to give a powerful reminder of God's message: God's timing is His own, His purpose known to Him only.

I also found the excellent cast to portray the passions of the younger and the wisdom of the older generations believable. Actor and speaker Bruce Marchiano as the trusted Professor and Award Nominee Eric Roberts as the father of two of the graduates lend serious talents to this group!
Kudos to producers such as David A.R. White and writer Lisa Arnold for yet another well done story!

Don't miss the special features showcasing Embracing a Village with its warmhearted message:

For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in...

5198401,5,B008ZRKIHA,"My Thoughts:

 This movie was a very touching tribute to those of us that go above and beyond to search out and achieve the call God has placed on our lives. God calls us all to glorify Him and to be on a mission to win souls. But many of us are called to go past that into even broader territory. This film focuses on the lives of five friends all seemingly going into different places in their lives only to be brought back and bound together for a mission that one could not finish.

 The purpose of the calling isn't the calling it is about Him and the character of the individual. Too many times we are afraid to do what He is calling us to do. Maybe afraid that we don't measure up, that we are not equipped for ""the call"". But don't you see that this is something God will place in us all. He equips the called. He wants us to depend on Him to get us through it. He will be there each step of the way to guide you and to help you be the best you can be in Him.

 This movie was a tear jerker for sure. Our family has had a call place on it by the Almighty when my husband was called to be a minister. So we know a little about the trials and tribulations that a call of that magnitude can bring. So many of the issues addressed here really hit home for us. We really enjoyed it.

5198402,5,B008ZRKIHA,"Have you ever struggled with the prospect of what your life's purpose is? Why others around you seem to moving at an accelerated pace in the right direction, but it seems like God has all but forgot you in the process? Is it possible that God wants you right where you are at this particular moment even if it mean sitting on the bench or simply being a dishwasher or a stay at home mom?

Then I have the perfect movie for you that should help point you in the right direction or even be content with where you are at right now! Pure Flix presents This Is Our Time, a way to seize God's calling! Starring Erin Bethea (Fireproof) as Al and her husband Luke (T.J. Dalrymple) who marry shortly after their graduation from college, and feel the calling of going to India as part of Embrace A Village ministry. This ministry cares for those afflicted with leprosy and their families. Their friends from college Catherine (Kate Cobb), an aspiring financier, who joins a prestigious financial institution determined to make an impact on corporate American; Ryder (Matthew Florida), who lands an impressive job in social media and can't wait to use the powerful medium for a greater good; and Ethan (Shawn-Caulin Young), seemingly the odd man out, who struggles to find his God-given purpose and feels sidelined by God.

""What they all come to learn is that it never really was their time, but always was, always is, God's time.""

This movie is so powerful because there is a sense that we can all relate to a character in the movie. Even those that seem to have it all made, find themselves struggling with some of the business ethical choices in their jobs, so it's not always as green on the other side as some would see. I found myself relating to the character of Catherine because it sometimes means having to make hard choices in your job. I myself, found that leaving a job after ten years despite the prestige and salary that may it hard to give up, required me to simply walk away and never look back. At the time, the decision was a hard one and one I found myself questioning quite a bit during my first year, especially when my family just bought a new home and two incomes were almost required. However, I found with God's assurance, we were able to make it just fine and He paved the way in unpredictable ways, much like He does in all the characters in this movie. Sometimes we have to get to the end of the path before we can see clearly because the whole time we were simply too close to the situation.

I received This Is Our Time by Pure Flix compliments of Flyby Promotions for my honest review and received no compensation for a favorable review. This movie really hit home with me as a stay at home mom for the last ten years now wondering if I was sacrificing what God wanted me to do for something bigger and more impactful. However, after watching this one, I am content with where God has placed me and until such a time that He asks me to move in another direction, I will do my best with what I can. A great family movie with a profound moral message. For those wondering where God's at in your life in any situation, this is the movie for you. I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars.",1365724800,4,3201,4.383838383838384

We have watched a myriad of faith based movies over the years and this is the first one to truly disappoint us. The story went nowhere really, very dull and slow. I would not recommend it to others and certainly not to any who need a message of redemption since it was a plug for charity and this would dissuade and support any unbeliever's argument that Christianity preys upon people's money. However...if there was one good point to being up, it would be that sometimes God makes us wait as we have a purpose not known to us at that time.

5198560,4,B008ZRKIHA,"As another review wrote, I was not expecting this movie to be as meaningful as it was.  This story was full of real life situations real Christians face.  Five young people set out to establish themselves in the world after college graduation.  As with most young people, everything seemed to be rolling right along and looking bright.  Ethan, though, is placed in the position of having to wait on God's timing, which makes him feel a failure because of his perceived disapproval from his father after not being accepted into grad school.  Ethan's inner struggles are painful to watch, especially if you've experienced those periods of waiting for your turn or your time.  Other situations involve grieving the death of a loved one, persecution on the job, having the courage to stand for right in the workplace, leaving all behind to go into full-time missions work, etc.  You'll feel the discouragement, pain, and triumphs of each character as you see how God has a plan for us all in the end.  Worthwhile and thoughtful.",1405123200,,1024,4.844827586206897

5198564,5,B008ZRKIHA,"This movie was done really well and makes you think about what God's plan may be for you vs the plan that you yourself have.

5198565,1,B008ZRKIHA,"I got this movie hoping to be edified by it in the same way that I was with Fireproof, The Printing, Sheffey, etc., but my search for good Christian movies continues and this one I nearly through in the trash.  It was so boring and uninteresting and unrealistic that I only got through about three quarters of it before I just couldn't take it anymore.  Worst of all, it is the best presentation of worldly American Christianity that I have seen yet.  Christ isn't mentioned at all in the portion that I saw, and the characters are only mildly more moral and more modestly dressed than the characters of the hit show ""Friends.""  They act almost exactly like the characters in ""Friends,"" minus the good acting.  It was so obnoxious!  I felt angry for Christ's sake that anyone might think that these people are the way that true Christians are.  What a joke!  What a disappointment!  Movies like this make me wish I was Ammish and didn't have a t.v.  Will somebody please do a movie that is Christ exalting and encouraging to those watching?  Even if the acting is terrible, a movie that has Christ at the heart is worth sitting through (i.e. Flywheel).  Save your money and your time and don't watch this movie.",1390348800,16,1211,4.555555555555555

This movie shows us the different types of emotions different people experience during a loss: Confusion, pain, emptiness, it clouds your judgement if it was a loved one, etc. As a Christian it is hard to understand why God would take someone we love from us. But this movie reminds us that loss is something that will happen but God will NEVER forsake you. He will help you mourn the loss. But we have to MOVE on. We cannot stay depressed, we have to move forward with God. Most importantly we cannot stay angry with him.",1386028800,,591,4.431192660550459

5198583,5,B008ZRKIHA,"This movie realistically portrayed how the loss of someone close, in this case one who seems to personify the spiritual values which we all strive for, can impact our spiritual lives as well as our worldly views.  I especially liked that the ""loser"" turned out to be the one who brought the whole group to healing.  This helps all of us evaluate how our view of ourselves can limit who we become, and how changing that view can remove those limits.",1382745600,2,448,4.518518518518518

The ups and downs of these characters in the story, and the lessons they learn, are truly inspiring!",1379376000,,397,5.03030303030303
5198588,3,B008ZRKIHA,"I thought it was an okay movie.  A bit watered down.  I'm not sure the name of Jesus was even mentioned.  There was one great part when the main character Ethan makes a mini speech about how following God may not always be easy and mentions those in the bible who had hard, difficult lives and deaths, but were still in God's will.  I know I am probably in the minority, but I was a little disappointed to see the role of womanhood as stated in the bible not clearly presented.  It seemed to be fine for one of the main female characters to be seeking her calling in the corporate world.  Titus 2 tells women to love their  husbands and children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed.  This is the woman's main calling.  I wonder sometimes why this is never a worthy goal for a woman in a movie....I am not against a woman ever getting a job, but it seems as if we don't display this as the main goal for women ( as the bible states).  It was a little heavy on boyfriend/girlfriend stuff that seemed to more distract from the story.  It was an okay movie ,but not one we would choose to watch again.  However, if it attracts someone to the ministry that is promoted in the movie, that would be good thing.  I would love for Christian film makers to be bold for Christ and the Bible.  There may come a time when we can't use his name or word, Let's do it now while the door is still open.",1378598400,2,1463,4.178571428571429

5198612,1,B008ZRKIHA,not inspiring as fireproof & courageous. Predictable script. Bad acting. Movie tries too hard to be a Christian movie. Movie did address the concept of why God allows bad things to happen but does not do it well.,1375228800,5,212,4.605263157894737

5198630,3,B008ZRKIHA,"This movie was good.  It had a good message, its God's time not our time.  I was just hoping for a bit more.  It was pretty vanilla.  The actors were kind of bland and the storyline was mediocre.  It seems to me that good Christian movies give you a glimpse of God's greatness.  A reflection, a reminder that we are meant for more than this.  This movie focused on the American college student grads but I thought the story was really in India with the Embrace a Village program.  These are the people that are so amazing.  It seemed like the movie focusing on US college grads was to show how we can make a difference and that is really important for us to learn.  I just had high hopes for this movie with all the 5 star reviews.  I have watched Courageous and To Save A Life a few times and cry each time.  God moving in the character's lives.  This movie just did not live up to its potential.  PS.  I did love the short interaction between the older secretary and the young female towards the end of the movie.

But!  Boy was I ever surprised.  This is not only ""well done""...it is cooked to perfection!!  The whole thing is professionally made from every camera angle to every line given by any of the actors.  Nothing here is week or mis-directed.  Not only is it ""Our time"", it is about time such a fine tuned movie was put out by Christians!!",1370131200,6,505,4.365591397849462

5198637,4,B008ZRKIHA,"When our expectations of life have a head on collision with the reality of life our faith can get tested to its max. In the book The Gospel Centered Woman Wendy talks about the ""prosperity gospel of conservative Christianity"" -- the notion that if we are living for God, doing His will, and following what the Bible says we're supposed to do then our lives will go well and we'll be blessed. I do find that this tends to be the way we thinks as Christians--so how do we respond when we're serving God and tragedy strikes?

This is the center theme to This Is Our Time  which follows the lives of five different students after they graduate from college. Each has great challenges to overcome as they seek what they should be doing and who they should become.

I had mixed feelings on this movie. On the one hand I loved the theme and I especially loved how the amazing ministry of Embrace a Village was highlighted--if you've never heard of it please check it out, wow! The film was very family friendly and the shooting and cinematography was nice, and I enjoyed seeing Erin Bethea  again (the wife on Fireproof).

I don't feel that I can give this movie five stars, however. My hubby, ever the film critic, watched it with me and he commented that the whole movie was very heavy and depressing. While we both realized that there were weighty thing being shown throughout the movie, we also both felt that the need for comic relief in between those scenes just wasn't met by the corny punch lines scattered in here and there. Especially considering other recently released Christian films who also dealt with incredibly difficult topic lines and but managed to get genuinely side splitting scenes in between I feel the bar has now been raised in the Christian film industry. Low budget acting and corny punch lines just don't cut it anymore.

That being said I would overall rate this movie a 4. It definitely delivers on being a family friendly, Christian film and watching it with your older kids could prove to lead to some really valuable discussions about our expectations in life and the difference of the realities and also what God might be calling them to do!",1366934400,8,2169,4.606217616580311

In an age and time when we sometimes face such incredible losses in our lives, it is hard to stay on track with God's will for us.  This movie showed in everything that we do there is a greater purpose.  It was well written and acted.  The message it conveyed was poignant in its speaking of God's will for us and also in talking about Embrace A Village.
