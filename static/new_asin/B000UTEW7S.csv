8214680,5,B000UTEW7S,"I am very pleased with this DVD.  The videos are well-lit and -shot, the music is clear and lovely, and the dancers are terrific.  The music and performances are varied enough to keep your interest, with each couple having a distinctive style.

Side A has two sets of performances.  The first set is at La Viruta, a famous long-standing milonga, and the performances have more of a social-dance improvisational feel but with enough show sensibility and variety to keep interest.  The second set is on stage at the Teatro Astral and so has a more showy choregraphed feel.  Eight couples performed twice.  Some of the performances were balletic or dramatic, some more traditionally heightened social dancing.  A few had comedic element without sacrificing virtuosity.  Time for this side and the other side is about 220 minutes.

Side B returns to the Astral with a mostly different set of couples.  Two of the performances were comedic, one with duelling Charlie Chaplins that was at once hilarious and amazingly imaginative and athletic.  A second and third set of performances were in well-known milongas - Region Leonesa and Confiteria Ideal.  At that last several talented teen couples performed.  The camera setup shows the elegant old venue at its best, with a gleaming tile floor, crystalline lights from a chandelier and other illumination, and stately golden-pearl columns.",1227398400,4,1381,5.134529147982063
