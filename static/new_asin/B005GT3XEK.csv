8472312,3,B005GT3XEK,"David Suchet is a wonderful narrator but some of the ""Leading Experts"" had their own agendas. I found their interpretations difficult to swallow.
Unfortunately, the other DVDs by David Suchet on St. Paul and St. Peter had the same frustrations.",1420761600,2,244,5.125
8472313,5,B005GT3XEK,I have seen other religious DVD's by David Suchet and think he does a superb job in relating Biblical views and scripture. He stays with the original thought and theme of scripture - does not add views of religious groups. Looking forward for more DVD's from him.,1403308800,6,263,4.617021276595745
8472314,5,B005GT3XEK,"Anyone who is interested in both Biblical and Historical knowledge of both the life and area where Jesus grew up will love this series. It's well documented and gives insight to the man and his cultural, sociological background.  Makes a great gift as well as an addition to your own library of knowledge.",1392422400,5,305,4.754716981132075
8472315,5,B005GT3XEK,"I have not done any thing with this . EVERY THING from ordering to getting , every thing was handled very good .",1360108800,,112,3.9130434782608696
8472316,1,B005GT3XEK,"Saw clips from the dramatized sections of this video (a set of music videos called ""The Story"" was created with the clips from this documentary). Wanted to hear the dialogue and searched for the full version as the acting and production was very impressive (if you like silent movies). The documentary was dry and contained too much speculation (to be 'fair'?) There were a few decent speakers (small percentage). The dramatized parts are inaudible (spoken over). They may have been in Arabic or another language. They are truly the stars of this video even if there is no sound. If this video is all there is for these dramatized scenes, it was very disappointing. I tossed it. To see the music videos go to Godtube.com and the best ones are ""Alive,"" ""Empty,"" and ""When Love Sees You,"" all done by major Christian artists.",1339545600,3,823,4.7622377622377625
8472317,5,B005GT3XEK,The acting and scenery is moving and some of the best I have ever seen.  I just wish this was more of a movie than documentary.,1336608000,6,127,3.8846153846153846
8472318,4,B005GT3XEK,"This is a fine documentary production which presents many great historical and cultural insights although I was annoyed by some of the modernist (liberal) theological perspectives presented by a few of the commentators.

Purchasers of this DVD may also like the Jesus Revealed DVD study  series. It uses many of the the same beautifully produced visual dramatization scenes from the Gospels with the addition of the provocative Bible teaching of Andy Frost. This is an excellent tool for anyone wanting to know more about the authentic Jesus.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Revealed-Encountering-The-Authentic-Jesus-Disc-1/dp/B006XF2WG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus Revealed: Encountering The Authentic Jesus (Disc 1)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-Revealed-Disc-2/dp/B007EWNO96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus Revealed (Disc 2)</a>",1334620800,6,935,8.067961165048544
