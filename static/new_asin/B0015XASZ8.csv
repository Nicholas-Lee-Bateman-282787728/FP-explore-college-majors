3148980,5,B0015XASZ8,"American Drug War really shook me up. I think it changed the way I feel about living and breathing in this country and inspired me to act on things that I've always just thought about. It made me very sad in a way, but very enlightened and empowered too. Everyone needs to see this movie. It's affecting all of our lives and no one is talking about it.

It's people like the Booth brothers that can inspire us to become grassroots activists to help people that cannot help themselves. Our government is a big, mean dog and I thank them for being brave enough to stand up to it, and to do it in a way that deserves respect and attention.

I encourage anyone and everyone to purchase this movie.",1207353600,11,693,4.323076923076923
3148981,5,B0015XASZ8,"The Booth bros. provide you with information that you believed might be true but until now you never knew how it was possible. This doc is very well made, you can tell this doc was created without bias and shown through the eyes of your every day American citizen. What is shown on the DVD is very disturbing and raises awareness in to the agendas of what our American Government is doing at the citizens expense.

I first saw this movie on showtime, because it sounded interesting but it was more then I bargained for. Very informative and powerful from the people interviewed for the doc to the people higher up who we trust to do the right thing but are just interested in their own agendas. It shows how people are affected by their own governments decisions. I really can't explain how this doc makes someone feel after they watch it but I will quote my girlfriend after she watched it

The time it must have taken to gather ALL of this information is truly astounding and impressive.  Like an earlier person that rated this documentary, ""I thought it would be an interesting documentary, but the information about the issues was way more than I ""bargained for"" is a great way to describe this.  I first saw it on Amazine Prime and HAD to order the DVD, not only because it was so riveting, but so much information to try to absorb whin the two hours of watching it.  I plan on sharing this with many people I know, as I don't think many poeple have any clue to what's going on with our government any way, much less about the historic chain of events divulged in this documentary.  My thoughts and prayers are with the filmmaker Kevin Booth, not only for the amount of time it took for him to have gathered all of this information, but for his reasons for ""taking on"" this issue and divulging all of the very disturbing actions and all of the coverups that OUR own government was and currently still continues to practice.

Has drug crime been reduced? Plus goes into CIA involvement which was fascinating.  To state the obvious: Perhaps our ""drug war"" money would be better spent on a campaign to educate people the dangers of drugs and to provide help to those addicted, rather than imprisonment.  However, based on the infoemation presented in this film, prisons do profit on the jailing of drug users.  The movie goes into much more.  Highly recommended.",1371686400,,588,4.7254901960784315
3149026,4,B0015XASZ8,"LAPD narcotics officer Mike Ruppert confronts CIA Director Deutch at the public hearings in Los Angeles and the crowd goes wild.

Deutch doesn't know what to say. Deutch claims the CIA is not flying in cocaine and Rupert says he has knowledge they are.

I liked New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. After reelection as governor, Johnson called for the legalization (not the decriminalization) of marijuana. He talked about harm-reduction as the important goal, and he argues that reducing the harm that drugs do can be better achieved in ways other than attempting to lock up all drug users.

I liked the scenes of Amsterdam, where drug use is legal, and marijuana use is half what it is in USA, and none of the drug users interviewed had ever heard of speed.

The most disturbing part for me was the CIA-Contra-cocaine connection, and the destruction of South-central Los Angeles.

I also liked the comparisons of the drug war to the attempted prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s. Sheriff Joe Arpaio was too funny. I hope he watches the film.

So what can be done about the crazy situation we are in? Unlike most people on the planet, here in the USA we elect most of our governing officials. Two presidential candidates, Ralph Nader and Ron Paul, were featured briefly. Each would take national drug policy in a very different direction. In many countries, figures like these two would never be allowed to voice their criticisms of the status quo. But as long as Americans continue to vote for major party candidates, and not take seriously the need for real change, we will get more of the same.",1369094400,2,1595,4.760869565217392
3149027,5,B0015XASZ8,Good documentary. It makes you ponder whether or not drug policy needs a revamp. Brings to light several new perspectives. Makes you think. Worth your time.,1368144000,,156,5.038461538461538
3149028,2,B0015XASZ8,"I wanted to like this.  I generally support drug decriminalization.  On the bright side, the film does spend some time talking about how expensive the drug war is, how many people are needless hurt by the drug war, about the stupidity of the federal govt's position on medical marijuana, etc.

Having said that, one of the biggest obstacles we face is that sane people who want change get lumped in with crackpots like this filmmaker.  This movie is chock-full of stupid conspiracy theories.  One of the most glaring examples: Michael Ruppert actually implies that the invasion of Afghanistan was all about heroin?  Really?  Ruppert is one of the main contributors to this film.  Ruppert is well known for being a crackpot and a nut.  The films insistence on spending a significant chunk of it's time exploring this guys dumb theories hurts the cause much more than it helps.

If we really want to see change in the US and an end to the failed War on Drugs, we need better spokespeople than this.  If you really wanna change peoples minds, we need to focus on the cost and real world affects of the War on Drugs.  This movie comes across as childish and stupid.  It spends it's time taking lame political potshots and expressing paranoid liberal fantasies.  This isn't a Republican or Democrat issue.  Both parties suck when it comes to drugs.  Obama has been no better than Bush who was no better than Clinton, etc.",1367625600,5,1416,4.695121951219512

No one is ever forced to do drugs, it is a choice that these people made on their own. It's use destroys lives and making it legal wouldn't change anything.",1364256000,2,283,4.4423076923076925

3149032,5,B0015XASZ8,"Very good look at the issues of drug use in our country. I am not condoning drug use, but putting drug addicts in jail is not going to stop drug use. We're putting money into jails instead of treatment centers.",1357430400,2,210,4.275
3149033,5,B0015XASZ8,"This documentary did a good job of explaining what the U.S. ""drug war"" is about ... and it's not what most people think it is about.  The drug war in our country is literally the exact opposite of what it's supposed to be and that is by design.  Money laundering from illegal drugs through major American financial institutions (though foreign financial institutions are just as culpable) and an ever increasing private prison population for drug offenses have become such a profitable endeavor that if it were shut down it would render our economy far worse off than it is now -- -- so that means a steady stream of illegal drugs must continue (and more notably, be allowed into the country) in order for the cash to keep flowing into our banks and private prisons.  The documentarian tries to make the case for decriminalizing drugs (mostly marijuana, but some more hard core ones too) similarly to how the Dutch have done it and even flies over to Holland to speak to a local caf shop owner who sells pot at his shop to find out how the city of Amsterdam has done with this experiment since its implementation.  He makes a good case!

The documentary is a little old (2008), but more than relevant since our collective drug use as a nation has grown since then and continues to.  I learned a lot... and was saddened by much of it.  The ""war on drugs"" is an Orwellian term if ever I heard one.  Hopefully, the next generation will see who has truly profited from this mess and work to fix it.

p.s. Google the term ""HSBC fined for drug money laundering"" and an investigative article from the Guardian (UK) will come up from December of 2012.",1347235200,,1643,4.523648648648648
3149034,1,B0015XASZ8,"Well, this filmmaker states at the beginning that he has a bias. This movie is full of half truths and blatant biases. A summary of the movie "" the evil white businessmen and the military industrial complex are oppressing the poor minorities and liberals, also can you please legalize pot because alcohol is bad."" Anyway, the movie is extremely biased and not very informative.",1345334400,4,377,4.90625

3149036,5,B0015XASZ8,"This movie is a very interesting and thoughtful look at the American drug war.  The film maker makes his statement very effectively with a combination of personal stories and interviews.  He also incorporates information from books and news archives.  The documentary  includes interviews with a very wide range of people who have been affected by drugs and the drug war.  I bought it thinking it looked interesting but I got much more than I expected.  It is the best documentary I have seen in years.  Too often there is so much ""fluff"" in films I feel that I have wasted my time on them.  This movie is almost 2 hours long and I was never bored and only found one very short scene to be unnecessary (Joe Rogan smoking marijuana- didn't take away from it but didn't add anything).  I actually wondered how it covered so much in only 2 hours.  I will warn potential that there are some controversial opinions expressed and some very graphic and unpleasant scenes.",1341187200,2,964,4.650887573964497

I would agree that the criminalization of drug use should be reviewed on a case per case basis.  However, the allegations of race completely take the credibility  out of the film very early on.",1340496000,5,334,5.148148148148148
3149038,5,B0015XASZ8,"Fuel for Thought

  Mind altering, addicting drugs are of low economic value. They can be produced by anyone who can grow plants - poppy, marihuana.  Resources are unlimited and available to anyone.

  The incentive to produce mind altering drugs is created by making their USE and SALE  a crime.  It adds an artificial value to an inherently inexpensive product.

  Prohibition of mind altering drugs - including alcohol -  actually promotes production and aggressive ""promotion""  of their use by pushers.  Drugs are sold in schools..

  The act of injuring another person is a crime under our laws. Using mind altering drugs does not injure another person.  It is as much a crime as attempting suicide, suffering from an eating disorder or many other ways of injuring oneself. Addiction often requires medical treatment, not jail time.

  Prohibition of alcohol created crime, fear, untold suffering and death of ""innocent bystanders"". It created unearned wealth and power  - including corrupt political power.

  Prohibition of alcohol did ""not work"", so it was rescinded.

  What will it take for you to support the same logic and ask your government to decriminalize drug use. And remove the incentive for pushing mind altering drugs to children and other easy targets.

  One small country - the Netherlands - can not do it alone in a sea of irrational prohibition.  Once the US takes the lead, the rest will follow. One will have to seek out cheap bars to find these drugs, because the profit incentive has been removed.

  In Afghanistan poppy is grown in record amount. And sold with inordinate profit - because if is used to produce drugs that are ""illegal"" in this country.  The profit is fuel for the destruction  of the free world by medieval religious fanatics.",1337299200,2,1775,4.972508591065292
3149039,5,B0015XASZ8,"I am 24 years old and I knew that there was no coincidence that all my older black male cousins, uncles, father and brothers were all drug dealers in the late 80s, making so much money; I knew it had to be part of a scheme. They generate trillions of dollars and justify this exploitation by deeming them all criminals. You criminalize them all, creating an image of the ultimate evil inside the minds of the ""ideal American"".

The American Drug War: The Last White Hope, was an excellent documentary that exposed the truth about how drugs and the prison system are used to exploit an entire people.
It comes to no surprise that our government is corrupt and could give two f#$%s about the American people. Pure education! Loved it! Thank you for not being afraid to investigate and present us with the truth! Much Respect..",1334793600,3,824,4.605442176870748
3149040,5,B0015XASZ8,"This movie explains the current fervor to eliminate ""illegal"" drugs at any cost. Presented in true Documentary fashion, this is a sobering indictment of our criminal ""justice"" system and the 800 Thousand people, each year, who are ""indoctrinated"" into it. EIGHTY% for simple possession of drugs. Non Violent offenders.

Among the many subjects covered are the link between the Iran Contra's Financial support by the U.S.Government and CIA, and the current drug war and importation and introduction of Million of tons of Cocaine into South Central Los Angeles by way of a co-conspirator in the CIA.
It touches on private prisons, violation of inmates rights by using their labor for free, and the ever-widening net of suspicion cast over every American with the introduction and support of the ""Patriot Act""-in the name of this ""Drug War""
The most destructive document in our lifetime. It allows unrestricted surveillance of any American, for any reason.

It is crafted thoroughly, thoughtfully and extremely well researched. Including many thought-provoking interviews with, among others, Tommy Chong, General Barry McCafery, Judge James Gray and Joe Rogan,Dr. Robert Melameade and the founder of the ""Bloods"". A Los Angeles gang.

Filmmaker Kevin Booth tells a compelling and, often, chilling tale that MUST be seen to be believed.
Inspired by the death of family members and close friends from the effects of ""legal"" drugs, his in-depth assessment is a revelation in film-making.

This information should be on public television on a daily basis. Its importance cannot be emphasized enough.
Unlike others, it has NO particular agenda,other than to highlight the insanity of this war on drugs-and the direct cost to all or liberties.
It presents unadulterated accounts from former DEA agents regarding our country's hand in the importation of Cocaine to destroy the African American community.
Every-single-statement is backed up with indisputable fact.

3149041,5,B0015XASZ8,"This is an excellent film, which gets to the heart of the story why the War on Drugs is just not working.  Thus, the collusion of government with drug war lords is  well documented through extremely credible key policy makers' narratives during a string of presidential administrations.  That the war on drugs is inefficient, wasting tremendous amounts of tax payer dollars and is actually a war on the poor and racially motivated is a major argument of this movie, which the producers make rather well.  I only wish they had integrated such things as the need for socially useful work, more available educational opportunities, and better housing, that is, promoting human rights in general as some of their solutions.  But, one gets that message subtly nevertheless perhaps as it speaks about the absurdity of privatized prisons where their stock market value goes up, when there are more incarcerated, an obvious profit motive to put more in prison.  It was also great how they contrasted Holland's drug policies with those of the USA, noting how the former has a quality of life unparalleled in the USA.[",1329004800,3,1108,4.962162162162162

3149043,1,B0015XASZ8,"A completely incoherent film with no semblance of a logical argument. The filmmaker insists upon regaling the viewer with immaterial anecdotes about his mentally unstable drug-crazed brother, as if that is somehow supposed to support the idea of denouement of the war on drugs. (Drugs destroyed my brother's life and turned him into a raving lunatic. Therefore, drugs should be legalized. Makes perfect sense, I guess?)

Look, I certainly recognize that many elements of the 'war on drugs' are flawed. There is a very credible argument to be made for the legalization of Marijuana and other substances that pose a low threat of addiction and self-harm. However, to suggest, as this documentarian does, that historical overreach in the drug war necessitates relaxation of regulations on dangerous substances like heroin and cocaine that are very adept at turning users into societal leeches is generously absurd.

This could have been a serious documentary that raised some serious and necessary questions about how our government allocates resources to fight the making, trafficking, and consumption of illegal drugs. Instead, as is the norm with leftist propaganda films masquerading as real documentaries, this movie maker started out with a flawed premise (that conservatives and republicans in government want to keep minorities down and will eagerly co-opt their corporate cronies to do so) and then rearranged and distorted various aspects of the war on drugs to bolster his untenable opinion.

Terrorists are created when you invade a country for no reason.
 Two points in this movie which I found interesting were when the former Drug Czar with his twenty billion dollar budget and an army of agents in the field literally ran from a question from Mr. Jones.  Who would follow this guy? And the other point was when sheriff Joe held up the certificate of achievement for the camera.  Take notice of the interesting shape that the badge on the sheet takes on.

3149056,4,B0015XASZ8,"In my opinion, most documentaries, regardless of how they are presented, can't really give a totally fair and unbiased view of the given topic.  I've noticed that a lot of them are usually presented by people who've had a personal experience with the given topic and that experience almost always sets the tone of the film.  As long as you realize this as a viewer, then you can ignore most of the 'flaws' in the film itself and be able to grasp the main theme(s).

Having said that, this is one of the best documentaries on the so called drug war in America that I've seen in years...mainly because of its attempted scope, the tying together of several unrelated happenings that seems to point to the same ends, the number of interviews with a good cross section of people who were involved in the drug business, and the timing...if you believe the statement that Nixon started the latest 'war on drugs' in the 1970s (there were other 'war on drugs' campaigns, like the prohibition on alcohol from the 1920s), then the war has been going on long enough for people to be able to step back and take a really good look at what has happened...and where is it going.

This documentary made me think not only about the present 'war on drugs' that our government is conducting, but how this war can affect other areas of one's life that I previously thought were unrelated to the whole money machine that modern drugs have created (check out the reference to 9/11 made by one of Ricky Ross's pals).  There have been other documentaries on the war on drugs in the past that were thought provoking, and there will more made in the future that will hopefully keep opening people's eyes to the realities of the drug business-I think Kevin Booth's documentary will be noted among one of the better ones because in my opinion he has managed to tie enough strings together to make a powerful statement.",1223424000,2,1889,4.593471810089021

While this is certainly a valuable tool for the attitudinal manipulation of the less enlightened masses, who will eagerly parrot these messages as being representative of authoritative wisdom, they are often, in fact, nothing more than a simplistic panacean smoke screen that serves to obviate a realistic examination of the complex issues involved, by fostering unreasoned opinion.

Director Kevin Booth shows all sides of America's ""War on Drugs"" and its toll on our country. Whether your against drug use or for it, this is a very informative and IMPORTANT documentary to watch. The biggest sticking point of the documentary is that drugs ought to be regulated instead of being made illegal to lower drug use overall in America. An example is the fact that Amsterdam/Holland has 40% less marijuana use compared to the U.S. Also that crystal meth use is virtually obsolete in Amsterdam/Holland whereas in the U.S. its an epidemic.

Alcohol prohibition was a complete failure in the 20s. It increased the use of alcohol while decreasing the age at which people used it. It created an extremely lucrative market for gangsters and a subsequent wave of violence. Drug prohibition, which has been in effect since 1937, is no different. Hundreds of thousands have died in gang violence or run ins with the police. Our prisions are so packed we can't build new ones fast enough. Isn't seventy years of failure long enough for someone to ADMIT prohibition doesn't work? It took thirteen years for alcohol!

And if you can't learn from history, few do, look at Holland. A place where drugs are decriminalized and actually provided by the government in some cases. Drug use is....DOWN, especially among the youth. Drug related crime is almost nonexistent and the rate of addiction is nearly stable.

3149062,4,B0015XASZ8,"Director Kevin Booth does make some effort to show both sides of America's ""War on Drugs"". For example, Booth depicts the devasting effect of drugs like crystal meth, crack and PCP on the lives of addicts. He also includes interviews with anti-drug ""warriors"" like former Clinton drug czar Barry McCafferty. But Booth also correctly recognizes the ""War On Drugs"" as a failed campaign that will never be won. He emphasizes the racist aspects of the drug war as well as it underlying sinister motives of both profit and social control for those in power.

A significant portion of the doc is devoted to explaining the role of the Reagan administration in the importation of cocaine into the USA in the 1980's to covertly fund the Contra's war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. It also decribes how Los Angeles drug dealer, Freeway Ricky Ross, became a contact for a Contra drug exporter and how this led him to becoming a major player in the subsequent crack epidemic.

Booth also includes interviews with drug decriminalization advocates such as Tommy Chong and Jello Biafra. The doc makes a very compelling case against the excessive incarceration of non-violent drug offenders. However, I do wish Booth had focused a little more time on showing the benefits of treatment over imprisonment for addicts.

But still Booth does cover a lot of ground and comes down on the right side of this important issue. I would especially encourage those unsure of their opinion on the drug war to watch this doc as they will likely learn a great deal of new information.

The subject of America's love for mind-altering substances (legal and illegal) is broad and deep enough to provide material for a dozen documentaries, but Kevin Booth does an excellent job of putting together a coherent two-hour film that takes on several aspects of the drug war. I got this movie two weeks ago in the mail and since then have been trying to make every friend and family member watch it.
That there are over a million non-violent people in jail and prison in this country because of the drug war is beyond absurd. But here we are. And there they are. And only a few politicians dare to question the rationality of criminalizing the very human impulse to feel good. Why? Among other reasons: The money that the prison-industrial complex and the alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries lavish on politicians ... and the cut of the action that Wall Street and the gov't takes from the illegal drug trade.

Deutch doesn't know what to say. Deutch claims the CIA is not flying in cocaine and Rupert says he has knowledge they are.

I liked New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. After reelection as governor, Johnson called for the legalization (not the decriminalization) of marijuana. He talked about harm-reduction as the important goal, and he argues that reducing the harm that drugs do can be better achieved in ways other than attempting to lock up all drug users.

I liked the scenes of Amsterdam, where drug use is legal, and marijuana use is half what it is in USA, and none of the drug users interviewed had ever heard of speed.

The most disturbing part for me was the CIA-Contra-cocaine connection, and the destruction of South-central Los Angeles.

I also liked the comparisons of the drug war to the attempted prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s. Sheriff Joe Arpaio was too funny. I hope he watches the film.

So what can be done about the crazy situation we are in? Unlike most people on the planet, here in the USA we elect most of our governing officials. Two presidential candidates, Ralph Nader and Ron Paul, were featured briefly. Each would take national drug policy in a very different direction.

On the bright side, the film does spend some time talking about how expensive the drug war is, how many people are needless hurt by the drug war, about the stupidity of the federal govt's position on medical marijuana, etc.

Having said that, one of the biggest obstacles we face is that sane people who want change get lumped in with crackpots like this filmmaker.  This movie is chock-full of stupid conspiracy theories.  One of the most glaring examples: Michael Ruppert actually implies that the invasion of Afghanistan was all about heroin?  Really?  Ruppert is one of the main contributors to this film.  Ruppert is well known for being a crackpot and a nut.  The films insistence on spending a significant chunk of it's time exploring this guys dumb theories hurts the cause much more than it helps.

The drug war in our country is literally the exact opposite of what it's supposed to be and that is by design.  Money laundering from illegal drugs through major American financial institutions (though foreign financial institutions are just as culpable) and an ever increasing private prison population for drug offenses have become such a profitable endeavor that if it were shut down it would render our economy far worse off than it is now -- -- so that means a steady stream of illegal drugs must continue (and more notably, be allowed into the country) in order for the cash to keep flowing into our banks and private prisons.  The documentarian tries to make the case for decriminalizing drugs (mostly marijuana, but some more hard core ones too) similarly to how the Dutch have done it and even flies over to Holland to speak to a local caf shop owner who sells pot at his shop to find out how the city of Amsterdam has done with this experiment since its implementation.  He makes a good case!

The documentary is a little old (2008), but more than relevant since our collective drug use as a nation has grown since then and continues to.  I learned a lot... and was saddened by much of it.

3383535,5,B0015XASZ8,"Fuel for Thought

  Mind altering, addicting drugs are of low economic value. They can be produced by anyone who can grow plants - poppy, marihuana.  Resources are unlimited and available to anyone.

  The incentive to produce mind altering drugs is created by making their USE and SALE  a crime.  It adds an artificial value to an inherently inexpensive product.

  Prohibition of mind altering drugs - including alcohol -  actually promotes production and aggressive ""promotion""  of their use by pushers.  Drugs are sold in schools..

  The act of injuring another person is a crime under our laws. Using mind altering drugs does not injure another person.  It is as much a crime as attempting suicide, suffering from an eating disorder or many other ways of injuring oneself. Addiction often requires medical treatment, not jail time.

  Prohibition of alcohol created crime, fear, untold suffering and death of ""innocent bystanders"". It created unearned wealth and power  - including corrupt political power.

  Prohibition of alcohol did ""not work"", so it was rescinded.

  What will it take for you to support the same logic and ask your government to decriminalize drug use. And remove the incentive for pushing mind altering drugs to children and other easy targets.

  One small country - the Netherlands - can not do it alone in a sea of irrational prohibition.  Once the US takes the lead, the rest will follow. One will have to seek out cheap bars to find these drugs, because the profit incentive has been removed.

  In Afghanistan poppy is grown in record amount. And sold with inordinate profit - because if is used to produce drugs that are ""illegal"" in this country.  The profit is fuel for the destruction  of the free world by medieval religious fanatics.",1337299200,2,1775,4.972508591065292

Thus, the collusion of government with drug war lords is  well documented through extremely credible key policy makers' narratives during a string of presidential administrations.  That the war on drugs is inefficient, wasting tremendous amounts of tax payer dollars and is actually a war on the poor and racially motivated is a major argument of this movie, which the producers make rather well.  I only wish they had integrated such things as the need for socially useful work, more available educational opportunities, and better housing, that is, promoting human rights in general as some of their solutions.  But, one gets that message subtly nevertheless perhaps as it speaks about the absurdity of privatized prisons where their stock market value goes up, when there are more incarcerated, an obvious profit motive to put more in prison.

(Drugs destroyed my brother's life and turned him into a raving lunatic. Therefore, drugs should be legalized. Makes perfect sense, I guess?)

Look, I certainly recognize that many elements of the 'war on drugs' are flawed. There is a very credible argument to be made for the legalization of Marijuana and other substances that pose a low threat of addiction and self-harm. However, to suggest, as this documentarian does, that historical overreach in the drug war necessitates relaxation of regulations on dangerous substances like heroin and cocaine that are very adept at turning users into societal leeches is generously absurd.

This could have been a serious documentary that raised some serious and necessary questions about how our government allocates resources to fight the making, trafficking, and consumption of illegal drugs. Instead, as is the norm with leftist propaganda films masquerading as real documentaries, this movie maker started out with a flawed premise (that conservatives and republicans in government want to keep minorities down and will eagerly co-opt their corporate cronies to do so) and then rearranged and distorted various aspects of the war on drugs to bolster his untenable opinion.

Having said that, this is one of the best documentaries on the so called drug war in America that I've seen in years...mainly because of its attempted scope, the tying together of several unrelated happenings that seems to point to the same ends, the number of interviews with a good cross section of people who were involved in the drug business, and the timing...if you believe the statement that Nixon started the latest 'war on drugs' in the 1970s (there were other 'war on drugs' campaigns, like the prohibition on alcohol from the 1920s), then the war has been going on long enough for people to be able to step back and take a really good look at what has happened...and where is it going.

This documentary made me think not only about the present 'war on drugs' that our government is conducting, but how this war can affect other areas of one's life that I previously thought were unrelated to the whole money machine that modern drugs have created (check out the reference to 9/11 made by one of Ricky Ross's pals).

Alcohol prohibition was a complete failure in the 20s. It increased the use of alcohol while decreasing the age at which people used it. It created an extremely lucrative market for gangsters and a subsequent wave of violence. Drug prohibition, which has been in effect since 1937, is no different. Hundreds of thousands have died in gang violence or run ins with the police. Our prisions are so packed we can't build new ones fast enough. Isn't seventy years of failure long enough for someone to ADMIT prohibition doesn't work? It took thirteen years for alcohol!

And if you can't learn from history, few do, look at Holland. A place where drugs are decriminalized and actually provided by the government in some cases.

But Booth also correctly recognizes the ""War On Drugs"" as a failed campaign that will never be won. He emphasizes the racist aspects of the drug war as well as it underlying sinister motives of both profit and social control for those in power.

A significant portion of the doc is devoted to explaining the role of the Reagan administration in the importation of cocaine into the USA in the 1980's to covertly fund the Contra's war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. It also decribes how Los Angeles drug dealer, Freeway Ricky Ross, became a contact for a Contra drug exporter and how this led him to becoming a major player in the subsequent crack epidemic.

Booth also includes interviews with drug decriminalization advocates such as Tommy Chong and Jello Biafra. The doc makes a very compelling case against the excessive incarceration of non-violent drug offenders.

The subject of America's love for mind-altering substances (legal and illegal) is broad and deep enough to provide material for a dozen documentaries, but Kevin Booth does an excellent job of putting together a coherent two-hour film that takes on several aspects of the drug war. I got this movie two weeks ago in the mail and since then have been trying to make every friend and family member watch it.
That there are over a million non-violent people in jail and prison in this country because of the drug war is beyond absurd. But here we are. And there they are. And only a few politicians dare to question the rationality of criminalizing the very human impulse to feel good. Why? Among other reasons: The money that the prison-industrial complex and the alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries lavish on politicians ... and the cut of the action that Wall Street and the gov't takes from the illegal drug trade.

Chang got a raw deal no matter how one looks at it but irregardless nothing will change although I did see some local federal crimes that certainly tripped minimum mandatories and the indicted were sentenced so far below the guidelines there is no way one could get that much downward departure, heard that was going to start happening on first time non-violent, which was exactly the case, so maybe progress???",1426550400,,424,4.888888888888889
