8316265,5,B001KVZGH0,"I was so glad to stumble on this documentary.  It's a piece of history I've never known much about, and because I'm from the area of Western NY where this history took place, I was curious to learn more.  The story is charmingly told in a way that my whole family enjoyed, and the lady that went to Holland and tells the whole story of the Peacock Papers is an inspiration.
As a homeschooling family, we're always on the lookout for ways to make local history interesting, and we think this DVD is a treasure!  I tracked down the website of the man that made the documentary: [...]  He has a TON of other materials on his website, mostly videos for download on a bunch of stories about local history, especially the Erie Canal.  We LOVED the story of ""Sneakers"", the 80 year old man that walks the Erie Canal checking for leaks!  We've favorited the site, and highly recommend it, along with this DVD.  Great work!  Make more!",1226448000,,926,4.437869822485207
