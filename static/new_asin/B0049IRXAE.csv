It is a wonderful insight into her creative process and allows you to meet all of the people who contribute to her artistic process while watching them work.
I highly recommend!",1294876800,4,250,4.456521739130435

On the strength of primarily one single song (""1234"") that was used for an iPod commercial, multi-talented Feist broke through in 2007 with her album ""The Reminder"", which is her second album, after 2004's outstanding ""Let It Die"" album. Feist toured relentlessly to promote ""The Reminder"", and now we finally get a document from that tour. But did we?

""Look At What The Light Did Now"" (DVD 145 min; and CD 59 min.) starts with the 80 min. movie of the same name, and if you think this is a tour documentary, you are sadly mistaken. It is instead a deeply subjective and ""artistic"" look at how the album came about, intermixed with interviews of the people involved (typical conversation: what about the album cover? should Feist be on it? and if so, how?), and with the occasional clip of a performance (usually part of a song, but not the whole song). The movie is something I doubt I will ever watch again, to be honest. Not engaging enough and frankly not interesting enough. The DVD extras (65 min.) are a different story. They include the full versions of some of the songs you saw in the movie, including a great ""Limit To Your Heart"", a crazy ""This One Jam"" (featuring Chilly Gonzalez), 2 short movies (the 15 min. ""The Water"" and a great 5 min. ""Departures"", with a clever subplot tied to the ""My Moon My Man"" video shoot), and the 4 video singles from the album, including of course ""1234"" but also ""My Moon My Man"", ""I Feel It All"" and ""Honey Honey"". In all, I really enjoyed the DVD extras, although I only wished there were more of the live performances from the tour. The CD (13 tracks; 59 min.) compiles many of the live tracks seen on the DVD, and that's great, as now it really feels like the live CD that the DVD coulda-shoulda been. But beware: tracks 9 through 12 are NOT Feist tracks as such, instead they are solo piano pieces from Chilly Gonzales, based on Feist songs (for example ""1234"" sounds unrecognizable). I happen to enjoy them quite a bit actually. The last track (also the last scene in the movie) is the Feist duet with Little Wings of the title track, which really sounds nice.

In all, this is quite a mixed bag. I don't care much for the movie, but I really like the live tracks on the DVD and the CD, and in fact I find myself playing the CD more than the DVD. Truth be told, I like Feist's ""Let It Die"" album better than ""The Reminder"". I saw Feist on the Reminder Tour when she visited the Bonnaroo Music Festival, and really enjoyed her set, which of course was heavy on ""Reminder"" tracks but she also play a number of tracks from her first album.",1293840000,15,2641,4.407786885245901
4290151,2,B0049IRXAE,"It was really disappointing to find out that Feist and her goon-squad all take hipsterism to these almost unprecedented, self-indulgent levels.

Needless to say, I purchased this documentary hoping for it to, well you know: MEET THE DESCRIPTION that was provided when marketed to me. But it did not. This is not a movie documenting them being in the studio creating the album. There was a small 15 minute piece of them in the ""studio"" working on the album. But even that was clustered with pretentious dialogue and clips of them recording on the outside terrace of some old French mansion. So unnecessary. Like the rest of the film. This film is not informative about the writing process or the musical creation of the album itself. It's a stoic (almost dismissive) look at their approach towards music in general. This film is littered with absolutely unnecessary art house, impressionistic, film tactics. Close ups, picture burns, weird noises, photographs, cascades of handwritten notes, etc. C'mon. If you MUST be artsy, do it on the album or the stage show STRICTLY. Don't do it on the album, the stage show and then on the documentary that is documenting the album and the stage show. It's too much. Very self-indulgent and in all honesty made me dislike Feist a little. I wanted an HBO look at this album. Not an IFC look.

The execution of this film left a sour taste in my mouth. In fact, I am watching the end of it right now and I have been hearing a sustaining white noise for about 3 minutes, and am looking at some horribly distorted, warped video clip of um... what appears to be Feist laying on a crowd of people? She also just did a voice-over and used the word 'mosaicing.' Which isn't a word. She actually just said 'onioning' too. Which isn't a word. Ok, this film isn't even over yet. It just keeps going and going and going.

Lots of artsy collages and old, warped videos, with sleep inducing voice overs about their musical philosophy. I could easily take a nap during this documentary, and as a musician (who will remain nameless) that is not good.

4290152,5,B0049IRXAE,"We say this film at the UC Berkeley Film Archive Theatre.

It was unexpected in its delivery

It was an art piece for sure.  The process of making an album and the people who collaborated were like a story unfolding page by page.
Its about the process.

8419110,5,B0049IRXAE,"Let me start be saying this: The live album that comes with it is spectacular. On it, there are most of her ""top hit"" songs that everyone loves, but also, a few covers and such. It's really wonderful, if you love Feist as much as I do.

Needless to say, I really enjoyed the documentary. But this documentary isn't for the average Joe. It is very abstract, obscure, and very bizarre. Some may call it meaningless ridiculousness, but I for one appreciate abstract screenplay. If you are expecting your typical interview, in-the-studio type documentary, you can find that somewhere else. With similarities to dadaism, this contemporary film aims to be strange, but again. I love that about it. As an artist myself, I enjoy it all, and consider it highly inspiring.

Honestly, when I watched it, I paused it to make dinner, and could not wait to get back to the couch and watch it.
Just be warned: It is very, very artsy.",1363132800,,918,4.625766871165644

8419115,1,B0049IRXAE,"The reviews here make me glad I didn't watch the DVD.  I'm not surprised most are calling it a boring, self-indulgent mess.  Feist seems to be developing a real problem.

I saw her live three times, starting around the time Let It Die came out, when it was just her and her computer loop machine.  It was a good show, with only two songs marred by audience participation antics.  By the Reminder tour, in a venue approximately 10 times the size, her show had become more of a circus than a music concert.  There was someone diddling with an overhead projector, numerous audience participation gags including her conducting segments of the audience waving their cell phones around, a little girl tap dancing, lots of uninteresting goofing around between songs, etc...

The musical experience itself suffered terribly.  Her antics encouraged the audience to levels of rude talking and playing with cell phones I have rarely seen at a show, and some of the songs were ruined by the goofball carnival context, particularly the quiet, more emotionally subtle ones.  Some were even played in the lazy, shambling way you hear them played on this CD, which makes them all sound nearly the same.  I can't see why it was released.  She has much better material available on bootlegs and on-air radio performances.  Try her old set on KCRW, for instance.

Feist has amazing vocal and songwriting talent, but if she doesn't grow up and start respecting it, and her audience, it will all go to waste.",1313107200,3,1487,4.807086614173229
