8636887,4,B001OMT61C,"Pedrotti's ""Tutti in Maschera"" is indeed a rarity, but a worthy revival, done for the first time in the modern era (in this performance) in the small Ligurian town of Savona in Italy, and later at the Wexford festival in Ireland.  The story is a ""remake,"" to use a film term, of Rossini's ""Il Turco in Italia.""  Pedrotti, almost unknown today, has written charming music for this farce, the best being the trio of the three comic males ""in maschera""--in costume at a masked ball.  The score (1856) sounds like early Verdi with bows to Donizetti, or more obscurely, the Ricci brothers of ""Crispino e la Comare.""  The performance on video is adequate and sometimes amusing as is the simple unit set.  The singers are all up to their tasks.  One can understand why the opera was a hit in its day.  Anyone who loves nineteenth century Italian opera should not be disappointed.",1261180800,5,872,4.660130718954249
