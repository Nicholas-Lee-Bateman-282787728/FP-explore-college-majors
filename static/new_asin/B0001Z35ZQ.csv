8018438,2,B0001Z35ZQ,The really needs to be re-written and all the diagrams and artwork re-drawn. A mess. A lot of the material is way out of date.,1449100800,,126,4.08
8018439,5,B0001Z35ZQ,Very clear and straight forward. The video version is very good also. Anyone who wants to get involved in SR should take time to get a good foundation of the science behind the Art.,1383350400,,181,4.352941176470588
8018440,5,B0001Z35ZQ,This is what I have been looking for. Very easy to understand everything. Great product for anyone interested in doing this professionally or as a side job.,1264550400,,156,4.814814814814815
8018441,3,B0001Z35ZQ,"This is a great place to start if you're not sure what all those knobs do.  There are also some wiring tips and sections about some of the off board gear and the principle of use.

If you've been running sound for some time you won't find much here you don't know but there will be a few tips here that I found useful.

Gain structure is probably the most important thing you can learn about sound and this book and/or video does a good job covering it.",1231718400,,453,4.125
8018442,5,B0001Z35ZQ,"This book has tons of information.  It really explained a lot about running live sound, especially for someone who knew little about it before hand.  I'd recommend this as a first book for someone looking for information on live sound.",1225756800,,235,4.85
8018443,2,B0001Z35ZQ,"I am a Mexican audio engineer with a lot of experience in the studio, but not to much of it in live reinforcement. I bought this dvd to get an insiders view of a live event situation, but I only got some very basic principles. The problem is that if you don't know anything about audio, then you probably won't understand many of the concepts because they don't take the time to explain most of them. They talk of the components and problems like if you already know what they are talking about. So that would make this dvd unsuited for a beginner. And if you have atleast once in your life been at a Live event at the front of house working with a professional engineer, then you probably do know what they are talking about to the extent that you don't need to watch this dvd.

The conversations between the two engineers are very sinthetic, like on an infomercial. And most of it is boaring.

I for one, am very used to miking instruments, but I wanted to know wich techniques where  better for a live situation. I also wanted to know more of how to run the event once it started. But this dvd does not talk about miking techniques, it talks about how to unload your truck, how to do the conections that this perticular engineer uses, how to set up the equipment in the manner that this engineer likes, and how to run a sound check like this guy does. It totally skips things like how to set the amplifier level, or how to run a show once it started, or what to do when there is more than one band in a single event(how to handle the change of bands), and it doesn't even talk about speaker placement.

So if you are a musician or have a band and already have some fundamental audio knowledge, then this dvd may help you set your PA system in most of your gigs. But if you wanted some deeper knowledge of Live Sound Reinforcement or lack any audio know how,  do not buy this dvd.

Today I am starting to read the book, I promise I will post a review as soon as I finish it.",1185148800,6,1976,4.200527704485488
8018444,5,B0001Z35ZQ,"I use this as a training aid for new audio volunteers.  It is a lot easier than reading a book for most folks.  I learned a few things too, but then live audio isn't my profession.  I recommend it, and I'll probably watch it from time to time as a refresher.  I could really appreciate a set of these as a training series covering more topics in greater detail.

If I could return the other DVD I got (""How To Mic a Band For Ultimate Live Sound"") for another copy of the ""Live Sound Reinforcement"" DVD, I'd do so.  The folks in training who got to see both DVDs all agreed that ""Live Sound Reinforcement"" was several times better.",1170288000,3,630,4.2521008403361344
8018445,5,B0001Z35ZQ,"This DVD provides and excellent treatise on PA Systems and how they work for your band. Practically every aspect of the PA System is demonstrated, with Dave the sound engineer explaining and demonstrating all the various components and information on how to set them up. Brad Smiley is the host, and he provides insights and common questions and solutions as Dave goes over various aspects, from  microphone types and how and where they go, to mixers, amps, speakers...the entire gear setup! The DVD runs over 2 hours of practical demonstrations, and even uses a band with each instument getting the explanation of their respective placement in the PA setup. The chapter include: (1) Setting up getting connected (2) Tuning the PA (3) Amplifying the band (4) The soundcheck (5) electrical problems (6) Mixing (7) The Field Segment (8) The Wrap. This DVD is perfect for all you aspiring sound techs and players want to learn the in's and out's of PA setup. The diagrams and examples are very well done as well. This is RATED a HIGHSIERRABASSPLAYER MUST BUY! Go AMAZON!",1156118400,3,1067,4.895027624309392
