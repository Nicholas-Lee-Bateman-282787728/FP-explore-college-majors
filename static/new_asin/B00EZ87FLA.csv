5958233,5,B00EZ87FLA,It adds a load of support for what I have been saying for 25 years.  The Reason Foundation is consistently above the rest when it comes to critical thinking and informed opinion.,1385856000,,178,4.5625
5958234,3,B00EZ87FLA,"It's mediocre, not bad, not good, if you've already made up your mind on the issue of the war on drugs this film isn't going to persuade you one way or the other.",1384387200,,162,3.9393939393939394
5958235,5,B00EZ87FLA,Very powerful and moving. This is an amazing documentary of not just the war on drugs in the United States and Mexico but the flaws inside the criminal justice system. This film sheds light on the unintended consequences of the drug war in such a way that everyone can learn from it.,1383523200,,283,4.461538461538462
5958236,4,B00EZ87FLA,This so called drug war is nothing more than a holocaust in slow motion that targets poor and communities of color!,1383264000,3,115,4.523809523809524
5958237,5,B00EZ87FLA,"America's Longest War will change the debate about America's unsuccessful war on drugs.  In this film, we see the true costs of the war on drugs in the lives lost through murder and punitive incarceration.  This is not a ""we should be allowed to get high"" film--it is an educational film with a straightforward explanation about the negative results of drug prohibition.",1380067200,14,370,4.951612903225806
8610707,5,B00EZ87FLA,Good documentary about the black comedy of the American drug war.,1421625600,,65,5.0
8610708,3,B00EZ87FLA,"I'm a proponent for freedom but having watched this a few weeks ago, I can't even remember anything about it.",1416614400,,109,4.5
8610709,5,B00EZ87FLA,"Kudos to Reason, very well done film! Every American needs to see this film right now, before it is too late, this is just too important. This film is a valuable resource for those who are new to this issue and proposed solutions as well as to those those very familiar with this issue and who think they've heard it all.",1408320000,,321,4.278688524590164
8610710,4,B00EZ87FLA,This is a good over view to see how the war on drugs is just a war on the U.S. Citizen and must watch.,1403481600,,102,3.2916666666666665
8610711,5,B00EZ87FLA,I reall enjoyed this documentary on the prohibition of narcotics. Everybody should see this one. It is an eye opening film.,1399420800,,123,4.904761904761905
8610712,5,B00EZ87FLA,"I like this film's trailer, i was going to get it but it is not available in HD. this should be on netflix.",1397347200,,107,3.6956521739130435
8610713,5,B00EZ87FLA,"The opening sequence is clearly disturbing.  This video chronicles the really stupid waste of lives and resources being expended in the ""War on Drugs""  Our government at work and it does not matter whether it is D or R, its all bad.",1396656000,,232,4.5
8610714,4,B00EZ87FLA,"This documentary makes a convincing case that the War on Drugs is an expensive failure that has driven up the prison population, racialized the justice system and made drugs more powerful and if anything cheaper than ever before. Nothing you didn't know [unless you have been stoned since 1968], but its a good update to the PBS Frontlline special of approximately a decade ago. Someone watching it with me claimed it was liberal propaganda so as it's produced by conservative libertarians I guess there is something here to annoy everyone, Worth your money, and a speedy delivery [from the Reason Foundation].",1388016000,,610,5.0495049504950495
8610715,5,B00EZ87FLA,"This documentary was very well organized, factual and too the point. It is a bit graphic at times but then so is this tragedy we call our National Drug policy",1387411200,,158,4.3
8610716,1,B00EZ87FLA,"Poor voice quality and absolutely nothing new.  A  complete and irritating waste of time and money on one of the most urgent issues of our time,,",1387238400,,145,4.538461538461538
