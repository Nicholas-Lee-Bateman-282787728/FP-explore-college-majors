2414035,5,B000BCGN4Y,"Whether you are Jewish or not, this is an incredible film to see. The filmmaker was lucky enough to find members of this brigade before they died of old age. They each had a courageous story to tell--not to be missed. Its amazing this story wasn't told before by others who documented WWII.",1256515200,11,290,4.490566037735849
2414036,3,B000BCGN4Y,"I never knew there was a All-Jewish Brigade in WWII. Religion or race do not affect one's ability to fight. Everyone is just afraid of Jews. Once taught how to be soldiers,they were quick learners and gleaned all the knowledge their teachers had to give. Their assignments were not of too much importance until their last assignment and what they did when the war in Europe was over. Look at the Jewish State of Israel today. They have the best fighting team in the world, the best spy network, they are on constant alert or they would be driven into the sea!",1208304000,11,559,4.490196078431373

2414043,5,B000BCGN4Y,One of the best documentaries on a little known episode in Israeli history.  A great addition to any DVD collection on Jewish history.,1425686400,,134,4.826086956521739
2414044,5,B000BCGN4Y,"Riveting account of the extraordinary story of this brigade which was under the command of the British army in World War II, so little known before this documentary.
A very human story of perseverance and ultimate triumph and survival this is very watchable and well told, and brings this piece of recent history alive.",1414108800,,319,4.925925925925926
2414045,5,B000BCGN4Y,"This is an amazing documentary about the Israeli heroes of World War II, who with the unwitting help of the British provided hope and material aid to thousands of refugees and later led the successful fight for the Jewish state. A must see!",1337731200,9,240,4.604651162790698
2414046,5,B000BCGN4Y,"We screened this film in the presence of friends,Christians, Muslims and Jews.
They all felt that this should be seen by all high schools and everyone, as it shows1/  a side of the Holocaust that many do not know, the camps were liberated, but what happened to teh rescapees was horrendous,
  2/ a side of the Jews that not everyone knows: they did fight back
  3/ the group of Jews under the Israeli flags who took the war in their own hands,fighting the war against the NAzi and mostly helped escapees from the camps get to a homeland, a place where they were wanted, Palestine, now Israel.
The English did all they could to keep the Jews from reaching their homeland.

IT SHOWS AN ARMED JEWISH RESISTANCE TO THE NAZIS THAT WE  ONLY SEE THROUGH THIS MOVIE.",1325980800,16,758,4.489051094890511
2414047,5,B000BCGN4Y,I thought that this was an excellent documentary that shed light on a group of men that are all heroes.  They changed the course of Israel and gave hope to a people who had lost their will to live.  Highly recommend.,1290988800,8,216,4.2439024390243905
8085300,5,B000BCGN4Y,"Excellent documentary. The Jewish soldiers themselves, describing their roles and activities, 50 years later. Heroic, if not always strictly kosher. Fighting in the war, then forming vengeance squads against hiding German officers, then extraordinary efforts to find and help Jewish refugees and send them to Israel. Very, very moving.",1516406400,,335,5.857142857142857

8085304,5,B000BCGN4Y,"This was a revelation to me. I had no idea that Jewish men from Palestine organized into a Brigade fighting in Italy against the Nazis during WW2.
The story of retribution after the was uplifting that these men went  thruout Europe searching for Gestapo and SS , and exacted appropriate punishment. Also the Haganah organized cells of these men to go thruout Europe after the war to bring survivors and children to Palestine.",1504742400,2,425,4.821917808219178
