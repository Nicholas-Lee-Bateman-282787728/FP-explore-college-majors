2565365,5,B000FH8TZ6,"..it's hard to stop watching!  I'd give the first and second one 5 stars, the third one maybe 4.5.  It was as intriguing and nerve-wracking as the first two but seemed a bit unbeleivable in a few places which I won't go into.  This set is the one to buy though.  If you liked the first one (and it's hard not to), rest asssured the ones that follow keep up the pace.  With these 3 films you  enter the 'pusher' world from the perspective of 3 somewhat different characters.  The main character in Pusher II had played a supporting role in Pusher I.  He's excellent in the second movie as well.  In Pusher III, we get to step into Milo's life - Milo also played the drug lord (and very well I might add) in Pusher I.

Although the product picture shown on this Amazon site doesn't seem to have any quote reviews on the case, my copy does.  From the New York Times, ""The Pusher films pull no punch.  They're a knock out.""  From Variety Magazine, ""Cult status on dvd is assured.""  And as shown on this Amazon review, the review from the New York post which (correctly) compares Pusher to early films by Scorcese.

These films are in Dutch I think and subtitled in English.  Don't let that put you off.  Subtitles don't detract from a riveting and harrowing ride.",1206144000,,1259,4.357758620689655
2565366,5,B000FH8TZ6,"I can't recommend these films enough. Strong acting is backed up by innovative filmmaking to create a world that moves too fast for it's characters. Everyone is a victim in this sordid tale of whores, violence and drugs.

These movies where a huge hit at the Sydney Film Festival last year. Do yourself a favour.",1179619200,,312,4.672727272727273
2565367,4,B000FH8TZ6,"It's very provacative yet humane look into the life of several characters.

From human trafficers to petty criminals. It's a must see.",1168300800,,134,5.090909090909091
2565368,5,B000FH8TZ6,"The Pusher Trilogy is the anti-gangster film in very much the same way as Unforgiven was the anti-western. Nicholas Winding Refn has stripped down the gangster lifestyle and revealed it for what it really is: brutal, unforgiving, and unglamorous. The gangsters in these films don't live in mansions; they live in dirty apartments. They don't have parties in expensive clubs; they use run down restaurants.

Each film has its own main character who has to deal with what ends up being a catastrophically escalating series of events. The first film follows Frank, a drug dealer who runs into trouble when a deal goes sour. The second film features Mads Mikkelson (the recent ""Casino Royale"" James Bond villain), who plays an incredibly tragic figure; the film plays on ""son tries to win his father's affection"" themes, while simultaneously subverting them. The final film follows Milo, a drug kingpin who is propelled into a series of tragic choices when a shipment of cocaine doesn't come in as planned.

The three films are all great; a bit on the short side, but very effective. Many critics seem to think the second one is the strongest and I tend to agree with them, although the third film, ""I Am The Angel of Death,"" has almost the same level of pathos. If you are a fan of films like ""Scarface,"" ""City of God,"" or ""The Sopranos"" (not a film, I know), then definitely give this one a look! The DVDs are in Danish (mostly) with English subtitles and Nicolas Refn gives great commentaries on films 2 and 3 in English.",1167350400,22,1520,4.7320754716981135
2565369,4,B000FH8TZ6,"It's true, we've all seen crimes-go-wrong scenarios before. However, writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn does a wonderful job of focusing his camera on single characters in each film and bringing out the drama of crooks and pushers getting in over their head in some of the worst days of their lives.

In Pusher, drug middleman Frank tries to sort out a mess when he winds up owing too much to local drug kingpin Milo.

Pusher II plays like an Oedipal tragedy minus the mom, with Frank's friend Tonny taking center stage. Tonny gets out of jail and tries to ingratiate himself into the crime business of his cruel father with predictably disastrous results.

Pusher III returns to Milo, an important character in each of the previous films, as he ages and is challenged by new blood in the drug business and new challenges as he negotiates his daughter's 25th birthday party, her wanting to get in on the action, bad drug deals, prostitution and murder.

All three films play perfectly together, with recurring characters, similar themes and believable violence. The criminals are humanized in a way that doesn't let audiences off the hook, as with Trainspotting's reluctantly violent druggies. These are the dealers with cool heads who have chosen this line of work and do terrible things. Yet, at the end of the day or week, Winding Refn has let us walk in their shoes enough to see the fallibility and humanity in what 90 minutes before we might have regarded as unconscionable evil. If you want to sympathize with these characters, you'll have to admit you see a little darkness in yourself, too.

P.S. The tale of how Pusher II and III came to be is almost as cool as the films. It's covered in the documentary Gambler here, which follows him and his associates as they struggle to put together funding for the two films, not to get paid, but just to break even and climb out of moviemaking bankruptcy. Also cool are two featurettes explore how Winding Refn picked amateurs or almost-amateurs for most of the gritty roles in the last two films.",1163376000,29,2050,4.763380281690141

2565379,1,B000FH8TZ6,"Ugh! It was not what I expected from the reviews that I read prior to ordering!!! I wish they had been more honest & descriptive with DETAILS about the amount of subhuman activities taking place!! I usually would not order things based on this particular subject/theme, but the reviews that I read on here made it sound ""AWESOME""& I really wanted to buy this because of Mads Mikkelsen, since I really like his acting! Well, it was HIS section (Disc # 2) that was the MOST REPULSIVE!!!! Apparently, in Denmark, it is customary to not have ANY morals WHATSOEVER!!!!! The amount of sex/nudity in #2 disc was most offensive & totally unnecessary!!!
It could/should have been labeled as X-rated! For example, in one scene, there was a small gathering for a WEDDING/RECEPTION & they were all seated @ a table @ a restaurant, in a family setting & then all of a sudden this gyrating stripper starts undressing to pulsating music & spreading everything, even in front of women & children!!! EGAD!!!! REALLY? At a WEDDING?!?!!  These Danes are loonies!!!  Had I been warned about things like this, I would NOT have bought it for sure. It seems that in Denmark, EVERYONE also uses drugs, (even mothers with newborns!)  & since some have been legalized, almost everyone in this Trilogy has to get money from others who owe them & then it gets downright brutal!!! Then, due to human trafficking, a couple of pals even resort to hanging people upside down & field dressing them like an Elk!!! (Disc #3)......Guts spattering to the floor & then going in the garbage disposal etc!!!  I guess this IS the reality of the subject @ hand!!! I just wish the reviews had the graphic details that made me wish that I had NOT gotten it!!! Men will LOVE this I'm guessing, but even as a tomboy growing up, this still made me sit there with my mouth hanging open, not knowing WTF would happen next. It IS suspensful & dramatic & will hold your attention, IF you can keep from gagging & barfing!!! I'm thinking ""Scarface"" is a good comparison to this trio. I'm actually throwing mine away!!! I won't even give or sell this because it BELONGS in the garbage, it is THAT harsh!!!
And, yes, I know this is how it probably is in a ""Pusher's life, so lesson learned on my end. Not necessary to comment back to me because It's just ""NOT for me""!!! Of course, it had tons of cussing & violence, but I can handle the cussing & some of the violence, but it got too gruesome even for me. I'm surprised Mads' wife doesn't lose her mind, but this is their culture & totally acceptable to them. Thank GOD that I live here in the good old USA!!!!!!!!!!!! If it ever gets like Denmark, I'll pack my bags & leave here too. Bleh!!!!!!!!!!!",1423267200,,2696,4.529774127310062

2565381,5,B000FH8TZ6,"Pusher 3- what a great film. The other two Pushers are ok, but they can't touch the awesome scope and genius that is Pusher 3. Milo is a great character who flows through this movie like a fish in water. I only bought this trilogy because I saw Pusher 3 on Netflix. Pusher 2 is the second best in the series. Tonny is a complete idiot, but we can all empathize because we have moments of complete stupidity as well. Pusher 1 is the weakest and least interesting, but since it began the style of film for these other movies, it has RESPECT. Frank is a jerk and deserved what he got.",1419292800,,581,4.196428571428571

Beautifully shot, I love spotting the 90's Alternative bands posters in this trilogy (The Nixons Foma Album poster for one) Pusher III is the most hard hitting and i felt extremely sorry for Milo.

2565389,5,B000FH8TZ6,"NWR'S Danish epic crime trilogy. After seeing Drive,Vahalla Rising and his newest Only God Forgives. I've been anticipating his renowned and breakthrough Pusher Trilogy. And boy it lived up to my every expectation and now puts NWR as my second favorite film maker after Tarantino and just bumped in front of Takashi Miike. With the Original Pusher being his debut film it reminds me of QT'S Reservoir Dogs although not similar in any way it was just a low-budget visceral masterpiece that launched his career and is every bit as impressive of a debut film as Reservoir dogs. The sequels are equally as good this is the first time where I cannot figure out which film of a trilogy is my favorite. And the way 2 and 3 shift focus on 2 of the supporting characters from the original is sheer brilliance. The first film is definatly the most frenzied and fast paced which follow's low-life addict/pusher Frank played with desperate brilliance by Kim Bodia has he scrambles around over a week's period of time trying to gather up a very large debt which he owes to the chilling and ruthless drug lord Milo(my favorite Pusher character)man does Zlatko Buric just own this role almost like Gandolfini with Tony Soprano. Pusher 2 focuses on Tony played amazingly by Mads Mikkelson who gets out of prison and his loathed by his crime lord ice cold father,can't shake his drug addiction to anything he can get his hands on,and looking at being a father himself. The most emotional and deep of the three. Then Pusher 3 focuses all on Milo who is trying to maintain his grip on the underworld,fix a debt with some slimy Albanians,stay clean,and preparing his daughters birthday,he is far more human and empathetic in this one then the first 2 where we just see him in total control and a take no prisoners like character where in 3 he has to balance his underworld life and his home life the most graphically violent of the 3 as where 2 has the most graphic sexual scene i've ever seen in anything but porn. These films are not for the easily offended or the sqeamish very violent,bleak,and all around ugly. Thats what the life of gangsters,drug dealers and junkies are like and NWR really doesn't hold back and these three films are pure gems and are not to be missed. Now don't expect anything like scorcese or Guy Ritchie these films are hard-core,frenzied camera work and not meant to be polished Hollywood films. But NWR truly is a master writer/director and these films are completly his baby's and must see's for fans of extreme cinema.",1385424000,,2531,4.689887640449438

I decided to keep the trilogy set and wrote Magnolia an email explaining how I purchased the trilogy and the 1st disc just won't play. They were quick to respond with an apology and within a week they sent me a replacement copy of the 1st Pusher movie which played perfectly. The Pusher movies are awesome and I'm glad I was finally able to see all 3.

The latter 2 might have been less boring and more tolerable had this been a tv series where they cut it into 30 min chunks.  So much boring going on - the 3rd one especially with all the time at the birthday party, then all that time with him just sitting there with the 2 guys and girl for the human trafficking - like I really need 15minutes of this movie is just him going to get them food and bring it back !?!  And watching some of the extras included - they might not want to admit just pulling people off the street to do the acting and not getting actual actors.  They say it because they think they did a great job...........not.",1375142400,,781,4.1118421052631575
2565394,5,B000FH8TZ6,"Who'd have thought it; a set of gangster films set in Denmark?! Most people outside of Denmark think Lego, Danish pastries and bacon, and that's about it!

Anyway, I saw the first of the trilogy a good few years ago now, and really enjoyed it. I was surprised that there had been two new films with some of the same characters from the original movie.

The first movie is about Frank, and a drug deal that goes wrong, and, more and more, Frank finds himself in a pickle, and things go from bad to worse. We also meet Milo, a scary ganglord, and Tonny, a sort of bald-headed loser and friend of Frank, who ends up getting a battering from Frank. This is a really good movie.

The second movie is about Tonny, who is played by the excellent actor Mads Mikkelsen, in the first two films. He has got out of jail and finds he is about to be a father; he is hardly good father material. Well, things go from bad to worse for Tonny too, and he ends up in one unhappy experience after another. This is also a good movie.

The Third movie is about the ganglord Milo, who is in all three movies. This is about an aging gangster who finds that he and his territory is being encroached upon; and he doesn't like it. It also involves his daughter's marriage, and we see Milo juggling his square world with his underworld, and a drug addiction, and like a juggler he tries to manage all three; not too successfully as it stands. This is also a shocker, as you'll find out when you watch it!!! Not for the squeamish in any way!!!

So, this sheds some new light on Denmark, but these are excellent films that transcend this little-known corner of Europe, and for my money rate as some of the best gangster/underworld dramas ever made.",1370476800,2,1718,4.339563862928349

UPDATE ON THE USA DVDs  According to the box the first film of the trilogy is fullscreen and the other 2 in widescreen. But according to DVD TALK ""the previous DVD release of the first film in the trilogy from Anchor Bay presented the movie in 1.66.1 anamorphic widescreen which is supposedly the film's original aspect ratio. This release from Magnolia picture presents the first film in the same aspect ratio (the packaging says fullframe - it's not) but the picture is not 16x9 enhanced.""

The Anchor Bay DVD of the first film however DOES say on the box it's enhanced so it could be preferable to the first film in this newer box set.

In the UK box, the first film is in widescreen and the other 2 are 4:3  I don't know if the first film is also anamorphically enhanced in the UK.  I'll have to figure that out.

The Anchor Bay release of the 1st film not only is anamorphically enhanced but supposedly also has commentary and a 5.1 surround mix that aren't present on the Magnolia box set. Looks like you need both for the full package. So in this case, if you get both, no need for the UK box set at all.",1351728000,5,1300,4.273469387755102
2565400,5,B000FH8TZ6,"If you like 'Taxi Driver' then you'll be delighted by the Pusher Trilogy a very realistic story about the sad lives of hoodlums and crooks in Denmark in the 1990's. What - you don't automatically think of Denmark and crime? Well, sit back and enjoy this wonderful trilogy of films by Nicholas Windig Refn.
Kim Bodnia plays the protagonist of the first film, a small time criminal who struggles with his girlfriend's pregnancy and his distrust of his criminal cohorts - an amazing Mads Mikkelsen as Tony.
In Film two - Tony (Mads Mikkelsen) is back as the lost, cruel, heart breaking Tony, who upon being released from prison is desperate for respect but is trapped by those around him - the penultimate scenes of him covered in tattoos demanding RESPECT but getting only mockery and abuse - as he tries to escape from his past on a midnight bus is shockingly moving.
Zlatko Buric is a low level crime lord who struggles with his addiction (clean for 16 hours)and attempts to deal with his daughters imminent wedding while trying to maintain some small control over the criminals around him in Film three.

8122543,4,B000FH8TZ6,"Visceral and gut-wrenching the Pusher trilogy is a throwback to early Martin Scorsese's gangster films. It is brutal, non-stop and fascinating to watch.
Kim Bodnia does a fantastic job as Frank in the original but it is truly Mads Mikkelsen who shines as Tonny, a low level drug-dealer and criminal, in the streets of Copenhagen in Pusher 2. Either way, all three films are excellent and they are shot from 3 character's different points of views which makes for compelling story-telling. If you like Mean Streets - the Pusher trilogy is right for you.",1491264000,,552,4.882978723404255
8122544,5,B000FH8TZ6,Here is a European seedy underworld. Full of that cramped moistness you get when you visit a friend's joint that reeks of mildew and peeling paint. The best part is the dialects. They are difficult to understand if one is not from a culture clashed with emigrant from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Dont bother trying to share it with anyone. Just keep it and feel washed in the madness. Its like having your own personal Dante Inferno.,1475452800,,441,4.594936708860759

8122549,2,B000FH8TZ6,"Like I said, I expected something totally different.
Something extreme, something truely violent, sexual, speedy, brutal, and so on, not a Martin Scorsese early film kind of stuff.
It turns out to be like a real documentary style live raw film.
I won't say they were bad. They were just not my taste.
I probably won't see them and put them in one corner for a long time since I saw them all 3.",1446768000,,393,4.324324324324325
