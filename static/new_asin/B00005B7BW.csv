7937105,3,B00005B7BW,"BRENTWOOD 10 Movie Packs offer a variety of cinematic genres at bargain prices. Video transfers of their ""B"" movies are pretty decent, as is sound. The manufacturer's hinged boxes house DVDs adequately, but be careful the hinged sections don't pull away from the main spine! They're not that easy to reassemble.

HIGHLIGHTS of the WOMEN WHO KICK BUTT 10 Movie Pack:

The pickin's here are slim for all save fans of female martial arts films...

THE FIRING LINE-- A whiny bleach-blonde helicoptor pilot takes to the ground to fight a guerilla war in the Philippino jungles.

FLIGHT TO DANGER-- Stars its lady co-directors in a story of a martial arts team transporting a mysterious box they received in Paris that's sought by gangster types.

GET CHRISTIE LOVE!-- Blaxploitation comes to television. Example of a short-lived TV series about an African-American female undercover cop, her white dyspeptic boss and the cases she gets involved in.

SISTER STREET FIGHTER-- The best title in the set is this vintage Japanese martial arts film that teams Sonny Chiba with Etsuko Shihomi. Never mind the plot... enjoy the action!

T.N.T. JACKSON-- Scripted by longtime Roger Coman acting favorite Dick Miller (he was ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" customer who ate flowers), and featuring former Playboy Playmate Jeannie Bell as a karate expert who searches Hong Kong for her brother's killer.

If martial arts action is your thing, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TEN-FACES-OF-SONNY-CHIBA/dp/B000068TOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TEN FACES OF SONNY CHIBA</a>&nbsp;(also from BRENTWOOD) is just what you're looking for!

7937106,3,B00005B7BW,"When I saw this DVD boxed set, I got the sneaking suspicion that a production company was simply trying to unload some excess inventory. But I decided to get it, because I love female action heroes, and it was a pretty good deal- ten movies for under twenty bucks. Well the results, as it turned out, were somewhat uneven. There are some good ones (Sister Street Fighter in particular is loaded with great action scenes) and some that were simply awful (Street Angels had very little action and must have had a budget of about ten bucks), while others had their own merits (TNT Jackson is simply hilarious, a blaxploitation kung fu movie in which the fighters don't even come close to hitting each other!). All in all, the movies have their moments, but if you're into badass action movies with female leads, then I suggest going the Hong Kong ""bullets and breasts"" route, or maybe tracking down some Russ Meyer movies.",1020297600,16,919,4.679012345679013
