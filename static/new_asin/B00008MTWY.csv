1852836,5,B00008MTWY,This is perhaps the greatest movie I've ever seen. It's even better than WILD STYLE.,1056844800,2,84,4.666666666666667
1852837,5,B00008MTWY,"Although I was three yrs old when the film was released, Style Wars captures an amazing moment in NYC when hip-hop/breakdancing/graffiti was at the cusp of a new movement. During my childhood growing up in Harlem, I used to love taking the subways (circa 86-89) around the city and partly one of the reasons I appreciate this film is the fact that it represents graffiti art and the culture surrounding it in an unique way. Style Wars brought back a plethora of childhood memories! Damn, I miss it. The two directors have done a superb job in giving a 'voice' to the people who experienced the lifestyle during a turbulent time in the ghettos of NYC: The Writers and B-boys. I, in my personal opinion, think that graffiti art is seen as an apparatuse (sp) of postmodernism in the way we live in a complicated and confusing society. Purchase this film for fans and lovers of hip-hop culture and its origin, graffiti art as a subculture, the beauty and essence of NYC urban life during the late 70's and early 80's and, equally significant, how these 'writers' detailed their story.",1053388800,7,1080,4.689473684210526
1852838,5,B00008MTWY,"This is probably the most important documentary of my generation. I can relate to this, I'm not from NYC and I'm too young to have been involved with ""writing"" back in 83. Grafitti was the begining block of the Hip-Hop culture. Tony did a spectacular job capturing the essence of being a B-Boy in the eairly 80's in NYC. I feel the documentary holds more weight because of who made it.  Tony wasn't involved with the culture, he made a film, not even understanding the culture. And with no idea that it would become the biggest money maker the world over, all in less then 20 years after this was shot.  It's really an amazing work of art.  Grafitti never got the respect it deserved, not just from the genral public. Who you'd expect to not understand, and therefor hate.  But, outside of the true heads, graf wasn't a big deal.  I love the drama in this movie.  You have the writers, who the people of NYC, including the Mayor hate.  Tony doesn't paint them as villians, or as heros. He just tells their story, or rather allows them to tell their own story. But even with them being villians, you have Cap, a bomber who tags over the writers peices.  In a sense he is a villian even to the villans.  Some of the interviews with the kids are really outstanding.  You can learn a lot from a 13 year old.  Even better on the second DVD you have interviews 20 years later with some of the ""kids"" from the movies.  It was something to see that a lot of them have taken their talent, aned turned it into legal business, and are getting rich off it.  I love art, and I find good grafitti, illegal or not, to be beautiful.  This is a timeless peice, and it sheds a lot of light on a culture that so many kids today love, but so few actually know about, especially the roots.  And ""Style Wars"" is as close to the roots as you can get.
Tony Silver & Henry Chalfant set out 20+ years ago to make a different documentary.  As they say in their interviews now, they had no vision back then that this would possibly be one of the most important movies. About a culture, that would turn out to not be a fad, but be as real as anything else.
This Documentary should be required viewing for everybody. It tells the story of many people who never got the chance to speak.",1052870400,5,2255,4.270588235294118
1852839,5,B00008MTWY,"I pride myself on being knowledgable about hip hop.  I am officially embarrased by having NOT seen this great work of art when it was first released.  It's informative, concise, clear, and doesn't hold back.  You want to know the where/how/when/why of graf and what it meant to those who LIVED it, then get Style Wars.

1852841,5,B00008MTWY,"I, like many, first saw Style Wars back in the early 80's on PBS as an impressionable youth who was just discovering Hip Hop in all it's forms. It has remained to this day, one of the best (certainly the most honest) accounts of Hip Hop in it's relative infancy. While the focus is squarely on the ""writers"" (graffiti artists for all you new jacks), we do get to see other aspects of Hip Hop culture in play (most notably b-boying with the Rock Steady Crew). Watching the film on dvd after so many years was literally like going back in time. It not only holds up, it has aged like fine wine. Every shot in the film reeks of NY & Hip Hop in the early 80's. A true, 100% bonafide classic in every sense of the word. The filmakers have succeeded beautifully in capturing the spirit of the time, the place, the people and the culture. This is a true time capsule if there ever was one.
Ok, enough with accolades. Now on to the disc. Dang. Talk about getting the deluxe treatment. Whereas the Wild Style DVD is incomplete (see my review), Style Wars is not only complete, uncut and un-altered, it is absolutely full to brim with fantastic extras...close to 4 HOURS worth. Highlights include art and interviews with many of the films participants. Most notable for me was MIN ONE. He's the tough little curly-haired, white kid who tries to get the rest of the writers to retaliate against Cap for ""going over their burners"". (""That's never forgive action""). All I can say is he looks like he's been through one hell of a lot in the last 20 years. Very sobering to say the least.
Other extras include outtakes, audio commentary by the filmakers, and (this is very cool) a 30 minute loop of ""whole cars"".
If you consider yourself a serious Hip Hop head, you have no excuse not to own this dvd.",1050969600,57,1786,4.415151515151515

1852903,5,B00008MTWY,"FINALLY!!!! If, like me, you were waiting for the restoration of this classic hip-hop documentary to be completed... the moment has arrived. Considered by many to be the first hip-hop documentary, and definitely the best even today, the 16mm negatives had decomposed. A furious campaign was launched to drum up money so that the movie could be restored and transferred to 1920x1080 resolution. This campaign spanned the Style Wars website, Auction Cause, Kickstarter, and event parties. Like many other small-time donors who pitched in $50 I was included in the restored movie's credits. I have now become one of the few people that can say their name appears in the same movie credits as Brad Pitt and Kenau Reeves ;-). Yep, they and a handful of other celebrities were donors too. Graffiti crews and artists, even the mysterious ""The X-One"" are listed in the credits too! Very cool.

I know it sounds funny, but the blu-ray MENU is even cool, and it's the first thing you see. It's comprised of various first-person view shots of the subway moving along the platforms. The footage is grainy and ""real"" I guess you could say, and shows sights of New York City back in the 80's that gets you right in the mood for the rest of the film.

The big attraction is seeing all those old moving subway trains with graffiti on them. It's there. I could kinda end this review right there, but there is a lot more on this blu-ray for the die hard hip-hop fanatic.

The outtakes: This is the highlight of the disc for me. It's basically a second version of Style Wars with never before seen footage. Notable stars like Futura 2000, Fab Five Freddy and Keith Haring make appearances. They never made it to the final cut, and the reasons why are explored in depth with another added feature: Style Wars on the Cutting Room Floor. Basically it was a movie made while Style Wars was filmed, and it documents the internal debates amongst the filmmakers regarding what would eventually be included in the movie. One interesting tidbit is that Tony Silver remarks about how they thought they were documenting a movement that was in its last days, only to find out mid-film that they were on the ground floor of the beginning!

One interesting part of the outtakes is that a city worker admonishes the film makers for showcasing graffiti, as it will inevitably spread what she saw as a damaged culture. Maybe her assessment of the culture was incorrect but her take on the film's effect was not!
The other extras are ""B-Boy Showcase"" which is a lot of footage from the Rock Steady vs. Dynamic Rockers breakdance contest, and a version of the film with Tony Silver and Henry Chalfant's commentary.

Admittedly, there are a couple of rough spots in this release,  It was shot in 16mm, meant for television, and so some of the grain shows in the higher resolution version, which you would not see on the old televisions.  I don't have a 5.1 surround system so I can't vouch for the audio on this release either.

All-in-all, if you have the cassette version and DVD of Style Wars already, you will still want to get this too. If you are new to the movie, this is the best version to start with.",1416787200,5,3171,4.629893238434164
1852904,5,B00008MTWY,"A documentary originally intended for PBS in 1983, Style Wars went on to introduce mainstream America to the growing NYC youth culture that would eventually become known as Hip Hop. Before Rap music was a primary component of pop culture, there were b-boys in New York City thriving on ""bombing"" subway trains with artistic designs and staging breakdancing contests.

Primarily focusing on graffiti artists and the first glimpses of breakdancing, director Tony Silver's inviting documentary is a lovingly crafted ode to what had been a widely misunderstood subculture at the time. It made a legend of its participants, making names like Crazy Legs and Seen recognizable to this day in the Hip-Hop community. Style Wars is a vital portrait of that place and time, capturing the original spirit of hip hop better than any other film. It is an essential document of that community's original ethos.

Graffiti artists had invented an entirely new form of art with cheap spray paint and their canvas, NYC's vast network of subway trains. Children born this century will hardly recognize the world of New York City seen in Style Wars. The year is 1982, and the great metropolis had yet to be sanitized from the dirt and grime it had picked up in the 1970s. Wildly inventive graffiti covers its moving trains, all over the five Burroughs. Director Tony Silver brilliantly avoids almost any narration, instead employing fairly honest street interviews with teenagers the culture thrived on in NYC. Providing an opposing viewpoint, former mayor Ed Koch and a police officer comment about the pernicious effects of graffiti, which they claim is malicious vandalism that costs the government serious money.

Style Wars is a raw, sympathetic look at the culture, passing little judgment on its actions for both good and ill. Style Wars is fondly remembered because it celebrated the artistic creativity of the graffiti artists and showcased them in their natural habitat. Everything that is shown feels entirely authentic, informing viewers of the extensive planning involved with the visually dynamic murals. There is a frenetic exuberance when the Rock Steady Crew, led by Crazy Legs, battles a rival crew of breakdancers using acrobatic moves that had never been seen on national television before Style Wars.

Having not seen Style Wars in many years, I was worried the documentary might not hold up to the fond nostalgia it held in my memory. That could not be farther from the truth, Style Wars remains a captivating look into New York City's street culture of the time. Told directly from the perspective of actual graffiti artists, or ""bombers"" as they preferred, it provided a window into the nascent community of Hip hop that few other sources have matched. Director Tony Silver and producer Henry Chalfant ended up making a lively documentary that made its mark in hip hop history, still fondly remembered today by fans. Style Wars is both informative and entertaining, a rare feat in documentary filmmaking.

1852911,5,B00008MTWY,"As a pre-teen youngster growing up in a rural community outside of Pittsburgh, PA, how I got into hip-hop music in the 80's is anybody's guess.  With so little access to any type of urban culture, I scoured every TV channel, magazine and record store for the smallest glimpse of what the kids in the city were doing, and what the rappers, DJs, and breakdancers I idolized were like.  No doubt, there must be others out there like me who were born in another place or time, but feel a connection to the ultimate youth culture of creativity that is hip-hop.  It is from this perspective that my review is written.

Style Wars immerses the viewer in the lives of real New York City characters, who's stories actually took place.  Creative, energetic, rebellious kids looking for an outlet for their ideas, and a way to belong to something, they turned the New York City subway into their battleground and art gallery.  The look, the sound, the feel of the environment... all perfectly documented.  You feel as though you're in the yard circa 1981, breathing paint fumes and lookin' over your shoulder for the cops, or at the writer's bench, talkin' up your next big ""burner"".

If you're an avid fan of the hip-hop culture, and want to vicariously live (or re-live) the life of a New York City teen in the early 80's for an hour, this film is for you.  The DVD extras are dope as well!",1292630400,4,1381,4.536290322580645

Simply because it was shot at the right time, at the right place, by the right people and thus formed the main source on a world wide level up till this day for any hip hop enthousiast, wheter you're a b-boy, graffer, rapper, fashion designer, dj, whatever.
It captured hip hop culture and life style in the most entertaining way, performed by a great cast of names who became legends. The discussion on who shouldn't and wouldn't've been in the movie totally miisses the point.

You get a cast that was hardcore involved in the movement at that certain time. And it turned out time less.

An absolute must see, for every single soul likes to learn, witness passion, dedication, overall creativity right at the base hip hop culture!

1852930,4,B00008MTWY,"From the Amazon review: ""Some call it tagging, others called it writing, still others call it ""bombing"" yo--but it's all graffiti.
Whether it's art or not is another matter (some of it is), but it's undeniably illegal (that's why I like it especially).
Tony Silver and Henry Chalfant's world historic Public BS documentary STYLE WARS tracks the rise and fall of subway graffiti in New York City in the late 1970s and early 1980s before hip hop culture's decline.
At the peak of its popularity, graffiti was as much a part of B-boy culture as rapping, smoking marijuana, Nike basketball shoes, gangbangin', scratching, and breaking.
The filmmakers present a sympathetic, but well-rounded portrait of their subject through extensive interviews with taggers(graffiti artistes)--most notably Seen, Kase, and Dondi--art collectors, transit authorities, and even Mayor Ed Koch, who would eventually put ""the hammer down"" hard.
Many would be persecuted and prosecuted by the State and sent to work camps, prisons and group therapy sessions.
Along the way, they documented the burgeoning breakdance scene (the greatest form of dancing ever invented), with a focus on the world-famous Rock Steady Crew.
The soundtrack features selections from Grandmaster Flash, the Treacherous Three, and other *tagger-approved* icons of the old-school.

1852931,3,B00008MTWY,"Style Wars (1983) from directors Henry Chalfant and Tony Silver,
is a grass roots, street-level documentary that is easily
digested, as it's pleasing to the eyes.

It offers a glimpse of 10 to 16 year olds, in the inner cities of
Brooklyn, Bronx back in the 1970's and 1980's, who are surrounded
by high rises,  who brainstormed for ideas back in the 1970's to
have fun and pass the time.

In this particular instance, it involves dance competitions, art
competitions, music competitions, expressed in various
recreational halls through the break-dance styles, DJ-ing and
rapping, free-styling with rhymes as well as by using up 15 to 20
canisters per subway train in color painting them.

This subculture, comprising the ""personal lives"" of dozens of
youths (in contrast to school, or professional endeavors) is
specialized to the point that various youths' aliases become
""stars"" in their own right, with verbal histories or accounts
being told and passed down to other joining this movement, who
are pigeon holed in this ghetto.

The psych of those taking part, is underpinned by a sense of peer
pressure in the group for the best art, dance moves and ability
to rhyme, coupled with a sense of ego gratification by somehow
having become world-class, as their assigned names or tags are
seen on trains crossing the city. Perhaps a sensitive point for
the undertrodden in the inner cities, housing projects,
accustomed to poverty, yet crossing all background and cultural
lines.

The images taken are numerous, well chosen, and the narrative
well planned, the testimonies frequent, the educational aspects
to the masses very understandable. Underground terminology such
as ""bombing"" (meaning to deface a train for the first time),
breaking and rocking (meaning, doing a style of dance), are a few
explained.

Some locations are reminiscent of those seen in Escape from the
Bronx, by Enzo Castellari or Warriors by Walter Hill, such as the
manhole entrance, or the underground warehouse, etc.

Inevitably the idea is taken from the ephemeral, to amateur, to
professional, as viewers see graffitists sketching ideas back
home, planning out missions on trains, organizing themselves in
time and space, approprating 15 paint cans at a time, from
stores, in their competition. To the point that 8 year olds are
given an apprenticeship of sorts into become accomplished
graffittists.

All sides of the story are told, with messages from the mayor of
the city, police detectives, concerned parents, outraged public
transit users, keeping in mind that these deeds against property
pale in comparison to behaviors against people also processed in
the justice system (murders. etc)  or even, the 3-card-Monte,
pickpockets, shoplifts, etc.

The movie redeems itself, by calling attention to art galleries,
school programs for those with a talent in visual art, by
suggesting that the ""big time"" is possible into the mass media.
It also underlines sensitivity campaigns against graffiti, by
boxers Hector Camacho and Alex Ramos.",1239321600,4,3017,5.238589211618257
1852932,5,B00008MTWY,"This is a true PBS classic. I grew up primarily in a rural Ohio setting, and when my art teacher showed this documentary to our high school class in '83 or '84 it opened up a whole new world to us. I'd been listening to rap radio broadcasting out of Cleveland, but I had absolutely no context for understanding what I was listening to until I saw this film.

As an art geek, I found the graffiti itself arresting and inspiring, and it became one more strong influence on the artwork I was doing in those formative years. I immediately became a vandal.

For every person who, even to this day when hip hop culture is everywhere, scratches his or her head at it, this film is a must see. You'll learn about the formative years of hip hop as a popular movement, New York City politics (Ed Koch appears several times, displaying his trademark big stick approach), and urban youth culture. You'll see undirected artistic talent developing organically in the sunlight of peer approval, the universality of competition (at least among males; females are nowhere to be found in the film, except as mothers), and the unwavering importance of personal expression in every socioeconomic setting.

Fantastic, and worth owning.",1234396800,2,1214,4.771428571428571

From the very beginning, with the dark shots of the trains rolling through the yards, it's apparent that is a very well filmed piece. The mood of the early 80s is nicely portrayed with the imagery and soundtrack.

What's really great about Style Wars, is that althought it's meant to show graffiti culture to outsiders, it doesn't have the feel of a mundane ""outside looking in"" type documentary. The makers definitely knew not to treat graffiti as some type of fleeting trend or mildly interesting phenomenon. They saw the depth of it and portrayed it well.

Coming from NYC, graffiti has been a part of my life for a long time. I can honestly say that this is a very good film to watch to learn it's history. It will have you thinking more about the graff you see on a day to day basis.

I would say that there could have been more action shots of actual painting being done. I mean, the artists featured in the film bombed hardcore, they wouldn't opposed to be being filmed in action. Either way, the picture montages and rolling train shots suffice.",1228867200,2,1139,4.514563106796117

1852937,5,B00008MTWY,"Style Wars documents the early graffiti scene in NYC and places it in the context of hip hop culture and the city at large. The film does a great job of conveying the passion graffiti writers have for their art, but is less successful at bringing into focus the conflicts between writers, parents, and city government. (The writers are never asked directly, for example, why they think it's acceptable to damage public property in pursuit of their art.) Nor is the connection between writers and b-boys and rappers drawn explicitly, despite the considerable time spent showing dancing. Nevertheless, there is a lot of good material here and, despite the filmmakers' obvious bias, all sides in this conflict are treated respectfully. The presentation itself is also quite artful, particularly the opening.

In addition to an extensive gallery, the bonus disc updates the story of 1983's Style Wars with interviews circa 2002. Not only do we get the artists' thoughts about the technique and history of graff and its relationship to music and dance, we get to hear what it meant to them then and now and how it changed their lives.",1185926400,,1129,4.942105263157894
1852938,4,B00008MTWY,"Art historians comb through years of research to find landmark events or works of art that launched a new era or genre. This documentary is that catalytic event for graffiti at the global level, and hip hop culture in general. The ripple effect that this documentary had across the world was amazing. If you were a kid in 1984, and your parents took you to the museum to see the World Graffiti Tour (I still have the poster) you went out the next day and spray painted your name on something.

After re-watching this in 2007, I noted something that I missed in 1984. The writers are plagued by CAP, the nutball renegade who is bent on crossing out all pieces with his toy throw-ups, yet they refuse to band together and resolve the problem. It struck me that although CAP's actions are antagonistic to the community of graffiti writer's, his principals are the same. He is putting his name up where it will get the most attention. On some subconscious level the larger graffiti community recognizes this and sees that by persecuting CAP, their hypocritical actions would place them in the same category as those that criticize and decry the merits of Graffiti as an art form. As an adult looking back at that time period, I was impressed by this unwillingness to turn against one who is basically on the same side, especially given the general opinion that New Yorkers had at the time of Graffiti writers being a destructive and violent group. I bet those New Yorkers are now longing for the days when kids carried spray paint in their back packs instead of AK-47s in the back seat of their Escalade. Personally, I would prefer it if the kids got the money for the Escalade from painting murals rather than slinging llello, but whatever. Right?

1852955,5,B00008MTWY,"The very fact that in the special features section there is an entire segment of photos of the cars that have been tagged with graffiti and the fact that the individuals who tagged the trains are presented, interviewed and paid homage to tells what a phenomenal slice of history this documentary is.

It was filmed during the time that these artists were doing their work and the ones still living are followed up with many years later.  It really dives into the history and development of the phenomenon.  Who can forget images of dirty big cities with the trains riding along with huge works of graffiti art on them?  Someone was there to document it all.  This film is a result of that work.

This is the story of it all.  Interesting is the documenting of the lengths the authorities had to go to in order to control the ""problem"" (which, of course, is a matter of perspective).  One of the artist is shown years later with his mother gleaming with pride and his mother, interviewed earlier in the film as well, still rolls her eyes at his pride.

The artists are interviewed, both then and now, and the connection of graffiti to hip-hop and B-boy culture is touched upon, although this is probably the weakest link in the film.  Wild Style and The Freshest Kids take you deeper into the world of B-boys and Scratch takes you deeper into the world of hip-hop and the emergence of rap from it.

The world was exposed to true urban art, and it's unlikely Picasso's- the bombers and taggers of NYC's resilient subway system. Not only that, but also to 'acrobatic body dances like breaking', and to rocking the mic. This is so much more than just a documentary about the evolution of graffiti. It is truly a time capsule, full of unforgettable characters, stuffy bureaucrats, and the chaotic urban landscape of early 80's NYC. There are so many memorable lines and incredible characters indelibly etched in my brain from this film.

1852996,5,B00008MTWY,"It's as if Style Wars co-star (and graffiti pioneer) Iz The Wiz was predicting the outcome of this classic documentary when he emphatically yelled:""This is it...this is it!"" in one of it's scenes.  Some 20 years later, the world over is echoing Iz's exact same sentiments.  With Style Wars, creators Henry Chalfant and Tony Silver assembled one of the best and historiaclly correct Hip Hop documentaries to date.  Taking place around '81, '82 during the Koch administration, Style Wars delves mostly into NY's subway graffiti and B-boy culture. By far, two of the more illustrious facets in the cultural jewel known as Hip Hop.  Style Wars captures graffiti and B-boy pioneers (most in their teens) doin' what they do best and ultimately shaping the course of Hip Hop culture.  All the ""true-school"" legends are here (i.e., The Rocksteady Crew, Dondi, Seen, Dez a.k.a. DJ Kay Slay, etc.) equipped with a vintage NY backdrop and killa soundtrack.  As ""fresh"" as it was back in '84 when PBS ""broke"" it, Style Wars works because it not only deals with the creative forces behind it's subject matter, but those effected by it as well.  From the linoleum kitchen of famed graffiti artist Skeme to the B-boy battlegrounds of the U.S.A.  skating rink, Style Wars is there.  With unforgettable scenes like dopey Mayor Ed Koch screwing-up at a press conference to graffiti legend Duro mispronouncing the word ""negotiate"", Style Wars captures it all.  Celebrating it's 20th anniversary, Style Wars' recent double DVD release only adds to it's greatness.  Packed with 4 hours of nothing but flavor, this double delight doesn't dissappoint.  It would've been great to have seen graffiti great Kase 2 (or Noc) make the DVD, but the revisiting of Skeme and Mom Barbara (minus the kitchen) definitely makes up for it.  So, if you're thinking of spending your hard earned on anything boasting unadulterated Hip Hop, Style Wars is a sure-shot.

Style Wars is an inside look into the roots of hip-hop culture and its effects on society. The documentary, which originally appeared on PBS, explores the rise of graffiti writing on the New York City subway lines, as well as a quick look at break-dancing and rapping in the early 1980s. Through interviews with some of the major graffiti artists of the time we learn about the development of different artistic techniques of tagging up and what the motivation was for so many inner-city kids to get into such a dangerous and illegal hobby (most say it was for the fame of having people see their name). Although many in New York at the time saw graffiti as a nuisance, the writers ultimately had the last laugh as many of them were accepted into the Downtown art world and parlayed graffiti writing into a successful art career. The original film is short at just sixty-nine minutes so this DVD thankfully offers up a host of bonuses such as the thirty-four minute Style Wars: Revisited which catches up with some of the writers twenty years later to see what they had been up to  surprisingly many of them are still passionate about graffiti and some of them are even still writing! Other bonuses include four new interviews with writers from the film, a somewhat incongruous Aesop Rock video, and a thirty minute loop of old graffiti masterpieces called Destroy All Lines. All in all, Style Wars is a truly essential piece for fans of graffiti, old hip-hop or inner-city culture.",1450396800,,1520,4.775665399239544
