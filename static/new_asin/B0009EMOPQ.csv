2284038,5,B0009EMOPQ,"As I have written in other reviews for this production of Der Ring des Nibelungen in both its CD/audio-only and DVD formats, I must here say again that I am truly captivated and ultimately quite bowled over by this production of Der Ring des Nibelungen, making me believe that this must be one of the greatest musical monuments in existence (as created by Wagner and as performed by Barenboim et al).
This production of Die Walkure has really won me over to thinking this opera maybe the most intensely emotional of all of the operas in the Ring. This has to do - beside the intense drama of the story - with the very good and often exceptionally beautiful singing. Certainly, there is not one weak link in the whole cast, but then I must admit I am quite biased towards this Ring, singing-wise, as well as concerning stage-design and especially the music as conducted by maestro Barenboim. Daniel Barenboim hits it just right every time to my feeling, broodingly dark or glowingly extatic or bitingly agressive or soaringly melodic when needed, but to my feeling always completely in touch with the finer points of the drama that is playing out on stage.
Some people have expressed a dislike for some of the slow tempi of maestro Barenboim, or the way that he sometimes does not take the singers into account enough, drowning them out. I have never really understood this, especially when the playing is as transparent and as clearly articulated as it is here. Whenever maestro Barenboim slows down, he always retains the necessary intensity, never surrendering to playing just for beauty's sake, ever retaining a crystal clear clarity of dramatic vision, all instrumental voices and 'registers' singing out expressively and purposely the whole time. I believe his singers are indeed all quite able to stay abreast of the sometimes thundering waves of orchestral sound.
The same intensity of dramatic purpose which is expressed through the conducting is expressed in the singing and acting. Certainly, most singers combine wonderfully musical voices with fine dramatic skills. First, Poul Elming is (voice) acting out a convincing Siegmund, even if his singing cannot erase memories of the likes of for example Jon Vickers and Siegfried Jerusalem (but thankfully, the last will later join the cast of this production as one of the most powerful and characterful Siegfrieds ever recorded, IMHO). And even when Nadine Secunde's Sieglinde is not as fresh as one would like maybe, she does indeed express - in singing and acting - enough of the ardour and pain of repressed love under (and during Act II, fear for revenge by) her oppressive husband Hunding, quite effectively sung by a menacingly aggressive Matthias Holle.
Where the first act is beautifully sung and played - utterly captivating from one moment to the other, but with a great sense of dramatic momentum and tension -, things get even better in the second act, I believe. Enter John Tomlinson, Anne Evans and Linda Finnie! Their singing and acting 'ups the ante' even more, all three of them bringing an almost ideal combination of dramatic intensity and virtuosity and beauty of singing (on a practically bare stage; how beautifully evocative!). John Tomlinson must be one of the most deeply resounding and emotively expressive Wotans ever, and I truly adore him. Certainly the camera loves him ;-) Anne Evans not only sounds beautiful and refined, but her singing is also deeply sympathetic and emotionally engaged, with the necessary touch of vulnerability - her Brunnhilde is something quite different from, for example, Birgit Nilsson's. Her singing together with Poul Elming (in 'threesome' with the wonderful orchestra) in the 'death announcement' in Act II, scene 4 ('Siegmund! sieh auf mich!') is utterly compelling as well, with some of the most gorgeous singing by Anne Evans. Linda Finnie's Fricka is powerful, with a nicely steely edge to her timbre, and appropriately aggressive.
But it is during the 'time alone between father and daughter' that this Die Walkure is maybe at its best, although I must again say I never ever  really experience one dull moment in this whole performance at all. Nevertheless, there are many high points which do stand out, and I think the whole of Scene 2 of Act II is one of those high points of this opera/performance, the intensity often causing shivers down the spine of this particular listener. If Wotan is ultimately forced to punish his dearest daughter during the last act, it was already brought home to us during all of the foregoing that it could indeed have been no other way, but only through the long battle of wits (with Fricka) and inner conflict (Love against Law) that preceeded it, especially in the previous Act II, scenes 1 and 2. One cannot truly understand the beginnings without knowing the end ;-)
One could go on and on about the many beauties of this performance and this whole 'Ring' in general, but I would now just like to end my ravings and say: please try and see this intensely dramatic Die Walkure for yourself and find out for yourself if you like (or indeed love) it. Those who already love the audio-only version of these operas need not hesitate, as the visual aspect greatly enhances the complete experience of this magnificent 'Gesamtkunstwerk' (at least, it does so for me)...
Highly recommended.",1160179200,14,5348,4.942222222222222
2284039,2,B0009EMOPQ,"The conducting is good and the singing overall is ok, but the stage direction is just too ridiculous for me.  The characters are moving around constantly in a ""high energy"" state, even when the music is most calm and tender (see for example Wotan arming Bruennhilde with helmet and shield after she goes to sleep).  They look constantly caffinated, and this nervous energy should not be mistaken for ""intensity.""

Kupfer seems to have totally misheard a lot of the music, and the actions of the characters not only don't correspond with the music, they actually go against it.  When the music is the most climactic in the farewell scene, B. and Wotan fall straight down on their faces on the stage, arms outstretched.  It could not be more absurd.  Is he actually trying to make fun of the music?

That being said I love the way the stage looks, with the long road going into nowhere.  In my opinion the ""Walkyrie Ramp"" is tacky and somehow they, with the most energetic music, are the least energetic characters.  Also tacky is the red laser-box Loge.  Couldn't it at least move around?",1152835200,10,1087,4.673684210526316
2284040,5,B0009EMOPQ,"Wagnerians were probably awaiting anxiously, since many years, the DVD release of this famous Unitel NHK recording of the Kupfer's Ring, at the 1992 Bayreuth Festpielhaus, also known as the Barenboim's Ring. We should be thankful to MSM Studios GmbH, in Munchen, for this very meticulous remastering of the original analog tapes (1250 lines) to bring them into the modern digital High Definition format (1080 lines.). And now Warner Classics brings us the work of this restoration effort on DVD (480 lines). Wow!!!

According to Le Guide des Opras de Wagner (Fayard), you can expect a kind of post Tchernobylian Ring carrying us, through a science fiction landscape, in the world of the falling Gods. Harry Kupfer's creative directing, combined with the uncluttered but convincing stage design of Hans Schavernoch and the uncontested cinematographer talent of the video director Horant H. Hohlfeld, really puts us there! But let's not forget the Barenboim's way of lifting the whole orchestra to an unprecedented dramatic climax in certain crucial moments. But what kind of experience can be improvised to put in perspective the Barenboim & Kupfer's partnership? A good friend joined me to make a walk trough in 4 different versions of the same act and the same scenes.

We began with So nimst du von Siegmund den Sieg? (Act 2, Scene 2, 28), where Wotan loses temper and declares the end of the History (leading finally to the Gtterdmmerung) by provoking a cataclysmic event, only possible with such a large stage as Bayreuth, while the orchestra sustains us creatively to live one of the most dramatic climax of the entire cycle of the Ring. In an almost surrealistic anger moment, Wotan (interpreted brilliantly by John Tomlinson) carries his singing to an unprecedented and dramatic breathless state, as anyone usually goes after talking very loud for a while in a conflict situation. It almost brings the spectator into a state of fear, quite exceptionally! We ended with Siegmund! Sieh auf mich (Act 3, Scene 4, 34), where Brnnhilde appears to Siegmund and Sieglind. We were impressed by the way that Siegmund acknowledges the beauty of Brnnhilde. This first encounter is played in a way that conducts the spectator to wonder if a divine creature first appears in the mind, without the need to be seen. We were amazed by this very dramatic staging, sustained by an unequaled and subtle orchestral work...

After taking our breath also, we decided to dive into the Bayreuth Boulez Chrau's version, to experience the same sequence. We were trying to remind how Wotan would go through this dramatic event... We were very far of how Kupfer Barenboim's combined talents underline such an important declaration as the end of the God's era, even if the context of the story telling is the same. Almost deceiving compared to the cataclysmic event of our first viewing. The interactions between the singers are by no means also the same.

For the third run, we chose to return to Kupfer that time, to enjoy again another end of the Gods, with the Liceu's De Billy Kupfer Version. What would happen at this crucial moment? We recognized immediately the Kupfer's direction of the singers, keeping the same intensity and drama that in his previous one. We were pleased again by an updated Schavernoch set, also reflecting the same uncluttered spirit allowing the spectator to focus on the precarious mind of Wotan, at that ultimate moment. The singers are without any doubt more glued to their dramatic situation, the interactions between them bring us almost to the level of the first reenactment of this dramatic moment we saw an hour before. We anxiously wait for the climax and then, in an incredible moment, a spectacular event, in the same order of magnitude than in our first viewing, happens in a dramatic and unexpected way. And the symbol used in this action is very clever too. We are sustained again by a music which, in contrast to Barenboim, clearly puts in the foreground the wind instruments, in a less dramatic approach.

So far, so good, enough information to vote for Barenboim Kupfer as being the most compelling, dramatic and mind bending version? A story leading us to the end of the Gods must be told in a very dramatic way, but there was a final contender : the Staatsoper Stuttgart 2003 staging, which already gets some harsh criticism, despite the fact that the richness of the Ring opens the way to so many interpretations by an international community of different artists (stage directors, set designers or orchestra conductors). Well, we were trying to keep an open mind in this fourth segment viewing and found some interesting clues about the nature of the problems shared by the human and the gods. According to the liner notes, we have here a kind of a psychoanalytic reading of the Ring, but it would not be the Ring for beginners. And not the one to taste a really dramatic story line happening in a post modern or event post Tchernobylian world.

So, Kupfer Barenboim's Ring gets our personal award of the most mind binding Ring ever made and we truly share the challenge met by Kupfer and Barenboim in Bayreuth! This rebirth, from the archives of Unitel, tells us there is always a hope that the recording industry will always take care of the master's works. In a post Tchernobylian world, don't we need only to stay away from the radiations and witness the fall of the Gods, but we need to enclose ourselves in our cocoons and taste the music that put us away, sometimes, of a harsh planetary environment! And the Barenboim & Kupfer's Ring certainly does it pretty well!",1137801600,21,5603,4.880252100840337
2284041,5,B0009EMOPQ,"For sometime now, I've owned this 1993 production of Wagner's Die Walkure on Laser Disc.  This Bayreuth production has always been my favorite of the ones that are currently available visually.  Therefore, I'm thrilled that it is now on DVD.  In this presentation of Die Walkure the orchestra under Barenboim is excellent (as expected) and the singers are wonderful.

Of the singers I particularly like Tomlinson as Wotan and Finnie as Fricka,  Tomlinson sings with a rich, round and full bass/baritone voice imparting his role with sentimentality (expressed to Brnnhilde) fierce pride and fatherly concern expressed to Fricka and Brnnhilde.  He exhibits a spectacular voice and is very appealing physically really looking and sounding the part of the ""Head God"".!  Finnie, to me, is great as that old nag of nags Fricka.  She certainly shows Wotan who is boss.  (I do feel that after her aria no one could say ""no"" to her!)  She also displays a marvelous full rich voice-no shrieking!) Evans offers a small voiced but very feminine Brnnhilde.  The Siegmund and Sieglinde are sung and acted marvelously by Secunde and Holle-you really, for once, get the impression they just might be twins and most of all you DO get the impression  that they are in love.

This production is one I still call a modern production.  It uses laser-lights and a almost bare stage to great effect.  The sound quality and picture quality are superb-see the previous review for particulars regarding sound and picture; I agree completely with the reviewers analysis.",1136851200,21,1543,5.019685039370079
2284042,5,B0009EMOPQ,"To my taste the 1993 Barenboim/Bayreuth Ring is the best of the current
commercial video recordings of The Ring, which include as well: 1) the
1985 Bayreuth (Philips DVD), 2) the 1989 Bavarian State Opera
(EMI-Toshiba DVD), 3) the 1990 Metropolitan Opera (DG DVD), 4) the 2002
Stuttgart Staatsoper (TDK DVD), and 5) the 2004 Teatre del Liceu (Opus
Arte DVD). Most of the versions have significant strong points. The
1985 Bayreuth has very good singing and acting in a satisfying modern
production. For me, though, the sound and video quality have always
been disappointing. The 1989 production has very good audio and video
quality and a good, satisfying performance in a fairly interesting
production. However, this Japanese set is extremely expensive and hard
to buy. The 1990 Met performance is, amazingly, the only traditional
staging available. It is definitely a very good performance, but I find
the less traditional performances more stimulating. The audio and video
quality are only good. The 2002 Stuttgart performance is well sung and
the orchestra plays well. The sound is very good, video is OK. This
version has been roundly criticized, but mostly for its stage design.
It is pretty strange in parts (the Dragon in Siegfried, for example),
but I enjoyed many parts of it. The 2004 Barcelona performance has been
acclaimed by many reviewers, largely based on the stage design by Harry
Kupfer. The singing and orchestral playing are OK, the conductor's
tempo is generally slow. The sound recording is good, but the video
(particularly for a brand new release) is quite disappointingly grainy
to me.

Now we come to the 1993 Bayreuth/Barenboim production. Always important
for Wagner, the orchestral playing is excellent, Barenboim's conducting
is outstanding, and the recorded sound is excellent. The singing and
acting are uniformly very good. The stage design, again by Harry Kupfer
is modern (supposedly set in the 30's--Siegmund's costume is rather
Indiana Jones-like). The deep Bayreuth stage is effectively used.
Through all four operas I find the staging interesting and enjoyable to
look at, not so spare as to be boring but not so dominant as to be
awkward or overwhelming to the action. This performance has finally been released on DVD by Warner Classics in both the US and Europe in NTSC. I've learned from Warner that the original recording was in analog High Definition and their first step in preparing the curent DVD was to transfer the video recording to a digital 1080 line tape. There was also ambient sound recording in the original so the DTS sountrack is real 5.1. The 16:9 anamorphic picture is a big improvement over the laser disc, much more detail; the sound is very good. An exciting reintroduction of a great performance. (The other 3 Ring operas will be releases in the next 15 months, according to Warner. Das Rheingold is being released on February 28.)",1133654400,59,2896,5.045929018789144

8059657,5,B0009EMOPQ,"The biggest surprise for me when first experiencing this set of the Ring was the effect of considerable movement - much of it fast and urgent. This is a concept far from the old style of `stand and deliver' and it achieves a considerable culminative effect when followed through the whole set of four operas. However, for the purposes of this review I will restrict myself to this single opera.

Quick movement is important to this production as mentioned above. John Tomlinson is able to portray Wotan as both a dominant and as an unstable character by rapid changes of direction and by telling use of his spear. Considerable use is made of the vast stage at Bayreuth so that Wotan and other characters can move rapidly around unfettered by limitations of space. This enables this entire production to differ fundamentally from many other conceptions that frequently have far less urgent movement and which rely upon other means to achieve their purpose.

Quite apart from the purely musical considerations, this set makes extensive use of laser technology. This is often in the form of shafts of light than can vary in thickness from narrow shafts to sheets of colour.

The time period is established as modern but of an indeterminate moment as in Hunding's home. Key dramatic staging moments are effective - none more so than at the end where the fires summoned by Wotan are all-engulfing but finally part to show Brunnhilde enclosed in a laser casket. The groups of dead heroes shown as a backdrop to the Walkure at the start of Act 3 are clearly models however and they move jerkily - an interesting but unsuccessful idea. The Walkure are excellent however. The sense of the epic is totally established throughout this set along with the awareness of Wotan's essential instability of character which makes him vulnerable to the errors of judgement which inevitably lead to his and the gods ultimate downfall. This is drama writ large and Barenboim, the producer, the cast and the orchestra fully deliver on all counts.

None of this would be worthwhile of course if the musical values were inadequate. In this case the whole cast delivers consistently high standards with not a weak moment anywhere. The key dramatic sung moments are all delivered as they should be. The sound is magnificent and fully supports Barenboim's driving energy. Marvellous.

The recording dates from 1992 but has already been digitally enhanced and would presumably be a strong candidate for a future Blu-ray presentation. What cannot be solved is the considerable amount of trailing light as the film technology of the time could not keep up with the faster actions in the predominantly dark lighting. However I personally find the trailing image effects surrounding the various characters as they move swiftly about rather effective as it emphasises their essentially unpredictable and often unbalanced mental and physical speed. Strange, as normally I would find this a distracting visual problem but it is almost a total positive here. The sound is thrillingly 'real' and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo.

I also own the Blu-ray set by La Fura Dels Baus which is quite another type of satisfying experience and certainly not a direct competitor.
Nevertheless I unhesitatingly find that this is my benchmark preferred version and therefore equally unhesitatingly give it the full 5 stars even bearing in mind the 1992 recording issues as described above.",1342396800,,3442,5.008741258741258
8059658,4,B0009EMOPQ,"Wotan, the Father of Battles as Wagner calls him, was a vengeful vainglorious tyrant, a captious capricious egomaniac. But isn't that the image of God in every religion? Inasmuch as Wagner's own libretto for""Die Walkre"" makes a theological point, it seems to be something oxymoronic about the Limits of Omnipotence. Or one could perhaps argue that ""Die Walkre"" demands a psychological interpretation, as a drama about incest. This staging certainly suggests the latter, as the twins Sieglinde and Siedmund 'couple' discretely on stage, with cosmic consequences, and Wotan plainly lusts for his Valkyrie daughter. However, the real Leitmotif of ""Die Walkre"" is sung plainly enough by Wotan in the second act: """"The free man must create himself.""""

Or elsewhere in the same act: """"There is need of a Hero, without divine protection, who can free himself from divine law.""""

A Hero. Who can free himself from divine law. Wow! No wonder Wagner was Hitler's favorite composer. And Nietzsche's also, until Nietzsche grasped the consequences of such presumptuousness. The ""wisdom"" Wotan half-blinded himself for was preternaturally close to Nazism, to ""the Triumph of the Will"" and to every other hero-worshiping Romanticism since the mid 19th C. ""Will"" is what Wotan preaches and presumably what Wagner idealized.

Squirming closer to our own deluded times, note how appropriate Wotan's 'self-creating hero' is to the ethical philosophy of Ayn Rand, who argued for rational egoism as the sole moral principle. The Hero should ""exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself."" Rand referred to egoism as ""the virtue of selfishness"" in her book of that title, in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of ""man's survival qua man"". Is my memory correct that Rand was a big Wagner fan? But poor Wagner died far too young to have become an ""objectivist"".

This is my source of discomfort with the operas of Richard Wagner. I detest his elitist philosophical blather. I object to hearing such majestic music put to the demeaning task of expressing such hateful nonsense. And a production in 'modern' dress, like this one, compounds my distress by implying that Wagner's pernicious Romanticism can be made pertinent to real life after the horrors of the 20th Century. No, I do not blame Richard Wagner for the Holocaust. Pay attention! What I'm saying is that Wagner's anti-moral philosophy was consistent with Nazism on one side and Libertarianism on the other, and that Wagner's musical genius at glorifying the Will and the Superman was lamentably effective.

So much for the meta-message. There are also some specific problems with this production, with its sparse stage and its inconsistent quality of vocal technique. Undeniably, a singer needs a huge voice and stamina to sing Wagner. John Tomlinson as Wotan fulfills that need, as does Poul Elming as Siegmund. Nadine Secunde comes very close as Sieglinde. Anne Evans doesn't have the diaphragm for Brnnhilde, though her stage presence is powerful. All of them are over-challenged by the physical demands of this dramatic staging; they're required to run upstage and down, to fling themselves about, to sing flat on their backs and in various contorted embraces. It can't be easy to sing magniloquently when one is puffing for breath.

Then there's the inevitable silliness of Wagner, the overblown pomposity that has always drawn guffaws from the ""unwashed"" public. The high point of absurd self-parody in this production comes with the ""Ride of the Walkre"" at the opening of the third act, when we see the Battle Maidens trotting daintily down an illuminated fire-escape from Valhalla, dressed in storm-trooper black leather trench-coats and wielding transparent plastic shields but all looking exactly like the rosy-cheeked Sankt Pauli Girl of the beer commercials. Oy! Beer maids on the rampage! Honestly, their 'Hey-ya-ho-ho' chant, and the Wa-ga-la-weia of the Rhine Maidens in ""Das Rheingold"" will never fail to make me snicker after reading Wolfgang Koeppen's masterpiece novel ""Treibhaus"" (The Hothouse).

But let's end with applause for the music. The loudest applause for the softest music, especially throughout the first act. Wagner's restraint and subtlety impress me more than his exuberant dynamics, and his orchestral passages always seem to express more depth of meaning than his words. If I could hear a production of ""The Ring"" in Hungarian or Hebrew, I might be converted to a standing-ovation Wagnerite.",1322006400,,4606,5.258503401360544

Watch it over and over again.
I must disagree with NC from Ohio, who finds the Walkyrie ramp tacky and the singers overly caffeinated. I find the energy and beautiful singing of the Valkyries on their ramp inspiring.
In fact, the entire production is beautifully done. The singers don't just stand there, they drink their coffee and act. The Bayreuth Festival Orchestra under Barenboim is outstanding, and the singers are uniformly excellent. Harry Kupfer's laser light show is spectacular. John Tomlinson as Wotan is a hoot.

8059661,5,B0009EMOPQ,"Paul Elming and Nadine Secunde are the best Siegfried/Sieglinde couple I have seen.  They bring youth, vitality and joy to their discovery of love scene that Ring viewers have come to love.  At the same time, Barenboim's exquisite control of the orchestra's intensity allows us to hear Wagner's leitmotifs--signature tunes--one after another, in a dazzling way that adds another dimension to the scene on stage.

Just when you think that the highlight of this Walkure will be Siegmund/Sieglinde, along come John Tomlinson and Anne Evans with a Wotan/Brunnhilde that is electrifying.  Near the end of Die Walkure, along with the touching love between Wotan and his daughter, who disobeyed him in order to try to please him, we are treated to perhaps the best-ever introduction of the Siegfried/Redemption theme that we will hear later in Gotterdammerung.

The laser light show used by director Harry Kupfer seems especially effective, augmented by lots of clouds of smoke for the closing scene featuring the Magic Fire music.

You should find this a very memorable Die Walkure, both for the unique stage effects and the superb singing and acting.",1231632000,,1145,5.162162162162162
8059662,3,B0009EMOPQ,"This is such a frustrating production.  I only have Walkure and do not plan to purchase the rest.  I wanted to give it away, but there are a few elements here strong enough to make me keep it in my collection.

The set for the first act begins as Siegmund enters from the deep end of the stage making his way to the center trying to avoid light beams flashing from the floor. Once he comes to a rest the floor slowly rises to become part of the ceiling and Siegmund jumps through a hole of that lifting floor into what becomes Hunding's living room.  There he meets the comely Sieglinde and the rather petulant Hunding.  They of course had a pretty shiny, twisty looking tree in their living room.

The second act pretty much takes place on an empty stage covered, with the floor opening up during Wotan's monologue, and where Brunnhilde ends up doing something by the end of the act.  (Don't ask)
.
The third act is quite entertaining with the staging of the Ride.  Of course since we don't have hefty girls riding winged horses, we now have this platform that swithbacks (or zig zags) from the ceiling to the ground.  It is here that the Valkyries run up and down crying out their Hojotohos.  Meantime there are dozens of pods on the ground that are just being moving around or being wheeled around, I guess to represent mumified heroes?  Don't know.  Couldn't tell you.
Once the Valkyries leave the stage and the platform raises back up to the ceiling the we are back to the empty stage again where Brunnhilde and Wotan go through their dialogue.  For her slumber Wotan places Brunnhilde in this hanging neon lighted cube in the middle of the stage with light beams flashing on and off to signify flames.  That part I thought was quite neat; if I don't care for the rest of the production, this one section I do watch over and over.

Anyway you have a group of dedicated singing actors to convince even if their vocal means are rather modest.  Both sopranos, Nadine Secunde (Sieglinde)  and Anne Evan (Brunnhilde) are very good singers but rather short on top.  Poul Elmung is an accpetable Siegmund, but unfortunately some close ups make him look a little psychotic.  Secunde looks rather puffy in her close ups.  Neither one is helped by the harsh lighting and act I falls rather flat, particularly in comparison with Boulez/Chereau ""Walkure"".  The Hunding and Fricka are less interesting unfortunately.

The one outstanding element is John Tomlinson's Wotan.  The man is a force of element. His Wotan is supremely self confident, highly expressive, and very passionate.  Plus he is not bad vocally.  And it doesn't hurt that he is probably the sexiest Wotan of all these Rings on DVD.

Daniel Berenboim's conducting is grand and exciting, and the orchestra plays extremely well for him.  Supposedly his model is Furwangler, but at times he sounds closer to Karajan, which is just as good.
The videography is very well done.  I havent' seen this production on HD but the sound is wonderful.  The main reason I have not given up this DVD is because of the great sound even on my limited television sound.  The other reason I keep this DVD is John Tomlinson's Wotan.

I have Beremboim's ""Gotterdammerung"" on CD of this same staging team.  After viewing this ""Walkure"" I have no plans to get the rest of the cycle.  One star for the music, one star for the sound, and one star for Mr. Tomlinson.",1221436800,,3397,4.608333333333333
8059663,5,B0009EMOPQ,"This is by far the most satisfying Die Walkure on DVD. Barenboim heads a stunning interpretation marked by a lack of idiosyncratic or arrogant intrusions. This has the beauty of Levine without the sluggish tempi, the intensity of Krauss, and a sense of the inevitable like Furtwangler. Now, I am not saying this is better than Krauss-but specifically regarding the DVD format-you cant do better. The staging is sparse and never intrusive. It will not offend traditionalists(which I am) yet will appeal to those seeking a new twist. The cast is remarkable-John Tomlinson may be the greatest Wotan of our time-post Hotter. While James Morris DVD account is extraordinary-Tomlinson may not entirely equal him in beauty, but he far surpasses him in the more intense moments in an interpretation that is remarkably similiar to the ""father of Wotans"" Hans Hotter.
 This DIE Walkure is your best choice on DVD and is musically extraordinary(Anne Evans as Brunnhilde is stunning). Unfortunetaly, I Cannot recommend the other three DVD's on this cycle-they are ridiculous and the ending of Gotterdammerung is an insult to the talent and supreme muscianship of all those involved in this modern treasure.

8059664,5,B0009EMOPQ,"The physicality alone of this music pitting the human voice against the darknesses within the orchestra, the vocal dialogues as the wrath of Wotan,against lower strings (cellos and contrabasses) initiating contracts he had, and the wars he fought in behalf of Der Walsung Race. All the roles here are very strong and convincing, even Hunding, with those quick paraphlegic nods of the head in his confrontation with the wanderer Siegmund are powerful signifiers of character. The arrogant Hunding doesn't quite have the muscle against Wotan, but the projection of a Hunding is admirable, an enterprising man, protected by wealth and tribal connections.

Wotan,the God; do not be mislead here has a double function, I guess no one has commented on the Rock (as in rock'n roll)association he has,a cultural demigod; He looks like Jerry Garcia, from the Grateful Dead for example,or Wolfman Jack and many times this image has a bit of the anarchic,spontaneous combustion which to some degree never is reliquished throughtout this production.""Steal This Empire!"" The fact also that Wotan becomes a Wanderer,like Jim Morrison, or Cane, destined to walk the earth is a good metaphor,here Wotan is self-indulgent spreading his seeds far over the universe,reneging on contracts (he refused to payoff the Giants)soliciting a fatricide;He loved to be in the presence of luscious seductive women, and created their race here of warrior women, But he loved Brunhilde the most,and there is the connection to his weakness, for you cannot be everything to everyone; even though she betrayed his discourse, his wrath. His domestication dialogues with Fricka in their Duet is full bodied with the ""Ethel Merman-type"" persona as Fricka utilized here.
Anne Evans as Brunhilde projects a vulnerability,she doesn't have a large voice to hide behind; tall yet with soft gentle features, stout angular face,quite(unlike the more man-like Birgit Nilsson)yet Ms. Evans is a woman with depth and committment,like Sieglinde, a woman with passion and conscious for justice; cut from the same stock:(the auburn hair of both helps identify this race from Wotan)Brunhilde has the strength though to do what needs to be done; to eradicate the tyranny of the mindless Gods when they choose to snuff out life, much like what we see today in the criminal dimensions of the Bush Administration.

The incredible ending where Wotan summons his ""advisor"" Loge(not just a Fire-God) to protect Brunhilde in an eternal stasis is incredible.(Well only a ""True"" Hero can rescue her, someone with powers beyond ordinary mortals; Here she is enclosed in a laser protected Red Transparent Cube, with additional laser-lines shooting in all directions utilized as barriers trip-wires, much like what Banks, Mints and museums use to protect wealth and precious treasures. The long duet prior is well paced,the eternal bliss of fatherly love, (where is her Mother?)Brunhilde's Mother should have known of her demise;
Barenboim's true musical genius is situated in Wagner through the tempi  gradations following the powerful phrases. It all works best. His approach is always dramatically impassioned,yet with discipline which is why when he does conducts works more strickly instrumetal focus, as Brahms and Bruckner Symphonies,he fails to some degree,in this durational excess. Wagner's art was more open,allowing for the narrative to be re-thought through with each generation of artists. The orchestral playing is well balanced,forceful not sacrificing color in any respect. We seem to not miss the details of the Boulez reading,Barenboim is more full-tilt. If you have a good stereo system this balance is incredible, clear and there is no dilution of the dark lower strings timbres,contrasted with the more reed-like earthy timbres in the rediscovery duets between Siegmund and Sieglinde. It is commonplace now to have excellent acting ability in all the roles, and that is an integral part of this production. Even within the Walkure themselves, personas emerge from them with the scant lines they sing. They wish they could have done more to help Brunnhilde, but Die Walkure are under contract as well, to serve Wotan's wishes.

The large stage, dark and desolate also works quite well here, not encumbering the stage with distractions as we have found like in the Met's 1980s production with fake/plastic shrubbery and trees verging on kitsch. This production eliminates this simply changing a set when needed. The stage itself here has a double function,,as in the opening Act when we see Siegmund seeking shelter, climbing down,(like he is chinning himself)with a metal bar scaling into Hunding's elegant yet primitive dining room, then later when both brother and sister are banished both ascend upwards, the center part of the stage is lowered into an image of a large white cliff. Simple changes like this are quite extraordinary and effective without being a distraction. The continuous contrast between what is primitive civilization with more technological features, as lights,polished wood,modern dress and glass,gives this RING an added dimension of ambiguity, timeless. The Valykries for example descend a spacecraft;a slim-stainless steel long stairways,(Eiffel like webbing) from the top of the stage,down perpendicular. But  this travel is supposedly on ""Horses"", Brunhilde would never forsake her Grane-Horse, that brought her into battles. They bring back fallen heroes, information on how to win battles, like Lacan Knowledge Agency subservient to the Master Signifier, (Wotan in this instance) in his ""Four Discourses"" All these details I think add-up to a wonderfully inspired RING.",1187222400,2,5657,5.394796380090498
8059665,4,B0009EMOPQ,"My initial reaction to Kupfer's Ring was based on a viewing via a VHS of the Rheingold and Walkure.  To say that I was unenthusiastic was mild.  Then Warner Music re-released the CD version and a friend lent it to me.  First the sound: rich, emotionally involving, broad, but not ponderous tempi.  Yes, Wagnerian singers are not what they used to be: light, not exactly heroic, but in this case I found Evans to be more listenable than Behrens or Jones, even though the latter's bona fides as a Wagnerian Soprano were unassailable even though voice could let her down.  No, the revelation for me was John Tomlinson.  I bought the first two operas and one Saturday night I was transfixed.  What had seemed so-so was now something quite different.  I am reluctant to say that viewing it as DVD rather than a VHS made the difference, but I am certain that that had something to do with it.  Obviously the sound on a DVD is not going to sound as good as my stereo equipment, but there is an improvement with the DVD.  Essentially I found myself gripped by the dramatic committment of all the major singers.  Kupfer asks for a great deal and the singers delivered both physically and dramatically.  I eagerly awaited the release of Siegfried.  It was devastating when Warner released the wrong region in the US. However all good things come to he who waits and I was rewarded.  Even more than the first operas, Siegfried has been staged in some sort of apolyptic future, a kind of ""mad max"" setting.  Siegfried wears a mechanics blue jump suit.  Red hair, of course, in view of the gene pool. It was a far more engrossing performance than the one he did for Levine, far more involving. Graham Clark is a superb Mime, oily, devious, pathetic and ultimately evil.  Kupfer's Wotan has been criticized as being more of a manipulator than he should be.  This didn't bother me as there are so many interpretations available.  Brunhilde's awakening again will upset or irritate: Heil der Sonne. Well there is no sun but there is passion, involvement and again committment.  She is somewhat overparted since this Brunhilde's vocal line lies higher than Walkure but she manages the high C at the end if without the power of a Nilsson, Flagstad or Varnay it is truly sung, not screamed.  I await the release of the Gotterdammerung with increasing impatience.",1163030400,11,2343,4.679706601466993
