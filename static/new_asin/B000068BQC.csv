I mean, I make amature documentaries myself, but I got better and more suffisticated equipment than this maker.

Very sloppy and cheap editing; useless information, given to the viewer with a homevideocamera put on a tripod, focussing on the wall of the filmmaker's living room, upon which he hung a self drawn chart. Geez, could it be anymore amaturistic?!

The actual hurricane footage was  was here and there interesting, but when you watch the same camera position for more than 2 minutes, it ""tends"" to get boring.

Conversations of the one's that were filming live footage was several times cut off, by editing.

And the #1 thing I can't understand, was the use of music. Like the other review already said, a very strange and bizarre choice of music, which in no way suits to the images. What this producer was thinking of, using this music, is beyond me! And then the price; very overpriced; not even worth one fifth of the price. Save your 25 bucks. If it wasn't for the fact that I ordered this through Amazon, I would not believe that this was an official movie. If I would ordered it second hand, I would have left the seller negative feedback for selling illegal copies, because that's what the tape appears to be. A cheap xeroxed cover, and a cheap tape. Definately not worth your money.",1105056000,,1435,4.674603174603175
7963909,1,B000068BQC,"For anyone interested in the effect Hurricane Hugo had in the United States, this video is without value. It has virtually no footage of the hurricane itself in this part of the world, and only the most sketchy and undramatic account of the hurricane's effects in South Carolina and elsewhere, which were far more spectacular than this video indicates.  For someone who was primarily interested in Hugo's effect on Puerto Rico, the video might be more satisfactory. But even the Puerto Rican coverage is made up of long, often tedious videos of wind and rain sweeping across rooftops and parking lots.  The musical background for the video is bizaare.  What might Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"" have to do with hurricanes?  And any loyal South Carolinian is going to resent the use of ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" for the scanty footage of our state.",1095638400,,848,4.868055555555555
