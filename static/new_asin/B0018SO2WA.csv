Disc One: Dear Pam

Crystal Sync ... Pam Slanders

Jennifer Jordan ... Rose Cumming

C.J. Laing ... Gladys Mygrain

Lorraine Alraune ... Jean Kumkwik (as Beverly Bovy)

Ginger Snaps ... Sandy Phallis

Roberta Findlay ... Miss Klug (as Anna Riva)

The print is good with both video and sound decent for a movie of that era.

Eric Edwards is a brash horndog businessman that first lays C.J.Laing during a receptionist interview in a restaurant booth, taking her virginity in the process. Then he does his friends wife in the bathtub, and she afterward announces that she has become pregnant from their affair, and then after returning home he does his step-daughter in her bed while she pretends to be dreaming of screwing her boyfriend as she screws Eric.

Next we find Tony Perez getting accosted by an underage girl and soon she is complaining about and then enjoying Tony's oversized meat. Tony then returns to Jennifer Jordan, and deaf to her protests, he shoves his shaft into her as well.

Back at the office Jennifer Jordan arrives and proceeds to go down on C.J. Laing, who afterward falls asleep on the couch. Moments later John Holmes enters and decides to screw her while she's sleeping, though she of course wakes up and makes a weak protest as her recently de-virginized  pussy is stuffed with Johns giant stick.

Next Holmes and Crystal Sync get it on, which leads into the end of the movie Orgy scene that includes C.J. Laing deepthroating John Holmes.

Disc Two:

This Disc contains 10 Loops with John Holmes and unknown ladies with no sound. Almost half the clips are in color and there is penetration in all the scenes as I recall.",1279497600,16,1836,4.753164556962025
8271054,3,B0018SO2WA,"It's hard to view a John Holmes movie without thinking about the movie Boogie Nights. I don't know how close Boogie Nights was to actual facts but it leaves an impression. Are John Holmes movies just 70's porn or are they historical evidence of a famous person, regardless of his profession. Obviously his fame is not the results of his acting ability nor his good looks. He was tall and skinny,some what athletic, and blessed or cursed, however you want to look at it, with an over-sized member of his anatomy which he put to use to make money and fame. He died in his forties from aids so the addage ""He who lives by the sword dies by the sword"" is some what appropriate. He definitely had a sword and he lived by it.
This package that 42nd Street Pete put together has some interesting things in it and some surprises. The main feature is pretty much a standard 70's porno except you actually hear the characters speaking with their own voices. The only voice overs occured when the action got hot. Even though the voice overs didn't make sense it was better than some of the insane music that is often played in these movie types. Two surprises. One of the lead female roles is played by one of Joe Sarno's girls. If you study these type of films you will often see actresses who bounce from hard core to soft core to B movies and some even in bit parts in movies a little higher up than B movies. Rene Bond is probably the most recognized but there were quite a few others as well. They must have been busy ladies. The second surprise is that I did not recognize Big John until his pants came down. He was sporting a poofy hairdo
and some whiskers. I'll admit he looked better than that slicked back hair he normally wore. As for a plot there was one but as is typical with this movie type it is least important. The actresses weren't bad looking. Good bodies.
The ten 8MM collection of shorts,and some were very short,had mixed quality. Most had lighting problems so it distracted from the content. Some were good. All had one thing in common besides John,that was good looking women. Of all the women involved I only saw one bimbo. It's hard to imagine that women of good looks and great figures were willing to subject themselves to that kind of uncomfortableness if you no what I mean. One gets the feeling that John worked with the best quality gals who performed in that type of work.
I gave this package 3 stars for it's historical significance. John Holmes was a legend in his own time. Whether we approve of his career choices and life style really is insignificant. He was a historical figure. If you just want porn you can find better. If you want some one who was a legend in porn this might suit your needs.",1253059200,14,2725,4.408730158730159
