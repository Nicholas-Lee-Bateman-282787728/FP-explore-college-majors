8414796,4,B000IZJQWA,"This film is a copy of throw momma of the train, but its more funnier. I cant really imagine any Hindi actor playing Danny Devitos role. Because it does not suit an Indian actor trying to kill his mum or grandma and at the same time its comedy. Govinda yet does a pretty good job, i can only imagine Akshay Kumar playing this role. Its a hard role to do but Govinda does a good performance. Rani plays Billy Crystals role as the actress and she is AL right. Rani is my favourite actress and god bless her she is wonderful. The film is non stop outrageous but fun comedy. The grandma in the film is so funny Zohra, she is great in her role. The film has the usual Johnny Lever and Kader Khan who are terrific.",1302220800,,708,4.13768115942029
