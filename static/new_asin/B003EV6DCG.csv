4115734,5,B003EV6DCG,"Once upon a time this film would have been released in theatres and this lead performance and maybe even Brenda Vaccaro's would have been nominated for Academy Awards. That is how good this film is, award worthy, notable for it's stellar execution and story, a standout for this year. Al Pacino's Jack Kevorkian is not his best work in a decade, as some have speculated. It is his best work since Angels in America (from 2003), also an HBO produced and presented film. He is as commanding in that amazing series as in this. Pacino has always been physically gifted as an actor; adept at expressing his emotions with his back or his head, his hands or his walk. I think his reputation as actor has suffered in the last twenty years because he moved away from using his body (essential to the art of acting) and compensated with his voice. In this context, this film is a return to form: Donnie Brasco, Carlito's Way, Glengarry Glen Ross, Scent of a Woman, Dick Tracy, to name his best work since 1990.

You Don't Know Jack is an apt title for this film, because I was certainly aware of Jack Kevorkian growing up, knew he was an advocate and involved in euthanasia and that he went to prison, but I didn't know he was such an iconoclast; morbid, graphic and unapologetic painter, a musician, a bachelor and a civil disobedient. These characteristics add to his legend, and his stature as a doctor who seems to have taken his profession and life's work as something more than a path to prestige and wealth, which cannot be said of some doctors in truth and perhaps too many in reputation. The role of the physician in society is an aspect of the successful story told here.
The role of the politician and the collective social fears of death in our society are the other themes, and they too are well told.
Though Kevorkian is presented sympathetically, and his opponents are not; angry ""Christians"" in general and a politically vengeful D.A. specifically, it is ultimately his own folly that dooms him. This may speak to his bachelorhood, his unemployment at the outset of the film and his stubbornness at getting to the Supreme Court. But his ambitions are not clarified here, other than his humanism, which is made genuine in small moments as well as big.

I highly recommend this film. Al Pacino and Jack Kevorkian are in the center of it, and the other actors, particularly Vaccaro as his sister Margo, are excellent. Euthanasia is an issue brought to the forefront by Kevorkian, but his incarceration did not produce another advocate in his stead, and the issue has unfortunately fallen by the wayside. It is an important consideration, what power we have over ourselves when we are faced with imminent pain before our death. This film handles it incredibly well, and I hope it produces as much discussion and thought for you as it did for me.

Thanks.",1272412800,86,2856,4.662698412698413
4115735,4,B003EV6DCG,"As you already know, most people who watch this film have already formed an opinion about doctor-assisted suicide.  So rather than discuss ethics, this review will simply be about the film itself.

What stands out most about this movie is the terrific performance by Al Pacino, which is easily his best in the last decade.  Al slips effortlessly into character, and delivers a nuanced performance that honestly makes you forget you're watching a Pacino film.  I was also impressed with the zeal that Danny Huston brought to his portrayal of Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's outspoken attorney.

I found the film to be revealing, but fairly unbiased in its portrayal of Kevorkian.  While you're provided with an understanding of his motive by the film's conclusion, you're still presented with both sides of the debate.  The movie also doesn't pull any punches with respect to revealing some of Kevorkian's eccentricities, or the self-deprecating ""quack"" jokes that take place.  The film obviously calls for a little levity, and is punctuated by the occasional light joke.  The cinematography and lighting was quality, and I enjoyed the peaceful score by Brazilian composer Marcelo Zarvos.

Overall, I think the film is worth watching for Pacino's performance alone.  I don't think there's anything about the movie that would change someone's perspective, but for better or worse it sheds some light on Kevorkian's beliefs.",1272240000,52,1418,5.257777777777778
4115736,5,B003EV6DCG,"Director Barry Levinson ('Diner', 'The Natural', 'Good Morning, Vietnam', 'Rain Man', 'Avalon', Bugsy', etc) has obviously taken a chance with his latest film YOU DON'T KNOW JACK, a cinematic evaluation of the notorious and controversial Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the Detroit pathologist who upon retiring from his career felt compelled to create a manner for people suffering chronic disease, paralytic illness, chemotherapy failures, and those pleading to die with dignity to have a choice as to whether they by law must linger in misery or be given the opportunity to have a doctor assisted suicide.  Whether or not viewers react positively or negatively to this film for HBO will probably be tainted with personal convictions about assisted suicide rather than whether the film is worthy or a diatribe.  But that is the still ongoing dilemma of the topic raised by the elderly Armenian physician's choices or convictions and one that the film explores well.

As for the film itself, it is a tour de force of acting performances: Al Pacino transforms himself physically and technically to bring the personality of Jack Kevorkian to life.  It is a role of so many fine nuances that demonstrates ho Pacino  truly does inhabit the title of the film.  This Kevorkian is shown to be a man driven to be an outspoken activists for human rights - especially the right to die.  His sister Margo, played to perfection by Brenda Vacarro, is the lonely Jack's sole source of emotional support, while his old friend and hospital medic Neal Nicol (who technically assists Kevorkian) is made a three dimensional person by John Goodman.  Another supporter is the Hemlock Society worker Janet Good, another fine role for Susan Sarandon, and Danny Huston (almost unrecognizable in a wig) is Jack's pro bono lawyer Geoffrey Fieger.  The technique used by Kevorkian is to interview people who approach him pleading to end their lives (some have tried regular suicide attempts before), make a video of the patient and family requesting assisted suicide, be sure the family and patient are serious and ready and only then provide the service with a contraption loaded with sedative and KCL  that is triggered by the patient.  Many of the actual patients are reenacted by a cadre of fine actors in scenes of pleading that tug at the heart.

Kevorkian is placed on trial by the courts in Michigan and finally after 133 assisted suicides is sentenced to prison - but not until after frequent jailings accompanied by Kevorkian's hunger strikes have resulted in his being released due to the finesse of his lawyer. Though Kevorkian has a large number of people who feel he is a cruel serial killer, this film presents the more human side of a man motivated to provide an alternative to patients suffering the lingering agonies of medically approved slow deaths.  There are several tender scenes in this film, but the one that is a triumph of writing and acting is a conversation between Sarandon and Pacino as to what happened in Jack's childhood that began the idea for his mission.  If viewers can get past their personal issues with the subject, then they will be witness to a superb film and terrific acting that will likely lead to an Emmy for at least Pacino.  Watch this and learn.  Grady Harp, April 10",1272153600,23,3280,4.9041591320072335
4115737,1,B003EV6DCG,"A Court TV report on Jack Kevorkian's trial for assisting in the suicide of Thomas Hyde is available on VHS:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michigan-Vs-Kevorkian/dp/1572521449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michigan Vs Kevorkian</a>.  In that VHS, we learn that Kevorkian's sister, the late Margot Janus (who, by the way, was far better looking than the actress who portrays her in this HBO film), assisted Kevorkian & subsequently testified at his trial.  For unknown reasons, however, this HBO film presents Margot Janus as preceding Thomas Hyde in death.  Why on earth would it be necessary to change such basic information?  It leaves me curious as to what else in this film has been fictionalized (I believe the Court TV VHS to also show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-real-life-Jack-Kevorkian-and-Jeffrey-Fieger/dp/1572521449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the real life Jack Kevorkian and Jeffrey Fieger</a>&nbsp;to be far less likeable than the actors who portray them.  And by the way, how did Al Pacino get the idea that Kevorkian had that peculiar accent?).  As recorded by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Court-TV/dp/1572521449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Court TV</a>, Kevorkian, Fieger, and Janus appear to have had utter disdain for the sanctity of human life, as well as for basic honesty.

If it can be trusted, the HBO film tells us that Kevorkian is the child of survivors of the Armenian Genocide.  If that is accurate, it leaves me especially baffled to try to explain his disdain for the sanctity of human life.

In the HBO film, the Kevorkian character argues that assisted suicide is supposedly far more humane than death by starvation (such as what was subsequently inflicted on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terri-Schiavo/dp/B00394DOPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terri Schiavo</a>).  This is a pointless argument, as both are absolutely IMMORAL.

Certainly, Jack Kevorkian has been one of the foremost ""prophets"" of what the late John Paul II called ""the Culture of Death.""  While appeals may be made to the emotions that hastening death will ease suffering, this must be recognized as a heinous and dangerous philosophy.  Rather than recognizing that each human being is of incomparable worth, ""the Culture of Death"" can see no value in human life, when there is disability, disease, suffering, or weakness.  There is no understanding that a human life is not to be ""put down,"" as a vet might treat the sick family pet.

For the Christian,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JP-II/dp/0819814849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JP II</a>&nbsp;reminded us (as has philosopher&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Kreeft/dp/0892832193/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Kreeft</a>) that unsolicited pain can be an opportunity to share in Christ's own suffering & a uniting with Him in His redemptive sacrifice, offered in obedience to His father. This is not masochism, & it certainly does not mean that all legitimate efforts to alleviate suffering/pain need to be be foregone.",1272153600,14,3250,6.578454332552694

I am so glad this movie was made, all my belief in this brave man has come rushing back. He should not have taken his final assisted suicide to the media, and he should not have represented himself in court - those were his only mistakes. But I understand he did it because he so deeply believed in the importance of what he was doing. It's disheartening that this issue in the U.S. seems to have died with Dr. Kevorkian.

4115801,4,B003EV6DCG,"The top-rate actors are what make this movie memorable; Al Pacino, Brenda Vaccaro, Susan Sarandon and John Goodman are completely believable in their roles. Al Pacino so inhabited the role that it was difficult to recognize him as Al Pacino! Kevorkian, and his crusade to provide assisted suicide to more than 100 suffering people, grabbed a lot of headlines in the 1990's when he was tried and acquitted 4 times. In 1999, he was tried and convicted of 2nd degree murder and served the next 8 years in prison. He lived another 4 years, but never assisted in another suicide.

The film tells the story of how Kevorkian arrived at his conviction that assisted suicide was humane and necessary, and also depicts his methods in which the patient makes the final move to end his life by starting the flow of gas. Kevorkian designed and set up the equipment, but the patient always made the final decision. There are many emotional scenes where we meet people who are suffering from painful and debilitating illnesses. Many people thought Kevorkian was some kind of kook, and his quirky, abrasive personality certainly did nothing to help him acquire supporters. He certainly elevated the discussion on the topic of euthanasia, a discussion that remains highly charged and emotional to this day.

The fact that Pacino manages to portray him with such gentle encompassing grace is simply a joy to behold. Both Pacino and John Goodman as well as Brenda Vaccaro are all known for playing large colorful characters primarily. The restraint they all demonstrate in this film exactly what characters so committed yet humane require.  Kevorkian describes himself as a zealot at some point. Most people don't understand that zealots don't have to be loud bombastic soap box preachers..Pacino plays a zealot I want to hug. He gets it. He understands the commitment.

I learned a lot about Jack Kervorkian that I didn't know.  He was way ahead of his time regarding consensual euthanasia, something we all should be allowed to decide for ourselves when the time comes, if we find ourselves in irreversible physical or mental decline.  He was a hero, really, who paid a big price for stepping up to the plate to speak for all of those who cannot speak so eloquently for ourselves.",1427414400,,734,4.335766423357664

Some reviewers said the movie is slow and boring, well then this movie is definitely not for you, it is not an action movie and you need to sit quietly to enjoy it. Some reviewers said it is a one-side story and painted Dr. Kevorkian  as a hero, it is actually a pretty neutral movie and told the story from both side. It didn't hesitate to show the dumb decisions Dr. Kevorkian made  that put himself in prison.
After the movie, I went to wikipedia to read more about Dr. Kevorkian, I admire his courage and determination. He is a hero as far as I consider, fought for a person's freedom to determine his own death.",1427155200,2,703,4.318181818181818

4115887,5,B003EV6DCG,"As somebody who is being actively prevented from availing of this option, this film has been on my radar to watch for awhile, but I was afraid to in case assisted suicide was badly or inaccurately portrayed.  I'm breathing freely now and need not have worried.  From my perspective, the movie could have done more to make the case for those of us suffering from non-terminal illnesses whose suffering is enough to consider this as an option, and the added suffering of the whole world against taking this decision (at least initially), being demonised and ostracised etc.  That aside, the acting was superb, Al Pacino and Margo Janus of course, but also John Goodman and Susan Sarandon excelled from the perspective of having so little dialogue comparatively, what they weren't saying, I felt, was equally as important and significant to the storylines, as what they did say.

First do no harm.  This is the very well told story of one qualified man's fight to end the years of unnecessary pain and suffering caused by allopathic medicine and the laws that enforce it.

I am open to being sent royalties for the sequel ideas... which is... a follow up on the lives and impact on those who availed of the Service, and their survivors.",1426982400,,1233,4.765258215962441

All the scenes that portray private conversations are all made up.  Fiction.  As someone who suffers from pain, I can say I might want the option of suicide some day.  But this movie is nothing historical or important because it tells the story from one side by people who do not debate issues.  They either make the opposition look like radical Christian right wingers or total idiots.

Although there are a few hints of why this kind of work personally became so important to the doctor at the end of his career, most of the movie spends a lot of time dealing with how Dr. Kevorkian defied imprecise laws where assisted suicide and homicide cross paths.  The actor's indignation and rage in the court room scenes are classic Pacino.  I wish more time had been spent seeing things from the patients' point of view with a few more girppng scenes of their long and difficult roads of suffering to their final decision to end their own lives.  Perhaps then we could understand better reasons for allowing them to kill themselves.

4115923,5,B003EV6DCG,"This was an excellent movie with great actors - Pacino, Sarrandon. Vaccaro..... The movie treated the controversial Dr. Kervorkian  with empathy, as he treated his patients. It showed him as a multi faceted renaissance man who could not watch people suffer. Pacino did a powerful portrayal in this film. Kervorkian carefully screened patients. He involved their families. He would ask the patient
before the act of euthanasia, if they really wanted to continue. The patient would have to initiate the process that would end his or her life.

Some of these people would have suffered protracted deaths without dignity. Their families would have had to watch them suffer pain, gasping for air,  and inability to do anything but lie in bed and wait for death  -home or in a hospital- while the family was left in enormous debt and the traumatic stress of watching the ill person progressively decay.

Some people say Kervorkian was playing God?  But is it not playing God to resuscitate a person who will spend the rest of their life in a vegetative state with a feeding tube and bed sores?",1412726400,,1087,4.848648648648648

Growing up in the 90s, I have memories of the legal battles and stories of Dr. Death, but I am so satisfied to now know the whole story and know Jack! A scene that really captured the high caliber of the acting in this film (seriously Oscar worthy) was the intense argument between Jack and his sister in the diner. Its so raw and real. And then to have such a perfect ""let bygones be bygones"" apology later, I took a big mental note since I have trouble with apologies. Although he never married, he was blessed with some wonderful women in his life.",1392768000,,714,4.37593984962406
4115959,5,B003EV6DCG,"It was WONDERFUL to see actors who looked like REAL people! Great acting, very moving, well done movie.

As a person of Armenian descent I appreciated having the Armenian Holocaust discussed. Many people are unaware of it.

After watching this movie I felt unsure about Kevorkian. Was he really a compassionate, caring human being who wanted to stop suffering, or was he a psychologically unbalanced guy who liked the power of ending someone's life???

So I watched the excellent documentary ""Kevorkian"". This was a good, compassionate man, another human rights activist imprisoned by a corrupt and unfair judicial system.

He always wanted his clients to chose to live. But believed that they had to right to decide. Of note is that he never charged for his services.

Two things probably formed his character and activities-being the son of victims of the Armenian Holocaust, hearing the stories of it, and no doubt being traumatized by this-and the horrible experience of his Mother's death (I assume when he was an adult). They asked their doctor to help her die. He refused. So this poor woman had to suffer until the end.

Assisted suicide has it's problems and possible abuses. Thoughtful people have different views on it. Some objections come from authoritarian views in which human beings are not seen as being fully autonomous.

Arguments that we should not interfere with the natural processes as this interfers with 'God's will' truly do not hold water. We constantly interfere with natural processes in medical care, and certainly extreme measures such as feeding tubes and breathing machines are 'interference'. One can also ask, if God gives us these abilities, why would it be wrong to use them?

Our society still murders people as part of the 'justice system'. Young men and women die in illegal wars, Cheney and Bush commit war crimes and are never held accountable.

But this civil rights activist ends up in a maximum security prison??? For 8 years???

It was an atrocity that Kavorkian went to prison, but a maxium security prison??? No different than other countries who throw civil liberties advocates in jail.

In the documentary I mentioned, Mike Wallace told Kevorkian that he admired him. I do too.

He will go down in history as a Hero.",1392422400,,2266,4.965608465608466
4115960,4,B003EV6DCG,"My earliest memory of Jack Kevorkian came with a feature article in Cornerstone Magazine. The year was 1990 and Dr. Kevorkian had just entered the national spotlight after assisting in the suicide of Alzheimers patient Janet Adkins. The magazines feature interview left quite the impression. And it was deeply unsettling. Here was a man who was calling for obitoriums in major cities where people could go to be euthanized. Here was a man who cavalierly set aside any clearly articulated ethic, and eschewed all abstract philosophical or theological principles as guidelines for ethical conduct. Kevorkian seemed to do ethics by the seat of his pants. As he boldly declared:

Its ethical conduct within the framework of time and space. Ethical codes should never be set in stone. They cant be, they must change constantly. Thats why we have problems today, because most of the ethics are dictated by inflexible religious doctrine: Human life is divine, it cannot be ended. Who said it? I don't feel holy. You cant make one doctrine fit everybody. Its between patient and doctor. Thats all it is. Nothing else counts. The code of ethics should be based only on medical knowledge. No theology, no philosophic doctrines that are abstract. Only what is really valid medically! (Cornerstone Magazine, Vol. 19, issue 93, 1990).

It is true that circumstances change, and it is extremely difficult to anticipate every possible situation. But it was something altogether different (and more radical) to say that the very ethical codes that guide us in changing circumstances are themselves changing. The truth is that Kevorkian was not really following a post-philosophical ethic. Indeed, his endorsement of a radically contextualized patient/doctor relationship was clearly based on a situation ethics rooted in a protean principle of patient self-determination. In other words, he too was assuming a philosophic doctrine.

Over the next decade I heard about Kevorkian often in the news, and my impression was always the same: a brazen, secular narcissist who cared little for the established norms and ethics of civil society.

Yesterday I sat down to watch HBOs 2010 film You Dont Know Jack which tells Kevorkians story from the death of Janet Adkins up to his imprisonment in 1999. I had high hopes for the film: in my view HBO films are as reliably good as BMW sedans and Coldplay albums. And You Dont Know Jack didn't disappoint. Throughout the film I had to keep reminding myself that I was looking at Al Pacino playing Jack Kevorkian rather than Kevorkian himself. The other performances  including Susan Sarandon and John Goodman  were equally strong.

You Dont Know Jack is definitely a sympathetic bio-pic. Predictably there is little sympathy shown to the religious right opposition which is reduced to a handful of angry protesters furiously thrusting placards skyward as Kevorkian shuffles past. However, it is far from hagiography. The image of an emotionally stunted and impulsive figure comes through clearly. And more than once you get the sense that Kevorkian can be his own worst enemy as when he harangues entire courtrooms. In one memorable scene he attends a gala evening celebrating Time Magazines 75th anniversary, and he stands alone as a pariah as others stare on in Whats he doing here? bemusement. A martyr for a just cause, or a social outcast on the margins? The viewer is left to decide.

Today I am more sympathetic toward the idea of euthanasia than I was twenty-three years ago. That sympathy has grown out of real life cases like those narrated in the powerful 2011 documentary How do Die in Oregon and Frontlines 2010 documentary The Suicide Tourist.

At the same time, I am even more aware of the ethical complications. Once euthanasia becomes an option how do you avoid patients feeling pressure to choose death brought on by a financially taxed medical system and emotionally and financially taxed family members? And how do you avoid extending quality of life assessments beyond the woolly concept of terminally ill to those mentally depressed? And how can death intervention be reconciled to the physicians call to do no harm? And how do you protect the line between voluntary and involuntary euthanasia? As I write this review Belgium is considering extending its voluntary euthanasia law to children who are suffering unbearable pain. The decision would require a psychologist to ensure that the child understands the consequences of his/her decision. I find the idea astonishing. Which child can truly understand the consequences of death?

Kevorkians response that ethical codes change constantly is hardly comforting. Indeed, it might seem like little more than grease slathered on an already slippery slope. You Dont Know Jack doesnt provide many answers. But wow, does it ever raise the questions.

I would urge anyone with even a hint of interest in the topic of assisted suicide to watch this film. It raises a lot of questions but for me specifically, it raised a lot of anger; anger that Kevorkian was jailed for trying to help people.

4115967,5,B003EV6DCG,"Have you ever been seriously ill? Once you're told that you'll recover, you probably found it boring, more than anything else. What if you weren't going to get better? What would you do?

  Jack Kevorkian (played by Al Pacino) was a pathologist but, by the time we join the story he has left his career behind. His friends and colleagues say he's retired but Kevorkian (Pacino) states that retirement means you are no longer preoccupied with your chosen profession and that he is simply unemployed. Being unemployed, he has a great deal of free time and is intrigued by a local news story. A man who is paralyzed from the neck down wishes to end his life while the hospital caring for him is fighting to prevent it. Kevorkian had written several articles on euthanasia for foreign periodicals by that time and was now determined to make practical use of his theories. The hospital learned of his intentions, stopped him, and the patient died of starvation. Nevertheless, our protagonist continued his search for a patient. Assisting him in this quest, the doctor had longtime friend and colleague, Neal Nicol (played by John Goodman) and his loving sister, Margo (played by Brenda Vaccaro). In time, he is approached by a married couple, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's and her husband. This presents Kevorkian with an ethical dilemma, as Alzheimer's is not a fatal disease. Once Margo (Vaccaro) puts the matter in perspective, they begin devising a plan. While searching for a location, Kevorkian approached a member of the Hemlock Society by the name of Janet Good. Good (played by Susan Sarandon) offers the use of her home but later reneges. In spite of that, the plan is carried out and Kevorkian becomes national news.

  If you ask most people about the Right to Die movement, they'd probably tell you that reasonable people could disagree on the matter. Personally, I don't understand that, as I am an advocate of personal choice. Likewise, I believe this movie is incredible and cannot comprehend anyone thinking otherwise. Pacino has partnered with HBO on another project Phil Spector, about the renowned music producer. Maybe it's the fact that, deep down, Kevorkian is a sympathetic figure and Spector is not but, the latter film fell flat, at least for me. The story of You Don't Know Jack and supporting cast are incredible and Pacino himself won an Emmy for his performance, as he should've.

But it's still a excellent movie and Al Pacino becomes MR. K. in a almost complete fashion. The film looks great on dvd but it was shown in HD on HBO. The story itself is hugely important as we still don't have right to die laws in most states and they can make you die very slowly in a hospital unless you have someone help you out of this moral coil.  Jack himself and his sister have left the coil and are probably wondering why we are not allowing doctor assisted suicide in many states.

4115980,4,B003EV6DCG,"Al Pacino plays Jack Kevorkian brilliantly. His sister Margo Janus (Brenda Vaccaro) and his old friend Neal Nicol (John Goodman) do what they can to help him in his controversial crusade to bring relief to those in unbearable pain. His eager young lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger (Danny Huston) is of great help until he abandons Jack to make a run for governor of Michigan. Janet Good (Susan Sarandon) is head of the Hemlock Society and becomes a supporter, and eventually a patient, of Jack's.

Jack videotapes interviews with his patients, gets their written consent and the cooperation of their loved ones, and is careful to make the actual mechanism for the lethal subject to the patient's control. That is, he is careful to limit himself to assisted suicide and not direct-action euthanasia. Then Michigan passed a law against assisted suicide, mostly because he was acquitted by half a dozen juries on attempts to charge him with murder.

Finally, he decided that the issue would have to go to the Supreme Court, so he set up an intentionally provocative case. He went to ""60 Minutes"" with a video of his latest patient, whom he had injected directly instead of using the elaborate indirect procedures that made the patient's own action the cause of death. I'm explaining this badly, but it was very clear in the film, and especially in the ""60 Minutes"" video.

So the Michigan Attorney General figured he had an airtight case. He charged Jack with murder and assisted suicide, but then dropped the assisted suicide charge when it was pointed out that this would provide more latitude in the rules of evidence. Jack, who was determined to push this to the Supreme Court, welcomed the opportunity and was his own attorney of record.

He was found guilty and sentenced to prison. As to whether or not he lost, that's quite another matter. He has forced Americans to face the consequences of a medical technology that is quite capable of keeping people alive past any hope of a life worth living. He has boldly raised the extremely sensitive issue of the right to suicide.",1336694400,,2068,4.833333333333333

4115982,5,B003EV6DCG,"Al Pacino's performance of the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian would have won him his second Academy Award. He was already awarded the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards for his performance as the eccentric, brilliant, artistic doctor of death. He transforms himself into the character. The supporting cast is excellent with Emmy nominations for John Goodman (played Neil Nichol), Susan Sarandon (played Janet Good), and Brenda Vaccaro (played Margo Janus).

There are plenty of memorable moments in the film especially between Jack and his sister Margo Janus. Kevorkian had an excellent sense of humor even in his profession as a doctor. He was frugal and lived quite frugally. He was an artist who depicted morbid pictures in his art.

To know Jack Kevorkian, you would be surprised to see his eccentricity. He felt that he had a purpose in helping people die with dignity. Regardless of how you feel about Kevorkian, he didn't want to see people suffer and linger on needlessly. Regardless of how you feel about euthanasia or doctor assisted suicide, Kevorkian gladly went to prison and jail and a hunger strike for his purpose.

The DVD also showed a ten minute behind the scenes about Kevorkian's inner circle of friends and sister. Even Kevorkian makes an appearance, the film also used real life footage of Barbara Walters and Mike Wallace in his interviews with them.",1330473600,,1361,4.986784140969163

Throughout the history of Mankind, there are a plethora of unique individuals who stand as giants as they have changed the world. Columbus, Gailieo, Copernicus, Darwin and Einstein, have all fought a prevailing notion of a given era. To this famous list one can add the dedicated Dr. Jack Kavorkian. Born May 26, 1928 is an American pathologist, right-to-die activist and painter. His life is the center of this movie called "" You don't know Jack. "" Al Pacino, who bears an astonish resemblance, plays Dr. Jack Kevorkian and does an incredible job. Other notable thespians like Brenda Vaccaro, Susan Sarandon, John Goodman and Danny Huston all appear like towering pillars in a magnificent temple. Together their performance allows the audience to view the good doctor in his Herculeion task of establishing a man's right to die. Despite being ostracized, ridiculed, vilified, hounded and even imprisoned, Kavorkian continued and in the minds of millions of rational people, his struggle established the precedent for humans, not a puritanical government, to chose the time to die. Pacino's performance is exceptional and this movie will become a Classic for future audiences. Recommended to anyone willing to listen.",1324339200,,1331,5.214953271028038

If nothing else, Kevorkian got the country thinking about end of life decisions and certainly the film is sympathetic to his objectives if not his methodology.  Kevorkian was intent on taking the issue to the Supreme Court.  He spent 8 years in prison and the Court never took up the case on appeal.  The story is pretty well known, but here we get to meet many of the associates that were in the background.  Pacino is brilliant and is certainly deserving of the awards.  Watch the byplay between Al and Susan Sarandon who plays Janet Good a supporter and eventual patient.  This is what good acting is all about.

I, particularly, would like to have the courage to call such a ""professional exterminator"" like Dr. Jack if I ever had my living conditions degraded to such helpeless and shameful situations, instead of burdening the relatives with an impossible situation to solve.

The movie itself is full of very good perfomances, a solid and fluid screenplay and great cinematography and directing by Barry Levinson. Also, I checked You Tube and was amazed by how the actor playing Jack's lawyer was similar to the real one!

No one ever died with his help who did not want desperately to die, so the question is, do those with a hopeless condition, who are mentally competent, and not being coerced, have a right to die on their own terms or do government and religious agencies have the greater right to decide for them?

He is exceptionally intelligent and yet has little common sense (does he, perhaps, have Asperger's syndrome?). Al Pacino was perfectly cast as Kevorkian and made the character equally serious and funny and completely believable. This movie also includes footage from Kevorkian's consultations, and anybody on the fence about the issue of euthanasia, I suspect, would come down to Kevorkian's side once seeing how these patients are suffering and how badly they want to die and why that is best for them. It's also emotionally gripping. You want to yell at Kevorkian for defending himself in court (a fool for a client as they say) and essentially sabotaging himself, but more than that you want to yell at the court that convicted him. This was a horrible travesty of justice. I am certain Kevorkian will be one of those people universally regarded as a hero-- long after his death.

4115993,5,B003EV6DCG,"There have already been a number of excellent reviews of this movie, which covers Dr. Jack Kevorkian's lengthy struggle on a rather simple goal -- death with dignity for each of us.
 If HBO had not decided to do the movie, I wonder if a Hollywood studio would have done it.

Kevorkian, as expertly played by Al Pacino, lacked some public relations skills, but he did assist many suffering people who just wanted to die rather than continue a life of pain, with lots of tubes into them. The tubes in someone begin the movie and we see more feeding-type tubes through the movie.

The cast is excellent, especially Brenda Viccaro who plays his very helpful sister.
So dedicated that she really did not have her own life. But overall, she seemed to gain strength by assisting her brother in so many ways. Sometimes just by listening to him.

The movie, while dealing with a very serious subject, keeps moving and has slices of some humor and moments when someone just wants to help in the effort.

I would disagree a bit with some reviewers that the issue of death with dignity went to the back page after Kevorkian's experiences with the judicial system.

Remember Sarah Palin's attack on so-called ""death panels"" as Health Care Reform legislation was being put together? A total over-reaction to language that would reimburse doctors for their time counseling relatives about hospice and advance directives, etc.
On the other side, groups like Compassiona nd Choices are working hard and picking up support for end-of-life choices.

It is not an easy process to go  through, for any of us. But the movie shows how death can have dignity and reflect the principles and desires of people approaching the end of their lives. .

The tapes of folks seeking Kivordian's assistance are very revealing. I remember a person approaching dimentia/Alzheimers and knowing it is coming, and struggling to pass away with dignity before all memories blink out.

The movie is well-worth seeing. It will help us all to think, and study up on options

Jack Kervorkian was a very important figure in this raging debate, a doctor by profession he was known more for his work with assisted suicide earning him the title `Doctor Death', he practiced medicide as he liked to call it instead of medicine. Kervorkian dominated the news in the 90's, right up to his incarceration. In ` You don't know Jack' one gets to know many things about the man behind the persona, his zeal and single minded desire to free people of their pain and the reasons behind it. Then there is the person who was jack, his creation of the Mercitron, the machine used for assisted killings, his love of nature, his poor social skills-one of the reasons that he remained unmarried, that he was a lover of Bach and a painter of ghoulish art, his lack of friends and that the only person that cared for his deeply was his sister  Margo (Brenda Vaccaro). Al Pacino delivers an astounding performance and is unrecognizable as Pacino, I thought this was his best performance in the past few years.

However, this movie skilfully narrates the story dealing with it, taking care to not let us run away with our emotions. Al Pacino successfully delivers a great performance, while being clinical about the subject.

The paintings which are exhibited by the protagonist are `ghoulish'. However, there is a marked tenderness about his view that he should assist those who need to `end' their suffering due to terminal illnesses.

(excerpt from the modern Hippocratic Oath)

Barry Levinson's HBO  biopic of Jack Kevorkian, YOU DON'T KNOW JACK (TV-2010) is a surprising film, especially as it got me to reconsider my own views on the right to die controversy. With a ""life at all costs"" mindset, going in I was almost certain that I would find the so-called Doctor Death absolutely repulsive, also that this would be a typical Al Pacino film replete with his usual acting idiosyncrasies. Both proved not to be the case. Instead of just another ""Pacino as..."" movie, Al successfully transforms into Dr. K. in voice, manner, posture and appearance throughout the story.

And what a story it is!
As we ultimately see, the true issue may not be that of a maverick physician who defied God's will on the length of another person's life, but rather one of the individual's right to choose an ending when there is no quality left and nothing in the future but pain, agony and a guaranteed slow and undignified death.

Dr. Kevorkian helped over 130 people end their suffering. He didn't do the job himself, the patient usually began the process him or herself by removing a clip from a pinched-off tube. Three substances were then introduced via an intravenous drip that in succession induced unconsciousness, stopped breathing and paralyzed the heart muscle. The person's passing away is dramatic only as he struggles to breathe while unconscious. The transition from life to death is thus not without some trauma, but it is fairly quick.

The final suicide, and the one that caused the most outrage, was initiated by Kevorkian himself via injections. This entire process was videotaped. His purpose was to get arrested, convicted and to then appeal to the Supreme Court, hoping that a favorable ruling would make assisted sucide legal nationwide. It was an act of desperation because the doctor felt his own life could soon end, and he wanted a resolution that would humanely benefit the terminally ill.

After Kevorkian was interviewed by Mike Wallace and the euthanasia tape aired on 60 MINUTES, he was charged with 1st degree murder and assisting a suicide, which is illegal in Michigan.

Kevorkian's plan backfired. To keep sympathy out of the courtroom, the prosecutor threw out the assisted suicide count and charged him only with murder. Kevorkian wasn't allowed to call surviving family members as witnesses who could testify as to his motivation, and a videotape of the desperately ill man begging for relief was never seen by the jury. The doctor was also his own attorney, in hindsight a fatal mistake.

Jack Kevorkian was convicted and sentenced to 20 years but was paroled after nine, at age 79. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, so he lost that final all-important battle, as well.",1295395200,2,2967,4.861386138613861

I didn't even know who Jack Kevorkian was until this film. I seen this in a nearby Redbox kiosk and had to get it because I love Al Pacino. This movie is over two hours long but worth every second you spend watching it. It really gives you an insight into what this man did and how he helped people escape their terminal illnesses.

4116001,5,B003EV6DCG,"Great actors. Al Pacino is great! The movie should be watched just for his performance. However, what has made the biggest impression on me is Dr. Kevorkian himself (if the film depicts him true to his real self). Very sadly, people with such character as Jack are extremely rare in society - that is people with strong morals, determined, don't give a damn about what others think about them and do not accept the accepted norm if it interferes with their views. The film contains plenty of such examples of his character. Moreover, in history time and time again it's people who are considered heretical, immoral, and despised or persecuted in their time, later on are followed and admired. Some examples of people whose teachings or views were considered dangerous or revolutionary (in the negative way)are: Christ, Galileo, Copernicus, Bonaparte - now are the accepted norm. The main character in ""Crime and Punishment - Rodion Raskolnikov dicusses this particular subject very well. All those people share the same character traits: unshakable belief in their cause; willingness to risk or sacrifice, strength of character (not caring what everybody else thinks or being able to cope with ridicule and criticism).
History shows their rightness or absolves them as the saying goes. It's the society that is not ready for such views and such visionaries are needed to pull the society forward.

4116002,5,B003EV6DCG,"You Don't Know Jack masterfully tells the somewhat unusual, very controversial yet true story of a retired physician, Jack Kevorkian (played to perfection by Al Pacino) who decided to help a new group of patients--those who were clearly terminally ill. Specifically, as you may already know, Kevorkian (aka ""Dr. Death"") wanted to help them end their lives because they (and often their families) did not want their suffering to continue any longer. The film takes a most compassionate look at this highly controversial doctor who helped people commit suicide; and of course your opinion of this film will be positive or negative because of your opinion of euthanasia before you even begin to watch it.

However, even if you're against euthanasia, there's still a lot to learn about this incredibly complicated yet gifted man who was a musician, a man who taught himself Japanese and a painter even if his paintings were not exactly fun to look at. The casting was very well done and the plot moves along very well; I was never once bored and I myself learned a lot about Jack Kevorkian. Look also for a fine performance by John Goodman as Kevorkian's trusted friend Neal Nicol; Susan Sarandon as Hemlock Society activist Janet Good and Danny Huston as Jack's lawyer Geoffrey Fieger--who never charged Jack a nickel! In addition, Brenda Vacarro does a superb job of playing Jack's sister Margo; Jack's relationships with Margo and Janet give us a great opportunity to see how Jack interacted with women when he was quite the bachelor.

The plot is essentially what I have told you already, although there are plenty of true to life plot twists and turns for you to discover as you watch this film. I'm not going to include a lot of spoilers here!

The DVD comes with only one extra entitled ""The Real Jack/Inner Circle;"" but it's quite good as it includes footage with the real Jack Kevorkian, Neal Nicol and Geoffrey Fieger. Al Pacino, Susan Sarandon, Brenda Vacarro and Geoffrey Fieger also speak; but it's just not long enough. The extra runs only ten minutes; and it could have and should have been longer with more footage of Kevorkian and the others.

Overall, You Don't Know Jack remains a controversial film because, of course, not all of us believe in euthanasia. Nevertheless, this film was extremely well made and fans of the actors should get it for their collections. In addition, anyone interested in the issue of euthanasia may also want to get this.",1292284800,5,2464,4.845605700712589

I love Dr. Kevorkian's comment in the DVD extra which was something like, ""He looked more like me than I do!""  Brenda Vaccaro plays Jack's sister Margo who helps Jack, despite Kevorkian's social limitations.  Vaccaro gives an insightful performance, particularly in the scene in the diner where she and Jack have a full-blast argument.  John Goodman who plays Neal, the medical supplier and friend of Jack, gives a subtle performance as even he has to tell Jack the limits.  Susan Sarandon grounds the film with a subtle earthy performance.  Danny Huston's Geoffrey Fieger is a flamboyant character that Huston embodies without reservation.  Although confined to the final frames, Tony-winner Rondi Reed who currently has a reoccurring role on CBS's ""Mike & Molly"" turns in a brilliant performance as the no-nonsense Judge Cooper who will not put up with Kevorkian's antics.  At one point, Pacino's Kevorkian says to her, ""I'm a guest here.""  She replies, ""No, you're the defendant.""  Reed's monologue about justice powerfully concludes and frames the issues of the film.  The DVD extra is well worth a peek.  It is helpful to see the real Kevorkian's sense of humor on display and how Pacino dived into the character.  The issues of assisted suicide and forced suffering still deserve discussion and make this a gritty albeit entertaining film.  Enjoy!",1291939200,,1498,5.081967213114754
4116004,5,B003EV6DCG,".... or rather, I didn't know what to think of Dr Jack Kevorkian, the 'notorious' crusader for the right of 'assisted suicide' in the state of Michigan. Frankly, I didn't pay much attention to his activities in the '80s and '90s. I was living most of the time in Europe. If anything, I had the impression that Kevorkian was a doubtful figure to lead a moral crusade, a person driven by egotism and perhaps monomania. At the same time, I fully agree with his first premise, that a person should have the absolute right, without moral interference from any religious or civic agent, to decide whether to live or die. Any law making suicide a crime is an immoral law that need not be obeyed ... a law of the sort condemned by the Nuremberg Trials, a law that it is criminal to uphold.

The second premise -- that the laws of a country should overtly condone medically assisted suicide or that doctors should be empowered to assist certain sufferers in suicide -- is a far more difficult issue. There are legitimate fears to be acknowledged. Severely handicapped people of my own and my psychologist wife's acquaintance have expressed the fear that, if medically assisted suicide becomes normal and widely accepted, there will be subtle social/societal pressures on them to make that choice, to 'take one for the team' so to speak. There are reasonable fears of economic factors - cost factors - coming into play in a society that has consistently favored for-profit medical care. There are extremely rational fears that Insurance Companies (the very Devil!) will devise ways to squeeze more profit out of their merciless business by finding it cheaper to 'help' their clients die than to keep them alive. If there is a single issue that screams for what John Rawls has called ""overlapping consensus"", assisted suicide is that issue.

Back to Jack, however. This film, with the great actor Al Pacino playing the role of Kevorkian, is unambiguously a portrait of a hero. The 'Jack' in the film is a flawed human being - stubborn, self-righteous, unable to give or take 'love' - but he is a moral hero in the same measure that Nathan Hale, Henry Thoreau, John Brown, Eugene Debs, Robert Lowell, and dozens of Civil Rights demonstrators of the 1960s were, all of whom broke laws, committed overt civil disobedience, and went to jail or the gallows for doing so. But I have a skeptical mind; I seldom 'believe' anything merely on the basis of good acting or plausible writing. I was deeply impressed by the Kevorkian in the film, and by the acting skills of Pacino and the rest of the cast, but honestly, I still don't know Jack.

And I don't need to ""know Jack"" to support, at least provisionally, the concept of medical assistance in end-of-life decisions. Three states of the USA - Oregon, Montana, and Washington - have already passed laws allowing such assistance, as well as the Netherlands. With any luck, I won't need assistance, anywhere, if I should ever need to make such a decision about my own life.",1291593600,2,3004,4.739961759082218

An overreaching goal, most likely the result of Kevorkian's hubris and egomania.

Despite the unfortunately flippant title of this film, Pacino excels in his role, which is enhanced, even further, by the always great John Goodman.  Well-deserving of its Emmy Award and heartily recommended.  Of course, there are some scenes that my be too gruesome for some--so be forewarned.",1291334400,2,604,5.195876288659794

This movie shows how industries and crusades begin with one man challenging the status quo.  Whatever side you choose, the issue forces you to get off the sidelines.

In the end, we know that Dr. Kevorkian served eight years of a 10-25 year sentence.  He was released with a stipulation that he would not engage in any more doctor assisted suicides. Whether Dr. Kevorkian remains muzzled, the seeds of how ideas manifest is portrayed in ""You Don't Know Jack.""

Watch this movie with an apolitical perspective to determine if there is some societal wrong, you wish to right and the process for becoming a change agent.

4116007,5,B003EV6DCG,"This film is good. I remember reading about Jack Kevorkian when growing up, but didn't know all the details. This movie cleared up many things:

1. Kevorkian participated in something like 100 assisted suicides.
2. The thing that got him in trouble was one of the later suicides, in which he made the very unwise choice to kill the patient. So, there was a technical distinction between asssisted suicide and murder.
3. I never knew that he hung himself during his own trial by choosing to defend himself, but this film showed where he messed up and precisely how.
4. The character that came out of the Jack Kevorkian film was someone who was quite quixotic, stubborn, deluded and egotistical.

The role was also something very different for Al Pacino. It seems like I have seen him a time or two too many play a jaded cop or gangster or something.

All in all, this was very much worth the purchase price.",1290297600,2,906,4.580246913580247

STARRING: Al Pacino, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Danny Houston and Brenda Vaccaro

WRITTEN BY: Adam Mazer

DIRECTED BY: Barry Levinson

Rated: Not Rated
Genre: Drama

You Don't Know Jack presents its viewers with a question amidst quintessential questions: should those nearing death and suffering excruciating pain with no chance of hope for a better life, consider assisted suicide? The second question it poses us with is: are the physicians who assist these unfortunate victims, to be held responsible and punished? To these, I add two of my own, stemming from personal religious beliefs: What will happen to the souls of those that choose this as a way to ease their suffering? And will God punish them?

I don't know the answers to these questions, and unlike me, the film's main character Dr. Jack Kevorkian who specializes in assisted suicide, doesn't care. He's not interested in what God thinks, and that's probably because he doesn't believe in him. At one point in the film, he tells a group of religious protesters who ask if he has a god, ""His name is Bach. Johann Sebastian Bach. And at least my god isn't an invented one."" Not a very nice thing to say about God, but this isn't a religious debate. It's a review of a film, and a damn good film at that.

Dr. Kevorkian may not believe in God, but that doesn't make him a bad person. He wishes only to help people with a means to end their suffering. He doesn't do it for attention, or praise, or even financial gain. Strictly pro-bono. When asked if he will charge for his services, his response is, ""You don't charge people for something like this. What's wrong with you?"" Whether you agree with his methods or not, his intentions are the purest of pure. One character in the film defending Jack's integrity, defines him as, ""The most honest man I know. Honest to a fault."" It should be noted that the material is based on a true story but all that I'm reporting to you comes strictly from the film and isn't to be taken as historical fact.

The film simply rides on the story of an elderly man trying to make a change in the world. The conflict comes from those who oppose him, such as the courts, officers of the law, and adamant protesters. What makes the film not only work, but be wickedly entertaining, is a slew of things, to include: the Oscar worthy performance of Al Pacino as Dr. Kevorkian, great supporting performances by Susan Sarandon, Danny Houston and John Goodman, the brilliant direction of Barry Levinson, the well written dialogue, the captivating true story itself, and lastly the unique character of Dr. Kevorkian.

He's a man who enjoys watching cartoons, he doesn't like fatty foods, and in addition to a doctor he is also a musician, a poet, and an exceptional artist. He has a hunchback, he mentions the brilliant writing of Frankenstein, Dr. Kevorkian is an eerie name, his artwork displays grizzly images of death, and he deals in the business of assisting people in suicide; it's all creepy ya see. Throw in his witty dialogue spoken through his mild Fargo-istic accent, and a character is born that any actor of Pacino's caliber would love to play. Few could have given it the divine justice Pacino does, however.

This movie paints an elaborate portrait that assisted suicide is the way to go, and it wants us to root for its main characters. I did. As I mentioned in regards to the notion of: am I for or against assisted suicide - I'm on the fence; and I'm not alone there to say the least. But to close in my own personal opinion: in the light of what God expects from us in a situation like this, I find it blindingly appropriate to say... that we don't KNOW, jack.",1290038400,2,3748,4.614114114114114
4116009,5,B003EV6DCG,"This documentary's story is about how an ""institution"" marks as it's latest prey the right of each individual to decide the manner and conditions of their own demise. The most important and last decision each of us makes is taken from us because it indirectly repudiates the singular source of power that this ""institution"" wields which is FEAR.

To put this latest denial into context I offer a brief critical history (could be longer but the point is made) of this ""institution's"" view of humanity's ordained rights that can be removed:

""Institutional"" sect anointed provocation of conflict to establish for each their own divine control/power over people's minds.
""Institutionalized"" genesis of a racial depiction for Satan and his followers as dark-skinned leading to later supporting the legitimacy of African slavery.
""Institutional"" concept of ""defective"" women leading to witch hunts. Defective meaning poor, mentally ill, sexual and other forms of non-compliance.
The ""institution"" sponsored Crusades goal of the destruction of the heathen which translates to  Jews and Muslims, also including women, the elderly and children.
The ""institution's"" extermination of over 90% of the indigenous Native peoples of Australia, the Americas and many other countries. Regarding them as savages and heathen. These and other cultures (e.g. Asian), thus being considered savage, it was the  duty of this ""institution"" to rid the Earth of such evil.
The ""institutions's"" support of centuries long and geographically dispersed Inquisition that targeted non-believers, the sick, pagans, Protestants, Jews.
""Institution"" decree took away a women's right to govern her own body leaving only the right to be obedient and reproductive.
The ""institution"" doctrine of extinction through repression and homogenization of thousands of what were once rich and diverse cultures and beliefs on this planet.
""Institutional"" decree that the private issue of sexual identity was a self inflicted defective condition or a Satan instituted evil.
""Institutional"" decree that all life on this planet was to be subjugated to and have had dominion over by the  interests of this ""institution"". Consequently environmental degradation and species extinction arise to pay for these benefits. Translation: Glorify unceasing individual wealth as opposed to sharing and restraint for the common benefit of all life.
Sermons that remind us that natural and human made disasters and calamities are this ""institution's"" FEAR personage striking back as a result of the above listed evils. That the horrific death of a child is some vague will/lesson of the ""institution's"" FEAR personage.

4116011,5,B003EV6DCG,"I missed this HBO film on TV so I'm coming to it a bit later than others, but I sat riveted to my TV last night watching the DVD. It was only after watching the 2 hour and 15 minute film (which is so compelling that it seems like 90 minutes) and watched the brief 10 minute bonus ""featurette"" (which includes both the real Kevorkian, his real assistant, and his real attorney) , that I realized that Pacino was channeling the doctor. He sounds the same, has same body frame and has the same speech pattern. (By the way, sadly there are no other ""special features"" included, not even a brief commentary track.

With the subject of assisted suicide, there will always be sides. And - depending on your age, religious beliefs and family medical history you will certainly take sides as you watch this film. But it is based on the actual facts and so I won't give you an outcome of the trial case (though by now you've probably read one of the earlier reviews and  know how the story ends).

Let me just say that Pacino's performance is perfect (not near-perfect, Perfect!) and Susan Sarandon, Brenda Vaccaro and John Goodman are nearly as good. No wonder this won the Emmy for Pacino. You may look at death differently after watching this film, but even if you don't, you'll have experienced one of the top acting performances of the year.

4116012,5,B003EV6DCG,"This is the true story of Dr. Jack Kevorkian (Al Pacino) who, in 1990, challenged the world as he took the end of life debate head-on with his ""Mercy Machine"" and performed his first assisted suicide.  He would continue this discordant activity well over one hundred times and the law was unable to stop him...until he went too far and injected the lethal drugs himself, an act that he dared to show on national television.

Al Pacino delivers what is certainly the finest performance of his career in this HBO feature, completely submerging himself in the role of Dr. Jack Kevorkian.  All of his ""Pacinoisms"" are absent in his portrayal.  His Emmy Award was well deserved.

Directed by Barry Levinson from Adam Mazar's script, the compelling, insightful drama tries to explore the inner mind and personality of ""Dr. Death,"" and it is as successful as any film can probably be in discovering the controversial figure's ""inner demon"".

Interestingly (an wisely), the filmmakers decided to begin this often bleak drama almost as a ""black comedy,"" its first half hour or so exploring the off-the-wall lives of Kevorkian, his sister (Brenda Vaccaro) and his friend (John Goodman), who owns a medical supply business.  It's only after the doctor begins his work in earnest and we get to meet some of his patients that the story becomes more serious and heart wrenching.  One of his later court appearances, however, is quite funny.

In the end, viewers may be more sympathetic to Kevorkian's ""right to die"" message than they are to him, whose downfall was due, in part, to his seemingly massive ego.

Susan Sarandon, as a Kevorkian supporter, Danny Huston, in the role of his flamboyant attorney, and the rest of the cast deliver persuasive performances.

It appears that some of the videos incorporated into the film are of Kevorkian's actual patients.

4116013,5,B003EV6DCG,"YOU DON'T KNOW JACK is an interesting true story. Al Pacino's portrayal of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, America's most famous/infamous advocate of physician-assisted suicide, is nothing short of mesmerizing. The supporting cast members also deliver fine performances. I'm glad I saw it, but I feel compelled to tell you up-front what the film is NOT. It is not a fair presentation of the complex and controversial issue that catapulted Dr. Death into the national spot-light. It is simply an exquisitely executed portrait of Jack Kevorkian - not necessarily who he is (who can judge that), but rather who he thinks he is and how he sees the issue that made him famous.

If you're strongly opposed to assisted-suicide for any reason, I recommend you skip this movie and save yourself some angst.

If you sympathized with Kevorkian during the 90s; or if you get high on exceptionally good performances regardless of subject matter, stop reading this and go watch the movie, you'll love it.

If you don't fall into the categories above, read on:

I chose to overlook the movie's one-sided perspective, but it's pretty blatant. In this film, everyone who opposed Kevorkian's ideas is loosely lumped together as hopelessly narrow-minded and/or religious fanatics. But those characters have little screen time and are so thinly-drawn none of them seem like real people. It's easy enough to rationalize (if you feel inclined) that maybe, for the sake of pure-art, the movie-makers intended these stick-figures only to represent the way Kevorkian views his opponents. I kind of doubt that was the intent, but pretending it was allowed me to overlook what is probably the film's biggest flaw - the glossing-over of an issue that's sticky for more reasons than religious dogma and little-mindedness.

The basic story: Kevorkian, who was an out-of-work pathologist when all this began, gained notoriety from 1990 to1998 when he did significantly more than advocate - he assisted the suicides of approximately 130 people. He was accused of murder (by his opponents) and acquitted several times along the way. (By the way, Danny Hudson is great as Kevorkian's lawyer.) The movie focuses on these years plus the time he was finally convicted and sentenced to prison for a while. In all but the case for which he was convicted, Dr. Kevorkian's ""assistance"" was limited to providing a suitable place, materials (lethal drugs or carbon monoxide), and a method by which the patient could easily SELF-administer the killing agent. The movie includes a few representative cases.

Kevorkian's first assisted-suicide was Janet Atkins, a woman diagnosed (and showing early signs of) Alzheimer's who begged to die before the disease ravaged her mind any further. We know she (and all the others) truly wanted to die, because the doctor's sister (well-played by Brenda Vaccaro) filmed the interviews of all those who sought her brother's unusual services.

I think the movie is a work of art and for this reason alone I give it 5 stars.",1288396800,2,3002,5.0894308943089435

4116016,4,B003EV6DCG,"This docudrama held my interest the whole time.  I've always been interested in Dr. Jack, the first major player in assisted suicide in the USA.  Thus, the drama is all medicine and law related as the action moves from helping critical patients to kill themselves to the doctor's actually ending the patient's life himself.  The latter practice is still illegal in the USA and likely to remain so. Perhaps the best part of this docudrama is our being able to see precisely why it remains illegal as we see Dr. Jack move from medical helper to viewing himself as a God substitute for the abjectly ill.

Al Pacino, as usual, does an absolutely thorough job of covering every nuance of Dr. Jack's character. This is one of those biographical treatments, however, which is very linear and very literal.  It goes from point A to point B to point C very methodically.  Newer and more daring treatments of biographies abandoned this approach for more creative storytelling, such as Bob Fosse's life in ALL THAT JAZZ or indeed Pacino's last stellar HBO effort, ANGELS IN AMERICA. It is this more creative retelling of biographies which I prefer.

Susan Sarandon and John Goodman ably play Dr. Jack's main cohorts in assisted suicide.

4116017,3,B003EV6DCG,"I was super excited about this movie, but I didn't like it nearly as much as I expected to.

The Pros:

+ Al Pacino is perfectly cast as Jack Kervorkian and delivers an amazing performance. Obviously. After all, he is Al Pacino.

+ The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Susan Sarandon as Kevorkian's friend and supporter, Janet Good, and Danny Huston as Jack's outspoken attorney, Geoffrey Fieger.

+ The subject matter is of course very interesting and handled very well. I am not sure if the filmmakers used the original videos made by Kevorkian's patients, but they appeared to be super realistic. The entire film was very emotional and forces viewers to analyze their own morals very closely.

The Cons:

- There's no back-story to this movie at all. It basically opens with Kevorkian deciding to help people die. I was hoping to learn a little bit behind the man known as Dr. Death. Who is he? What was his life like before he started doing this? The movie doesn't go into any of that except to make a point out of saying that people never really got to know Jack. I guess that's the angle they were going for, but it was disappointing. There could have been more information, especially up front.

- I love Susan Sarandon, but what the heck was she doing in this movie?! She didn't have a lot of screen time, and although she played her small part very well, it just seemed beneath her. I thought her appearance in this film was a waste of her talents.

Overall, I recommend watching this movie if you are interested in euthanasia and would like to learn more about Jack Kevorkian, but I'm warning you...you won't learn much more than you already know.",1272499200,11,1667,4.608108108108108
