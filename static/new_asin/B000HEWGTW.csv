2636654,4,B000HEWGTW,"Dust Devil (Richard Stanley, 1992)

Dust Devil got very short shrift when it came out, and the liner notes and director bio place all of the blame for that on Miramax. It's getting to the point where I can't remember ever hearing a good thing about Miramax, and I find myself wondering all too often why any director would consider signing with them. In the case of this film, according to the bio, Stanley (Hardware) made his second film, showed it to Miramax, and had them dump it straight to video with no fanfare. Stanley has got his revenge now with a lavish 4DVD set of the film sure to please those who never got a chance to see it upon its release fifteen years ago.

The story is somewhat confusing, and requires extensive narration to make sense of, but seems to go something like this: Hitch (Good night and Good Luck's Robert John Burke) is a drifter who's not a drifter-- he's actually a vessel for the Dust Devil, a demon who preys on the suicidal, helping them to achieve their goals. The Dust Devil's eventual purpose is to release himself from his Earthly prison. His drifting has led him to Namibia, a hardscrabble desert country just west-northwest of South Africa. He encounters a victim there in the first scene of the movie; the next day, the murder is placed in the lap of Ben Mukurob (Zakes Mokae), one of the local constables. Enter Wendy Richardson (The Unsaid's Chelsea Field), a troubled woman from Pretoria on the run from her disintegrating marriage. Hitch and Wendy meet in the small town of Bethany. Wendy's husband (House of Usher's Rufus Swart) and Mukurob, from opposite directions, track the pair to Bethany, but will they be too late to stop Hitch, and will Wendy care if they do?

The movie's main flaw is its acting. While a good deal of the acting is credible, some even quite good, Swart is just painful to watch, and even the great Zakes Mokae sounds wooden during the first half of the movie. Things get better as he goes along, though. Balanced against this is the look of the film, which is stunning. Stanley once again tabbed Steven Chivers, his cinematographer on Hardware, and the two came up with very good results here. It's not an easy thing to make the desert claustrophobic, but the framing of certain scenes manage it. Indoors, of course, it's easier, but they still went to some pretty amusing lengths to make things even weirder. (Mokae clawing his way through sand to get into an abandoned movie theater is a great, great scene.) While it certainly would have been nice if the movie relied more on action instead of explication to get its point across, it's possible, if not certain, to lay the blame for this at the feet of Miramax's hurried butchering-job that passed for editing (the original movie ran two hours, a cut that's never been seen by the public; Miramax's VHS version ran eighty-seven minutes. The original 107-minute director's cut and a 112-minute work print are included in the four-disc set, which give a much better feel for what the original cut must have been like).

A neglected film that deserves resurrection. Check it out. ***

The White Darkness/Voice of the Moon (Richard Stanley, 2002/1990)

Two of the discs in Richard Stanley's gorgeous recent 4DVD Dust Devil set cover three of his documentaries. One of the discs contains both Voice of the Moon, a short examining life in rural Afghanistan at the time of the Russian withdrawal, and The White Darkness, about the American occupation of Haiti. Both are a rather surprising shift away from the existential horror Stanley explored in his two feature films (Hardware and Dust Devil), though if you think about it, maybe not as much as it would at first seem.

Voice of the Moon, silent save for Simon Boswell's haunting score and narration of bits of poetry, is a documentary of wide open spaces, and, overall, celebration; as the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took power (remember that in 1990, we had no idea what they'd become), Stanley was there to capture the mood of the people of the region, their belief that with a new power structure would come better living conditions. In retrospect, it seems a rather bitter pill to swallow, but whenever there's a regime change, one has to allow for some optimism. The White Darkness, on the other hand, is close, claustrophobic, but no less beautiful for that; rather than being a documentary about voodoo, or about the American occupation (which the documentary itself was instrumental in curtailing, once Stanley's interview with the commander of the Haitian forces was made public), it's the story of the simple lives of some of Haiti's residents, both those who have lived their all their lives and those looking at the Haitian culture with the eyes of outsiders. All the things Stanley could have easily railed against and editorialized about for forty-five minutes come though just as effectively, if not more so, than it if he had done just that. This is a powerful little piece of work, and it deserves a much wider audience than it has so far received. A very nice surprise to find as an extra in this set. ****

The Secret Glory (Richard Stanley, 2001)

The final piece of the extravagant four-disc release of Richard Stanley's film Dust Devil that I got around to watching was The Secret Glory, Stanley's documentary of occult student and Nazi collaborator Otto Rahn. Of the four discs in the set, it's the most recent, and also the weakest.

Much of the problem with The Secret Glory concerns its pace. Simply put, there isn't any-- the movie just plods along. Rahn is an interesting character, but very little of that comes out unless you read pretty far between the lines. The interviewees are wooden, lifeless. The still photos and stock footage aren't that much better. The one thing that truly works here is Stanley's shots of some of his interviewees tracing the paths Rahn must have taken in the last century; they show the beauty of composition that has always been a hallmark of Stanley's works.

Watch the rest of the set first. **",1185926400,,6071,4.721435316336166
2636655,5,B000HEWGTW,"I wanted to see this movie but never got the chance to see it in the theaters. I was very glad to see it released out on DVD that I had to purchase it for myself. All I heard when it was released was you have to see this movie to believe it. I was very happy that I did purchase it. I have no ""experience"" with the director or his other movies. I am the type of person that doesn't really care who directs it or wrote the movie's story. If it a good story, I like it. What I will say about the movie is that it does start out very strange and the story unfolds very odd, but I did like it and it made sense when the movie was finished. It was a very good story I thought and being an ""odd movie"", made it all the more interesting. I am very glad that I did add it to my DVD horror collection. I do highly recommend this movie all to horror fans.",1179792000,3,845,3.7796610169491527
2636656,2,B000HEWGTW,"what flick did these folks watch? I read so many good things about this,but what i saw was an overlong snooze fest.i feel ripped off by the 25 bucks I tossed away,so be damn sure you really want it. the extras are way better than the main feature,i gotta stop now,im getting sleepy just thinking about this thing again.",1173571200,4,319,4.423728813559322
2636657,5,B000HEWGTW,"This release says a lot about the amazing times we live in with regard to the huge variety of re-releases of movies, music, what have you, that have been unfairly buried and never got a chance back in the day to reach the audiences they deserved.  It's heartening that this film is getting a second chance and has received this level of care and treatment.  I enjoyed Stanley's earlier Hardware but didn't think it particularly great and so I never really sought out the earlier versions of Dust Devil; not having seen the truncated previously released edit, I can't directly compare with this new version but I have absolutely no trouble imagining that it was badly butchered. (By the way, this is a much much better movie than Hardware.)

Dust Devil is not in any way a perfectly realized film and Stanley describes himself in a DVD interview various ways where censorship, the budget, shooting schedule problems, and other factors, kept this from being quite what he originally intended, even now with this newly reconstructed 2006 version.  But I give this 5 stars anyway because, for all its shortcomings, this film looks and feels like very few others and such a strong personality goes a long way for me in a time where most films feel completely test marketed to death and bled of all difference and idiosyncracies.  Stanley mentions that he was trying to recreate in the dust devil figure imagery from a dream he had, and I admit to being a sucker personally for any movie that tries obsessively to replicate dream or nightmare logic or feel.  The film studio types who looked at this material and saw a movie that was just not going to connect with the audience they were after and who wound up hacking it to pieces were probably right (unfortunately) about the limited number of people who will appreciate this.  This is not going to appeal broadly to the masses of mainstream horror fans: it is too leisurely paced, too lyrical in tone, too interested in the cultural background of the Namibian/South African location, too interested in exploring the emotional quandry of loneliness and despair that the devil finds in his victims.  And, bluntly put, there's just not enough violent death here to keep the average bloodthirsty genre fan happy I expect, and some of the horror make up/effects are also a bit substandard.  But for any horror devotees who gravitate to more personal and unusual films without needing a high body count (and who understand how a slower pace can work in your favor), you should absolutely watch this (especially if you are also an italian western fan, the aesthetic of which informs this film).  Stanley has a fantastic eye and the film is a real visual stunner with many shots that stay in your head long after: genre fans who truly appreciate attention to framing, lighting, and camera moves should respond to Stanley's great work here.

Hopefully, the rediscovery of this film will help to give Stanley a shot at another big narrative film soon and hopefully, he gets the chance to do it as he wants this time.",1169942400,2,3053,4.763257575757576
2636658,5,B000HEWGTW,"The film making career of director Richard Stanley has to be one of the Film Industry's most wasted opportunities. Why hasn't this talented director made more films? His two complete films Dust Devil and Hardware are both visions of uniqueness and originality. It is both the Industry and the Film Goer who have lost out big time to the fact that Stanley has only made these two films and was ignominiously fired from a third - the most recent remake of The Island Of Dr Moreau.

Dust Devil was originally released in a severely edited version by its producers and distributors and with no marketing to speak of, quickly left cinemas and went straight onto video. Stanley has restored an approximately 20 mins of footage and the running time of the film is now 108 mins. The restoration is crucial because the initial release saw all the supernatural elements of the film removed, so as to make it a pure serial killer type film. Fully restored to a version as close to Stanley's original vision as is possible, given the passage of time, Dust Devil can finally take its long overdue accolade as a great film in its own right, within the genre of Horror film making.

Set in Namibia, at the time of that country's independence from South Africa, Dust Devil follows the exploits of a murderous, hitchhiking nomad (played by Robert John Burke) who after butchering and dismembering his victims, retains their fingers. This nomad subsequently is revealed to be more than human, and in fact is a 'Dust Devil' from African folklore - a shape shifting demon who preys on the lonely, despondent and vulnerable, and collects their souls to buy his way into an afterlife.

A depressed housewife (well played by Chelsea Field) flees her husband in South Africa and drives into Namibia's desolate badlands, hoping to lose herself in this bleak but beautiful wilderness. However, she is drawn to the Dust Devil and soon finds that there are far worse things than depression and failed marriage to have to cope with.

Hunting this killer, is an ageing South African policeman, superbly played by Zakes Mokae (The Serpent And The Rainbow, A Dry White Season). Before long this policeman learns the nature of his quarry and living somewhat on the edge himself, following the death of his wife and child, realises that he too is a potential victim.

The films narrator is John Matshikiza who plays a Namibian shaman. He it is who advised Mokae's policeman as to the nature of the quarry that he is attempting to hunt down...

Boasting a stupendous score by Simon Boswell, the film is also visually stunning with its Namibian desert locations and real life ghost towns.

All the cast acquit themselves well as the story with its theme of desolation plays out to its grim conclusion. The walls separating reality and otherworldliness are blurred in this film, and the visions experienced by the film's principals seem to meld into real life. Destitute individuals, dying towns, and a barren and stunningly beautiful landscape combine to give a visual feast of a film which lingers long in the memory after having been viewed.

This is a five disc DVD and apart from the main version of the film, there is 115 min rough cut that features sequences that Stanley considered too far gone to actually include in this final cut of the film. Well worth a look though.

Additionally there are two documentaries on another two of these DVDs. one is The Voice Of The Moon which is Stanley's documentary that he filmed while in Afghanistan with the Mujahadin rebels during the 1980s.

The other documentary is The Secret Glory which again made by Stanley, features the story of the quest of Otto Rahn (an SS officer) to locate the Holy Grail.

The last disc though is Simon Boswell's full and magnificent score for Dust Devil.

The main disc of the film though is in 5.1 sound which coupled with these extra DVDs and CD, makes this Region 1 release by far the superior version to go for as compared to the Region 2 DVD which is a single disc and in surround sound only (why?).

For Stanley fans this is an incredible opportunity to see Dust Devil almost fully restored and at last in a format that it deserves. Newcomers to Richard Stanley's work are also strongly recommended to use this set as a starting point in viewing this outrageously underrated director's work. Thankfully though, Stanley is starting to get the recognition that is so long overdue for him, and we may see him make another film in the near future at long last too.",1169164800,,4509,4.728662420382165
2636659,5,B000HEWGTW,"Imagine Sergio Leone, Dario Argento and Michaelangeo Antonioni working on a feature film together, and you'd end up with ""Dust Devil.""  This movie is part western, part horror film, part existential exploration.

The remarkable thing is, the director, Richard Stanley, pulls this unique mix off!  Despite many hardships in the making of the film!  His loss of money, and production problems, meant less gory effects, less splashy action sequences--accidents which enormously benefitted the ""final"" version.

Stumbling across this thick box in a bookstore (of all places), I was intrigued by the five disk set. It including three documentaries, the ""final"" version of a feature, and the ""workprint.""  I had seen ""Hardware"", the first feature by Richard Stanley, and thought it was okay--not great, but entertaining.

I just finished watching the feature.  It utilizes brilliantly the haunting, desolate landscape of Namibia.  The storyline has been summarized in other reviews.  It is a fascinating mix of horror film, suspense film, but mostly it feels like an art film about desolation and loneliness, an existential exploration of our relationships.  There is the broken relationship between the lead female across, who at the beginning of the film leaves her husband (who abuses her).  There is the relationship between the Black detective and his white counterparts, containing nicely understated racial tension.  There is the relationship, also, between white and Blacks.  Topping it off is the relationship between magic and reality.  For that matter, there is the relationship between the ""dust devil"" himself, who is not what he first seems, and his victims.

I've watched the extended documentary about Otto Rahn, who was recruited into the SS because Himmler thought Rahn had a bead on the Holy Grail--fascinating!  I have not yet seen the other documentaries.  However, I watched the interviews conducted with Richard Stanley about both the Holy Grail documentary and on making ""Dust Devil""--both were fascinating interviews in their own right.

This DVD set is an excellent deal!

By the way, the video and audio quality are Criterion level.",1169078400,2,2153,5.370149253731343
2636660,4,B000HEWGTW,"This is a visually gorgeous film. I watched it expecting a horror movie but ended up enthralled by its sheer visual splendour; both in its stunning photography and its breathtaking landscape. As a horror film, I doubt if it would attract the mass of today's horror fans. It's obvious why the studio quietly dumped it onto video without a theatrical release. It would not have sold as a horror movie. There are not enough shocks, gore or horror to satiate today's audience. The predominant feeling I got was not so much of fear, but of despair, desolation and spiritual isolation, made all the more stark when set amidst all that beauty. I would agree with director Richard Stanley, when he says that it is closer to an ""art film"" than a horror movie.

Stanley grew up in South Africa and learned the folklore of the natives at the feet of his mother, an anthropologist who collected stories and folktales of the African tribes. This story revolves around a shape-shifting spirit, variously called a Soupwah, a Num or in Afrikaans, a Nagtloper (literally Night-Runner). The Nagtloper (Robert John Burke) feeds off the life-force of the damned - people who have lost the will to live. Into his orbit float two lost souls, Wendy (Chelsea Field) a South African woman fleeing from a failed marriage and Ben Mukurob (Zakes Mokae), a Zulu policeman whose life came to an end years ago with the death of his wife. Who will attain deliverance? The white woman, the black policeman or the Nagtloper, whose own aim is to return to the spirit world from where it came. The desolate emptiness of the Namib is beautifully captured. Scenes are exquisitely choreographed, almost like a ballet. I don't know if I would recommend it to the usual horror film fan, but it is definitely one for cinephiles. The DVD is superbly produced with crystal clear image quality, no dirt, no damage and with exceptionally good sound. It is presented in its original 1.85:1 widescreen. Strangely there are no subtitles. The main feature is anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen TV) as are all of Stanley's interview segments. Sadly none of the other Extras are anamorphic. Even the workprint is letterboxed.

This Special Edition comes with a host of Extras spread over 5 discs. Personally I felt that devoting an entire disc to the ""Workprint"" was overkill. But I'm not complaining. You can watch the workprint in its entirety or just use the 46 chapter-stops to get directly to the various deleted segments, which are sadly all taken from a VHS source; some having no sound, some looking really terrible, and most having the video-counter running above or below the print. I would recommend the workprint only to ardent admirers of the Final Cut. The other Extras have nothing to do with the main film itself but are Stanley's TV documentaries on other subjects. Nonetheless, they are definitely worth viewing.

The most substantial Extra is ""The Secret Glory of SS Obersturmfuhrer Otto Rahn"" made for Britain's Channel Four TV. This is a 97min documentary on the life of the Nazi poet and writer Otto Rahn who was obsessed with the search for the ""Holy Grail"". This is not the Grail of Christ which we usually associate with the legendary quest but a more obscure ""Grail"" supposedly made from the crown of Lucifer, variously described as a stone, a gem or a diadem. Stanley contends that Rahn and the Nazis did find the Grail in southern France but gives no source for his claim. To be fair, the documentary is not about the search for the Grail itself but is an account of Rahn's tragic life. The sad irony of his life is that this Nazi stalwart, who wrote so many vile tracts condemning the Jews, was in the end, himself revealed to be a Jew. The documentary is very dense, and expects the viewer to be fully conversant with Grail legend, 13th Century Crusader history (specifically of the Albigensian or Cathar Crusade) and German history circa WWII. Like Rahn, Stanley doesn't make clear when he conflates fact and fiction. The Lucifer Grail is referred to in Wolfram von Eschenbach's medieval poem Parzival (the source of Wagner's Parsifal). This is by almost all accounts an invention based on the old Arthurian legends. Rahn ties that in to historical fact by assuming that the Grail mountain, the fictional Montsalvat of the poem, is the same as Montsegur, the last retreat of the Cathars in southern France. The Cathars were Gnostic Christians, declared heretics by the Vatican, which sent in Crusaders to annihilate them in what became known as the Albigensian Crusade. The hilltop fortress of Montsegur was where the Cathars made their last stand. At Montsegur Rahn searches and apparently finds the Grail he is looking for. In fact, the Cathars never claimed to possess the Holy Grail. The documentary is packed with so much information, both historical fact and literary fantasy, that it requires more than one viewing for full assimilation and it is not easy to sit through. Picture quality is mediocre but tolerable for a documentary extra. It is in 1.85:1 widescreen, letterboxed into a 4x3 fullframe. Sound quality is very poor. Dialogue is recorded at fluctuating volume levels, is frequently inaudible and in many instances drowned out by extremely boomy bass. Worse, the sound and picture for the interviews are never in sync. The film's temp-track sounds terrible (like a bad B-grade horror flick) but the accompanying Wagnerian music is grand and transcendent. The exerpts come from Wagner's Parsifal and Tannhauser. The documentary interviews are in equal parts German, French and English. The entire documentary comes with obligatory English subtitles. To be fair, Stanley admits that this is just a preview of a work in progress which he hopes to release in proper form one day.

My favourite of the documentaries is the 36min long ""Voice of the Moon"". It is a visual record of Stanley's visit to Afghanistan towards the end of the Soviet occupation (1989). As Stanley points out in the interview, it is more akin to poetry than a documentary; a visual tone-poem if you will. The sparse narration, in verse form, occurs only at the beginning and end and is given wholly in Pashto (Pashtun language). English subtitles are burnt onto the print. This was made for Britain's BSB channel. As a traditional factual documentary it falls flat, but as a visual poem it is beautiful. And this is evident despite the poor quality of the 16mm film footage. It was shot on a mechanical (spring driven/hand-cranked) Bolex camera, with no sync-audio. The reason was because they were travelling with the mujahideen and shooting for months in places where there was no electricity; mostly around the Afghan/Pakistan border region in the majestic Hindu Kush mountains. Stanley's 1/2-hour long interview accompanying this film is a must-see. He describes the Afghan expedition, his meetings with the Afghan mujahideen, his deep admiration for them and his sadness at seeing them bombed into oblivion post-9/11. The film itself ends with the mujahideen victorious in the final battle for Jalalabad. The music score is lyrical and evocative and is easily the loveliest score written by Simon Boswell on these discs. It is inspired by Eastern European folk music (not native Afghan music) and the documentary also features the Trio Bulgarka singing ""Oi Yano Yanke"" from their ""The Forest is Crying"" album.

""The White Darkness"" is a documentary Stanley made for the BBC as part of a series on world religions. Its focus is on the practise of Voodoo on the island of Haiti. Coincidentally, while the documentary was being shot, America invaded the island. The documentary ends up being an examination of Voodoo practise on the one hand, and a record of the American invasion on the other. Thanks to a particularly obnoxious US Army Colonel, it also becomes a story about superior American Evangelical Christianity coming in to trounce the devil-worshipping heathens of the island. The Colonel is so boastfully arrogant and self-righteous that one could only sigh with relief to learn that he was eventually ""removed from command"". Visually this film looks the best of the three and is presented in its original 1.33:1 fullscreen with good audio quality. Most of the documentary is in English with the French and Creole segments suitably subtitled. It also comes with a 17min long interview where, amongst other things, Stanley describes the American invasion and the surreal image of US Marines and ""Armed Baptists"" coming to evangelise the heathens.

The last disc of this 5-disc set is an audio-CD containing the soundtrack of ""Dust Devil"". I wish they had included the soundtrack of ""Voice of the Moon"" as well. It is probably the best thing Simon Boswell has written. The set is accompanied by three separate 12-page booklets, the first being a very detailed and informative production diary on ""Dust Devil"", the second containing equally detailed discussions on the 3 documentaries, and the third being a comic-book version of the film. The ""Dust Devil"" feature alone is worth the asking price for this release. Coupled with all the extras, this DVD is self-recommending.

Note: As we are reminded on every disc here, Richard Stanley is the Great-Grandson of the legendary explorer and adventurer, Sir Henry Stanley, who gave his name to the Stanley Falls (now Boyoma Falls, DRC), and the city of Stanleyville (present day Kisangani, DRC), searched for and rescued his even more famous fellow-explorer, David Livingston and is credited with the iconic line, ""Dr. Livingston, I presume?""",1161648000,23,9565,4.978111319574734
2636661,5,B000HEWGTW,"I've been waiting for this movie to hit DVD for a long time.  I endured the butchered VHS release.  Then I bought the uncut bootleg on VHS, but the quality was so bad, it was hard to sit through.  Finally, DUST DEVIL is here on DVD, in Richard Stanley's approved cut, and in gorgeous picture quality.  The movie was made 20 years ago and it is only now getting a proper release.  YES, it was worth the wait!

The film is 16x9 and perfectly encoded for this DVD release.  The colors are vibrant and the sound is amazing.

This has got to be one of the most underrated films in horror movie history.  Smart, stylish, and inventive, DUST DEVIL is an amazing accomplishment.  It's even more impressive that director Richard Stanley was only 24 years old when he directed this classic!

THANK YOU Subversive Cinema, for giving this movie a spectacular release.  The movie looks excellent and the bonus features are very informative.  Going way above and beyond, Subversive has unleashed DUST DEVIL in a FIVE DISC package!

It is only in the bonus discs that I see anything negative about this release.  One of the DVD's is the entire ""workprint"" of DUST DEVIL.  This is supposed to give us some added layers, bits, and pieces that are not in the ""Final Cut"" (Richard Stanley's approved version, on the first disc).  Personally, I did not find this workprint DVD all that interesting.  There was not much additional on this workprint version compared to the Final Cut on disc one.  I would have been content with a brief ""deleted scenes"" bonus feature on the main disc, instead of a whole DVD devoted to this longer, unfinished version.

Another bonus disc is a feature length Richard Stanley documentary about a member of the SS who searched for the Holy Grail.  This is a fascinating topic, and the details in the documentary are very interesting.  But the documentary is so poorly put together, it is actually hard to sit through.  Stanley himself admits the doc is a ""work in progress""  ...but the post-production of this film is so amateur and flawed, it should have never been released to the public.

Another bonus disc contains two short Stanley documentaries.  Voice Of The Moon is, again, interesting ... and very well shot... but the post-production technical flaws render this doc equally unwatchable.  On the same disc is a second short documentary called White Darkness.  This is the only one of the three documentaries in this set that was properly and professionally completed.  However, Subversive Cinema did a very poor job on the encoding of this program, somewhat ruining an otherwise welcome bonus program in the set.

The fifth disc is not a DVD at all.  It is an audio CD - the excellent music score to DUST DEVIL.  This soundtrack CD is a very nice addition to this release.

In short, when it comes to the bonus features, I would have preferred to simply have three discs... One with the movie, one with the soundtrack, and one with the White Darkness documentary (properly encoded).  While the other bonus features are lacking, we don't seem to be paying anything extra for them, so I won't deduct stars for them.

DUST DEVIL is a fantastic film, and its proper release is long overdue.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1161043200,7,3236,4.705882352941177

Five DVDs, two cuts of Dust Devil and three other Stanley documentaries, including the one for which I would have paid five times the price on its own: The Secret Glory, the incredible true story of SS Officer Otto Rahn's quest to locate the Holy Grail for the Nazis. As I understand it, The Secret Glory is the best source of information about this fascinating but neglected historical figure who, if he had lived, would be in a position to sue both Dan Brown AND the authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail for intellectual property theft. They're safe, however, as Rahn either committed suicide or was executed by the Nazis after writing a letter asking to be released from the SS. ""I am very worried about my country,"" he said in another letter, ""...It is impossible for a tolerant, generous man like myself to live in a country such as what my beautiful fatherland has become.""

2636674,4,B000HEWGTW,"Given his obvious talent, it's difficult to see why Richard Stanly hasn't made more feature films. He's got a couple in the works now and I hope they're huge. I'd love to see what else he has up his sleeve.

Here's the scoop. Set in South Africa during Apartheid, the police in general and one detective in particular (Zakes Mokae) think they're on the trail of a serial killer. Little do they know it's actually a demon they're after who preys on those who are in despair and have lost hope. Those who are already dead but have yet to die. A young woman, Wendy, is on the outs with her husband and is running, but she has nowhere to run to when she picks up said demon as a hitch hiker. The two have an interesting time together, but it's time he finishes the job.

Stanley released ""Hardware"" in 1990 and this in 1992. Neither would be considered a great movie, but each is so interesting in its approach, and so deftly directed, it hurts that he doesn't work more. Like ""Hardware,"" ""Dust Devil"" has an abundance of heat and desert. Both are infused with an orange/red glow and both have a young woman in peril from a malevolent force. Both women must rely on themselves and not men to save themselves from the situation. In ""Hardware"" the society is broken down through nuclear war. Here, society is in turmoil as the blacks begin breaking away from their European oppressors. Both societies are in danger of dissolving. As Stanley is South African, this socio-political subtext to the story might read better to South Africans than to others but it's an interesting approach nonetheless. Chelsea Field and Robert Burke give solid performances as the centerpieces. Zakes Mokae is a veteran who has been good in every movie I've seen him in. He doesn't disappoint here.

This movie looks good and is directed well. There are no cheap thrills here (well....maybe a couple) but overall it's an adult outing. I doubt someone raised on today's horror or slasher flicks would have the patience to sit through this. If you need a bit more meat on your bones or more grey in your matter this should do you well.",1322697600,2,2106,4.5809018567639255
2636675,5,B000HEWGTW,"I fell hopelessly in love with this movie when I saw the scene with aboriginal magical blood drawings decorating the walls of the victim's room like some dimly lit cave at Lascaux. The director's extensive knowledge of South African anthropology and magic make this film an absolute jewel. His commentary and interview is a fascinating barrage of intriguing facts and tales of adventure while filming on location in Namibia.

The sets are great...very atmospheric, and the photography is incredibly beautiful; the surreal locations of sand dunes and endless highway of Namibia are definitely an asset.  The sound track is also great.

This is more than a horror movie...there is so much info about African magical beliefs, especially if you listen to the commentary and interview, that it would enthrall an anthropologist as well.",1304640000,,830,5.225563909774436

2636678,1,B000HEWGTW,"What a terrible movie!  108 minutes of my life I will never get back again!  It's easy to see why this never got any theatrical release - it would have been laughed out of theaters.  Why anyone would waste their time on a 5-disk set of this boring, long, empty movie is beyond my understanding.  I guess sometimes style wins over substance, but in this case there was no style to redeem the movie, either.  I think the shots of Chelsea Field wandering in the desert were actually reality shots - of her trying to escape the set, and get off the movie!

Beware - unless this is the first horror/thriller movie you've ever seen, unless you have never seen even a half-way decent movie before, you will be bored to death.  Avoid, at all costs.",1255651200,4,740,4.397058823529412

Part Scientist, part Occultist and in no way prepared for the Politics of dealing with an Organization he can never possibly understand or comply with . He finds himself being offered the oppurtunity and financial support he never would have had on his own but with perilous strings attached . Worth buying just to get this disc .

2636680,5,B000HEWGTW,"A wayward, shape-shifting demon (Robert John Burke) does what he must to escape our material plane. What does this require? Why, serial-murder of course! Not just any kind of killing however. No, The Dust Devil must use his victims in archane rituals, where blood-letting (along w/ other body fluids) has dark, secret power. To him, we are fleshly keys to help him unlock a portal to the spiritual realm. Enter Wendy (Chelsea Field), a woman who is also trying to escape something. In her case, it's her marriage, and the abuse that came w/ it. Her path will intersect with the Dust Devil's trajectory in the Namibian town of Bethany. Meanwhile, a cop named Ben (Zakes Mokae) is trying his best to do two things. One is to track down the infamous serial-killer, the other is to endure life without his long lost wife and son. These three beings- the demon, the woman, the man  -will meet in a desert ghost-town in order to fulfill their destinies. DUST DEVIL is an outrageously overlooked horror masterpiece. I never tire of watching it, and highly recommend it. Richard Stanley (Hardware) has come up with a truly original and engrossing tale of life, death, and the supernatural, all played out in the barren African wastes left by generations of war. The landscape is captured beautifully, making Africa seem more like the planet Mars than any earthly environment. DUST DEVIL should be owned by all horror maniacs! This one is in my top five...",1208736000,2,1447,4.788

The visuals and sounds are magnificent and give the film a unique feel. There is NO other film like this. All it takes is a few frames of the film to realize you are watching Dust Devil. I randomly saw this on TV while I was in the Philippines, and I was hooked. I purchased this DVD as soon as I found out there WAS a DVD! If you like horror, westerns, monster movies, and/or great movies, you owe it to yourself to see this flick!",1200528000,,563,4.174311926605505
2636682,5,B000HEWGTW,"This was recommended to me by my good friend and Amazon bud, Clint Bronson.  He thought I would like it since I like horror movies with serial killers and (since I am a photographer), the beautiful cinematography.  HE DID NOT STEER ME WRONG!  This is by far one of the most visually perfect horror movies I ever saw.

The movie takes place in the wilds of South Africa.  An American drifter and serial killer (Robert John Burke) takes to South Africa.  He roams the desert, taking photos of his victims before he kills them in a ritualistic way. The first one he makes beautiful love to (and he, Dust Devil is quite handsome) and then snaps her neck. He then dismembers her and paints pictures on the wall with her blood and other products added to it, and simply moves on to the next victim.  In the mean time, a unhappy housewife, Wendy (Chelsea Field), decides to leave her husband and find herself in the South African desert.  She meets Dust Devil when she picks him up hitchhiking.  Their paths cross a few times, she is taken in by him, but then finds out what he does.  The rest is a journey to find just who or what Dust Devil is.

I found the cinematography to be visually perfect.  Yes, this movie had gore,but was so well put together, directed and photographed that I really didn't see it as that gory.  I saw it as a beautiful film.

I highly recommend this to any horror fans or fans that love excellent cinematography.  This movie held my interest and definitely is one of the better horror films of modern times.

Also thanks M. for having it on your wish list, Clint might not have seen it.  And Main Man thanks for reinforcing me to watch this!  Again, my Amazon friends have not steered me wrong.  BUY THIS MOVIE!",1193616000,,1733,4.410094637223975

bro. M!  He had it on his wish list.  I remember
the cover art and saying..hmmmm.  That's interesting!
I watched it for the first time last week and how
this JEWEL got passed me for so many years I will
never know?  Robert Burke plays The Serial killer
Dust Devil.  He is a loner through the sands of time
and space.  Chelsea Field(moochie-moochie) is a runaway
housewife who keeps encountering demonic serial Burke.
I was really expecting a artsy but boring film.  In
no way is this boring!!!  You have skeletal faces,GORE,
Chelsea Field,GORE, severed hands,GORE,visually imaginative
GORE,head explodings,Chelsea Field and GORE!!!!
This is a serious HORROR film and worth owning.
There is nothing boring!!!  I do not understand
how anyone can say that it is????????  In the first
5 min. you have Burke and some girl getting it on
fully nude and ""SNAP"" goes her neck. Next the Big
Bowie knife comes out and ""SLIPTZZZERRUUUP"" off goes
a hand!!!  The house than gets a paint job from the
severed hand!!!!  It's only been five minutes folks!

8139282,3,B000HEWGTW,"I don't really get Richard Stanley's cult following, but I will say ""Dust Devil"" is a bigger, better movie than his first, the no-budget sci-fi B ""Hardware."" Still, I don't see a lot of originality here, let alone his rep as a mad genius. This is basically just another killer hitchhiker movie, gussied up with a lot of psychedelic folderol (think Nicholas Roeg), some Spaghetti Western gestures (think Jodorowsky), some magical-mystical blarney (think Aleister Crowley's groupies), and some unnecessarily revolting gore. Despite the bigger budget, it often feels like another B movie, and does that B movie thing of being pretty slow and boring during the quiet stretches that separate the revoltingly gory scenes. Not bad as horror films go, but I don't think it lives up to its pretentious aspirations or its hype. After this he started on ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" which was taken away from him, as seen in the documentary ""Lost Soul.""",1437523200,2,941,5.0

8139284,5,B000HEWGTW,"If ever a movie suffered through production hell and studio interference, it was Stanley's Dust Devil.  Brilliantly filmed in Namibia and South Africa, many of the landscape shots are truly breathtaking, the resulting film was edited by studio forces in such a way as to remove all menace, coherence and soul.  But this edition is everything restored, the final director's cut.  Stanley is as much a visionary as a director, much in the way of Terry Gilliam, a trait that often brings production headaches that studio suits disdain.  Immersed in myth (the central figure embodies the nameless, drifting stranger acting outside of social expectations) and local, mystical beliefs, Stanley weaves a chilling tale much deeper than the base acting on the screen.  The Devil preys on persons who have given up on life- he can ""smell"" it, is drawn to it- and he acts in a dimension of sorts that defies concepts of time or reality.  It is a film that demands thinking, demands work on the part of the viewer, and is all the more satisfying for it.",1399248000,4,1041,4.787709497206704
8139285,3,B000HEWGTW,"When you label something ""limited collector's edition"" people expect extras, commentary etc. Unfortunately the box doesn't come close. The box consits of 5 discs - 1 Final Cut, 1 Workprint, 1 Sountrack and 2 DVDs with short movies with no relation to Dust Devil whatsoever (maybe except for the short voodoo documentary).

The good: The Final Cut DVD is execellent quality and the movie is superb. The Soundtrack CD is also excellent.

The bad: There is no real behind the scenes or production documentary, no director's commentary specials, etc. Also there are additional short movies/documetaries by Richard Stanley in terribly bad and unbearable VHS quality:
-""Secret Glory"" (some obsure holy grail documentary about a nazi Germany guy supposedly hunting for archeological artfacts)
-""White Darkess"" (a short 30min. documentary about voodoo in Haiti, pretty boring with no real facts)
-""Voice of the Moon"" (a documentary about the Russians invading Afghanistan, didn't watch it, but I expect it to be as boring and useless piece of garbage as the previous two)

The ugly: The Workprint DVD consists of DVD and lots of VHS material put together in very poor quality. This doesn't seem to be the original workprint off the celluloid movie reel.

The box delivers a nice final cut of the movie and the superb soundtrack - if this is enough for you you won't be diappointed. But if you are expecting a really nice collectors edition with extras you will be pretty much furious.",1389052800,3,1476,5.036885245901639

8139287,5,B000HEWGTW,"A dark shadow hangs over the African desert, and in its wake lies a trail of bodies. He is the Dust Devil, and he rides on the winds collecting the souls of the desperate and weak of heart. As he sets off across the desert to collect his latest victim, he is followed by a persistent policeman whose fifteen year pursuit will finally draw him into a final confrontation with the devil! DUST DEVIL is Richard Stanley's magnum opus, a film that is simply too good for the Horror genre. Stanley is a supreme visualist, who is able to tell a captivating story through images, alone. His impeccable style mesmerizes the audience in DUST DEVIL, as each shot has been planned out to perfection. The African landscape comes to life in ways that many people never thought imaginable, to the point where it becomes a surreal painting. In its extended cut, Stanley achieves all of the same abstract mysticism and dreamy suspense as Alejandro Jodorowsky or David Lynch ever have. The film is otherwise beyond compare. Robert Burke plays a powerful villain, often losing himself in the character. He is charming and mysterious, easily winning the affection of his intended victims in their final moment of weakness. With stunning cinematography and a gripping story, DUST DEVIL is essential viewing for all Horror fans!
