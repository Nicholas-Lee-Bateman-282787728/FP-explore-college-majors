1007293,5,6305248893,"I loved this film--it's my new favorite film and nobody has it in stock that I know of except Block buster Video! It should have gotten alot more coverage because it's so far from the reguritated, hackneyed junk Hollywood  keeps feeding us. I thought it was very clever and oh so funny!",948067200,,286,4.5
1007294,5,6305248893,"I won't try to detail the plot of this movie because that might spoil it.  I'll just say that it has enough surprises and turns to work.  But what makes this movie shine is the characters, especially Georgie played to  perfection by Kate Beckinsale.  By now it's getting difficult to praise Ms.  Beckinsale's performances without repeating myself because she is always so  excellent in every role.  Her Georgie is wonderful and she hits every note  exactly.  Her character is the central point of a three part comedy about  con men and love.  I know it may sound strange but you must see this movie.  Very funny!  Hilarious!  This is the kind of film the English can do so  well and I hope they keep sending them to us.  Especially with Kate  Beckinsale in them.  We don't see enough of her on this side of the  Atlantic. Buy this DVD and enjoy a great comedy (in widescreen!) that you  can share with your friends.  They'll thank you.",923184000,5,935,4.5120481927710845
1007295,5,6305248893,"Two fun-loving seemingly selfish con-artists hire a gorgeous young girl  (Kate Bekinsale) as their assistant.  Only one problem, she is an honest  person and wasn't informed of their dishonest exploits. This film is  hysterical, romantic and tugs at your heartstrings.  Filmed beautifully in  England's countryside and ""Hard Days Night"" like scenes in  London.  This film is an grand romp and I highly recommend it to anyone who  wants a laugh",917049600,,443,5.214285714285714
1007296,5,6305248893,"For anyone who just wants to kick back and enjoy a really off-beat and quirky British film, this is the one.  Kate Beckinsale is at her best here, and the rest of the cast rises to the occasion!",915321600,,194,4.105263157894737
1007360,2,6305248893,"...I wasn't really satified with it. The plot was just ridiculous, it seems like someone just rushed the script or a high school student wrote it; that's how pathetic the script is. If you're wandering what I'm talking about, just go rent or buy the dvd or the vhs; and you'll see what I mean. I'm the type of fella who likes ""smart comedies"" and this film is absolutely ""not smart"" (for the lack of a better term), so I ended up not liking it. Althogh, I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale so I'm somewhat satisfied to add this DVD in my collection; that's pretty much the reason why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 as the rate. ...",1027036800,2,622,4.10655737704918
1007361,4,6305248893,"i picked this movie up because when i glanced at the cover it had three actors i just adore....and when i watched it i was charmed by the characters...most especially Stuart Townsend's Jez...the developing attraction between Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) and Jez is adorable to watch...and the end, although a bit cheesey, is a feel good happy ending....there is enough wit and quiet humor in this movie to keep you watching...",1016755200,5,423,5.057142857142857
1007362,3,6305248893,"Take a couple of con men who see an opportunity to separate a mark from his money in just about everything, throw in an attractive young woman with an altruistic agenda, blend together for about ninety-three minutes and the result is ""Shooting Fish,"" an amiable, entertaining comedy, directed by Stefan Schwartz.  It's the story of two guys who grew up in orphanages on opposite sides of the ocean, Dylan (Dan Futterman) in America, Jez (Stuart Townsend) in England; and who, by the time they had reached the age of consent, had each been endowed with a particular talent: Dylan has the gift of gab, Jez is a technical wizard.  Dylan's gift has quickly gotten him into hot water with the wrong kind of people, however, and to stay healthy (read:  ""Alive"") he flees to England, where he meets Jez.  And it's a friendship/partnership born in scam/scheme heaven.  If there's a way to make a fast buck, they know it-- from selling bogus computers, to selling insulation for homes that's never installed, to entering any and every contest that comes down the pike.  If there's a nickel in it, they're in.
 Then one day they hire a girl from the temp pool to help them out with one of their scams.  Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is beautiful, smart, and has a cause she's trying to fund, so she needs the job; but from day one she's on to what Dylan and Jez are trying to pull.  She stays on board, however, when Dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day Robin Hoods-- that the money they're ""raising"" is going to orphans.  What he doesn't tell her is that the ""orphans"" he's referring to is them.  And Dylan is a born salesman-- not to mention the fact that he's a real charmer-- and the three of them become a real team.
 Schwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable, but it is entertaining.  It's exactly what it promises to be:  a diverting hour and a half or so that provides some laughs and a good time.  It's pleasant fare that's inoffensive and features some engaging performances and a story that will keep you involved.  There are a couple of scenes, in fact, that are downright hilarious.  And Schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along, which, when you add it all up, makes for a satisfying, enjoyable experience.
 Futterman has a winning personality and a resonant, mesmerizing voice that fits his character perfectly.  Dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet, because if you do, chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge.  He's a likable heel, convincingly brought to life by Futterman (who is probably best known for his role of Vincent Gray in the ""Judging Amy"" TV series).  It's a good performance, and one of the strengths of the film.
 As Jez, Townsend does a fine job, too, and though he's overshadowed a bit by Dylan-- intentionally the flashier of the two-- Jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience.  After all, this is the guy who at least seems a bit remorseful as he's taking other people's money and trust.  And it's interesting to compare Townsend's fairly reserved performance here with his role of the vampire Lestat in the more recent ""Queen of the Damned.""  He's a fine young actor whose style contrasts nicely with Futterman, and along with Beckinsale they make quite the team of scam artists.
 The one who draws the attention, however, is the lovely and charismatic Kate Beckinsale, who is beguiling in the role of Georgie.  She makes her character accessible, and plays her with a savvy, rather than naive sensibility, and it's a portrayal that works well.  Most importantly, she makes Georgie real, with a winsome appeal that makes you care about her and what happens to her.  She's the most grounded of the trio, and it's her character that keeps the story within the realm of credibility.  This may not be the stuff Oscars are made of, but it's an enjoyable, engaging performance that will win you over, without question.
 The supporting cast includes Rowena Cooper (Jez's Teacher), Myles Anderson (Jez, aged 8), Jacob Macoby (Dylan, aged 8), Jane Lapotaire (Dylan's Headmistress), Tom Chadbon (Mr. Greenaway), Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Ross), Peter McNamara (Geoff), Arabella Weir (Mrs. Stratton-Luce), Nickolas Grace (Mr. Stratton-Luce) and Claire Cox (Floss).  An easy-going comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes, ""Shooting Fish"" is a solid, feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment.  And in the final analysis, that's not such a bad deal; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.",1014940800,2,4619,4.73375
1007363,3,6305248893,"This is a very amusing comedy telling the tale of a couple of innovative conmen and their novel ways of scamming people out of money. It joins 'Shallow Grave' and 'Trainspotting' as one of the slew of British comedy-dramas of the mid to late 1990s that were great, original entertainment, but whose moral basis raises an eyebrow. In this particular offering, the crooks' greed and selfishness give way to a turn of events that ends up with a more 'Robin Hood' edge to it: steal from the rich to give to the poor etc. As with the other two pictures, there is a strong sense of identification with the main characters' attempts to make their fortune by robbery, deception, and trickery at other people's expense. Isn't it a sign of the times that we can watch a 'feel-good' movie that makes us 'feel good' about deception and falsehood, especially when it is motivated by greed and self-interest?
Still, it is a riveting movie with twists galore. There are a few scenes of laugh-out-loud hilarity, yet it is also a very subtle, refreshing type of comedy.",1003881600,,1052,4.691891891891892
1007364,5,6305248893,"Watch this film. Right away.
The story is about 2 ""nice"" con men,who are saving up for a mansion,to compensate them for being orphans as children. When a beautiful lady (kate beckinsale) comes on the scene,they find another project to work on,this time a personal one. The film progresses to show how conmen can indeed be conned themselves.
A must see film,with a spectacular soundtrack.you won't be dissapointed.",1003190400,,413,5.088235294117647
1007365,5,6305248893,"When I saw ""Shooting Fish"" not too long ago, I found it very enjoyable and funny, etc. And I also found Kate Beckinsale's character attractive and very sweet, and I like that in her. And also, Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend were outstanding as well. To me, ""Shooting Fish"" is not a cut-to-the-chase kind of film. It describes each character from his/her past to where they are now. But still, it is very, very funny and that anyone on this website should take the time to see it one day.",999561600,2,490,4.455555555555556
1007366,3,6305248893,"I thoroughly enjoyed this fine comedy at the cinema and bought the Region 1 DVD as soon as it hit the shelves.
I'll leave the story details to the other reviewers, I just wish to point out that this disc has several scenes edited out from the original cut. This unneccesary editing spoiled my enjoyment somewhat and reduced my rating from a 4 to a 3.
To be specific, I'm refering to the scene where the English middle-class enemies of our orphaned heroes trashed their makeshift home while spouting various patriotic phrases like ""England Forever!"" etc... It was quite an emotional scene to say the least, especially with the two heroes quivering in silent fear while these ""respectable gentlemen"" went about being total hooligans.
I'm definitely going to get the original UK region 2 disc.",989712000,,790,4.859259259259259
1007367,5,6305248893,"A wonderful movie that I have watched over and over again without being bored. This movie has everything, a great soundtrack, a great cast and an entertaining storyline that made me keep watching it.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! A romantic, funny and interesting story masterly directed by Stefan Schwartz",981504000,,297,5.340425531914893
1007368,5,6305248893,"I loved this movie although it took a couple of viewings before I caught on to a lot of what was going on. Its quite fast and there is a lot happening, much of which is in low voiced rapid exchanges between the two best friends who lead the movie.
Its about two entrepreneurial young men - American mastermind Dylan (Dan Futterman) and  his best friend, British inventor and all round geek, Jez (Stuart Townsend). They are both very likeable as actors and as characters. They run a complex series of scams to raise money to retire. Much of their funds come through winning competitions which they then work out clever scams to turn that prize into hard cash. Greenhouses, insulating material, inflatable dolls - this movie is worth it just to see what they do with some of their prizes.
Enter Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) who gets caught up in their schemes, but has a life and problems of her own to resolve. She is bright and proves pivotal in finding a final resolution that could solve all their problems.
One of the things I didn't figure out for a while was the significance of the title. I expect it refers to making easy money from suckers- 'shooting fish in a barrel' - but it is not used in the movie and only reffered to in one very quick exchange between Dylan and Jez. When they find a elderly lady who has no money they call her a 'thin fish' so they don't rip her off.
Its a very fun, charming film and well worth every one of five stars.",977270400,,1450,4.37037037037037
1007369,5,6305248893,"I absolutely love this movie. I've seen it like 5 times, and it's utterly charming and sooooo funny... My favourite character in jez, played brilliantly by stuart townsend. But i also love Kate Beckinsale ans Dan Futterman, they are so funny and easy-going and sweet in their parts.  The great brit pop combined with some nice oldies make a great soundtrack/music background, and I just enjoy watching this movie so much, even though I've seen it many times before.",971136000,,465,4.886075949367089

7887295,5,6305248893,"If you like British humor, you will love this movie.  It is one of the best comedy movies I have ever seen.  I did have to watch it several times before I caught all the jokes that were somewhat mumbled.  I would recommend this DVD wholeheartedly.",1337558400,,247,4.326086956521739
7887296,5,6305248893,This is a great overlooked movie.  The opening scene of greedy investors being fleeced is hilarious. Good twist at the end.,1293667200,,123,4.857142857142857
7887297,5,6305248893,"Reading through some of the reviews, looks like a lot of people are taking this movie way too seriously! One of the funniest things about Shooting Fish is how quirky and odd it is!
This is a screwball comedy with some pretty snappy one-liners. ""Insulation for the Nation."" (You'll just have to see it...) And if you pay attention to the stuff in the background you'll see some pretty bizarre, completely irrelevant easter eggs. I won't tell you any though. You have to discover them on your own.
If you like witty and obscure movies, you'll dig this one.",1245196800,,554,4.606060606060606
7887298,3,6305248893,"This is a good movie but american audiences don't get the full picture,
there is a scene where two men who are angry with the fact they have been conned break into the place where Jez lives and smash everything up all awhile yelling things randomly. And while this scene isn't to big in the overall plot i know it was there and i feel cheated.
but at the same time i understand because they are yelling things that relate back to english subjects like ""the right to have a warm beer"" which i guess americans wouldnt need to know but still it was in the orginal movie.",1204070400,,567,4.2592592592592595
7887299,5,6305248893,This is the most interesting thing about this movie. It is not the princess waiting for the prince but two orphan boys dreaming and waiting for their princess. On the meantime they think of incredible ways to take advandage of people. It has very funny situations that will really make you laugh. I highly recommend it.,1128384000,,319,4.714285714285714
7887300,1,6305248893,"Every aspect covered by this film is different from the way the real world works.  This includes the totally false technology, business leaders with poor judgment, government officials that give people's personal data to telephone callers, a medical student with the intelligence of a 12 year old, and the way the tax system works.  The only realistic part was the few minutes of Phyllis Logan being a competent woman business executive.  In her case this probably was not acting, as she is a pretty competent woman to start with.  Her part is the only reason my copy has not found its way to the trashcan.  There is a reason why new copies are under $...and used ones around $....",1056844800,2,681,4.689075630252101
