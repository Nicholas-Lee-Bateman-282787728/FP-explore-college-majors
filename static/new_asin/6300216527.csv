250654,4,6300216527,"One of the most uncompromising American dramas of the 70s, this takes a penetrating look at the addictive mindset of the gambler as no film did before that and none since as well.  The writing by James Toback is superb and the direction by Karel Reisz is just as good.  James Caan, in one of his best roles, plays a professor of literature--an ivory tower guy who drives himself right to the edge.  The story implies that the possible reason for this is his patrician upbringing; his mother's a successful and respected physician and his uncle, an extremely successful businessman. And Axel Freed--Caan's character--needs much more than all the myriad assumptions that a blue-blooded background provides.
Even his girlfriend, Mickey (broadly played by Lauren Hutton), is upscale.  Caan deftly and convincingly portrays someone who takes advantage of his class and its privileges and at the same time obsessively needs the ""juice"" of danger.  The ending is a strong finish to a great movie; Axel tests the waters of what could very likely bring the ultimate danger.  The real question is, Does he want that or not?
It's interesting to see both James Woods and M. Emmett Walsh in small and early roles here, as well as some 70s stalwarts: Paul Sorvino, Vic Tayback, and Steven Keats.  The mix of the highbrow and the street is a great one.  All actors do a terrific job.

250655,3,6300216527,"A Very sardonic James Caan plays a self destructive addicted gambler to the hilt. Even during moments of supposed euphoria..Caan seems to know the ""drug"" will wear off son.
Students and other people have no meaning..they are not even a diversion..because his one goal is ACTION..and without action he is nothing to himself as he is a lonely man on a very lonely journey..Paul Sorvin plays "" Hips"" ( aptly named) A very downbeat film with a terrifying finale..if one comprehends the reflection in the mirror.",1001980800,,507,4.906976744186046
250656,5,6300216527,"James Caan is superb as a college professor obsessed with putting his money and his psyche on the line because of the rush he gets from gambling. In debt up to his ears, Caan wins the money he owes back only to lose it again in a bizarre roller coaster ride. As he tells his students, 2 plus 2 may equal 4, but he has the right to say that it may equal 5 tomorrow, if his will is strong enough. Caan's willingness to place himself at risk because he believes he can alter the outcome of events by force of will is linked to his study of Dostoevsky's The Gambler. His journey corrupts and alienates everyone around him as his own quest for purity remains intact. The viewer may find Caan's character insane and reckless, but the philosophy at the core of this thrilling psychological drama (written by James Toback) is one worth living. This is the only film I know of other than Hannah & Her Sisters by Woody Allen to use a quote from e.e. cummings.",995155200,,949,4.307262569832402
250657,3,6300216527,"I grew up amongst gamblers, spending much of my time hustling bowling and gin rummy throughout the Midwest, until, at 17, I shuffled off to the Ivy-covered walls of a prestigious Eastern College.
This gives me much  simpatico with Axel Freed, the central character and portrait of  self-destruction, the gambler, and James Toback, the film's author.  Toback's own reflections suggest that Axel is in many ways  auto-biographical.
As a film, The Gambler is shortsighted, an ambitious  but nonetheless failed attempt by a first-time screenwriter in difficult  waters. It is not without its brilliance-its relentless dedication toward  conveying that any gambler's true goal is not success, but utter  humiliation-destruction of one's self, and anything and anyone around him.  It can be no other way.
In the 1990's where independent film has achieved  an emergence and respect in its own, a film like this might have found the  strength among the very talented people involved, (Toback, James Caan,  Karel Reisz) to emerge into a true gem. Alas this 70's neglected studio  cast-off didn't have that opportunity.
London Lee is great in support,  Paul Sorvino and Burt Young are well cast as Freed's mob-ties. Young's  performance as a mob leg-breaker includes quite a raw, and shocking  collection scene.
Probably a pass for any but the gambling addict, for  them, a head (as in tape-head) burner. For those who are intrigued by  Toback's intelligent approach to the seedier side, try his next effort,  Fingers (1978), a diamond in the rough.",950313600,3,1539,5.182926829268292

250721,4,6300216527,"Gritty, well-acted entry in the 70s era American Realism school, with superb performances from all concerned. Although ""The Godfather"" may have been considered Caan's best role, I would argue that he has never been better than when playing a morally bankrupt English Professor who has a serious gambling addiction. As a famous book says, ""frothy emotional appeals"" don't help, as he literally spirals down into a rabbit hole of questionable choices. Caan's performance would be worth the price of admission, but a sterling supporting cast makes this very good film an excellent one. The great Paul Sorvino as Caan's friend/bookie (an oxymoron if there ever was one), the late, great Burt Young as a nearly anonymous thug, Lauren Hutton (yes, Lauren Hutton) as the obligatory, and nearly un-necessary girlfriend and a marvelous little early role by James Woods as an insensitive Banker. Lest you think there are not good female roles in this pretty male film, Jacqueline Brookes is marvelous as Caan's suffering mother.

250725,5,6300216527,"An important thought-piece on risk. Caan's character is hard to like, and risk in the setting of lowlife gamblers and Las Vegas casinos gives us a particularly degenerate take on the questions. But the film is an elegant portrayal of the glory, tragedy and foolhardiness of risk-taking. Caan's many pretensions and his terrible presumptions when it comes to his family and girlfriend, stack the deck powerfully. But despite all his blatantly self-destructive behavior, we (some of us, at least) cheer him on and hope he will be lucky one more time--a demonstration of how compelling risk taking is.

250766,4,6300216527,"Caught this on first release, seeing the recent remake sent me back for another look.  A very solidly built film which has the advantage of a script that has the stamp of personal experience.  Some might attribute to the well to do a tendency toward an inflated sense of entitlement.  This sense of entitlement is also a marker for narcissists.  For me, the film speaks more to the condition of a narcissist than of a degenerate gambler.  What complicates matters is a perverse attitude about harboring a death wish.  This might be addressed in the concluding scenes where for once Axel takes a gamble that his family will not be able to cover.  I think of Axel as a prince of the city kind of figure, which is why he has enough rope for all this. Memorable bit: Axel tells his bookie he would have no trouble at all if only he stuck to the bets he knew he'd win and goes on to explain why he does not do so.  There are slight hints of what Axel is so put out by.  Whatever they gave him, he sure enjoyed making throwing it away a big show.",1446768000,,1040,4.238578680203045
250767,4,6300216527,"I looked at this 70s film because I had just looked at the very recent The Gambler staring Mark Walberg.  It's very much the same plot, except that Cann's character is a masochist, seeking to be punished for his gambling habit, and Walberg's character utilizes almost the same series of events to triumph over his problem.  Really worthwhile to look at both films, and then, if you're lucky, have a friend to discuss them with.

Although plenty of films have been made surrounding gambling addictions since The Gambler, this movie stands the test of time by putting the audience alongside the character on the train wreck of self loathing that ensues.

Some of the dialog just laid there like a soggy log. There were so many things that were not fleshed out with regard to his character's motivation. And stupid choices were not explained well. But you knew that stupid choices had to be made, or the movie would have been over in 30 minutes. For the most part, we got very good secondary actors having to deal with mediocre, thin dialog as well.

Regarding James Caan's performance, again, you just never got a fully fleshed out character whom you could identify with. Perhaps if Caan were given better writing, he would have been able to do more with it. This film is just much too superficial and poorly written to care.",1422403200,,821,4.547297297297297

The recent version has been panned and I disagree- the writing is VERY present and all, including Wahlburg, perform well. In THIS version Caan does a uniformly great job interacting with all the other characters. This guy curses and uses very foul language (especially over the opening credits- be forewarned) but his performance compared to his portrayal of Sonny Corleone is almost muted. And the music in THIS version is superior - based on Mahler's First Symphony- but I have trouble with a lot of 'new' music",1420588800,,784,4.814814814814815

251300,5,6300216527,"There have been many fine movies over the years about alcoholism and drug addiction but relatively few about an equally pernicious addiction... compulsive gambling. Forty years ago, James Toback wrote the screenplay for ""The Gambler,"" a semi-autobiographical script (originally planned as a novel) about his own problem gambling, and James Caan, who was battling his own cocaine addiction at the time, starred. The life experiences of both men showed through clearly in the movie. Simply put, ""The Gambler"" is the best, and most realistic depiction of compulsive gambling I've ever seen in a movie.

Caan plays Axel Freed, like Toback, an English teacher at a New York community college. He's smart, easy going, funny, and a nice guy to be around. Everybody likes him: his students, his relatives, his girlfriend (Lauren Hutton), his bookie (Paul Sorvino), and even the loan sharks to whom he goes. His only problem is that he can't stop gambling, on anything. At one point, he even bets $20 against a dime in a game of one-on-one basketball against a street kid. And he has managed to get himself $44,000 in debt to Sorvino and the people Sorvino reports to. It's only because he is a genuinely likable guy that they haven't pushed him harder for the money, but his time is clearly running out.

The movie follows Caan around for several days as he tries to raise the money. His mother, a well-to-do doctor, gives him what money she can because she's genuinely afraid what will happen to him, but he uses the money to take Hutton with him to Las Vegas to gamble further. Incredibly, he goes on a hot streak and wins enough to square all his debts and have a good bit left over. However, he blows everything betting on basketball games and has to figure out some other way to raise the money.

Many people who watch the movie have a hard time believing just how or why Caan can keep going like this, but the movie eventually makes his compulsion quite clear. Like a junkie addicted to heroin, he's addicted to the thrill of winning. He knows the odds are against him, but he convinces himself that he can beat the odds. When he does, it's a big thrill, so he bets again in search of an even bigger thrill. The more pressure he feels in his everyday life... such as arguments with his girl friend or relatives, the more he feels he needs the thrill. Eventually, of course, his luck--and the thrills--inevitably run out. This rationale makes no sense to most people; addiction never does. But, as Toback explains it and Caan demonstrates it, viewers can see how even an intelligent person can get hooked.

""The Gambler"" was directed by Karel Reisz, who had a terrific sense of visual style, and he contrasts the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas when Caan is winning, with the gloom of the New York scenes where he eventually loses all over again. The movie's signature visual, a shot of Caan at the tables, surrounded by neon lights creating an angelic halo effect, stayed with me since I first saw the movie in a theater forty years ago. Jerry Fielding contributes a classical based score that creates a mood of grand tragedy which, essentially, the movie is.

I own a DVD of ""The Gambler"" but hadn't watched it for several years until I went to see the Mark Wahlberg remake last week and decided to watch the original again. Seeing the two movies almost back-to-back has given me a renewed appreciation for the original. Although the storylines of both versions are somewhat similar, the original has power, emotional depth, and credibility that the slick remake completely lacks. The only good thing I can say about the remake is that it might prompt some people to discover the original. ""The Gambler"" is a nearly forgotten minor gem from one of the best eras of American film making, the early 1970s. Watching it is no gamble; it's a sure thing.

NOTE: The specs on the Amazon page say that the movie has a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. That is incorrect. As indicated on the DVD cover, the movie is anamorphic widescreen with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.",1420070400,2,4040,4.683098591549296
251301,1,6300216527,"I wanted to see the original before I saw the remake with Mark Wahlberg.

251378,2,6300216527,"Pretty lame. James Caan was hot off The Godfather when this came out in 1974. Improbably, he plays a college professor and compulsive gambler. But no matter how he tries to come off as a Shakespeare-quoting college English professor, he still looks and sounds like a Mafia wiseguy. I've never seen an English professor wear his flashy shirts open halfway down his hairy chest, for one thing. Caan's thick New York accent doesn't help. His diction still reeks of hitman, not wordsmith.
The plot is some lame risk-it-all about losing and winning. Most of the other actors are pretty bad.
I got very bored. You do see a very young Lauren Hutton playing his love interest.

251501,4,6300216527,"This is an excellent psychological film that deserves a revisit and a re-evaluation.  It is the story of a compulsive gambler who is truly addicted to gambling despite the many disasters that accompany this addiction. James Caan is excellent and perfectly portrays that those with such an addiction may act rationally in most of their life but in the area of their addictive compulsion, they have no control. Addictions of all sorts bring negative consequences and yet the addicted person hangs on to the behavior despite the pain that they go through and which is also inflicted on those around them.

James Caan plays Axel Freed, the son of a highly successful mother and the grandson of a highly successful business man.  He has become a professor of literature. Yet, his addiction, at first hidden, emerges until everyone around him sees the self destruction that this had evoked.  His girlfriend, played by beautiful Lauren Hutton, is initially supportive, and then tries to be co-dependent, and then eventually his addiction takes a toll on their relationship.

Gambling addiction results in Axel spiraling downward into the rough life of organized crime and pay-offs.  Paul Sorvino plays a successful bookie who actually cares that Axel is falling ever deeper into his addiction.  The use of the music of Mahler was very effective and unexpected. I think it was a really good, under-rated classic film that deserves a second look by current movie viewers.",1399248000,,1462,5.066666666666666

251563,4,6300216527,"THE GAMBLER (1974), is a passive, visual movie, with the one and
only James Caan, who plays an English Literature professor, who
comes to believe as reality the poetry, artistic thoughts and
beliefs he teaches to his classroom of students. The theory is that
2+2 is not 4, it's more than that, and life shouldn't be spent
counting the minutes, hours down, but rather pushing the envelope,
taking risks and enjoying the ride, the thrills while it lasts.

As such, Caan's character ""in theory"" realizes he's a compulsive
gambler, hopelessly addicted to all kinds of bets on all kinds of
activities, his life hanging by a thread, and jeopardizing not only
the love, respect of his family and girlfriend, but their
psychological and physical well-being through a wreckless behavior
that sees him lose thousands of dollars. The difficulty for Caan, is
accepting his ""theoretical addition"" as ""reality"" and as a
""objective, externally verifiable and observable fact"".

Clearly, Caan is at his peak, physically and mentally. The actor
shows his characteristic relaxed, subtle, self-contented, easy going
and confident demeanor, until unique circumstances occur, requiring
agression, physical exertion, which he delivers when called on.

The film prominently features a Ford Mustang convertible in over 1/3
of the film.

The whole gamut of individuals implicated in gambling as an industry
is shown, from collectors of illegal debts, to loan sharks (at 3%
per week or 12O% annual interest), casinos, bookies, pimps,
narco-traffickers, etc.

Caan reflects on his inability to face or control his gambling
addiction, with words such as "" I can't lose. Why? I'm hot as a
pistol, and I am the one placing the bets!""

There are a number of smart quips, such as ""I've seen nuts before,
but you've got a watermelon"" as scruples; or Caan's Dad, commenting
on his girlfriend: ""a man of virtue and character would not take
that woman as your wife, she's a playboy's girl"".

In his subconscience, apart from the compulsion, Caan perhaps feels
that those who lack all addictions in their personalities are
boring, unpopular, don't know how to enjoy themselves, or so goes
the poetry he reads, taking what was imaginary as reality, and
dropping into an abyss of debt, addiction, low self-worth,
irrationality, confusion, loss of direction, suicidal behavior.

Some curious aspects are typical from the 7O's, namely sideburns,
large US cars, and the courtesy, politeness and amicable human
interaction between strangers in restaurants, at the table, etc,
which seems to have been lost 30 years later, too often, at least in
the movies.

Sorvino plays a mobster, involved in the bookie and loan sharking

debtors.

251566,3,6300216527,"James Caan is Axel Freed, an English professor in New York City.  He also has a serious gambling problem.  As the movie opens, Axel has racked up $44,000 in gambling debts from a bookie/loan shark named Hips (Paul Sorvino).  Fortunately, Axel's family is extremely wealthy, so he manages to convince his mother to give him the money.  He assures her that this is the end of the gambling.  However, as soon as he gets the money, he picks up his most recent girlfriend (Lauren Hutton) and heads to Las Vegas.

""The Gambler"" is a rather good examination of how gambling can affect someone's life, as well as the lives of people around them.  Caan's character nicely exemplifies the psychology behind how many people develop gambling problems.  He explains that he's afraid of winning, not of losing.  In his class, he discusses a piece by William Carlos Williams which criticizes George Washington for being risk-averse - it's easy to draw the parallels to Axel.  Caan does a nice job here, with some relatively subtle acting.  He received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Drama - the only major award nomination the movie received.  The script by James Toback is loosely based on the novella by Dostoevsky (Axel is named Alexei in the novella).  Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes of ""The Gambler"" simply aren't very believable, as Axel's life spins further out of control and he becomes more desperate.

agression, physical exertion, which he delivers when called on.

The film prominently features a Ford Mustang convertible in over 1/3
of the film.

The whole gamut of individuals implicated in gambling as an industry
is shown, from collectors of illegal debts, to loan sharks (at 3%
per week or 12O% annual interest), casinos, bookies, pimps,
narco-traffickers, etc.

Caan reflects on his inability to face or control his gambling
addiction, with words such as "" I can't lose. Why? I'm hot as a
pistol, and I am the one placing the bets!""

There are a number of smart quips, such as ""I've seen nuts before,
but you've got a watermelon"" as scruples; or Caan's Dad, commenting
on his girlfriend: ""a man of virtue and character would not take
that woman as your wife, she's a playboy's girl"".

In his subconscience, apart from the compulsion, Caan perhaps feels
that those who lack all  addictions in their personalities are
boring, unpopular, don't know how to enjoy themselves, or so goes
the poetry he reads, taking what was imaginary as reality, and
dropping into an abyss of debt, addiction, low self-worth,
irrationality, confusion, loss of direction, suicidal behavior.

Some curious aspects are typical from the 7O's, namely sideburns,
large US cars, and the courtesy, politeness and amicable human
interaction between strangers in restaurants, at the table, etc,
which seems to have been lost 30 years later, too often, at least in
the movies.

Sorvino plays a mobster, involved in the bookie and loan sharking
activities, with a modicum of patience and humanity with the
debtors.

251629,4,6300216527,This film shows the mentality and thought process of someone who is a gambling addict. The lengths that James Caan goes to keep playing even though his ability to pick winners has eroded and the affect it has on those in his life is right on the mark. The movie accurately shows how the glamour of winning becomes secondary to the need just to have the risk and unflinchingly shows what can happen if you get caught in this complusive trap. It is a scenario I know about from first hand experience,1156636800,,497,4.413043478260869
251630,4,6300216527,"James Caan was in some of the hardest hitting films by some of the hardest hitting directors of the seventies and early eighties including Coppola's Godfather I(72), Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite (75)and Michael Mann's Thief (81). He also played a number of athlete roles, including Rollerball(75). Whether he's playing an athlete or not Caan moves like an athlete, and he gets jumpy if he has to sit still for too long, and so he's interesting to watch even when he's just crossing the street because its like he's always on the scent of something, always on the prowl.

In the opening scenes of Gambler (74) Caan is playing the tables in an all-night casino and losing one hand after another. By morning, as he's driving home, he realizes he has lost 44,000 dollars. But the jumpy Caan still hasn't been satisfied and when he sees some teens playing basketball he stops his car and hustles up a game. They only have ten bucks but thats enough. It's the thrill of the game and the thrill of the bet that turns him on and he really comes to life on the courts.

His real job we soon find out is pretty high class. He's a college English professor who lectures on Dostoyevsky and the failed/corrupted/compromised American dream (good solid early 70's staple topic that last one). And he does it really well. He's certainly not your usual professor because its obvious just by looking at him and listening to him that he's more physycal than mental and he's actually interested in the thrill of living life and not the agony of writing books about it. Caan's ""Axel Freed"" is a guy who has seen a lot and done a lot and his students appreciate that he's not a guy who spends his afternoons in the library. But where he does spend his afternoons and evenings is getting him in deep trouble.

The gambling problem seems to stem from the fact that he's never really escaped from the safe confines and purse strings of his social class and this embarrases him and makes him feel inauthentic and unmanly. Its like he was born to a reality or class that never fit, and he's been trying to return to his rightful home (the streets, the basketball courts, the tennis courts, the boxing ring) ever since. Money has always stood between Axel Freed and the life he imagines tobe his own. Even when at home with his lady he can't stand still; he's perpetually shadow boxing in the mirror and perusing the sports page and ringin' up his bookie. Day to day, moment to moment, he lives for the thrill of those last seconds of a game when his whole life depends on whether the basketball will or will not go in. Watching him take incredible risks is painful because we fear where it will all lead, but its also exhilerating.

Caan is tough in The Gambler, no doubt, but the role of Axel Freed allows him to stretch and show that he can play not only a physical guy but a physical guy with a lot going on in his head. Its a pleasure to see James Caan sitting in front of an English class lecturing to a group of attentive students about why man does not always follow the dictates of reason. ""Reason,"" Axel reads from his copy of Dostoyevsky, ""satisfies our rational requirements, but desire encompasses everything."" What makes this especially interesting is that we know Axel Freed isn't just some egghead with a set of theories but that he's taking his lessons from real life.

Axel seems to have a great job and a great sexy girlfriend (Lauren Hutton) but its just not enough to keep his attention; he needs that extra adrenalin rush that only extreme situations that sports and gambling and pushin' the bounds of reason can provide.

The film reminds me of Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces but its much grittier and the ending is so unexpected and raw that many may be turned off by it but it has the advantage of giving you a final glimpse of this character that you are not likely to forget.

Unexpected ending but hits right where it should.

If you wanted to you could probably analyze this film from a number of angles. One being that modern man just isn't satisfied living in his settled society doing mundane tasks but then that might sound too academic and too trite and thats just what Axel's trying to escape from.

O yes the film is like a yearbook of seventies actors as there are about fifteen recognizable faces in supporting roles: including Lauren Hutton as girlfriend, Paul Sorvino as bookie, Huggie Bear as a pimp, and James Woods as a snotty bank clerk who Caan has to rough up.

Karel Reisz was himself a Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia. He fled to the UK to escape the Holocaust so the story of Axel Freed's uncle is especially interesting in that light. Reisz also directed another tremendous seventies film called Who'll Stop the Rain (1978) based on Robert Stone's Dog Soldiers and starring Nick Nolte and Tuesday Weld.",1154131200,,4828,4.571098265895953

251632,3,6300216527,"Obstensibly about gambling addiction, this film is in fact a portrait of the addictive personality. Caan's character (Axel Freed) represents a complex individual who is a study in contadictions. His chaotic spiral into the depths of his addiction both mirrors and contrasts with the insightful portaits of his classroom lectures. His societal role as gifted college professor and child of a nouveau-riche immigrant family contradicts a wholey individualistic and reckless lifestyle in constant search for the emotional rush of living on the edge. This, his true addiction, is revealed at the end of the film when his gambling ""career"" has seemingly ended. A rare sub-commentary contrasts the humanly personal sides of Axel's mob associates with their violent career personas, bringing to mind the movie Mean Streets (with the youthful pairing of Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro). Indeed, the movie may suffer from attempting to deal with these general themes on too many levels.

A few graphic scenes and raw emotionalism give this film an edge that is appropriate to its themes. Some viewers may be put off by racial stereotypes stemming from this era of blaxploitation. Otherwise, acting and direction are adequate to the task, although characters are somewhat one dimensional; and the plot is thought provoking, if not always engaging.",1092528000,3,1339,5.316037735849057

He throws away his birth rite to riches, his family, a beauty (Lauren Hutton in her first significant screen role).  It's a road well traveled by the lost and Caan has it mastered.

251637,5,6300216527,"Veteran legendary actor James Caan was at his peak 10 years into his on-screen career in this James Toback classic.  Director Karel Reisz gets one of Caan's most convincing performances to date, as well as terrific support from the rest of this well recognized ensemble cast.

Caan plays Axel Freed, an English Lit professor, who comes from a well-to-do family.  Although Axel has success in his career and a beautiful, but detached girlfriend played by70s covergirl Lauren Hutton, he's looking for something far LESS out of life.  He is a hopeless gambling junkie.  Caan is so terrific and tragic as a man who can't control himself in the face of any kind of risky wager.  He'll take the worst odds, never quit while he's ahead, and certainly NEVER knows when to fold 'em.  Axel seems to be happiest as the loser ironically, because he never keeps his winnings, just wagering again until the profit is lost.

Paul Sorvino, another veteran talent is in a very early role here as ""Hips"", Axel's bookie.  Hips has done just about everything he can do to convince Axel of his self-destructive habit, but to no avail.  In a terrific scene, Axel gets a good look at his future, as he is sent to collect a debt from a deadbeat with an enforcer played by real life buddy, Burt Young, more famous for being ""Rocky"" brother-in-law.  Axel watches as the deadbeat has his furnishings demolished by an abusive Young, and gets a solid working over culminating in some broken bones.  Does this spell the future for Axel?  You have to see for yourself.

 James Caan has never looked so good, or played such a gut-wrenching role.  The scene where he's sitting in his bathtub listening to a game he's got a crucial bet on, causes you to actually feel his desperation.  We are not so sure he actually wants to win though.  He seems to crave the humiliation of being the loser more than the victory of being a winner.  He even humiliates himself in front of his students by trying to fix a college basketball game, to pay yet another debt he's accrued.

Besides Sorvino, Hutton, and Young, there are also other classic screen veterans to catch in small roles.  When Caan pleads with his doctor mom to give him her savings,  they deal with the terrific James Woods, as a banker who asks for one too many forms of ID.  Vic Tayback is seen as well.

If you are a James Caan fan, as I am, and you want to see an example of some of his finest dramatic work, I highly recommend ""The Gambler"" as well as his subsequent 1981 Michael Mann classic ""Thief"" (see my review) as two of my favorites in his vast filmography.  For comedy, Caan is classic as ANOTHER gambler in the hilarious ""Honeymoon In Vegas""(see my review for more).

 ""The Gambler"" is without doubt, one of the finest dramatizations of the degradation, the hopelessness, the fleeting thrill, and the moral bankruptcy that awaits  any individual with this addiction.  We as viewers will become hooked on this amazing story, but, unlike Axel Freed, we will gain from this experience, with nothing to lose.",1025136000,6,3039,4.6280373831775705
7805969,4,6300216527,"Apart from drugs and booze, probably the most costly addiction there is out there is Gambling.  And yet it is an addiction that a hell of a lot of people cant seem to break, any more successfully than some can at the other two vices.  One wouldnt think that such a grim subject matter could make for a good, let alone compelling film.  But back in the experimental, anything-goes world of 1970s Hollywood, screenwriter James Toback, who by his own admission had been a compulsive gambler prior to his realizing how much better off he was at writing, made it compelling in the form of THE GAMBLER.

In this 1974 film, directed by the Czech-born Karel Reisz, known for such films as 1966s MORGAN, James Caan portrays Axel Freed, a highly respected professor of literature at City College of New York who seems to have it all.  He has a great girlfriend (Lauren Hutton, in one of her earliest roles), and a line of work in which he regales his students in George Washington, and even the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevskys classic 1866 short novel The Gambler.  Unfortunately, he himself is a gambler, in the most literal sense possible.  And not just any typical here-and-there type, but one addicted to the rush of betting on casino games in Las Vegas (or Lost Wages, according to many a wag), and on sporting events.  Its not the winning or the losing that he cares about, really.  It is the thrill, such as it is, of not knowing which way or another his bets are going to go, that fuels his habit.  He gets so caught up in the rush, explaining that there is no juice in not risking, that pretty soon he is up to his neck in gambling debts of up to $44,000and to the kind of people who don't take all that kindly to their clients not paying up, including, among others, Paul Sorvino and Burt Young.  It comes down to asking one of his students basically to throw a basketball game to get him out of his fiduciary jam; but by then, his self-destructiveness is pretty much a foregone conclusion.

Such an unsavory character just wouldnt fly these days in Hollywood, even though this film was reworked in 2014 with Mark Wahlberg in Caans role (and was not all that memorable).  But Caan, who up to this point had already gained a sizeable reputation as an actor via his role as Brian Piccolo in the classic 1971 TV film BRIANS SONG, and then as Sonny Corleone in THE GODFATHER, does such a good turn at playing the addicted teacher that we definitely feel for him in a lot of ways, even though we can despise what he does to others through that habit, not only to Hutton, but also to his mother (Jacqueline Brooks) and father (Morris Carnovsky).

By todays standards, even at 111 minutes, and with a fair amount of four-letter words in Tobacks script, this film isn't exactly a fast film.  But not all films have to be fast to be compelling; and it is because of Caans performance, Reiszs direction, and the steady editing of Roger Spottiswoode, who had worked with Sam Peckinpah on, among other things, STRAW DOGS, that THE GAMBLER works well enough to make even the slow spots more than bearable.  It also doesnt hurt to have James Woods here, in one of his earliest roles, along with M. Emmett Walsh, Stuart Margolin, and Vic Tayback, either.

What is also notable is how the nature in Caans characters addiction are enhanced by the interpolation of sections of Gustav Mahlers Symphony No. 1 (known as the Titan Symphony), both in the score by the much-underrated Jerry Fielding (Peckinpahs go-to composer), and in a performance by the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam under the direction of Bernard Haitink as heard on a stereo in Caans apartment.  The use of Mahler is used by both Reisz and Toback in a very intellectual way, much like Stanley Kubrick had utilized Richard Strauss Also Sprach Zarathustra for his film 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, to emphasize the sinister, almost nightmarish quality of the downfall of Caans character.

In summation, while it is not exactly the most rapidly-paced film ever made, and is sometimes quite disturbing, THE GAMBLER is also exceptionally compelling, and a solid look at the experimentalism of 1970s filmmaking, in a way that far too many Hollywood films of the 21st century are not.",1521936000,,4229,4.644772117962466

James Caan; loved him as a youngster, then grew tired of him, now after a reassessment, I can't get enough of the guy and consider him an absorbing actor who, via method or whatever, is so good at portraying confident yet tragic figures that as long as his films are available i will be giving them space in my life as time permits.

That's about all I have in me tonight. I am extremely tired. That doesn't matter, but I will say that this film, like the above mentioned Reisz film has a depth to it that, while enjoying the initial watch on surface levels, will yield further layers to ponder and study concerning the plight of modern man faced with the dilemma of addiction.

I won't go so far as to say that we are all addicted to something, as I have met a few people in whom I have had to express nothing but admiration in regards to their unbending constitution. Unfortunately most of us need some sort of gamble, a roll of the dice so to speak, to make it through periods of our life where very little certain answers are provided. That's where faith comes in, or doesn't.

7805972,4,6300216527,"I was commenting to my Mother how this film from 1974 had it been made today would have at most been a PG-13 film. But in 1974 it was over the top. There were only two or three instances of curse words used and one brief spell of nudity. Other than that it's a tame movie other than its subject matter. My Mother is an English Literature Professor and she recognized the irony in Dostoevsky in ""The Gambler"".

James can plays a college professor who is a chronic gambler. He gambles and gambles and gambles to the point where even his acquaintances in the life begin to question him. Even when bailed out by his Mother Caan still gambles the money that she gave to him! To me it makes no sense but to anyone who has been a gambler they can understand the plight that this character goes through. It's very sad and as Caan's character goes into the depths he is forced to solicit a basketball player's assistance in point shaving. this saves Caan's character but despite this ""second chance"" he ends up back where he started when he puts himself and his reputation on the line. The ending of the movie is a bit far-fetched but it matches the tone of his character, a man who has no self control over his actions, a man who lives a double life but in that second life cannot control himself.

I highly recommend this film. I give it Four Stars. I'm the 176th person to review the 1974 original film.  I will also review the 2014 version. Buy this and you won't be disappointed.

Sam Goldwyn once said that it is the last five minutes of a movie that makes it memorable. The air of anticipation and sense of dread that runs through the 1974 version gives way to a finale that is impossible to forget.

James Caan, in a performance that at first seems wooden but turns out to be just about perfect, plays Axel Freed, a college professor with an addiction to gambling. Gambling rules Axel's life to the point where it undermines his loyalty to his family, his girlfriend and ultimately himself. Although he is absorbed with gambling, he comes from a privileged background.

This back-story gives ""The Gambler"" an unusual edge. His mother is a leading surgeon at a large city hospital and his grandfather, who he reveres, is a wealthy Jewish immigrant who has made good on the American Dream.

Axel is also seriously in debt and it is a condition that does not change much throughout the movie. Unfortunately he is in debt to people who do not forgive non-payment.

After borrowing money from his mother to pay off the debt, he takes his girlfriend to Las Vegas and gambles it instead. It is as though he is forcing the odds to the point where he will be destroyed. His girlfriend, Billie, played by Lauren Hutton, who is attracted to Axels sense of danger, finds him even too reckless for her.

To save himself, Axel is forced to morally descend to the lowest point in his life.

Finally, he receives the horrible punishment he seems to seek by pushing his luck in the wrong end of town. The film ends with a cinematic image not easily erased from the memory.

The screenplay by James Toback was largely autobiographical. He must have been seeking catharsis through the painful self-revelations in this story, which if it makes any point it is that the ultimate objective of the chronic gambler is to lose.

Karel Reisz directed the film in a dispassionate manner that adds to its power. This is a film with little sympathy or compromise. It is difficult for the audience to like Axel. He seems alienated from the normal joys of life. The only way he can lift his emotional level is to walk along the edge of the precipice.

An unusual background score helps give the film its all-pervading mood. Based on Mahler's Symphony #1, ""The Titan"", the score was arranged by Jerry Fielding, a fine composer in his own right. Despite its classical origins, Mahler's work in this film sounds ominous and surprisingly contemporary.

It's only when it's over that you realise how remarkable The Gambler really is  without a doubt, one of the most arresting films of the 1970's.",1483660800,2,2820,4.663306451612903
