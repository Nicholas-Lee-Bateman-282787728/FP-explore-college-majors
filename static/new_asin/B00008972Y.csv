1829605,5,B00008972Y,"What do you get when the 2 wittiest and most intelligent comedians in the world of Jewish humor of the late 20th century not only costar in, but co-produce a movie?  Answer: You get a serious comedy (or dramady: part comedy, part drama) that holds your attention for it's entire length.  In this MGM gem of 1988 brilliantly directed by Henry (Fonzie) Winkler, Billy Crystal and the late Alan King give probably the best performances of their lives that does just that.  Crystal is Abbie Polin MD, probably the most successful and best loved by his patients heart surgeon to ever serve the New York City Hospital System.  While performing a routine procedure on 1 of said adoring admirers, he suffers a mild heart attack himself, making everyone's favorite doctor a patient in his own hospital.  As part of his recovery, his co surgeon and love of his life Lisa McConnell (played by one time American Dreamer: Jobeth Williams) recommends he goes out to Hollywood to patch things up with his estranged dad Abe (King) who is the King of the movie extras.  Abe is equally loved by coworkers and big stars alike (watch for Sean Connery in his costume for the Presidio in a brief scene), but he never had a starring role, and his career always came before his family.  At first you think these 2 will walk briefly in and out of each others lives, until Abbie diagnoses Abe's strange headaches and memorizing speeches of yesteryear as a Cerebral Aneurysm.  Of all things to reunite the spark of father and son love, but it does the job.  At any rate, Lisa flies out to meet Abe, Abbie plays movie agent to get Abe a speaking part, and then..............Well I'm sure you can guess what goes in the blank. But suffice it to say, a very touching film we can all learn from.  The best thing of all is though Abe gets the last word in, and it IS a funny one.  Definitely worth buying before it goes out of print.  By the way, the Amazon description says ""Anamorphic Widescreen"", it is actually double sided (full screen copy on side B).  Alan King, my copy of this disc is dedicated to your memory.  We hope you will still make us laugh at the Carnegie Hall in the sky.",1177632000,,2158,4.5
1829606,4,B00008972Y,"An artful little film. The plot isn't original -- estranged father and son reconciling in the nick of time -- and has been done before and since (Jack Lemmon, ""Tribute"", ""Dad""; Paul Newman, ""Harry and Son""; Jackie Gleason, ""Nothing in Common""). But director Henry Winkler keeps ""Memories of Me"" happy-poignant rather than tragic, and earns big kudoes for keeping the runaway talents of Billy Crystal and Alan King on-track as much as he does. Where the film shines are the incidentals that make life good.
Crystal plays the straight man, for the most part (only a few runaway moments), Dr. Abbie Polin, a New York heart surgeon who suffers a coronary while working on some nice lady's heart (""Kansas?""). JoBeth Williams, playing his shikse ladyfriend, Lisa (""Dr. Christian""), goads Abbie into reconciling with the father he'd led her to believe was dead. So Abbie is off to California, where Pop, King as Abe Polin, is ""the King of the Extras"".
Williams' performance is easily overlooked, but she also has one of the best lines in summing up Abbie's aloofness, ""You are great in bed, but then you don't know how to hold my hand."" And King hasn't often carried a film to this degree (""Just Tell Me What You Want"" being another), but he and Crystal are magic together.
Some highlights: Abbie's trumpeting. Abbie keeping up with the pink-clad jogger. The history of the courtroom wawlah. The singing impression/telegram. Abe calling for a hora on Olvera Street, with mariachis (""Have a tequila!""). Abbie standing in as Abe's agent, and Abe's casting interview. Abe rehearsing his death scene (""You will notice that the picture is slightly askew."").
The DVD transfer is anamorphic but otherwise nothing special. What artifacts and graininess remain aren't distracting. Includes the original full-screen theatrical trailer along with pitches for other MGM releases. A blooper reel, if such could be unearthed for a future repackaging, is for now, alas, sorely missing.
Even so, as Abbie says, ""This is an interesting collage.""",1049673600,13,2021,5.072072072072072
