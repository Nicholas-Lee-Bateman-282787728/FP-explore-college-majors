2099491,4,B0002J58FQ,"Ray Johnson was born in Detroit in 1927 and as an only child he was always focused on art and drawing.  Rather than attend regular school, he attend Cass Tech and studied art.  He want to an experimental college called Black Mountain where he was exposed to some of the leaders of the then avant garde.  He headed to New York in 1948 and became a part of the central art scene there.  He was admired by artists from many fields there and became friendly with many of them.

One of the very interesting things we learn in this film is that friendship is a very strange word when talking about Ray Johnson.  Everyone who knew him cared about him and had affection for him.  They all have stories about him.  However, Johnson never let anyone, that is ANYONE, into who he really was.  What that means is for you to decide.

He became a very fine and original collagist and even a performance artist.  Some of the stuff seems quite pointless and silly.  It probably is.  Not everything works in art.  However, the stuff that does is terrific.

Johnson never sold much and was difficult to work with.  Not because he had a band temper, but because he had his own views of reality.  A particularly nice story is a friend telling how he wanted to buy a collage he liked from Johnson who told him it was $2,000.  The friend offered $1,500.  Johnson said OK but that he would take it home and send it to him.  When he got it from Johnson it had the entire lower right quarter of the collage removed ($500 worth).

The movie is itself a kind of collage and quite interesting.  There is some footage of Johnson, many interviews with friends, and since Johnson's death is a mystery (probably a suicide as a performance piece) we also get an interview with the detective who looked into the death after the body was found floating in a river.

If you are interested in 20th century avant garde art and artists, you will likely find this film as interesting as I did.  If you don't appreciate the stuff, you still might find this a doorway into the stuff.  However, if artists drive you crazy you will probably not enjoy this at all because it is full of fascinating people you won't like.",1175212800,,2175,4.4045226130653266
2099492,5,B0002J58FQ,"Pop artist, prankster, and provocateur extraordinaire, Ray Johnson (1928-1995) had many acquaintances, but to a person no one claimed to know who he really was. His life, his death from suicide, and his prolific work were a single, seamless performance act. This documentary interviews curators, his agent, collectors, the police that investigated his death, his first cousin, fellow artists like Christo, and even, appropriately, his mail carrier (Johnson mailed thousands of pieces of his ""mail art"" to people around the world). The same semantic range of words emerges from them all -- enigmatic, elusive, isolated, underground, and mysterious. In one ""work"" he dropped sixty foot long hot dogs from a helicopter. In another, we see him hopping around on one foot as he beats a cardboard box with a belt. ""He kept so much of himself to himself,"" remarked one person. ""No one ever seemed to know what he did, or what he thought he was doing,"" observed another. But upon his death a veritable treasure trove of Johnson's work surfaced--paintings, drawings and especially mixed media collages pasted on the cardboard inserts of laundried shirts (he once told a friend he did ""chop art"" and not ""pop art""). The film, much of which is shot in black and white, begins and ends with consideration of his theatrical death on Friday, January 13th, 1995. His body was found floating under a bridge in Sag Harbor, New York, by buoy number 13. The night before Johnson had stayed in room #247 (= 13) of a motel. He was 67 (= 13). A few days later people discovered his house meticulously staged with transparent clues. Johnson was clearly an extraordinary and eccentric genius, once referred to in the The New York Times as the ""most famous unknown artist."" His works which spanned nearly 50 years are now exhibited in museums around the world.",1169596800,,1835,4.922580645161291
2099493,4,B0002J58FQ,"A fascinating look inside the New York art scene and the predecessor class to Warhol. I confess that I knew absolutely nothing about this artist before watching this documentary, and yet I couldn't get enough of it. Truly a man who lived his life as art. And his death? That's the central guessing game of this film, and it makes for a captivating and vaguely haunting biopic.",1135296000,7,376,4.626865671641791
2099494,4,B0002J58FQ,"The subject of this film is a lesser-known artist Ray Johnson, who was an extremely private person.  While he knew everyone in the New York pop art scene, no one knew him very well at all.

Moreover, in the documentary, at least, he seldom seems to sell a work of art, yet all he does is create art. He became a constant presence in the New York art scene from the early 1950's till his suicide in 1995. He is credited with creating the first happenings when he displayed his collages on a city street.  He began to concentrate on creating elaborate collages.

He is so shy about his art that even as his friends, maybe all his friends, get shows at well-known galleries and even at the Museum of Modern Art, he never allows MOMA's curators to judge whether to admit his works to the museum's collection. Instead, he mails his art to many friends, collectors and MOMA's library. The library, as is its custom, duly catalogs and keeps the mailed  art. In that way, he gets in the back door of the museum.

So when his friend Chuck Close wants a piece by Ray exhibited in Close's own exhibit at the museum, the MOMA library shows the ""mail art"" that Ray sent.

His address book is a Who's Who of modern art: Chuck Close, Roy Lichtenstein, Christo, Robert Rauschenberg, Willem de Kooning, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol.  All these artists knew and respected Ray Johnson and his work.

His house was a living space unfurnished except for shelves and shelves of his art works: small collages which he called moticos, drawings and paintings.

The film does not solve the puzzle of Ray Johnson, but it certainly presents what anyone knows of this oddly private artist. In fact, he was known as ""the most famous unknown artist in the world.""",1131321600,10,1729,4.548387096774194
2099495,1,B0002J58FQ,"Ray Johnson is a virtually unknown figure of the Pop Art scene and his story is filled with interesting figures from New York at the time. Additionally his suicide puts a tragic spin on his biography. I was disappointed though once I saw that 'How to Draw a Bunny' was not going to let the viewer at the information so easily. What you do get is interesting enough but it comes with an soundtrack consisting of drum riffs that is engineered at the same level as the interviews which proved to be very distracting. About 30 minutes into the film I realized that I had yet to see any of Johnson's work in the film. When it does appear it is quickly cut, cropped, or shown in bits.

'HTDAB' does not suffer from lack of information. After a while, I got the feeling that the filmmaker had almost too much information and interviews often stray off unrelated to each other. I was left to wonder why some anecdotes went on for five minutes while other more interesting ones were cut off to quickly.

At times too much of a 'personal touch' interferes with the film. Why for instance do we need to see a re-creation of a valentine xerox work of Johnson? Was the filmmaker concerned that it might serve to undermine the actual work? Its not too much of a shame...you get the point of the film -and Johnson's collage and xerox work- rather quickly but the details that are supposed to be the meat of any documentary are downplayed by the garnish.",1112745600,8,1438,4.443181818181818
2099496,3,B0002J58FQ,"Interesting look at enigmatic and isolated artist Ray Johnson.  HOW TO DRAW A BUNNY opens and closes with scenes shot at Sag Harbor, where Johnson died by drowning in 1997 in what the coroner ruled a suicide.  In between these scenes the movie, through interviews with a number of contemporaries and the use of old photographs and 8-mm home movies and videotapes, attempts to paint the portrait of the self-described ""Most Famous Unknown Artist in America.""

  I haven't any background in art history, and little talent for art appreciation, but I was intrigued by Johnson's feetings (collages built around line drawings of people's feet), moticos (the term he used for his collages), mailings, and videotapes of his performance pieces.  Concerned more with personality than events, the film doesn't give you a clear sense of Johnson's career - like, for instance, how he was able to support himself as an artist.  Who were his clients, etc?  Instead is included a number of interviews with friends and contemporaries.  Unfortunately, Johnson seems to have been unusually elusive and evasive, so even for those who were friends for decades the general consensus is ""I don't really know what he was like.""  Fair enough, but slim fodder to build a documentary on.

  I blush to admit it, but I rented this one solely on the basis of its title - I knew nothing about the artist and don't have an overwhelming curiosity about the art scene.  Although HOW TO DRAW A BUNNY didn't bowl me over, it didn't bore me, either.  The dvd also contains a commentary track with director John Walter and cinematographer Andrew Moore - okay without too much additional material.  There is also thirty minutes of outtakes and deleted scenes and a short, five-minute ""Ray Johnson Memorial Show"" video.",1100908800,6,1781,4.946127946127946
2099497,5,B0002J58FQ,"On Friday, January 13th, 1995, Ray Johnson checked into a Sag Harbor hotel, drove to the 7-11, then walked to the Sag Harbor Bridge, where he jumped to his death. This action, like most of his life, was foreshadowed by a number of clues, numerical coincidences and puns. When police entered his house, they found, among his belongings, a complex suicide note presented as a box full of small, beautiful collages. When they started investigating, the stories told by people who knew him each seemed to describe a different individual. This film is a quest to discover more about the mystery that was Ray.

I saw this film at Film Forum in NYC and it's criminal that it didn't receive wider distribution. Ray Johnson lived his life as a performance piece, improvising puns and jokes into everything he did. His artworks are complex zen riddles with punchlines, with collaged paper sanded like round rocks, all put together with elmer's glue. He was the eternal prankster, and the wonderful interviews relate many ""Ray stories"" from the likes of his art dealer, patrons and fellow artists (including Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Chuck Close, and Christo). Far from being someone who tried to become famous, he worked to avoid it, shunning publicity and pranking the art world, and mailing his work out for free to people around the world. I was one of those people.

The film is brilliantly assembled, hilarious at times, and absorbing... and the Max Roach score is a great bonus (complete with some footage of Max playing the drums). If you are interested in art and love a good story, this film is for you.",1100131200,17,1612,4.836956521739131

2099501,4,B0002J58FQ,"Strange, private and idiosyncratic artist Ray Johnson is quite the mystery. While Johnson appears to be somewhere near the center of New York's downtown art movement in the 1950s and 1960s, he shuns fame and it appears, even selling his work. Yet there he is, working away, creating a body of whimsical and highly appealing work that one imagines will only grow in influence over time. The filmmakers behind ""How To Draw A Bunny"" should be applauded for creating such a compelling film with so little archival and primary interview material to go on. Part mystery, part art biography, part portrait of the New York art scene in the time of Warhol, this film delivers a compelling and, before now, little-known story in a smart, honest and stylish way.",1297209600,,751,4.829457364341085
2099502,5,B0002J58FQ,"This is the best documentary on an artists I have ever seen, period. I had never heard of Ray Johnson before I watched this for the first time. Since then I have become a huge fan of the artists who died in 1993. I have watched this doc probably five times since i bought it and everytime I fing something new and great in it.

The interviews are great, especially the ones with Warhol Factory Photographer Billy Name. And the Footage of the artist is haunting, and full of drama and ambiguity. The work and ideas of the artits are fantastic and because of this documentary I have taken a huge interest in this him, but come to find that all books published on the artist are out of print, hard to find, and expensive!!! So for any Ray Johnson fans this is a staple, must have in your personal collection!!!

2099504,5,B0002J58FQ,"This is an fascinating documentary that I have watched countless times.  It is a very entertaining attempt to portray the art and life of the singular collage artist, Ray Johnson.  I describe this film as an ""attempt"" because no one really knew what made Ray Johnson tick.  He was one elusive individual.  To this day, no one knows what drove him, what inspired the incredibly quirky way his ran his life and art career or the motivation for his suicide by drowning in New York's Sag Harbor at the age of 67.

As a native New Yorker, I could not help but be nostalgic watching this documentary because it shows how artists in the 60s could comfortably live below poverty level, producing their art, commiserating with other artists in their community while enjoying New York City rents of well under a $100 a month.  Highly recommended.",1225238400,,836,4.691780821917808
2099505,2,B0002J58FQ,"Henry Darger. That is the name that hovers behind this 2002 documentary film, How To Draw A Bunny, by John Walter, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and details the life and wannabe legend of minor pop artist Ray Johnson (1927-1995). For those not in the know, Henry Darger was a hermit who, upon his death in the early 1970s, became a bit of a sensation when some bad artistes found and published excerpts from his lifelong continuing novel, with collages, about a make believe planet where naked girls with penises battled aliens who did not believe in Jesus Christ. The man's writing is uniformly terrible but, of course, the bad artistes that championed his work did so with such zeal that more mainstream and high profile artists, like singer-songwriter Natalie Merchant and poet John Ashbery, latched on to his brief flame of recognition by mentioning Darger in mediocre works of theirs.
  Naturally, Dargermania faded, for the truth is there was a very good reason Darger's fame was fleet. His work- both literarily and visually, sucked. This film tries to similarly hagiographize Johnson, by linking him with much better artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, who is one of many interviewees. Yet, like Darger, the bulk of Johnson's work was bad, really bad. Unlike Darger, however, Johnson- whose early 1995 suicide is treated as a mystery even if it seems utterly predictable given the man's narcissistic nature, actually had some artistic talent early on, even through some intriguing silhouette portraits. Of course, it dried up and Johnson went into collage- ala Darger, which even the most jaded of visual artists will be the first to admit is the genre that frauds inevitably turn to. Why? Because one can simply toss a bunch of random `found' things together, claim it art by fiat, and a bunch of clueless acolytes and sycophants, who merely `like' the artist personally, and know little of the creative process and art, will later rhapsodize about his `pushing of boundaries', or other such banal nonsense. Naturally, when that artist leaps off into creative nihility or bankruptcy he cannot push boundaries, for to do so one must be within the art form.
  In this regard, Johnson is well in line with frauds such as Jackson Pollock and the Abstract Expressionists, the LANGUAGE poets, and dozens of other earlier -isms and Schools, which tried to substitute creative bankruptcy with hipster posing of one sort or another. When the Johnson acolytes speak reverently of his suicide off a bridge as a piece of performance art they verge on self-parody. If Walter really wanted to focus on an artist of worth who jumped off a bridge, would not the poet and critic Weldon Kees, whose death truly is a mystery, have been a much better subject?.... Yet, it would take a great filmmaker to make such a trite life interesting. Johnson's idea of wit includes apothegms like, `Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow,' and his idea of `art' includes Xeroxed grotesques of bunnies with his artsy pals' names on them, and collages called moticos- which lack any of the inventiveness or savvy of contemporaries like Warhol or Lichtenstein. Johnson's idea of `political commentary' is images of celebrities as famous as James Dean and Elvis Presley, and as bizarre as Shelley Duvall- yet all adorned with Lucky Strike cigaret logos. The older he got the more seemingly demented and deluded he got. This is evidenced by such acts as letting a gullible acolyte videotape him doing nothing for several years, or dropping sixty foot long hot dogs over Riker's Island from a helicopter, or Magic Marking a cardboard box, then hopping about it on one foot while beating it with a belt. Of course, in the end, that old clich- the death obsession, got to him, as it does so many wannabe artists who really masque their mental ills with their pretensions.
  Still, his gay lover and friends, like artist Jean-Claude (wife of Christo- the noted `wrapper') ask such queries as why his work was not `recognized' with a straight face, even as she and the others all speak of how `nice' and `honest' a guy he was because they simply have no way to realistically declaim his `work' as having any real artistic value. Praising the person when speaking of an artist is always a giveaway as to the artist's lack of talent and accomplishment, much as is talking of the artist's `intent', rather than `accomplishment'. In this sense, Johnson was actually closer to a pre-Keith Haring Haring than a Henry Darger, much less an Andy Warhol- who, despite his persona, was an artist of- if not the first rank, certainly the second. Johnson was merely a mental case with some vague creative impulses, who never quite got his mental act together.
  The fact is, as mentioned earlier, that one cannot truly push an art's boundaries if one leaps wholly outside of it, and one's work has no real nor direct relation to its claimed art form. True originality comes only from within, and the multifarious ways that great artists use and reuse existing forms in new ways to achieve their ends. Simply put, Ray Johnson was neither good nor original. All that he did in his `art' was done before and better by others. That the same can be said of his documentarian's film may be a small synchronicity, but that's all it is. What it is not is art.",1221091200,2,5344,4.832786885245902
2099506,3,B0002J58FQ,"This is an interesting documentary on a fascinating subject, but I nearly had to stop watching several times because the music/drums on the soundtrack are completely irritating.  At one point I could barely hear the interviewee because the drums were so loud and distracting.  I wish I could watch this piece without the music soundtrack.",1193788800,,338,5.127272727272727
2099507,4,B0002J58FQ,"More than one person interviewed in this fascinating documentary states that no one really knew Ray Johnson.  The film certainly does nothing to dispel that notion.  Through interviews, archival footage, photos, and shots of his art, Johnson is presented as the ultimate man of mystery.  We get as great sense of what Johnson looked like simply because he seems to have loved being photographed and the film shows hundreds of photos taken of him by various friends.  Today, he might have put up a webcam in his living room so as to expand the number of viewers of his life.  And indeed, one of the suggestions of the film is that Johnson was always performing.  The most disturbing issue raised is whether Johnson drowned himself as part of a bizarre piece of performance art.  The film ends with no definite conclusion, but the possibility definitely looms in the end that he did.

Some other reviewers talk of whether the film will restore (enthrone?) Johnson among the pantheon of American artists.  I hope not.  I find pop art and the collagists interesting, but apart from Joseph Cornell, who was a major inspiration for them, I don't find many of them to be truly great artists.  Their actual works of art seem geared more toward starting conversations and debates than an actual engagement with their productions.  Nothing that I saw of Johnson's art made me feel that he was a major artist.  Interesting?  Yes.  Fascinating?  Indeed.  But his art is too opaque to enjoin the kind of interaction you can get from artists like Jasper Johns or Mark Rothko or the aforementioned Cornell.

Nonetheless, while I don't view Ray Johnson as a major artist he clearly was a well known figure among the New York art scene and it is clearly good to know more about him.  But if anything, rather than proving why Johnson was a major artist, I think the documentary shows why he was not.  He simply did not seem to connect emotionally with people.  He did not some across as warm or especially engaging.  In the video segments in which he appeared, he seems almost aggressive in keeping the viewer at arms length.  And the video scenes from his house at the end reinforce all this.  His home consisted of nothing but shelves holding an enormous number of items boxed up.  His books were not on shelves, but stacked on top of each other against walls.  He had no furniture to speak of and his walls largely devoid of artwork, strange for an artist.

In the end, Ray Johnson emerges as a unsolvable puzzle.  Did he kill himself as performance art?  I have no idea, though I would not dismiss the idea as impossible.  It does, however, make more sense than the simple suggestion that he committed suicide because he was unhappy.  But in the end, who knows?",1188864000,2,2747,4.660416666666666

So I kept sliding it down on the list (trust, mistrust) until, finally, I forgot to manage my list and it came to the house.  That can happen, as you know.
John Waters and Andrew Moore put together a film about the artist, Ray Johnson, that leaves you wondering which is better--Ray Johnson--or the movie? The answer is --both. Okay, Ray Johnson was, well, Ray Johnson. The movie is a Ray Johnson motico. On one level it plays as a retrospective of Ray's live and his art. On another level it plays out as a totally noir B detective movie. More like a noir detective documentary. (Remember Dragnet?) It's Dragnet in an exquisitly ""Ray"" way. Ray Johnson was not an outsider artist. He knew everyone in the arts, and everyone knew him. But in an important sense he was an outsider artist. He was outside of everything. Hilarious interviews with friends who tried to buy some of his art work. The negotiations over the sales became bigger than the art. And the art is stunning.
