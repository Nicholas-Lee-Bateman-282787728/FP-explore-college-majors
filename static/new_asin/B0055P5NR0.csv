4579205,5,B0055P5NR0,"I have a BA degree in music and have played guitar for a
lot of years.  I got the dvds and book... just got through the pentatonic
lesson.  It makes so much since now.  Never thought I'd be playing along
with Clapton, Hendrix, and CCR, too much fun.  Definately a huge next step in playing guitar.",1354752000,,297,4.25
4579206,3,B0055P5NR0,"These are not bad, a little slow, and a little remedial. If you know some Chords, Scales, and a little Theory you will want to look at something more challenging. If your a beginner, but know a few Chords, you'll pick up some good info here about how to utilize more of the fretboard. The Instructor is pleasant, and his Instruction is pretty sound. Im going to go through all these anyway as a brush up, and to grab a few thoughts and concepts, but for the most part an intermediate player will need something more advanced than this.",1329955200,3,535,4.414141414141414
4579207,5,B0055P5NR0,"I bought these DVDs (and the Fret board Theory Book) about 6 months ago directly from Desi's website.
I had played the guitar from the time I was twelve and finally gave after 23 years of not ever being able to learn to play at a level higher than strumming and trying to sing (you don't want to hear me sing).
18 months ago, I decided to give the guitar another try.
After doing some research, I decided to join JamPlay and start again at the beginning.
I spent a year on JamPlay trying to decide what type of music I wanted to play. (I knew strumming and singing weren't it). While JamPlay is an excellent service, I found that I was memorizing songs without really understanding anything about the 'Music'.
While sitting at the foot of my Friend in Kansas who actually skilled at making music, I learned thetas much of what he knew he learned from Desi, So I saved up my empty aluminum cans and took the plunge.
I started with the Pentatonic Scale DVD (the book helped me understand it) and before long I was playing licks I never thought I could.
The CAGED DVD was really interesting. Being able to move chords all around the neck instead of just playing in the open position. I had a lot of trouble fingering the Bar-C (the G was even harder) so when  I finally got that down, I was really proud.
I think my favorite DVD is the progressions. I learned how to play the 1 - 6 chords in Every key AND I learned a lot of songs in the process (my favorite is an Eric Clapton lick). I also know how to figure out what key a song I hear on the radio is in and I now can try to Play along. I came away with a lot of confidence and was having a lot of fun with my guitar now.
Finally, the Modes are really interesting and were pretty easy to understand. I hear that a lot of people say this is complicated advanced theory. Since this was my first exposure to the concept, I was amazed to find it pretty easy and straight forward (OK, the Greek names are scary)

Wish I had more time to comment, but I'm late for my dentist appointment.
Thanks Desi - you have increased both my knowledge and enjoyment.

8458521,5,B0055P5NR0,"Desi does a fantastic job of describing material AND linking it to music you will know.
In particular, his discussion of MODES is the best I've seen anywhere and you will understand them rapidly if you watch that DVD.
I wish this material was around when I was starting to learn guitar. It's great stuff.",1498435200,,304,4.545454545454546

8458524,4,B0055P5NR0,If you have his book these are a must have to go alone with it.,1423785600,,63,3.2666666666666666

8458526,5,B0055P5NR0,I have always enjoyed not just playing music but understanding music. This guitar theory bundle has helped to me to have a much greater understanding of what I am playing and then how to recognize and use what I have learned on other songs. I highly recommend these DVDs if you share my interest in not just learning songs or music but also learning the theory behind the music.,1399593600,,378,4.492753623188406
8458527,5,B0055P5NR0,"I really love Desi Serna's material.  It has explained things about the guitar that I have been wondering about for more than 30 years.  His material will really help you to understand music and the guitar and make the most of your playing time.  If you're looking to improve your play or are interested in how music is structured and put together, buy his stuff and listen to his pod casts.  I can't encourage use of his material enough.",1381536000,,438,4.506329113924051
8458528,5,B0055P5NR0,I purchased the MP3 formatted video lessons.  So far I am through the first one (Pentatonic) and partially through the 2nd (CAGED) videos.  Excellent instruction.  Very easy to understand and use while practicing on my guitar.  I would recommend to any beginner or even advanced user.,1364860800,,284,5.108695652173913
8458529,4,B0055P5NR0,I bought the Guitar Fretboard DVDs from Desi Serna and have found them to be extremely useful. I'm a beginner and have now been playing for a year and am able to play better than I thought that I would on my own. I have tried over the years learning guitar but always reach a plateau where I feel like I will never get past being a beginner. These DVDs have helped me quickly learn new songs and even create my own riffs by learning the 5 pentatonic patterns from the start. It has propelled me to stay interested in learning more. It's very exciting.,1360195200,,551,4.257142857142857
