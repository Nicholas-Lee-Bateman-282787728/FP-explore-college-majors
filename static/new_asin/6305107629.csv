8081314,5,6305107629,This was one of my favorite videos when I was little.  Watched it over and over again... and now my 3 year old is the same way!  Truly a classic!  We bring it out every Christmas season!,1197158400,,186,3.972972972972973
8081315,5,6305107629,"I used to watch this movie all the time when I was little. Granted, it's not a musical as it is listed, but I think it is one of the better renditions of the video.",1105228800,4,164,3.7142857142857144
8081316,1,6305107629,"The title of this video is very misleading.  In fact it does not say ""Musical"" anywhere on the packaging.  This is nothing more than Meryl Streep reading a childrens book with drawings on the screen and music in the background.  There is no ""Musical Performance"" and Amazon.com should not represent it at such.",1104883200,3,310,4.811320754716981
