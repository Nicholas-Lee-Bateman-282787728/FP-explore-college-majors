Its for the whole family...I saw some of my favorite friends from when I used to be on the show....that I have not seen in a long time. so much to see; it kept me entertained until the end.....I can't wait until the next party.....it was worth waiting for....finally, I can't believe there were so many original dancers there doing their thang, They really looked good out there.",1220313600,,459,4.348837209302325
8166841,1,B000M6QR04,I started looking at Soul Train in the early 70's. I thought I was going to see the dancers talk about their Soul Train experiences and see flashbacks from the show. This was awful..PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Children and former dancers are performing dance routines (badly). There's also a hideous dance show. Imagine if your ghetto classmates decided to have a prom reunion...this is much worst,1170806400,22,401,4.911764705882353
