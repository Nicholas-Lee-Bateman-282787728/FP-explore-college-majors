933947,5,6304826168,"I have loved black comedies all of my excistance. Not since the cult classic ""Heathers"", have I been so fascinated. Parker Posey will always be the It Girl in my indie world. Her portrayal as Jackie-O, the  neurotic and possesive twin sibling of Marty, played by Josh Hamilton, is  fabulous. Even though Jackie-O is disturbed, I found myself hoping, in some  twisted way that Marty would come to his senses and stay with her, and not  the dough-nut princess Lesly, played by Tori Spelling. I also must agree  that Tori Spelling also did a fabu job. ""The House Of Yes"" has  become my fav movie. Wishing in some psychotic way that I could be  Jackie-O.

If you sleep better at night because you enjoy a creepy, rambling character who thinks incest ( at a Rain man, fast pace) story and consider it to be art, there's something indisputably wrong with you.
I've never seen such a revolting movie that was so embraced by other's. The creep factor crosses over into the fandom that is positively nauseating and worrisome. I can't stress enough how truly( and literally) nauseating this film is. I physically felt my throat close as my gag reflex went into overdrive.

934234,3,6304826168,"A friend brought this movie to my house roughly ten years ago. My thoughts then were: this is this is twisted but funny. It has crips dialogue, ala Casablanca. Other's have pointed out that this is b/c it was a play first. Inside of this little tradgicomedy is a mystery: what happened to this family? At the core of the film is an incestuous relationship between a brother and sister. He returns to the family compound for Thanksgiving, bringing his new normal love into a whirlwind of insanity, hiding behind the guise of wealth and its affording protection.

  One must ask, where did the picture of their father go? The children don't seem to know. What did happen to the father? Not even the children seem to know. Meanwhile, the mother hovers like an apparition over the house, keeping watch over her damaged children. What does she know?

  Psychologists will tell you that incestuous behaviour is most often learned from a parent or adult, and then repeated. The film tells us that the two children began their relationship while very young. Did the father hurt Jackie-O? Her subsequent mental illness, and dissociative states, point to serious childhood trauma. Perhaps the worst kind. As the brother seems to be free of this anguish, i think the evidence points to the victim being solely Jackie, who then repeats the behaviour with her brother.

  You might not believe it, but this sort of abuse is just as common in elite circles as it is in the lowest. Did the mother murder the father for retribution? This may explain why she is so indulgent with jackie. She also seems to think her children are beyond repair, as she shows by chiding the returning brother for trying to be normal; and betrays an old world snobbery as she makes fun of her son's 'donut shop girl.' In short, she is both mother hen and bird of prey.

  Beneath the veneer of comedy there is a serious black hole in the heart of this story. It teaches about the insular protection of wealth, and the presumption of untouchability in the elite classes. If there is a redemptive moment in this story, it's the unconditional love 'the donut girl' shows the matriarch's son, who escapes the cycle of incest, that is so often generational. It's a shame Jackie is painted as a villian in the end. She's a victim in her madness. This film is like a wreck that you can't look away from. And like Jackie's mind, it is fractured into different personalities, and neither seems to be aware of the others.",1331856000,,2474,4.64908256880734

I, on the other hand, watch this movie over and over again.  It's Parker Posey's finest performance and is stuffed full of quotable, hysterical one-liners.  My humor tends to fall on the sarcastic side, so this movie was made specifically for people like me.

It really is a wonderful, hilarious film for people who ""get"" this style of humor.  But that will be key in enjoying it.  If you're not the kind of person who can sit for 2 hours listening to banter and being fully engaged and entertained, than this isn't the movie for you.

934295,2,6304826168,"THE HOUSE OF YES is based on a stage play, and although I've never seen a production or read the script...the movie sure felt an awful lot like a play that did not have its script ""opened up for the screen.""  It felt very theatrical...almost to the point where it felt like a deliberate choice to have this movie feel like a play.  If that's the case, it was NOT a good choice.

THE HOUSE OF YES deals with a very messed up, upper class family who happen to live within shouting distance of the Kennedy compound.  Set a few years after John Kennedy's assassination, we meet the Pascal family, including mother (Genevieve Bujold) and her three kids:  young Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.), ""Jackie-O"" (Parker Posey) and her brother Marty (Josh Hamilton).  Set during part of Thanksgiving weekend, Marty is bringing his fianc Lesly (Tori Spelling) to meet his family.  Anthony is a social shut-in of some sort...he's a young man who ought to be in college or something, but he appears to be terribly nave and flighty.  Jackie-O (her real name is not given, from what I could hear) is nuts.  She dresses like Jackie-O and virtually imagines herself to BE Jackie, and she further imagines that her brother Marty is John.  She CLEARLY has an unhealthy attachment not only to her fantasies but to her brother.  Could there be incest in their past?  Marty seems to be fairly normal, but he slips into old, poorly adjusted patterns pretty quickly.  Poor Lesly is just a mid-western girl, slightly simple...and is quickly overwhelmed by the weirdness around her.  And Mother (also not named) is no help at all...she acts like the matriarch of a fine, tradition-steeped family, having rationalized the fact that all her kids are basket cases.

The film is sometimes called a comedy...but truthfully, it is more odd & quirky than funny.  At first, the odd behavior of this family seems almost quaint and amusing...but as it becomes clearer that they are ALL messed up (including ""normal"" Marty); it grows harder to keep much interest in these folks.  They are given to histrionics and huge theatricality of speech and gesture...and this is REALLY annoying to watch.

The script includes bad behavior, seductions that are quite sordid, lots of yelling & drinking and enormous amounts of dialogue that indicates how nuts these people are.  It's almost as if they are all aware they are crazy and are trying to outdo each other.

This might be tolerable if the cast were better.  But just as the script hasn't been allowed to open this story up (we never really even see the outside of the house)...the actors have apparently been encouraged to perform as though they were onstage.  All are allowed to exaggerate greatly, and most do not have the skill to pull this off.  If you've ever wanted to know what an evening at the theatre starring Tori Spelling and Freddie Prinze Jr. might be like...wonder no more.  It's an evening that includes not one single believable emotional moment.  Spelling acts like a dumb blonde...in the worst possible way.  Prinze just looks like a lost puppy.  Hamilton starts out okay, but as his character falls under the old thrall of his family, he allows himself to wallow in ""Acting"" with a capital ""A.""  Bujold, in many ways, comes off the best...but her character really goes through no growth or change, so in the end, her role is mostly relegated to the sidelines.  And the usually wonderful Parker Posey is allowed to go right over the top.  She's got energy to burn, and her role gives her very little in the way of realistic shadings.  She bounces all over the place (per the script), and none of it seems rooted in an underlying reality.  I can't decide if it is her fault or the fault of the director & script.  Regardless, she flails about with great verve...but it's all sound and fury signifying nothing.

By the time HOUSE OF YES reaches its final scenes, we're just tired and bored and ready for it to be over.  I was left feeling that I had spent nearly two hours with a bunch of horrible people, doing stupid, petty little things and that it all culminated in total meaninglessness.  There was no deeper point to be made, and even the journey there was not worth taking.  This is truly a HOUSE OF NO.",1272844800,4,4232,4.677943166441136

Well, it would have worked if I had cared about a single character. Unfortunately, every character is extremely one-dimensional and the acting reflects that perfectly. Also, the nuances about the timing of the assassination and the death of the father would have worked if I HAD CARED. But the director lost me at the first forty minutes.

934301,3,6304826168,"The House Of Yes (horrible title!) is a bizarre, dark comedy with much to like, and dislike - ultimately it feels like an interminable, one-gadget shaggy dog story.

The plot is loopy; suspension of disbelief is one thing, dumb is another.  (Why is it that criminal insanity among society's elite seems somehow reasonable to audiences, and excuses shabby construction?)

A wealthy and oddly detached widow has raised her twins, (one male, one female), and their dimwitted half-brother, in an elegant, stately home. The woman is unapologetically vague about the fathers of these children, except to say they were definitely not her late husband.  The twins are inappropriately close, even for twins.  The girl, who may have killed the father, has an obsession with Jackie-O.  The boy twin, attempting to flee this unholy dynamic, has brought his fiancee to ""meet the family.""  The girl twin is pathologically threatened, causing her insanity to kick up a few notches.

This synopsis may sound far-fetched but it barely scratches the surface.  Happily there are some splendid performances and snappy dialogue.  Parker Posey is downright brilliant as Jackie-O, an extreme part she might easily have overdone.  Posey gets many of the best lines and delivers them with a chilling combination of intelligence, madness, malice, and terror.

Tori Spelling is a pleasant surprise.  As ""the outsider"" who wanders into an unsafe, horrific world, she adroitly brings a sweet rationality that is both much needed and overmatched.  Also delightful to see Genevieve Bujold, whose smooth performance is so assured it almost makes this absurd environment seem believable.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Josh Hamilton struggle with two-dimensional roles.

The film suffers from ""Glengarry Glen Ross Syndrome,"" it's based on a play, (Wendy MacLeod), action (such as it is) occurs in one setting, and it's entirely dialogue-driven.  But in Glengarry Glen Ross you had memorable characters, an interesting situation, spellbinding dialogue, and Mamet did the film adaptation.  In THOY you have cardboard characters, ridiculous situations, dialogue that ricochets between witty and ploddingly pompous, and director Mark Waters did the screen adaptation.

I love dark comedy, and I feel like this movie was dark enough to suite my tastes, but not so dark that I felt uncomfortable, which is a fine line.  This isn't a laugh-out-loud movie (though I did laugh audibly), but more of a ""He he"" movie (if that makes sense)...  I haven't seen/read the play, so I can't comment on how closely it matched or if it was what I expected, but I do want to see it performed now!!

Parker Posey does an amazing job as ""Jackie-O"" in this movie - it would have been pretty easy to be drastically over-the-top in this role, but Posey goes just over-the-top enough to play the role to a T.  I thought Freddie Prince Jr. and Tori Spelling did a great job as well.  Their roles didn't lend themselves to be done ""well"" (in a thespian sort of way), but they didn't take themselves too seriously, which made the characters funny.  It was great to see them branch out.",1135468800,4,1098,4.348039215686274
934303,5,6304826168,"Every once in awhile a cast comes together which actually does justice to what was already a wonderfully comedie noir script. The House of Yes is exactly that movie.

To overly simplify the plotline, there once were two twins. They had a sexual (read: incestual) relationship. One decided to be normal and left for the big city. He came out closer to normal. The other decided to stay behind. She went crazy. Their younger brother is none-too-bright. Their mother doesn't know if all her children are from the same man.

When the male twin returns home with his new fiancee for Thanksgiving, everything falls apart. Oh, did I mention they have an obsession with the Kennedy's?

This is not a Sinbad-style gag movie. This is a dark, funny movie. The casting was perfect. Parker Posey portrays perfectly (absent alliteration) a semi-psychotic woman who evinces both lunacy and feline lethality. Josh Hamilton is all the more disturbing for the degree of normalcy he brings to the role of Marty. Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the part he was born to: a half-witted simpleton. Tori Spelling plays the part SHE was born to: a half-witted simpleton who is actually more clueless than Freddie. Genevieve Bujold tops it all off with her disinterested matriarch character who -- after examing the situation -- casually notes that ''Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to baste the turkey and hide the kitchen knives.''

I leave you with two sets of quotes that should give you a taste for the dialoge, and let me state for the record that there is not one word in this film that doesn't have a joke or hidden subtext to it. It may be the best-written movie ever.

934363,3,6304826168,"Parker Posey is one of the most talented actresses I've seen in film comedies.  She shines in this movie, but nobody else does.  It seems strange to have Freddie Prinsze Jr. and Tori Spelling in a film that looks like it's trying to stay close to its theatrical origin.  The script is compelling but unfortunately the performances don't convey the immediacy of a dramatic stage production.  I kept watching for the ""deus ex machina"" to lift this from the rut it stays in.  I'll watch it again; maybe I'll like it a little more after that.  If you like good writing, you may like it despite the co-stars' stiff and one-demensional deliveries.",1126137600,,641,4.678571428571429
934364,4,6304826168,"The credits of ""The House of Yes"" take us back and forth from black & white film of Jackie Kennedy giving her famous televised tour of the White House and color home movies of a young girl (Rachel Leigh Cook) dressed like Jackie and providing a similar tour of her own home. We quickly learn that the night JFK was shot, the father of the young girl and her unseen twin brother behind the camera, disappeared. In the present the young girl, known as Jackie-O (Parker Posey) has recently returned from a mental institution and is excited that her twin brother Marty (Josh Hamilton) is returning home for Thanksgiving in 1983. Unfortunately Marty has brought home a fianc?, Lesly (Tori Spelling), and this does nothing good for Jackie-O's sanity. All her mother (Genevi?ve Bujold) can do is ""baste the turkey and hide the kitchen knives.""

 The problem is that Jackie and Marty are very close twins. Their mother explains to Lesly that that when they emerged from the womb Jackie was holding on to Marty's penis and as this film develops we learn she still has a rather unhealthy attachment to both it and him. Throw into the mix another brother, Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who takes a liking to Lesly and there is just no end to how badly this Thanksgiving can go. At one point Anthony explains to Lesly that she is the first guest ever to spend the night in the house, which should be enough to send her fleeing from the Pascual residence, but that comes later.

 The Pascuals are one of those unhappy families that is unhappy in a peculiarly sick little way. The opening credits inform us that ""The House of Yes"" was based on a play by Wendy MacLeod and as soon as the dialogue begins you certainly hear the staginess of the words. But it makes sense to me that this story of twins obsessed with incest and the Kennedy assassination was originally a play, because the black comedy probably worked even better in that context. The humor here is warped, to say the least, but the cast is in fine former and makes it easier for us to laugh.

 Posey is the star of the show (her performance received special recognition for acting at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival), gleefully enjoying Jackie-O's insanity, starting with her frantic response to Marty's introduction of Lesly as his fianc?. The only one who can go toe to toe with her is Marty, which probably explains why he is so important to her. It is why he continues to act out the JFK assassination with her and get physical that remains a mystery. Prinze turns in a performance that makes me think of a mellower Anthony Perkins, while Bujold keeps urging everybody to just jump ahead to the obvious ending, where Lesly goes away so that Marty and Jackie-O can apparently live happily ever after. Even the casting of Spelling works in this case, although undoubtedly a big surprise to the many who cast aspirations on her acting career.

 ""The House of Yes"" will not be to everyone's taste, but that is what happens when you combine incest and the Kennedy assassination. The situation is surreal enough that you do not take it seriously, but you can still understand why some people are going to give up on this one early on or not even start it once they know what it is about. As a play I would have associated this with some of those I saw during the 1970s, which is why I am probably open to this sort of storyline: I have seen stranger and weirder things. But if you watch ""The House of Yes"" what you are going to remember in the end are the performances and not the plot.",1091318400,6,3533,4.517996870109546

It's probably the best dark comedy I've ever seen (only to rival the masterpiece that is ""Heathers"").  The dialog in this movie with leave you with one-liners for years to come.  After seeing ""Party Girl"" I fell in love with Parker Posey, and when I saw this I loved her even more. This instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time, but then again I'm a huge fan of good dark comedies and I have a sick sense of humor.

I enjoyed Parker Posey's portrayl of a mentally-unbalanced woman who impersonates Jackie O. that cannot escape the feelings of oneness and amorous love for her twin brother.  It is a smart, sassy look at dysfunction, but dysfunction from a surrealist point of view.  Tori Spelling's acting is terrible, as I wanted Jackie O. to kill her and be done with it all.  Yes, there isn't enough underlying ""tension"" between the characters and what's at stake is marginal at best, but for 85 minutes, the dialog and interesting story line will set you spinning.",1084060800,,815,4.927007299270073

Bujold as the matriarch shows a droll comic side that I have never seen in her before and it is perfect with the dialogue she has. ""Talk?  Why would we want to do that, it only leads to trouble.""  A scene where she is trying to ship Tori Spelling off in a cab is hysterical.
Tori Spelling does a good job as the naive Donut Queen who has no clue what she just walked into.  I mean the poor girl grew up eating pancakes.  Even Freddie Prinze Jr. does not do badly.
Yeah the plot is sick: incest, assasinations, mental instability, jealousy and denial.  But mixed up with this cast it is very, very funny. Strange and wonderful if you are the dark humor type.",1055548800,15,910,4.317647058823529

""Marty and Jackie were playing French Revolution, and they made me be Marie Antoinette."") The family is definitely different, and Genevieve Bujold gives a real star turn as the mother who holds it all together; or perhaps who tears it all apart (""Were you spying on us?"" ""A mother doesn't spy; a mother pays attention."")
This is humor with an edge though, and it's definitely not for everyone. If the thought of Doris as an intelligent, bubbly, mentally ill person who's a little too intimate with her brother bothers you, you won't like it. If you're from New York, though, you probably will. I generally don't like movies where people are gratuitously mean to an innocent, but Tori Spelling's character is such a hick that Posey's relentless nastiness somehow seems appropriate.
Anyway, if you're the sort of person who prefers to tread off the beaten path, you'll like this movie; it's very good. If you're pretty conventional, you probably won't.",1031875200,,1103,4.810526315789474

934371,3,6304826168,"Reading through many of these reviews, I think there's been a tendency to take an extreme. Some have said it was simply brilliant, others have said it was terrifically horrible. I don't think either should be said.
First off, it's true that this film takes you to the very boundaries of decency, and then actually beyond those boundaries. And some of it may well be done in poor taste, but the taboo and the Kennedy scenes shouldn't destory one's opinion of this flick. The House of Yes really requires the viewer to suspend preconcieved notions of incest and JFK for a couple hours and just view it for what it is. It's not making a statement about JFK, and it isn't really taking a side regarding incest either. To let these controversial topics influence our opinion of this film is to judge the work on something it isn't. That's hardly fair.
What is this movie? It's an inspection of all of the different characters. It looks at how incest, distant parenting, mental illness, a new, somewhat covered up love affair affects a family unit as a unit as well as as individuals. It is on these themes that the movie should be judged. That isn't to say the film is without problems; it has plently. Many of the themes are under-examined and underdeveloped. The screenwriting (while quite witty) is choppy and contrived at times. The audio track doesn't add to the film. And the lighting isn't very inventive.
But with all of that said, there are a lot of positives as well. The acting, by all of the performers, is spectacular. That includes Prinze Jr and Spelling, neither of whom I typically enjoy. The actors seem to feel their characters and perform their roles exceptionally. Especially Posey and her mother, who literally seem to BE their characters. There are, in fact, many terrific, quotable lines, at least one delivered by all of the actors.
Ultimately, what I'm saying is to judge this film for what it is, not what it isn't. What it is is an average independent film with some very compelling performances. Period.",1020902400,3,2026,4.709859154929577
934372,3,6304826168,"I rented this movie just because it had Parker Posey in it, and looked like a funny dark comedy.  Boy, was I suprised.  Not only did I laugh one single time in it, but it was very bizzare.  No movie I have ever seen has gone to those extremes with incest and other issues like that.  The whole movie is set in a Washington Home, with a resemblance to John F. Kennedy.  It is adapted from a play, so i guess thats why there is so much dialogue with so little action throughout the whole movie.  It is definately one of the darkest films i have ever seen, and definately qualifies itself as a true indie.  Parker Posey's role is great, i don't think anyone could have played it better, while a young Freddie Prinze Jr. plays her little brother, well, he couldn't possibly be any worse in the movie.  It is pretty slowgoing but keeps your attention for the most part, and if you are looking for a bizzare dark ""comedy"" (although thats not what i would call it) check this one out.  I still think it could have been done better, although there were superb performances by 4 of the 5 characters in the movie.

Posey is her neurotic self as the mentally unstable Jackie O, whose unnatural love for her brother sends her over the edge of sanity.

He has not been home for years, and his mother nurtures the unnatural, sexual relationship between brother and sister. Posey instantly dislikes Tori so much that she goes out of her way to berate, insult, and undermine her at every turn without her brother interceding  and all against the background of a dark, stormy night (a cliched movie theme).

Freddie Prinze Jr. does a great job at playing a guy that seems clueless, and the Mother is hysterically floating about her own little version of the world. I normally can't stand Tori Spelling, but she wasn't unbearable in this movie, and it's absolutely wonderful to see Jackie O's interactions with her character.

Be forewarned it has themes that may not appeal to all, but it's definitely worth a look.

We hope against hope that our relatives will somehow be on their best behavior  and that we'll all survive the weekend, which we inevitably do.
Of  course, when your family is as odd as that depicted in ""The House of  Yes"", a feeling of dread is well-founded.
When your mother reminds  people of Morticia Addams, throwing out horrid family secrets along with  tips on how to properly make muffins, or your brother wants to settle  adolescent scores by making a pass at your girlfriend, or (best yet) your  twin sister (with whom you engaged in a not-so-youthful indiscretion)  thinks she's Jackie Kennedy circa 1963, the whole enterprise of a holiday  weekend is a risky undertaking at best.
Tori Spelling seeks indie cred  here as the erstwhile fiance, all peaches-and-cream innocence slapped up  against the most dysfunctional family caught on film since the Rose Garden  tapes of the Clintons.  Josh Hamilton and Mark Waters play the brothers who  can't seem to let the past remain in the past, while Parker Posey radiates  as the lunatic sister who doesn't even realize the past IS the past.
This is black comedy par excellance, although the subject matter may  make those few raised in a Cleaveresque household squeamish.

It's Thanksgiving 1983 in a wealthy suburb of Washington D.C. and  the Pascal family, an affluent French-American family is preparing for the  traditional festivities. The problem is that nothing is carried out  according to tradition in this house or within the dysfunctional family  which it houses. Mommy Pascal isn't sure of the paternity of any of her  children, or what quite happened to her late husband. The boys are, well,  boys, and the daughter in the family has a rather malicious mean streak to  her, despite being a gracious hostess. She's also under the impression that  she and her twin brother are destined to share absolutely everything in  life (everything!) and is so fixated with the Kennedy family that she is  affectionately known in the Family as Jackie-O, a fantasy that she carries  out disturbingly flawlessly, thanks to a collection of Oleg Cassini in her  wardrobe, pearls and hair that would've made Mrs. O. herself a little  envious. She is also so psychotically funny that you cannot help but to  start quoting her once the lights go up and the credits come down. She also  does a top-notch of dealing with the fiancee of the man she loves...her own  twin brother.

934507,5,6304826168,"ANYONE who enjoys Parker Posey films will swoon for this one.  She reaches her pinnacle of idiosyncrasy here, and no price tag can be put on that.  Irony abounds (the family invalid happens to be able to outwit all other  characters).  Parker talking down to Tori is hysterical, and one can't help  but imagine how easily that could happen between the two real-life  actresses.",946166400,2,377,4.8125
934508,5,6304826168,"Dark and extremely clever- this is Parker's greatest film to date.  A brilliant script followed by superb deliverance, this movie can not be  type-cast. Tory Spelling's embarrassing acting only adds to viewing  pleasure.",941068800,2,220,5.606060606060606
934509,5,6304826168,"GREAT movie. This and 'Party Girl' (another Parker Posey film) are two of my favorite movies. Let's see... well, I guess I like this film because it's unique, and there is a lot of very very good dialuoge. Dialouge. Dialog. That was wise.  ;)  Yeah well, it would help if I could spell or if this box had a spell check. Hehe. Not a comb, a brush!  A brush you brush your hair with!  Anyway where was I... Oh yeah! House of yes. I have seen this movie a zillion times and never get sick of it.  Pretend he's not my brother, I do.  :)  [you have to be able to see past the incest-theme throughout the movie]  And although I do not condone the use of Tori Spelling in movies (I have no doubt her Daddy was the only reason she got this role), I have made an exception for this fine film.  I guess now on her resume, she can put that she was the Doughnut Queen in House Of Yes.  Haha.  So if you enjoy black comedies, plays, Parker Posey, good DIALOGUE (see, I can spell after all! I had a short memory lapse there...it is 17 minutes (and exactly 37 seconds) after 4am right now you know...give me a break!). Or if you enjoy independent films of any sort, I would tell you to watch this movie. But I'm just some crazy person, so you don't have to listen to me... I'm just throwing this review out there incase anyone is interested. Bubbles! No bubbles! Stop Giving me the 3rd Degree!!  Hehehehe....

7878230,5,6304826168,Love this movie! Parker Posey does one hell of a job acting crazy! It's not for kids by any means due to it's pretty dark topic (incest). But good for an interesting and entertaining night of weirdness....,1514678400,,205,4.5675675675675675

7878232,5,6304826168,"I've rented this so many times I probably could have purchased three DVDs at full price. Finally bought the stream and watched it again. I can't get enough of this movie. Parker Posey is truly amazing and she absolutely steals the show.

Everyone else is great and the casting is perfect. Perfect writing, perfect editing. It's amazing that a movie can feel so small and so completely enveloping at the same time. I don't know if almost all of the film was actually shot in a single house, but it feels like it. And keeping the cast small (and cutting the power!) makes everything so close and intimate.

There are no distractions in this film. The acting and writing had to be amazing...and they are. Everyone nailed it. Could not be better.",1501891200,,742,4.613636363636363
7878233,3,6304826168,"Parker Posey is the best part about this movie, Freddy Prinze Jr. is good as well.  After finding out the secret I no longer cared about the characters or what happened to them.  I think the twin brother and Tori Spelling may have been miscast as they seem weak but I guess that may be the point.  What's the deal with the matronly dress Tori wears to dinner, so not flattering in any way. I don't understand how a woman can pledge undying love for someone then sleep with their brother and get mad at her fiance when she learns his big secret.",1499731200,,544,4.262135922330097
