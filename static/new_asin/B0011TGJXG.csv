8242261,3,B0011TGJXG,"I love Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and all the Supremes, but how many times must their story be told?  Mary has always been my favorite Supreme, but she is overweight these days and doesn't look or dress Supreme. The wigs look cheap and the dresses are way too tight for her frame.  What happened to my svelte sexy Supreme? Only her voice has improved with age. Her latest CD recorded live at the Empire Plush Room in San Francisco's York Hotel is simply superb, but only Diana has maintained her Supreme girl figure (while still using way too much make-up!)...the sign of a true Diva Supreme.",1232496000,,590,4.556603773584905
8242262,2,B0011TGJXG,"I purchased this video because I am a collector of anything dealing with the supremes, however, I was very disappointed with this addition.  I would suggest you wait till the price is $5.00 to purchase this DVD.  I was truly excited when it came in the mail.  I rushed home, put it in the player and before a blink of the eye, it was over!!  The actual interview with Mary is like only 15 long, if 15 minutes.  There are only two short inserts of Diana and the supremes performing.  So short unless you pay real good attention to detail, you would be unable to remember much about the performance.  I thought when I purchased this DVD there would have been some segments of the group together doing a couple of entire songs, and a true interview at least 45 minutes long or 60 minutes.  I must say I am truly disappointed for the money I invested in the DVD. The only thing positive about it was that Mary was very candid, very real and honest with her remarks.",1231459200,2,961,4.329608938547486
8242263,5,B0011TGJXG,"I just want to start off by saying thank you.  The interview with Mary Wilson was not only informative, insightful and a great insight into a living legend, but it helped to make my mothers mothers day a day to remember.  My mother has been a long time Supremes fan and with mothers day approaching I found your DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PROFILES-featuring-Mary-Wilson/dp/B0011TGJXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PROFILES featuring Mary Wilson</a>&nbsp;and thought it would be a perfect gift for her and for her collection.  The family all sat around and watched one of the most soulful interviews we've ever seen.  It was a great way to bring not only the family together but a huge smile on my mothers face.  For this I am extremely great full and will be sure to come back and find the perfect fathers day gift.  Thanks for helping to start a family tradition!",1210809600,,914,5.356643356643357
8242264,5,B0011TGJXG,"After watching this interview it became clear why Mary Wilson and the Supremes inspired people such as Oprah Winfry and Brack Obama to believe they too could achieve great things!. As a long time Supremes fan this DVD offered new information such as what happened to the most recent attempt at a Supremes reunion tour?, and what ever happened to all those beautiful Supremes gowns?

My Supremes collection would not have been complete without this rare interview with Mary Wilson.",1205971200,4,480,5.0
8242265,1,B0011TGJXG,Dont bother with this if you already know who Mary is. There is nothing new other than standard questions and answers.,1204934400,,118,4.666666666666667
8242266,5,B0011TGJXG,"I've been a long time Supremes fan, but I don't get to see Mary in many interviews these days... so this was definitely a great find! It was wonderful to see Mary still looking so beautiful in her sixties and being her charming, witty and direct self. The host was able to ask her great questions and she in turn gave surprisingly candid responses! Seeing Mary and hearing her stories reminded me of why The Supremes were such an inspiration to so many people. I also found out a few things about what she's been up to lately. This video was surely worth every penny.",1203465600,9,567,4.40952380952381
8242267,4,B0011TGJXG,"I enjoyed this DVD.  Mary is always at her best and truly very honest! She is a genuine person. She speaks of herself, future plans, family,The Supremes and her recent college degree.  I met Mary in Las Vegas and actually sung on stage with her.  I fortunate to be selected from the audience.  If you are a Mary die-hard fan, I would recommend you,to buy the DVD. By the way, she does not sing on the video. Maybe, she will do a part II.",1202515200,7,437,4.166666666666667
8242268,1,B0011TGJXG,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!  Sorry, Mary, but unless you are a REAL die-hard fan of Mary Wilson, or of the Supremes, this DVD is a waste of money.  I didn't even want to give it one star, but I was forced to give it a rating just to get this info to you.  22 minutes of Mary Wilson talking about stuff we've already heard or read about her and the Supremes.  There are a couple of PARTIAL clips of the Supremes singing old tunes, but if you have other videos or DVDs of their performances, then this is no exceptional addition to your collection.  Mary talks about herself being 63 years old and ""looking good"" for her age; the interviewer isn't that well-versed in the Supremes' history, so he is constantly referring to his notes; and each of them interrupt each other continuosly.",1202169600,5,775,4.429577464788732
