5058393,4,B0076QS2OM,"I'm finally getting around to doing the review for this item. This was a season I watched on TV while it was in syndication and I did enjoy it back then. I was happy when this series came out on DVD and I plan on getting each season. I am now finished with Season 3. I did enjoy this season. I'm certain it is widely known about the bad packaging which is why I'm giving four stars. The episodes do rate five stars and I enjoyed watching them again.
All the episodes are good but space will not allow me to describe each episode. Here are some that stand out:

* Streams of Consciousness: The human race is connected to an entity called The Stream-the Internet on steroids. This is done by a neural implant that allows a direct connection to all human knowledge. This has made all reading material obsolete. One young man cannot access The Stream due to a brain injury and is looked down by others. But as with all machines things go wrong. The Stream attempts to obtain all bits of information no matter how useless. This could destroy the human race. It is this young man who not connected to The Stream that saves mankind.

* Dark Rain: A chemical war leaves humanity unable to produce children. Only rare couples can have normal, healthy children. One such couple does conceive and this gets intense attention from the government. The couple is taken to a government hospital to see the pregnancy through. The woman gives birth to a healthy baby. In typical government fashion the couple is lied to by the government official in charge. The couple is assisted by a group working against the government (I love it when common people pull one on over the government) and the couple is taken to an isolated area where it is revealed healthy children are being born.

* Feasibility Study: A group of humans are abducted by aliens to determine if the human race is suitable to serve as slaves. One in the group contracts a disease from another alien race and the disease is spread by contact with the infected individual. When the abducted group catches on to whats happening and why, they sacrifice themselves to keep mankind from being enslaved. They do this by allowing the disease that infected the one to infect themselves.

* A Special Edition: Best episode of Season 3. A reporter finds that the government and defense contractors have been secretly cloning humans. Anyone can be cloned. The reporter attempts to report this but in the end is overcome by government forces. This episode flashbacks to previous episodes and to one episode not yet broadcasted.

Those are the good ones. Again I want to say that Amazon did its usual good job in getting the item to me in a timely manner. In spite of the bad packaging the discs did play with no problems and the picture was of good quality. I used the fee free Super Saver shipping and it arrive in a little over a week. again good job and thanks.",1335312000,7,2901,4.539196940726577
5058394,1,B0076QS2OM,This not the series from Showtime don't buy this Its the Canada edited version the only American version of this series is season 1 and is not edited i'm hoping Time life or some other company comes out with the full versions of these shows. Because the series is awesome. I will be waiting till then.,1325203200,16,301,4.392857142857143
5058395,5,B0076QS2OM,"This is an excellent show, I bought all the seasons. Unfortunately the DVD packaging from Canada is absolutely useless and damaging to the DVDs. The majority of the DVD sets arrived with DVDs loose and damaged. I have a machine that resurfaces the DVDs and that is what I had to do with many of them. I now have them in individual sleeves so the damage will not continue to happen. Since only season 1 has been released in the US and a compilation set was released as well, I had no choice but to order the Canadian releases. I am glad I did even though I had to do some disc restoring. If you can fix your DVDs I would recommend getting this series in its entirety.",1321056000,7,666,4.2109375
5058396,5,B0076QS2OM,"Yes, 3 thru 7 have been censored; but these alterations are not really cuts and they do not affect the content of the shows in any way. It's all done seamlessly, painstakingly. An outstanding accomplishment by someone who really cared and obviously knew what they were doing.  AND: Technically, the picture and surround sound are excellent. If you compare the season sets 3 - 7 with the early MGM issues, you'll see what a remarkable, subtle job they did with these transfers. Sure, I'm as much of a FilmPurist as the next guy, but I'm very pleased to have the entire 7 seasons. A great show...",1313452800,2,594,4.60377358490566
5058397,3,B0076QS2OM,"I agree with other reviewers of these Complete Season Outer Limits box sets that this has to be the worst designed packaging I have ever seen for holding DVDs. I rate the episodes 4-stars. I would have rated the episodes 5-stars - except Canadian Home Video censored them to remove the occasional female bare breast that was shown in the MGM releases. Actually, the boxes all these Canadian Home Video DVDs came in rates 0-stars, so I am giving this product an overall rating of 3-stars.

The Complete 2nd Season of Outer Limits put out by Canadian Home Video is uncensored, but seasons 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 put out by Canadian Home Video were all censored to remove rough language & every brief trace of nudity. Anyone who wants to see at least some of the uncensored episodes in these seasons must buy the various ""theme"" collections put out by MGM. All of the MGM ""theme"" releases are uncensored. I purchased the MGM Complete 1st Season, & it is also uncensored.

Now more on the awful Canadian boxes. To keep from scratching the Outer Limits DVDs trying to remove them from their boxes, or while putting them back in, I found the best way is to put all the DVDs into an empty ""spindle"" box that had originally held blank CDs or DVDs.

I bought all 6 of the Canadian Home Video sets (Seasons two thru seven), dumped the boxes, & put all the Outer Limits DVDs (in order) into an empty spindle box that I had originally bought from Staples & that had held 40 blank DVD+RW discs. Now I can easily lift out any year & episode I want to watch, without having to fight the stupid little plastic clips holding each DVD in its Canadian box. The season number, disk number, & episode name are clearly shown on top of each DVD, so it is easy to find the one I want. Problem solved.",1287187200,18,1771,4.376899696048632

5058399,5,B0076QS2OM,"The case is badly designed -the disks slip and slide once its opened. However, all Outer Limits seasons are fantastic and the endings unpredictable!  Love each episodes final ethical message, delivering a warning that the lack of respect for our environment and each other will lead to our ruin.

5058404,3,B0076QS2OM,"I couldn't understand all the complaints about the Canadian packaging and loose DVDs, etc. until I got this season.  The DVDs are packed on 2 sides of a DVD sleeve and each DVD is supposed to fit into these 2 tiny little bottom clasps that are supposed to hold them in place - each side holding 2 - 3 DVDs.  Well, yeah, they don't hold crap.  I got Season 2 and couldn't understand the complaints because it came just like every other TV series packaging.  Now I see.
I still hold to my review of Season 2 and am grateful to have these seasons available, even with horrific packaging.  I don't understand why the U.S. continues to undervalue this show, and others, and forces us to spend our hard earned dollars in other Countries just to get the shows we love and enjoyed on our TV stations.
The show = 5 stars; the packaging = 1 star; the fact it is not available in the U.S. unless purchased through Canada = 0 stars.",1399507200,,920,4.294797687861272
5058405,5,B0076QS2OM,Another enjoyable season with unusual and weird science fiction stories in alternate planes of existence. An imaginative view of what could happen 'elsewhere' in another universe or maybe they're keeping the real facts from us.,1394928000,,227,5.514285714285714
5058406,5,B0076QS2OM,"Awesome show, shipping was fast! Yes it's the ""Canadian version,"" but honestly it's exactly what I remember watching in syndication on CBS and then years later, the Sci-Fi channel. It's still a killer show, and brings back find memories of late-night viewings! Most of the episodes are good, save for a couple slow ones. Stand-out episodes in season 3 are ""The Camp,"" ""Bits of Love,"" ""New Lease,"" and the excellent remake and my personal season 3 favorite ""Feasibility Study."" Highly recommended!",1381881600,,496,5.135802469135802

8511146,5,B0076QS2OM,Great series. The Canadian release is OK for watching. Too bad Fox-MGM has not released this show with a complete uncensored 20th Anniversary box set as Fox  did with Daniel Boone. MGM (Fox) seems to outsource a lot of their vault stuff!!
