624512,2,6303322417,"We excitedly bought this video for our construction truck-loving 22 month old son. The video starts off great, showing loaders and other earth movers, but then it starts showing waaaay to many workmen and equipment operators and my son immedidiately loses interest. The video digresses away from trucks even further at the end where it spends 5 minutes talking about hot-air balloons and ducks. I just purchased I Love CAT Machines part 3 and hope to get more of what my son my son wants... scenes of construction trucks, rather than a 10 minutes of construction footage stretched into a dopey 27 minute video that loses his attention.",1060732800,4,635,4.888888888888889
624513,5,6303322417,"This sometimes silly video showcases both machines we automatically would assume would be in a children's video (such as road-construction machines) and some others that are quite unusual (a swing drawbridge very much like  one we used to cross every day!)  There's upbeat music as well as  easily-understood descriptions of how the various machines work, often  narrated by people who actually run the machines.  My son (now almost  three) has loved this video for over a year and a half, and it still holds  his attention the whole time.  One of the best of the ""I Love...""  series that began with ""I Love Toy Trains"" (of which ""...Toy  Trains"" and ""...Toy Trains 5"" are also five-stars in our  opinion).",937440000,45,706,4.848739495798319

7843437,5,6303322417,"Our two-year old grandson became hooked on the ""I Love Toy Trains"" series, and he loved these Big Machines, too. The wide variety of machines presented keep his rapt attention, and he's learned several long words and descriptive phrases, and points out these kinds of machines when he sees them in real life. Educational, entertaining and fun.",1438128000,,343,5.035087719298246

7843439,5,6303322417,"""I Love Big Machines Part I & II"" are both favorites of my 3 boys (ages 2, 3 & 6).  Before I purchased them, we must have checked them out at the library at least 50 times.  Every single time I put ""I Love Big Machines"" in the DVD player, my boys will watch every moment until it's over.  I notice that some other reviewers mentioned the silly distractions or things other than big machines being shown. This is true, they do get sidetracked on the video and I personally think some of the things they show are goofy BUT like I mentioned earlier - my kids are the ones watching and they laugh and laugh and laugh at those moments in the video. Actually, that is one of their favorite parts and they usually get up and dance because the video also plays really fun music with those goofy parts. So it comes down to a matter of opinion but think of your kids and not what you would want to watch. This is a great DVD!",1167868800,,915,4.129213483146067
7843440,4,6303322417,"This ought to get a terrible review. It is possibly the most boring video ever, the production 'values' are non-existant with bad picture quality, bad editing (some bits seem to be repeated a few times) and bad narration.

I was babysitting my 2 year old nephew and in a moment of desperation I found this videotape laying under the couch and shoved it in the machine, knowing that he is very interested trucks. He was delighted and couldn't tear his eyes away. He just stared and stared and called 'oh! Cars!' every single time a new vehicle appeared on the screen. I since learned that his parents had not actually tried playing him that tape yet, but that it was now his favorite video.

As I say, it is a boring video, but the monotony is occasionally broken up by some musical interludes which have a light pleasant tone - I didn't find anything creepy about it. My nephew can watch the whole thing three times over very happily.",1154563200,,934,4.520710059171598
7843441,5,6303322417,"Includes some items that are not big machies (a wind-up duck toy, bridges, hot air balloons), annoying diversions from the theme, and an adbsurdly sexist comment. A lot of the footage is repeated, some of it a few times. Overall the production is amateurish, bad sound quality, creepy music, and the narration by a pre-teen is sometimmes unclear. Not recommended.

But my kids love it.",1127001600,,385,4.923076923076923
7843442,1,6303322417,"I was talking with another father recently and he suggested I look into a video for my son that features large construction machines. A quick trip to Toys-R-Us had me purchasing ""I Love Big Machines - Vol. 1"" on VHS. My son wasn't as interested as I would have hoped, but I can attribute it to him being 15 months old and perhaps too young for it. However, as a video professional, I can tell you that the production level of this video is poor. There is a kid on the video that has no business narrating anything beyond a school project. The microphone used couldn't have been anything better than something found on the discount rack at Radio Shack. And the editing was similar to what you might find on your local cable public access station. It may be cute to use your son on your video projects (I have to think it was the producer's son used as a narrator), but not for a professionally marketed tape. For the price paid ..., I expected much more.",1079308800,2,953,4.359550561797753
7843443,5,6303322417,"Great content, songs, and footages of live action construction machines. I found out about this program from the I Love Toy Trains series -- also a great series for kids -- heck, I like them too.",1071619200,5,195,4.444444444444445
