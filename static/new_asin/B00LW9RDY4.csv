8668508,5,B00LW9RDY4,"An excellent documentary on the life of Saint Anthony of Padua/Lisbon, the aim of this presentation is to discover who St. Anthony was and in so doing to speak to every heart for in St. Anthony we will discover a part of ourselves and the struggle to find our true place and blossom in God's grand scheme of things.

Shot on location in Portugal and Italy, the viewer is taken into an in depth analysis of the life and times of Fernando Martin de Bulhoes,(who would later be known as Anthony), his family life, his entry into the Augustinian Monastery and eventual acceptance by the Franciscans where he is given the name by which we all know him. What is remarkable about St. Anthony is the fact that he was always seeking and never stopped seeking until he discovered what it was that he was looking for; the holy will of God. And to do that he had to empty himself of his own will and to trust in Divine Providence, something that we ourselves know is very difficult to do. And in doing the will of the Lord does he find fulfillment, satisfaction and meaning and where his talents are best used and most appreciated. This documentary does an excellent job of relaying this message. The places that were associated with his life in Portugal and Italy makes it a fitting pilgrimage;the attitude of St. Anthony and his dealings with himself, the attitude of St. Francis towards Anthony and a letter which he (Francis) wrote him is very poignant;the medieval methods used in preaching to a crowd, all in all, makes a very fascinating documentary and a visual treat.

My major disappointment is that though the very human side of St. Anthony is explored (and it is fitting as we can easily relate to him), none of the miracles he worked are recounted. In my opinion this is a big negative. After all in his life time he was known to be a Thaumaturgist, which led to his canonization only a year after his death.

There was only one thing that was erroneous, in my estimation, and that was stated by one of the experts, a historian by the name of Dr. Christopher Bellitto.
While explaining the times of St. Anthony he states ""To understand Anthony is to understand the world that Anthony lived in, the world of Portugal, the world where Islam was giving all of this learning to the Christian Church and the Christian church was exploding with this new type of Philosophy and Theology.""
Nothing can be further from the truth:

1) Islam was always considered a heresy by the Church and therefore their philosophy (which is practically non-existent) and theology (beyond erroneous) was already studied and found to be false.

2) The learning that Dr. Bellitto claims that Islam gave to the Christian church was already extant. It was actually Islam that learned from Christian (Latin and Byzantine, which is based primarily on Holy Scripture and Greco-Roman philosophy), Hindu, Zoroastrian cultures and passed it off as their own as all victors did and still do. Even the Arabic numerals which we use today are not Arabic but Hindu. Whatever that was built in Iberia (Spain) under the Caliphates was built on Christian slavery and ingenuity.

3) Dr. Belitto claims that this was a new spiritual reawakening and he attributes it to Islam. It was the gradual decline of the Iberian Islamic caliphates that led to the Christian reawakening/renaissance. Christians were under Sharia law which even Muslims today find oppressive.
Therefore Dr. Bellitto is not stating the real or the whole story. He's just following a party line. I am not claiming that Islam's contribution is nil. But it is not to the extent presented by this scholar.

Other than this aspect, Dr. Belitto deals excellently with the rest of the topics. Also contributing to this documentary are:

She gives us fascinating insights into the life of St. Anthony.

I do not claim to know the contents of these books and hence I cannot vouch for their orthodoxy.

A book that I can recommend and which is very traditional in its content is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Anthony-The-Wonder-Worker-of-Padua/dp/0895550393/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. Anthony: The Wonder-Worker of Padua</a>.

Also the polyphonic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Music-for-St-Anthony-of-Padua/dp/B000002ZXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Music for St Anthony of Padua</a>&nbsp;by the 15th century Franco-Flemish composer Guillaume Dufay is ethereal and goes so far as to prove the widespread devotion and popularity of this Saint.

This is the first documentary of St. Anthony that I'm aware of and it is worth purchasing. If you would like a movie/s on him then the following might be helpful, however they do tend to fall rather short on the factual life of St. Anthony:

For all ye lovers of St. Anthony of Padua/Lisbon, this documentary will not disappoint. Truly he is the Saint for every need and a very dear friend.
