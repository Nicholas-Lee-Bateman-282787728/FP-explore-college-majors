2195103,4,B0006TPE3I,"This is my first video of Hilary Burnett, and I was pleased with it.  This is a solid 30 minute pilates workout that fits in a lot at that time.

I liked the setting, it looks likes a cozy living room but well decorated with pillows and such and lots of candles. Soft guitar music is playing in the background which suits it well.

Hilary instructs one on one and takes you through all the familiar pilates exercises after a brief demonstration of breathing and the pilates ""v"".  The exercises you will see include the hundred, rollup, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, single and double leg stretch, scissors, double leg lower lift, twist, spine stretch, open leg rocker, corkscrew, saw, swan, single and double leg kicks, neckpull, shoulder bridge, spine twist, jackknife, side kick series, teasers, hip circles, swimming and seal.  A brief stretch follows all the exercises.  The name of each exercise pops up on the TV which I liked, there are lots of pilates exercises that I don't even know the name of.  There are also some modifications that are shown on an in set screen which help too.  Most of the exercises are intermediate but some border on advanced, such as the jackknife and neck pull.

Hilary does a good job instructing and performs the moves well, she uses a lot of imagery as well, such as imagining your waist as a corset wrapped in ACE bandages, or imagine you are in a mermaid suit, etc.

I would say this is one of the better pilates videos I have tried it is very complete and not a lot of time is wasted, a good routine in 30 minutes.  Highly recommended.",1136678400,12,1588,4.536842105263158
2195104,5,B0006TPE3I,"I've taken live pilates lessons in class and one-on-one setting.  Due to cost/transportation restraints, I wanted to keep up the progress I was seeing in my abs/core (that no length or amount of sustained crunches ever gave me).  I tried many and learned from many instructors via dvd, but once I got to Hilary's dvd-I realized I found the 'one' who could both instruct and inspire most like a live instruction setting.  Her method is not commercialized, but personalized in its relaxed setting yet still true to the philosophy of Joseph Pilates without being too highbrow for a groggy early morning or weary late evening. In 30 minutes, you will cover a number of the standard Pilates movements without losing focus on quality of movement over quantity. She's very easy to spend time with. At the end of the workout, I'm lightly sweating, stretched out, abs worked and feeling very feminine and strong.. get it.  I hope you make the same and more progress than I have.",1136246400,5,969,4.7844311377245505
2195105,5,B0006TPE3I,"I've had this for a long time, but was finally moved to write a review by what looks to be a mistake on a previous reviewer's  part. A great review was given, and I think that the reviewer certainly meant to give more than two stars. The fact that there's only 2 reviews for the DVD causes that 2 stars to bring the rating down far below what this program deserves. Please read all the many reviews for the VHS version  to see what I mean. It really is a great program for intermediate Pilate practioners. Hilary is a wonderful instructor who cues very well, and I love the way that she makes a fluid transition from one exercise to another. Those who find some of the moves difficult will find the ""picture in picture"" very helpful, showing Hilary doing an easier modification. The soft guitar music, background, candles, Hilary's soothing voice, and the smooth pace all make for a great experience. I'm at the advanced level now, but I still do Hilary's Intermediate from time to time in the evening if I haven't had time to work out during the day. Unlike some of the other fast and dyanamic Pilates programs, this one emphasizes working slowly and smoothly with breathing, precision and  control. Because of the pace, in some instances there may be a few less reps than you'll find in other intermediate programs, but trust me, you'll be working with far better form this way and you'll be better off in the long run.",1133654400,19,1421,4.54296875
2195106,2,B0006TPE3I,"A great DVD, with an intense 30 min workout. I take this DVD on trips, and with my laptop, I can easily keep up my exercise routine while away from home.",1118188800,2,153,3.967741935483871
2195107,5,B0006TPE3I,"For anyone looking to tone up your core while calming your mind,this is a fantastic DVD.  I have a 4 month old and needed to get my belly back in shape, so this has been particularly helpful because it's straight forward and I can fit it in while my daughter is napping -- perfect!",1104364800,3,281,4.203703703703703
2195108,5,B0006TPE3I,I love the pace and difficulty of this workout.  I highly recommend this Pilates series.  It was my first experience with Pilates and I really love it.,1234569600,,151,4.555555555555555

2195110,5,B0006TPE3I,"Hilary's dvd is wonderful, fun, and challenging!  The background is relaxing and beautiful.  Hilary's voice is calm and soothing. This is one tough work out!  Hilary has helped me to become more flexible than I have been since elementary school!  This will really help strengthen your entire core. I have now moved on to her advanced dvd so kudos to Hilary.  I think she is the best if you are looking for strength and flexibility. I get into positions I haven't even thought about in years.  It is also very challenging for an intermediate work out.  This is one of the few dvd's you will look FORWARD to doing.",1217203200,,612,4.559633027522936

For those wanting to build their ""core"", I recommend this DVD. Hilary's instructions are easy to follow. Her metaphors, in particular, really help with correct form. The series of moves spans 30 minutes. Although there are not so many repetitions, if one focuses on correct form, it is a good workout.",1202428800,,493,7.5
2195112,5,B0006TPE3I,"I really like this and other Burnett workouts. They are not easy, but don't wear you out either. I bought all three of her workouts and you can make them as easy or as hard as you want. I love them! I prefer these videos over the windsor pilates tapes. I really like that it is just me and Hilary working out together, I enjoy the personal attention and has great cueing. I recommend this and all Hilary's videos.",1180483200,,413,4.2405063291139244
2195113,4,B0006TPE3I,"There aren't too many intermediate pilates DVDs out there, so I was excited to get my hands on this one. At first this video seemed to be at intro level difficulty, but the pace and complexity of the exercises pick up after the first several minutes. I rate the exercises in this video a 5, but Hilary's commentary only a 3. Her commentary is overdone and I find her long-drawn out voice to be exasperating. Lately I've been working out to this video with the mute button on, and my workouts have been great ever since.",1177459200,3,519,4.416666666666667
2195114,5,B0006TPE3I,"I am a big fan of this DVD and workout. After you have learned the basics of pilates, it is a great transition into harder positions. I do this workout twice a week, and have been doing so for about three months. I have purchased the advanced DVD, but still do not feel I have mastered the intermediate or have the control to move onto the advanced. My favorite thing about Hilary Burnett's style is that she speaks calmly, clearly, and explains the positions very well. Her soft-spoken nature allows you to focus on the exercise and your breathing. She might move a little fast for people who are just beginning, but keep doing it and you won't have to even look at the TV. I also like that she doesn't say insincere or annoying comments like, "" I bet you never worked so hard in your life,"" or ""you are doing great."" Part of pilates is relaxing the mind and focusing, and Hilary gives the viewer the time and space to do this.",1168387200,4,928,4.339080459770115
2195115,5,B0006TPE3I,"Hilary Burnett's Mind Body Mat combines a very good intermediate level Pilates mat practice with exceptional form pointers.  At the start of the workout, Hilary spends about 4 minutes focused on Pilates breathing, first in a seated position and then lying.  This was a great refresher for me (although I'd probably skip this segment next time); I particularly liked how she mentioned that your tailbone should be on the floor with your waist slightly up.  She then moves into the matwork, beginning with the hundred, the traditional first Pilates exercise.  Hilary teaches with a combination of live and voiceover instruction, flowing smoothly from one exercise to the next and following the common sequencing order.  At times, she does a higher number of repetitions than usually found on other Pilates videos, which I liked.

Exercises included in this workout are as follows:  hundred, roll-up, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, stomach series (single leg stretch, double leg stretch, scissors, double straight leg stretch, twist), spine stretch, open leg rocker, corkscrew, saw, swan, single leg kick, double leg kick, neck pull, shoulder bridge, spine twist, jack knife, side kicks (front, up and down), teasers, hip circles, swimming, and seal.  The name of each exercise appears on the screen, and modifications are sometimes shown via an inset on the screen.  Overall, I'd probably rate the level of the workout as low intermediate; I would have liked to have seen a few additional challenging moves such as the rollover.  At the end of the matwork, Hilary spends about 2 more minutes on some simple seated stretches, including a neck stretch plus side and front stretches.  Therefore, the actual workout is about 24 minutes long, or 28 minutes total with the opening breathing sequence.

This is an excellent intermediate Pilates practice that would be perfect for Pilates beginners who are looking to move to the next level.",1144713600,31,1941,5.166134185303514
2195116,5,B0006TPE3I,"I have been using this Pilates DVD regularly since I purchased it and I can't say enough good things about it! I have a growing collection of Pilates DVD's (Stott, Caban, Karen Garcia, Dozios, Winsor, Kries) and this definitely ranks among the best of them.

 This particular Intermediate DVD has the entire Intermediate Pilates series as outlined in the Alycea Ungaro Book ""Pilates, Body In Motion"" and also includes some exercises from the advanced series as well (I did it this morning with the Ungaro book next to me for reference).

 What I love so much about this program is that she moves smoothly through the sequence, but keeps it at a pace that is slow enough to really concentrate on engaging your core and keeping proper form.

 Hilary Burnett is an excellent instructor who demonstrates the poses beautifully. She gives excellent verbal images to work with while you practice and has a soothing voice which enhances the overall practice. The DVD was filmed in a setting which also contributes to the atmosphere of calm which permeated the practice. Still, within this calm I found this to be a challenging enough practice that worked my body thoroughly without making me feel depleted at the end, rather I felt very much alive and energized!

 It's about 30 minutes (almost to the second) so it's very easy to fit in to most anyone's schedule. She shows modification on an inset screen so you have options if you can't do the full expression of a particular exercise. Also, the exercises are chaptered individually and then continue on to the following exercises which is a nice extra tool to have available.

 You can use this Pilates practice as an exercise program on it's own or in combination with other types of exercise. I like to use Pilates as a prelude to doing my Yoga practice, I love the way it warms up my body from the core outward. No matter which way you may choose to use it, I don't think you could go wrong with this DVD, to me it's really outstanding in every respect!

I can see that this program will become the staple of my daily Pilates practice with other programs rotated in here and there for variety.

 Highly recommended!",1139788800,7,2164,4.678100263852243
2195117,5,B0006TPE3I,"I was glad to see these dvd's of Hilary Burnett's being re- realeased at a cheaper price since there were so many good reviews ,so I bought the intermediate right away. I really like her style - very calm and not annoying and too chirpy like other instructors, though some people may find it annoying too. I also really like that the set is kind of yoga shanti style with candles and rugs , not very typical for pilates workouts , also there is a calming instrumental music in the background, quiet and not distracting.

The workout is completely classical pilates with just a few repetitions for every exercise (5-10) , starts with some breathing warm up and the 100's through roll ups , leg circles , teasers etc. The workout ends with some great yoga stretches something more pilates workouts should have.",1138406400,4,808,4.65034965034965

8043150,5,B0006TPE3I,Pretty good introductory sequence. Mostly an abdominal workout with not a ton of stretching but there is a little. I don't know much about Pilates but I think this video covers the basics of mat work efficiently.,1454025600,,212,4.756756756756757

8043153,5,B0006TPE3I,"I borrowed this from the library, but will buy my own copy.  I like to be able to review the video before purchasing.

What I liked:
1. Straight forward, not a lot of instructions.  Good prompting and form reminders.
2. Each exercise is chaptered.  Yes!  This means while I'm getting stronger, I can skip exercises I'm not able to do yet or skip the extra reps while I work up to the level.  I got into pilates for rehab.  I don't have to mess with ff and trying to stop at the right spot.  Great feature!  I will also be able to shorten the practice on days I don't get a lot time.
3. Modifications are shown for ideas on what to do to really focus you core even if your core isn't all that strong yet.
The exercise names come up for each one.
4. The quote from Acts.
Other:
The heavy panting at times were annoying, but I can tolerate that.",1363305600,,842,4.116564417177914
8043154,1,B0006TPE3I,"Much too slow and too short. I'm not yet at the intermediate level of pilates and I still found this too easy. While it was hard for me to do some of the positions, at the end I wasn't even tired nor did my body feel like it had been worked out. I found the simpler 10 Minute Workout more satisfying even though it was at a lower level. Very disappointing.",1312675200,,356,4.028169014084507
8043155,5,B0006TPE3I,"I had done Pilates before in a poorly instructed class, but until I encountered Hilary Burnett, I hadn't truly enjoyed it.  Now I love doing Pilates!  I especially like Hilary's emphasis on breathing.  Breathing is very important to Pilates, it's also what makes Pilates feel so relaxing.  I do Pilates three times a week, usually after running or lifting weights.  If you want to get in shape, I would do other stuff in addition to Pilates.  But Pilates is a great way to cool down after a work out.  It also is great for your core/abs.  No amount of sit ups can get you the ab strength that Pilates can.  It exercises muscles sit ups and crunches don't.  For those who are relatively new to Pilates, this DVD will be good.  She describes the basic forms in detail.  If you are already in pretty good shape, I would suggest skipping the Beginner's DVD and going straight to the Intermediate.  My only complaint is that she doesn't do many repetitions of each exercise.  But if you want to do more reps, just pause the DVD.  WARNING:  I would not suggest some of these moves for people with back problems/ people who are over 40.  You need quite a bit of flexibility and even as a fairly in shape 20 year old, some of the moves put strain on my back.  Of course, you can figure out pretty quickly which exercises I mean and whichever ones don't feel comfortable, just skip!  (You don't want to hurt your back...just trust me).",1289433600,,1426,4.457364341085271
8043156,5,B0006TPE3I,"I purchased this DVD based off of the recommendations made by other Amazon users.  The DVD includes 26 intermediate pilates moves (along with opening breathing and few basic ending stretches) that the instructor goes through with you.  IMO, this was a good buy for the money.

Pros:

I like the low key music and atmosphere of the DVD.  Burnett encourages practitioners to be mindful of their lower back/core while practicing each movement.  I've been practicing vinyasa yoga for several years now, and I enjoyed Burnett's emphasis on using one's breathing to initiate movement both in each pose as well as during transitions between poses.  The overall sequence of this routine made sense as Burnett has you start with the 100 and rolls ups in oder to warm up enough.

Cons:

Burnett doesn't explain the poses in depth, so unless you are already familiar with the moves (or have practiced yoga), I wouldn't recommend this DVD.  It is an intermediate routine, mainly because one is expected to already have an understanding of the basic moves and alignment required to execute this sequence safely.  I also didn't like how short the routine is (Burnett only has you do a few reps per move), but I understand that once one has a grasp of this sequence, an increase in reps could be easily  included in order to really challenge oneself.",1286323200,,1335,4.832599118942731
8043157,4,B0006TPE3I,"I enjoy this Hilary Burnett workout, along with the advanced pilates workout.  The intermediate workout is about 30 minutes, and includes some key pilates exercises.  She explains the moves in better detail than in the advanced workout.
I do wish it was a little longer, but overall, I am satisfied with with this DVD and find it effective when alternated with (and used to work up to) the advanced routine.",1265328000,,407,4.8
8043158,3,B0006TPE3I,"What I did NOT like is the fact that the instructor is not doing enough repetitions; (despite the fact that the whole program is slow)
