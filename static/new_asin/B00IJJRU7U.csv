Thank you Putin for following Jesus.",1411862400,3,282,5.431818181818182

8642603,5,B00IJJRU7U,"I watched this because I wanted to learn more about the recent law passed in Russia in regards to ""Gay Propaganda"". While thankfully short on blood, there were several scenes of gay people being beaten by crowds. You can almost literally feel the presence of hate coming through the television. The documentary is very well done, with interviews of LGBT activists as well as some on the other side of the issue. I am glad I saw it once, but I don't know if I could see it again. It's not so much the violence, disgusting though it is - it is more the pervading feeling that, at least for the short term, things are going to get much, much worse for LGBT people before they improve. The other side is promising to introduce legislation to rescind adoptions by LGBT parents, assuming then the children will be put back into orphanages? The narration doesn't speculate, but to have children literally torn from parent's arms-SICKENING. Some of the people who were beaten have decided to leave Russia, while for some the thought of leaving their families behind is too much. My heart just broke for these people, who want only what you and I all want-freedom to live and love openly, without fear. For now at least, that looks like a dream that is many, many years off. The film left me feeling heavy with sorrow for what is happening.",1402963200,3,1331,4.573221757322176
8642604,4,B00IJJRU7U,Want to learn about brave GLBT folk in their struggle against oppression in a nation steeped in ignorance about modern understandings of sexualities ? This DVD is informative and enlightens ones perspective on the struggle for justice here in the states just by what is said by those individuals who took part. Some of like ignorance and religious positions and influences are not unlike some reflected in the States who are fighting same sex marriage. That this documentary was made by a porn producer suggests that  he should consider changing his profession to this new venue and benefit the general welfare.,1400284800,4,611,5.0495049504950495
