6509405,5,B00LXDQ75A,"Suburbia must be the safest place in the world, right?  Don't be so sure.  In the innocuous world of granite countertops and organized play dates, a little hanky panky can get you killed.  Filmmaker Chris Leto unleashes ""The Housewife Slasher"", a smart and well written film that centers around the mysterious murders of bored, neglected, unfaithful (and hot!) housewives in a well to do Florida neighborhood.  This independent film will surprise you on many levels.

Despite a budget of just a few thousand dollars, this is a slick film.  Production values are polished, and the constraints of filming in actual houses in actual neighborhoods instead of sets lends even more to creating the environment of a sugar coated topping that hides something sinister.  Suburbia has been used as a conduit before in films to host what  happens when the illusion of a pre-ordered perfect life falls away and everyone is left to deal with all the things they never talked about in the first place.  Here, it works especially well because the characters are realistic, and I could have easily met any of these people before in real life when I'm introduced to the friend of friend.

I also could not classify ""The Housewife Slasher"" as a slasher film.  It has all the elements of a slasher film that I love, the unknown killer, the morality issue of being unfaithful getting you killed, and some very good practical gore effects.  It is, for all its parts though a murder mystery that keeps the viewer guessing until almost the very end.  It allows you to question for most of the film, if the killer is just crazy, or normal and borrowed your serving dish or string trimmer last week.  I wish I could say more, but spoiling this film just wouldn't be right.  I tip the hat to the filmmakers for caring about a good story, and playing off of one of my favorite themes:  That normal life of yours will kill you in the end.  Long live horror and enjoy!",1370563200,3,1939,4.655882352941177

Review: 2.5 stars. The 5 and 1 star reviews are off the mark.  This movie has some redeeming qualities but is very much a low budget, suspend disbelief (and beat it with a stick) type of film.

Synopsis:  In a middle to lower upperclass neighborhood, there is a killer.  The first victim is a popular babysitter, the next are housewives and others.  The ""hook"" for the murders is rampant infidelity...

Spoilers / Comments

The various and repeated snafus of real (as opposed to Hollywood) crime scene investigation are worth mentioning...but could not be addressed in this space.  I almost want to call this ""Housewives of Jersey Shore"" due to the Italian - American cliches of the ""neighbors"". In brief, this is a slasher / whodunnit where the ""trigger"" of the killer is infidelity -- which is pandemic in this particular neighborhood.  The set up of the ""patsy"" with the contrived ""I had to shoot him"" is painful but par for the course for the film.

In spite of all of this, the film did hold some interest (or morbid interest about the next plot point) to keep me watching.  The doughy cop sidekick actually shines a bit as the voice of reason and quick reflexes at the end.  The  unshaven yet attractive (cliche) afro-amercan detective (cliche) also does a decent job with the material and yet in true slasher movie fashion loses about 100 points of IQ near the end of the movie...

Overall, 2.5 stars for the bits that shine through and the potential that existed.  Worth a watch if you have nothing better do do or can crack a few cold ones before and during the film and have a truly mediocre experience.",1423440000,,1706,4.671140939597316

6509453,3,B00LXDQ75A,The housewife slasher is your basic Whodunit? The acting ranges from bad(female cast) to really bad(male cast) while there is a couple of nice nude scenes and one decent death scene the movie drags alot and the plot is kinda boring too. I don't regret buying it but i also can't recommend it either. Also the dvd cover is very misleading. 5/10 Thanx for reading.,1416787200,14,362,4.584615384615384

6509455,1,B00LXDQ75A,"I understand they shot this on a limited budget, however, like most other limited budget movies there is a profound aroma of incompetence. The brief nudity was effective, and the blood looked authentic which worked for the killing scenes. Overall, more tits and panties would of worked and made it more interesting.

The other reviews were all 5 stars.  I love a good mystery.  This is not a good anything.  I kept waiting for it to become interesting.  If just killing of people, for at first, for no apparent reason could be interesting. It starts with the babysitter.  You never do find out what the babysitter did.  Too many boys liked her seemed to be the answer. The acting was just awful.  One guy screamed all his lines and spoke the words in second time.  You just knew who the next victim would be. STOP - SPOILER - The story appears to be a crazy husband who went around the neighborhood killing all the women in town he believed were having affairs.  He doesn't stop there.  He starts killing the husbands too.  Many of his victims were his neighbors and friends.  Wives were being killed off and no one, absolutely no one shed a tear.  A husband is told his wife is dead and he never blinks an eye.  He is shown pictures of the murder scene and it could have been pictures of the local park.  Absolutely no reaction.  Just, ""Well I didn't do this"".  Someone please oil all those squeaky doors.  It was the only thing that kept my interest.  Just waiting to see if the next home also had a squeaky door.  Just don't know what to tell you.  Absolutely the worst film I have watched this year.",1374451200,4,1470,4.842741935483871
