7667215,4,B01BT1VPZW,Great story about an International icon.,1458000000,,40,5.833333333333333
7667216,1,B01BT1VPZW,"How about a movie about Tiffany not about their shallow customers.
This movie is not about the company and where it came from....it is a marketing piece ONLY>",1457740800,,158,4.678571428571429
7667217,5,B01BT1VPZW,Very informative.. We truly enjoyed it,1457481600,,38,5.5
7667218,5,B01BT1VPZW,I loved this documentary. Very fascinating. I never knew anything about Tiffany's other than it is a famous jewelry store but this documentary takes you into the heart of what made Tiffanys....Tiffanys!,1456876800,2,202,5.34375
7667219,5,B01BT1VPZW,What  great insight to an iconic brand. Learned so much.  Impressive !,1456617600,,70,4.75
7667220,5,B01BT1VPZW,"My girlfriend wanted me to order this for her so I did.........she loves Tiffany. I love their prices........(not....borat voice). She loves it though and I love her so keep on keepin on, Tiffany.",1456531200,,196,4.96969696969697
7667221,5,B01BT1VPZW,Great movie! It is amazing how much care is put into every piece. ,1456531200,,66,4.076923076923077
7667222,1,B01BT1VPZW,"Must see if you're into a collection of interviews with snobby ritzy woman who love Tiffanys'. The movie was very superficial. If you've come to know Tiffany's as a classic brand and from their family/romanced focused commercials, you'll be very disappointed. The whole romantic family/soft/every girl deserves a piece of Tiffany feel wasn't there in the movie. What was there however was a very superficial view that made me ashamed to wear my Tiffany's. I don't want to be associated with snobbery, wastefulness and with entitlement.

Not much background info on the company either, and not much depth, the movie was very shallow in general. We saw it in the theater and truly wished we hadn't. At some point they interview 2 young girls, maybe 10 years old and ask the question 'What would you do if you received a style Tiffany's engagement ring you don't like?' and one of the answers with 'You'll go return it ya know'.  Says it all.",1456012800,6,939,4.790123456790123
7667223,4,B01BT1VPZW,"Light documentary/'E' Entertainment moment.  Watch the trailer, if it appeals to you then you'll enjoy the film.  One note to all...""Never refer to the store as Tiffany's, it's Tiffany.""",1455926400,2,186,5.379310344827586
7667224,2,B01BT1VPZW,I love Tiffany & Company. Learning the history and  seeing the hand craftsmanship was good. The rest...eh. Entitlement.,1475452800,,119,5.611111111111111
7667225,4,B01BT1VPZW,"Edgy, not at all what I thought it would be... enjoyed the behind commentary",1474502400,,76,4.5
7667226,5,B01BT1VPZW,"I really enjoyed this documentary.  Tiffany's is a unique American phenomena that goes beyond the selling of fine jewelry and bobbles.  The documentary truly shows Tiffany's as a black box (correction...robin's-egg blue box) we place meaning into and the output is a collective mystique within our imaginations elevating a jewelry store to such heights we are willing to pay a king's ransom to own a small piece of it.  The documentary is a fun, entertaining and interesting respite from an otherwise gloomy reality we live in.",1474156800,,527,5.104651162790698
7667227,3,B01BT1VPZW,"I did learn some interesting things about the early history of Tiffany and the work ethics of the staff, but overall it became a yawn with insertion of two little girls being raised to revere Tiffany and disjointed commentary inserts.  Wish they had stayed with the track of the history of founding, the standards established and brought it into the modern day world-wide name and how/why the current generation goes there.  Very overpriced for the substance it offered.",1473465600,,470,5.012820512820513
7667228,4,B01BT1VPZW,Loved the history... some of the celebrity commentary left me yawning...,1472860800,,72,5.636363636363637
7667229,5,B01BT1VPZW,Excellent documentary - stylistic but truthful. May not help promote the Tiffany brand as it makes the brand feel more like a NYC trend than a classic brand. But the film is done with style and is an enjoyable watch.,1469923200,,216,4.425
7667230,4,B01BT1VPZW,"simply fun.  i think its great that an iconic heritage brand can show its fun side.  Many people don't realize that it was founded with a sincere but irreverent flair, willing to flaunt convention and simply make the customer beautiful. Hurrah for American luxury ..",1469664000,,266,4.888888888888889
7667231,4,B01BT1VPZW,Enjoyable documentary for anyone who loves Hollywood glamour and jewelry! The discussion about color and brading was an unexpected bonus.,1468627200,,137,5.9
7667232,5,B01BT1VPZW,"If you love Tiffany & Co. you have to watch this documentary! Even after writing multiple term papers in college about Tiffany's, I learned something new! I thoroughly enjoyed watching it with my daughter, appropriately named, Tiffany. :)",1465862400,,238,5.2894736842105265
7667233,2,B01BT1VPZW,"I was really excited about this movie and thought it would be similar to The September Issue or The First Monday in May.  Unfortunately, it was not.  The movie did not flow smoothly from topic to topic, and where the viewer wanted more detail, there was none.  What really infuriated me were the interviews of the two socialite little girls.  Their comments were pointless and showed their frivolity.  Comments such as marry rich men, get a divorce and move on to the next husband.  Why were their opinions put into the movie regarding Tiffany's, I have no clue.  Overall, the movie needs to be redone.  There were so many areas they could have gone and done really well, and they just didn't.  Disappointing.",1464480000,7,709,4.699186991869919
7667244,4,B01BT1VPZW,I really enjoyed watching this evolution of Tiffany's as a jeweler and brand. It taught me a little about branding and marketing.,1461715200,,129,4.909090909090909
7667245,1,B01BT1VPZW,"Yikes.  This film made me like Tiffany LESS.  It's not a documentary, it's an ad, and as such it fails spectacularly.  Crass.  Makes you feel duped by the marketing monster that is ""Tiffany"" and eliminates the mystique.  Whomever at Tiffany thought it was a good idea to have two children speaking about prostitution and crass materialism really missed the mark, BTW.  ""The more he spends the more he loves you?""  Audrey Hepburn is spinning in her grave.",1461715200,3,454,4.818181818181818
7667246,5,B01BT1VPZW,my wife liked it,1461628800,,16,3.25
7667247,1,B01BT1VPZW,Directionless and baffling.  How many F-words need to be in a documentary about jewelry?  What a turn off.  Stopped the movie and deleted it after 10 minutes.,1461456000,3,158,4.777777777777778
7667248,5,B01BT1VPZW,"You'll love it if you love Tiffanys.  If not you'll probably be pissed off about how expensive the jewelry is and how ""snobby""  the people are. Don't love Tiffanys?  Don't watch it.  If you do then watch away my friends!",1461196800,2,220,4.425
7667249,4,B01BT1VPZW,Extremely informative as to the role Tiffany's has planned in the lives of both individuals and companies.  Recommend without hesitation.,1460851200,,137,5.85
7667250,3,B01BT1VPZW,I expected A LOT more from this documentary. I only watched it because I admire the brand.,1460505600,,90,4.352941176470588
7667251,5,B01BT1VPZW,It's great; allowed me to learn so much about the company and the influence on the culture. I am fond of those types of things.,1459296000,,127,4.12
7667252,1,B01BT1VPZW,Hardly a documentary.,1458345600,,21,6.333333333333333
7667253,1,B01BT1VPZW,"If you're looking for a history of the iconic jeweler this is certainly not it. If you're looking to burn money, time, and brain cells on a ninety minute Tiffany's commercial than this is the film for you.",1458000000,7,205,4.421052631578948
8751330,3,B01BT1VPZW,Okay,1516406400,,4,4.0
8751331,5,B01BT1VPZW,Love Tiffany and loved this movie. Very well done.  Provides history of the company and behind the scenes look,1490486400,,110,4.7894736842105265
8751332,3,B01BT1VPZW,"kinda mediocre, so I bailed after after a few mins",1486944000,,50,4.1
8751333,1,B01BT1VPZW,"I was excited to see this, but it had zero substance.",1483315200,,53,3.909090909090909
8751334,4,B01BT1VPZW,"Fun facts about the store and the movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". Enjoyable.",1481500800,,76,5.416666666666667
8751335,1,B01BT1VPZW,I'm actually not able to give it one star as I've not been able to watch it as I live in Australia I wasn't made aware this wouldn't be in the region I need. Disappointed as I've always been made aware before purchasing. Was very much looking forward to seeing it and bought a second for a friends birthday.,1479600000,,307,4.220338983050848
8751336,5,B01BT1VPZW,This documentary is just the thing for a jewelry lover.,1477526400,,55,4.6

8751338,5,B01BT1VPZW,Loved it!,1476489600,,9,4.0
8751339,5,B01BT1VPZW,"I have always been a huge Tiffany fan and never new the story of how the company got started and the inside scoop on the brand.  It was totally fascinating.  I recently got some new jewelry and was treated like a queen at their store.  So impressive to see a company so dedicated to quality and service.  Also, I loved the insight into the movie, Breakfast At Tiffany's, one of my favorites",1475539200,2,390,4.375
