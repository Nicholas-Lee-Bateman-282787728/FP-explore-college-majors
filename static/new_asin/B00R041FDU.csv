8693599,5,B00R041FDU,Very Cute. It is 26 short stories. Easy to stop because the stories are each 5-10 ( didn't time them) min. long. Nicely done. I love Suzy's Zoo and they did a great job with this. My 20 month old granddaughter loved it.,1432684800,2,219,4.116279069767442

8693601,5,B00R041FDU,"I absolutely LOVE seeing Witzy and ALL his Little Suzy's Zoo character friends finally come to life on screen in this highly anticipated collection of micro-mini episodes. The artwork is adorably classic, the accompanying music score is enjoyably soothing and the mini story-lines are completely endearing. Witzy should be proud of his newly released debut DVD! I sure do hope to see more of these collections become available for purchase soon!
My 8 year old daughter is simply mesmerized by ""Suzy Sketches Witzy,"" an intimate step-by-step tutorial found in the Special Features section included on this DVD. Starting with a blank piece of white paper and finishing with a completed colorful sketch of Witzy, Suzy Spafford offers an up close and personal view into her creation process. From the moment we press ""play,"" my daughter's eyes don't shift off the TV screen as she focuses her complete attention on each detailed stroke of Suzy's hand and she hangs onto every word Suzy shares... simply trying to soak in all that she can possibly learn from this amazingly talented artist.",1427241600,,1085,5.067039106145251
