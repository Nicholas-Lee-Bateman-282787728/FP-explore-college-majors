8409376,4,B003YJ4L3Q,"the 3rd last movie of William Haines is a action - comedy, a really nice one. This is a little bit more serious acting of William Haines than in his previous movies. His co-Star is Cliff Edwards (Ukelele Ike and later the voice of Jiminy Cricket).

DVD: the picture is not restored / remastered but looks pretty good and liked it. Also the sound for a early talking movie is good.

The only minus Star: no english subtitles for foreign speaking or deaf hearing people.",1305504000,7,468,4.4941176470588236
