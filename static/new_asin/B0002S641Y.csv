2117744,4,B0002S641Y,"I received my Vatican Performance DVD of Mass yesterday and watched it last night.  It's a nice performance - I liken it to the PBS version of Les Miz versus a staged theatre version.  The scola and children's chorus are adequate, orchestra ok, celebrant, boy soprano and soloists (for the most part) awesome.  BUT, this is not a staged version - there is some half-hearted attempt at movement, but no dancers - no elaborate vestments - which I found disappointing having seen the PBS version in the 70's and a staged version at Northwestern University in the 90's.  Still, since there are no other versions, this is a worthwhile investment at about $25 on Amazon.  Purists be forewarned, apparently Stephen Schwartz lyric changes (specifically during the Confiteor) have been implemented.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves Mass, but if you are looking for a fully staged version, we'll have to wait and see if it is ever available on DVD, because this isn't it.  The original CDs still offer the best musical quality. The celebrant isn't Mr. Titus, but is excellent in his own right.",1094601600,20,1094,4.818181818181818
2117755,1,B0002S641Y,"This production is staged and acted like a bad community theatre.  my recommendation is to buy a good CD, close your eyes and imagine the production.

2117756,3,B0002S641Y,"I consider the Bernstein Mass to be the most important piece of classical music since Puccini and Strauss were in their prime, and it's much more powerful if you see it rather than just hearing it. The conclusion is especially powerful. However, not having seen it before, I was puzzled by the lack of the broken chalice. I knew what was supposed to happen, and I was wondering why it didn't happen. Thanks to the other reviews, I know what else I missed. If the PBS version is ever released on DVD, I'll buy that one and donate this somewhere.",1296518400,3,544,4.45
2117757,4,B0002S641Y,"This DVD is important to see at least once for anyone who wants to appreciate Leonard Bernstein's ""Mass"", because as far as I've been able to determine it's the only available performance on video. ""Mass"" is a performance piece, and the visual aspect is crucial to understanding the work.

I'm not going to say it's a perfect visual. The production seems dated. It's good, but not great. Still, it's the only game in town, so I'm not going to complain about it a bit. I don't have ready access to live performances, so I'll have to make due with this one.

Musically as well, the performance is good. I'd say the original Bernstein disc is better, but this is a perfectly respectable recording. The weaknesses are those of a lot of live performance recordings. The acoustics of the hall don't seem great, and the microphoning of the singers and the orchestra is kind of clumsy at parts. I felt like I was listening to microphones instead of singers and musicians a few times.

The work itself is a bit dated as well, but (1) in a good way, and (2) all music is dated when you really think about it, whether it's Beethoven, Vivaldi or Pierre Boulez. ""Mass"" premiered in September 1971, about a month before ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" premiered on Broadway. Watching the DVD I thought of the inevitable parallels with JC Superstar, musically (less so) but importantly in terms of themes -- looking for God and meaning with the inimitable, sincere naivete of the early 1970s.

Watching the DVD this time, I also heard predecessor moments in the music to works as diverse as ""Cats"" and Osvaldo Golijov's ""La Pasion Segn San Marcos"". Thematically, I also thought of the old 1960s-1980s television series ""Insight"".

This is a great work (especially the ""Agnus Dei"" and the finale, in my book). It completely deserves the attention it has recently received with the revival by Marin Alsop and the Baltimore Symphony. I look forward to hearing that version, which I have not so far. But regardless of what audio recording we're talking about, listening to ""Mass"" is only half the experience. See it at least once, then go back to your favorite recording with fresh ears.",1279065600,,2161,4.752
2117758,3,B0002S641Y,"I ordered this because our local symphony recently performed it, but the diction of most of the singers was bad and you couldn't understand a lot of it.  The singers on this DVD were wonderful and you could understand pretty much every word.  However, there was a flaw on this DVD, so I will need to return it for a replacement.",1247270400,,328,4.360655737704918
2117759,2,B0002S641Y,"The most dramatic event of the entire work has been CUT from this version.

I can only assume that since this was performed at the Vatican, officials there would not allow what happens in the work's most dramatic moment to take place, leaving the rest of the work confusing and less meaningful.

With no mention of the cut accompanying the disc, this is an incomplete version and should be avoided.",1244764800,3,398,4.671428571428572
2117760,5,B0002S641Y,"I bought the original production of Bernstein's ""Mass"" on LP when issued.  I still have it and the accompanying booklet and all the articles I saved.  How I had wished it had been recorded.  I was wary that this later production would not live up to my expectations, those shaped by an old memory.  I was not disappointed.  The singing, acting, staging, lighting, orchestra excellent.  A fine job of blending large scale and intimate solos, all came off well.  Very pleased.",1241827200,,474,4.777777777777778
2117761,4,B0002S641Y,"I too have been a huge fan of this work since the early 70's, and looked forward to this production understanding that it was going to be considerably smaller, stripped down from the PBS version. But after viewing it, I found myself uncomfortable with the visual presentation - musically it is wonderful, even if some of the vocalists are not ""top notch"". The staging is awkward, it plods and is uninspired, and really doesn't add anything to the production. To make matters worse, the photography and lighting are awful and more appropriate for a live sporting event. The staging is almost non existant and unimaginative.

However, despite these shortcomings, the production does capture the beauty and power of the score and the emotional web it weaves. I'd still recommend it!",1239926400,2,779,4.992307692307692
2117762,4,B0002S641Y,"If I click ""video review"" and this is my first time and I just bought a video could you see how I'd be confused  when it asked me to upload a video from my browser? Ok - you want me to record a video of ME giving a review of a video. Too much work folks. I have production studio - and would be nice if you could do this I guess - and you probably do have some video reviews but - I don't have time for that! Make it easier.

Ok - Written review - Took two tries to get a video that worked from vendor. Quality control on there end or on the sources end broke down. Video is fine now.

Now regarding TAG - YOU tag it. My problem was with the vendor not the video. You know what I bought - you tag it - right? Makes more sense. You've got a photo and record of what I want and you want me to tag what it is I bought -- somebody on your end is over thinking this. If you want a review - fine - make is simple for us - don't make us think or confuse us - particularly for first time reviewers - who - if like me - won't bother after THIS 10 minute experience.

2117763,3,B0002S641Y,"If you want to see stunning night vistas of Italian architecture and hear talented voices performing well, you might want to watch the first 10 minutes of this DVD and then just listen to the rest.  If you want to view an enactment of Leonard Bernstein's Mass, however, this presentation will disappoint you.

 The Celebrant and the leading boy soprano are superb, but they work against daunting limitations.  I don't know if the director decided to reinterpret the story or if the Vatican censored it, but Bernstein's central point vanishes in this production.

 Disillusionment begins with the stage.  About 1/3 the size it needs to be, and 2/3 occupied by an overly large chorus, it is dominated by a sculpture which represents Jesus as neither man nor God (one of the central questions of the congregation).  He looks demonic, from whichever of the 57 angles the camera pans in.  Even more crucial, this Mass lacks an altar.  Unless one has read the original libretto, the critical ""Agnus Dei"" actions make very little sense.  One grasps that the Celebrant experiences a nervous breakdown, but viewers may not understand that the ""things [which] get broken"" are the chalice and the altar.  (Okay, technically, the altar only gets danced upon, but such desecration is a type of breaking.)

 Not only does the Celebrant lack both altar and chalice, he also lacks convincing liturgical robes.  Instead, he dons a cheap-looking garment from the local Robes-R-Us, as do the choir and the children.  The altar boy completes the ""priestly"" garment with a slim yellow strip of cloth, which the Celebrant can only toss to the floor at the story's crisis.  Our protagonist does enter strumming a real guitar, but that is the only prop in this performance, and he loses that early on.

 If the stage and costuming are bad, the stage directions are worse.  The director uses only five:  wander aimlessly, sit frozen, play pat-a-cake, touch someone on the shoulder, or move slowly with expressions of anguish on the face.

 Because of all these limitations, the conflict between the Celebrant and his skeptical congregation does not build in intensity.  Not until the ""Agnus Dei"" does the congregational rebellion manifest, and then, the Celebrant can only wander up and down two small sets of steps, looking more and more unhappy.  To his merit, he does manage to achieve emotional intensity.

 It is sad that someone decided to prune this opera of perceived blasphemy, for in the original story, the wine of the shattered chalice has turned to blood, the miracle of the Mass, despite all doubts and questions, has occurred.  I guess the story will have to wait for a more enlightened director and venue.  Or perhaps PBS will one day put the performance from their old archives on DVD.",1184198400,12,2777,4.911827956989248
2117764,1,B0002S641Y,"For anyone who had a chance to see the original production or televised version of the same, this is absolutely horrific! It was as though this production was thrown together quickly and haphazardly. It had seemingly no direction. What was forgotten in this production is that this glorious, brave, daring work is not merely a genius piece of music but it is also a brilliant piece of ""theatre"" of drama. In this, the performers seemed to have no idea of who their characters were or why they were singing (except for Anika Noni Rose). The director didn't seem to know that this was a piece about faith and doubt and worldliness and choice. It questions who is God, what is the Church, how does it all fit into our daily lives as we struggle here on earth. What it means to believe in ones religion and be a part of the world. In fact there was no direction. What a complete disservice to Mr. Bernstein and to JFK in whose honor it was originally written.",1183593600,7,955,4.462857142857143
2117775,3,B0002S641Y,"I was in the first college orchestra to ever play Bernstein's Mass.  I love the piece and know it intimately.  I was so excited when this came out, because the video of the original performance is being held for some reason.  This video has some good points and some weak points, but to date it is the only full version available on video.  It is amazing to see it performed in front of the House of Cardinals, and amazing to see the response.  On the other hand, many of the sections are sung to recorded music and the performers are mostly young students.  Their energy and enthusiasm are outstanding, but their abilities vary.  Some parts are great, others are weak.  It is not the best performance, but it does let you see the piece in its entirety.  If you are a fan, it is a must buy, but you will love parts and hate parts.",1169942400,2,830,4.303225806451613
2117776,4,B0002S641Y,"Those who may have seen MASS live at the Kennedy Center,

or who remember PBS's 1981 broadcast of that lavish production, will be in for a surprise with this production performed at the Paul VI Hall of Audiences at Vatican City.  The set is minimal, there are no marching bands, no lavish banners, and yet this production of Leonard Bernstein's MASS is still quite a pleasure to watch and listen to.  The singers are more than competent, and what the show lacks in scenery and props, it more than makes up for in ""heart.""  This is a nice MASS.",1168560000,3,543,4.454545454545454

2117778,2,B0002S641Y,"While there are a few good moments in this gooey, drab, mess, I would recommend a good listen to the original 1971 recording instead.

Close your eyes and imagine your own production. The reward will be much greater, especially when the celebrant smashes the sacraments to the floor (you have to imagine this scene as well for the DVD since the director and/or producer did not have the courage to show this action which is the single most thing that makes the entire drama of the ""Mass"" possible; why bother without it?).

Bad production critiques aside, as for the composition itself, I do agree with those that say the text is weak and sometimes ineffectual (especially in the middle, the words ""maudlin"" and ""trite"" come to mind) however, one only has to look at the cantatas of Bach and read the unscriptural insertions of text that are as weak as Bernstein's. The fact that they are in German, they are old, and the music is Bach's seems to redeem them.

I maintain that we are too close to Bernstein's era to judge objectively. I also maintain that Bernstein has done a wonderful thing, despite the flaws, and that this piece will hold up better through time, long after the earnest, albeit piously glib voices of his critics have ceased to sound....",1154131200,,1257,4.678733031674208
2117779,5,B0002S641Y,"Somehow I missed the inaugural presentation of Bernsten's Mass at the opening of the Kennedy Center and had to content myself with the audio only open reel rendition, conducted by the composer.

To see it now in all of its glory as performed at the Vatican (and attended by a slew of prelates thereby laying to rest the iconoclastic criticisms it elicited at first) is a treat not to be missed. All is topnotch here -- production, costumes, decor, singing, setting, orchestral conducting and playing -- doing full justice to the the excellency of the score. This DVD occupies a pride of place in my collection.",1141603200,2,610,4.754716981132075
2117780,4,B0002S641Y,"Fantastic dvd of a life-performance of Bernstein's MASS, performed in 2000 in the Vatican City. Fantastic pictures, great acting and wonderful music.

2117781,1,B0002S641Y,"I am a huge fan of Mass. I have been since 1972 or so. I saw the 1973 BBC/PBS broadcast of the European premiere which was incredible. I saw the 10th anniversary production broadcast live from the Kennedy Center on PBS. It was good, but not as good as the 1973 broadcast. This production doesn't compare. It is a concert production so there is very little staging. The soloists do a fine job with the singing, but for the most part, I have seen more believable acting at my local high school. The classical chorus in the background is small and weak. The climatic scene where the Celebrant hurls down the communion chalice and wafer and removes his vestments and dances on the alter has been emasculated. This is a poor production in most aspects.

Give us the first two video productions on DVD instead of this poorly staged and acted concert production.",1103068800,27,855,4.588235294117647
2117782,4,B0002S641Y,"If one is to compare this performance with the original PBS version, then you will find this production lacking. However, if you take it on it's own merits, then you will be well pleased with this performance. The tension between the Celebrant and his congregation is well done, and an attempt to give each member of the group their own personality, through dress and mannerism, works well. Kudos must be given to Douglas Webster who provides a moving and sympathetic performance as the Celebrant. The Orchestra of St. Cecilia at times sounds hard pressed, but manages to navigate Bernstein's musical tapestry and are most effective in the Meditations, especially in the Mahlerian first one. As noted, this is basically a semi-staged production, and while I will not harp over what is lacking, I must comment on one ommission which I find regretable. At the emotional apex of the piece, when the Celebrant cries ""Pacem!"", he is to throw the Communion Chalice onto the floor, which shatters. In this production, there is no Chalice to be seen, which makes the following song ""Isn't that Odd?"" sound very odd indeed when the Celebrant is describing the spilled wine and shattered glass. This episode reminds me of Wotan singing about his spear, but the director decides that the god will not have one. Come on, cannot a director appreciate the need for a prop once in awhile? Anyone unfamiliar with the MASS, will wonder what the heck the Celebrant is talking about. Now that I aired my pet peeve, I'll conclude by saying that this is a very moving performance that could warm even the coldest of hearts, if only for two hours....recommended with minor reservations..",1100563200,24,1665,4.886925795053004

I was fortunate to experience it at the JFK Center on opening night, the second opening attended by Lenny with the former First Lady and also at the Pope Paul VI auditorium.  It is a masterpiece and timeless.  The Surround Sound does not begin until the Credo. Am I the only one that has this problem or do I have a defective DVD.

The boys choir and main chorus sing out of tune.  The orchestra is not precise, nor nuanced (it is actually a total embarrassment).

The staging is a joke...the direction is a joke....and the camera work is a joke.

For this work to stand up to these and so many more musical failures is a marvel.

The chorus is okay most of the time but there are a few places where one wonders if they will be able to hold it together.  The diction, though usually good, was often muddled.  There is no excuse these days for omitting the inclusion of optional subtitles.  Overall, it is a moving performance, but, since it was at the Vatican, the director had to eviscerate the piece by taking out the controversial action of the destruction of the communion table.  Very little after that moment made much dramatic sense.  I'm not sorry I bought it, but it certainly was not everything Bernstein must have wanted it to be.",1362441600,4,780,4.6838235294117645

There was the breaking of the glass chalice symbol, but not in the Vatican performance. The singer sang of broken glass and ""haven't you ever seen an accident?"" - but there was no broken glass. Instead, he collapses on the altar and mimes a kind of agony. I thought - the Vatican couldn't tolerate either the broken chalice or the dance or the dancing in the aisles, so I saw it as a gutless staging.
