8346450,3,B001VH7AJK,"Mr. Benner offers from the ancient Hebrew culture and language a very different image of what the Ark of the Covenant might have looked like. If you want cultural and language insight over medieval paintings, get this DVD!",1375142400,,222,4.868421052631579
8346451,5,B001VH7AJK,"I have many of Jeff's books.  If you want to dig into the truth of the Scriptures, purchase any of his books.  Looking at the scriptures from a Ancient Hebrew perspective opens your understanding of the scriptures into the fullness of what our Father wanted us to understand about Him and His Kingdom.  One other DVD I would recommend is the one on Aaron's blessing. Both are excellent!",1287360000,3,386,4.647058823529412
