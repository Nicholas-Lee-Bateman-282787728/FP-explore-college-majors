7997876,5,B0000AVHBD,"Where do I begin? I am now a fan of Small Frie for life. The woman is too funny. And she looks good. There's a spirit about her that lets you know she is for real. The others are amusing, but, I feel there is a drop off after Small Frie until you get to T J Mcghee. Mcghee is hilarious with his voices. And the remake of Ten Commandments is classic. FIVE STARS!",1200441600,,361,3.891891891891892

7997878,5,B0000AVHBD,"I laughed so hard at every one of these comedians.  Small Frie was so country it was funny.  Her routine about welfare was too much.  TJ McGee was my guy though.  Imitating DMX praying to God had me in stitches.
This is definitely something I've watched with the entire family and would encourage anyone to feel comfortable with buying this.  It was truly a blessing to get something different but right on time.",1066348800,3,412,4.589041095890411
