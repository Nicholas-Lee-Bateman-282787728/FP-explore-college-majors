8151313,1,B000JJSL94,"My kids love Boz and VeggieTales, but I've been looking for other quality videos. Based on the cover illustrations and product description, I thought this video would be a good choice. I love the concept! I had high hopes for this video. I expected a cute and friendly, accurate retelling of Old Testament stories. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this product.

The animation falls far short of today's standards. There is no consistency of style. (The cover style is only used in two stories on the first disk.) The video features some famous paintings by DaVinci and Michelangelo, but most of the ""animation"" consists of still frames or silhouetted figures that occasionally move against a still background. (The silhouette of a naked Eve is disturbingly accurate.) The stories that are actually animated are comical -- and not in a good way. They make the Scriptures seem ridiculous.

The overall quality is poor. It seems more like I'm watching an old film projector than a DVD thanks to the burned-out speckles that frequent the screen. The dialog is archaic, suggesting use of the King James Version of Scripture, but the stories are void of important details. The story of Moses completely skips most his life, including the first 9 plagues!

The worst part, though, is the biblical inaccuracy. For example, Samson's hair instantly grows back and his gouged-out eyes returned. It also shows Jonah attempting to swim away from Nineveh (rather than taking a boat); it depicts David attacking Goliath repeatedly (rather than striking him dead with one stone).

I can't give it 0 stars; I guess the concept is worth 1. I do not recommend this video. I'm returning mine to the store and begging them to take it back.",1204848000,9,1719,4.917241379310345
