However, I was very disappointed in this video.  I was able to get more information from Youtube, specifically Dr. Shallenberger's videos.",1401753600,,306,4.980392156862745
8585733,4,B00CSALYTQ,"I have become educated about the work of Dr. Shallenberger mostly via his books and you-tube presentations. On this DVD he is speaking to a group of physicians and other health providers at a conference. He covers a great deal of information about ozone therapy and particularly its use with cancer patients.  Although you can find some of this information and much more in the over 20 you-tube episodes by him or about him and his work, I wanted this DVD to share with doctors and people I know who are facing a cancer diagnosis personally or with a family member. As a cancer survivor, I wish that I had known about Dr. Shallenberger as I struggled through the difficulty of getting all the information I needed. And in my case, I could have avoided surgery and gotten a lot healthier overall in my life had I known of him and his clinic. I hope that sharing this DVD can help the doctors and the patients I know who involved in cancer treatment planning. In any case, I really recommend reviewing the info on you-tube.",1390608000,2,1021,4.518918918918919
