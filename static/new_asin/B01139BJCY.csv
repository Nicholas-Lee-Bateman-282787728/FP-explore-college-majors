8723569,5,B01139BJCY,"Very sad story but has a strong message- prepare your children for the worst and make it into a way to give them strength, self-reliance, and personal happiness. The mother in the story works hard to ensure that her child will live on happily and be able to do many things for herself after her death. This is a mother's love that transcends time, space, and cultures. Anyone with a sick parent or an absent parent can relate to it, and feel empowered. Acting is very well done. A story that could have been tragic has turned around into something beautiful.",1518912000,,558,4.534653465346534
