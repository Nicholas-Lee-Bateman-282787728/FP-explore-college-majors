I wanted to take my swing dance to the next level after watching movies like Swing Kids, but didn't know where to start. This gave me a leap start into the world of aerial dance moves.  Though definitely not for beginners, Daniel and Angel break each move down, address safety concerns and make the execution easy.  This series teaches to many moves, and the instruction is so in depth, I can't believe it doesn't cost more than it does.  I go back from time to time to brush up on moves, or how to make them cleaner and present better. Highly suggest all the videos in this series.",1333411200,,815,4.4
