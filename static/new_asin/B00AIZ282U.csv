The film has some great performances especially Bill Crystal, Matt Lucas, James Caan as well as memorable performances by Rebel Wilson  Dolph and perhaps the best performance by Johnny Knoxville in his entire career. But the star is the story, which is bittersweet but really really funny.  May be a classic,  its stays with me unlike most films.",1358640000,17,409,4.8
5439060,5,B00AIZ282U,If you enjoy quirky and eccentric style movies then you'll definitely love this! The entire script plays on those two movie styles and quite well I might add. It's plot stayed understandable throughout and the ending did wrap up the movie perfectly. All of the actors played their characters wonderfully. What more can you ask of a movie...well done!,1523836800,,350,4.9491525423728815
5439061,5,B00AIZ282U,"I love this movie! It's simple, yet complex once you get to see all of the characters. I've watched it many times now and I would definitely recommend it!

5439062,5,B00AIZ282U,"This film blew me away! The cast is great and story was one of a kind...would recommend to any audience except children under the age of 13. It made me cry at the end with its tragedy and positive message. You don't feel sadness and happiness at the same time during a film very often. If you're bored of watching the same old story lines, then watch this movie!!",1522368000,,363,4.27536231884058
5439063,4,B00AIZ282U,"I can't believe I just gave this 4 stars.  Odd movie, times when I was so sick of seeing real life baby-huey in his diaper-underwear I'd think of finding another movie, but then...I just kept watching...and watching...and then realized it was the end.  I love Billy Crystal and Dolph Lundgren, will watching any of their movies.  But still something twistedly interesting about this movie over all.",1522281600,,398,5.0

5439066,5,B00AIZ282U,"I agree with other reviewers who liked this film. Terrific acting, awesome soundtrack, superb direction, a story that I guarantee you have not seen before. This movie is highly entertaining and thought provoking, and includes it's share of black comedy, dark humor, honest human feelings, emotional connections, and some hard edged nastiness too. All in all a five star winner!  Makes you wonder why it's not on more peoples radar.",1520553600,,431,5.1571428571428575

5439085,5,B00AIZ282U,"This movie adds a lighthearted humor and innocence to characters with painful realities and harsh situations. As it is, the movie may not be up there with Silver Lining Playbook, but definitely worth watching.

5439134,5,B00AIZ282U,"This movie really is fantastic.  You have to like dark humor mixed with drama and sadness.  I was constantly laughing at the absurdity.  The viewer is taken on a journey with the main character who is seriously mentally ill and along the way, is introduced to the cast of characters battling their own way through life.  There is so much to contemplate.  There's a really powerful message in this film.  It's gritty, raw, uncomfortable, and really strange.  It's not suitable for children or maybe anyone really but if it's your kind of movie it's a major find!  It's kind of like Napoleon Dynamite on crack.  The acting is just superb.

5439161,1,B00AIZ282U,"this movie lacks any character development, and to not have that for the lead is fatal in continuing or caring for the plot.  Even such a stellar veteran acting cast can not pick this film off the ground, as much as they tried.
I could see potential and perhaps where they were trying to get the overall feel for the movie, but the cinematography was choppy and overused fade in and out, and the music created a ""if movies were played in elevators""vibe.

We gradually come to understand more about the character through flashbacks, and his interactions with an all-star cast, including Billy Crystal, James Caan, Johnny Knoxville, Saffron Burrows, Rebel Wilson, James Marsden, Dolph Lundgren, and Peter Stormare.

The tone throughout is about as depressing as one could imagine for a seedy apartment in Los Angeles populated by a bunch of broke and aimless losers, one of whom has the goal of designing a ""gravity bong.""  There's a repeated gag where someone points out a dead person, followed by someone else asking ""is he all right?"" to which the response is ""he's dead.""  One scene, where a detective describes the sequence of a murder, amounts to a comedy routine in itself.  The image is super-saturated, contributing to the general air of improbability and surrealism.  If you're not put off by inexplicable weirdness (we never learn why the main character refuses to get dressed), senseless violence, exploitative sex, or Switzerland as heaven on earth, the film is ultimately satisfying as the conclusion manages to tie up most of the loose ends left dangling throughout the story.

This movie is one of those little gems you sometimes find when searching for a movie. It's a little weird and quirky but it plays out really well. The odd and raw characters is one of the most interesting parts of this movie. Matt Lucas' character especially as the main character is really weird, especially as he is usually without pants on. I really love how they skim over an ongoing dilemma in the movie, which I don't really want to give away as a spoiler, but it's part of the description of the film anyhow. Basically the movie is about the dead landlord found in Matt Lucas' apartment, but also about the strange neighbors he has in a rundown apartment complex. But the body in his apartment is sort of washed over, which is part of the dark humor in this film. Overall, if you like independent films, and are also a fan of dark comedies with a side of mild drama then you will probably enjoy this film.",1448755200,4,1041,4.343589743589743

The movie turned out to be something entirely different from what the trailer implied, which is often the case; however, I didn't expect a comedy/drama, or is that ""dramedy"" these days, to be so steeped in people's misery. It reminded me of an old ""Hudson and Landry"" line: ""I couldn't live like that.""

In the end, the movie turned out to be a morality story, an allegory, if you will, about the what is valuable in life, and how little time we have to find it and to live it. I suppose if this were introduced early in the story, before the audience had to witness all the misery of the characters, then there wouldn't have been much reason for the movie.

My poor husband (American)  is used to me (British) making him watch what he calls ""weirdo movies"",and I was stunned that he hardly uttered a word during this one.  Then a bit later casually asked me ""so who is that Matt Lucas guy?"" and then, more amazingly, I overheard him recommending it to someone. to put it in his words: ""listen dude, it's a bit f*****g weird, and there's this limey dude in his tighty whiteys, but it really is pretty f*****g cool....""

The filming is nicely done, with overly saturated colors and funny editing. And the music, by Per Gessle from Roxette, fits the movie perfectly.
I've seen the movie three times, and the first I laughed hard at all the weirdness going on in it. The second time I smiled and felt a bit uncomfortable, and the third time I actually cried because it's so sad under the surface.
This is a really good indie flick which actually needs more attention than it has gotten. See it, love it.

5439447,3,B00AIZ282U,"Let's get this out of the way quickly, this is an odd movie that you will hate or enjoy and that's it.  Rent it, and then decide if you want to buy it.  And with that said, if you are a fan of independent film making buy it to support the craft after you rent it.

This is Not Oscar material but it will punch you in the gut at a sensory level. So what does that mean?  You're going to walk away from this feeling something and that today is hard to accomplish in film.  You're going to be emotionally slapped in the face about the love of two brothers, a drunken cop (Billy Crystal) who listens to an old man to save his marriage, Rosie Perez in make up as a nurse in a stellar look, did I mention a murder with a dog eating a toe.

No special effects, just interesting acting, pain, angst, emotion that makes you wonder about the relationships people have.  The scene with the odd ball mother reminded me that we should all value our family and friends more.  The love displayed by a women to her waste of a son, because it was her fault he failed is touching.  The son hits a nerve with his acting.

This movie hurts and feels good on so many levels.  And with that said, the average person is going to hate this film.  But for a select few, it will make you laugh and wonder how in the hell films like this get made; and thank God they do.

A bald guy walks around in jockey underwear dealing with his locked up brother in a mental institution and the people that live in his apartment complex.  In the end it's about humans and love among people.  I think James Caan's lines to Billy Crystal about saving his marriage are killer.  An old man, helping a young man giving him insight into life.  The scene where the lead, Matt screams in his classic neon green pinto to the song, 'he's my brother' if you have a brother is powerful on so many levels.  Here is a character that most of us cannot relate to, his look, his walking around in underwear, he is a total cola drinking, pickle eating freak, yet, most of us can totally understand his pain over the hurt about his brother.

I have to say that it is difficult, for me, not to compare this work to that of Tarantino, if only for the raw emotional concept, quirky behaviors and ""street view"" filming process.  However, the combination of Millis (who wrote both the novel and the screenplay) and Akerlund (the director) bring the dark side of everyday humanity into perfect view without glorifying the gore and violence so many filmmakers succumb to.  The violence is acceptable, even necessary, as are the few sexual scenes that lend credence to the story and personalities that make up this labor of love.  Tarantino's got absolutely nothing on these guys!

The cast is, well... correct!  I can't imagine anyone other than the ""heavyweights"" who breathe life into characters like Franklin Franklin (Matt Lucas), Burt Walnut (Billy Crystal) and Tommy Balls (Johnny Knoxville) but it doesn't stop there.  You've got the talent of James Caan, Amanda Plummer, Juno Temple, Dolph Lundgren and veritable unknown, Scott Sheldon, who makes his few moments as Officer Smith a lasting impression.  The casting list is mighty and recognizable, but these folks were drawn to the characters created by Millis and the vision of Akerlund, rather than a paycheck.

There is a story, one that compels us to realize how little we understand one another in this all too short existence on the planet and lays bare our preconceptions and misconceptions of who we see and how we react and assign personal judgement.  You don't need to be a ""deep thinker"" to get this film and that's the beauty of it.

The old saying that ""money can't buy happiness"" is true and untrue... both are addressed in Small Apartments, however, it brings home the very real point that true happiness lives in our mind, however small or large!

I was both eager and apprehensive about finally watching this film, especially knowing the author, screenplay writer and executive producer (Chris Millis) on a personal level... I'm so glad I gave in to eager!  Bravo!  This is a must see!",1362528000,6,2325,4.877862595419847

But strange and weird, people start dying (that was a little confusing). I love Billy Crystal in any movie he is in and that includes this one. And while i read other reviews before watching this movie, they all were making comments about being confused about the sweden thing.......it was his dream. We all have dreams, that one just happened to be his....lol",1362096000,2,515,4.431578947368421

5439477,2,B00AIZ282U,"Oddball comedy drama about a weird, bald man who lives in a crummy apartment, spends almost the entire movie in his underpants and nothing else, dreams of moving to Switzerland for reasons never explained and, oh yeah, has the body of his dead landlord lying on the floor.  This has a phenomenal cast but as is usually the case with movies that have a large number of excellent actors most of them are underutilized.  Juno Temple has a couple of scenes.  Rebel Wilson has one scene.  Peter Stormore has more screen-time as a dead body than he does alive.  Rosie Perez has one scene.  Amanda Plummer has one scene.  DJ Qualls has one scene.  Dave Koechner has a couple of scenes.  Dolph Lundgren, who is especially game, has a few scenes.  It's kind of a waste to hire all of these talented people and give them barely anything to do.  Of the supporting cast only James Caan as the main character's cranky neighbor, Billy Crystal as a sad-sack fire investigator and Johnny Knoxville as a stoner convenience store clerk who seems unusually smart for a stoner are given enough screen-time to really make any impression.  There's really only one funny sequence in the whole movie--the main character tries to transport his landlord's body and make his death look like a suicide in the most inept way imaginable.  The rest of the movie just struck me being kind of depressing and pointless--although I will admit that I've never seen anything else exactly like it.  But for me that's something to be happy about--one Small Apartments is more than enough for me.",1361491200,4,1556,4.714814814814815
8552345,1,B00AIZ282U,Couldn't finish it. Billy Crystal is totally wasted on this movie but then so is everyone else I suppose. It's like a final project for a film class. Maybe it would be more enjoyable if I was 17 and stoned?,1530748800,,206,4.175

8552348,4,B00AIZ282U,"""Small Apartments"" has a pretty impressive cast - when I saw Matt Lucas starred in this film, I HAD to see it.  (If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing Matt's brilliant comedy, check out the ""Little Brittan"" series).  Lucas successfully portrays a darker type of comedy in this movie -  witnessing his foray into seriously tormented range, is remarkable.

The story uniquely weaves colorful characters (individuals struggling for direction and how to make sense of their lives), into a tapestry colored with grief, hope, angst and resolve.  And comedy.  Some good, old-fashioned DARK comedy.  (Ask the dog - he'll tell you!)

8552351,4,B00AIZ282U,"just browsing through prime movies looking for something to fall asleep to, something light-hearted, nothing loud and nothing I have to analyze.  Saw Billy Crystal's face in the thumbnail along with Rebel Wilson and immediately thought that this should be mind-numbing enough to put me to sleep, I mean it has Rebel Wilson on the cover.  And, even though I did fall asleep right around after Franklin gets beat up - when I woke up the next morning I immediately smoked some GG#4 and started the movie over from the beginning and watched it all the way through.
The casting is as zany as the movie itself!  Rosie Perez, Billy Crystal, Donald J Qualls, Johnny Knoxville, James Caan, and Rebel Wilson?  This cast would be awesome to see really living together like it was a season of VH1's Surreal Life.  Small Apartments is a fun watch and a good one to name drop if you're ever in a conversation about quirky, zany movies that make you feel like a real cinefile.",1525132800,,961,4.5964912280701755
