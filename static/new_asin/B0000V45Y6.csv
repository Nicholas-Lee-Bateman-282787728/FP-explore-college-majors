8003397,4,B0000V45Y6,"Surprisingly good late 50s/early 60s Mexican horror/sci-fi film.  A batch of scientists decide to explore some deep caverns when a young couple run afoul of a mysterious I-don't-know-what.  Some stock footage of ""dinosaurs"" is shown early on and off they go.  During the exploration one of the team members breaks into song. They eventually come across a lost underground city which they do not explore.  Finally the lead monster shows itself, a pretty good quality flying man-bat.  Needless to say a few of the expedition members buy it before the military inexplicably show up and blast the man-bat to kingdom come.  Filmed in some actual caverns south of the border.  The Xenon Pictures DVD release is good quality and worth getting.  In Spanish with no subtitles.  Highly recommended for fans of Mexican horror films.",1379721600,3,821,5.067164179104478
