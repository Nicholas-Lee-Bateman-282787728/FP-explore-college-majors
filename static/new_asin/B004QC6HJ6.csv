4445123,5,B004QC6HJ6,"The 1991 World Series was one of if not the best World Series Ever Played. It featured Great comebacks,Extra inning Heroics and Great Pitching. Can't Wait for this set to come out I own Game 7 Jack Morris's 10 inning Shutout Game on itunes now all 7 Games in one collection pretty Awesome",1302048000,3,288,4.452830188679245
4445124,5,B004QC6HJ6,"When you look at the history of World Series and watch World Series games and years before and after this. You can honestly and seriously say this is one of the greatest of all-time. You have the 1975, 1986, 1997, 2002, and 2001 world series with the 3-time defending champion New York Yankees losing to the veteran and high price packed free agent Diamondbacks beating Mariano Rivera in the 9th inning with the lead and after 9/11.

But when you know the facts about the 1991 World Series that both the Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves BOTH finished the previous year in last place, five of its games being decided by a single run, four games decided in the final at-bat and three games going into extra innings. Plus including Hall of Famers: John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, and Kirby Puckett. The Braves out scored the Twins 29-24 and out hit the Twins 63-56. But both teams were so evenly matched offensively and pitching wise and both teams took advantage of their home-field advantage winning all their home games.

I will buy this 1991 World Series on DVD as soon as it comes out, I've been waiting for MLB to make this one for so long.",1301184000,12,1139,4.5512195121951216
4445125,5,B004QC6HJ6,"At last the 91 series is finally coming out. I remember watching every inning of all seven games as a kid, and I almost can't wait to do so again. This was the best world series ever played and now people can remember why. I'm personally looking forward to watching Black Jack's (Jack Morris) game 7 pitching gem, and Brian Harper's play at the plate in game 4. If you're a baseball fan you'll love watching this series over and over again.",1301011200,8,440,4.378048780487805
4445126,5,B004QC6HJ6,What can I say? This is one of the all time greatest World Series ever played. It ranks right up there with 1975 (Reds/Red Sox) and 2001 (Diamondbacks/Yankees) World Series. Games 3 and 4 in Atlanta were great. Game 6 and 7 in Minnesota are among the all time classic series games. I was impressed with the job A&E and MLB did in presenting these games. Kudos to them for including the pre and post games segments for each game. It went it a long way to preserving the integrity and the spirit of this all time classic World Series. Also-the Twins radio network audio option lends a new perspective to the timeless gem. This is must have for any serious baseball fan.,1299888000,11,667,4.430894308943089
4445137,5,B004QC6HJ6,"I purchased this for my husband.  He has some weird desire to watch old baseball games.  He absolutely loves it!  I, on the other hand, am not so fond of it!  LOL!",1381276800,,163,4.0
4445138,4,B004QC6HJ6,"I'm a diehard Braves fan. I was 13 in Oct. of 91 & it was this team that turn me into a sports junky. It took me years to get over the Braves losing this World Series. And when I say years I'm talking well into the 2000's. If you are a sports fan or a Baseball fan this is the DVD package for you. It had everything and I mean everything. Close games, extra innings, great pitching, great defense, clutch hitting, and a wrestling move(Yes Twins fans that was a wrestling move. It's been over 20 years there is no point denying it any more). There are 4 Hall of Famers(or soon to be) in Kirby Puckett for the Twins, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, & Bobby Cox (Manager) for the Braves. I am proud that the Braves were apart of this World Series (Not happy, I'll never be happy). This was the greatest World Series ever played.",1370908800,3,819,4.189873417721519
4445139,4,B004QC6HJ6,"The '91 Twins were a great team! They could beat you 1-0 or 10-9. The made very few errors on the season. They had a Hall of Famer in Puck and Rookie of the Year in Nobby, an excellent bench and a great bullpen.

This series was not as huge as '87 for either baseball or the community just for this reason. Eighty-seven was so improbable but the '91 Twins were truly a great ball club and played an all-time classic in Game 7. This is a darn good set and brought it all back to me.

However I think they were limited by copyright. MLB could not use stuff where CBS or whoever had the copyright. So no interviews or pre-game or post-game stuff. You start with the first pitch an end with the last out.

Also annoying is Tim McCarver. He must think he is the only person alive who knows anything about baseball and has made it his purpose to enlighten us. His vocal mannerisms are repellent to me, too loud, too abrasive and lectorial. After about Game 3 he finally winds down and shuts up I felt more relaxed. I love Jack Buck, his voice sounds like gravel rolling in a streambed and he's friendly, knowledgeable but not intrusive like that other guy.

So no features plus Tim McCarver equals 4 stars for the set but the Twins get 5 just for being what they were!",1370131200,,1262,4.245833333333334

4445141,5,B004QC6HJ6,it is fine for the money. This was a gift and it fit the bill. What more is there to say.,1355097600,,89,3.2857142857142856
4445142,5,B004QC6HJ6,"I gave this item as a gift ""just for the fun of it"" to my boyfriend.  He was so surprised - absolutely loves baseball and is a loyal Twins fan.  He LOVED this DVD gift of the 1991 World Series.  Worth every penny - if you're a Twins fan, you should have this.",1326758400,,259,3.849056603773585
4445143,5,B004QC6HJ6,"After watching the 1991 World Series it is very easy to say that the Minnesota Twins defeating the Atlanta Braves is quite simply the greatest World Series ever.  Memorable moments for both teams culminate in the unbelievable games 6 and 7.  Kirby Puckett, Jack Morris, heck even Junior Ortiz.  This is baseball at it's best and it doesn't get any better.",1326067200,,355,4.786885245901639
4445144,3,B004QC6HJ6,"While the 1991 World Series certainly holds up as one of, if not still the best, world series 20 years later, the quality control in terms of editing and audio will not merit the same praise.  I was excited to see the bonus feature allowing the Twins radio broadcast audio in place of the CBS TV call.  I have watched some games with the CBS audio and some with the Twins radio audio; most of the CBS audio is fine, though there is already at least one instance of the call being way ahead of the action for at least one half inning (Game 5).  Meanwhile, nearly all of the Twins radio audio is off by several seconds, in some cases two pitches off of the action; sometimes ahead, sometimes behind, but with the available technology there is no reason they should have had much difficulty getting at least most of the audio to line up with the action.  And, perhaps worse, at one point (Game 2) there is a 2007 Twins ticket promotion commercial over the call of the game.  It's nice to listen to the local calls, but better to close your eyes than try to follow the video--almost nothing will line up, making a somewhat annoying viewing experience.  Some games provide more pre-game coverage than others (perhaps owing to the length of some of the games themselves), but that's secondary anyway.  Other times, be it to cut out copyrighted material, save time, or otherwise, there are choppy edits.  Overall, worth having, but on more than one occasion it comes across as a rushed product that, perhaps, no one actually watched all the way through before putting out.",1325894400,7,1565,4.564285714285714
4445145,4,B004QC6HJ6,"Watching this world series twenty years later--still entertaining after all these years. It seems like it just happened--I can't believe it's been twenty years.  Video and audio quality is very good--only blemish is in the middle inning of game 5, the video and audio were not matched up.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars--little to no extras.  In fact, there are no extras, except for an alternative audio track--you can choose between the CBS broadcasters or the Twins broadcasters, which is good if you're a Twins fan, since it was obvious listening to the CBS version that Jack Buck was biased for the National League Braves.  Classic World Series, and worth watching again.",1315094400,3,682,4.904347826086957
4445146,5,B004QC6HJ6,i love the fact that mlb is releasing more past series and greatest games box sets every year.  keep them coming. i will buy every set that comes out.  since there are usually just three a year they are affordable.  i'd love to see some of the classics from the early seventies and even the miracle mets of 69.  how about more tributes like ripken's and the cubs.  a set rickeys greatest or even combined with other hall of famers would be really cool.  bring them on.,1304208000,2,468,4.32183908045977

8438014,5,B004QC6HJ6,"What's not to love about the greatest World Series ever played?  Kirby's home run in game six with Buck's ""We'll see you tomorrow night"" call, Jack Morris' 10 inning shutout in game seven (something I imagine will never happen again), all the extra inning games, all the games decided on the last at bat...  A true classic and one that should be on every baseball fans list of great series.
Pick it up and remember the days of pure baseball.",1449100800,,441,4.5

8438019,5,B004QC6HJ6,"I Never thought that I would find something like this. Every pitch and at-bat of every game. Sure, I know what the outcomes were, but watching how the two best teams in baseball strategized and were in turn inspired and deflated by great plays or little blunders, well it has a timeless sweetness all its own,  I also have the 1987 World Series DVDs. If only all special sports moments were so well documented. I would love to find a collection of all of the US Olympic Men's Hockey games in the Lake Placid ""miracle on Ice"" Olympics, well, I would be a very happy man.",1392940800,,569,4.367924528301887
8438020,5,B004QC6HJ6,My buddy Dave is very happy with this dvd collection. I was happy with timely manner in which I received it.,1391385600,,108,4.190476190476191
8438021,3,B004QC6HJ6,"this odd home-field-advantage that the twins seemed to employ whenever they played in the world series, it detracts from my enjoyment.  the extra noise in that dome, the way braves lose the ball against the white backdrop of the ceiling, it doesn't serve to impress me as a clear-cut win.  i have to assume, from both those series, that the twins couldn't win on the road.  whereas, the way the royals came back in 1985 .. even with the dekkinger call .. and particularly the way the pirates came back in 1979, those series are much more compelling to me.  being up against it, going on the road, makes for some interesting baseball, for me.

so, i like this series, but rank it below those ones I mentioned, and below the 86 Mets-RedSox as well, and some others.  remembering how Hrbeck lifts that baserunner off 1B and gets the call further makes me discount the drama of the Twins' win.

... addendum ... there's just some peculiar things about this series that leave me with a sour taste.  I understand teams sometimes catch some lucky breaks, but to me hrbeck's play, the most brazen cheating i've seen in the 15 or so world series i've re-watched seems indicative of a tip-of-the-iceberg mentality.  in particular, there are documents out there online, if you look, about how the arena staff have admitted to messing with the flow of air in that domed arena.  i don't think baseball belongs under a dome.  an argument can probably be made that the season should be wrapped up in early september as well, to allow northern teams to have outdoor stadiums.  no team should be allowed to put a dome over the field, and thereby use fans, vents, or doors to create wind patterns.",1387929600,,1679,4.597315436241611
8438022,5,B004QC6HJ6,This is an absolute must for any Minnesota Twins Fan.  It is definitely one of the best World Series ever played if not the best.,1386979200,,129,4.16
