6259345,5,B00ID9Q0TK,"There is no movie, whether live action or animated, that compares to this film. It begins in violence and ends in heartbreak. It is dark around the edges then becomes even darker when you get to its core. Stories of alternate/possible histories abound in this day and age; few are done as well as this one. It shows you can do science fiction without space travel or energy weapons.

- The characters develop and grow from start to finish as you watch and learn more about their respective backgrounds.
- The artwork is course and visceral without being distracting. While some of the animation is below par, it's never to the point that it detracts from the story being told.
- The soundtrack is wonderful with the end theme being one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I've listened to.

I recommend this to anyone who's a fan of intrigue, double-crosses, and post World War II scenarios.",1456099200,,896,4.6645569620253164
6259346,5,B00ID9Q0TK,"Jin-Roh has a rich, complex plot set in an alternate history setting that enthusiasts of World War II weapons and uniforms will enjoy.  This has the most realistic depiction of small arms and their operation that I have seen in any anime, except maybe Gunsmith Cats.  This combined with an espionage-counterespionage car-and-mouse plot makes this a worthwhile movie.",1420588800,9,366,5.293103448275862

8641126,5,B00ID9Q0TK,"Big fan of animes like this, without all the childish galore and what not, but that being said it's not what the title or even the cover picture would make you think lol this is about a guy with PTSD and has very little to do with cover picture",1532390400,,244,4.0

8641129,5,B00ID9Q0TK,"Note the hallmarks of master work here.  This gem doesn't try to represent visual reality, it  uses specific evocative visual impressions to  signify and amplify visual reality; the difference between the camera and the eye itself. Couple that with a touching, generally contra and always beautiful musical score,  an outstanding script and an absorbing  and entirely believable alternate history backdrop, and wrap it in an overarching and mesmerizing germanic  meta myth of the wolf among humans and you end up with this. This is master work. I'm sure I'm on safe ground to say the following:  Mamoru Oshii  We salute you sir.",1531440000,,628,5.088235294117647

8641132,5,B00ID9Q0TK,"Very interesting and different from other anime's. It is a bit slow in some Parts.
And gloomy as well. But that is what makes this anime interesting because it Does it in a good way. You have to think when watching this film! It does not spoon feed you the information, you may have to give a second viewing or more to fully understand some of the meanings. And the animation is fantastic.",1471824000,4,389,4.342465753424658
