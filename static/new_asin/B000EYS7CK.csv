8115858,3,B000EYS7CK,"`Close to Jesus' is a 2000 release made for Italian television starring the sultry Maria Grazia Cucinotta in the role of Mary Magdalene. This DVD is available for purchase in -Region 1- format only within the boxed four disc set containing the three companion films; Joseph of Nazareth, Judas and Thomas. The item I'm reviewing is a -Region 0- Korean release presented in English with English and Korean subtitles.

Since the Bible provides little information concerning Mary Magdalene this is obviously a highly fictionalized account of the fallen woman who became a close follower of Jesus of Nazareth. I would venture to guess that a big part of the attraction to viewing such a film would be because so little is known about her that one would be hoping to discover some previously hidden knowledge concerning the life of this enigmatic figure buried within the film. Unfortunately this movie sheds no additional light whatsoever on the authentic life of the mysterious Magdalene presenting a completely exaggerated portrait that not only pushes her to the forefront of Jesus ministry but presents her as an influential figure in the current, ongoing Galilean and Roman political intrigue of the day.

Examples:
1- Mary works in the service of King Herod as Salome's tutor and family healer.
2- She uses her womanly charms on the Roman occupiers, influencing them in matters of state and impending war.
3- Magdalene even acts as a secret correspondent between John the Baptist and Jesus, passing important messages back and forth while John is imprisoned in Herod's dungeon.

There are also other shortcomings in this film beyond the issue of authenticity. Maria Grazia Cucinotta (who is most likely the only one in the movie you might be familiar with) is just about the only major character who shows any ability to breathe life into their role. The actor playing John the Baptist is quite good but he bears such a striking resemblance to the infamous mass murderer Charlie Manson you might find his appearance a little disconcerting. The part of Jesus is played by Danny Quinn (Anthony's son) and he proves to be amiable and competent in the role. However he appears so fleetingly in the film that he really has little impact on-screen. Once you look past these three you'll discover that overall the acting is stiff, the dialogue banal and the storyline unrealistic.

On the positive side the sets, costumes and landscapes are appropriate and well done and the soundtrack is strong, blending well with the on-screen action. I must also give cudos to those involved in these four films for taking a chance and tackling such out of the mainstream subject matter and developing storylines about some of the lesser known but important personalities within the New Testament landscape.

In closing might I say that this film is not something I would use as reference material for a term paper, nor would I show it to a religious education class as part of the curriculum. If however you just happened to be someone who enjoys period pieces presented in a Biblical setting, a devotee to the Magdalene Mythos, or simply happen to be a fan of the alluring Miss Cucinotta this film is right up your alley.

My Rating: -3  Stars-.",1188345600,2,3228,4.911926605504587
