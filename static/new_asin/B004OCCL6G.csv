4437643,3,B004OCCL6G,"It's a shame not every American otaku is familiar with the awesomeness that is Mazinger Z(also known as Tranzor Z). It was one of the very first ""Super Robot"" shows from the 70s, and has spun off more anime and manga than nearly any other titles. This included the Mazinkaiser OVA series which was released in English, and then Mazinkaiser SKL, which was an OVA, a digital manga, and a series of novels. Go Nagai's saga of giant robot gods and devils continues in this 3-episode anime.

Set on Monster Island, the headquarters of Mazinkaiser villain Dr. Hell, three armies have emerged here, and each with their own giant robot militia. All off them have been battling for dominance of the island, and have been sealed off the by rest of the world by a large forcefield called the Gravity Curtain. However, the Curtain is about to go critical, and threatens to destroy the world's gravity belt. So, the government sends in their own special team called the Skull Force to shutdown the reactors at each of the main base of each army. Their two top mecha pilots, Ken and Ryo(not the dudes from Street Fighter!)go their in a modified two-seater version of the Mazinkaiser robot, which was the prototype of the original Mazinger Z. Ken is a master swordsman who thrills in actually leaving the mecha to have face-to-face duels, and Ryo is a gun expert that translates to Mazinkaiser with it literally using gun-fu! Their mission is to the stop the reactor at each army's base before they blow. The armies are the Aira Army which are a tribe of scantily-clad psychic amazons, the savage Kiba Army, and the evil Garan Army. Kiba's forces are defeated in the first episode, and then the Skull Force launches an assault on Garan's fortress. Garan himself looses to Ryo and Ken, but a revived Kiba shows up to fight them as the reactor is about to blow. They stop Kiba by shoving his mecha right into the explosion, which halts the destruction of the island.

Mazinkaiser SKL is a truly action-driven OVA. There's some dynamite giant robot battles, and easily has two of the best hotblooded mecha pilots in anime. It scores some serious fan service which your average Gurren Lagaan disciple will find appealing. My only real complaint was that the English dub has some serious miscasting and lackluster dialogue. Make sure to watch this the next time your planning on having a big Super Robot Wars tournament!",1339372800,,2400,4.739234449760765
4437644,5,B004OCCL6G,"This is yet another take on the Mazinger Z character. The DVD is non stop action, LITERALLY! The show opens and WHAM ,action packed! The Heavy Metal influence and extreme robot on monster violence means little kids should stay away from this one. My only complaint is the movie is a little short but if you like Mazinger and super robots from Japan you will love this one.",1339200000,,372,4.485294117647059
4437645,5,B004OCCL6G,this is one of the best animes i have ever ever ever seen the animation is colorful and leaves no marks of a cheaply done anime the story only serves the purpose to have massive armies of mechs going at it and of course to showcase the mazinger robot in action. About the story it is there but one must pay attention to what is going on or else you can get lost trying to follow the story.,1328486400,3,389,4.0
4437646,3,B004OCCL6G,"I fully enjoyed watching this for the action that was displayed. You definitely won't be watching this for the story; but instead for the amount of mechs that will be fighting on screen. The artwork was great and constantly on the move, and I loved seeing Mazinkaiser in action again; even though this isn't the same one that we have all grown to love. Some of the robots that are in this anime are ones from the older series while there are some new ones; but with so many on the screen, you will realize that there are actually only a few that are used. There is a lot of recycling between the mechs which is only a tad bothersome. I would have rated this 4 stars; but the reason Mazinger is one of my favorite series since the 80's was because the destruction of the mechs was very detailed, to the wiring that was involved and the cracks in the armor. When a robot is destroyed here, it is treated very organic; swords slice through metal like flesh and oil flows like blood. If your a fan of the series, then you will know what I mean. Overall, I would recommend this to any fan of anime, especially if your tired of watching them because of dialogue which bogs down so many of them nowadays.

Side note: If you can find this at a store near you, then I would suggest buying through them. I ordered this through Amazon and when I received it, the DVD was sliding around in the case. When I opened it up, I saw that the DVD had a crack in the center which caused it to become unreadable at a point forcing me to skip 2 minutes. the part that holds the DVD in the case doesn't hold it very tight. Not saying that this will happen to you, just that it happened to me this once. I don't blame Amazon for this and has nothing to do with my review. It pisses me off when people review products on the delivery and not the product itself.",1323907200,2,1836,4.186440677966102
4437647,5,B004OCCL6G,A fresh new spin on a great classic anime action packed with plenty of giant robots  fights can't wait to see more fresh new looks,1322265600,,130,4.2
4437648,5,B004OCCL6G,"This 3 episode OVA is AWESOME, no other words can describe it.  The story of this OVA is very weak and there's barely any character development, but what this OVA lacks in story and character development, it makes up for with probably the Most Awesome Mecha fight scenes that are almost as amazing as the mecha fight scenes in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  The story here is really just an excuse to show these Awesome fight scenes and that alone is enough to overlook the OVA's flaws and consider it to be the most awesome OVA ever.  Now if you want a mecha show that has a deep story with strong character development and where the Mech's have a more significant meaning to the show's story, then this OVA is not for you, but if you want some Hardcore Mech fight scenes, than this OVA is definitely for you.

One thing I should mention about the DVD is that there are NO Special Features, all there is is just trailers for Queen's Blade, Moribito, Kite Liberator, GaoGaiGar and some Computer Game.  Also the DVD is Bilingual meaning its got an English Dub and a Japanese Language track with Optional English Subtitles.  Personally I find the Sub to be Better, the English Dub in my opinion is Passable, so I would recommend sticking with the Sub, unless you really like to watch your Anime Dubbed only.  One last thing, This OVA is a stand-Alone, meaning you don't need to know anything about the previous Mazinkaiser OVA released by ADV films or the Mazinger Z universe to get it, nor do you need to know anything about Go Nagai, The creator of Mazinger Z, however if you are a fan of Go Nagai's work, then you might Notice some references to Go Nagai's other works.",1322179200,12,1668,4.485148514851486
4437669,5,B004OCCL6G,"I got this in the mail a week or two ago, and this DVD rocks my socks off. It's great to see Go Nagai, still keeps up the level. Of action and mecha ultraviolence, and the new skull design. On Mazinkaiser SKL looks badass, keep up the good work Mr. Nagai!",1417046400,,255,4.019607843137255

4437672,5,B004OCCL6G,great still enjoy watching it not to mention it's a great addition to my anime collection i must say i love it.,1395705600,2,111,4.090909090909091
4437673,3,B004OCCL6G,"It was interesting and worth the purchase. The animation is good and it is action packed. I was not a huge fan of the story because there was no real character or plot development. These are the 2 dangerous good guys piloting Mazinkaiser, and they fight the bad guy megalomaniacs in giant robots.....and have to save the world in the process. There's your story. The action makes up for it though, but sometimes right as its getting good the characters start their rambling diatribes and it can kill a great moment in the show. It basically feels like what it is, a tv show on Bluray that never made it past episode 3. The character redesigns are pretty cool, Kaiser's skull Pilder is awesome. I hate hate hate the gun chestplate on Mazinkaiser though and the stupid wired nintendo lightguns he uses to control them. Oh well its different at least and he doesn't pull a giant sword magically out of his chest, so there is that. If you are a super Robot or Go Nagai fan this is a must purchase. Hope they make some new Getter Robo OVAs soon.",1386806400,3,1040,4.450261780104712
4437674,5,B004OCCL6G,"Mazinkaisser SKL looks amazing on blu-ray.  There is a story, its not complicated, that's not why you watch this. The robot design is badass, the animation superb and the music rocks, that is why you watch this.",1369267200,4,211,4.702702702702703
4437675,5,B004OCCL6G,I love having complete collections not only does it save more space on your book case but it also has all the episodes that you can watch again and again. This anime had pretty artwork and i love the plot just wish they made more of this anime.,1360281600,3,244,4.104166666666667
4437676,3,B004OCCL6G,"This new rendition of Mazinger has a new robot with a spectacular design, something more devilish.  A modern upgrade from the old Mazinger and a badass version of the 2006 Mazingkaiser.  The two main characters are well designed but not well developed.

The biggest issue in the weak story.  Aside from the kick-ass fighting scenes, not much is going for the series as the nice animation requires better direction to hold it together.  This Go Nagai OVA is again directed by Jun Kawagoe again.  I have watched all of them (Getter series and 2007 Jeeg).  Unfortunately this one seems to be the weaker series so far.",1358985600,,614,4.735849056603773
4437677,5,B004OCCL6G,excellent!!!i totally enjoyed this from start to finish .the video qaulity was great and i got shiped to my home quick excellent.,1349568000,,129,4.909090909090909
4437678,5,B004OCCL6G,Part of the collection Ive been missing. I grew up on these videos and characters. There is nothing more important than reliving heroic characters you admired growing up! Awesome.,1344729600,,179,5.206896551724138
8437086,3,B004OCCL6G,"Mazinkaiser SKL is a strange beast, merging Nagai's Mazinger franchise with his Violence Jack manga to create its own original story. The end result is maybe more of the latter and less of the former so anyone expecting something close to the previous Mazinkaiser OVAs which are much more in-line with the original Mazinger universe might be disappointed.

Regardless this is a fun show for its brief run-time. It's like a long-form heavy metal music video. There isn't much of a plot and even less dramatic tension but if all you want is a little over an hour of metal-smashing-metal to a rocking soundtrack, SKL delivers. If you want anything more, you might want to look elsewhere.",1494633600,,684,4.846153846153846
