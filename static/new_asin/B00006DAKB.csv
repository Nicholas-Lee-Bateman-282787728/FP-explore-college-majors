1743425,4,B00006DAKB,"I also saw SIGNS and even though I felt it lacked an actual plot, I loved the idea that these crop circles are popping up all over the world-  and some are the most beautiful, intricate designs that make you question if there are really that many hoaxers out there with art degrees wasting their education on wheat & barley, or if unknown extra-terrestrial forces are responsible for these patterns.  I enjoyed this video, but got tired of the repetitive ""alien"" connection theory.  There has never been a logical explanation or proof of the connection between UFO's and crop cirlces, so to categorize this subject as an outerspace connection seems like such a cop-out. The History Channel did a 2-part special recently on crop circles, with interviews of the actors in the movie SIGNS, and they themselves poked fun at this phenomenon by having hoaxers create a large H in a field nearby as they did their ""documentary""-  deliberately showing how, within a few hours a design can be created with a board and a rope.  I would like to think that Mother Nature is the one with the sense of humour and is responsible for these designs-  and she is smiling down at us because instead of just enjoying these visual gifts and accepting them as such, we have to probe & question, and place blame....  Geesh!  Ain't we humans a pain in the ... sometimes?  : )",1031529600,6,1351,4.619246861924686

7967354,5,B00006DAKB,"I have been following unexplained phenomena for over 40 years and it has given me much in the way of entertainment,wonderment,scepticism,curiosity,etc.,and I will probably continue to do so. The world is filled with miracles,and things we will never fully understand,but it is that never ending search for knowledge and understanding that separates man from all other life forms. Even if you subscribe totally to the theory of Evolution or that of Divine Creation;there are still untold things that we don't understand ,can't even imagine,and that will undoubtedly continue as long as mankind continueshis search for answers.
 Whether it's mysteries of structures found around the world as Erich Von Daniken fascinated us with his ""Chariots Of The Gods"",Extra-terrestrials and UFO's,The Lock Ness Monster,Big Foot,Ghosts,The Oak Island Mystery,Jack The Ripper,The JFK Assassination,The Bermuda Triangle,The Shroud of Turin,Predictions of the End of the World,people will always wonder at things they don't understand or cannot find answers to.
 Crop Circles are something that continue to defy explanation and certainly lead to unlimited theories,speculation,hoaxes,personal experiences and testimonials.
 This DVD,though somewhat dated,is really more about a man ,Colin Andrews and his ,whathas now become a lifetime search in determining the true source of these circles. Not unlike UFO's, the whole subject of Crop Circles,is filled with hoaxes,illusions,explanations,some that are true and others that are false,but there are still many for which the source is still unexplained. As I said,this DVD,is more about Colin Andrews and his quest for an explanation;but if you are more interested in detailed photographs and actual locations,there are much better books.
One such book is ""Crop Circles"" by Steven and Karen Alexander,published 2006 and for which I wrote a Review on August 6,2008. Much of what I covered in that review applies to this DVD.
 Wlii we ever know the full explanation of all the mysteries that surround us? I doubt is ;and what a dull world it would be if we did.",1319068800,,2089,5.498442367601246
7967355,5,B00006DAKB,"I watched this video about a month ago and was impressed and intrigued.  I am surprised that it only has a few reviews and none of them are very glowing.  One reviewer even called it ""disappointing"" - wow, I disagree.  I started watching the movie with no expectations and was amazed by some of the information shared.  I've read one of Colin Andrews' books and it was great to see him interviewed.  I really liked the informal format in his home with his friend interviewing him.  This gives a very ""real"" look at his life and his story and his work.  The part about him being set up and about the mainstream media's hoopla was very interesting!  The part about his experience with the CIA person was crazy!  How can anyone say this stuff is less than five stars?  This is one of the main crop circle researchers, telling it like it is in his own home with his friend - come on people!  :)  Anyway, for anyone who's interested in this, check out this video.  I learned of Colin Andrews through Drunvalo Melchizedek's writing and it is indeed must-read/see information for those no longer looking the other way.  This is the real deal, folks!",1230249600,,1142,4.507317073170731
7967356,4,B00006DAKB,"I really enjoy this topic so I really enjoyed this video and learning more about how Colin Andrews and crop circles themselves are set up to look like a hoax. I wish skeptics who don't know, but only believe, would either take a serious look or actually prove them to be a hoax...which so far they have not been able to do. But when someone tries to discredit another person based on a belief, not knowledge, then they just show how low humanity can go.

Peter Robbins, noted UFO researcher and author interviews Colin Andrews, noted crop circle researcher and author about conspiracies and cover-ups and personal mistakes made. Chatty interview, not very informative. The only real value in the DVD is the photo gallery located in the ""extras"" section.",1089331200,5,396,5.387096774193548
7967358,2,B00006DAKB,"I have been seeking an objective documentary about the history of crop circles. This is a buddy video. Peter Robbins is a UFO author/researcher interviewing Colin Andrews on his experiences with crop circles. Lots of talk of cover-ups, conspiracies, mistakes made and the CIA. Not much worthwhile information in the DVD. Disappointing.
In the ""extras"" section there are some interesting photos.
This DVD is worth about $5.00",1089072000,4,424,5.343283582089552
7967359,4,B00006DAKB,"Filmed just prior to the release of the movie ""Signs"", this documentary is essentially an interview with Colin Andrews interspersed with aerial photos and videos of crop circle formations.  The film gives Andrews an opportunity to exonerate himself from the bad press he garnered when he was ""set up"" as a hoax by the mass media, to review his 20 year career as a circle investigator, and to ruminate about the significance of these phenomena.  Included is the rarely seen footage of a crop circle being made in 10 or so seconds while balls of light swirl overhead.
The only serious drawback is the presentation of the circles themselves.  The viewer is presented with galleries of circle  formations that flash by too quickly to actually see much of anything.  You have to slow the DVD speed to a virtual standstill (or better yet, pause) in order to linger over individual images.
Despite the fact that this film is as much about Andrews as it is about the phenomenon, anyone remotely interested in crop circles should view this documentary.",1081728000,3,1043,4.837078651685394
7967360,3,B00006DAKB,"The subtitle here is kind of a turn off because while some want UFO's everywhere, the program itself never really says anything to warrant such a title and in fact doesn't really profess to have any idea who or what in fact creates most of the genuine circles.
Colin Andrews tells us that most (80% of British crop circles within a two year period)are made by human hands but that a significant number are in fact genuine. I was disappointed with the way the real (and small amount of)information was presented in that while we are told some very important details in how to determine the origin of a circle, almost none of this information is actually shown. I wanted some close ups of the various bent down crops and descriptions of what did it, you'll also need to listen closely as the DVD has no subtitling.
The interview is kind of amatuerish, patched together, you'll likely be tempted to skip it although if you do sit through it you'll hear some little bits.
The gallery bits had most of the useful information in the program although they were lacking the closeups I wanted. There's one example of a fascinating formation done in a field near Stonehenge apparently within a 45 minute or less time period, no one saw a thing even though it was in broad daylight next to a highway.
In his interview Andrews says that the CIA tried to get him to pronounce the crop circle phenomenon a hoax, and it seems to me that he indicated that the press and the British Govt. also have had a hand in debunking attempts. In one of the gallery selections is of a fascinating video done of a crop circle formation actually being formed, I believe Mr. Andrews said that his group traced the photographer's origin down and had reason to believe that it wasn't real (or was it that the British Government had the ability to do these things?, I'm not sure which).
I've seen better crop circle programs.",1047513600,6,1891,4.548387096774194
