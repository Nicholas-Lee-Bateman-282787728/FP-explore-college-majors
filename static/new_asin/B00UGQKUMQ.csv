8706771,5,B00UGQKUMQ,"Everyone who insists the USA doesn't need a minimum wage, labor unions or worker safety standards should be required to watch this documentary.  The women who lost their lives in this horrific disaster died because of this erroneous belief, greed and an overall lack of concern for the working class aka the poorest Americans.  This documentary is all the more relevant today than it was a hundred years ago.  The faces of these innocent workers, many of them not of adult age, speak to us from their graves to continue their cause and to speak in their names for generations of workers to come.  A heartrending documentary.",1487808000,,624,4.803738317757009
