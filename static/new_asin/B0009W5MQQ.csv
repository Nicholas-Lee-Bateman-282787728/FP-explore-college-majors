8176648,5,B0009W5MQQ,"This is an anime that aired in the same timeslot Magical Doremi, The Adventures of Nadja Applefield and the Pretty Cure series aired in back in 1997 and ended in 1999. It follows the adventures of a young girl named Princess Silver who has 12 bad habits. Unfortunately, on the day of her 12th birthday, she wants to find a boy to fall in love with and accidentally gets into a fight with one, causing the civillians of the Crayon Kingdom to run away, and causing her mom and dad to turn into stone. She then has many misadventures trying to get them to come back. From visiting a village of skunks to going to school to having troubles with her younger sister, Princess Silver's adventures will leave you wanting more. Also, the episode ""June's Journey (Part 1)"" aired the day I was born! If I could think of an American equivalent for this show (since the dub that supposedly aired in Australia never aired on Fox Kids in America due to the Disney buyout), it would be Britt Allcroft's Magic Adventures of Mumfie-both have very similar storylines, both are based on children's novels, and both aired during the same time period. My only problem is that nobody remembers this anime at all, so if you want to see something different, check this anime out.",1411171200,,1254,4.5777777777777775
