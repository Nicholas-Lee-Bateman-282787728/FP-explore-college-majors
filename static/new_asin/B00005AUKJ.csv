8195375,2,B00005AUKJ,"An alright dbz dvd. The androids finally come. The extras are not anything special, and I care less how they included 2 language versions. Who cares about the original japenese, people really need to just realize english is better. The voices in Japanese are horrible and do not fit the characters at all (because the voices are too high and annoying). But in English they did a really good job with this DVD. Still it is kinda boring, and if you have seen it on TV there is no point in getting it.",1041465600,2,498,4.365591397849462
8195376,4,B00005AUKJ,"This is a great DVD with lots of action.  First Vegeta easily destroys Android 19.  Then Dr. Gero tries to escape, but gets into a small battle with Piccolo and then escapes again.  The menu system is exactly the same as the rest of the Androids Saga.  This is definitely a DVD you don't want to skip.",1019088000,,301,4.228070175438597
8195377,4,B00005AUKJ,"In these three episodes, a newly Super Saiya-jin Vegeta continues his battle against Jinzoningen 19 Gou, and easily destroys him using his new technique, the ""Big Bang Attack."" Yamcha brings Gokuu back to his house for treatment for the heart disease. Jinzoningen 20 Gou discovers that he's made a terrible miscalculation, and begins his retreat into the mountains. Trunks returns from his timeline to discover that the jinzoningen his friends are battling against are completely different from the ones of his own time. It is here that Vegeta and Bulma finally find out that the young boy with purple hair is actually their son, Trunks, from the future. Dr. Gero rushes back to his laboratory in an attempt to awaken Jinzoningen 17 Gou and 18 Gou.. the ones from Trunks' timeline. Everyone rushes off to find the lab before Gero returns, in an attempt to both fight the jinzoningen (Vegeta) or destroy them before their awakening (the rest of the gang).
FUNimation continues to toy with the font used for the title on the front cover, and it continues to look really nice (""better"" is a relative term). This time around, it's in a green color (same font), and now with a shadow effect. This may be due to the very light background, but regardless, it's good looking. The splash concerning the contents is in this same new font. The back cover is the VHS version with a lot of nice touch-ups. Instead of a bland blue background, it's light brown with green splashes behind the two screen caps. The screen caps now have a rounded white border and shadow to them. Very sleek looking.
No insert. Disappointing, but not surprising. C'mon.. can you at least give us a picture of Dr. Gero, or something?
From here on out, all comments will refer to the Japanese version watched / listened to, unless otherwise noted.
I dunno if I was just spoiled by the transfer of ""Mystical Adventure,"" or if I'm just much more aware of the technical stuff on DVDs.. but the TV episode masters have a lot of scratches and artifacts to them. This doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the show (and it's something you'd notice while watching the dub on TV, too), but it's there. I think they've done the best they could to touch up the existing video; there's no chance or logical reasoning behind going back and remastering the video to a 500+ episode series, so I can't exactly hold it against them. It looks fine for a show its age (we're dealing with episodes that aired around 1992, originally, here). Regardless of any of this, it's wonderful to finally see these episodes in Japanese with a nice looking picture.
The audio continues to sound fine, with as little pops as possible. Again, it's a show from 1992, so we've got the original broadcast mono soundtrack. It's booming and clear, so I don't mind at all.
Now for the fun stuff. The nit-picks.
No, the eye-catches aren't back, yet. Not a big deal. They're cute and all, and I would absolutely love it if they were retained, but it really doesn't hurt the over-all show that they're not included. ""Cha-La Head-Cha-La"" and ""Detekoi Tobikiri ZENKAI Power!"" play only once (at the beginning and end, respectively), once more. The recaps are included, again, as well as the English-only preview at the end of the disc. It would really be nice if we could get the songs played with every episode like every other anime DVD.. ah, well..
These extras are getting really boring. I've already got the ""World of DragonBall"" on five other DVDs. Let's put this space towards interviews with the voice actors, or something, guys. Yay, commercials for ""Mystical Adventure"" and Cell stuff.. WHO CARES?! These aren't ""extras"".. they're ""extra boring.""
The menus are not animated, but they keep getting better. Very sleek in design, colorful, and work and load wonderfully. Dub music accompanies each individual menu (different tune each menu). I understand that each saga of discs retain the same menu, but seeing as how Jinzoningen 16-18 aren't even in this disc (or the one before it).. I don't think they belong on the main menu screen. Don't get me wrong, it's really nice.. but doesn't fit this particular disc.
Steve Simmons returns to do the translations, again. It's fun to finally see Yajirobei represented as how he really talks (""Hey! Don't tell me yer fixin' to take us down to that island?"").
The ""uncut"" English dub is included. I really had no interest in watching it, except to hear Eric Johnson. It was about here that he *really* starting falling into role, and soon became (who I consider) the best voice actor FUNimation has. Chris Sabat's Vegeta had drastically improved as well (listen to the ""Ginyu"" Vegeta compared to this one.. massive change). I really hate the dub music.. nothing more to say about it.",985046400,9,4753,4.7764277035236935

8195379,5,B00005AUKJ,THese videos are from the android saga when vegeta is super saiyan. The reason you should buy this(I suggest this item for dragon ball z fans)item is because it's gonna be months before they air on television.,963273600,,209,4.675675675675675
8195380,4,B00005AUKJ,This is about dr. gereo and the androids that he makes.  Remember trunks warns goku and every one that in three years the androids would come. To find out more order the video.,962841600,,176,4.333333333333333

8195382,5,B00005AUKJ,"This video starts the long awaited battle with the 2 androids(#19 & #20) Dr. Gero built. Will the training of  3 years be enough by the all z-warriors to handle these 2 androids?. we can only wait and see when this  video comes out, but we all trust in Goku and their friends to handle them  and of course be victorious.",961804800,,320,4.213114754098361
