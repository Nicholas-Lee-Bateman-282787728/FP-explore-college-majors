8598900,1,B000PTYKBG,This DVD does not work in either of my Blu-Ray players. Sony states that they upgraded my Firmware so it's the fault of the DVD manufacturer. I called and left a message and have been ignored when I ask for help. As far as I am concerned the company is bogus and unrealiable and Amazon should not carry such poor quality illigitamate products as this. Buyer beware this product does not work on most Blu-Ray players and if I did get a bogus DVD there is no customer support to try and fix the issue. Since the item is opened I basically lost my money so I will not recomend nor endorse any of this companies poor excuse for a product!!!!! My Blu-Ray Players are both not listed in the warning so don't trust the warning just skip it!!!! Every other Blu-Ray disk I have purchased from a repudible manufacturer has worked wonderfully so the fault lies with the Living Landscapes product!!!,1188172800,,887,4.481481481481482
8598901,4,B000PTYKBG,"The description, above, says it might not play on your Sony BDP-S1 player. However, if you have upgrade versions 1.6 or 2.0 or higher, it will play fabulously.  It has wonderful photography and is very well done!",1182384000,,212,4.72972972972973
