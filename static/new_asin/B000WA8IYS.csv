3422381,5,B000WA8IYS,Great looking bluray and very happy to now have this movie in my bluray collection 10 out of 10 on this one.,1452643200,,108,3.9545454545454546
3422382,5,B000WA8IYS,"I believe this is the film that got director Losey off the Black List and back to life.  Written by Shaw -- always under rated -- and with fantastic performances by Shaw and McDowell, this is a knockout film that owes little to any genre and everything to the illusive world of ""art"".  Action adventure if written by Picasso.  A must see.

EDIT:  Actually, another director and writer, on another project got Losey off the blacklist and once off, turned away from their project and did this.  Still amazing.",1436572800,10,507,4.640449438202247

8271598,1,B000WA8IYS,"I flew through this dull, meatless, time-wasting, agonizingly Kafkaesque touch of the surreal faster than the film's pursuing helicopter -- thanks to my trusty remote control.

""Figures in a Landscape"" desperately needed (and rightfully deserved) a one-star rating, and I am honored to be the first one (apparently) to be given the esteemed privilege to provide it.",1468713600,,365,5.4035087719298245
8271599,5,B000WA8IYS,"Super great and unusual movie, especially for the time it was made. Great actors great director, really exceptional film. You don't see it? Look again.",1468713600,,151,5.08
8271600,5,B000WA8IYS,"Great movie..... I wish other Robert Shaw hard to find movies would be made
available in a format that could be played in USA.",1467072000,,126,4.291666666666667
8271601,3,B000WA8IYS,"Brilliant start, had me riveted, and then fizzled into nothing. It's Robert Shaw, I had to watch.",1463529600,,97,4.764705882352941
8271602,5,B000WA8IYS,"One of the most obscure movies in the Joseph Losey canon seemed an improbable candidate for Blu-Ray preservation but we have it and, once past the opening credits, the visual quality is fantastic. That is in part a credit to Losey, who obtained remarkably consistent results from four (!) cinematographers. The title is apt, as the movie is in part a series of semi-abstract studies of two men pitted against a vast, unforgiving environment.  Losey's mastery of the movie frame is on full display here, given further scope by the use of Panavision, which enables some complex compositions.

Robert Shaw's screenplay and lead performance bristle with vigor, keeping the action (and Losey's camera) on the move and Malcolm McDowell holds his own against the formidable Shaw ... who does get all the best lines, though. The storyline concerns two fugitives (we're never even given their full names, just ""Ansell"" and ""Mac"") on the run from an unnamed captor in an unidentified -- if Mediterranean-looking -- country, desperately heading toward the border. Their primary antagonist is the dogged helicopter that keeps hunting them down, unnervingly hovering and swooping, taking on the force of a personal antagonist to Mac. The idea of being at the mercy of all-seeing, ever-present technology has only grown in force since ""Figures in a Landscape"" was made, so kudos to Losey, Shaw and novelist Barry England for their prescience. High marks all around -- and thank you, Kino Lorber/CBS.",1461283200,3,1485,5.132231404958677
8271603,5,B000WA8IYS,I waited more than 40 years for this...Well worth it!,1456790400,,53,4.4
8271604,5,B000WA8IYS,Lousy movie but excellent product by the seller.,1456358400,,48,5.125
8271605,4,B000WA8IYS,"The plot is simple and sometimes that makes for the most effective movie storytelling:

Two fugitives on the run (Robert Shaw and Malcolm McDowell) travel through an unforgiving landcape pursued by helicoper whose pilot refuses to give up chasing these two.

Sharing a structure not to dissimiliar to Steven Spielberg's later ""Duel"", ""Figures in a Landscape"" was written or the screen by Shaw (an acclaimed playwright on his own) from a novel by Barry England. The direction by Joseph Losey (""The Go-Between"", ""Mr. Klein"", ""These Are The Damned"", ""The Servant"") adds to the suspense of this unjustly forgotten minor classic.

It isn't the most accessible movie and doesn't live up to the advertising copy on the back about the film belonging to action/adventure genre unless it's the art house version of that genre.

It was a tough sell for a picture like this back in the day and, given the short attention spans and focus on big explosions in movies that dominant today, it might even be a tougher sell. ""Figures In A Landscape"" remains an acquired taste but it is an extremely well made and acted acquired taste.

After losing a director (Peter Medak),  actor (Peter O'Toole) and going through a complete rewrite (Stanley Mann wrote one of the early scripts) the film finally entered production with rewrites (by Shaw) occurring daily as production progressed.

Sadly the release from Kino doesn't have any special features (a commentary might do wonders for those lost souls out there) or even subtitles. This is an example of a film that deserves a commentary track by a knowledgable film expert as the production (one of the first to feature McDowell after ""If..."" But before the release of ""A Clockwork Orange"") is bound to have interesting stories.

The transfer looks quite nice and audio is capably transferred. The listing here implies that this is a multi-disc edition i.e., the Blu-ray includes a DVD but that's not the case.

That's a pity. This is the type of film that will be lost and forgotten about except to those who were caught up in the film.

I'd recommend renting before buying to see if this appeals to you but I enjoyed it.",1454544000,7,2151,4.852459016393443
8271606,3,B000WA8IYS,"Listing is inaccurate - but product is alright...  This is NOT a multi-format set as listed (""Format: Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, NTSC, Original recording remastered, Widescreen""), but rather, a blu-ray with widescreen format.
  The listing says Blu-ray in the title, but you'll note that your buying options are for either ""DVD"" or ""Multiformat"" and the above-quoted line in parentheses is in the product description.  But Multi-format would include a DVD version, or at minimum one would think, the choice of standard or widescreen options for playback (?) -- this includes neither.  It is a single disc, widescreen blu-ray, and your only options in the disc menu are ""play"" and ""chapters"", no extras, no subtitles/languages/etc...  I had expected from the listing, a true multiformat to play on my various dvd & blu-ray players and with subtitles.  **Please also note that there is a very significant hiss in the audio and in the beginning, during the credits in particular, the video is ""dirty"" with some snow and black marks/shadows/streaks.  However, while the snow appears on and off throughout, the black streaks/shadows are only visible in the very beginning while the introductory credits are playing. Of course, they are dependent upon the source video to develop a disc, but buyers should be aware of these quality issues when weighing options.",1452988800,9,1355,5.2407407407407405
