1199601,1,B00000F0IC,"Steely Palance and luscious Lynley are wasted in this shoot 'em up ""spoof"" of gangster flicks.",1058745600,,94,4.9375

7906111,3,B00000F0IC,"It was interesting to see Jack Palance in this 'comic-book' role, but the movie was really stupid.",1457222400,,98,4.823529411764706
7906112,4,B00000F0IC,"It's an fun gangster comedy. Not bad, not good but kind of fun. The ""Over Play"" roles are intentional and although silly at times add a Abbot & Costello feel to the movie. If you are under fifty-five you might find this movie a bit hard to understand but for those of use who grew up with the old James Cagney gangster movies it is a good parity. If you don't laugh at this movie you are either to young or to clinical.",1455667200,2,419,4.0602409638554215

7906117,2,B00000F0IC,"Except for brief appearances by Carol Lynley, it was a bore from first to last minute.

Actors didn't seem to interact.  Nothing could be taken seriously but neither could anything be taken lightly.

I watched it through to the end only because I like Ms. Lynley unconditionally.

Lynley's short closing speech was authentic, but so much so that it should have been in another movie.  Likewise, Palance burned with inner intensity.  All, however, to little effect.

Nothing clicked.",1301184000,2,482,5.102564102564102
7906118,2,B00000F0IC,"First a word about 'gray market' DVDs--
Often, transfers are not of the highest quality. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable), extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer.

THE FOUR DEUCES is the last film story from Don Martin, scripter of many forgettable 'B' pictures. This one's no different than his others, quality-wise.

Imaginative opening credits that feature comic book panels dissolving to live action are the highlight of this color-boosted Prohibition Era bomb. Jack Palance was by 1975 well into the tough guy parody phase of his career. When not lampooning himself Jack does what he can with a weak script. Co-star Carol Lynley looks good but seems to phone-in her performance from Jersey.

A deadly street feud between two rival gangs, one headed by Palance and his four capos (the deuces), plus tit-for-tat attacks on their competing speakeasys are main elements here. There's also more than a half-dozen neo-20s vocals to slow things down. Note that Jack's rotund crime boss rival has an equally weight-challenged 'songbird' at his club while Palance's girl singer is svelte in her bobbed hair and shimmy skirt. Frankly, I thought the big gal the better vocalist.

Saloon bust-ups and night time tommy gun raids get quickly monotonous. The largest of these bullet-riddled assaults (and the last of them) is spoiled by intentional camera undercranking that turns violence into unamusing cartoon movement.

Ultimately, ""Four Deuces"" is a waste of time. It's ONLY for Jack Palance fans with a high tolerance for cinematic mediocrities.",1255651200,4,1635,5.273076923076923
