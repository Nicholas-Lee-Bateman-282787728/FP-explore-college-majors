7986178,5,B00008OM8Q,"I found this series/package ~15 years ago and think it was the single best training series I ever found. I dropped my handicap by at least 15 strokes and understood more about the game than with any other aid I've ever used.

The reviewer who said it was complicated may have a point, but this series gives correct/proven methods and no bad ones.

Combine this with Harvey Penicks Little Red Book and beat your golf buddies like a drum.",1270080000,,436,4.506329113924051

7986180,2,B00008OM8Q,"Ever play golf with friends that want to be helpful by pointing out what you are doing wrong? It's fine as long as it doesn't exceed one or two pointers, but when you get forty or fifty things to correct, some of them in conflict with each other, how is this supposed to help?

Maybe if you are a golf advice junkie this would be a good approach, but for me it was overwhelming. I went in to sensory overload and just stopped watching the DVDs.

I cannot say that I got any pearls of wisdom from this series of DVDs, but I'll go back someday and finish watching them.",1167782400,,567,4.1454545454545455
