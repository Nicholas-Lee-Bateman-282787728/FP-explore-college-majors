But I was disappointed by the fact it was only about 40 minutes long and no special features with the exception of a few trailers and one Easter egg trailer (click on the ""geek's"" shopping bag in the trailer menu). It clearly states the run time on Amazon, but in my haste I neglected to look. It's an interesting slice of life about a place I will probably never have a chance to visit. But as a fan of all things comics, movies, games and animation, I found this movie barely scratches the surface. ""Manga Mad"" did a good job of that. Like I said, I liked it and don't regret the purchase, I had just hoped for more.",1425254400,,630,4.172131147540983
8149618,5,B000JBXP66,"I enjoyed learning about electric town but wished it had gone deeper into culture instead of just a few people. Still a really documentary and worth every penny, or yen.",1355011200,,169,4.666666666666667

While this video may not be as enchanting to all audiences, it is sure to entertain many different anime & manga fans out there.

Akihabara Geeks is a documentary that follows several different ""otaku"" around this interesting area, each person having a different interest. Some people only assume that Akihabara is an anime & manga themed area, which would only be partially true. While there's a sizable chunk of the area that is oriented towards that, the area is also home to several maid cafes as well as a booming electronics section.

As I've always wanted to visit this area (yet lack the money & time to visit), I was thrilled to watch this. I have to admit that I wasn't as interested in the electronics parts as I was the anime, manga & maid cafe oriented parts, but it was still fun to watch. My two absolute favorite parts in the movie had to be the following: the interview with Higurashi creator Ryukishi07 (his name is translated as ""Dragon Knight 07"" in this movie) as he described how he & several others formed the group 07th Expansion, as well as the depressed man who found a newfound appreciation for life when he discovered a discarded artwork of a beautiful anime/manga-style girl.

There's something for otaku of all types in this movie, but some may wish to rent this via Netflix (how I viewed it) rather than plunking down the money for it. It's a short movie & while it is interesting, it wasn't really something I'd watch over & over again enough to justify paying the price it is currently going for. (Around twenty dollars.)",1278547200,,1888,5.006369426751593

 Well, you get a peek at the lives of about 4 people actually. But its allmost like a japanese reality tv program, but i guess it is much more fitting to call it a documentary.

 It has good humor, i must say. I laughed out a loud at many parts.

Its even kinda touching in ways, becouse we see that stuff like anime, for instance, has such a strong influence on one young man's life.

 Also, the dedicated shop owner of a electronic parts store was interesting.

 We also see a designer of a very popular online game in japan.

 And theres a man who builds computers and trys to top and break his processing speed record. Which the documentary claims holds the record for fasted computer built.

 Plus, we get to meet a girl who dresses up in costumers at a resturant, who used to be very shy and not many friends, but the job has helped her not be alone anymore.

 Its a fun dvd, and sorta kinda inspiring in a way, to see the lives of people in japan who find meaning and worth in life through what theyve come to love. I didn't expect that at all really.

 I expected a hyper active insanly colorfull show on extremly fanatical anime and cosplay people in japan, but it ended up to be so much more than that, and has some depth.

 I love finding these movies, becouse i haven't gone to japan and i so very much wish to go, and this is pretty much all i have to see into a country and a culture ive loved for a long time.

 Its 45 minutes long, and though i thought that would be too short, it ended up that it seemed to be just the right length. Regardless though, i wish i could see more of stuff like this. I want another dvd by these people, i wanna see more, i would love a part 2.

 If you love japanese culture and love the anime lifestyle and dream of someday going to japan or even living there...this is one of the few resources i have seen out there that gave me a peek into anything regarding japanese day to day life.... so if you love this stuff...its definatly worth getting.

 I want more japanese documentaries like this. I hope AnimeWorks plans more volumes of this.

 Lastly, i think people who have ever found inspiration or influence through anime, through out life, will relate to this dvd. And don't forget, its funny aswell. So, have fun watching it. Its a little treasure.",1175817600,2,2452,4.273913043478261
8149621,4,B000JBXP66,"Akihabara Geeks is a short documentary film that takes a look at a day in the life of a few inhabitants of the neighborhood in Tokyo known as ""Electric Town"" which is the center of life for a lot of electronics, anime, and manga enthusiasts, which the narrator describes as ""geeks and fanatics"". The film alternates between 4 or 5 different Akibans with different interests and lifestyles. We follow one otaku who is obsessed with cute anime girls and plasters the walls of his tiny room with their posters and merchandise. He spends so much on his ""hobby"" that his average amount of money available for food each day is about five dollars! You might think this guy is weird or disturbing but later on in the film, his obsession is explained and you are able to understand him a bit better. For people interested in computers and videogames, Akihabara focuses on one man who is trying to build the world's fastest computer processor, called ""overclocking"". Then there is a fascinating look at how some people develop computer games independently of any big company and are able to sale around 100,000 copies and do quite well for themselves. Interviews with an employee of a maid cafe who is also a fulltime law student gives insight into why some women work in such places. Lastly, we are introduced to an older man who gave up his position in a big corporation to run his family's tiny electronics storefront in Akihabara. It's so cramped that he has to actually CRAWL into the booth!

This dvd was very enjoyable to me, because there are not that many dvds that give real-life tours of places of interest to people like me that are interested in the anime and manga sides of Japan and Tokyo. One thing I did not like about this show was that the narrator constantly refers to its subjects as ""geeks and fanatics"", which on the one hand makes me visualize nerds, and on the other, Islamic fundamentalists. It seems a real insult for the writers to look down upon the very people they investigating. After finishing the film, I didn't think any of the people in it were very different than you and me. Even the guy that was hooked on anime girls had his own very personal reasons for his passion, related to a dark period in his past. The maid girl too, joined the maid cafe because when she first got to Tokyo, it was a place where she felt comfortable and happy, so she wanted to impart that feeling to others. In the end, I think all of the Akibans shown were just passionate about what they are interested in, whether its computers, videogames, anime, serving others, or running a family business. Another complaint I have about his dvd was that it was too short, running about 45 minutes. I wanted to see more of the town and would have enjoyed more time in the anime and manga stores. If you are an otaku, or just interested in Japan, you should like this.",1169251200,10,2863,4.5484496124031
