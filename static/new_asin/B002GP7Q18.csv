8369898,5,B002GP7Q18,"Have been waiting a long time for this to become available in the USA!  This is my favorite of the three series (Tales From Green Valley (farming in the 1600s) Victorian Farm (late 1800s), and Edwardian Farm (early 1900s).  If you want wholesome family entertainment, with history made exciting and interesting, without any 'reality show' negative drama, this is for you!

POST SCRIPT: Love this series, but very upset to find upon it's arrival after ordering that this appears not to be formatted for USA DVD players, although this is nowhere mentioned by Amazon on it's site... will be contacting the Seller for a refund.  Highly disappointed that there was no indication on Amazon or even on the DVD set that it could not be viewed here.",1426118400,14,740,4.803149606299213
