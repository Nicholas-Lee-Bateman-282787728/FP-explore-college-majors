""Woodiefest / Loser""
""A Shaman's Shaman / The Gift""
""The Three Chiefs / The Party""
""The Beast / To Zaria With Love""
""Girls Only / Secession""

Overall, it's a nice set but the show is just kind of so-so. It's not the best Nicktoon, but it's not the worst either.",1259366400,,346,4.564516129032258
8258691,5,B0015I2S8I,"My kids and I caught Tak one Saturday morning and its a cartoon that actually makes them (and me) laugh out loud. Very cute characters with funny story lines. My only regret is that there are no more episodes available on DVD!

My kids are ages 2 and 5 and both enjoy it equally as its something new!",1232668800,,300,4.172413793103448
8258692,5,B0015I2S8I,"Tak is a newer show that came on Nick about a year ago and it is based on a popular game series. The series is funny and mostly entertaining. So if you are looking for a good show...then Tak is it.

While it may not be a good as some other Nick shows, it still has its entertaining moments. This DVD contains several episodes from the series and they're available for a good cheap price.

I recommend that it should be viewed at least once. So buy now and enjoy!!!",1227484800,,464,4.144444444444445
