Even if you don't have arthritis, these simple excercises are great for prevention. If you know someone who has arthritis they NEED this DVD!",1238976000,3,273,4.956521739130435
2913438,5,B000U0G3W4,"Once again, a video from YMAA that is as soothing and gentle as it is powerful. I appreciate the range of exercises that includes some wonderful massage instruction. I really enjoy the slow pace, gentle voice-over, and hypnotic nature of the exercises.

I have several other YMAA DVD's and books, and come back to them over and over again. I can honestly say that every one of them is really well-done.

THANKS to YMAA - highly recommended.",1231113600,5,440,4.701298701298701
2913439,5,B000U0G3W4,"Dr. Yang has once again provided us with an easy to follow, easy to learn and entertaining DVD. Whether you are burdened by arthritis or not, the exercises shown by Dr. Yang are simple to do and you still get your Quigong exercises for the day. I find that after following the demonstration I feel relaxed, comfortable and yet still have the feeling that I have just been through a good work-out. My energy level picks up and my circulation has improved. I believe that the blood circulation alleviates whatever arthritis problem I may have.

While this DVD is recommended for beginners, I would recommend this for those more advanced as well.",1231027200,4,643,4.741071428571429
2913440,3,B000U0G3W4,"This DVD is more suited for beginners- clean video picture and sound.
Good explanation of Qi gong and good amount of short exercises are presented.

I've found so far, the YMAA videos are too long. A lot of information is redundant and makes the viewing too long before you get to the meat of the subject.",1229904000,8,305,4.446428571428571
2913441,5,B000U0G3W4,"This is an excellent DVD for dealing with arthritis.  Additionally, even if one does not suffer the effects of arthritis, the exercises on this DVD will still maintain one's health and possibly prevent the onset of arthritis.

Locally, there is a Taijiquan group called the Taijiquan Tutelage of Palo Alto, CA.  The former leader/main consultant of the group was Wu Ta-yeh.  He studied under Tung, Hu-ling, who was the son of Tung, Ying-chieh.  Tung, Ying-chieh was the main student of Yang Cheng Fu in the last twenty years of Yang's life.

Allegedly, Wu Ta-yeh suffered from an arthritic condition in his forties which prevented him from being able to hold a pen and sign his name.  He learned Taijiquan and lived into his late eighties.  According to his biography on the organization's home page, he rarely suffered any medical problems, including arthritis, for the last thirty years or so of his life.

In my own family my mother has suffered arthritic pain in her hands.  After using the Qigong balls, so commonly found in any Chinese community, she was able to alleviate the pain and suffering from arthritis.  The balls are usually metal and two of them are rolled around the palm of the hand, causing one to focus on the hands while attempting to roll them around each other.

By focusing on the hand and doing a non-load bearing exercise incorporating circular movements and coordination, Qi is directed to the area, allowing the body to heal itself.  As I was watching this DVD I was not surprised to see Master Yang using these Chinese balls to demonstrate an exercise.  They are very effective and low in cost.

Approximately a year ago I apparently had appendicitis for eight days, prior to having an operation to remove my appendix.  During the eight days I found myself covering my lower abdomen with my right palm, with the left palm sitting on top of the right hand while I rubbed my abdomen in a clockwise circular movement.  Somehow, it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.  While watching this DVD I was surprised to see the same exercise being offered by Master Yang.

After my operation, the surgeon remarked to me that he had never heard of anyone having appendicitis for eight days without the appendix bursting.  When I told him that I taught and practiced Taijiquan and Qigong, he said that was probably the reason that it had not burst.  He also said that when he operated, he was surprised at how little swelling there was of the appendix.  I attribute this to my generally good health as well as the qigong massage that I was administering to myself.

The surgeon also stated that I had a surprising amount of abdomen muscles.  I don't do crunches or lift weights, but I practice extensively moving my waist separate from my hips, which stretches and exercises the abdominal muscles.  On this DVD, at the very beginning, you can see Master Yang practicing just such an exercise.

Well, I guess my point is that the exercises on this DVD work, and I've got personal and family experience with their beneficial effects.

A point well made by Master Yang in the beginning of the DVD is that if one practices these qigong exercises, the internal organs will be strengthened, which is an important part of the process of healing and dealing with arthritis.  Only when you have healthy organs can you have a sufficient amount of Qi, which provides a much greater chance of having excellent health.

When I started to watch this DVD, I found myself following and performing the exercises Master Yang is seen doing in the background while the narrator talks about Qigong theory, etc...  I normally do not take follow along while reviewing a DVD, but somehow as I watched this DVD, I immediately began emulating the exercises presented.

I recently had as a guest in my home one of the applicant/students for Master Yang's ten year retreat/school.  The following morning, the student and I went out to practice some martial arts.  I recall watching him do some of the exercises that are on this DVD.  These exercises, although they are presented as useful in the treatment of arthritis, are also very beneficial to everyone, even those not suffering from arthritis.

As Master Yang is seen demonstrating the various exercises during the introduction, detailed information is provided about what the exercise is accomplishing and why it is effective for dealing with arthritis.
Throughout the whole DVD, Master Yang is seen doing various exercises while a narrator talks about various related concepts.  Useful training tips are given near the end of the DVD.

Besides the exercises for the organs, exercises are also demonstrated for the neck, spine, waist, hands, wrist, elbows, shoulders, legs, feet and hips.  That pretty much covers the whole body.

This DVD has the following sections covering the different aspects of Arthritis Qigong.

Then it shows endless footage of massaging the lower dantien, followed by endless footage of massaging just above the lower dantien, ... Then the chest and so forth.

I really question how many arthritis sufferers can sit flat with knees out and soles of feet facing in order to massage the soles.  Really??

 About this time the video started flickering with gray patches and eventually just weren't black.  There are much better productions available. Save your money.",1418342400,6,622,4.866666666666666

There is not a twenty-minute workout with music or anything like that. It's more like a seminar. You learn about the general principles of Qigong and its applications to those with arthritis, and then practice enough of each very simple movement to repeat it later on your own.

2913462,5,B000U0G3W4,"I started practicing Qigong 3 years ago. I have a large collection of books and DVDs on Qigong, most of them by Dr Yang Ywing Ming. When I came on Amazon and came across this DVD, I decided to add it to my collection. I watched it as soon as it arrived, but did not immediately put the movements into practice because I was busy doing my other Qigong movements. One day, however, when I was walking on my treadmill, I started feeling some nasty pain on my right ankle. Every step on the treadmill, my ankle would hurt. I got off the treadmill, looked for the DVD and searched for the movements specifically recommended for the ankles. I did a few repetitions, maybe ten or twelve with each foot, and the next day repeated the same procedure. The next time I got on my treadmill, my ankle was no longer hurting and has never hurt again since that day so I decided to add these qigong movements for arthritis to my daily qigong routine.

I have no words to express my admiration and gratitude towards Dr Yang Ywing Ming and this wonderful ancient art named Qigong which, needless to say, I will practice for as long as I live. I highly recommend this DVD as well as all of his other DVDs on Qigong, including the series Understanding Qigong, which those more intellectually oriented will greatly appreciate.",1373673600,10,1305,4.483193277310924

2913465,3,B000U0G3W4,"There are numerous exercises.  Some are more like massage and require another person to perform.  I watched and tried a few things, but they really didn't make sense.

2913469,5,B000U0G3W4,"This was an informative and easy to understand video with good production values.  The instruction is clear and simple, and multiple camera angles are utilized.  These exercises are intended for arthritis relief, but could probably be applied to any joint injury or inflammation.  A companion book offers greater detail and explanation, but the DVD stands alone as a complete instructional.  I was well impressed with the quality of this video.",1242777600,8,444,5.3
2913470,5,B000U0G3W4,"YMAA has asked me to review this DVD based on my almost 30 years in the martial arts. I have to admitt to being happy about snagging this assignment for selfish reasons. I had knee surgery and knew I would be limited in what I'd be able to do for a while. So I thought this would be a great time to branch out in my kiko (chinese qigong) practice. The exercises are perfect for someone who needs to keep their joints loose and supple. If you have arthritis I would check with you doctor before doing any of the exercises just as a general warning. Like all qigong exercises these look easy but they are challenging at their own level. If you are a beginner and have never done qigong before then this is a good place to start. There's lots of explanation and you can see the moves easily.

Another person says that the DVD drags and is too long before you ""get to the meat"". I can only say that if you slow down you'll get a more harmonious outcome. The DVD tries to slow down a persons pace as they enter into qigong practice. If you are in a hurry qigong is not for you. If after a few times you recognize an exercise and feel comfortable with it you can always press the magical fast forward button.

I personally found this quite beneficial after my knee surgery...that is after I got to the stage where unadded standing was allowed. It got the juices flowing again and prepped me for more rigourous physcial training. If you are interested in a more general simple qigong practice get Dr. Yang's ""Simple 8 Brocade"" DVD. I've been practicing it for years but I still learned a lot from it.",1242172800,32,1593,4.306666666666667
8211686,5,B000U0G3W4,Simple Exercises for Arthritis:  This DVD can and should be be used with Dr. Yang's book  Arthritis Relief.

The degree of relief also depends on the severity of arthritis.  Both my wife (M.D.) and myself (Ph.

8211693,4,B000U0G3W4,"Many M.D.'s have begun to reccomend patients practice ""Tai Chi"" (taijiquan/ Tai Chi Chuan) as there is a growing evidence base that such excercises are effective at relieving pain, preventing falls, benefiting congnition, and improving wellness. As a long term student of Taijiquan I dearly love the art, but I also recognize that it is complicated and sometimes difficult for people to learn if they don't want to devote considerable time.  This may not always be practicable for people who are looking for pain relief and modest health benefits but may not have the inclination to learn complex routines. These simplified excercises are excellent and can provide improved function and mobility for many patients who may not be able to pursue taijiquan.  As a practitioner of Chinese medicine, I often recomend excercises like these to patients with pain conditions of all kinds, or those looking for a simple practice to benefit theri overall health.  The only critique I have would be that the menu is not as easily navigable as some of Dr. Yang's other DVDs, but the content is still very good. I believe that the accompanying book is excellent and very helpful but the majority of patients, in particular those who may be elderly or have no previous experience with qigong or martial arts, may have an easier time with video instruction.",1447372800,2,1342,4.982142857142857
