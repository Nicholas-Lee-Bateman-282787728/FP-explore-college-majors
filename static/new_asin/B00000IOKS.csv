1227145,4,B00000IOKS,"Gahh, I love this anime. I bought it on a whim after seeing the ad on my friend's MKR videos. It's so cute, I love it! I adore anime that is whimsical and cute like this one, not really meant to be taken seriously,  just fun. I really like it, though I was disappointed in the style change  from episode 1 to 2. Does anyone know, is this a piggy-back style story?  That would explain the change in Rouge's look {and hair color *sob*}. But  in any case, I adore this anime. The 2nd episode makes me cry every time I  see it! {""Regulus!"" *sniffle*} If anyone feels the same, please  contact me! I'm always looking for me info... SUBTITLE THE NEXT EPISODES,  ANIMEWORKS!  ^.^ Or else.",950140800,,681,4.307086614173229
1227146,5,B00000IOKS,"This is one anime that is a MUST SEE. Be prepared to be left of with a mild clifhanger, as the BAKA Animeworrks may not subtitle the rest of the series. The more popularity this gains, the more likely they will. I have  to wonder why this is so un-heard of. Me, I've see crazt off-the-wall stuff  NO ONE has seen (exept a few peeps) like this, Saint Tail, and the  adventures of the mini Goddesses. Buy this if you liked MAgic Knight  Rayearth and Fushigi Yugi. You're sure to love it. PG-13 for brief nudity  (think BARBIE), swearing, and suggested mature theams. Anyone who is into  anime will have no prob here. THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR CHINDREN! THOSE WHO  THINK ALL ANImATION IS FOR KIDS, NEED TO WATH SOME ANIME!",948153600,,718,4.393939393939394
7911223,5,B00000IOKS,"Princess Rouge is perfect for anyone who loves mystery, romance,and a sad ending. Though it is only two episodes long, it captured me within the first five minutes. The mysterious girl, Rouge, falls out of the sky landing on Yusuke,a high school student, and has no memory of who she is or where she comes from. All she remembers is her name. Being the nice guy he is, Yusuke decides to take care of her until she remembers who she is, but watch out, here come her two sisters to take her back. The mysteries of her past begin to unravel. Very moving. I honestly cried harder at the end of the second episode then I have at any movie ever in my life, but I won't ruin the wonderful love story for you ^.~",1076198400,,704,4.222222222222222
7911224,4,B00000IOKS,"A girl appears from out of nowhere.  A shy, awkward boy takes her in.  The girl's sisters appear and begin to cause trouble for the couple.  Sound familiar?  On the surface, it appears that this is little more than a cookie-cutter anime in the spirit of ""Ah! My Goddess"".  But a closer look reveals that there may have been more at work.  The anime attempts to combine two aspects of the ""magical girl"" genre: the fighting, transforming magic girl and the sweet, loving, sensitive magic girl who uses her power in service of her man.  Think of this as ""Ah! My Goddess"" meets ""Sailor Moon.""  The results are quite interesting.  Furthermore, the characters seem deceptively flat.  On the surface it appears that Rouge is cut straight out of the ""Belldandy"" mold, but as the story progresses, it appears as though there may be a dark side to her past.  What was her true nature?  What kind sibling rivalry did she have with her sisters?  Unfortunately, these questions will have to go unanswered since it doesn't appear as though this series will be completed.  On the up side, this makes excellent fodder for any fan fiction writer out there.",1017446400,,1140,4.691919191919192
7911225,5,B00000IOKS,"Princess Rouge is the two episode story about a girl named Rouge who falls from the sky. High School student Yusuke accidentally breaks her fall, and promises to care for her until Rouge's memory returns. Things are going very well for the two lovebirds until, shock upon shock, her two forgotten sisters find them (in an almost Ah My Goddess reminicent scene). I haven't watched much anime aside from dubs, but this is absolutly a must buy for all fans of shojo anime, or any other type of anime. Magic, mystery, mayhem and love. What more could a fan want?",997660800,,558,4.59
7911226,5,B00000IOKS,"sadly, Princess rouge is cut short after only two episodes, but it's alrigt, it's worth the money! A strange girl (obviously named Rouge) falls out of the sky landing on top of a boy already late for school. She's unconcious, and he decides to take her home so she can awake in a nice bed. When she does, however, she doesn't remember anything (we see some of what happened during her sleeping) about where she came from, and how she got to earth. So he takes care of her, and you feel bad fro him because she reminds him of his deceased parents (e. his mom). Her sisters come to take her back, and a scary winged bad guy woman comes to......BWAHAHAHAHAHA! It's a great series, I highly recommend it and the soundtrack. The theme song is so sweetly sad you just want to die, it makes the show. Watch the show. Enjoy the show. Lather, wash, repeat.",994118400,,847,4.367088607594937
7911227,4,B00000IOKS,"-they ended the series after only two episodes! Can you believe it!? Just when it was getting so good, too! Other than that, I have no complaints. The story is interesting. It has romance, adventure and only a little violence. It is mysterious too. The animation is beautiful and colourful and the music is the best. Princess Rouge is a wonderful anime, and I recommend it to all those who enjoy shoujo (girl) anime and even those who don't should look into it.",992822400,,461,4.566265060240964
7911228,5,B00000IOKS,"Princess Rouge is a very well made movie with dazzling effects and a very nice story line.  Enter Yusuke, a high school student who just happens to be a little too late a little too often.  However his lateness just happens  to place him in the middle of a rainstorm just in time to be thrown into a  rather large puddle with a young girl who remembers nothing except her  name.  Her name happens to be Rouge. After spending a couple days together  Rouge decides to leave Yuskue, after she leaves Yuskue comes home to  discover not Rouge but her 2 sisters Keige and Meige who jsut happen to be  princesess of the underworld.  Princess Rouge is a very good movie, but  parents should be advised to follow the ages 13 and up warning due to  nudity, slightly heavy cursing, and a kind of grim depiction of the  underworld.",962236800,5,819,4.416107382550336
7911229,5,B00000IOKS,"There are spoilers in people's reviews below mine... aparently some people just don't mind ruining it for you. A dub IS coming out. This has some nudity. 13+. Ok, these are the ONLY EPISODES OF PRINCESS ROUGE! THERE ARE  NO MORE, YET... NOT IN AMERICA OR JAPAN.",956016000,6,261,4.553191489361702
7911230,5,B00000IOKS,"This movie was sooo cute!  Usually, I study up on an anime before I go and buy it (you know, checking out to see what other people have said about it), but this one, I saw in the store where I was working and just bought  it, having heard absolutely NOTHING about it before buying it.  It was SO  sweet and cute!  If you like the romantic comedy kindsa things, you should  get this video!",951609600,,388,4.1066666666666665
7911231,5,B00000IOKS,"The movie is about a Princess that ends up on earth, not remembering anything but her name. She meets Yusuke who is a high school student that takes her in until she regains her memory. They end up falling in love but  Rogue's enemies are threatening to split them up. I hope the next episodes  come out soon so I find out what happens!",951436800,,336,4.234375
7911232,4,B00000IOKS,"We both saw the previews to PR off the MKR videos (rock!) and just had to get it. The movie's great, but they seriously need to sub the other episodes. And it's like, soooo wrong of them to cut her hair. NOOOOO! And..  and.. Regulus shouldn't have died! IIIIIEEEEEE!",950918400,2,266,4.428571428571429
