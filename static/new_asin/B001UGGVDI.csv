3798261,4,B001UGGVDI,"This movie is about an irresponsible young couple, Dina (Miranda Bailey) and Ron (Waylon Payne) that live in their car with no means of support. When they find out they are knocked up, they see their unborn baby as a way to make money by selling it on the internet  to  a prospective couple...Paul (Jeffery Donavan) and Maria (Leonor Varella). They come together and things go well as until the baby's biological father can keep his true nature under control. He gets angry and slaps his pregnant girlfriend which makes the adoptive father question whether or not they are making the right choice with this adoption. It is from this point that things start beginning to take twists and turns. You may be able to predict how the movie is going to end, but the trip to the end is an enjoyable one. The actors deliver well enough and the plot has enough turns to keep people guessing. There's enough gore to keep the spatter crowd entertained, and some depth for those of us who like to look in to film a little more deeply. All in all, definitely worth your time.",1258502400,13,1061,4.520833333333333
3798262,2,B001UGGVDI,"Hindsight (Paul Holahan, 2008)

It never fails to amaze me what idiots some people are. You may remember a hue and cry a couple of months (as I write this) ago over the movie Orphan from all the usual suspects, organizing boycotts and such because of the movie's controversial portrayal of adoption. (None of the protestors, of course, ever actually saw the movie; they never do.) And yet there was, from the same braindead morons, a terrific vacuum surrounding Hindsight, considered by more than a few critics to be one of the best films of 2008 and (since it never got wide theatrical release) ranking high on IFC's list of must-see movies for Summer 2009, which makes Orphan's dysfunctionality look like it came straight from the set of Ozzie and Harriet. I find myself confused, to say the least. Perhaps even more confused than I find myself by those woefully misguided critics who seemed to have loved it so (not to mention whatever portion of the IFC staff had forgotten to eat their Wheaties before watching this half-baked mess).

Hindsight is the story of a broke, criminal trailer-trash couple, Dina (The Oh in Ohio's Miranda Bailey) and Ron (Walk the Line's Waylon Payne), who decide, when confronted with an unwanted pregnancy, to sell the baby over the Internet. They find Maria (Blade II's Leonor Varela) and Paul (Burn Notice's Jeffrey Donovan), who, they say, have gone through every legal channel without success, and are willing to barter in black market babies. Problem is, neither side of this equation is being quite square with the other, and the misunderstandings soon spiral out of control...

If that sounds like the plot of half the torture porn movies you've ever seen, but without any of the violence that lends those movies prurient interest, then you've hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't help that every plot synopsis of the movie you'll find gives away the big plot twist halfway through the film (I tried to dance around it as much as I could; most are far more explicit, some actually giving away both sides of the duplicity), which robs the film of any sort of suspense it might have held. (The movie's framing device, which also gives the movie its title, also robs it of much of the suspense.) This probably could have been an above-average psychological thriller given a couple more script rewrites, but what we actually get is as run-of-the-mill as they come. **",1251331200,3,2410,4.8024096385542165

8343629,2,B001UGGVDI,"I wanted to like this movie but the storytelling was very poor. How two people living in a stolen car with no money, or anything else apparently, found the resources and time to surf the internet for weeks and weeks to locate a couple to sell their unborn baby to is equally baffling to how it all plays out. I think the girl is (spoiler! maybe?) posthumously telling her story to ""Peter' after he picks her up hitchhiking and he explains the errors of her ways.  I like the twist that the ""normal"" people are equally screwed up but the story, setting, and premise are not fully fleshed out. I mean, Peter, Paul, and Mary are the main characters names, I'm surprised the housing development wasn't called ""The Pearly Gates"". Disturbing, confusing, and boring at the same time.",1391385600,,776,4.6231884057971016
8343630,2,B001UGGVDI,"The official synopsis for the 2008 movie HINDSIGHT makes things seem a bit more ominous than they really are.  ""When an unexpectedly pregnant--and broke--couple lists their baby for adoption on the internet to score an upfront payment, they're lured into a twisted, sadistic game of desperation and deception.""

As the 10th Doctor would say, ""Wellllllllll...""

What really happens is Ron and Dina, a dirt bag couple who make their living stealing cars and skipping out on hotel and restaurant bills, find themselves expecting.  Dina doesn't want a baby and decides they'll sell it to the highest bidder.  They get several offers but the couple they pick, the couple that offers the most money, is Maria and Paul, a successful doctor and lawyer who live in a model home on an up-and-coming development site.

As the delivery date gets closer, Ron and Dina go to Paul and Maria's to finally meet them in person, and to collect the down payment on their baby.  The plan, however, is to take the money and run without actually giving them the baby.  I'm not sure why this is the plan when Dina said right away she didn't want to keep the baby, but it's the plan, so it's all we've got to go on.

Paul thinks something is up almost right away and after Ron backhands Dina when they lose a round of Picture Perfect the two couples are playing, he tells them the deal's off, get out.  Ron tries to calm him down, but Paul's already figured out they're only there for the money and have no intention of handing over the baby.  Maria, however, has been trying to have a baby for five years and tells them she'll get them their deposit, as long as they agree she gets the baby.

Won't matter, Paul says.  He put the money back in the bank that morning.  Maria doesn't have it.

Then, suddenly, before Paul can make them leave, Maria has a seizure brought on by her diabetes.  Ron and Dina take their chance and lock the couple in the laundry room while they search the house for the money they know Paul didn't really take to the bank.

Things escalate from there and soon the two couples are going at each other with everything they've got.  Ron gets stabbed multiple times, Maria threatens Dina with a syringe full of air to the jugular, and Paul gets the crap kicked out of him all over the garage.  The ending isn't hard to figure out and was, honestly, not very satisfying.  Not to mention the entire story is told in flashback with a very very incredibly weak and cheesy wraparound story of Dina hitchhiking and telling everything that happened to Peter--and trust me, the end of this thing, once everything clicks into place concerning this wraparound narrative, it's not clever, it's just groan-inducing.

Brooke Purdy wrote the screenplay, and it appears to be her only one.  I'm not surprised at all.  The plot structure is predictable, the narrative is tedious and the characters are annoying as hell.  The only bright spot, for me, was Jeffrey Donovan (""Burn Notice"") who exudes a confidence and an energy as Paul that none of the others could match, even though he seems, on paper, to be the most boring character of the bunch.

Waylon Payne (WALK THE LINE) as Ron is annoying and unsettling while Miranda Bailey (UNEARTHED) as Dina is just plain oblivious.  As Peter tries to tell her on the drive, she brought this on herself, and he's right.  But her character refuses to take any responsibility and continues to blame everyone else for her rotten life.  Sure, an argument can be made that if a character bothers me so much then it's got to be a strong, well-defined character, right?  If I thought there was any sort of depth to a character like that, I would probably agree.  But Dina is the way she is because she grew up in foster homes and no one cared for her and life is tough and you have to take what you want and blah blah blah.

Leonor Varela (""Arrested Development"") as Maria hints at hidden layers of depth below the surface, and we see glimpses of it here and there--there's the hypodermic full of air, then she considers cutting the baby out of Dina,--and Varela does a good job of showing those wheels turning.  But in the end, Maria is a woman obsessed with having a baby, nothing more.  All of those hidden layers to her personality, I began to suspect, had nothing to do with Maria as a person and everything to do with moving the plot forward.

Paul Holahan directed, and his background as a television director (""Burn Notice"", ""Fringe"", ""Castle"") comes through loud and clear.  If not for the language, I'd have guessed this was a made-for-TV movie.  Everything plays pretty safe and unoriginal.

It's an aptly-titled movie and the whole point of it is the choices we make in life and how they lead us to where we are.  Sure it's deep stuff, but in the end, as the credits are rolling, it doesn't really make any difference.  Even after all that's happened and Dina is relating her story to Peter, she still blames Maria and Paul for what happened, which, in my opinion, negates the entire impact of the movie's message.

I got this movie as part of a 4-pack of horror films, but that's not totally the case because HINDSIGHT is nothing more than TV drama.  Give the dialogue a few cuts here and there to make it TV-friendly and this could have been a Lifetime movie without missing a beat.  If you like that sort of thing, by all means you might enjoy this one.  But if you're shopping the horror section and you see this DVD, skip it, it's definitely not what you're looking for.",1379116800,,5508,4.549238578680203
