8685130,3,B00OW6XC26,"If the picture had been restored, rather than issued as an unimproved transfer of a poor print from the wasteland of public-domain films, I'd give this at least four stars. It's a nifty thriller, well-made by Universal budget, with a witty script by Jean Negulesco, good direction by John Brahm and a solid cast, but what makes it special is Basil Rathbone. This man was a splendid stage-trained actor who was both the definitive Sherlock Holmes and the greatest swashbuckler villain of all time. When it came to swordplay, he always made his hero-adversaries look terrific, whether they were expert fencers themselves (like Tyrone Power) or not very good with a blade at all (Errol Flynn, believe it or not). Here he plays a slick anti-hero, a swindler and a cad who steals the show. According to the censorship rules of the time he can't win, but we wish he could.",1434153600,,866,4.741721854304636
8685131,4,B00OW6XC26,"This fine Universal B from the great movie year of 1939 is as close as the renowned English actor ever came to a traditional leading man role. That said, he's a bad guy but the other fellows are worse guys. It's a most enjoyable movie, but as far as I know there's never been a restoration, so the quality is pretty awful. This is usually true for public-domain movies because no one owns the rights. The formidable Victor McLaglen and the talented Sigrid Gurie share top billing, and the solid supporting cast includes future star Robert Cummings. The plot is fast-moving and pleasurably sordid.",1418688000,,596,4.740384615384615
