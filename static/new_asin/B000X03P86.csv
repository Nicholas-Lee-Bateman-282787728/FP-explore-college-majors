8226293,5,B000X03P86,"The description of this movie given above is completely wrong! This is the BBC documentary from 1989 about John Davidson, a 15-year-old schoolboy from Galashiels who suffers from the most severe form of Tourette's Syndrome, a complex neurological disorder. This fascinating and inspiring film explores the way in which John, his family and the local community deal with his extreme condition.

This DVD also contains footage from the 2002 BBC follow-up documentary, The Boy Can't Help It, featuring John, now aged 31, as he talks about how much impact the original documentary had on his life. John's charity, Tourette's Scotland, will be receiving a donation for every copy sold to continue helping and advising families of Tourette's sufferers.",1222819200,,746,5.322033898305085
