8588913,3,B00D39UQ9U,"I gave this one a shot recently because of the interesting plot and some decent reviews I read about. I can't say that it's some lost gem, but it's also not a terrible film. The film is fairly well made, despite it's cheap production. The acting is pretty good, though 80% of it follows just only one character. This is foreign film and the dialogue (which is minimal) is dubbed. But with that being said, the voice acting is just plain bad! So if you have the option of watching the film in its original language with subtitles, I really suggest viewing the film that way. My other major gripe with this one is the pacing. There are many lulls in the film that seem to drag out just too long. I suppose it was done to build suspense, and again, since the majority of the film is just a guy wondering around by myself in the woods, something has to fill up the running time of the film. But in most cases, it just seems to drag out for too long and its usually not worth the payoff. The violence and gore is pretty sparse in this one too. So if that's your thing, you're probably going to be disappointed. The twist ending to this one is what most people talk about, but if you seen enough of this kind of films, you're probably gonna guess what's going on a lot sooner than its revealed. Overall, this one is worth watching, but its nothing to get excited about.",1391558400,,1363,4.2664092664092665

8588915,3,B00D39UQ9U,"This s one of those movie listing with an overblown blurb about how groundbreaking it is, promising  a twist to blow your mind. It looks good, the acting is OK, I was drawn into the confusion and dread THEN.....Ugh.

My mind was decidedly not blown and the twist was more of a half-turn. Thinking back, afterward, the whole thing felt overlong and stale.",1378598400,,354,4.603174603174603
8588916,3,B00D39UQ9U,"Ritual was a very cheaply made film, you could tell by the effects of lack there of. The sets were cheap and the acting just ok.
The main thing that saves this film from being a total bust was that it was really quite clever in an insane bizarre way,

there is a twist, although one that I saw coming a mile away but then it builds on that twist and this is where the insanity comes in. The use of video camera plays a huge part in the plot but that is all I can say. If you don't mind watching a movie just for the payoff at the middle of the third act then watch it but I wasn't very entertained leading up to the 'pay off""..

Again for the budget that must have been micro it wasn't that bad but I wouldn't watch it again. It 'is'very memorable so that say's something for it. The gore scale was like a 1 out of 10 and very poorly done at that.",1378512000,,847,3.8901734104046244
