8253956,5,B0014127VE,"I may be aging myself, but I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and always remembered it.  Some months ago my wife and I rescued a dog from along a highway out in the middle of nowhere.  It seemed nobody wanted or ever wanted this poor dog and had just dumped him.  He was alone in the world.  We took the dog to the vet and after $1500+ in vet costs we had a nice, healthy dog who gives us joy and loves his new home.  When we picked him up and made the decision to keep him the only name I could think of to call him was Shep, having remmebered the name from this movie.  He didn't look like the Shep in the movie, but the fact that he was alone in the world and just wanted to belong to somebody and ""take care"" of them made his name choice evident.  My wife had never seen the movie so I went on line and saw that Amazon offered it for sale on DVD.  It's not too bad as far as quality goes, it's black and white, but what a great story.  After my wife saw the movie she agreed... yes, Shep was the right name for our new-found dog.  I recommend this DVD just because it's such a nice story and has a lot of good lessons in the storyline.",1271980800,10,1150,3.8553191489361702
