7869839,1,6304401868,"One of George Clooney's earlier efforts, RED SURF is about as exciting as doing dishes.  Murky editing, tedious plotting and mediocre acting help in sinking this tale of drug dealers who decide to do one last job before trying out respectable lives.  Joining Clooney are Doug Savant (Melrose Place), Deedee Pfeiffer (Grease 2 - she must like being in unintended disaster movies), and Philip McKeon (whose only purpose is to spout profanities in each line of dialogue).  Nothing to recommend this forgettable flick.",1117324800,,514,5.168674698795181
7869840,3,6304401868,"I was impressed with young, handsome George Clooney in this movie.  The script wasn't bad though it had a weak ending. DeDee Pfieffer was very good.",1055203200,3,148,4.6923076923076925
7869841,3,6304401868,This is a good film thanks to the great acting talent of one George Clooney. Before his ER Days and major movie stardom  Clooney played a  surfer who suffers a injury turns to the drug running business to make a  living. But things get out of hand when his girlfriend decides to leave him  and gets himself invovled with a dangerous drug dealer. Most of the film is  pretty much formaulic but it's still worthwhile wacthing. When seeing this  film it's hard not to notice the acting talent Clooney has and has  accumlated since then. A great film to watch if you want to see Clooney's  earlier work.,965779200,6,599,4.481481481481482
7869842,2,6304401868,What a piece of work this is. Watching George Clooney run around with long hair and pretend to be a drug runner? Come on... No wonder this movie never recieved a theatrical release. Bad acting lighting and really bad camera  work sink this shipwreck. To bad the tides couldn't have washed this film  out to sea.,959990400,5,311,4.535714285714286
