8364594,4,B002CXBRK0,"This 2 disk compendium of some of the weirder 'loops' in 42nd Street Pete's vast collection of ancient erotica definitely fulfills the promise of:""Something To Offend Everyone!""

Perhaps the first thing that's gonna 'offend' a lot of 'modern' viewers is the (relatively) horrible visual quality of, pretty much all, of these depraved little vignettes. Filmed & presented, as they were, in the diminutive 8mm format - and originally shot in generally less than professional circumstances - these short films are about as grainy and degenerated as possible while still conveying a visual image. It CAN be frustrating, with our modern expectation of digitally clear images, to strain the eyes to see details and facial features amidst the dancing scratches & bad lighting that characterized the 'grindhouse experience' - BUT - for those willing to give it a try - this double disk set of 'extreme sleaze' offers some perverse scenarios not likely to be found in modern day porn.

Pete (accompanied by the comely, albeit silent, fetish diva: Lili St Claire) intros each of the brief loops with a bit of a synopsis of the action contained there-in. His info is (unfortunately) not particularly informative per any 'background' to the loop(s) on display - but he does call attention to some of the 'peculiarities' of the carnal action presented - which is a good thing! because some of it would, doubtless, elude the casual viewer. Pete has dug deep into his trove to find this batch of aberrant fun and the emphasis is on the 'rough' and 'strange' end of the erotic spectrum. Pretty much every 'popular' deviant fetish is represented by a loop or two - both in color and glorious B&W. While most of the 'actors' are nameless 'one shot wonders' - some 'classic adult stars' put in 'early career' appearance - including XXX 'Deep Throat' superstar (to be) Linda Lovelace who features prominently in 2 separate loops that are particularly 'bent'.

The disk has an 'extra' with Pete talking about the 'bad old days' of under the counter porn - when many of the little 5 minute film loops sold for as much as $100.00 each! - which makes this (20+ !) 'loop' collection a heck of a deal! For real 'grindhouse' devotees I'd suggest that you: 'adjust your expectations accordingly' - sharpen up the 'old eyes', and prepare to be 'amazed' by some of the wild stuff that free-lovin' folks back in the 'sick 70's' were committing to celluloid.

It should be noted that all of the actual 'loops' are presented (as per original release) without ANY sound - other than the superimposed film projector 'clatter' - no cheesy music or narration to distract from the 'experience'. There is a goodly helping of previews (on both disks) to lure one to further explorations into the degenerate(d) world of period porn. As Pete himself admonishes: ""Stay Sick!""",1380499200,2,2832,4.89375
8364595,3,B002CXBRK0,"I had forgotten how bad some of the porn out of the seventies really was.  These are fuzzy prints, not remastered and have the flicker effect of an old 8m running as you watch.  It could be fun at a party if not for the interuptions of the host and the half hour of promos at the begining.  If you looking for real sleaze; watersports, incest, or painful BDSM this isn't the place to go.  Most of the sleaze here is in the filming! dianefromcarroll@yahoo.com",1348358400,2,458,4.352941176470588
