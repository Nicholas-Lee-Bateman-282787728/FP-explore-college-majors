2624965,2,B000H0M4BG,"Ed Burns broke into the New York film world with a bang, but it seems he didn't have much to say after his first movie. Looking for Kitty might just be the weakest of his films. The male bonding is clichd and a little unbelievable; goody-two-shoes Abe is never a compelling character, so you spend most of the movie not giving a damn whether he finds his wife - and understanding why she left him in the first place. Understated, yet powerful and moving, the end is the only thing that's of value in this movie.",1177545600,,511,4.333333333333333
2624966,5,B000H0M4BG,"If the slice-of-life, small independent film makes a comeback, it will owe a lot to Ed Burns and his great pictures.  Looking for Kitty had a brief theatrical run, but hopefully will find its audience on DVD.  It's a fantastic gem that's injected with a more thoughtful, even melancholy beat, juxtaposed with sincere humor and a great eye for the camera.  Burns also knows how to properly use music in film to capture the emotional heart of it.  All of these are trademarks of Burns' films and this one is no exception.

Burns loves New York and that much is readily clear in Looking for Kitty, a reflection of two lost and lonely men that if not quite an ""odd couple"" are different and idiosyncratic enough to create a nice contrast set against the big city.  Burns plays Jack Stanton, a small-time detective hired by Abe, a Peekskill softball coach whose wife has run out on him.  Jack is a misanthrope who doesn't eat in restaurants and as we discover, is still profoundly affected by the death of his wife.  Abe is slightly goofy, but kind-hearted, avoiding coffee and ""international foods"" of all kinds (except Italian.)  The picture is rounded out by a supporting cast of characters that underscore themes of loneliness and isolation.  Without every going too dark or depressing, Looking for Kitty is bittersweet and ultimately hopeful, and a film worth returning to time and again.

As with all of Burns' own pictures, the commentary track is great, insightful and lively, and demonstrates why his films are as good as they are -- he's interesting and he's full of interesting ideas.  Can't say I agree with all of them, however.  Both in the film and on the commentary track he knocks Star Wars, its adult fans and the films' importance in cinema history, and while I concur that neither the works of Fellini nor Truffaut deserved to be lessened in value, it's really only natural that later films would come along to supplant them to some degree -- and Star Wars is probably one of the most worthy candidates to do that.  It's just a generational thing.  In another 25 years, it will be something else.  Lucas also works outside the Hollywood system that Burns understandably detests, and Star Wars was the catalyst for a lot of positive and important changes in moviemaking.  That it also triggered Hollywood's greed for bigger and more successful blockbusters isn't the films' fault (nor was it a new idea to Hollywood circa 1977.)  But it did capture the imagination of a generation and it did usher in a new era of modern myth in film and literature.  Looking for Kitty is ultimately about learning to let go, but one thing that adults should never let go of is the love of good stories.  And there are many different kinds of stories, from the personal and heartfelt such as this film, to the larger-than-life epics like Star Wars, and each has its value and place.",1170288000,8,2879,4.697211155378486
2624967,4,B000H0M4BG,"I liked this movie enough to then listen to the commentary section, and I am very glad I did. I think Burns did a great job narrating the commentary and made it something that every budding movie-maker, and those interested in movie-making, must hear. He talks about the details of putting together a very low budget film, shot digitally and without permits, not much lighting, utilizing friends, asking for favors, etc. I enjoyed this aspect of the movie more than the movie itself, which is still quite good.",1164499200,7,510,4.806818181818182
2624968,5,B000H0M4BG,"""Looking for Kitty"" did not receive a wide release in theaters, but the movie arguably has more substance than, say, 80% of the material regular moviegoers are exposed to (in America anyway).  The predictable, scattered grumbles of ""Oh, it's a typical Ed Burns movie--yawn"" could be countered with a freewill argument: avoid the theater, rental, or online store if you know--and don't like--the man's artistic fingerprint.

To this reviewer's way of thinking, Burns' unique gifts that many folks began to appreciate with his 1995 debut, ""The Brothers McMullen,"" are still on display--and have naturally matured.  Some of the music in ""Looking for Kitty"" reminded me of that debut, and the writer/director/actor's charm is still there.  Plus, there is something nearly noble these days about a comedy that actually contains serious, reflective themes as well.  With this movie, you may well chuckle, laugh out loud--and even be reminded of the pleasures, suffering, and mysteries of life.  The characters are believable and recognizable--and the story is a bittersweet one.

For a fellow not quite 40, Mr. Burns has given us some highlights in the last decade or so--and ""Looking for Kitty"" may turn out to be one of the darkhorses.",1161907200,3,1231,5.186868686868687
2624969,4,B000H0M4BG,"Ed Burns' LOOKING FOR KITTY, which was shot before his THE GROOMSEN, was actually released after, briefly, to the theatres this year.  If you only have the money or inclination to check out one new Ed Burns film, I'd go for THE GROOMSMEN, which was a real audience pleaser (I saw it twice and both times the audience really responded) and deserved more attention than it received.  KITTY is minor, but shouldn't be completely overlooked, either.

Burns may never make a masterpiece, but I find his films since NO LOOKING BACK honest explorations of working-class people in New York, who aren't always treated any more three-dimensionally in film than any other groups (I actually find his two most successful films, McMULLEN and SHE'S THE ONE, his weakest!).  He attracts good casts and gets good performances out of them.

KITTYis a bit more of a ""chamber piece"" than the ensemble-based GROOMSMEN; shot on digital video, focusing largely on two guys, and running roughly 80 minutes, KITTY is a quiet character study, and not wholly succesful at that -- Burns  as an actor, writer and director generally ""underplays"" -- there are many times in his two recent films that you feel he's on the verge of something really special, but never quite gets over the edge.  But if you like New York cinema, Ed Burns, David Krumholz, or dramatic comedy charactery-type films, you certainly could give this a view, and won't regret it.",1161561600,7,1422,4.875518672199171
8135567,5,B000H0M4BG,"A buddy man's movie with a new york back drop. I appreciate movies that show the true ambiance of a town or city on location. You don't get more flavor than the big apple and Ed really uses that as a character in his indy flick. The busy restaurants, old buildings, the traffic, it's all captured down and dirty. No car chases or action fights of course which I don't always want anyway. Ed's Irish humor works well and really enjoyed the movie's message about new friendships and laughter. With low budgets, Ed Burns finds ways to make his movies human with the dialogue between characters. Two guys chatting about girls, food and coffee? I'll take it over Avengers most of the time. The commentary is awesome too, Ed gives an insightfull track on the process and scenes filmed noting they shot the movie in 10 days. He should get an award for that alone.",1453680000,,856,4.529032258064516

8135571,5,B000H0M4BG,"A lovely, well-written, and understated film by Edward Burns. I hate to fall into the cliche of ""there are two types of people in the world..."" but (you knew it was coming) people either seem to love or hate Edward Burns films. Personally, I love everything he's written and directed. He has a keen ear for dialogue that is familiar and fresh at the same time. This particular film is centered on the question ""What does it mean to lose someone?"" Burns explores this question in a way that deftly skirts melancholy but without becoming trite. ""Looking for Kitty"" may be best enjoyed if you're already familiar with and enjoy Burns' film world and quirky, but realistic, characters (for newbies, I'd recommend ""A Fitzgerald Family Christmas"" or ""She's the One"" to start with and then come back to ""Looking for Kitty""). Or, hey, jump in feet first and see if you get hooked.",1384905600,,872,4.705882352941177

8135573,2,B000H0M4BG,"I don't know why this is called a ""comedy"" on the box, nor do I see the Woody Allen aspect of this film. Bittersweet is a very apt description for this slow paced movie.

Abe goes to the big city to find his wife Kitty. He hires a detective, Jack to find her. During the movie we find out that she dumped Abe because his life was as boring as this film. Kitty is living with a rock star. During the course of the week Abe and Jack become friends and come to terms with their life in its current state (yawn). Nothing to see here folks.

The guy who printed ""comedy"" on the cover owes me $2.00. The acting was even good at times, but didn't compensate for a very dull script.",1341792000,,674,4.06015037593985

8135575,5,B000H0M4BG,"i puchased this movie because i love the panasonic dvx100b camcorder and this film was shot with that camera, i am a digital filmmaker myself meaning that i only shoot on digital and i make a bunch of digital film projects and this film proves that digital moviemaking can be just as beautiful and cinematic as 16mm or 35mm film when watching this movie i couldn't even tell that it was shot on compressed digital video,the color was more then perfect not a single bit of dar video grain through out the entire film director ed burns has such a unique way of directing and the camcera composition for this film was great, also he shot it the traditional way of making films, which made it look more theatrical and in his director commentaries he tells digital filmmakers all his secrets to making this motion picture for so cheap this movie inspried so many filmmakers its not jusr a movie but with the commentary included its like a filmmaking course all together",1201737600,,964,4.6104651162790695

It will make you laugh and there are some parts that will just tear at your heart strings (Ed Burns tearful scene is just heartbreaking). I have all Ed Burns movies for I was born and raised in NY and now live in Georgia. Burns' movies portray the REAL NYC, which allows me to relive my life as a New Yorker. Each movie always has me laughing and crying.....just as I was when living in NY.  GREAT MOVIE.....you will adore the story and of course, Ed Burns.",1178582400,,624,4.333333333333333
