8585333,5,B00CRNY6XK,Joey and Basil are a match made in freak heaven!  I couldn't recommend this amazing peek behind the red curtain any more.  The only experience better than this Docufantasy would be a front row seat to this amazing spectacle!!!,1396483200,,226,4.769230769230769
8585334,5,B00CRNY6XK,"A few years back I saw Arias With A Twist in NYC. This documentary includes some great scenes from the show, but the real treat is the background info. Learning about Basil and Joey's individual backgrounds and their creative relationship that gave birth to this delightful show was fascinating! I found it not only fun to watch but inspiring! I will watch it again !",1395014400,,367,4.661538461538462
8585335,4,B00CRNY6XK,"I loved seeing Arias With a Twist live in Washington DC last year, being a huge Basil Twist fan, but Joey Arias was new to me.  He was quite remarkable in theater! -- but this video gave me a greater appreciation of Joey in a fuller context.  I really enjoyed watching this and sharing with friends, but it was a bit overlong and a little disjointed in covering both artists.  Better editing would have made this 5 stars, but I recommend it highly all the same to fans of the very creative, audacious, and talented Joey Arias.

Yes, and Basil Twist's puppetry is so fabulous, it deserves a video of it's own.",1393977600,,608,4.401785714285714
8585336,5,B00CRNY6XK,"If you are into New York Night life Royalty, this is a must have. Anyone who knows of Joey Arias or Basil Twist will thoroughly enjoy this.",1389484800,,139,4.185185185185185
8585337,4,B00CRNY6XK,"The title is accurate in that it is Joey Arias, the performance artist, cabaret singer, and drag artist, front and center, with Basil Twist, the genius puppeteer, in a supporting role.

This must be an on-demand DVD because it came on a DVD-recordable disc.  Not a problem, really.

There is no chapter menu--in fact, the video is all in one chapter, so you can't jump ahead to different parts.

Variety writes that ""The collaboration between performance artist Joey Arias and master puppeteer Basil Twist forms the central portion of Bobby Sheehan's uplifting, enormously fun ""Arias With a Twist: The Docufantasy"" -- fantasy because anything Arias and Twist do, whether together or apart, involves flights of the imagination, and docu because talking heads, archival footage and sequences from the duo's stage spectacle ""Arias With a Twist"" provide commentary on the two careers. Notwithstanding some repetition and heartfelt hyperbole, this celebration of creativity should easily delight auds at gay events and well beyond, including fests, arthouses and satcasts.""

The accolades from Arias' friends become tiresome after a while, but it's still a fascinating look into these men's lives.

Working Pictures production. 2010.  Running time 80 minutes.",1381536000,2,1254,5.43298969072165
