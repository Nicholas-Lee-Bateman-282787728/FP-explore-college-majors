8540593,5,B0010WDJV4,"Buster Keaton always stated he had no philosophy, other than to be funny. He had an inherit sensitive side, having grown up in vaudeville, and forged close life-long freindships with many people of the world, regardless of class, race, or gender.
Matter-of-fact as Buster was, he not only possessed a true sense of his media as a comedian, actor, film-maker, stunt man and general entertainer, but was lucky enough to have a sense of human-ness. Not necessarily 'humanity,' as Buster may not have been so presumptuous, but a sense of people as their basic human selves. The incidental beauty and honesty of this film lives beyond its time, as does Buster Keaton himself.",1261785600,,670,4.938053097345133
