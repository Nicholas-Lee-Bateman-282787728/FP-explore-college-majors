1858860,5,B00008R9MC,"""The Jeffersons"" is the *BEST* show that was ever made. Sherman Hemsley (George Jefferson) and Marla Gibbs (Florence Johnston) is what made ""The Jeffersons"" such a hit in my opinion. Sherman Hemsley and Marla Gibbs are so funny. Marla Gibbs is fantastic as The Jeffersons wise cracking maid. Florence and George can't stand each other, which is one reason why they are so funny. The rest of the cast is also terrific. I can't wait untill The Complete Second Season comes out on DVD. I hope that all seasons of ""The Jeffersons"" come out on DVD. George Jefferson is my idol.
Memorable Line From Season Two:
Florence is talking to George: ""Ask me how I got to work this morning.""
George: ""I know how you got to work. You flew over on your broom!""
To understand why the quote above is so funny you need to watch the show. In other words this show is a *CLASSIC* they don't make shows like this any more.",1049500800,6,899,4.454545454545454

1858920,4,B00008R9MC,"The Jeffersons second season was actually a full season with 24 episodes. The main difference is the new Lionel now played by Damon Evans (no relation to Mike Evans who left the series to work on ""Good Times""). In the first episode, the Jeffersons throw an unforgettable birthday party for their neighbor, Mr. Bentley. There are plenty of memorable scenes and guest appearances with the likes of Lou Gossett Jr., Robert Guillaume, Ernest Thomas, Melinda Dillon, and more.

Mother Jefferson has a new boyfriend, Jenny's Uncle Bertram. Zara Cully was a scene stealer in her role of Mother Olivia Jefferson. Then there is the episode entitled ""Florence's Problem"" where the Jeffersons and Willises intervene to save Florence. It's a beautifully done episode and with a few laughs too. Marla Gibbs proved herself in that episode alone of her talented acting skills. There are other memorable episodes like Jenny's grandfathers try to bond over similarities than differences; George gets trapped in his bathroom with the Willises; and Mother Jefferson's birthday.

The second season has three discs in it and a guide description of the episodes with cast and company credits. I always enjoyed The Jeffersons and still do to this day. The writing is crisp, witty, and smart. The interaction is realistic and believable. It's nice to see how an ensemble of wonderful actors and actresses worked well together.

I only wished the DVD featured extra features about the series like an interview with Norman Lear or the cast members. This series ran for about a decade until the network canceled it without a proper finale episode. Still, it's one of the best series ever with the greatest cast ever and led by genius Norman Lear.",1438473600,2,1719,5.024561403508772

1858932,5,B00008R9MC,"The Jeffersons was one of my favorite sitcoms back in the 70's, and still is today. Back then there was a lot more leeway for writers. The N word was used in comedies like The Jeffersons and Sanford & Son. Everyone knew that Sherman Hemsley (George Jefferson), or Carol O'Conner (Archie Bunker, of All In The Family), were not bigots in real life, it was just a part they were playing in a sitcom. George had Weezy and Lionel, to try to talk some sense into him, and Archie had Edith, Mike (Meathead), and Gloria as the rational people in his family. In the case of Sanford and Sons it was Lamont, Fred's son, who was always trying to get his father to be sensible. The combination of ignorance and levelheadedness played off of each other and the results were hilarious.",1433462400,,771,4.475177304964539

1858935,4,B00008R9MC,"This 1975-76 Season was where this comical series that ran on CBS from 1975-85 hit it stride regarding an affluent African American couple living in the Big Apple launching the 2nd spinoff series of ALL IN THE FAMILY, on which George Jefferson(Sherman Hemsley)and his wife Wheezy Jefferson(Isabel Sanford)had been the neighbors of Archie & Edith Bunker(Carol O'Connor, Jean Stapleton).

The producers of THE JEFFERSONS also came up with MARRIED WITH CHILDREN in the Spring of 1987, which was also the Fox networks very first TV show as well along with the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was a very big success and made Christina Applegate(Kelly Bundy)a a major superstar along with the fact that the Bundy's lasted for 10 years on Fox, from 1987-97.

Unfortunately, THE JEFFERSON'S was abruptly cancelled in the Summer of 1985 without sufficient warning and no 12th Season underway and no series finale episode to finish off its whole 10-year run on CBS either, but was shown in reruns throughout the years after its cancellation and is now on Antenna TV every weeknight and was on TV Land back in the early 200's.",1428537600,,1115,4.957219251336898

1858986,5,B00008R9MC,"The laughs continue non-stop in this second season of the classic sitcom. Joining the cast this season is Damon Evans, who replaced Mike Evans (no relation) in the role of Lionel Jefferson - a role Damon would portray over the next three seasons. During Season Two, George is invited to lecture a group of teenagers from his old neighborhood in Harlem in the episode ""George Won't Talk"", where George's delivery van is stolen. In the episode ""Movin' On Down"", George is facing financial difficulties, so as a result, he fears he & Louise may face the possibility of being poor again. A young woman shows up at the apartment claiming to be related to Louise in ""Louise's Daughter"", & Mother Jefferson, feeling ignored & left out by her family, feigns an injury in ""Mother Jefferson's Fall"". Like the first season, the writing & acting are both top-notch & professional, & the laughs occur at a mile a minute. There are guest appearances by Robert Guillaume & Louis Gossett, Jr. this season, with Gossett portraying a womanizer who has a thing for Louise in ""George's Best Friend"". With plenty of excellent episodes to choose from, you'll find there's a lot to offer in this DVD set of ""The Jeffersons - The Complete Second Season"". Don't let the laughs pass you by - get it today!

1859072,4,B00008R9MC,"I should have guessed when I read the back cover, that has 9 episodes per disc - apart from disc 3, which contains 6 episodes and promos I wouldn't care for one way or the other.

The insert lists all the titles, but they aren't differentiated by disc number.  I own a number of Columbia titles, and this is the first time they skimped on the index insert.

The source material is very good looking.  DVD compression is typical for Columbia releases (aka ""fair"").

The DVD audio on discs 1 and 2 is a vast improvement from the ""remastering"" done for their season 1 discs.  Unfortunately, the audio for many of disc 3's episodes is muted and hard to listen too; too much audio being removed along with the background hiss during the cleanup process.  Hopefully they'll fix the problem for free one day...  Comparing overzealous 'cleaning' to leaving the original hiss present (see ""All in the Family"" season 5 DVD set), I'd prefer the hiss if I had to choose any imperfections (and for the money, I'd prefer a properly made release.)

And, as usual, no extras worth having either.  They hype up that these shows made TV history, and yet they don't have any commentaries or extras that help tell us WHY it made history.  (long time fans know, but I may as well tell you King William is a great guy but not bother to say WHY...  there are numerous King Williams in history too...)

It's like Columbia doesn't care about its customers at times; but all and all there's not as much to complain about this time...

Regardless, core fans will love this show regardless and may as well spend the money.  Like breadcrumbs to slaves, we're lucky to get the show released at all.  So here are the best episodes:

""Louise's Daughter"" ***** - A lady claiming to be Louise's daughter appears.

""Mother Jefferson's Fall"" **** - Mother Jefferson feigns a fall to get attention; feeling she is being ignored.

""Uncle Bertram"" ***** - Jenny's uncle, Bertram, makes passes at Mother Jefferson.  (there are some great moments in this...)

""George Won't Talk"" ***** - George refuses to go to Harlem to speak about being a successful black man, thinking he'll get ripped off.  He reluctantly goes... and gets ripped off.

""George's Best Friend"" ***** - George's best friend from the navy pays a visit... but becomes more interested in Louise.

""Jenny's Grandparents"" ***** - Tired of the bickering between her grandfathers, Jenny seeks the help of Mother Jefferson and Uncle Bertram.  (another GREAT entry!)

""George's Alibi"" **** - During a severe blizzard, Lionel wrecks George's truck by accident.  Meanwhile, a news report reveals somebody was hit in an accident, with George's truck being identified.  George thinks he caused the incident.

""George and the Manager"" ***** - George is under attack for not wanting to hire a female manager.  (Another TERRIFIC entry; his defense for not hiring whites is utterly noble and correct.)

""George Vs Wall Street"" ***** - George invests in beans, hoping natural disaster will allow him to profit from it.  (Another GREAT entry; the moral talk of profiting from peoples' suffering I don't think had ever been addressed before - or since - in tv history.)

""The Break-up"", part 1 ***** - Lionel is desperate to pass a college course, and George buys a readymade term paper.  A HUGE argument ensues, causing Jenny and Lionel to break up... and the Jeffersons and Willises break up as well.  AWESOME set-up that couldn't be better handled (and the cast handle some difficult scenes with aplomb, this stuff is incredibly good!)  Indeed, George's response to the question ""What would happen if everybody bought papers"" is a classic.

""The Break-up"" (conclusion) *** - George wants to help Lionel find a new girlfriend... and brings on up somebody he didn't fathom:  A call girl!  (there are some fun moments, but you know they'll all get back together by the end...)

""Florence's Problem"" ***** - Louise notices peculiar behavior in Florence and suspects she has plans to kill herself.

""Tennis, Anyone?"" ***** - George is invited to become a member in an excusive tennis club.  But he shortly finds out WHY he was chosen...

As for the show itself, the sharp wit, sarcasm, and flirting with social issues remains - though the educational slant is somewhat reduced...  But there's a confidence in this season not felt in season 1.  Even with the ""new Lionel"", who takes some time getting used to.  And especially for the episodes I'd listed above, the character and plot twists are definitely atypical; even if the plots themselves are (e.g. ""Louise's Daughter"" with the storyline that she may have cheated while George was serving in Korea.)

All in all, season 2 is a wild success.  The best part of which is that Florence (Marla Gibbs) breaks out of her season 1 stereotype and comes into her own - with style and pizzazz.  She and George are riotous together, with their sparring and her sarcastic wit.

Definitely worth getting, but the lack of care put into this set has me skeptical for seasons 3 and 4, which I shall netflix first and then buy if there's more effort put into them.",1140048000,14,5107,4.780571428571428

1859076,5,B00008R9MC,"Nominated for 13 Emmys and 8 Golden Globes, The Jeffersons was a groundbreaking situation comedy that was not only utterly hilarious, but also explored the controversial social issues of its day. Premiering in mid-season 1975, the show was a spin-off of the #1 hit series All In The Family, where main characters George and Louise were the next-door neighbors of Archie and Edith Bunker. During its nine-season run, The Jeffersons spent all but its last season as a Top 25 Nielsen rated show. One of the first sitcoms to center exclusively around the lives of African-Americans, The Jeffersons most likely featured television's first interracial married couple in Tom and Helen Willis. It was this fearless attempt to push the boundaries of the status quo that made the show one of the funniest of its time as well as a valuable resource for American race relations...

The Jeffersons follows the lives of George (Sherman Hemsley) and Louise Jefferson (Isabel Sanford), a middle-aged African-American couple who own a string of successful dry cleaning stores. The windfall generated by their business paves the way for George and Louise to ""move on up"" into an exclusive Park Avenue apartment. The series is made by Hemsley's portrayal of the stubborn and greedy, yet quite lovable, character of George whose sarcasm and antics are only equaled by the Jeffersons' quick witted live-in maid Florence (Marla Gibbs). A supporting cast composed of omni-present neighbors Tom (Franklin Cover) and Helen Willis (Roxie Roker), the ever-polite Bentley (Paul Benedict), and a tip-grubbing doorman named Ralph (Ned Wertimer) provide for endless sources of irritation and annoyance for George. Throw in George's mother (Zara Cully) and her constant insults of Louise, and The Jeffersons becomes one of the best-written humorous shows of its time...

The Jeffersons (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""A Dinner for Harry"" in which the Jeffersons plan a birthday party for their neighbor Harry Bentley, but the party turns sour when Tom Willis shows up wearing the same jacket as George. Meanwhile, Helen tries to conceal from Tom that she was mugged because he's already considering leaving New York... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Mother Jefferson's Fall"" in which, in a play for attention, George's mother proves to be an even greater burden on Louise than normal, and ""George's Best Friend"" in which George's old Navy pal Wendell (Louis Gossett, Jr.) pays a visit only to end up incessantly hitting on Louise...

Below is a list of episodes included on The Jeffersons (Season 2) DVD:

1859077,5,B00008R9MC,"This series just got better and better with each season!!! It's no surprize it lasted so long. The actor's were perfectly cast and the writing was brilliant!!! Need I say Norman Lear was a sheer genius at creating outstanding sitcoms, that featured older actors as it's lead characters. The episodes from this season leave you eagerly wanting more! The packaging was perfect and the quality of the discs were crisp and clear. True Jefferson's fans will not be disappointed! I JUST WISH COLUMBIA TRISTAR WOULD GET BUSY AND START RELEASING SEASONS THREE THROUGH TEN PRONTO!!! There are many more outstanding episodes in season three and others, like when george and louise seek marital advise from Tom and Helen, the trials and tribulations of Jenny and Lionel, and let's not forget the special guest appearance of Billy Dee Williams!!! These episodes are priceless!!! It's would also be nice to see the surviving cast be interviewed and pay special tribute to the late Isabel Sanford. WHAT A GREAT LADY!!! It's hard to believe she was almost 20 years older than Sherman Hemsley when they played husband and wife!!! GEORGE AND WEEZIE FOREVER!!!! AGAIN RELEASE SEASON THREE PRONTO COLUMBIA TRISTAR!!!",1106697600,2,1197,5.081218274111675
1859078,5,B00008R9MC,The Jeffersons is a comedy classic! But please we want more ...when is more releasing. I can'y wait...why not sell a complete box set....why the delay?... please. The Jeffersons is a comedy that one can watch over and over again.,1095724800,2,229,4.75
1859079,5,B00008R9MC,"For a show that ran for more than a decade this is just about my favorite season.  It's basically a toss up between the first three season.  Rarely have I laughed as hard as when I watched ""George meets Whittendale"".  When Tom said he had to use the bathroom I almost used it myself.  ""Lunch with Mama"" had me rolling in laughter as well.  ""The Break Up (parts 1 & 2) is a favorite of mine as well.  Some people complained about the change in actors for Lionel Jefferson.  I like the way Mike Evans portrayed the character but also thought Damon Evans (No relation to Mike Evans) did a great job.  In some ways I like Damon's portrayal better.  This show was never the same after Mama Jefferson died.

The DVD package was still underdeveloped.  No extras at all.  There are still enough of the original cast around to make a good documentary.  One improvement over the first season release of THE JEFFERSONS is the option to play the episodes back to back.  It is so much nicer when you can just watch episode after episode without being returned to the main menu to select each episode.  I should also mention that the DVD producers must not be fans of the show.  The packaging, for both seasons 1 & 2, contain stock photos from various episodes over the shows eleven seasons.  In fact the front covers are all wrong.  They have photshoped the images of George and Louise together from different years of the show.  For example, the picture of Louise on the cover is taken from a photo that probably was taken 7 to 10 years after the 75-76 season.  The photo of George was probably taken within a year or two of the 75-76 season.  Anyway, this may not be a big concern, especially to the casual fan, but I find this kind of slaped together DVD packaging somewhat insulting to real fans of the show.",1094601600,,1799,4.407294832826747
1859110,5,B00008R9MC,"There's a new Lionel and even more laughs and episodes with the hilarious second season of the Jeffersons!  This is where the Jeffersons began to literally ""move on up"" both in writing and character development.  In the second season, we not only get to know George & Weezie a lot better, but also the Willis', not to mention Mother Jefferson gets craftier, Bentley gets weirder, Florence gets sassier, and Ralph just gets more shameless!  Another big change is Damon Evans replacing Mike Evans as Lionel Jefferson.  Damon brings something new to the role and makes it his own from the get go.  He would play Lionel until 1978 after which Mike reclaimed the role.  Memorable moments abound in this DVD set like when George & Tom wear the same dinner jacket, Weezy's daughter visits, Mother Jefferson fakes a nasty fall, Louis Gosset puts the moves on Weezy, Lionel dents the company van, George locked in the bathroom with the Willis', Lionel & Jenny break up, Florence might jump off the empire state building, Lionel gets drunk, Bentley goes out on a date, George dances on the bed, and much much more!

Don't be a weird dude or a jive turkey...get the Jeffersons Season 2 right now!  Can't wait for season 3!  By the way, this DVD set has the play all episodes feature and you can skip past the opening theme...as if anyone would want to do that!  3 DVDs and 24 episodes for the same price as season 1!
Also recommended:
Good Times season one (which Mike Evans co-created and named the family after his!)
Sanford & Son seasons 1, 2, & 3 (coming in October 2003!)
All in the Family Seasons 1 & 2
and of course the Jeffersons Season 1...duh!

1859111,5,B00008R9MC,"First of all, this season is better than the first. And for 1 buck an episode is a pretty good price. This season is probably one of the best. it has great sound and video quality, If you buy this I don't think you will be dissapointed.",1060041600,2,236,4.042553191489362
1859112,5,B00008R9MC,"Along with I love Lucy, Strangers with Candy, Buffy, The Golden Girls and Charlie's Angels, I think the Jeffersons is also counted in on my top 10 favorite TV SHOWS. How funny are these people? Seriously, hours and hours of fun on 3 discs for just ...? Yes, for $... with your suncoast replay card, you can have all 24 episodes on this great box set. Definitely worth the money, and every episode is very good. Although Strangers with Candy has always basically been my favorite show ever (along with the Golden Girls), this 70'S SITCOM IS also close to me and I really like it.

1859113,5,B00008R9MC,"Here are the episodes that aired between fall 1975 and spring 1976 on CBS. One that I loved was the two-part ""The Break-Up"",which is between the Jeffersons' son Lionel and Jenny,Tom and Helen Willis' daughter. ... The beauty of it is,Lionel and Jenny reconcile in part two. Also in that episode,the friendship between the Jeffersons and the Willises dissolves with their respective childrens' relationship. When Lionel and Jenny reconcile,the Jeffersons and the Willises become friends again. George does continue to refer to Tom,English neighbor Harry Bentley,landlord Mr. Whittendale(sorry,don't know his first name) and doorman Ralph Hart,occasionally seen as honkies. I think this is the season where Marla Gibbs joins the Jeffersons cast as Florence Johnston,the Jeffersons' maid. Also,Damon Evans resumes the role of Lionel,originally played by Mike Evans,who at this time served as a producer for Good Times which he had co-created. As for the Jeffersons' former residence,now occupied by Archie Bunker's daughter,Gloria Bunker Stivic and husband Mike, at this time they have become proud parents. The Jeffersons at this time were in the Nielsen Top 10.",1055116800,11,1160,5.559322033898305

1859116,4,B00008R9MC,"I have both season 1 & season 2 sets.  The show is great as everyone says, but the DVD is kinda lacking.  The good news is you get 24(as opposed to season one's 13) episodes from the second season(only seen a handful of episodes so far but Florence the Maid is more sassy like you remembered her, and there's a different Lionel, etc).  The bad news is, no extras whatsoever(dissapointing) and in mono/fullscreen(which is to be expected for a 70's show).  Bare bones DVD presentation, but if you really liked the show, that should be enough(again, 24 episodes!).  Highly recommended.",1053043200,2,582,4.78

1859118,5,B00008R9MC,"The JEFFERSONS, without a doubt, was the most hilariously FUNNY sitcom on television. It didn't matter if you tuned in weekly, occasionally or sporadically - you were consistently ENTERTAINED and walked away fully satisfied with every viewing. This show NEVER lost it's appeal nor its audience, and was also one of the most enduring(1975-85) TV sitcoms in television history. MARLA GIBBS as ""Florence"", without a doubt, has to be the all-time ULTIMATE maid in the sense that she totally took over and ran the household, stole the show each and everytime she appeared on camera, and basically had everyone around her being her servants. She was too funny and quite a memorable character no other actress could have played. Our beloved FLORENCE lives on - instilled in our memories forever! Sherman Hemsley is just as funny and has enjoyed a long running career since the Jeffersons, playing basically, ""GEORGE"" himself through other subsequent and successful sitcoms. It's always great to see both George and Louise(the lovely ISABEL SANFORD)appearing on commercials and cameos on various sitcoms through the years. The whole Jeffersons gang is here, Mother Jefferson; The Late Roxie Roker(""Helen"" and rocker Lenny Kravitz' real life Mom); Lionel & Jenny; Tom; etc. The gospel style tinged theme song, ""MOVIN' ON UP"" written and performed here by none other than the multi-talented JA'NET DUBOIS(she played sassy neighbor ""WILLONA"" on ""Good Times"")is also featured in every opening sequence. ISABEL SANFORD once said that CBS cancelled the show without even giving the JEFFERSONS a ""Goodbye"" final episode, so making it available on Dvd collector's sets to fans kinda makes up for that.
