7276318,5,B00ZE1JYRU,"Highly underrated detective series.  The Established networks don't really like these series for some reason.  I guess too conservative. Tom Selleck had to shell out his own cash to make some of them.

""The character of Jesse Stone, a deeply troubled man, was a departure for the author. Parker, comparing Stone to Spenser, the protagonist of his first series and the one for which he was best known, said, ""Jesse is a much more damaged individual who is coming to terms with himself as he goes along."" - Robert Parker

7276324,4,B00ZE1JYRU,"Jesse Stone Collection Volume 1 (0663 - DVD collection - November 29, 2015)

""The truth is out there just let it in"".

Summary:
These four ""make for television"" movies feature Tom Selleck as police chief Jesse Stone. The films are based upon novels written by Robert B. Parker (1932-2010). There are a multitude of plot descriptions and opinions about these films here on Amazon so I was not add mine. My comments are about the Volume 1 collection itself. I will say that I like the character Jesse Stone and his stories very much.

This DVD collection sold under the name Jesse Stone Collection Volume 1""  consist of 4 film:
 Stone Cold
 Death in Paradise
 Thin Ice
 No Remorse

Content & Packaging:
The packaging is your standard DVD hard plastic snap box. There are two DVD disk with two movies on each disk. There are no ""extras"" such as interviews or ""making of"" videos. Most importantly there are no deleted scenes. The lack of extras are very disappointing to this viewer and admirer of the Jesse Stone movies. I believe they would have added a great deal to my enjoyment of these shows.

Positive Comments:
 The quality of the video on these four movies was excellent - no jitter or glitches.
 For the price for this 4 movies set you can't complain and that comment applied to Volume 2 also.

Negative Comments:
 My major complaint concerning Volume 1 was that the film ""Night Passages"" was not included. Without ""Night Passage"" new viewers - like this commentator - missed out on Jesse's cross country trip from LA and how he got the job as police chief in Paradise from that comical sleaze Hasty Hathaway.

. Recommendation:
  Buy Vol. 1 and 2 and watch ""Night Passages"" first - wish I had. I knocked the rating down to four stars because of the out of sequence films.",1450051200,12,1778,4.611464968152866

That said, it came with ultraviolet copies for all of the films in the set which is a great deal. They go for $10 each digital and $8-$10 each as individual DVD releases. The digital code expires December 2017 for those buying in the future.

The films themselves are fantastic. The cast is on their A game and there is something very compelling about the stories. They aren't super action packed which makes the action that does occur that much more exciting. These are solid movies and great adaptations of the books!",1497830400,,612,4.513513513513513

7276396,5,B00ZE1JYRU,"I LOVE these Jesse Stone movies. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. Absolutely beautiful scenery. I have even paused the DVD to marvel at how gorgeous the photography is. Second, the music is exquisitely melancholy. It draws you right into the mood. It's like a soothing sound bath. I just ordered the CD set prepared by Jeff Beal. https://www.amazon.com/Jesse-Stone-Ultimate-Collection-Jeff/dp/B01A74E39W. If you are a classical music fan, this soundtrack reminds me of Eric Satie's Gnossienne No. 1.  Beautiful!  I haven't read Robert Palmer's books but if they are half as good as these movies I'd like to. It's not really the detective stories but the superb character development that are so compelling. Tom Selleck is GREAT. I've been a fan of his since the Magnum TV series. This character is the opposite of that one! He plays a divorced, mildly depressed alcoholic Chief of Police in the small town of Paradise. The supporting cast is good as well. William Devane is his ex-cop Shrink. Kohl Sudduth and Kathy Baker are co-workers in the 3 person police department. The interaction and camaraderie between the three is really believable.
Saul Rubinek plays an auto salesman and formerly corrupt town council president. A convincing sleezeball.  All of the actors are good. The stories are interesting.  I hope they make more.

Be aware that this particular compilation is out of order. Probably a STUPID marketing ploy since the transfer quality is very good.
You need to buy Volume 1 and 2 and also ""Lost in Paradise"", the 9th movie, that is not included in this collection. If you have a DVD player that allows you to put all 4 discs in and switch back and forth between them then this isn't a big deal for you. For me it is.  I was all prepared for a Jessie marathon over Memorial Day weekend and started with Disc 1 of Volume 1 only to find I missed the beginning which is in the Vol 2. So, today I looked up the correct sequence that follows the books as well as TV airings. Here is it.
1. Stone Cold ( 2005)
2. Jesse Stone: Night Passage ( 2006)
3. Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise ( 2006)
4. Jesse Stone: Sea Change ( 2007)
5. Jesse Stone: Thin Ice ( 2009)
6. Jesse Stone: No Remorse ( 2010)
7. Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost ( 2011)
8. Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt (2012)
