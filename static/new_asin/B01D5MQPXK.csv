8755073,5,B01D5MQPXK,What even is this show? Is it about bears? Is it about lesbians? I haven't even seen a storm yet?! Who cares. Its fantastic. Yes its weird but thats why we love anime so much in the first place. Once you get into it theres some very deep insight on how homosexuality is treated in japan and its just a good and sometimes hard to understand show.,1508889600,,345,4.164179104477612
8755074,5,B01D5MQPXK,"Another masterpiece from Kunihiko Ikuhara. If you like Revolutionary Girl Utena, Penguin Drum or Sailor Moon you'll like this too.",1488931200,,130,5.55
8755075,5,B01D5MQPXK,"Relies heavily on symbolism and the theme is dealing with homophobia/mob mentality. For 3/4ths of the show you may be thinking what the hell is going on which isn't always a bad thing, by the end all the dots will connect. Definitly not for everyone, In the beginning it seems silly/easygoing but it has much darker undertones you will see as the story progresses. Artwork is good although one minor complaint is the characters faces from the side looked funny, soundtrack is really good, and the way the story is presented is very unique.

If you enjoyed Princess Utena or the amazing Mawaru Penguindrum then I have no doubt you will enjoy this",1472428800,3,645,4.707964601769912
8755076,5,B01D5MQPXK,"Fantastic anime, but not for everyone. It is a yuri (girl love) show that addresses homophobia, repression, and the problems within yuri's problematic portrayal of lesbians. However, much like the director's, Kunihiko Ikuhara, other works (including Utena; Sailor Moon R, S, & SuperS; and Penguindrum), the series is heavily stylized with symbolism, metaphysics, and metanarratives. I wasn't sure how I felt about the series during the first 3 episodes; however, by the time you finish episode 4, you should have a good grasp on the plot and whether you like it or not. I love this show, but if you don't, I can totally understand. If this interests you at all, give it a watch and try to make it through episode 4 before judging it. That seems to be the turning point for most people who have watched it, including myself.",1469750400,4,823,4.802816901408451
