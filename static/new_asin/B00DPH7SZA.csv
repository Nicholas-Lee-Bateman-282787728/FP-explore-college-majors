5841385,5,B00DPH7SZA,"Always did love this series, back when it was Battle of the Planets.  When I became older and an anime fan, I wanted to get a copy of Gatchaman, but for the longest time it was impossible to find.  Recently, it came out on DVD, and I purchased the whole set, only to misplace them after watching them twice, shortly after they went out of production, so I was thrilled to learn that a Blu-Ray edition was planned.

The series is a contemporary of Robotech and Yamato, and presents the story of five heroic teenagers in their battle to defend the earth from an invading alien and his army of criminals and genetic mutants.  Lots of (cheesy) giant mechs, some surprisingly gut-wrenching scenes and one of the most memorable endings ever.  I never could watch the sequel series, for fear of it reducing the heavy impact of the end of this story.

Recommend this series to fans of older anime, also those who watched Battle of the Planets (or G-Force) and thought they knew it, but have never seen this... you'll be surprised at what you missed the first time.  Also recommend it to fans of newer anime; this is where the five-hero pattern of anime came from, and whether you're a fan of Power Rangers or Sailor Moon or Megas XLR, you're watching the descendants of this show.",1388275200,9,1272,4.528384279475983
5841386,5,B00DPH7SZA,"I remember watching Battle of the Planets when I was a child and understood much later that the show was edited which included ridiculous scenes of a robot who was never originally there to begin with. So brings the reality of Gatchaman! Having bought some bootleg DVD sets in the past, this OFFICIAL BLU-RAY release is the ONLY way to go! I usually consider myself a purist and prefer to watch the show in its original Japanese language with the English subtitles, but the newly created English language track is fantastic and the voices appropriately match the characters spot on (not the English dub crap that was in Battle of the Planets).

Both Japanese and English tracks are included here with optional English subtitles. For sound quality, the Japanese track seems to sound weak and loses depth, whereas the English track sounds full and rich. For this reason, I watch Gatchaman in English.

The video quality is superb! Many of the scenes look as if it was produced yesterday. This is the best we're going to see it.

As for the extras, I haven't looked into this yet, but read many reviews on it which gives me a good idea what to expect.

THIS SHOW IS ADDICTING! I can't seem to stop watching it!",1387497600,38,1207,4.626168224299065
5841387,5,B00DPH7SZA,"This is an amazing box set. The packaging is similar to the DVD sets released a few years ago, adorned in beautiful art by comic book artist/painter, Alex Ross. The box is pretty sturdy cardboard, but I thought it would have been a little sturdier, honestly. Still, it's not bad. Each of the three cases contains several discs with the flippers in the middle containing discs and discs are also held in the case itself. Each disc also has artwork from Alex, many of which feature characters from the series, and the vehicles. It's beautifully done.

The menus are not animated, but are clear and easy to navigate. One problem I seem to be having is selecting the original Japanese audio option with English subtitles from the menu. I'll experiment with that more. The episodes themselves are incredible. I'm amazed at how clean the series looks on Blu-ray. It exceeded all expectations. I own the Battle of the Planets Rhino DVDs that included bonus episodes of Gatchaman and the difference was astounding. Even before I did the compare I knew the Blu-ray transfers were of the highest quality. Colors are solid, bright, and every detail of the gorgeous animation shines through as if you're looking at the cells themselves, with few blemishes. Remember, this show is now over forty years old and it does not look it. They really have done a great job of cleaning up the show for this transfer. I didn't own the DVDs from the other set so I can't compare this set with those, but I am amazed. I was concerned this might not get the high-quality transfer treatment and that they might just throw the DVD transfers onto Blu-ray, but that's not the case. I also found that I like the new English dub. The actors have done a good job.

In this set you get all 105 episodes and the OVA, plus, numerous bonus features. In fact, it appears that all of the bonus features from the DVDs are included here. Sentai Works, kudos on making an amazing set. I hope that some of my other favorite cartoons get the Blu-ray treatment because it they look incredible. I'll definitely double-dip to buy them again just for the high-quality.",1386979200,5,2120,4.650666666666667
5841388,5,B00DPH7SZA,"Who doesn't remember GForce when they were growing up.  I watched it every morning before school when I was a kid and I must say I'm having a blast watching it again.  The bluray looks pretty good for a show that came out thirty years ago.  The only complaint I might have is that they didn't stick with the original voice overs for the english language option.  I seem to remember it sounding a little different back then.  But all in all I think it was a good buy, I definitely got my moneys worth.  I would recommend this set for anyone who wants to relive the past and enjoyed this show as a kid.",1386720000,3,600,4.173913043478261
5841389,5,B00DPH7SZA,"Fantastic!  Where to start!  You probably already know that this is the series upon which Battle of the Planets was based, so perhaps you're curious about the original?  Series 1 (there were two others following) consists of 105 episodes.  Off hand, I'd say that there's not much to the first 45 episodes: The animation is early 70's TV-level (I don't mind it, but you might), and the stories are largely episodic.  You can tell as they approached the end of the first year with episode 52 of the weekly series, something started to click--you get the mystery of the Red Impulse, and some good serial storytelling and archs.  By the second half of the series, things get shift into high gear, and we really care about not just the five science ninjas, but their leader Dr. Nambu, the weirdly-tragic-batman-looking Berg Katse, and we even want to know about the enigmatic Leader X.  On top of that, by the second half of the series, most of the guest ""stars"" or characters are really interesting and conflicted on their own.  Episodes 98-105 will floor you--I know it's a cliche, but I wish go back and watch that arc for the first time!  Oh, and while it's probably not ideal, that's the arc I started with, back when all you could get were fan-dubbed VHS taped, and it hooked me then!

ADV was the first to dub these 105 episodes with an attempt to keep the original spirit of them there.  The actors give it a good go, and the performances are passable.  Too often for my tastes though, the voices get a little silly, or the acting isn't quite there.  I say that with the utmost respect and thanks though, because it's great to be able to watch these without concentrating on reading subtitles.  You can also play these with the original japanese language tracks.  I get the feeling that here in the US, a voice actor is somebody with some skill who wants to make some relatively easy money, but in Japan they are *ACTORS*.  It's great listening to the original Japanese, and while there are a few melodramatic or silly parts, to my ears it comes across as much more serious.

When ADV released these, they did so at two DVDS+one extras disc at a time.  It took forever to come out, you start with the clunkers, and I was worried they wouldn't sell well enough to make it to the good episodes.  This release is a much better deal, since you get all 105 episodes at once, PLUS the Original Video Animations (OVA) episodes from the early 2000's.  I have my criticisms of those OVAs, but they're great to have in the package, and the one thing they do do is make Galactor seem like a bad ****!!!  They're definitely worth the watch.

I haven't viewed the extras on this set, but I believe they're the same as ADV's (other than including the OVAs).  If so, there's commentary on several eps, but I found it a little disappointing.  Most often it's the actors, giving their basic thoughts on the episodes and life--not too much insight.  With as popular as this series is (was?), I wish they could have found a mega-fan to provide commentary on some of the key episodes.  Those of you who have heard the fan commentary to Transformers: The Movie know what I'm talking about.

Other than that, the packaging is solid and the discs are well-protected.

Hopefully this sells well enough that we'll see Gatchaman II and Gatchaman Fighter subbed/dubbed and released too!",1386547200,11,3362,4.576923076923077
5841390,4,B00DPH7SZA,"For some reason Best Buy shipped this to me sooner than the tenth of December.  So I will go ahead and review this.

First this is the unedited Gatchaman, known mostly in the United States as ""Battle of the Planets"" or ""G-Force: Guardians of Space"".

This unedited edition contains all 105 unedited dubbed episodes.  It has wonderful dub work and the voice actors seem to fit the characters rather well.  I have no complaints about the dubbing.  I can say it's a lot better voice work than ""Battle of the Planets"" which made Jinpei a babbling idiot.

What does unedited mean?  Simply put, it really is nothing more than what you saw on ""Battle of the Planets"" or ""G-force"", however, this unedited edition of the show does not sugar coat death.  Soldiers of the evil organization the team fights die, unlike the other shows passing them off as robots or the deaths are just softened.  Also the issue of Transgenderism is taken out of the show all together in both ""Battle of the Planets"" and ""G-force"".  In this edition they leave the whole story line in tact with one of the characters transgender nature.  One episode does have nudity, but it's very brief and for the most part forgettable (Its of a young girl showering, with just the backside shown).  Also in the unedited edition their is some cursing, but not enough to really worry about.  Over all, I would still call this kid friendly for a more mature child about the age of 13 on up.  I would give the show a PG-13 rating.

The show is listed as 16:9.  Which scared me at fist, but lucky all the episodes are in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  As one review posted the extra's are in 16:9, which I can not figure out why they would do so.  I have not gotten into the extra's as I have the original DVD box sets and seen all the extras already.

The picture is outstanding for what it is.  Its old 70ish cartooning, what more can you ask for?  Its crisp and sharp and a good update over the DVDs.  If you have not bought the DVD sets I would definitely pick this copy of the show up as its the best it has ever looked.  To me its not a significant upgrade over the DVD sets to upgrade to the blu-ray like I have done.  If you like the show and hope for ""Gatchaman II"" to be released than buying this set might help in that development process.  From what I know Disney owns ""Eagle Riders"" which was the American adaptation of ""Gatchaman II"" so who knows if it will ever be released in this unedited format.

Sound is English: DTS-HD Master Audio Mono.  It sounds good, but again not a significant upgrade over the DVDs.  You got the Japanese tracks as well with subtitles that are huge and fill up the screen.

Overall this is the best the show has ever looked, but in my opinion the upgrade is not worth it if you already own the DVD sets.  I bought this because I really like the show, and I wanted to watch it again with better picture and sound.  What I got is better picture and upgraded sound, but not a huge jump from the original DVDs.  If you do not own the DVDs and you want to get into the Science Ninja Teams escapades than this is the set for you.  I wouldn't bother with the DVDs if you own a Blu-Ray player as this is the better format for a newcomer.

Another thing note worthy of this release, it contains the OVA episodes remastered and dubbed just like the original show.  Episodes 1-3 of the OVA (Original Video Animation)is now presented unedited and redone.  Which makes this blu-ray a little more attractive to upgrade too even if you do own the original DVDs.

Note:  When I say original DVDs, I am talking about the older nine DVD sets released in 2005.  The new DVD set that contains all of the episodes does contain the OVA episodes now.",1386374400,51,3712,4.330914368650218
5841391,5,B00DPH7SZA,"For this who don't know, this is indeed the uncut, dubbed (and subbed) version that ADV Films released a few years back. If you watched this show as a kid, you probably remember it as Battle of the Planets or G-Force. This is your chance to view it in it's un-altered, un-cut state. Truly a masterpiece worth collecting.",1379030400,9,320,4.5344827586206895

5841393,5,B00DPH7SZA,"I do not have this item, but I am giving it 5 stars because I have been eagerly anticipating this release for some time now. I never got to purchase the ADV dvd releases from several years back, but the fact that this series is not only being re-issued on DVD but on Blu-Ray as well, simply makes my mouth water. I don't know anything about this particular distributor. I've never heard of them, but I'm going to assume that this will be all 105 episodes and I'm going to assume that they will do a bang-up job on them. With the announcement of a live action Battle of the Planets movie being released in Japan on August 24, 2013, I'm hopeful that a distributor somewhere will finally release Battle of the Planets: The Complete Collection (85 episodes) on DVD and perhaps Blu-Ray here in the U.S. soon. I know that it's available over in the U.K. as Region 2 DVD, but I'm talking about Region 1 for the U.S. and Canada. I have the 25th Anniversary Set that Rhino released back in 2004. Once again, I can't wait to pick this up on Blu-Ray. This is awesome!",1373241600,5,1056,4.338383838383838

5841395,4,B00DPH7SZA,"I remember watching this show on tv when i was a kid, It showed everyday after school. I would watch almost every episode. It was a long running series in japan. Thiats why the slip case is thick. Containing 22 discs that make up the whole series with in four disc jackets.  This a series loaded with a lot of action. The opening is still good. i still sing along to it, as the episode starts. I can watch this anime. Many times it doesn't get old.

5841396,4,B00DPH7SZA,"As a child I watched Battle of the Planets, which was based on Gatchaman.  Box says it has captions but it doesn't (only the opening credits are captioned).  Some of the translations lack a bit.",1476144000,,194,4.514285714285714
5841397,5,B00DPH7SZA,"This is a nice collection of the ADV films version. I had a few of the DVDs of the ADV set and rented the rest from Netflix years ago. So having it all on these blu rays were welcome sight. Plus it has the OVA although I haven't watched it yet on the blu rays but also had that on DVD.

If you grew up watching Battle of the Planets or heard of that from your parents, this is not your parent's Battle of the Planets. BotP was terrible in comparison because how butchered you will see it was. ADV now Sentai kept it as close to the original Japanese concept as they could. It has death and even the main hero isn't completely a boy scout like they made him in BotP. In the original version he slapped a girl for not firing a missile then forced her to fire it while BotP he gave a speech how her not firing the missile was the right thing to do so Jason (Joe's counterpart in BotP) fired the missile. BotP cut so much they had to do new scenes with a robot called 7-Zark-7 that was corny. No such robot in this series. And it's so much better for it.",1471478400,2,1050,4.0

5841400,5,B00DPH7SZA,"Absolutely superb series with excellent, indeed beautiful anime artwork. Quite dark in places, but suitable for resilient kids and adults from 5/6 upward. The BluRay version supports seamless switching from Spoken Japanese with English Subtitles to the English language dub. The English dub is excellent and much more authentic than the Battle of the Planets/G-Force versions shown in the late 1970s early 1980s which cut out the more violent parts replacing them with 7-Zark-7.
My 5 year old loves this, and I am really please he is able to follow the plot between episodes. Many modern cartoons are too short and self contained - this is truly epic and a visual feast.",1463011200,,670,4.991071428571429
5841401,5,B00DPH7SZA,The original series in one affordable set with excellent dubbing. Great fun in the tradition of SPEED RACER. Vastly superior to BATTLE OF THE PLANETS.,1462320000,,150,5.04
5841402,5,B00DPH7SZA,"I bought the blu-ray a bit ago. I am amazed by the condition the series manages to be in after being around for about 40 years. I feel the print lacks some color contrast, but other than that it is a beautiful transfer. It's listed as 16:9 widescreen, which is kind of true - it's the original 4:3 just with black bars on the side, which is pretty much on par with most fullscreen releases on blu-ray. It features commentary on select episodes with the English voice cast, which is fun to listen to.

I spent around $75 for it, though that's about $10-$15 or so more than I feel it's worth, I think it was worth it in the end. Thanks Sentai for re-releasing the Japanese and ADV dub in it's full uncut high-definition glory.",1459382400,,724,4.323529411764706

5841413,5,B00DPH7SZA,"I hate 7-Zark-7, always have, always will.  Even as a little kid, I thought of his monologues as extremely cheesy and boring.  I would turn to my mother and say, ""Why is 7-Zark-7 so awful Mommy?"" and she would reply, ""I don't know honey, that's just the way he is.""  Somewhere, deep down, I always hoped that a giant robot turtle part would come crashing down from the sky, crushing the robot and sending him to a watery grave, but it never happened.  Why did he make the series so terrible?  Little did I know that these were American additions to the story, to make up for the many edits of the Japanese version of the story, which was a bit more violent.  When I learned about this a few years ago, it all made sense.

There are many things that can be said about how bad the acting and interpretation of the stories are in the American version.  Kasey Kasem made a horrible Ken aka ""Mark"", and the other voice actors for the non-lead parts were even worse.  I guess I didn't notice too much as a child, but if you type ""Difference between Japan Gatchaman and US Battle of the Planets"" into Youtube, you'll see a good example of the differences.  The Japanese version is so much better, and that's why I'm so confused by the people with the nostalgia for the inferior Hanna Barbara version.

For me, I'm excited to revisit this series, seeing and hearing it the way it was meant to be shown.

As bad as the acting and everything was on the Hanna Barbara version was, I do have to give them credit for bringing this series to the States.  It wasn't perfect, but I understand their limitations, and I'm glad they imported something that was a highly enjoyable part of my youth.  They even got some things better.  G-Force is a much better name than ""Science Ninja Team Gatchaman"". Still, I'm glad that I'm finally able to watch this series in the way it was intended, and do not have to listen to the ramblings of 7-Zark-7.  Finally my youthful dream of a world without 7-Zark-7 has come true.

5841432,5,B00DPH7SZA,"I remember Gatchaman from my middle school days when it was broadcast in a highly edited and revised form called Battle of the Planets.  At the time, they were trying to capitalize on the success of Star Wars and cast this as a heroic space opera.  In fact, it's a wonderfully, exciting superhero show easily on par with the best of DC and Marvel Comics superheroes.  There is a nice balance in our superhero team.  Ken is the leader with just enough uncertainty to be interesting.  Joe is the second in command and clearly has anger management issue.  Jun is the explosives expert with a killer yo-yo.  Jin Pei is a wacky kid, but with some pretty mad skills of his own.  Ryu is the pilot who often gets them out of trouble.  Even their leader Dr. Nanbu is more than just a wise leader.  Frankly he can be kind of a jerk sometimes.  The villains are great and we love seeing what costumes the evil Galactor Group has decided to dress their middle managers in this week.  As a product of the 1970s, the one problem with this series is a decided lack of women, however, Jun has many strengths in her own right and she doesn't fawn over Ken so much as to be terribly annoying.

I bought the series in DVD because some of the special features were formatted as wide screen, even though they were filmed for 4:3.  With my TV/Blu Ray player combination, I can set the aspect ratio the way I like with the DVDs, but not with the Blu Rays.  Also, since this is a series from the 1970s and minimal cleanup and enhancement were performed to the originals, it seemed the DVDs were adequate in this case.",1409443200,2,1593,4.352542372881356

5841434,4,B00DPH7SZA,"Beautiful set with gorgeous artwork from Alex Ross, taken from the previous (super expensive) DVD releases and the covers of the US Comic books.

I've watched this show (as G-Force) as a kid and always wanted to revisit it. As technology improved to DVD I began looking around for a release. Unfortunately, the complete DVD set was prohibitively expensive, more than 200$ if I remember correctly. It had a very small print run and had gone out of stock by the time I checked. I made myself a promise I would stay on top of the next release and get it as it came out.

It took about a decade, but finally this show has been released in its entirety, it took so long that by this time Blu-ray was out. I am in love with Blu-ray and the quality so I bought this pretty soon after release.

I'm not sure how the previous release looked, but this one looks excellent. I have been steadily re-watching the episodes and having a great time. The presentation is clean and sharp with good audio.

There is only one problem with this release, and it is a pretty significant one: All Special Features (and there are quite a bit of them) have been stretched from 4:3 to fit 16:9, as a result all faces in the interviews look disproportionate and wide. This is inexcusable and very unfortunate since a lot of the feature show original artwork from development and it would have been great to see them properly. It looks awful and I cannot for the life of me understand what idiot made this decision. This is not industry standard by any means. This does not make an SD source look HD, all it does is fill the screen by stretching the picture. They could have upscaled the original source into HD and kept the original aspect ratio, or just left it alone completely (industry standard for old interviews) and either would have looked vastly better.

I hope the special features disks get replaced and urge everyone to send Sentai Filmworks a short message informing them you'd like a replacement: http://www.sentaifilmworks.com/contact

Obviously I am still very happy with this release and still 4 stars (would've been 5). I highly recommend this purchase to anyone who's a fan of the show or old Japanese anime in general... it really is a most unique form of storytelling, nothing like the anime of today (or the 80s, 90s etc). The botched special features should not keep anyone away, but does keep this from being the *perfect* release.",1408924800,8,2427,4.619489559164733

5841437,5,B00DPH7SZA,"One of my earliest childhood memories was watching Battle of the Planets which ran in the United States in 1978. What really set the cartoon apart from American cartoons was the maturity of the plots. There was a two-parter, which looking back I believe was the storyline `The Sky is Falling!"". Team leader, Mark, left the team to search for his father, whom he hadn't seen in year, leaving the team in some measure of disarray. It made a huge impression on me because it was so much more emotional than anything you would see in other cartoons from the times such as Superfriends.

As far as I was concerned Casey Kasem WAS G-Force leader Mark end of story. The cartoon was only available to me for a few seasons at most and it wasn't until I was a young adult that I started to search for a means to revisit the cartoon but it was tied up thanks to multiple companies claiming U.S. distribution rights. The only way to see the cartoon was to watch bootleg VHS tapes passed around by fans. Then in 2001 all the stars came into alignment and Battle of the Planets was finally released on DVD in the U.S.  by Rhino Videos but perhaps interest wasn't enough because they only rereleased less than 30 episodes.

In 2005 the original uncut, redubbed Gatchaman anime was released and it was a revelation.  7 Zark 7 was a sad U.S. addition, Galactor was composed of humans not aliens from Spectra and Casey Kasem turned out to be entirely inappropriate as the voice of Mark, I mean Ken. Kasem's smooth radio voice just doesn't work for the often emotional G1. The violence was exponentially higher and the stories more serious. The downside was it was 18 discs which take up a lot of space. So in 2013 we got the ultimate set; Gatchaman on Blu-ray which not only collects the 105 episodes but also the 1994 OVA which I particularly enjoyed. There are 14 discs but each case holds multiple discs so there are only 3 cases total. I had most but not all of the DVD Gatchaman but gave most of them away including the OVA which meant the total volume of my collection was slashed considerably.

So why would anyone who owns the Gatchaman DVD want to switch to this collection? Here are my top reasons.

1. Gatchaman is a great cartoon. The animation is way primitive but like Star Trek the Original Series it survives on writing. These are HD discs but the cartoons are 40 years old and you just are not going to get pristine images. They are, however, the best available.

2. The current Amazon price of $75 is a steal. That upfront cost may sound steep but if you had paid the listed price of $15 dollars for all 18 DVD discs it would have run you $270 bucks plus the OVA. Even at the manufacturers price of $150 it's still a deal compared to buying all the DVD's. For that cost you get 2770 minutes of entertainment.

3. The reduction in space was what sold it for me. I'm moving next month and I've been trying to reduce my volume of STUFF. The blu-ray collection occupies less than 1/6th the space of the 18 volumes plus OVA so I decided to go with the upgrade.

4. Let me repeat my first reason. This is a great cartoon. When you watch the series start to finish you see that it's much more than a mecha of the week. The characters and emotions feel real. It starts with just a fight between the five member science ninja team and Galactor but as things progress the anger and frustration boils over on both sides. The initially stoic Ken becomes less and less controlled as his fury towards Galactor and Berg Katse builds. Meanwhile Leader X's patience with Katse's continual failure increasingly wears thin even as Katse grows more desperate to destroy the science ninja team. It all builds to an amazing series conclusion. At about 23 minutes per episode and 105 episodes we're talking over 40 hours of buildup.",1404864000,16,3809,4.461206896551724

5841451,5,B00DPH7SZA,"I, like many of you reading this I suspect, grew up watching ""Battle of the Planets"" in the United States. It wasn't until many years later that I learned about Gatchaman and how Battle of the Planets was a modified version of the original.

I still have a few VHS tapes from the very early 80's with the original airings of Battle of the Planets on them, but other than that I largely had forgotten about the show for the past thirty years. There were some previous releases of Gatchaman on DVD but for whatever reason I never really looked into them.

A friend and I were recently having a discussion about Gatchaman as he is a fan too, which prompted me to look it up on Amazon. Much to my delight I saw that this new Blu-ray release had just become available. I ordered it immediately.

Now that I've received it I've watched a few episodes and am having flashbacks to my childhood. One day I will get the time to watch the whole series but for now just a few episodes are great. Having the option to choose between multiple languages and subtitles also provides several ways to experience these original episodes.

If you were a fan of Battle of the Planets then this is the set for you. You won't get 7-Zark-7 or 1-Rover-1 (those were added to the American version to make up for the scenes that were cut out), but you will get the original Japanese version of the shows with all their uncensored violence and original dialogue.",1389484800,5,1434,4.44106463878327

The menu is difficult to navigate through the PS3, but is fine through a standard Bluray player.  I have to go into the languages menu and then just come back out to get it to play in Japanese.  It looks like it's still on English, but it isn't.  I haven't tried accessing the extras through the PS3 yet. If your a fan, you can't do without this.  If you like Japanese animation and haven't ever seen Gatchaman, check it out.  It's a little dated, but it is the Mother of all great team oriented Japanese animation.

8595952,5,B00DPH7SZA,"Growing up in the early 80s, Battle of the Planets (BOTP) was my favorite show. I remember rushing home from school so I wouldn't miss the latest adventures of G-force and their battles against Spectra.  There was nothing like it at the time-- the animation, storylines, music, and acting were far superior to anything else back then.  BOTP was a complex drama, where everything else seemed to be more simple slapstick comedy.

Later in life (and thanks to Google), I found out that BOTP was actually edited from a Japanese series called ""Science Ninja Team Gatchaman"". In order to fill in parts that were considered too violent for American audiences, the BOTP editors added an annoying narrator-robot called 7-Zark-7, who would claim cities were evacuated prior to their destruction, or that fighter planes and tanks destroyed in battle were actually remote-contolled, etc.  Additionally, only 85 of the original 105 episodes were used, so BOTP viewers never got to experience the full story.  (As a child, although I never realized what I was missing, I remember being annoyed by the Zark scenes.)

Well, this is it-- the full unedited series of Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, translated into English, on Blu-ray. There are many differences between this and BOTP.  For example, every original scene is intact and there is no 7-Zark-7, no Center Neptune, and no cut-away scenes in the middle of important battles. Also, unlike BOTP,  the entire series takes place on Earth.  This is the way the series was meant to be seen, in its entirety.  The video and audio quality is excellent, and the voice actors did a great job bringing the series to life.  And although the series is 45 years old, it is surprisingly relevant to many issues faced today such as climate change, terrorism, and political upheavals.

With that said, there are actually two things that I liked better in BOTP.  First was the music.  Although BOTP used some of the original Gatchaman music, a new soundtrack was written specifically for BOTP which was incredible.  Second, was the voice acting. Although the voice actors for this Gatchaman blu-ray did a great job, BOTP had an all-star cast (Casey Kasem, Ronny Schell, Janet Waldo, et al.)  who brought a lot of emotion and were absolutely perfect for their characters (well, maybe except for Keyop...).

Despite this, I absolutely loved this blu-ray and was happy to experience this series in its entirety. I  highly recommend this series to any BOTP fan!",1504310400,13,2479,4.961259079903147
