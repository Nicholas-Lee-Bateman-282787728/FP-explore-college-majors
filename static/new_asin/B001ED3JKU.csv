8297798,2,B001ED3JKU,"As this is advertised as a ""collection"" and ""volume 1"", you might expect 4 or 5 dvds in one large case.  Not so; it's 11 individual cases shrink wrapped together with a photocopied label, which takes up a lot more space on your shelves.

So far, I've opened 4 cases and found 2 weren't as advertised on the case and on the disk graphic:  one contained a completely unrelated Mitzi Gaynor movie.  The other promised a ""bonus"" episode of a TV western  it did, but not the episode labeled on the exterior.

I want to point out that you definitely can find at least some of these titles in those ""50-Westerns-for-$15.99"" sets and you can buy 3 of those for less than what this costs.  On the other hand, the version of Whistling Skull in this set runs several minutes longer than in the cheap sets.",1464048000,3,794,4.397260273972603
8297799,3,B001ED3JKU,Bought this because they were shows I enjoyed as a kid. Still get nostalgic about them but print quality is awful as many Alpha films are which is why rating is 3. There must be good prints somewhere. Still I am enjoying nostalgia of an era long gone.,1424563200,3,251,4.25

8297801,3,B001ED3JKU,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

ALPHA's THREE MESQUITEERS ULTIMATE COLLECTION, Volume 1 brings together 11 previously issued discs in their original keepcases. Because these are hour length programmers, the entire set of 14 westerns could have been issued on 5 DVDs or less.

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser series all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Fifty-one TM westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony Brooke was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby Joslin was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan  split the Tucson Smith role almost equally.
(The Livingston/Corrigan/Terhune combo star in the 12 designated below as 'TM.')
