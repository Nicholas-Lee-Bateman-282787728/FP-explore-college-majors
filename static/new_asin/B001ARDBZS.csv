3465787,5,B001ARDBZS,"Containing all the traditional songs that have made the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta so popular over the years, this pleasing Australian Opera version adds some interpolated material from other G&S operas and an expanded finale that in itself has become common since the 1980's New York Papp version.  Thankfully there is less obvious ""ham"" in the performances here.  Anthony Warlow makes a dashing (and leering) Pirate King in the mold of Kevin Kline, John Dutton Wood is a cute and lovable Major General, David Hobson a handsome and lyrical Frederic, and Suzanne Johnson a serviceable Ruth, though she is not as funny as some of her competitors on other DVDs.  Once past the shock of seeing a blond Mabel (somehow all my many previous exemplars had dark hair!), Taryn Fiebig sang a good Mabel.  Richard Alexander has the best voice of all Sergeants on DVD, and his facial expressions are priceless!  The men's chorus is energetic and the women charming (watch the body language on the uncredited freckle-faced daughter!).  The orchestra is robust and plays the traditional score, not the rock-influenced versions so prevalent nowadays.  All in all  this is either the best or second best version on DVD and well worth the price.",1247097600,2,1231,5.0
3465788,5,B001ARDBZS,"Anthony Warlow's brilliant idea to transform the Pirate King into Jack Sparrow really makes this rendition of ""Penzance"" that much more amusing. The strong, pure voices, eloquence, humour, skilled acting, and fresh take on an aged tale turn this seemingly silly video into a timeless treasure. Wow, that was pretty sappy, huh? It really is as great as I make it out to be, though.",1246665600,,380,4.861538461538461
3465789,5,B001ARDBZS,"Think about how many times you've watched jack Sparrow and wondered what he would be like as G&S's Pirate King (You know you have, you G&S fans), and this may be the nearest you'll get to seeing it.  Anthony Warlow, always brilliant in his G&S roles, is also quite good at doing a Johnny Depp impression while singing and dancing his way through ""The Pirates of Penzance"".  That alone is worth seeing, but the rest of the production is just as charming.  The costumes are beautiful, the singing is excellent, and the Major-General as adorable in his Highlander uniform. The famous film and stage play, starring Kevin Klien,had a great deal of influence on this production, such as the expanded finale and the inclusion of the great patter song from ""Ruddigore"".  Fun and frolicsome, whether you love Gilbert & Sullivan, pirates, or both.",1231113600,,837,4.8321678321678325
3465790,4,B001ARDBZS,"I am resigned to the fact there will be nothing significantly new done to a treatment of ""Pirates"" since Joseph Papp. This production, with some promising innovations, took to itself many of Papp's ""Shakespeare in the Park"" contrivances with uneven results. On the whole, for those who have never seen ""Pirates"" before, you will be delighted. For those who groan at the mindless pastiches on the 1980's show, toss this one on the heap. Elements from Papp's production found here: the ""intimate"" staging, with lightbulbs adorning the periphery; abridged overture; the costumes in general; the ""matter"" patter trio translated from ""Ruddigore;"" and the ""New York"" finale. Unlike the Papp show, however, we are not subjected to synthesizers, even though there are some minor musical alterations. One real surprise was the inclusion of the original business in the Act II finale meant to remind one of ""Pinafore:"" ""All of them peers? Well, most of them..."" Anthony Warlow's treatment of the Pirate King as Jack Sparrow was a wonderful idea. One wonders why this was the only original artistic idea in the entire production. The sound was disapointing when the full chorus sang, although some solo passages were also very soft.  The film editing was very choppy and lacked the on-stage still-cam footage we saw in the company's production of ""Pinafore."" Still, it's probably the best version of the show on DVD to date.",1219795200,22,1413,5.0905172413793105
3465791,4,B001ARDBZS,"One of the most famous and loved Gilbert & Sullivan shows, performed by Opera Australia starring Anthony Warlow and David Hobson - one could be excused for expecting something extraordinary. I certainly did. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.

Firstly, I would like to say that this is NOT a poor performance. The talent and professionalism of the cast is obvious throughout and it is an enjoyable show. There were, however, a number of disappointments for me.

Firstly was the ""toy theatre"" set design. While the rationale for this is explained in interviews included as special features in the DVD and it sounds like a sound idea when you listen to these interviews, the bottom line is ""did it work?"" - I guess for me it didn't and an opportunity for a great set that really created the atmosphere was lost.

The second was the omission of the overture. For me, the overture of a Gilbert & Sullian show is as integral a part of the show as the rest of it and I am always disappointed when they are not included or even abridged.

Finally, was Anthony Warlow's portrayal of the Pirate King. Anthony commented in his interview that he was influenced by a couple of character's, including Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow form Pirates of the Caribbean. Unfortunately, his performance appears to be more of a blatant copy of this character rather than simply influenced by it. While this may be of appeal to some, for me it was a distraction. I have great admiration for Anthony Warlow both as a singer and an actor. I have seen him portray many fine roles and would have much preferred it if he had developed his own way of portraying the character, as I know he can do so well.

I was lucky enough to see this performance live before the DVD came out, so I knew exactly what to expect, but I still bought it. This probably reinforces that there is much to enjoy in this show. If I have come across overly critical of this show, it is probably because I know they could have done so much better with it. I did actually enjoy it. It is not, in my view, a poor performance, but a poorly perceived production of a great show.",1219622400,34,2125,4.509090909090909
3465792,4,B001ARDBZS,"I've seen most of this production on clips on the internet, as it obviously had not been released on DVD in the USA prior to this release.

The best part of this production is Anthony Warlow's new portrayal of the Pirate King.  In order to appeal to a new audience, he modeled his portrayal of the character after Johnny Depp's portrayal of ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" from Disney's  ""Pirates of the Carribean"" trilogy.  He clearly really studied that character as all he really matches the voice and the mannerisms of Jack Sparrow. His costume is also modeled after the costume of Jack Sparrow. At first I didn't like the idea of that when I heard he was going to do it, but now after seeing I really Love it.  It works VERY well in the operetta and gives a new unique spin on it.  I'm a big fan of this operetta, so if you are too, and if at first you don't like the idea, Give it a Chance!!!  I did, and I'm glad, because I REALLY enjoyed this take on the character.

Another special part of this is that is includes the song ""My Eyes Are Fully Open"" or sometimes known as ""Matter."" This song is originally from Gilbert & Sullivan's ""Ruddigore"".  It is occassionally done in Pirates of Penzance as a substitution for ""Duty, Duty"" with of course some different lyrics than Ruddigore.  Productions have the option to do whichever they want.  This cast performs ""My Eyes Are Fully Open"" wonderfully, and is further reason to buy this DVD.

Numerous members of the cast were also seen in Opera Australia's HMS Pinfore and Trial By Jury.  Including Anthony Warlow, David Hobson as Frederic and John Bolton-Wood as Major General Stanley.  They all play their roles wonderfully.  I've admired David Hobson for his acting and portrayal of characters.  He's not my favorite tenor voice, although it is good.  The singing in the production is good, although I have heard better voices play some of the roles in the past.  That's really only a VERY minor flaw though, because the singing is actually VERY good, just not the BEST I've heard.  That's the only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5.  I do prefer watching this production over previous ones that I liked the singing better on for better production reasons.

I highly recommend buying this DVD even if you already own a different version of Pirates of Penzance.  It's really a wonderful production.  Anthony Warlow's new portrayal of The Pirate King alone is worth the full price of the DVD.  Furthermore, it is a wonderful production as a whole.",1215388800,48,2493,4.613636363636363

3465863,5,B001ARDBZS,"I have to admit that I was initially skeptical about this version of ""Pirates,"" even after reading all the glowing reviews.  After watching it three times, however, my advice to you is not to hesitate for one moment to purchase this latest amazing version of ""The Pirates of Penzance.""  It is by far the best production of ""Pirates"" that I have ever seen, surpassing even the famed Linda Ronstadt/Kevin Kline 80's film version.  Anthony Warlow gives a wondrous performance and it was a bold stroke of genius to model his character after Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, THE definitive pirate.  Playing his Pirate King as Jack Sparrow serves to heighten the sexuality and appeal of the character while at the same time enhancing the overall entertainment level of the piece.  Kudos also to Taryn Fiebig for her spirited performance as Mabel.  Like Warlow's Pirate King, Fiebig's Mabel is by far the best I have seen.  She is flighty, funny, and flirtatious and her vocal acrobatics are truly astounding and a wonder to behold.  The part of Mabel has never been played to such absolute stunning perfection. Susan Johnston as Ruth is a marvel, as is John Bolton Wood as the diminutive Major General, and David Hobson makes a phenomenally fine Frederick.

People, this is THE definitive version of the ""Pirates"" musical, so you owe it to yourself not to miss it!!",1378080000,,1362,4.861471861471862
3465864,1,B001ARDBZS,"I purchased it originally, in the Blu-ray edition. I sent it back three times, none of the ones that were sent me would work in my Blu-ray player, nor two of my neighbors players. I finally purchased the conventional DVD version which works fine. But it is no thanks to kator",1358035200,,275,4.411764705882353
3465865,5,B001ARDBZS,This is a real fun Pirates. High standard singing from the Aussie singers. A clever and well presented production. The centre piece being a version of the Pirate King well sung by Anthony Warlow which is  heavily influenced by Johnny Depp's swanning about in Pirates of the Carribean. That performance was influenced by Rolling Stone Keith Richards! Funny how these things spread. This makes for a different and entertaining Pirates. It is well filmed and recommended (at least by me!),1329696000,,485,5.0625
3465876,4,B001ARDBZS,The Pirate King was fascinating - the costume and the unique mannerisms were astonishingly like Johnnie Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.  I wonder which came first?  Surely one modelled on the other!,1307318400,2,195,5.258064516129032
3465877,3,B001ARDBZS,"First, the stage setting is quite small and sparse for a Gilbert and Sullivan play. The costumes are too improved. The actors mostly mumble their parts. I was surprised to find that even the ""Modern Manor General"" was mumbled. I know that this is Australian but the whole entourage could use some elocution lesions.

The advantage in a live play is that you can insert local or contemporary jokes. They may be local and contemporary for the Australian audience; however, they were just annoying and distracting by the time they got to the US.

Moreover, the whole Jonny Depp (Jack Sparrow) portrait by Anthony Warlow is so contrived as to lose the original character of the play.  David Hobson (46 years old at the time) was excessively ancient and decrepit to play a 21 year old.

I only watched the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. But you could really see David Hobson's age. The sets were crisp and colorful. The DVD and Blu-ray has lack extras.

3465878,5,B001ARDBZS,"So far my experience with Australian Opera has been a complete success; their performances are light hearted and fun with good humor and good performances before enthusiastic audiences. This one is no exception to the rule.

I'm particularly fond of Pirates of Penzance and have several different recordings of it; when I saw this one by the Australian Opera I decided to add just one more to my collection and I'm glad I did. This one will leave you smiling as I'm sure it did the audience before whom it was performed.

As other reviewers have pointed out Anthony Warlow's borrowing of the Captain Jack Sparrow persona comes off just fine and adds a touch contemporary fans will appreciate and is certainly in the spirit of classic Gilbert and Sullivan performances.

If you're looking for an evening of Gilbert and Sullivan music presented in an enjoyable manner with lots of energy and fun this should fill the bill!",1286064000,,920,4.810126582278481
3465879,5,B001ARDBZS,"Despite an overly mature Frederic, albeit with a fine tenor voice, this is really superb entertainment, overcoming and nicely adapting to the rinky dink, tiny stage,. The humour is constant throughout, the singing and costumes gorgeous, the casting of the entire sets of ladies, pirates and police choruses outstanding, and the acting wonderful. As others have commented, the police sergeant is simply unique in voice, expressions and acting. Each member of each chorus is specially, tremendously representative of the groups' intended genre. The lack of a home grown, UK version of many G&S
works is rescued by the Australian groups fortunate productions.

This production compares very favorably with the early Ronstadt, Klien, and Lansbury VHS set which urgently needs remastering onto DVD (or better yet BluRay if the definition is available in the masters).

Ruth's portrayal, acting, voice, costumes and expressions are priceless as are those of the pirate king. Mabel's voice is thrilling. The ladies chorus is hilarious and endearing.

It's difficult to single out any character for individual praise when every member of the cast approaches perfection.

The director is naturally responsible for all of the well deserved praises of this presentation.

Criticism of nits in entertainment of this excellence to justify less than five stars is a reflection on the author thereof. Perfection in a stage production is rare, but this one is close enough to amuse and entertain anyone this side of the grave.",1274486400,,1510,5.3277310924369745

3465882,5,B001ARDBZS,"I had the great pleasure twice of experiencing this production in the theatre in Sydney and in Brisbane. John Wood was excellent as a British Raj Major-general and as others have noted, Anthony Warlow was a 'Jack Sparrow' Pirate King-this director's interpretation, helped by Warlow's great acting ability in Opera as well as Musical Theatre (he was a very fine 'Higgins' in 'My fair Lady' revival tour in Australia and the original most impressive and realistic 'Phantom of the Opera' in Melbourne) was both hilarious and in fine voice as the pirate king. The entire cast I saw, to be fair, was without fault. For me, this is a great remembrance of a memorable 'Pirates' to rank alongside his Opera Australia DVD of G & S' 'Patience' as Grosvenor alongside Dennis Olsen's superb Bunthorne, which I have seen thrice in the theatre. Mr Olsen is probably the best G & S exponent of the Grossmith roles I have ever seen. I recommend this to any lover of good acting and singing as well as great Gilbert and Sullivan (without bias as an Aussie of course).",1265328000,,1051,4.686486486486486
3465883,4,B001ARDBZS,"This is a great production of Pirates. It is closely modeled on the Joseph Papp version, including substituting the patter song from Ruddigore for ""Duty, Duty"" (a shame they couldn't have done both), but better sung and acted. I grew up watching the Papp movie version and still enjoy it very much, but I have to admit that this is considerably better.

I initially found Anthony Warlow as Jack Sparrow to be very disconcerting, even off-putting. He mimics Johnny Depp so convincingly (down to the tilted chin and swaying gait) that I was very distracted. By the second viewing, I was able to more or less ignore him. He does sing well, which makes up for many evils. And the Pirate King is always a bit eccentric anyway - he just takes it to a new level.

The female singers, in particular Mabel, were great. David Hobson as Frederic was fantastic. A bit old for the part, but I imagine you wouldn't notice that from the audience, and it's not really that distracting in the close-ups, either. His clear tenor is very similar to that of Philip Potter (my favorite D'Oyly Carte tenor), and his acting is very good. His diction is also very clear, even in the patter song.

I guess the highest praise is that I will likely watch this DVD over the Papp version in the future. And I wish Opera Australia would complete the DVD pantheon - I would love to see Mikado, Yeomen, Iolanthe, and Ruddigore with Warlow, Hobson and the rest of this cast. (Preferably before they get any older!)",1259712000,2,1481,4.56015037593985
3465884,4,B001ARDBZS,"Some years ago, I watched (over and over) Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline in this musical and loved it.  Recently, I became aware of these PBS versions of twenty of Gilbert and Sullivan comic musical.  This is my favorite of this project, as it is basically the same as the movie shown on HBO, wherewith one of the songs was altered to suit the pop culture back then.  I've now seen most of the collection and find that the music is somewhat the same using different words for the storyline.  This will always be my favorite.  Imagine attending the Queen's special ""teas"" to which only the most popular of her acquaintances were invited to enjoy these musicals.  It would appear that she had an obsession with their music and stories.",1252281600,,733,4.6
3465885,4,B001ARDBZS,"Better weigh anchor, landlubber ... or take something to steady your eyes.  There are several cameras working to capture this production--and it comes across in an unnatural way.

The cameras are constantly cutting to Anthony Warlow (adeptly impersonating Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") whether or not it makes sense.  Case in point, watch the clip of ""Modern Major General"".  The director, swept up in Jack-Sparrow mania, overdoes the reaction shots.  Very distracting--especially when the Major General is in the middle of his vocal line.

Not only are the camera cuts witness to the director's heavy-handed emphasis on Warlow/Depp/Sparrow but the final bows are as well.  It is highly unusual for a Pirate King to get the last bow in a Penzance production.  Usually, Mabel and Frederic do because they are the romantic leads and they are also the soprano and tenor.  Furthermore, the Major General is listed at the top of the cast in most any Penzance score, so it wouldn't be so very strange for the Major General to be last out at a curtain call.  While the Pirate King is important, there are four other lead characters in this show (Ruth rounds out the leads).  But the very-talented Warlow is lucky enough to have a director who lets him overstep the soprano, the tenor and the lead actor.  One wonders if an agent had worked Warlow's contract to get him the last bow.  The final bows wouldn't have bothered me as much if the camerawork hadn't already been overdone.

Of special note, Richard Alexander delivers a delightful interpretation of the Sergeant of Police.  And be sure to pay attention during the finale.  During a coloratura passage that just won't end, one of the females nearly gets a finger pushed down her uvula.  These sorts of humor-laced touches are pervasive throughout this Penzance, making it an essential addition to any G&S library--in spite of the camerawork being as choppy as the high seas.",1251331200,9,1954,4.908536585365853

It did not showcase Anthony Warlows reputable talent, but rather relied on a unashamedly bad impersonation that actually was a distraction for the whole of the show. Warlow's terrible Pirate King overshadowed the rest of the production, which is such a shame given the quality of material and talent available for this remake. Do yourself a favour and find a different version, or better yet lets all pray for one last attempt that might feature some amazing new and upcoming players with original ideas.",1504569600,,692,5.078947368421052

8279056,4,B001ARDBZS,"I enjoyed this adaptation of the classic Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.  Anthony Warlow as the Pirate King is a chameleon and speaks all his lines and sings as Cap'n Jack Sparrow from The Pirates of the Caribbean, my family found this spin on a classic character entertaining and delightful.  I find his performance a bit low key especially compared to Kevin Kline's performance in the highly recommended 1983 movie.  Aside from the Pirate King, this adaption is a fairly classic rendition.

I'm not a big fan of David Hobson's acting and stage presence as Frederic, he seemed a bit old to be Frederic who in my opinion should be a raring young buck, but he is adequate and his singing is top notch.  I was a bit off put by Frederic's costume change in Act 2.  He changes into a full modern looking bright white suit for some reason.  To me it doesn't match the time period this play is supposed to be taking place in and the suit is too loud.  I found it took me out a bit of the performance of the play.

Other supporting actors were adequate, General Stanley and his daughter's were fine classic renditions of the characters.

Finally, there are no subtitles included with this movie, I wish there was.

Anthony Warlow is an excellent Pirate King, and I also like the accent of the lady singing the part of Ruth.

8279060,4,B001ARDBZS,"I basically discovered this musical by accident: seeing the DVD at the library, I took it for a low-budget parody of pirate movies, and rented it. As a fan of musicals, I was pleasantly surprised to find that ""The Pirates of Penzance"" is actually a classic opera, from the 1800s, and that the Jack Sparrow parody was a modern spin, much like how Shakespeare productions nowadays insert modern references into the visuals. I also noticed that ""The Pirates: Band of Misfits,"" which I also enjoyed, seemingly borrowed a lot from this play.

Like all musicals, this one took time to grow on me. The first watch, all I got from it was singing pirates. All in all, some goofy fun, but I couldn't make heads or tails of the plot or much of the dialogue. So then (as with most musicals) I read up the plot synopsis, and re-watched it several times, until I knew the main characters' names, understood how most of the musical numbers fit into the story, and had the songs stuck in my head all week. I now have a new favorite musical.

On a side note, the idea of making the Pirate King look like Jack Sparrow isn't just a matter of ""selling out"" (no one said it was, but it's something I suspected some people might think). Looking at pictures from older productions, I see Pirate Kings who look like Disney's Captain Hook, and Errol Flynn's Captain Blood; it seems like the tradition for this play is to make the Pirate King resemble whatever the popular pirate icon of the time is.

I highly recommend this to anyone who loves musicals, pirates, and old-fashioned humor. In particular, anyone who enjoyed ""The Pirates! Band of Misfits"" might enjoy this, as both stories have similar set-ups (mixing 1600s pirates with Victorian aristocrats) and similar styles of humor.",1433289600,2,1762,4.659163987138264

Choreography is pretty good.
