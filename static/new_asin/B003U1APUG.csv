8405587,5,B003U1APUG,My American Nurse 1& 2 gives us American's a glimpse into a foreigner's life through his eyes. The story is told with humor and humanity.  I loved the films and I have an even better understanding of what foreigners face coming to America. It is very difficult at times to balance where you come from with where you are. This film is a must see.,1471564800,,345,4.3076923076923075
