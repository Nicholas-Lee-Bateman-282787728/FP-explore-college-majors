677680,5,6303534392,"I was reluctant to buy this because of a few negative comments about the people being too pretty/showy but I'm glad I did. Yes the students seem to be extremely flexible dancers and there is artistic lighting and filming, but I appreciated the effort. This video offers a dynamic flowing yoga session and conveys the feeling of being in a real class. The instructor is down to earth and sincere. As an intermediate student, I found it to be challenging yet doable. I would not recommend it for beginners, but I think intermediate students who like Ashtanga and Power Yoga will really like this tape.",1001030400,11,599,4.714285714285714
677681,4,6303534392,"I was skeptical after reading reviews, but I am so glad I ordered this and Vol. 2 - I loved this tape.  I only started yoga a month ago and was looking to go to the next level - these tapes did it!  Also, Bryan is the only instructor so far who makes me feel good about what I have accomplished and who stresses that there is no ""correct"" pose, that every body is different, and that yoga is an individual practice, not a comeptition.  And besides that, I can already see a difference physically.",1000684800,,496,4.2
677682,3,6303534392,"the video was great for a SHORT,SWEET and POWERFULL intermediate workout, it is motivating and having the students on the video practising to bk instuctions is well worthwhile. on a critical point of view bk doesn't refer to postures by the sanskrit/indian names which i feel is important for intermedites to learn/know
overall loved it -  thank you",997315200,2,349,5.017241379310345
677683,2,6303534392,"As an experienced practitioner of yoga, I assumed this video would be challenging, hence its title, Sweat.  I did not sweat or feel energized, strong, calm, or light, as Kest explained would occur.  Instead, I felt irritable and anxious, mostly due to his aggravating, aggressive tone.  Furthermore, he rushes through the poses too quickly to experience their benefits, especially considering that the warm up is slow, and not motivating.  The length of the video is also too short, as it does not allow the student to work every muscle.  Anyone who desires a serious workout that results peace and stillness should check out Mark Blanchard's tapes instead.",973814400,21,657,5.102803738317757
677684,5,6303534392,"This is a great workout. I have been using this video for a few months now  and I can really feel my level of strength improving. Some of the poses are  a bit challenging, but it gives you something to work towards. Plus, I like  his message that it is not about doing the poses perfectly, but just doing  you're best. I recomend this video for those who have done a bit of yoga  already and want a good workout.",965433600,11,412,4.1
677685,5,6303534392,When I started with this video I had no idea of what I was getting into. Over one year later I am still at it having gotten phenominal results. I give him his due and credit. Also I see nothing wrong with him showing what  yoga can do for an individual having his shirt off.  Keep it Bryan and  shoot for the star.,957571200,2,314,3.9523809523809526
677686,5,6303534392,"I have been practcing ashtanga yoga for years at different studios.  This tape does not disappoint, even for advanced students.  Bryan's voice is soothing, motivating...",947894400,6,169,5.72
677687,2,6303534392,"This tape is actually a cheesy version of a Yoga tape (in my humble opinion) and the quality is  quite bad (video/sound etc.)  But on a more positive note, if you can actually do many of the yoga poses, they are  fairly tough and you'll be sore the next day!",915840000,,258,4.12
7849832,5,6303534392,"I have been following Bryan for over 10 years now. He is one of my favorites. Easy to follow, beginner or advanced, fantastic practice. And I own all of his videos.",1357516800,,164,4.32258064516129
7849833,4,6303534392,"this is a challenging practice that will make you sweat. it also may make your shoulders hurt from holding downward dog for what seems to be an eternity. i do like this style of yoga, however i am looking for a gentler practice. for beginners, i would say go with the rodney yee tapes.",1123545600,,285,4.296296296296297
7849834,5,6303534392,"Not everybody likes Bryan's 1995 tape series, but these were my first yoga tapes and are still my favorites after all these years and many other tapes.  No other yoga teacher's tapes leave me feeling as simultaneously loose, strong and tingling as Bryan's do.  I feel that these workouts have also helped my athletic endeavors by making me much stronger, smoother and better able to move my whole body dynamically.  I really wonder about the people who say that these workouts didn't make them sweat -- from what I can tell, every pose has deeper and deeper levels you go to to increase the muscular, breathing and balance challenge in the pose.  I can't imagine being ""bored"" with these workouts when every pose seems to have endless potential.",1065830400,4,745,4.796875
7849835,4,6303534392,"I just completed this video, and I can not believe that I had been scared I wouldn't be able to complete it.  I admit that I wasn't able to do all of the poses to their fullest form, but I didn't sweat AT ALL.  (I should mention that I work out about 6-7 days a week and have had two years experience with power yoga) While it didn't do what it promised, Bryan did manage to make me feel looser and more relaxed (something extremely hard to do around finals time!).  All in all, I think it was worth buying, and I will definitely do it again, but if you are looking to sweat and feel your heart really pumping, this won't do it.",1042761600,,628,4.048387096774194
7849836,5,6303534392,"Bryan Kest just doesn't have too many videos that I don't like. I think I only gave one a less than favorable review and that may be simply because it didn't work for me personally at my level. But this video is one of Bryan's original, older sessions and it's excellent. It is a really powerful workout for folks who have some experience in Power Yoga and want to take it to the next level.",1039737600,,391,4.226666666666667
7849837,5,6303534392,"Bryan is one of the reasons I love yoga so much! This is the intermediate- advanced tape, but you can modify to your ability, if you have basic knowledge of the poses.
I take his class in Santa Monica, and although that is 2 hours or more, this is a good substitute when I can't make it. A great mind and body workout. And you see results soon.",1022803200,,344,4.073529411764706
7849838,5,6303534392,"I started w/ Ali MacGraw's ""Yoga Mind & Body,"" and then moved up to Kathy Smith's ""New Yoga Challenge"" and now Bryan Kest's video, ""Sweat,"" has once again advanced me further in my yoga practice.
Now, I do other yoga routines daily (along w/ strength training & cardio), but one day I week I like to work all the kinks out with a good power yoga video. It's not easy finding one that's challenging but do-able for me, and I'm quite pleased & thankful that ""Sweat"" fits the bill nicely.
You start w/ sun salutations, add warrior poses & side stretches (holding for several breaths), some twists & arm balances, and then to the floor for a little abs work, some forward fold variations, a nice long-ish backbend, and then you finish by stretching out your back with the plow pose. Well, that's the gist, anyway.
Bryan's instruction is fine, but not for beginners. It's more for people who already are familiar with the poses, who might appreciate some fine-tuning: he tells you where to look and what muscle(s) should be turning out while others turn in, etc. ... He seems quite gentle & motivating to me.
Yes, he does kinda pose a bit, which is a little silly but, hey, he's got a fine body, there, so power to him. And he handles his students in class, which, combined with his posing & the artsy production quality, comes off as kinda sexy -- something I've never seen nor did I expect to see in a yoga video. At first, it was a little odd to me, but now I think it's cool. He rolls people's shoulders under & pulls on their legs during relaxation pose and, man, that looks like it'd feel good!
Anyway, I think Bryan Kest's ""hands on"" yoga instructing is great, and I often try to extend my own body the way he's demonstrating on his students, and I find it helps me settle deeper into each pose. I've been doing this tape once a week for awhile now, and the time always FLIES by, and I'm always loose & refreshed when it's over. I have been challenged, but I haven't been frustrated. Cause, after all, its not about depth in a pose, but about breathing and feeling something, as Bryan reminds us throughout the tape. And, oh, you'll feel something, alright!",1022025600,11,2159,4.454545454545454
7849839,5,6303534392,"This is a challenging routine, but not a hard jump if you've been doing the 2nd workout for a while. So many yoga routines are so basic and easy. It's hard to find one that is challenging, yet is easy-to-follow and feels like a well designed program. Clearly Kest knows what he's talking about. And his reminders to breathe, or lengthen your spine or to relax a muscle are perfectly timed every time.
Go for it! You'll love it.",1014854400,,427,4.417721518987341
7849840,5,6303534392,"When I lived in California, I took Bryan Kest's class in Santa Monica and just loved it.  As much as I miss the classes, this is the next best thing.  In some ways it's better because you can see him on the television, as opposed to trying to find him in a 100+ person studio.  This tape is definitely for the advanced yoga person and is quite challenging.  The participants in his video are very proficient at the postures. I learned a great deal of modifications to the way I was doing the postures because he is able to explain them in better detail and you can view his participants very clearly on the tape.  He has taught many celebrities and so his class was always filled with people, but it was nice that I could ""take"" his class with me when I moved 3,000 miles away.",1014422400,5,777,4.258503401360544
7849841,5,6303534392,"I love this tape, and I love Bryan's classes.  I'm so disappointed when I read less than enthusiastic reviews about Bryan's voice or technique.  But then I remember my first impression of him a few years ago at my first yoga class.  But now, I find him to be very real, very positive without seeming too pious or unapproachable, and just a little unconventional, which is great because it says to me that ANYONE can benefit from this practice. And that's how he is in person.  I appreciate his emphasis on just being where you're at...if you're truly in the experience, it just works.  My advice to those who find these small things annoying is to continue the practice...the tolerance that results will amaze you.  And oh yeah, he doesn't have all that hair anymore.",1009411200,4,767,4.644444444444445
