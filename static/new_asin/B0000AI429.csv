1906506,4,B0000AI429,"I bought this DVD because holiday episodes are only played at Christmas and I had never seen it. Also, these shows aren't on any of the other collections we own. Not my son's favorite, but it's still a good collection.",1187827200,,218,4.475
1906507,5,B0000AI429,My little one LOVES this DVD the most. He completely gets the idea of the holidays. It's good they put a collection together that shows how Steve met Blue and how Joe was just a baby. The other episodes go along with the winter theme. Great!!!,1185321600,,243,4.304347826086956
1906508,5,B0000AI429,"This episod is very cute as they showing Joe and Steve when they were little. My 2 little boys love to watch and pretending like them.

Older brother and baby brother they are gather and hug each other...they just love to watch this episod over and over!",1182038400,,254,4.404255319148936
1906509,5,B0000AI429,My daughter (almost 4) just loves all the Blue's Clue's stories. And I as a mom don't feel too bad to sit my kids (my son is 21 months old) in front of the TV while I am cooking. Kids can really learn a lot from Blue's Clues and my daughter even responds to Steve or Joe when they ask something. The length of the episodes is just the right one as well.,1170892800,,353,3.8493150684931505
1906510,4,B0000AI429,This DVD is really nice for explaining all the holidays.  Keeps it simple and fun.  The bonus episodes are good too.  Some of these aren't shown often at all.,1168560000,,158,4.379310344827586
1906511,5,B0000AI429,"My 2-year old grandson loves Blue's Clues dvd's.  So, I bought two of them for his stocking stuffers.  He loves them and watches them every afternoon while he scoots around the house.  I found the service at Amazon great, and I thank you.

1906512,5,B0000AI429,"I guess we have more Blues Clues videos and DVDs than any other character. He's been a favorite of my son's since before he was one year old. Now he's almost 2 1/2 and has begun to develop more serious tastes. He'll actually watch many more programs geared towards older kids, and even adults, but he still likes his Blues Clues now and then.

This holiday Blues is very special for a couple of reasons.  ""Blues first Holiday"" tells the tale of how Steve first met Blue.  The other surprise is that it even features Steve's brother Joe when Joe was just a baby.

The second episode is ""Joe's Surprise Party""  has the whole gange getting ready for Joe's surprise birthday party while trying to keep it secret from Joe.  A unique episode in that other characters play the Blues Clues game rather than Joe.

Great fun for your little one!",1107734400,,835,4.490066225165563
1906513,5,B0000AI429,"If I had kids, and I were to pick one show for my kids to watch, I would pick Blues Clues.  I find that too many little children are sitting in front of the TV watching nonsense shows that talk to them like babies.  When you start out that way, how are you suppossed to end up?  These shows can hold a child's attention like I've never seen before, and they are packed full with learning things.  In everything that Joe does, he is teaching the children something.  If you are going to let your children watch something, this is a show I would recommend, well actually all of the Blues Clues episodes.  Patton does an amazing job!  There he is, this guy, acting all by himself in front of a screen with nothing, it totally amazes me!  So, if you want a show that will encourage the development of your child's learning skills, chose Blues Clues. (I personally like the holiday one, it's cute)",1069200000,4,892,4.363636363636363
1906514,5,B0000AI429,"For my now three year old, when Steve went away he was so sad that he didn't really take to Joe.  He had mostly watched re runs on noggin.  And for nearly a year now, he did not like to watch Blue's clues, because he know Steve has gone away or will leave.  But after watching this episode, he was so excited to see Joe as a baby, and Steve as a young boy -- exactly the age group that appeals to 3 to 4 year olds, and he watched with a 4 yr old friend, and both absolutely loved it.  And, to my relief, its brought back his love of blue.  And he is so thrilled to see those bonus episodes -- ""Steve is all grown up now!  He's a big boy!""  that it has brought the concept of growing home to him like nothing else.
The cover episode is a lovely story line about how Blue puppy comes to join Steve.  We buy all of these for the bonus Steve episodes which we already own on VHS :-)  Wish they would just go ahead and put the episodes on the Main Menu, instead of one level of ""Bonus"" indirection.  Anyway, Joe or Steve, Blue's Clue's is so educational and appealing, its absolutely not to miss.  This one has the Blue's Big Holiday VHS episodes as bonus.",1067731200,45,1151,4.004385964912281
1906515,5,B0000AI429,"The stories included on this DVD made it a Christmas favorite this year.  There was a show about how Steve got Blue, a show about a snowy day, a Christmas show & a show about Joe's birthday.  This DVD was watched every day for over a week.

1906562,5,B0000AI429,"Let's start off by saying that, while this is a great DVD, the Blues Clues people really missed the boat replacing a great character like Steve with a complete misfit like Joe.

If you can get past his absolute ridiculousness, this is actually a very cute childrens ""holiday"" movie.  They are very careful to never (or rarely. I can't promise that they never say 'Christmas') favor 1 religion or holiday tradition over another.  They are shown celebrating alot of holiday traditions in alot of different cultures.  What's more, they also tell the story of how Blue came to be Steve's and the movie even features a phone call from Steve himself!!

Overall a very cute holiday movie for the kids!",1229472000,,694,4.75
1906563,5,B0000AI429,"We bought this item as a pre-Christmas gift for our 3 1/2 year old son. We watched it during our family movie night. Our son loved the featured episode and loved seeing Joe as a baby.

It is a great story that details how Blue came to live with Steve as well as a telling of the first time they ever played Blue's Clues. I would recommend this to anyone who knows a child that loves Blue's Clues.

After watching the featured episode about 29 times, our son moved on to the other episodes...two are of the holidays and the last is about Joe's birthday. He loves them all.
