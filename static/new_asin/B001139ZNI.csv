8240122,3,B001139ZNI,"We like the Flushed Away movie, and were super excited to watch the Singing Slugs bonus video.  What a HUGE letdown!  The video is rediculously short, and certainly not worth the plastic used to make the extra DVD used for the video.  Really could've been added to the main DVD.",1327276800,,278,4.52
8240123,3,B001139ZNI,"The main DVD was missing - only the singing slugs mini DVD was in package - they refunded the entire purchase price, and told me to keep the mini DVD. Would have liked the DVD as advertised, but very happy with service.",1287705600,,219,4.238095238095238
8240124,5,B001139ZNI,"one of the funniest animated films i have ever seen!......with the great voices of WOLVERINE and GANDALFF and the french frog hahahahaha......""were fashionable late"".....and just a great fun time with this movie.....and get a load of the fast running slugs.......from beggining to end just a lot of fun....ENJOY...WATCH OUT FOR THE FRENCH TICKELER....... is mostly a lot of adult funny lines",1265846400,2,391,5.426229508196721
8240125,5,B001139ZNI,"I loved to watch this one with my son. He was very excited to learn about the ""under-life"" - the life in the sewer :)
The songs are catchy and the graphics are really cool.

I highly recommend this one for any family out there!",1254182400,2,227,4.044444444444444
8240126,3,B001139ZNI,"My children took some time to warm up to flushed away.  I purchased the DVD as I was told it was similar to Wallace and Grommit (claymation).  However, 1,000 Singing Slugs was not worth it as it is merely 8 minutes long.",1207526400,10,220,4.214285714285714
