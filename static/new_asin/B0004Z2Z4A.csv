2156520,5,B0004Z2Z4A,"I LOVE THIS VIDEO,AND I'M AN INTERMEDIATE EXERCISER. TAMILEE DOES A GREAT JOB AND SHE'S ALWAYS INSPIRING. I'M 38 AND THIS WORKOUT IS GEARED TOWARD US WOMEN (YES, LADIES...YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE) THAT ARE HEADING FOR THAT BIG 40 AND HAVE THINGS THAT NEVER SAGGED BEFORE START HEADING SOUTH NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

THIS WORKOUT ADDRESSES THAT AND IT COMBINES STRENGTH TRAINING WITH THE BANDS WITH 2 DIFFERENT CARDIO ROUTINES. NOW, I'VE HEARD NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT THIS VIDEO THAT THE CARDIO ISN'T THAT GREAT. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS VIDEO ISN'T GEARED TO THE TWENTY SOMETHINGS...BUT IT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT CARDIO PROGRAM. I SAW NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. ALSO REMEMBER THAT SHE WASN'T PUTTING 100% INTO THE MOVES BECAUSE SHE

1. IS EXERCISING IN THE HOT SUN ON A NICE BEACH, SHE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO LEAD YOU THROUGH THE EXERCISE ROUTINE WITHOUT BEING OUT OF BREATH.

2. TELLS YOU CONTINUALLY THAT YOU CAN STEP ALL OF HER MOVES UP TO PLYO AND POWER MOVES IF YOU'RE UP TO IT. NOW, I DID JUST THAT AND THIS ROUTINE GOT ME SWEATING AND I HAD A GREAT CARDIO WORKOUT.

THE TONING PORTION ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE PROGRAM, IT'S OUTSTANDING AND I FELT IT FOR DAYS IN MY LOWER HALF NOT TO MENTION THE AB ROUTING ALSO KICKED MY BUTT.

TAMILEE IS AN OUTSTANDING INSTRUCTOR. I ALSO HAVE HER LOSE FAT FAST DVD AND HYPNOSIS AND SHE ROCKS IN THAT ONE, TOO!

REMEMBER, IF YOU PLYO/POWER ALL OF HER MOVES YOU'LL GET A FANTASTIC WORKOUT. DON'T FORGET ALSO TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY MOVE,(TAMILEE IS BIG ON THIS) FOR INSTANCE, MAKE A MUSCLE CONTRACT ON EVERY MOVE, LIKE A REPEATER...CRUNCH YOUR ABS TIGHT WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT, OR BEND YOUR LEGS SLIGHTLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING KICKBACKS. YOU CAN ALWAYS FLEX A MUSCLE ON EVERY MOVE, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE JUST STEPPING LEFT AND RIGHT, SQUEEZE THOSE INNER THIGHS TOGETHER WHEN YOU COME IN AND TIGHTEN WHEN YOU STEP OUT, STUFF LIKE THAT. USE AS MUCH MUSCLE FOR EVEN ALL OF YOUR EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES AND YOU'LL BURN TWICE AS MANY CALORIES.

TRY IT! YOU'LL LIKE IT!",1108771200,10,1988,4.490304709141275
2156521,2,B0004Z2Z4A,"This video was very slow paced, great if you are just starting to workout. If you are at an intermediate level buy Tami's ""I want that body"" vidoes. They are much, much better and to a faster more upbeat pace. I have to say this video is one that didn't take a whole lot of time or thought, I think she just put it together for some extra dough! NOT one of her best works.",1101686400,25,372,3.973333333333333
2156522,3,B0004Z2Z4A,"I received a preview VHS version of this video.  Tamilee has always been one of my favorite instructors, but I found this workout to be a mixed bag.  The first section, Fat Free Cardio, consists of 2 cardio segments.  In both segments, Tamilee mixes low impact cardio moves with ""power"" sections--basically, about 30 seconds of focused toning at a quick pace.  Tamilee leads you through several different movement combinations and than goes back and starts the entire routine from the top.  This is repeated 2-3 times, sometimes with the power moves, sometimes without.  Cardio 1 is 20 minutes long, and although the moves are simple--marches, box steps, mambos--the combinations are often fairly complex, and I had a hard time following along, especially given that Tamilee's cueing was not optimal.  Cardio 2 is a bit longer at 25 minutes, and although the choreography was still complicated, I found it slightly easier to follow along here.  Again, the moves are pretty simple and include knee lifts and charlestons, but Tamilee's cueing suffers more here, and she is sometimes using the wrong leg at the wrong time.  In both segments, the power moves consist of squats, leg lifts, and kicks.  Overall, the cardio section provides a good, low impact, low intensity workout which would be best suited to someone who likes going through several repetitions of various combinations.

The second section of this video is called Metabolism Jump Start and is toning/strength focused.  This section uses a fitness band (included with the video) and is divided into three segments:  lower body, upper body, and abdominals.  The 10-minute lower body section may be worth the price of the video alone.  It begins with simple side steps with the band around your ankles, and within two minutes, I could really feel the burn in my outer hips.  A series of leg lifts from various positions ensures that all of the muscles of your legs are worked in this short, intense sequence, and the ""penguin"" move finishes off the hip area.  The 11-minute upper body segment is performed using the band in a seated position.  For each move, Tamilee performs one set slow and then one set fast, first working each arm alone and then both arms together.  Again, she makes sure to address every upper body muscle group, including the biceps, triceps, shoulders, chest, and back. This difficulty level of this segment is variable depending on how you hold the band.  Finally, Tamilee ends the workout with a 12-minute Pilates-inspired abs segment (without the band).  This segment is quite challenging, largely because Tamilee moves very quickly through the movements.  She begins with a side plank, moves on to a challenging leg scissors move while on your back, continues with full plank and all fours moves, and then repeats the entire series.  This is an intermediate to advanced abs workout which is best suited to those who have prior experience with Pilates or other core-focused work.

I definitely liked the toning segments of this workout: the addition of the band helped me to really feel the lower body section, especially in my hips and thighs.  However, I found the cardio to be disappointing and am not likely to use this section on a regular basis.  If you have liked Tamilee's cardio work in the past, this video might appeal to you, but the main reason to buy this video is for the lower body toning work.",1101081600,51,3397,4.91578947368421

8036168,2,B0004Z2Z4A,"I got a hold of the Defy Gravity *book* and was really pulled in. I thought this was a work-out program I could follow and help me keep in shape during my 40s.

Though the book is complete in itself, I hoped the video might present the workouts on video and make my task even easier. I wanted to follow a video and not have to stop and start as I followed exercises in the book.

The video hasn't anything to do with the book. What a disappointment.

Perhaps the creators of the video thought such a thing would be redundant, and chose to make something totally different. But why mislead us with the Defy Gravity title? Me, I don't care about redundant! I wanted Tamilee to make working out simpler for me! I would have happily paid for such a video.

Taken on its own terms, I found the video kind of short with the segments only 20 and 25 minutes, and the footwork was confusingly fast and frustrating to learn. For about 6 years now, I've been doing many of Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds videos, which are dead simple to follow--I suppose that is the level of my ability to do fancy footwork.

In sum, liked the book--disappointed with the video.",1297987200,2,1158,4.367441860465116
8036169,2,B0004Z2Z4A,"Buyer beware.  I had rented this dvd previously, so I knew basically what I was getting--except I thought I was getting the exercise band.  The strength workouts are good.  The short lower body workout is a killer--that is, if your DVD comes with the band.  I don't know why some people received the band included in their DVD boxes and some didn't.  I was one of the unlucky ones who didn't get one.  I don't know how you are supposed to do these exercies without one.  I feel like I've been gyped.  I happen to have a band from another DVD, otherwise this dvd is useless.  Tamilee has never been a good at cueing her aerobics.  This one is no exception.  The first cardio is a little easier to follow--the second is probably impossible to follow without several practices.",1295308800,2,774,4.496402877697841
8036170,3,B0004Z2Z4A,its a pretty good video. very disappointed though - it says it comes with the exercise band you need but it doesn't now i have to go find one.,1282435200,,142,3.9310344827586206
8036171,1,B0004Z2Z4A,"I am so disappointed!  The product description here on Amazon, as well as the description on the back of the DVD case, claims product includes the sports band you need.  WRONG!  Now I have to hunt down one, wherever they sell the things, just to do the workout that uses it, when it was supposed to be included -- one of the reasons I ordered this instead of another product.  I am so mad!",1228435200,,389,4.216216216216216
8036172,5,B0004Z2Z4A,"This workout is perfect for the workout-phobic.  I can do this workout!  And do enjoy it pretty much every time I do.  Every time she says ""come on, you can do it - I believe in you"" I honestly believe her (unlike Denise Austin and a lot of others).

If your workouts are sporatic and you are looking for motivations instead of painful workouts that feel like major work (i.e. make you feel like you're going to keel over and pass out), I highly recommed this workout.

With that said, the other reviews are correct - the workout is not as hard core as other videos like The Firm.  But!

This is one of the first videos of hers that made me really like her.  Since then, I've been able to tackle her other videos like her I Want That Body series (which I found too challenging when I first started working out).

The only part I don't like about the video?  She says the video is for the over 40's.  I am definitely not over 40 (was in my 20's when I first bought this DVD).",1227398400,6,974,4.1550802139037435
8036173,3,B0004Z2Z4A,"Tamilee starred in the original Buns of Steel videos and she's been an instructor for many many years so she knows her stuff.  However, Tamilee has done better dvd's than this.  It's OK, but not the best.  It's set on location at a beautiful Hawaiian oceanside.  There are two sections; back-to-the-basics aerobics and toning with a resistance band that you get along with the dvd.  The two sections are designed for fat burning and body shaping.  It is a total body workout that's sometimes a little tricky to follow along with.  The aerobics is a motivating mix of classic cardio along with some intervals and some lunges and squats.  In the toning section there is 3 10-minute sections that use the band you are given.  She ends the workout with pilates style abdominal work.  I just think this lacked something and I don't think she cues very well here.  It is a good workout for your body, but for something a little better to follow, try her I Want That Body series.  There are some great workouts in those series'.",1138492800,10,1021,4.611111111111111
8036174,3,B0004Z2Z4A,"There are 2 workouts on this DVD: Fat Free Cardio and Metabolism Jumpstart.  It comes inside a box with a 12"" sports band and a pamphlet with a menu plan.

Fat Free Cardio is chaptered into: Intro, Cardio 1 and Cardio 2.  Each cardio section is about 15-20 minutes.  Tamilee is by herself on a wooden platform on the oceanside of Maui-very nice production.  It's very sunny and I wish that I was there, too!  Music is okay (non-vocal).  The cardio is mediocre low-impact and be hard to follow at times.  I didn't care for these sections.

Metabolism Jumpstart is chaptered into: Intro, Lower body, Upper body and Abdominals.  The toning sections are around 10 minutes each.  Tamilee is by herself on a wooden platform on the oceanside of Maui-very nice production.  It's very sunny and Tamilee is squinting alot.  Non-vocal music is okay.  In Lower body and Upper body, Tamilee uses the sports band that's included with the DVD.  These toning sections are what makes the DVD worth keeping.  The band is used for tightening the glutes, hamstrings, triceps, biceps, chest, deltoids, etc.  My only problem was keeping the band in place around my ankles for the lower body section.  It kept creeping up or sliding down!  Once it stayed in place, the workout was great!  The Abdominals section was pretty challenging-pilates style that uses the core for stabilization.  I enjoyed this section.

There are quite a few bonus material on this dvd:

1. Yoga/stretch workout
2. Abdominal core workout (different from the Abdominals in Metabolism Jumpstart)
3. Option to workout to music without narration
4. Photo gallery

5. Trailers of Tamilee's other workouts:
  a. Lose Fat Fast: Cardio & Self Hypnosis
  b. Fit to the Hits: Rock Hard Assets
  c. Fit to the Hits: Motown Moves
  d. I Want That Body
  e. Tighter Assets: Cardio Blast
  f. Tighter Assets: Weight Loss
  g. Total Stretch for Beginners

6. Audio Features: Dolby Digital 2.0 or 5.1
7. Credits

I like Tamilee-she's soft spoken and polite.  Tamilee is very fit and she looks really good (she tells you in the workout that she's in her 40s).",1132704000,17,2095,4.788732394366197
