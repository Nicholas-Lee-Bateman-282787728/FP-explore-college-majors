1879623,1,B000095J00,"It would be a great instructional video if the lady would do the dance in the direction you will be practicing it after they teach it. Meaning - the instructional lady is facing AWAY from you when they are teaching the moves then the practice run is everyone, with the music playing, facing TOWARDS you - which means all the steps you just learned you have to do backwards from the way you learned them. Maybe simple for some but it was really confusing for me and my children trying to do it together. It would have been nice if she would have taught you facing you and then practiced with all the actors facing you.",1401926400,2,617,4.327586206896552
1879624,2,B000095J00,"The steps are a little hard to follow, would be easier if you could see the back view as well. Thought there would be more than just a few dances on this video.",1326153600,2,160,3.878787878787879
1879625,4,B000095J00,We had a girls weekend up at the lake with a Cowgirl theme. We wanted to line dance and needed some instruction. The instructors were a bit quirky but the dances were fun to do.,1231459200,5,177,4.085714285714285
1879626,3,B000095J00,"This video is well done. But, on the other hand, I was ""very"" disappointed that the dances that were taught were not the same ones listed on the cover of the video.  The dances taught were: Black Velvet, Wild Wild West, Tulsa, Kentucky Chug, Reggae Cowboy, and Tumble Weed (sometimes referred to as Rolling Bushes).  Some of these dances are really more advanced.",1221177600,14,363,4.746031746031746
1879627,1,B000095J00,"This video is not what I thought it would be.  They take you through steps real quick and expect you to keep rewinding the tape to learn the dance steps.  It really sucked.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

I thought they would have music that played the whole song after you learned the dance -- it would have been nicer at a slower pace.",1168473600,48,343,4.151515151515151
7989659,5,B000095J00,"Enjoyed the video, just wish it had the more popular dances like the electric slide & boot scootin boogie. I would like to find the other videos in the series but they were not listed on Amazon.",1492473600,,194,4.27027027027027
