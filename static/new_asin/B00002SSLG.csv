7916214,5,B00002SSLG,This was a great tape. It was short only running about an hour but it's nice to see Sid get his own tape. One of the overlooked wrestling stars of the 90's. I hope WWE will produce a best of Sid dvd in the future. In this tape you get clips of his matches from his debut to Fall Brawl 1999. You get to hear from the man himself out of character.,1359331200,,345,3.8055555555555554
7916215,3,B00002SSLG,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one that was one of the third ""WCW Superstar Series"" that WCW started releasing around late 1999 that ran around an hour long.  Sid was in character here as he hosted this tape which covered his 3 months in his 1999 return to WCW.  The various highlights of this tape include his association with Team Madness from return at the Great American Bash to helping Randy Savage win the WCW Title at the Great American Bash, his alliance with Rick Steiner, his win over Sting at Road Wild with Sid commenting on how important that victory was, the night he dominated Nitro to get a shot at Hogan's World Title, declaring himself the ""Millennium Man"" & beginning of his winning steak, his U.S. title victory over Chris Benoit, and the beginning of his buildup to his showdown against Goldberg.

Now this project comes of as heavily rushed as Sid was only in WCW for 3 months at this time so they didn't have much material to work with while completely ignoring his previous runs in WCW (Skyscrapers tag team & member of Horsemen) past stating that coming back to WCW was like ""coming home.""  with the exception of maybe 2 matches, none of these highlights have been released onto DVD in full & I honestly don't expect any of them to since Sid never turned out to be the big star he was pushed to be by both WCW or WWE so if your a fan of Sid Vicious then this is something to look for but if you aren't then you can easily pass this.",1300060800,,1538,4.329861111111111
7916216,5,B00002SSLG,"Great video! As another viewer has already said, there should have been more. I can't find any other videos with Sid like this one. He's one of my favorite wrestlers. I just ordered a shoot interview of him off of RF video. I don't know what it's like yet, but I'm sure it'll be good.",1138752000,,284,4.181818181818182
