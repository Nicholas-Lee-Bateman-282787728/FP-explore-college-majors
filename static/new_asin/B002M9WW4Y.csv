With the latter, all five movies are in individual slimline cases.

Best here is THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. While GUYS AND DOLLS is a Broadway screen adaptation (in which Marlon Brando sings ""Luck Be a Lady Tonight""), Frank's performance of Van Heusen/Cahn's ""High Hopes,"" the only real tune in Frank Capra's A HOLE IN THE HEAD, won them a Best Song Oscar. (Sinatra convinced Capra to come out of retirement and direct this movie version of Arnold Schulman's play.)

The film reunites Frank with Eleanor Parker, his co-star in Otto Preminger's brilliant drama,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MAN-WITH-THE-GOLDEN-ARM/dp/B00143XE00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM</a>&nbsp;(1955) (a picture that in this reviewer's opinion tops all of these later works).

It's often been rumored that the Cold War political thriller ""Manchurian Candidate"" was withdrawn from circulation following JFK's 11/22/63 murder, but this isn't true. It did however receive limited airplay throughout the later 1960s and '70s.

As in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LI-L-ABNER/dp/B0007TKGXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LI'L ABNER</a>&nbsp;(1959), Stubby Kaye's songs are showstoppers in GUYS AND DOLLS. Frank is typically great in this screen version of a Damon Runyan short story and Brando, thanks to voice editing from multiple takes, does a credible singing job in the starring role of gambler Sky Masterson. Gravel-voiced B.S.

3952142,5,B002M9WW4Y,"This collection contains:

Guys and Dolls (1955) - Directed by Joseph Mankiewicz and costarring Marlon Brando. Brando and Sinatra play two New York gamblers. Brando's character bets Sinatra's character that he can get any woman to go to Cuba with him and lets Sinatra pick the woman. Sinatra's character picks a devout woman from the Salvation Army. A very good musical comedy.

A Hole in the Head (1959) - Directed by Frank Capra and costarring Edward G. Robinson. Sinatra plays an irresponsible widower constantly getting bailed out by his older brother (Edward G. Robinson). His brother puts the condition for any future help to be remarriage to a solid responsible woman. A very delightful little film.

The Manchurian Candidate (1962) - Sinatra shows his dramatic chops in this one as a previous POW who thinks that he's been brainwashed to forget what happened while he was imprisoned in Korea. Specifically he thinks he has been programmed to forget what Raymond Shaw (Lawrence Harvey) did there. The important thing is that Raymond's stepfather is about to become a vice-presidential candidate. An excellent thriller directed by John Frankenheimer.

Sergeants 3 (1962) - Directed by John Sturges, this is a retelling of Gunga Din in the old west starring ""The Rat Pack"", of which Sinatra was a member. The thing about the Rat Pack movies is that you have to watch them with an appreciation for watching a group of really cool guys hang out together and not give the story that much deep thought. If you do that this film is quite enjoyable.

This is one of the best of the several ""Star Collections"" that MGM/UA is putting out this fall. This is basically just a repackaging of previously released DVD stock, so that is the reason that the price is so low. In fact MGM already has a set that has three of these films in it plus two more -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frank-Sinatra-MGM-Movie-Legends-Collection-The-Manchurian-Candidate-Guys-and-Dolls-The-Pride-and-the-Passion-A-Hole-in-the-Head-Kings-Go-Forth/dp/B000PMFS5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frank Sinatra MGM Movie Legends Collection (The Manchurian Candidate / Guys and Dolls / The Pride and the Passion / A Hole in the Head / Kings Go Forth)</a>&nbsp;Thus this set is highly recommended if you don't already own these movies.",1251504000,11,2342,5.440771349862259
