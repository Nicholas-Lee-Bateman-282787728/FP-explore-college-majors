OK let me get this straight you are charging me $100 for 4 episodes of an anime and your not even going to dub it? This show was so cute I would have hated to pay that much for it but I would have if you would atleast dubbed it! Ridiculous.... People who read this please go watch this show on crunchyroll in HD and pass up this overpriced crappy release we have to show these companies that us anime lovers don't mind spending money we just want what we pay for and for a total of close $300 you best have a dual audio option on that thing.",1449273600,2,661,3.9774436090225564
