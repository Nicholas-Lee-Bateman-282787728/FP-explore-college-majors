3447017,3,B001AD54NE,"One of those older flicks where the mouths do not match the vocalization. Color is washed out a bit.  The acting is hammed up as well. Still, very entertaining movie from the era it was made in.",1313366400,2,194,4.243243243243243
3447018,2,B001AD54NE,"1960s Italian science fiction produced extremely bizarre and diverse movies, with Primo Zeglio's ""Mission Stardust"" being one of the cheesier and more ridiculous. The story may have made more sense before it was dubbed, but I doubt it. Astronauts leave on a mission to the moon, but upon arrival find themselves cut off from communicating with Earth. The astronauts drive what looks for all the world like an extraterrestrial weinermobile around the moon looking for the plot, when they stumble on a robot, who takes them back to an alien ship commanded by the beautiful Thora (Essy Persson) assisted by cadaverous but kind Crest (John Karlsen) who is ill. The aliens are so advanced they have no knowledge of disease, so the Earth doctor makes the diagnosis: leukemia.

Because the contact with alien life is such a big discovery they have to keep it utterly confidential, and fly with the aliens back to Earth without telling anybody. (What!?!) Now if you were flying back to Earth to get the very best health care for your new alien pal, where would you go? Mombasa? That's what I thought. Apparently the leukemia specialist Dr. Frank Haggard (Stefano Sibaldi) works out of a clinic in Kenya, so they land the spacecraft 400 miles away in the middle of the desert, requiring elaborate ground transportation plans.

Meanwhile the evil Arkin (Pinkas Braun) plans to hijack the spaceship in a confusing subplot involving mineral rights and metal mining. (It's better if you don't think too hard about this.) Before it's all over with there are traitors and double-crosses everywhere (""I'm not Dr. Haggard!"") numerous fistfights, wacky weapons, robot wars, inept military leaders, and improbable events galore. My fundamental question was this: how did Arkin know that of all the diseases an alien stranded on the moon could have, that Cress would have leukemia, and would know this far enough in advance to plant a nurse saboteur in the Mombasa leukemia clinic? Why also did the astronauts need to buy a car for what was (according to the movie) a two mile drive? (I really need to follow my own advice.)

Lang Jeffries stars as Maj. Perry Rhodan, the commanding astronaut, who confirms every 1960's stereotype ever invented about the astronaut corps, eventually even winning over hard-as-nails Thora in a most predictable, yet still amusing, conclusion that everyone knew would be totally inevitable.

""Mission Stardust"" does have a few interesting features, the alien spaceships foremost among them (I think they look like giant octopi on stilts,) and of course there's the undeniable beauty of Essy Persson which helps a not insubstantial amount. The cons outweigh the pros though as the story drags, the characters are strictly two-dimensional, large swaths of the film just don't make much sense, and most annoyingly, the soundtrack features never-ending electronic grunting as background music (remember the synthesizer was new then.) If you are a B-movie fan or a fan of Italian sci-fi, ""Mission Stardust"" contains adequate amusement value for a single viewing, but for most people there are simply better options for their viewing pleasure.",1309046400,35,3148,5.118677042801556
3447019,2,B001AD54NE,"The DVD is not as good as a Rhino VHS I had.  There are a couple of trailers that are not on the VHS, but other than that and the cover there is no reason to buy this over the VHS.",1305331200,15,180,3.3902439024390243
3447020,4,B001AD54NE,"I saw this movie once as a seven year old, and it stuck with me.  I had forgotten the title until I stumbled across the picture on the cover.  Taking a chance it was the right movie, I ordered it, and bingo!  The movie I had been searching for, for years.
The soundtrack is very strange and you can't get it out of your head, particularly the opening and closing song.
Essy Persson is mesmerizing as the alien chick. She is sexy but a real leader, pre-dating the strong female roles of recent sci fi movies by decades.  The movie itself has lousy special effects, but crazy enough ideas to keep you entertained. (robots, anti gravity beams, hot secret agent chicks disguised as nurses- what more could you want?).
The DVD is a DVD-R, made per order.
Perhaps someone will release a better copy in the film's original 16:9 format, but for now this pan and scan 16mmm print will have to do.

3447025,4,B001AD54NE,"I was in my late teens when I first seen this on TV back in the seventies. I went to a Boy Scout meeting to find out most of the ""boys"" had seen this too! Of course all of our hormones were on a mountain top over Essy Persson! The story line was silly, the acting was average for its time and place in Sci-FI motion pictures. But as a boy you were not interested in all of that! Heck it was porn to us then! I had to buy it on DVD when I came out just to reflect on something over thirty five years ago. I watched it and actually appreciated the effort and creativity a low budget movie crew could put together. I am into Independent movie productions now and design sets and props on the side. I would of loved to go back in time and work on projects like this, especially for what I know today! My work on Starship 2 Rendezvous with Ramsis, which is still in post production for special effects and rendering, makes me appreciate past productions. That was an era that any finished project made its place in movie history. Today anyone can make a movie even with their cell phones but you will not find 99% of them anywhere on DVD to buy or will remember them one day in the future.",1398470400,,1184,4.107758620689655

3447029,4,B001AD54NE,"It's strange how, as an adult you process memories from your childhood. As a young child I was exposed to a myriad of Scifi, action & horror films as I stayed up late to ""keep my Father company"" as he watched films on a Friday night presented by a host called ""Deadly Earnest"".
The fond memory of this ""mystery film"" has remained with me for 44 years (having only ever watched it the one time as a five year old!) until I recently stumbled across it's path. I purchased it immediately, the Amazon experience of course being faultless as has always been the case for me.
Watching this movie again was a pleasant experience. Placed in perspective it was well made for it's time and presented some difficult concepts very well. A great moral  lesson to the story. The music soundtrack was a little corny in places but did not detract from my enjoyment.
One small negative on the packaging - the case is made of a plastic that smells so toxic it leaves you wondering if you should touch it at all!",1368057600,3,993,4.426229508196721
3447030,4,B001AD54NE,"MISSION STARDUST is a nearly incomprehensible, psychedelic sci-fi yarn. It has spaceships, killer robots, international espionage, mercenaries, double-crosses, nurses w/ machine guns, an insanely fun theme song, and a hot alien babe named Thora (Essy Persson)! I enjoyed watching this movie, even though it seemed like it was being made up, on the spot, while the cameras were rolling! Ms. Persson can abduct me anytime!...",1361664000,6,423,5.523076923076923
3447031,2,B001AD54NE,"The movie was worse than I expected... Bad video, bad acting, bad special effects were all at a level I was expecting, but it is difficulty to believe that they required 3 screenplay writers to screw-up an ok sci-fi book (at least for a book written early 60s before Apollo 11). If you haven't read the Perry Rhodan series please don't waste your money. But if you read a few of them (maybe thousands) you know you will have to check it out one day.

This review is based on the VHS version I own. I never thought it would ever make it to DVD, but it did so at some point when I have more cash I will purchase the DVD as my VCR needs to retire soon, but that is just me as I collect and read > 500 of these books...

3447032,1,B001AD54NE,"The earth sends a secret mission to the moon. It is one no one knows about except for a drug dealer. Their mission is to explore a new mineral whose density is greater than cobalt or lithium. While there, they encounter a race of beings who look like us. They have traveled 34 million light years to our moon looking for a cure for leukemia. Okay got that?

Just so happens our astronaut knows of a doctor in Africa (Sara Palin's one nation Africa.) who is working on a leukemia serum so our guys along with sexy alien Thora (Essy Persson) head there.

This was apparently made during an era where anything with a sci-fi label on it sold to the masses no matter how bad the quality or plot...sort of like zombie and vampire films of today...just add ""Lincoln"" to it. The film is so poorly done which means it has camp value, hence the many 5-star reviews. Special effects were terrible. The science was so bad, it made ""Prometheus"" look like a documentary.

Some panoramic views and conversations between peoples become meaningless.  Still waiting for restored version.",1342310400,3,408,4.855072463768116
3447036,3,B001AD54NE,"Throughout my high school years I read the American translations of the Perry Rhodan series in paperback editions as presented by Forrest J. Ackerman and his wife Wendy.  I loved this epic space opera and couldn't wait until the next edition came out.  In the back pages of the books there were several articles on this movie and I longed to see it.  I finally caught it on late night TV and loved it.  Eventually I purchased a copy of it on VSH for my SF movie collection.

Loosely based on the first two novel in the series Mission Stardust (it is also known by several other titles) is a fun film for the not too demanding.  Lang Jefferies does bring space hero Perry Rhodan (called Rodan in this film) to life in a manner that should not make too many fans of the series angry.  But no one who have ever read any of the books should have a problem with the ultra sexy Essy Parsons as the alien Thora.

As I said before the plot of the film roughly follows that of the first 2 books in the series retelling how American astronaut and the crew of the spaceship Stardust crash land on the moon and meet up with strandard alien explores Thora and Krest (or Crest) who is dying from cancer.  Rhodan, Thora, Krest and company travel back to earth in the giant alien life space boat to get a cure for cancer.  At this point a sub plot not found in the books is introduced involving international spies and gangster who are trying to gain control of the gold rights that are to be found on the moon.

Even with the bad dubbing and even worst special effects Mission Stardust does manage in its own crude way to capture some of the charm of the eary Rhodan stories.  No this film isn't for every one but for those who are not so jaded that they can sit back and enjoy some sixties pop then Mission Stardust is a film for you.",1338768000,13,1820,4.243478260869566
3447037,3,B001AD54NE,"This is the only movie based on Perry Rhodan. Perry had a paperback  series of books in the 60s and 70s. They were more adveture in space than science fiction but they were popular. This movie stars Lang Jeffries an American actor in the lead role. He does well and carries the proper swagger the role needed. The movie is must see for anyone into the sixties swinging era as it was filmed at that time. The budget was sparse but the model work is good.
The film is worth the look for the film it self. The transfer and copy it was made from were not of the best qualty and I hope smeone in the futuire will do a really good transfer.",1332547200,5,634,4.112903225806452
3447038,5,B001AD54NE,"This is an obscure Italian scifi movie that is really quite enjoyable. The special effects are good for there time and the film's budget. The spaceship is really cool looking.

8276722,1,B001AD54NE,"I fell in love with this silly spaghetti SF movie after watching it on youtube. A silly plot, dripping with 60's Euro-swank, over the top score, and the gorgeous Essy Persson. Just my cup of tea. I wanted a DVD for the collection. Unfortunately, this Sinister Cinema DVD transfer is horrible. HOR-RI-BLE.

Bad contrast, almost totally washed out color, low res, muddled sound. MUCH worse than what's on youtube. Per IMDB the aspect ratio was 2.35:1, but this DVD is pan & scan so forget seeing it in wide screen. This looks like the kind of DVD you'd end up with if your dad duped it off VHS in his combo VHS/DVDR box, complete with ultra-primitive menu. The final insult is the ""SC"" bug burned into the corner of the frame.

Most Perry Rhodan fans pretend to deny the existence of this movie because it's so bad, but I just had to see for myself. As a sci-fi movie, I don't think it would  even earn a ""class-b"" designation. The special effects are almost hard to watch, they're so cheesy.  The movie, which is based on  ""Operation Stardust"", the first installment of the Perry Rhodan series, has a sub plot not present in the actual book involving an international mobster. Younger viewers may not care for a film that is the product of mid 1960's culture and attitudes as there is plenty to rile those who adhere to political correctness.
