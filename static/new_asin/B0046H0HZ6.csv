4268979,5,B0046H0HZ6,A great story for the crime novel enthusiast. I bought the Swedish lanaguage editions of the book and the DVD for language proficiency maintenance.,1284854400,,147,5.166666666666667
4268980,5,B0046H0HZ6,I was able to watch this movie over my computer's dvd rom even though it uses the PAL format.  I was very pleased to be able to see the final segment of the trilogy by Stieg Larsson.,1283558400,7,182,3.918918918918919
4268981,4,B0046H0HZ6,"""The Girl Who Kicked A Hornet's Nest"" is really more like ""The Girl Who Played With Fire Part II"" -- this movie begins mere minutes after the end of the previous one, and everything stems from the film before it. The third and final film adapted from Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is a taut, unnerving exploration of a government cover-up -- with the titular ""girl"" as their victim.

Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) has been shot in the head, and is rushed to a hospital for surgery -- the same hospital as her evil father Zalachenko. And since she's still being framed for murder,  Mikael (Michael Nyqvist) devotes the forthcoming issue of ""Millennium"" to clearing her name and revealing the government's dirty secrets (including how they had her institutionalized as a kid).

But when Zalachenko threatens to rat them out, the ""Section"" sends an assassin to shoot him. Unfortunately, this group also wants want to punish Lisbeth by sticking her in another mental home, and the pedophile director Teleborian is all too happy to lock her up. The best chance Lisbeth has is to send her own ""autobiograpy"" to Mikael.

It's not a whodunnit, and it's not a straight thriller. ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" is a slow-moving, complex affair, centering on powerful men who try to crush women who defy them, and a system filled with in corrupt muck, cruelty and murder. It's part legal drama, part conspiracy story, and part bloody thriller.

And while not as harrowing as the movies before it, this movie is a bleak tangled web of threats, evidence,stalkings, and the occasional gory death (along with the hysteria that accompanies them). As the story goes on, it tauter and frightening, buoyed up by Lisbeth's impassive defiance (she walks into her own trial in full goth-punk regalia!).

The one flaw? The last fifteen minutes feel disconnected from the rest of the film, and the last scene feels... anticlimactic, and vaguely unfinished. Then again, since Larsson intended to write ten books, perhaps the ""unfinished"" flavor is inevitable.

Rapace is silent for long stretches of the story, and her impassive face, deep eyes and leashed energy make her a presence even when she doesn't speak. Her Lisbeth is full of defiance against the world, and it can only be seen through her dress and her silence. Nyqvist is good but rather overshadowed by Rapace; Anders Ahlbom is wonderfully vile as Teleborian --it's INCREDIBLY satisfying to see the pedophile get torn apart.

""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest"" ends on a ""to be continued"" note that will never be continued, but it's a satisfying end to the tale of Lisbeth Salander.",1279411200,123,2641,4.9324324324324325

4268983,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Noomi Rapace, Michael Nyqvist and Lena Endre are the MILLENNIUM trilogy dream-team. Noomi's performance as Lisbeth Salander is the definitive one, no matter how many actresses will come after her. Niels Arden Oplev's first film, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, is my favorite, but HORNET'S NEST is a fine ending to all three Swedish films. This is a Swedish story, written by a Swede, set in Sweden, about Swedish characters: It only makes sense that it be portrayed by Swedish actors. In Swedish with English Subtitles.",1517184000,,521,5.0
4268984,5,B0046H0HZ6,Great movie series.,1516579200,,19,5.666666666666667
4268985,4,B0046H0HZ6,"I wasn't terribly thrilled with the first two films of the trilogy. There were some intense parts, but other parts that dragged on. Too many storylines were introduced while others were not wrapped up. I still was invested enough in the series to watch the third. This one is actually pretty solid, if a bit lengthy. It is also a bit less ""rapey"" than the first two. I still have some issues with the plot, and I hated the ending scene in the brickyard, but this one (as well as the first two) were beautifully shot and the acting is great. Noomi Rapace is especially brilliant playing a complex and troubled character. I was relieved that this third film followed the scandals and cover-ups of those in charge, rather than the previous theme that all men are the worst filth on the planet and do whatever they want. It is still quite prevalent in this one but slightly more subtle.",1513900800,,882,4.51875

4268987,5,B0046H0HZ6,"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest is a 2010 Swedish murder mystery and thriller, which is a film adaptation of the novel by the same name, that was written by the acclaimed Swedish journalist and author, the late Stieg Larsson. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest is the third and last novel in the iconic Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy, and this movie represents the third and final film adaptation of the novels of the Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy. Its story line begins with the hospitalization of Lisbeth Salander, the eccentric punk programmer and computer genius, after she was shot and severely wounded by her evil and nefarious father. Of course, Lisbeth Salander is in extreme danger as long as she remains in the hospital, as her father has a contingent of ruthless henchmen who are working furiously to silence her permanently. From her hospital bed, she deploys her substantial computer skills to facilitate the mission of investigative journalist Mikael Blomqvist to expose the wide-ranging criminal enterprise of her father, as well as a related conspiracy involving several high-ranking government officials and security service agents. Ultimately, Lisbeth Salander has her day in court, and the ensuing murder trial commences, with damaging testimony regarding her purported volatile and violent behavior. As would be expected in a Lisbeth Salander murder trial, the proceedings are confrontational and contentious, and the stunning verdict is delivered to a courtroom that is still reeling from the shocking witness testimony. Once again, the performances of the lead actors, Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist, are absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest is a decidedly intriguing, suspenseful, and captivating murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1507248000,,2127,5.429003021148036

4268990,5,B0046H0HZ6,"love this movie. First in a series of three. Even though it is in Swedish, it is engrossing.  You can watch a dubbed English version, but I'd rather watch it in the original Swedish with subtitles. It is a mystery disguised as a political thriller. Some harsh scenery in it not suitable for younger viewers. Amazing scenery, great plot. The first time I watched this I stayed up very late to see the ending and lost sleep I needed for work.

4269036,3,B0046H0HZ6,"Noomi Rapace of course is astonishing in this, her third time up as the tormented Swedish girl.  And the original novel from whence it stems has plenty of plot, twists and turns to satisfy any mystery buff.
  I saw the version with sub-titles rather than the dubbed in version.  I think I should have gone the other way.  Some of the fine detail seems to have passed me by.  And the darn thing, in true Swedish film tradition,  has stretches of what can only be called boredom.  I take it as true that Swedes do not much use their facial muscles to exhibit emotion but not to linger over a face simply existing.  Ditto for over extended shots of the countryside.  The director could have chopped 30 minutes out of the movie without hurting any thing.
  Even with those criticisms, this is an important film that deserves our time and attention.",1468713600,,844,4.516556291390729

The Swedish movie series (which I've seen 3x) is a lot of fun to watch, and Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth Salander well. My only concern was the pace, which is much more in keeping with Swedish audiences probably than American ones. It's extreeeeeemely slow and at times labored feeling, and the music is cheesy and repetitive. The opening sequence of paintings, while creative and interesting as an idea, feels like a maudlin illustration project I might have come up with in my sophomore year of art school. Overall, yes, watch it. It's fun... a little campy and over the top at times, definitely very European in its pace and characterizations, but great entertainment.",1454976000,,763,5.063492063492063

The plot has degenerated into a standard ""reporter stumbles across secret evil government conspiracy"" and has none of the freshness displayed in the original ""Dragon Tattoo"". Probably worth watching, but not great.",1440201600,,350,5.157894736842105

It is also unusual to find women with Salender's talents, who are able to exploit the shortfalls.",1440028800,,192,5.193548387096774
4269201,5,B0046H0HZ6,Great trilogy. Although it got slightly Hollywoodish toward the end had a rawness and grittiness that lent a realism lacking in many American films.,1440028800,,148,5.208333333333333

4269207,4,B0046H0HZ6,Great series.  I had to watch the conclusion.  I did not know anything previously about this series of books / movies and I really enjoyed them.  European murder / mystery / suspense movies are much different than American made movies but not in a bad way.  I can also say it was interesting getting a small glimpse of foreign culture and scenes.,1438992000,,346,4.532258064516129
4269208,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Intense, suspenseful, well acted...I could watch this movie over and over again and still see and hear new things.  I don't normally like to watch movies with subtitles (whether I speak the native language or not)...but I don't speak Swedish, so I can't believe I enjoyed it so much even with subtitles!  I definitely recommend seeing the previous film ""The Girl who Played with Fire"" before this one.  You don't have to watch the first of the three ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" to enjoy or understand the second two.  For those that read the books, the movies are less detailed, which in my opinion is a good idea...couldn't take all the detail in a movie!  The basic plot is faithful to the books, and the acting and cast are perfect!  note:  the cinematography is a little dark...and that takes a while to get used to, but then later on you understand why.",1438992000,,864,4.571428571428571
4269209,5,B0046H0HZ6,"This is the Swedish version, with subtitles.  We thoroughly enjoyed it, and the other two installments.  We don't have an issue watching movies with subtitles.  This extended version follows the book very closely which makes a nice change.  The portrayal of Lisbeth rang true with the books and the rest of the characters also seemed very plausible, nice to see 'ordinary' looking people cast rather than the often plastic and incredibly beautiful and slim Hollywood types, these actors seemed much more like real life people.  The movie is long, 3 hours, but can easily be watched in two sittings as these films were obviously originally aired as a 6 part series, so there is a definate break after 1.5 hours before the next episode begins.  We are starting to watch more and more European programming as they seem more 'real' than the stuff that comes out of Hollywood where everyone is perfect looking and clean and shiny, real life is not like that and becomes very irritating after a while.",1438905600,2,995,4.823529411764706

Also, the first film had a more Swedish feel to me.  However,  I will view this trilogy again whenever I want to get in touch with my fierce female self and remind myself that no matter how old and wise I get, I still find myself having to stand up to men who are less than I am but who are in positions of authority simply because they are male.

4269230,5,B0046H0HZ6,I think the Swedish versions of the trilogy are much better than the Daniel Craig version because they cover the whole book. Feature films try to squeeze a lot in two hours and the editing tends to loose something but these are wonderful. They are subtitled and each movie is 3 hours. I hardly feel like I am reading.

count how often I've re-watched the three movies. Great stuff - great stories - great characters. Noomi Rapace was
simply brilliant as Lizbeth - got the character just perfect. I highly recommend this trilogy, and if you are a true

4269291,3,B0046H0HZ6,"I liked this movie best of the three scandinavian productions. The first two seemed stilted, with scenes more like camera shots that a continuous movie story. The best movie production by far was the first book by the American production company that I first saw on TV. That got me interested in the author and reading the trilogy. The trilogy novels were the best, as they generally are for me, although the movies were pretty true to the books.

Amazing writing. What a shame that Larsson died of a heart attack at less than 50 years old right after finishing the third book of the trilogy. I thougth it might have actually been a hit by trafficing interests. Then I conjectured that the writing interested him so much, like it did me, that he didn't take care of himself. I read that between his day job and writng the trilogy he worked over 20 hours a day. His death was shocking and felt like a loss in the family. I was looking forward to more great writing, and then he was gone. I still feel a void in my life for him. Such a gifted writer and researcher, with a deep, heart felt social conscious.

May he rest in peace.",1431302400,,1128,4.366666666666666

It is a brutal film no doubt but it is also a film about overcoming and persevering the harsh realities of the world. Of course it is a film and it is meant to also be entertaining so some suspension of belief is required but the story is a very good one.

Sad there will be no more great stories from this author who died shortly after completing this trilogy.,1428451200,,269,4.760869565217392

4269305,4,B0046H0HZ6,"It was hard to decide 4 or 5 stars, because I've liked the whole series.  This movie, as well as its predecessor, is faithful to the book but with two lapses in the story.  The romance between Michael and Erika is downplayed in this movie relative to the book.  Also, the falling out between Michael and Lisbeth is not portayed in these movies, but rather the Lisbeth character seems to be even more withdrawn than in the book.  Should a movie be faithful to the book on which it's based?  Not necessarily, but the romance between Lisbeth and Michael, which Lisbeth very much wanted and was a large theme in the book, is missing in these movies.  But I'd watch it again, especially for the dramatic courtroom scene near the end.",1428105600,,728,4.519083969465649
4269306,3,B0046H0HZ6,"The weakest of the three Millennium movies. The plot is very much a kind of legal procedural and the action is much slower than in the first two movies. It's a coda to the entire series and wraps everything up, but feels almost superfluous. Not really a fault of the movie's makers, as much as Stieg. But it just didn't seem very organic and a little forced with the whole rogue government-group-conspiracy angle.",1428019200,,413,4.671232876712328

4269324,2,B0046H0HZ6,"I know I'm swimming against the tide by not liking this movie, but for me, it was not anywhere near as good as the first two installments in the Millenium Trilogy.  In the first two movies (""Dragon Tattoo"" and ""Played with Fire,"" there was action and drama and a sense of danger.  As for ""Hornet's Nest""...

<spoilers>

...they could have just as easily titled it ""The Girl Who Sat in Her Hospital Bed and Holding Cell While a Group of Not So Interesting Journalists Fought to Save Her from the Machinations of a Bunch of Old Spies Who Belonged in a Retirement Home.""

That really sums the movie up in a nutshell.  It moves at a glacial pace and the fascinating character of Lisabeth Salander is very much on the periphery of the ""action"" (if the bureaucratic and legal wrangling over her fate can really be called ""action"").

Another thing...it's probably because I view this from an American perspective, but I had a hard time taking the idea of an evil cabal in the Swedish version of the FBI committing murders and all kinds of dark deeds seriously.  The Russians?  Sure!  But the Swedes?  No way!  But then I didn't write the story, Stieg Larson did and he was pretty far left and people on the political extremes who live in democracies sometimes have visions of their countries' intelligence services that would be more accurate if they were of entities like the Stasi, KGB, and Gestapo.

<spoilers end>

So I wound up giving ""the Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" two stars and will end here with the fervent hope that when the fourth novel gets released (supposedly in late 2015), they make a better movie about it than this one.",1421712000,,1639,4.587628865979381

4269336,4,B0046H0HZ6,"A return to form after ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" fell into a bit of 'middle part of a trilogy disease'; lots of exposition and setting up for the last part, together with a feeling of marking time, that nothing can really get too resolved. Consequently both the sense of danger, and emotional impact were lower, even though there was a lot more running around, shooting, etc. It felt more like a Hollywood action film.

But here we get back into deeper themes, back into Lisbeth Sander's head. There's less action, but more psychology and complex behavior, and that's where the strength of the trilogy lies. There are fight scenes, sure, but the most intense scenes are the film's courtroom battles, and it's almost as scary to think that Lisbeth may self-destruct, as that others may destroy her.

Noomi Rapace does her best work of the trilogy here. We get Lisbeth's stone exterior, but there are always just enough hints of the damaged little girl she was to keep her heartbreaking. Her long but filled silences, and minimal dialogue betray how painful it is for her to even try to trust other human beings. The series themes about the damage that men do to women comes back to the forefront, and we're less in a thriller than a character study with thrills.

I still think the first film, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" felt the most gritty and real. The scope of the bad guys was less theatrical, the conspiracies more believable because they're more limited, less grandiose. But as a conclusion to the three act opera, this is pretty damn solid, and certainly stuck with me in the days after I saw it.",1418169600,,1616,4.643356643356643

4269399,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Not very likely to be happening in Sweden, at least as I understand Sweden, but a plausible scenario for a NATO member country.  Thoughtful, bold and entertaining.",1394323200,,163,5.037037037037037
4269400,5,B0046H0HZ6,This was a very good movie and it ends the trilogy about Lisbeth Salander and I hope that there would be a four book.,1393804800,,117,3.9166666666666665

4269402,4,B0046H0HZ6,Very good film Noomi Rapace is excellent in this movie although the dubbing could have been done a little better,1393804800,,112,4.65
4269403,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Whenever you have read the book before you see the movie, you are wary.  I was pleased with the adaptation AND with the acting.  If you liked the Larsen books, you will enjoy the movies.

Now, if you have NOT read the books, of course some of the details are lost.  The movie still probably works well even without these details.",1393718400,,329,4.344262295081967
4269404,4,B0046H0HZ6,a must see! if you like suspense and mystery this series is for you. All 3 parts are well done.,1393718400,,95,3.8
4269405,4,B0046H0HZ6,"I rated this 4 stars because it's a really good movie. However, I did not watch this on Amazon prime. I started to but the dubbing was driving me up the wall. I stopped just a few minutes into it and a few days later, I borrowed it from a friend on disc and watched the subtitled version. I almost rated this one star because of that but it didn't seem fair since Amazon lumps all the versions (dvd, blu-ray, steaming, etc.) together.",1393718400,,434,4.240963855421687
4269406,4,B0046H0HZ6,Continues the whodunit plot of the girl with the Dragon tattoo. The girl who played with fire is the second movie of the trilogy and is very very well done. The final movie the girl who kicked the hornets nest is the climax of the whole story of the trilogy and is excellent.,1393632000,,275,4.2075471698113205
4269407,4,B0046H0HZ6,And an even better book. I liked the whole trilogy. Too bad it will stay a trilogy...ja ja ja ja,1393372800,,96,3.85
4269408,5,B0046H0HZ6,I have watched all three shows and loved all of them. Loved the suspense about the missing girl and all of the characters.,1393200000,,122,4.3478260869565215
4269409,5,B0046H0HZ6,The English dubbed version makes it much easier to pay attention to the action on the screen.  A great conclusion to the trilogy!,1393113600,,129,4.608695652173913
4269410,3,B0046H0HZ6,Great story. Book was better. The first film in Swedish had English subtitles and I remember watching it as though they were speaking English.  The dubbing makes you feel at times like you're watching an old Kung fu movie,1393113600,,221,4.666666666666667
4269411,4,B0046H0HZ6,"After watching ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" I was some what reluctant to watch this movie. However it was less violent, except for some of the flashbacks, but less shocking the second time around. You can't help but get emotionally involved with this girl and love that she finally gets her freedom from the system, and those responsible for her abuse were ""outed"" and punished. The dubbing in English was very well done.",1393027200,,426,4.77027027027027
4269412,2,B0046H0HZ6,"Though it does inform us of ""what happened next"" it falls far short of the edgy quality suspense movie that "" the girl with the dragon tattoo"" movie. It was a poor excuse to get more money out of a highly expectant audience. Barely worth the time to watch.",1393027200,,256,4.244897959183674
4269413,5,B0046H0HZ6,"This book was hard to put down. Well-written, excellent plot line, characters that get you involved. The entire series is one of my favorites. It's easy to skip over the nasty parts without losing the story line.",1392940800,,212,4.756756756756757
4269414,2,B0046H0HZ6,Probably lost 20 percent of the  through terrible cutting  and the dubbing was out of sync with the lips and the subtitles. Yikes!,1392854400,,130,4.608695652173913
4269415,5,B0046H0HZ6,I totally enjoyed this it goes right along with book so it was very enjoyable to me. If you have read the series you will enjoy this and be looking for more.,1392768000,,157,3.9375

4269417,5,B0046H0HZ6,"A great finale to the series, but this recording has left out a third of the priginal film which I've seen on pay-per-view. As such, I am very disappointed. I'll keep this one for my collection, but will hope to find the complete version one day.",1392508800,,246,4.369565217391305
4269418,5,B0046H0HZ6,We really enjoyed this trilogy.  The acting was wonderful.  Ending leaves you with hope for healing.  We might need to watch it all over.,1392422400,,137,4.625
4269419,5,B0046H0HZ6,This movie keeps one on the edge of your seat. It is very violent and very graffic. I wish there  more but the author died.,1392422400,,123,3.92
4269420,2,B0046H0HZ6,I was not impressed with the acting.  I expected more from the movie based on such a exciting and compelling book.,1392249600,,114,4.428571428571429
4269421,1,B0046H0HZ6,Cheap continuation from Girl with Dragon Tattoo! I wouldn't recommend as you will be disappointed! Same as the girl who played with fire,1392163200,,136,4.956521739130435
4269422,4,B0046H0HZ6,"As is often the case, the book was better than the movie.  Part of the reason is that much of the book was left out of the movie..another part was the fact that it was dubbed in English. I would prefer sub-titles",1392076800,,212,4.0476190476190474
4269423,5,B0046H0HZ6,Overall the actors felt real as opposed to the American version where the actors are selected on box office appeal.,1391990400,,115,4.8
4269424,5,B0046H0HZ6,I fully recommend the extended version with subtitles.  It fully did justice the the Larrsen classics staying true to the story,1391990400,,127,5.0476190476190474
4269425,5,B0046H0HZ6,Movie is great.  Didn't think I would like 'English Dubbed' movies but this one is top notch.  I must watch for those that loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.,1391904000,,161,4.333333333333333
4269426,1,B0046H0HZ6,Read the book series and liked it in spite of all the Swedish references being difficult to read. The picture was mostly fast forward.,1391817600,,134,4.625
4269427,5,B0046H0HZ6,"If you have read the book, this ""mini-series"" follows the book well and re-creates the details in the book without leaving out the details.
The English Dubbed version was easy to watch for me (easier than reading the English subtitles).",1391817600,,236,4.925
4269428,3,B0046H0HZ6,I saw the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first and loved it.  This seemed like a good sequel but I have to admit I liked the actors/actresses in the Dragon so much better.,1391817600,,168,4.090909090909091
4269429,5,B0046H0HZ6,I read all three books and was surprised that someone had made all 3 into movies (US only did one). All three of these movies were excellent and the dubbing was not a problem. If it were not for my Prime membership I would not have know that this movie existed.,1391817600,,261,4.137254901960785
4269430,5,B0046H0HZ6,It was a great way to end the series and answer a lot of questions.  It is a shame that the author has passed away.,1391731200,,115,3.6
4269431,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Not the standard movie, but I enjoyed as I read all three books and wanted to see the movies
to see if they coincided.  I would recommend, especially if you have read the books.",1391731200,,177,4.205882352941177
4269432,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Not sure what's taking so long for the American version, but the Dutch version is fantastic.  Loved the books and the movie did a great job of incorporating important aspects of the story line.",1391644800,,193,4.676470588235294
4269433,3,B0046H0HZ6,I loved The first movie in this series - didn't think this one lived up to it. To understand this one you would have to see the first one.,1391644800,,138,3.793103448275862
4269434,5,B0046H0HZ6,Great plot and performance. The story really draws you in. Youv'e got to watch the entire triology; you won't be disappointed.,1391644800,,126,5.0476190476190474
4269435,4,B0046H0HZ6,Enjoyed the entire trilogy.  What a shame this author is no longer with us. Now I should read the books!,1391644800,,104,4.2
4269436,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Part of what makes this whole Lisbeth Salander saga so engaging is that she's so smart and resourceful. I know some people have criticized it for not being believable because of the grim situations she seems always to fight her way out of, but for me that's what I loved. It's a nice break from the ""woman as victim"" theme. And I've seen both the subtitled version as well as the English dubbed version, and I prefer the dubbed version. It's well done and when I want to watch a movie, I want to watch a movie...You know what I mean? Reading is a different thing all together and I love to read, but not on the screen. I admit I like to multi-task a bit...knit or sew on a button or go into the next room to get a drink, all while being able to follow the movie because I can hear what's going on. Not possible with subtitles.",1391558400,,826,4.16875
4269437,5,B0046H0HZ6,You need to put more of these types of movies on.  I like Noomi Rapace more of her movies would be great.,1391558400,,105,3.772727272727273
4269438,5,B0046H0HZ6,Really enjoyed these original books and movies is very very good. I highly recommend these three books and movies to watch.,1391472000,,123,4.904761904761905

4269440,1,B0046H0HZ6,"Have not seen any in this series yet. Not crazy about dubbing movies, but if subtitled is going to be the only way to see all 3 in this series, guess I will see none. Bummer.",1391385600,,174,3.861111111111111
4269441,4,B0046H0HZ6,"unique
Sometimes difficult to stay up with the reading of the English subtitles.
Well written mystery, mostly good acting but sometimes difficult to tell as the language didn't synch
I would recommend it to those who can handle rape violence scene with the victim winning the final round",1391299200,,287,5.0
4269442,5,B0046H0HZ6,"I absolutely loved this series.  Perhaps it is one of my favorites of all time.  After reading the books, I found this series, which is so much better than just about anything we produce here. It is dark, violent and difficult to watch at times.  Noomi Rapace is fantastic. I love Michael Nyvist. I have actually watched it several times, and then moved on to other Swedish crime series (like Wallander, and several others). The scenery is spectacular. One of the things I really enjoy is that the actors are all generally very ordinary looking, as opposed to American films and tv where everyone looks like a supermodel. This film is engrossing. The court room scenes are great. Overall, highly highly recommended.",1391299200,,715,4.844262295081967
4269443,3,B0046H0HZ6,"I'm going to have to watch the original version with subtitles before I can accurately rate this show.  I don't know if my objections are based on bad translations or on a simple lack of logic in the story telling. One of the main features that made the first two movies so good is that the actions of all of the characters made sense in their own twisted way.  In this film, too many of the characters did things that were inconsistent with their own characters or didn't even make sense within the context of the film.  Noonan was fantastic as always.",1391040000,,553,4.401960784313726

4269452,1,B0046H0HZ6,I chose that rating because we couldn't even watch the full picture.  For one reason or another a sign came on the screen saying the film couldn't continue and suggested we try later.  Our watching time was just wasted.,1390867200,,219,4.589743589743589
4269453,4,B0046H0HZ6,Follow up from the Girl with the dragon tattoo... It clears up what this girls life was like and why she is the way she is. She is a very smart and tough girl to survive what she has in her life.,1390867200,,195,3.6666666666666665
4269454,4,B0046H0HZ6,I loved this movie but it endedanti  sort of anti climatic. What I did love about it is even though it was the end of a trilogy it left me wondering what was next for her in life since she took care of all her enemys,1390867200,,216,3.6956521739130435

4269456,5,B0046H0HZ6,"This was a great book and it was very gratifying to see that the film version stuck to the story line and corners weren't cut.  In short, this is a movie to be proud of in the making.  A fabulous job was done with the casting dialogue and action.",1390262400,,246,4.0
4269457,5,B0046H0HZ6,"I love the atmosphere of Europe, the Swedish language and style. The stories are not so understandably easy, and there is no ""happy ending"" as in Hollywood have to be. I recommend!",1390176000,,180,4.65625
4269458,5,B0046H0HZ6,Great finale in this 3 part series.  Loved every minute of it.  Little graphic at times but that's reality.  Great continuity and super story line.,1390176000,,147,4.8

Not always easy to follow or watch, it is a grand work of plot development, acting and set designs.  The casting crew did their homework to bring exactly the blend of physical features, personalities and attitudes to bring the original book to life on the large screen.  I enjoyed this CC version much better than the later dubbed in English version.  For those who can think out of the box, go for it on streaming or add it to you CD library.",1389398400,,582,4.514285714285714

Was very sad to hear of his death. It is so much better than the English version which seems to have been made in a hurry. Not nearly as much depth as this version.

4269473,3,B0046H0HZ6,this movie was just average. I didn't think it flowed well and was generally disappointed. The first movie in this series was much better both plot and acting.,1389139200,,159,4.714285714285714

4269487,5,B0046H0HZ6,"This is what movies are lacking nowadays. A good plot, beginning, middle and a good ending. Kept me in suspense throughout the movie.

4269489,4,B0046H0HZ6,"The movie is great and closely following the book although there are some bits are missing, but it is normal because of the time constraints. However, if you haven't read the book yet, you will probably won't remember all the characters and you will definitely won't understant the personalities of the characters. So, read the book first...",1388793600,,341,5.0
4269490,3,B0046H0HZ6,Not as good as the first movie (US version).  But worth watching.  Sort of a let down after all the action in # 1 & 2.  I would recommend only to people who have read all 3 books and are solid fans of the series.,1388793600,,212,3.6666666666666665

I sympathize with the plot idea and the main characters, but I can't watch any more of this - it's crossed the line into bad voyeurism.
BTW, dubbing this (and almost every) film is a bad idea.  If you think subtitles are more distracting, we're on different astral planes.",1388793600,,439,4.2926829268292686

4269498,3,B0046H0HZ6,I have seen the subtitled version as well and prefer it.  The actor overdubs are discontinuous with the emotional impact of the originals.

The acting was superior and the story line was truthful of what our children go through with the system we have in all countries.  Doctors, Lawyers, Guardians, Parents, Social Workers, Police, Government cover-up and the Children who suffer because to the Physical Abuse as well as Sexual Abuse never ever get over the trauma they go through.  We live the our torture over and over, again and again in nightmares, thoughts that just pop-up when something reminds of what happened to us.  I do truly wish more people would watch this series of movies and also read the books they are our world and we all need to be responsible for what is occurring to our children daily.

4269549,5,B0046H0HZ6,"The Swedish language film, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Extended Edition, is one of those rare masterpieces in movie making. This movie is action-packed, emotional, engrossing, frightening, highly entertaining, intelligent, intense, pleasing, riveting, suspenseful, and very satisfying. The movie grabs the audience and does not let go during the entire ride. The acting, cinematography, direction, plot, and script are OUTSTANDING!!! The highly charged and incendiary performance of Swedish actor Noomi Rapace has amazing depth and is a thunderbolt, a volcano, a thing of beauty!

The original version of the film The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Extended Edition is a Swedish made, Swedish language movie with English subtitles. This exceptional film towers over the offal and excrement that commonly comes from the body of modern-day corporate Hollywood. I think that the original Swedish language version of this movie with English subtitles is vastly superior to the dubbed version in which 3rd-parties lip-synch in English over the original Swedish language dialog.

This extended edition of the film is available in Amazon Instant Videos in the Swedish language version with English subtitles. The extended edition of the film is available in the Amazon Prime Videos library in the Swedish language version with English subtitles. The film also is available in Amazon Instant Videos and in Amazon Prime Videos with English language dubbing which replaces the Swedish language dialog. The other two films in the trilogy also are available in either the Swedish language version with English subtitles or with English language dubbing over the Swedish language dialog: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Extended Edition and The Girl Who Played with Fire: Extended Edition.

In the Amazon Instant Videos and Amazon Prime Videos libraries if you want to watch all three films in the Swedish language extended edition versions with English subtitles, don't stop looking when you find the dubbed-in-English versions. Keep going with your search until you come to the Swedish language versions with English subtitles. The Swedish language versions with English subtitles are in the Amazon Instant Videos library and the Amazon Prime Videos library.

This film includes violence that contrasts the ugly dark side of human nature with the best of human nature, which the film abundantly projects. The perceptive viewer can see, hear, feel, and can almost taste and smell the brutality, fear, pain, gentleness, pleasure, and beauty of the human experience in this exceptional film. It is an emotional, intellectual, spiritual, and cinematic achievement that left me yearning for more after the end of the film.

The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Extended Edition is the third and last film in a trilogy of three inter-connected films. To enjoy best all three films, I highly recommend that the viewer watch in the following chronological sequence the Swedish extended edition of each film in the Swedish language version with English subtitles:

(1) The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Extended Edition (3 hours 7 minutes, 2011 film)
(2) The Girl Who Played with Fire: Extended Edition (3 hours 7 minutes, 2011 film)
(3) The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Extended Edition (3 hours 6 minutes, 2011 film)

The original release date of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was in 2009. It is a Swedish film in the Swedish language. The length of the film is 2 hours 33 minutes. The cast includes Swedish actors Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist. I have never watched this original 2-hr 33-min film, but I am certain that it too rates 5 Stars because I have seen the 3-hr 7-min extended edition, which includes all of the content of this original 2-hr 33-min film.

I watched the Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (English language, 2011 film) starring Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig when in 2011 it first came out in theaters in the USA. Its length is 2 hours 39 minutes. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film and is almost as exceptional as the original Swedish version of the film. Without hesitation, I give it 5 Stars, too.

A few months after I watched the Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I watched online the Swedish language version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with English subtitles in the 3-hr 7-min extended edition, which came out in 2011. This film includes Swedish actors Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist, who also have the starring roles in the other two Swedish films in the trilogy: The Girl Who Played with Fire: Extended Edition (and standard edition) and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Extended Edition (and standard edition).

Both the Swedish and Hollywood versions of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo are superb films, but I like the Swedish film more than the Hollywood version in part because of the remarkable performances of the cast including Swedish actors Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist and an outstanding supporting cast.",1382054400,,5019,5.117216117216117
4269550,5,B0046H0HZ6,Great trilogy. It would of been excellent if Daniel Craig was on the other movies of the trilogy as the first one.,1381968000,,114,4.2272727272727275
4269551,5,B0046H0HZ6,"I was skeptical about this movie, heard so much about it that I was sure it was going to be a let down.  I was wrong, hence the 'kick me'.  This was amazing, the actor, Ms. Rapace, captured the essence of a girl done wrong, and her strength is unsurmountable.  The subtitles were not a problem for me, in fact I like to read and I found the grove within the first five minutes.  THE AMERICAN VERSION DOES NOT COMPARE, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN STAND AGAINST THE SWEDISH ORIGINAL. Some times the Academy misunderstands or is not watching films.  The American version loses the cinematography, and cannot capture Lisbeth Sanders character-yes, both were watched and compared.  The Swedish version captures and shows the violence more than the American version, which surprised me.  Was it because a woman is committing violent act?  I admit this is a trilogy, which can wear a person thin, but no one says you have to watch all three.  But I must admit, the second one is worth it--with subtitles.  When the third came, it was dubbed--and it was not taken seriously.  Let us die-hards read, some of find enjoyment in it, and character inflection is not lost.  Thank you Steig Larsson for a wonderful series.",1381622400,,1210,4.629107981220657

4269556,4,B0046H0HZ6,It was cool... but long!  And back to subtitles for this one.  It was satisfying getting everything tied up... but I don't know... it just didn't have quite the same thrill as the first 2.,1380758400,,188,4.3428571428571425

4269564,5,B0046H0HZ6,"This movie deserves a 5 star rating and I would give it more if that was possible.  This is the third and final installment from Stieg Larsson's book trilogy.  I have now watched all 3 of these films at least 10 times.  There continue to be many twists and turns which will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The more the main character, Lisbeth, endures, the stronger she seems to get and this is even reflected in her appearance.  While Lisbeth has much to endure physically and emotionally in this final installment, the male lead character, Mikail, is working in the background putting the final pieces together in order to help Lisbeth.  The screenwriting is outstanding, and the cast was well chosen from the beginning - The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  I'm saddened that this trilogy has come to an end.  This movie, along with the first two installments, have made it on my personal top 10 list of the best movies I've ever seen, including To Kill A Mocking Bird and that says a lot.",1379030400,,993,4.5083798882681565

I was only disappointed in the fact I could only find the English dubbed version and not the subtitled version, as the different voices threw me off.

4269580,4,B0046H0HZ6,"If you are a fan of the three mystery books in the ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" series, you will enjoy the this movie adaption of the final book of the series. The books have masterfully written plots and subplots that are cleverly woven together resulting in 700+ pages of reading enjoyment per book. No movie can fully do the final book, ""The Girl that Kicked the Hornet's Nest"", complete  justice. However the portrayal of the lead character Salander by Noomi Rapace is worth while viewing. The movie buzzes along with English subtitles and I fear that only past readers of the books will keep up, but those readers will greatly enjoy the film.",1378339200,,648,4.684210526315789

4269583,4,B0046H0HZ6,When a movie is based on a book I must read the book first. I know changes will be made to fit the script. I must say they stayed as close as possible to the book. It was a pleasure to see I just wish it wasn't the end of the series. GO LISBETH in your corner all the way.,1377820800,,272,3.55

4269596,2,B0046H0HZ6,I didn't care for the movie.  The book was a more exciting.  The movie didn't seem to be together.  It was a letdown because this was the best book.,1377475200,,148,4.0344827586206895
4269597,5,B0046H0HZ6,I thought this movie was pretty good and so I watched the whole thing.  It seemed to have a pretty good story line and the acting was pretty good too.,1377475200,,150,4.0

4269599,5,B0046H0HZ6,I really like to see this because it is English dubbed. I wanted to see it because the book was written in Sweeden and the movie filmed in Sweden. I saw the English version of Girl with the Dragon TAttoo and really liked it but they only make the first book. I did watch the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with English caption but it was not as good since I had to read it. Thanks for the English dubbed version. It was great.,1377388800,,423,4.0476190476190474
4269600,3,B0046H0HZ6,I didn't enjoy it as much as the first two movies. It didn't hold my interest and wasn't as fast paced as the first two.,1377388800,,120,3.84

The young star (the girl) doesn't have much dialog in any of the (movies) but she has excellent expressive facial/eye skills.  The movies follow the books quite well, with very few delineations, if you've read the books and then watch the films, it is wonderful to see them come to life.  However, I guess I'm spoiled, these are still foreign films and come across as such.  They don't have the finesse of American film wizardry.  In the ""acting"" sometimes the ""timing"" seems off. If you can overlook these few failings, the first 2 films are close captioned, this one is dubbed, you will probably enjoy them all as much as I did.  I would recommend this group of books and films and would enjoy reading/watching them again.",1377302400,,778,4.601449275362318

4269627,4,B0046H0HZ6,Film was very good and tied in well to the other two (Dragon Tattoo and Played with Fire) but the themes have begun to get tired. Revelations from the first two films continue in this one and there is much more conspiracy and many more conspiracy themes here.  Overlapping attempts to hush and oppress main characters and use government blindness and bureaucracy to keep truths from being known was often gut-wrenching and provided great tension. Somehow the  ultimate resolutions did not totally resolve the tension and angst but perhaps that was what they intended.,1374883200,,567,5.0212765957446805

Parts od the novel's plot were left out of the film, which is completely understandable ; the movie would have lasted forever otherwise.

I viewed the Sweedish version of ""The girl who played with fire"" with english subtitles on Sundance and enjoyed it but having to read subtitles takes away from being able to see the action.  I bought the english dubbed version of ""The girl who kicked the hornet's nest"" from Amazon.com and watched it the day it arrived in the mail.  Love, love, loved all these movies.  Too bad there will not be any more.",1367625600,,511,4.291666666666667

Subtitles were not a problem for me, even after watching the seven hours of the first two films. I think that fans of this trilogy are as obsessed as Star Wars fans, and that's a good thing! We finally have a film noir that answers our need for police procedurals, murder mysteries, and conspiracy theories all in one terrific three film cycle. Each of these three films is essentially self contained, that is, one can watch each on it's own and still feel that you know what is going on...as long as you are willing to work for it. This was one of my all time favorites, and I think that fans of the nbooks will be happy with the subtitled Extended Version.

I think mostly because the dubbing is generally terrible at best...through no fault of the studios...just through the fault of the letters and symbols used by other countries. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was subtitled, just wish this and Fire would at least have had the option available to me.",1365465600,,449,4.769230769230769
4269763,5,B0046H0HZ6,"The movie loosely follows the book but not much is lost in the telling. If you want more detail, start by reading book one through to the last one. The story is centered around Lizbeth and her challenges to fit into society. Society tries to dictate the way she should feel and behave and people in charge have not been listening to her so she simply acts out to keep people away.

4269782,5,B0046H0HZ6,"The book is better, of course, as it usually is in situations that don't easily translate to a visual media.  The three films view much better as a miniseries; even in that context there are holes in the character identifications until well after their first appearance.  Stick with it and much will be revealed.  Lisbeth's inability to acknowledge the assistance of others makes a lot more sense, even if it's as unbearable at the end as at the beginning.",1364601600,,456,4.746835443037975

4269797,4,B0046H0HZ6,This was the story that ended the trauma and made the whole trilogy come together.  The perversity of how well it played out shows a great creativity of the writer and the acting which put the sense of accomplishment and justice well within the realm of plausible and realistic in such a way you had to watch just to see how it ended.,1364256000,,334,4.301587301587301
4269798,5,B0046H0HZ6,Actors are perfect for their parts.  I like this better than the Hollywood version because the actors look like people you might see anywhere.  One thing I didn't understand is; why does a woman who works in high-tech surveillance approach the house of someone she knows is evil without checking for the kind of stuff she sees at work?,1364169600,,335,4.661016949152542

Very complex storyline that wraps intrigue within the well acted enigma of Lisbeth Salander (portrayed by Noomi Rapace). I highly recommend this entire film series to anyone interested in mystery and intrigue! Surprisingly true to book within the limits imposed by the nearly 2-1/2 hour production.,1364083200,,405,5.444444444444445

4269811,5,B0046H0HZ6,"what is sad is that the way this film is concluded is most likely not reality and in most cases a court will listen to the psychiatrist over the ""mentally ill"" person and most people wouldn't believe the ""mentally ill"" person or go to that much trouble to fight for their rights.  This film shows clearly that there is a group of people in our society that is severely abused and discriminated against.  I hope that the people who need to see this film see it.  It is an excellent film in every way.
But I don't think she should have refused his money - once he dies and if he left it to her, then it's no longer his money -it's hers.  I think this movie ties up so many loose ends and it does a great job of it.  It is the best of the 3 films in my opinion.",1363392000,,758,3.960526315789474

Not a fan of English subtitled movies because you can't turn away for a second or you will miss what was said.

4269844,5,B0046H0HZ6,"This is an outstanding and complex climax to a story with the most eccentrically fascinating characters that I have seen in a film in years.  It is original and utterly riveting.  While pulse pounding, there is not a single clich in the entire series.  This is a series that you can watch innumerable times, finding new detail and nuance every single time as if you were watching it for the first time.  It ranks with the absolute perfection of the Bourne series, at least with Damon as the principal.

Lisbeth is in custody, gravely wounded after the altercation with Zalachenco.  With a bullet lodged in her brain, she is under accusation for attempted murder.  Apparently part of the state, a mysterious group emerges that wants to keep the entire affair secret, because its acts, even its existence, would cause both official embarrassment and endanger its executives.  With the complicity of Lisbeth's psychiatrist, they decide to mount what can only be called a conspiracy.  This is not much of a spoiler, as it is evident in the first few minutes of the film.

Blomquist, of course, inserts himself into the dirty process, to help Lisbeth but also to get a story.  He enables Lisbeth to fight for her freedom, but more importantly, for her vindication.  But there are terrible threats in the meantime, which threaten all of his relationships.  The climax is a trial, with some help from hackers and even a different organ of the state.

The result is a totally believable and intelligent indictment of what occurred in the most civilized of modern democracies.  This series is a true masterpiece, on many levels.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.",1362700800,,1662,4.903225806451613

Further, it is fairly recent (2010) movie.

This movie is part of a trilogy (all 3 movies are superb). Make sure you watch it in this correct sequence:

1. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo
2. The Girl Who Played With Fire
3. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest

Note that the subtitled versions of the above movies are better than the English dubbed movies. The dubbed versions seem to downplay the otherwise fabulous audio and background sound.

I am so happy that it is available on Amazon Prime for free. Even if it were not, I would have paid to rent it! Yeah, that's how good it is!

If you like this movie, you will likely also like ""Headhunters,"" a movie from Norway that is subtitled in English. Other nice foreign movies are the German movie ""North Face"" (English Subtitled) and ""Cavite"" (a Philipino movie)that are very gripping. If you are into romances, check out the Dutch movie, ""Bride Flight"". All these other movies have an average star rating of 4 or higher on Amazon.",1361577600,,1293,4.604347826086957

The beginning of the movie is a little confusing because I did not see the previous one in the series. But after awhile having not seen the previous movie was not a factor and I settled it to watch a well done movie. I did see ""The Girl with The Dragon Tatoo"" and I thought that was too dark this one is not. I recommend that anyone watching it without prior knowledge of the series Google the movie and read the plot for the beginning if you have the discipline to stop after a few sentences.",1361318400,,578,4.123893805309734

4269874,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Let there be no doubt, this is not an American movie, it is a European film. But if you can handle the difference, it is absolutely worth watching. I rated this film at 5 stars, but I would have given it 6 or 7 if they allowed me to.

You absolutely need to watch ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" and then ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" before you see this one, as this is the cliffhanger final episode in the trilogy. All that said, let me add as much detail as I can without spoilers.

Noomi Rapace gives a brilliant performance as a deeply disturbed but fundamentally sane young woman who has been imprisoned in the mental healthcare system for burning her abusive father. And that sounds so hokey and cliche written out like that, but somehow it's not. There's really nothing cliche about this movie; it's actually brilliantly original, particularly against the backdrop of a Hollywood that can't seem to do anything but remakes of past successes.

This is an excellent story, well adapted to the medium of film, and extremely well-acted. Particularly in contrast to the last two films I have watched on Amazon, which were both nauseatingly worthless,  pre-digested Steven Soderbergh pablum of a stunningly soporific nature.",1360627200,,1230,4.787735849056604

4269888,5,B0046H0HZ6,This movie is well done even though it would be helpful but not necessary to have read the book first.  The photography is excellent and the transmission flawless.  I found the english dubbed version to provide very little distraction from the film.  Indeed it was quantum leaps better than having subtitles.  The plot is fairly complicated which make it interesting and the acting is very good as well.

Having seen ""Girl With Dragon Tatoo, in theater first, later to discover ""Girl Who Played With Fire"" , as second in series have quickly downloaded here,  as thrilled by other films.

My original intent in viewing first installment - 'Dragon Tatoo' was just to pass the time as I exercised.  I became totally absorbed in and intrigued by the movie - the plot, the acting and the characters were engrossing.  When I discovered that there were two more installments, I had to watch them. The second of the trilogy - ""Plays with Fire"" was a bit of a letdown from the first, but not disappointingly so. The final episode - ""Hornet's Nest"" is the best of the three and neatly wraps up the pieces of the puzzle developed in the first two. My first 5 star rating, and well deserved!",1359763200,,736,4.526315789473684

When we finally got a chance to watch the third episode, only the English dubbed version was available.

It makes sense that a girl who has survived in demonstrated such resistance with the perseverance reflecting a Herculean strength, yet has revealed an inner ability to care about things that truly matter in this world at her inner core-- dresses appropriately to demonstrate her strength on the outside and her resistance to wrongful control and oppression by others in power-- to protect her inner core that has been victimized nearly forever and yet somehow in the best ways--survived.

The movie gives hope for justice in this world-- when it is fought for by people who care enough to work outside the box and when the media is not oppressed as is the case throughout the trio of books.",1357776000,,738,4.896

The movies are good, but you must watch the extended versions (all >3 hrs in length), which were actually a 6 part miniseries originally vs the 3 2.5 hr  movies.  The regular movies are OK, but unless you've read the books, the storyline may seem a little thin across the board.  Definitely worth watching.

4269933,5,B0046H0HZ6,"I'm experiencing too much shock and awe to really comment at the moment. And not sure I can add anything that hasn't been already said. I preferred to listen to the movie in it's original language with English subtitles. I'm very happy that I chose this way of watching. The English subtitles were not at all distracting and very easy to follow. I know there are many who prefer not to have to read, but I so much enjoyed listening to the voices of the original actors, in their native language. And wow, my god, they were so incredibly good. I hope the two major actors become major stars, especially here in the states. This movie captivated me from beginning to end. Here in America, most Hollywood movies lack substance; too many filled with a lot of explosions or ""eye candy"" for the viewer. A lot of people have become programmed to wait for the big action scenes, such as in Expendables 1 and 2. However, I appreciated this movie for it's ""slow"" pacing. There's actually a story developing in this movie that's definitely worth waiting for the climax. If you like a movie that has great suspense, plotting, acting, direction, and scenery, than this movie and the others in the series is for you. Sure, this installment is like an episode of Law and Order, but so what. Funny, I don't really like goth looking chicks, but I fell in love with Salander's character. When you understand what has happened to her, you learn to look past her physical features and pay more attention to what's in her heart. It doesn't take long into this series to connect with her on a deep level. It really hurts to know that so many women and children have suffered at the hands of evil males. For this, I am saddened and have shed many tears - even now as I write this. Men reading this, please never abuse anyone. If you're an abused person seek help before you hurt someone else. No person deserves to have their soul taken from them. Sorry for the lecture, but if you've seen the movie, then you know where I'm coming from. And aren't movies like this intended to get people to think and react? Wow, guess, I had more to write than I thought after all.

Heads will role no matter the verdict, but it's nice to see the heroine win.

I love all 3 movies in this trilogy. I think that this one and the first movie are the best. If you are reading my review you have probably seen the other 2 movies.

The characters' positions and relations are mostly unclear, and I could hardly keep one guy from another the further the story went. I think the series could've been better done onscreen, though the first (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) movie would be hard to beat.

As the last part of the fascinating story of Lisbeth Salander, the film provides a satisfying and credible conclusion to her tale of abuse, intrigue, espionage, and skullduggery. As a movie, however, the film falls flat--primarily because Stieg Larsson's last book in the trilogy is packed with behind-the-scenes exposition and tons of internal monologues that simply don't translate well to the screen. The plot details here are beside the point--if you're a fan of the first two books and/or movies, you know the background and you know what's come before, so there are really very few surprises. What's missing from the film is the artistry and the drama that propelled the novel. The action scenes are few and far between, and they're decidedly less than gripping.

It's too bad the author didn't live to continue the series as he had planned, because the book and movie have sort of an open ending, but this also can be seen as winding up a host of plot points. The American versions of this book and the previous one, The Girl Who Played With Fire, have not been made, but based on a comparison between the U.S. and Swedish versions of the first movie, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I think the Swedes got it right. I don't want to give away much of the plot, which is convoluted like the first two novels/movies, but suffice it to say that I found the conclusion very satisfactory.

4269993,5,B0046H0HZ6,"A tormented woman's passion and courage - to reclaim her freedom & stature and bring to justice a misogynistic serial killer while befriending, aiding, rescuing, and making love to an investigative reporter in his own exhaustive hunt for the deadly truth - reigns supreme in the now classic Millennium Trilogy (in Swedish with sub-titles). Directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev for Yellow Bird Films; Mikael Blomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) and Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace); original three novels written by the late Swedish mystery novelist Stieg Larsson and superbly edited by Eva Gabrielsson. We are easily swept up in the complex, hyper-intriguing hunt by our heroine Lisbeth for a serial killer presented in a stunning sequential order of unfolding events and plot twists - that hold one almost in amazement at times.

So much has been written about these tightly-woven films and their positive impact upon women and girls around the world, their influence on the romance-thriller genre in novel writing & screenwriting, their ferocity to tell a high-end story about a pair of fiercely intelligent serial killers and still keep it reigned into a powerful but digestible film storyline, and their tenacity to reel in the sub-plots and multiple plot endings into a precise denouement along a superior crescendo or ascending mode of action with an original wildly-filmed plot. Depth of character, sustained plot tension, and powerful, realistic acting performances dominate each film in such a way - that we want to see them again.

Once in awhile we see these brilliant, pro-women, pro-active film trilogies take off and make their way into multiple languages - as if all along they were meant to be translated at breadneck speed throughout the world - so one and all - women and men - can drive a long distance to catch one or two of these films in sequence at a single movie theatre. And we are talking about movie goers going out in perhaps severe weather condition to see any one of these cinematic masterpieces. Realism, honesty, thorough journalistic practices, true mystery & suspense scriptwriting & storyboarding, sado-masochistic & erotic side-plots that tightly weave like electrifying eels returning to their comfort lair - back into the original storyline - all create an experiential type of cinema - that becomes exhilarating, challenging to the senses, sensual, and intensely played out for our enjoyment and enrichment.",1333411200,2,2466,5.209068010075566

That having been said, the only (given all the dramatic hoopla) puzzlement I have is this: Why did they leave out Salander seeing Blomkvist with Berger out? There doesn't seem to be any explanation as to why Lisbeth shuts Blomkvist out so completely. It makes this aspect seem sort of disjointed, even if you have read the novels.

Whatever ... I can't really be objective after having read them first. But the acting is wonderful.

4270003,4,B0046H0HZ6,"If the author had lived, he would have been pleased with the Swedish trilogy of his beloved series. The actress who played Lisbeth Salander is fantastic in both first and second films. This film picks up where the first one leaves off sort of.

Lisbeth is injured and sent to a hospital. We learn more about her past especially what drives her character. Lisbeth Salander is perhaps one of the most original, fascinating female characters in literature and in film to ever exist in my opinion. She's a fantastic enigma of sorts but you can't help but root for her character and the injustices along the way.

Anyway, I can't imagine the film without a fantastic cast and crew. Even though I elected to watch the film with English subtitles. I couldn't imagine watching it otherwise. Yes, I don't know Swedish but I think the film is fantastic and the fans of the series will enjoy it.

Still, I can't wait to see the third installment. Anyway, the DVD is perfect with no noticeable flaws. My only complaint is that I would have liked more features especially a focus on the author who has died before the books were ever published.

Through it all, she seemed to change very little and not sure I believe anyone could go through all she did not not change some or more than presented.

I was totally taken by surprise by the ""Dragon Tattoo"" and got further invested in ""Played With Fire"", but was certainly looking for more of a slam bam conclusion.  This overlong 2  hour movie played mostly like a really long episode of Law and Order - Sweden.  Of course the film needs to tie up the loose ends and send the bad guys to prison, but do we really need to dwell on each one so long?

My biggest complaint began with the previous movie in the series.  The relationship between Lisbeth (Noomi Rapace) and Mikael (Michael Nyqvist) isn't pursued, at least in the same film frame.  Even Lisbeth becomes more of the sociopath she already is.  Perhaps with good reason, but not very entertaining.  I'm perhaps half a star too generous but I like the overall story and characters so much, I can't help it.  Here is a stolen summary from ""Rotten Tomatoes"" which pretty much sums it up: ""Slow and mostly devoid of the stellar chemistry between its two leads, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is a disappointingly uneven conclusion to the Millennium trilogy.""

4270012,5,B0046H0HZ6,"To the point, DO NOT MISS THIS ""EXTENDED EDITION"" if you are interested in the Swedish film/TV production of Steig Larson's novel of the same name (or either of the other two productions in the series).  WHETHER OR NOT you have already seen the seriously truncated (shortened, mangled) version which was earlier released on DVD, BD, and streaming, THIS IS NOT TO BE MISSED.  Unlike the previously released version, this ""extended edition"" provides a coherent presentation.  Being one of the inexplicably over the top fans of anything connected with the three Larsen novels (or associated biographies, etc), I read all three novels early this year and then waited with bated breath for the ""movie"" versions.  I was seriously disappointed with all three earlier, shortened movie releases, and particularly the last two of the three in the series.  This was because new characters suddenly showed up on the screen without either sufficient introduction, or even identification.  Or there were very significant holes in the story line (in addition to those already extant in the novels!).

As many of you will know, the three novels were filmed for Swedish television, with one film for each of the three novels.  This disc presents one of the three films as originally formed and appearing on Swedish television - each film, including this one, was broken into two segments of approximately 90 minutes in length, for a movie lasting a total of 180 minutes.  When the Swedish TV version was presented in American theaters (and DVDs and BDs, the latter which I own), it was re-edited, and seriously shortened.  As far as I am concerned, this ruined all three original ""movie"" presentations.

Despite the fact that the productions were evidently produced for first showing on Swedish TV, the production values (both sight and sound) are certainly comparable to those of first rate American movies.  This reviewer does not know but strongly suspects that the producers had ultimate theater showing in mind when the films were made.

And finally, the Amazon's streamed version of the Extended Edition is free of notable artifacts on this reviewer's 109 inch Stewart Screen - in the streamed version the color balance and brightness are good - the black levels, interfered with by encoding and transmission noise, do not equal that of the BluRay disc, but are certainly acceptable.

4270022,4,B0046H0HZ6,"The thrilling ""Millenium trilogy"" comes to a close with ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"". If ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was more of a mystery/thriller, and ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" was more of an action/thriller, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" defies expectations and ends up being more of a courtroom drama/thriller.

When last we found Lisbeth, she had survived a handful of gunshot wounds at the hands of her monstrous father and thug half-brother, although, unfortunately, both had survived as well. At the beginning of the film we find Lisbeth in the hospital, recovering slowly from her wounds, while facing an attempted murder charge for assaulting her father with an axe. For the first half of the film, Lisbeth is frail and vulnerable, sequestered in the hospital, being cared for by a compassionate doctor who, along with Mikael, is one of the few people (especially men) in her life who shows kindness toward her. This allows actress Noomi Rapace to show another side to her character, and even when Lisbeth is quiet and subdued she radiates defiant charisma, and a magentic combination of strength and vulnerability. This really is one of the best characters in recent cinema.

Meanwhile, Mikael, whose story is ever-entwined with Lisbeth's (despite the fact that they have shared little screen time together since the first film), is planning a special issue of his magazine to expose the systemic corruption that has allowed Lisbeth to be repeatedly abused and violated. Mikael also enlists his fiesty attorney sister to provide legal counsel to Lisbeth.

This time most of the action and battles take place in the courtroom, where Lisbeth confronts every one of the monsters in her life. The problem is that the entire system is committed to keeping Lisbeth quiet and having her discredited. Her father, a defected Russian spy, was being illegally protected by the government, and following Lisbeth's violent assault on him when she was twelve, Lisbeth was illegally institutionalized and declared mentally incompetent. Although her evil father and Guardian are dead by the time we get to the courtroom, Lisbeth's predatory psychiatrist, as well as the rest of the rogue government operatives who protected her father, are all heavily invested in keeping her quiet.

Lisbeth, ever committed to refusing to play the role of the victim, shows up to court looking like a gothic warrior. With much help from Mikael and his sister, Lisbeth finally gets the chance to publicly tell - and prove - her story, exposing the monsters who violated her and the system that allowed it.

Whereas as the first movie (Girl...Dragon Tattoo) was so full of great twists and turns it blew me away both emotionally and it was literally physically draining to watch.

The second (Girl...Fire) was just plain stupid especially given how Lisbeth escapes from being buried alive and the Jaws-like (007 James Bond references r us) parody of a villain can feel no pain. This one is a straight procedural taking place mainly in offices, courts, hospitals and jail cells. The story feels confined like its setting.

Sorry, but after the first movie I was expecting way more from this series and it deteriorated into just repeating everything over and over again. The thing was way too obvious and wrapped up way too easily. The ambiguity the first film played with just got lost over the next two films as the focus was way too much on Lisbeth's life itself whereas the first one the focus was on how Lisbeth and the Swedish journalist team up to bring down a Nazi.",1313971200,,1084,4.670157068062827

4270029,3,B0046H0HZ6,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo stands as its own story, and one that belonged more to Blomkvist than Salander. The Girl Who Played With Fire delved into Salander's backstory, and this final chapter in the Millenium Trilogy is really just a sequel to that part. As a denouement, it lacks the same shock and fire of the other movies. In spite of seeing Salander all decked out in mohawk, black makeup, and studded collars (for her murder trial, no less), this is a tamer version of the heroine who fought her own revolution against the establishment in the first two stories.

It might have something to do with the fact that she spends half the movie in a hospital room with a bullet hole in her head, and the other half waiting in prison or in a courtroom. She's still sharp, surly, and utterly confounding, but she can't set anyone on fire, take an axe to their noggins, or blackmail them with hidden videos. She does get one last Silence-of-the-Lambs-esque scene, as the movie ties up the final loose end, but it could have used more of these types of scenes.

With Salander laid up, it again falls to Blomkvist to spend the movie tracking down the secret government section that has made everyone's life miserable. Michael Nyqvist is as good an actor as these movies get, but this story is simply less interesting than the serial killer angle of the first film. The film also excises a subplot from the book involving Blomkvist's partner Erika Berger, turning her into an unsympathetic, easily frightened wimp. Coincidentally, this is Erika's most screentime of the three films. Too bad they left the original character behind.

Nonetheless, the film is entertaining, and the resolution is satisfying, though not as explosive as one would hope. Salander still remains one of the great enigmatic characters, and it's nice to see her making no attempt to re-enter society.",1312934400,,1874,4.795665634674923

This is the Swedish version of the film, 3rd in the trilogy, but is in English--you do not have to read subtitles (unless you want to).  Of course, it is dubbed, but the dubbing is very well done.

EXTENDED TRILOGY
Note that there is an ""very extended edition"" of the trilogy available, which is an alternative.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Tattoo-Trilogy-Extended-Edition/dp/B005JTLTI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition</a>&nbsp;Actually, it is the original ca 12-hour 6-part mini-series which was shown on Swedish TV, in Swedish, with English subtitles.  Because it is more complete, it is much easier to follow the story.  There are more, and more detail sex scenes.

DESCRIPTION
""The Girl Who Kicked A Hornet's Nest"" is based on the third book of Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium Trilogy"", and does a good job of following the book.  The director does an excellent job of simplifying the story to the point that it stands on its own and can be seen and followed by viewers who have not seen the first two. (Although I highly recommend the first two).  The first, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" may be hard to follow if you have not read the book.

The infamous ""rape scene"" is repeated--but almost only short snippets of the audio.  The only ""nudity"" is a presumably female butt seen for several seconds.

This actually being a ""foreign"" movie is not a Hollywood product.  That means that the characters far more closely resemble real human beings rather than the typical airbrushed Hollywood drones.  The quality of the acting is superb.  It is a story, superbly told (compared to many Hollywood products which are mostly sex and/or action with little plot).  No explosions.  No boobs.  Just a great story.

THE STORY
Lisbeth Salander (an antisocial girl presumed suffering from Aspberger's Syndrome) has been arrested for the attempted murder of her nasty Soviet-spy father, (Alexander Zalachenko).  A dormant underground Swedish Cold War espionage agency (""The Section""), presses for her conviction, to protect itself from being exposed by Zalachenko.  Simultaneously, she is being stalked by her half-brother Ronald Niedermann, who was Zalachenko's assistant/partner.  Lisbeth's friend, the editor of a magazine called ""Millennium"", Mikael Bloomquist, her former employer (owner of a security agency), and friend hacker come to her defense in the background, undercovering the facts which save her.  In the courtroom, Lisbeth is defended by Mikael's sister and lawyer.  The ""modern"" Swedish security agency is also ""on the case"" investigating ""The Section"".

EVALUATION
A nail-biter.  It's very hard to hit the ""pause"" button for a bathroom break.  The three hours go by very quickly.  The best movie I have seen in a very long time.  ""The Girl Who Kicked A Hornet's Nest"" is indeed a ""movie"", not a ""film"", which surely disappoints many anal-retentive, self-appointed ""film"" critics.  Unlike ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" there is nothing edgy nor political--other than a less than flattering portrayal of the Swedish justice system.  It is pure entertainment as a superbly told story.  That's a compliment).

SUGGESTION
Consider buying the DVD rather than downloading--you'll want to see this movie again in a few years, or every few years.

4270032,4,B0046H0HZ6,"""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" (2010), (147 minutes), is third and last in the Swedish film series based on the action-filled Millennium Trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson. It is a violent, dark and suspenseful thriller and a courtroom drama as well.  It is not, however, quite as intense or engrossing as the first in the series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-With-the-Dragon-Tattoo/dp/B003FBNJ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>. For one thing, it's got much less plot, and the pacing is rather leisurely, all things considered. Expert computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), spends much of the picture flat on her back in hospital, recovering from injuries sustained in the second episode of the story.  She is the prime suspect in the murder of three people, facing trial, and targeted for death by various thugs.  Her friend and former lover Mikael Blomkvist(Michael Nyquist), crusading editor of the muck-raking journal Millenium, is trying to prove her innocence, but, in order to prove her innocence of the charges, she's going to have to share details of her sordid past with the court.

HORNET'S NEST, like its predecessors in the series, gives us a lot of Sweden on screen: the buildings, their interiors, the cars and traffic of its cities.  The coffee-fueled lives of its citizens.  It's expertly done, and these are things that I doubt the American versions will be able to provide.  The controlled underacting of its principals helps to keep the film grounded.  Mind you, it does sometimes seem that Lisbeth must have superhuman powers to survive the things she does: still, like the rest of us, she occasionally fuels up by inhaling the odd pizza. And I wish I had a dollar for every movie I have sat through, silently screaming, while some inane heroine shrieks and cries as hero and villain fight to the finish. I always want to yell at the woman on the screen, for heaven's sake, pick up that lamp and hit the guy on the head with it. Lisbeth does, and then some.

Probably the best-known Swedish films before this series would have been those by world-famous Swedish director Ingmar Bergman&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ingmar-Bergman-Four-Masterworks-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000WC39FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ingmar Bergman: Four Masterworks: The Criterion Collection</a>.

The Criterion Collection (I Am Curious Yellow / I Am Curious Blue Set)</a>. The film under discussion, like its predecessors in the Millenium series, gives a production credit to Yellow Bird, a company that seems to have some connection to I AM CURIOUS, the granddaddy of Swedish soft-core porn.

4270040,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Stieg Larsson's world-wide best-seller third volume in his trilogy about Lisbeth Salander is undoubtedly far better than the film based on it. This generally happens with movies based on novel, because the book develops its characters better, the plot is augmented with more subplots, there is more relevant actions that add to the understanding of the characters and plot, and the suspense, therefore, is more palatable. This film however is very good. Both people who read the book and those who didn't will enjoy it. It presents the best of the story in an orderly and understandable fashion. The acting is excellent. There is drama and suspense when we watch the people trying to prove that Lisbeth is not insane, that she was persecuted and imprisoned in an insane asylum to hide the machinations of an illegal part of the government, and in the attempt to make this information public.  We watch the old men of the infamous cabal trying to protect themselves by frightening and killing all who can testify against them and we wonder how they can be stopped.",1307664000,,1063,4.87292817679558
4270041,4,B0046H0HZ6,"The Swedish version of the book ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" really slogs through all the overabundance of detail that I did not like about the book but it also chops out a few sub-plots that I quite enjoyed at the time of reading.  Still, the film has more than enough action and intrigue to recommend it.

Differences and Similarities:

I'm not going to detail all the changes from the book to the film but I do want to point out a few of the sub-plots that I enjoyed.

The whole Erika Berger joins SMP (a rival magazine) was chopped out entirely, although the filmmakers kept in the threatening emails.  Unlike the book, the threatening emails' source is never revealed, although implied that it was The Section, a secret organization within the government to protect Zalachenko and their plot to get rid of a dangerous witness, Lisbeth Salander.

But Erika in the film caves in and does not want to publish the tell-all about The Section and gets mad at Mikhail Blomkvist for doing so anyway.  This was so uncharacteristic from the book, where Erika was much more willing to take risks.  In the film she is a decided wimp in many ways!

Figueroa, a favorite character in the book with her almost fanatical working out regime, and falls for Blomkvist and his womanizing ways, is relegated to a secondary character.  In fact, there is no womanizing at all.  Some readers may breathe a sigh of relief on this fact, but for me I missed the sub-story.

Salander's travels to Gibraltar and Paris are cut out, as well as the entire storyline of Berger being stalked by a crazed journalist in the very paper she is working at.  Further, no mention of Berger getting a new editorial position at a rival paper, nor any mention of scandal at said paper.

In fact, there is not a lot of character development in the film, which is to be expected in an adaptation.  The same actors and actresses reprise their roles in this film and it's great to see.

Salandar walking into the court with her full Goth attire was a sight!  And Teleborian being found to be a liar and a pedophile was great as well.

Bottom Line:  The film makes much more sense right after reading the book.  I'm unsure if a person who has not read the book would be able to fully understand the back story of what is going on.  However the court scenes with Salander and her lawyer, Blomkvist's sister Annika, make for some fine storytelling.",1307232000,,2413,4.539351851851852

Erika Berger's leaving for and harassment at SMP, the investigation by the Constitutional Protection Unit, and Mikael Blomkvist's affair with Monica Figuerola, were too much part of the story to be deleted.

4270047,5,B0046H0HZ6,"Continuing where part 2 left off,Lisbeth Salander the feisty hacker who has been investigating the links between her estranged father Zalachenko and the Swedish secret service,is in intensive care in hospital recovering from gunshot wounds. She is under police guard as she has been charged with attempted murder of her father. Blomkvist is on the trail of the same story,both for his magazine Millenium and to prove Lisbeth's innocence, showing how the authorities have conspired against her under the guise of an organisation called `the Section'.While Salander fights to regain her health,striking a balance between aggression and vulnerability,Rapace works hard to convey Lisbeth's tetchy genius,her slowly gathering strength well projected.

Blomkvist is in his element,tailing wrongdoers,digging through files and having secret meetings,he teams up with the security police,who want to close down `the Section'protecting Zalachenko,using information of members names from Blomkvist. The elderly members are getting anxious,one shoots Zalachenko in hospital and commits suicide, another targets staff at the Millenium with email threats. Gullberg teams up with Peter Teleborian,the psychiatrist,who abused Lisbeth as a child,to make sure she is declared insane at her trial. While the police close in on the Section,Blomkvist enlists his lawyer sister,and a friendly doctor,to help Salander write an account of her true story,also to prove Salander's father was a Russian spy,working outside the law,the hacker Plague uncovers false psychiatric evaluations and the seamy underbelly of child pornography.

The Blomkvist plot gives the film its narrative momentum,finding a Le Carre-eque,post-cold war conspiracy and political cover-up. With a Nordic chill and penultimate,thriller action. The climactic courtroom drama is claustrophobic,muffled in secrecy and twists. The two chief protagonists reunite for the 1st time since they parted ways at the end of Dragon Tattoo,a strange dysfunctional relationship,with the unspoken bond of love. Alfredson instils the enigma back into his asocial protagonist,a mysterious undertow that is bravely left unresolved,this incandescent damaged individual. Part 2 lost its freshness and sagged.

4270048,4,B0046H0HZ6,"In the first book, we were introduced to a mystery that showed us a killer and a disappearance and connections to a certain young lady. In the second book we explored this character and the man she had befriended from the first, but the story was mainly becoming one about her. In the third we have it all wrapped up, with one reviewer aptly calling this her v. the system.

When it comes to movies that are not really sequels, you do not have to worry as much. True, sequels are dangerous and they sometimes melt braincells. Also true - if you stand too close to a sequel and stare at it, it might burn you like the sun. The thing is this is one of a three part system, and the system is exploring - not adding - in a lot of ways.

When you look at the first two movies, you see that these are different movies. Had this gone that way, becoming another piece of the puzzle, it would have been a hard section to ignore. Instead it took another way and it because a 2nd part of the 2nd movie, essentially doing a Kill Bill on you in some ways. It did go into sexuality, relations, living, and other things BUT the other movies either did this or hinted at it. It also has Daddy issues and other things pop back up, allowing the door to be closed but also talking about costs. Sometimes it isn't even anything, just her doing some odds and ends. At least she did not shop for groceries - she has skill and I would hate to have to say if she did that well or not.

I know jokes are jokes and they take up space and I am not being mean. I personally liked this story but it reminded me a lot of something that could have happened in the 2nd part. Why? Because this was basically about business she did not take care of then, and stuff that bites her hard. People like to say they admire her for some of her actions, like the way she dealt with the trust officer. When he is found dead with a little scribbling on his chest and a video, would you want to be her then? She has a weird life, sometimes a really bad one, but she has talents. The thing is that it seems hard to get out from under the past.

The character here is top notch, giving you a 5/5. Still, the story is more of a 3/5, continuing a little more than simply being. If this had done more or aspired more i would have given it an easy 5. also, I think I am grading it against the first 2 movies, and that makes it harder. Whatever the case, it is a 4/5, almost a 5/5. It is good and, for people who liked the last pieces, you need this to even it out.",1304121600,,2513,4.02

Basically, I guess Steig Larsson phoned this one in though I haven't read the novel so I can't say for sure and no one can ask him now.  My problem with the story is the lack of development between Mikael and Elizabeth, and Elizabeth and her half brother; it feels like he introduced that Niedermann character simply as a plot device to further the story then failed to have any resolution reached at the end.

4270061,2,B0046H0HZ6,"and you get a real movie. Normally, with this many reviews already written, I wouldn't bother but I feel the need to tip the scales here. I've read all three books and loved them. I saw the 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' prior to reading the book and I liked it a lot. But when I watched it again after reading the book it no longer seemed very good. These books are simply too dense in plotting and contain more nuance than can be communicated in the running time of these movies. Even with clever script writing it would take for sure two, maybe three movies to cover each book.

This movie begins moments after the second movie ends. Lisbeth is in the hospital with gunshot wounds. She'll be treated and put on trial. Micke is working to get her off the rap and expose the bad guys who put her there. This is a hefty book. It has a lot of characters and an involved plot. As hard as they tried there just isn't a way to pack all this into a two and a half hour movie. The courtroom scene alone could easily eat up that much clock.

The producers were able to keep all the principle actors in their rolls and have introduced an entire stable of new ones to fill in all the rolls that pop up here. All do well with what they have to work with but it isn't much. The characters and plot points are little more than sketches. David Fincher is (as of this writing) in post-production on 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' and I'm really concerned if he can pull this off. He's one of my favorite directors and I'd hate to see him turn in a stinker.

I realize I'm at a disadvantage having read the books. I cannot bring a fresh perspective to the viewing experience of these movies. If there are any out there that have seen these and not read the books I would enjoy your take on them. Maybe they're better than I give them credit for.

4270064,1,B0046H0HZ6,"Ah, the Millenium Trilogy, or as another reviewer correctly put it, The Good, The Bad, and the Unbelievably Boring. Of course, we all know what I'm referring to with each term- Good (DT), Bad (PWF) and... yeah.

I wasn't gonna review the sequels in the first place, because keeping in mind and all hype aside, clearly the only good movie in the series was Dragon Tattoo. It's evident from frame one of Played With Fire that they weren't even trying to make quality sequels, and alas, this is the perfect example of why some trilogies just plain should never be. But, hey, I've already created a bit of a monster here, so why leave it incomplete.

The lack of any memorable scenes is back, and worse than ever. A bit of good news for ya though, this movie does, in some scenes, restore the visual palette of Dragon Tattoo, how some scenes look gothic and at times, even pretty. Oh, and the acting is good too. That may be about it. The film continues the plot of the second movie, where Lisbeth, recovering from the gunshot wound to the head she survived, finds herself on trial for the murders in the second movie, with Blomkvist there to help her prove her innocence.

Making a return is our favorite stupid goon, Niedermann. That's right, the big, tall, blonde idiot who can't feel any pain and walks around being Oooooooh so scary and nervous and is unexplained. It's rather unfortunate that potential for a good villain was wasted, because Niedermann could have been the perfect villain. Perhaps this is Larsson's fault, but it's still no excuse.

The film isn't without its share of plotholes. The antagonist, Zalachenko, is killed off 20 minutes into the movie in a murder-suicide, which is over before it even begins, and this creates a lot of problems with the plot, especially since a lot of questions are raised about him in the trial scenes. Who is even on whose side again? This was a problem in Played With Fire, and here it's even more irritating, because we only know that Mikael is the one person who will stop at nothing to prove Lisbeth innocent. There is a subplot regarding death threats sent to one of Mikael's coworkers, and this is later left to die... which is a frustrating since it could have been SO interesting to begin with.

And of course, let's not forget the trial scenes. They're ridiculous, rushed, and boring beyond belief. I actually expected Judge Judy to come out at one point and kick the judge aside to deal with the case herself. I actually kinda wished that would happen since they're the one way this movie could be interesting.

Fortunately, Noomi Rapace does an excellent job yet again. She is a gorgeous and very talented actress, and she kills again as Lisbeth here. Aside from Noomi, this film is a clear cut case of why some trilogies should just never happen.",1300924800,6,2809,4.6305220883534135

4270068,4,B0046H0HZ6,"""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" is the film finish to Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy. While ""Hornet's Nest"" doesn't have some of the action of it's predecessors ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-With-the-Dragon-Tattoo/dp/B003FBNJ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>,"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Played-With-Fire/dp/B003YOZNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Played With Fire</a>"" the unfolding drama and characters keep you hooked in for the finale.

""Hornet's Nest"" picks up with Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) in the hospital after the show down with her father Soviet defector Alexander Zalachenko (Georgi Staykov), and Frankensteinian half brother Ronald Niedermann (Micke Spreitz). As she convalesces, she is technically under arrest for the attempted murder of her father, and the system and  people who have tried to keep her incarcerated make one final attempt to put her away for good claiming she's a paranoid schizophrenic. While all this is going on, Mikael is planning to run an issue of his Millenium magazine that will exonerate Lisbeth by exposing the secret agency within the Swedish government called ""The Section"" dedicated to keeping Zalachenko and his secrets forever hidden.

Most of ""Hornet's Nest"" is a legal procedural of Lisbeth's defense in court and her attorney, and Mikael's sister Annika Giannini (Annika Hallin). Due to the nature of the evidence presented and the way it's intercut with the other plot lines the movie keeps a fast pace as the intrigue is unraveled and as ""The Section"" tries to strike back at Mikael.

""Hornet's Nest"" maintains the quality of the acting and the filmmaking at the same level as the previous films. The biggest shortcoming in ""Hornet's Nest"" is that it doesn't let Lisbeth do what she does best, be a hacker! Some of the coolest scenes in ""Dragon Tattoo"" where the scenes of Lisbeth fighting back against the system and people that mistreated her. In ""Hornet's Nest"" she is almost passive in her defense and lets others hack into computers for the information that can save her.

In the scenes with Mikael and Lisbeth there's a whole lot of subtext going on, sexual tension, and what they can't seem to say to each other but is exchanged in meaningful looks really doesn't go anywhere because the characters don't go anywhere with it. Maybe Larsson intended the relationship develop over a period of time and books, but it seems a distraction at the end.

The film begins with a view from an apartment building. Lisbeth is bloody and battered. The police stop for a body in the road; is he alive? Very much so. Did the Swedish authorities conspire against Lisbeth Salander to protect a psychopathic killer? Will the magazine `Millennium' expose others? Will Zalashenko talk too much? ""Trust no one""? Lisbeth tried to kill her father with an axe. [You can't chop your Poppa in Sweden.] Self -defense? She needs a lawyer now. A lone gunman in a hospital? Was he after Lisbeth? Why? Friedrich goes to an apartment building to report to his co-conspirators. Who is watching Mikael? [Can he note the license plate?] A purse snatcher on the street? An important report? Lisbeth is getting better. Mikael talks to her doctor. One reporter saw the log of visitors to the Prime Minister that day.

Mikael seeks more information from an official. Another man hacked into official computers sfor information. A government agency is investigating a conspiracy in the government. Will he cooperate? A deal is suggested. The intrigue continues. Lisbeth's attitude won't help her. Niederman has been around. Is there proof for Lisbeth's autobiography? Erika gets an anonymous E-mail, again. Lisbeth is examined by a magistrate (the Civil Law system of Europe). She has that DVD for evidence. Erika gets another threat by E-mail. Their telephone conversations are monitored. [SOP in Europe - no Bill of Rights.] How much damage can `Millennium' do? Can they damage the credibility of Mikael? Planted drugs and money? Two nasty men have been brought into the county. A man with a pistol approaches Mikael! The police arrive in time. It was part of a frame-up to smear Mikael in a gang shooting. [Only big money can afford to do this.]

Lisbeth will go to trial; she could get life in prison. Will she dress up to appear like an average person? No photographs in the courtroom. The defense rejects the accusations. A closed trial for National Security? Lisbeth now answers the questions accurately and sanely. Erika wants a vacation. The official doctor classifies her as ""paranoid schizophrenic"" because of her allegations against her guardian Bjurman. He denies Lisbeth's charges, but the court rule the report out. Does this doctor have a secret? Can a hacker gather evidence?

Lisbeth has a DVD to prove her claims. Her advocate presents new evidence about Doctor Peter Telleborium. His credibility is questioned, his reports were falsified. [Isn't this often true in many cases?] After this he is arrested for child pornography! The Court will not detain Lisbeth now. That ""Section"" is under arrest now. ""Sell it all and give the money to charity."" [Lisbeth is legally sane now.] She goes to investigate an old building, alone and unarmed. There is a surprise. Can Lisbeth outwit the bad guys? Will there be a happy ending? These films attempt to make a heroine out of a violent and mentally-ill person. This story is just too incredible.

This seems to be sensationalist series that has little redeeming social value except as an expose of Swedish society, if true. The stories of Per Wahl and Maj Sjwal were much better in providing a background of Swedish life. These films talked about various crimes as prostitution, drug smuggling, gun running, etc. but only dealt with sheltering a defector during the Cold War. Does this refers to some kind of scandal there? I wasted many hours on these films, and wouldn't do it if I knew then what I know now.",1300147200,,3534,4.932773109243698

To make up for it, his newest effort kicks off with a clip show of the bloody ending from ""Played With Fire,"" followed by some gory surgical imagery. However, after this distasteful beginning, nothing happens.

Really, nothing. Lisbeth Salander spends the entire film in hospital or jail, accused of murdering her evil father. The denouement is sort of like a courtroom drama, except without any tension: thanks to the efforts of righteous journalist Mikael Blomkvist, the prosecution's case falls apart as soon as Salander's attorney opens her mouth. Up to that point, the movie consists of Blomkvist running around looking determined, while shadowy bad guys try to intimidate his team in various incompetent ways. There is a scene where the villains confer together in their secret hideout, and ominously decide to increase the pressure against Blomkvist. The very next scene shows Blomkvist's lover/colleague receiving a threatening e-mail. Certainly this is scary, but man, these are rogue spies, veterans and professionals; it took them a whole meeting, and the best they could come up with is registering a single anonymous e-mail account.

Blomkvist and his muck-raking magazine Millennium are meant to be exemplars of journalistic honesty and integrity, incorruptible truth-tellers who live on the edge, speak truth to power, and stand guard over a free society. The funny thing is, in this movie their vision has narrowed to saving a single individual at any cost, based as much on Blomkvist's personal feelings about her as on his principles. The previous movie tried to work in a journalistic angle, with Millennium publishing an expose on sexual trafficking. This movie does not even mention that plot line; so much for giving voice to the voiceless.

The villains are once again marginal bogeymen. The previous movie darkly hinted that Lisbeth's evil father was secretly supported by the Swedish government, due to his political usefulness as a former KGB spy. But here, it turns out that he was merely supported by a rogue faction of the government, so rogue and so secret that nobody else in the government had any knowledge of its activities over the course of thirty years (hence, no one is really responsible). As soon as this rogue cell is exposed, everyone is appropriately shocked and horrified, and the real government rides in to save the day and arrest the conspirators. Furthermore, government agents approach Blomkvist early on and offer to work with him, effectively turning Millennium into an unofficial arm of the powers that be. The establishment barely even needs Blomkvist and his merry men. Come, now, I've seen better conspiracies and portrayals of a-man-alone integrity in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/movies/dp/B00000ILBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">movies</a>.

You can always count on Stieg Larsson to snatch up an easy cliche. The first movie featured an insane Nazi psychopath; the second had a savage Russian gangster. Here, the rogue spies finally decide to assassinate Blomkvist; to that end, they hire two thugs. The good cops describe these thugs as being ""from Serbia"" and ""quite nasty,"" because ""they were snipers during the war."" Couldn't the screenwriters at least make a minimal effort to go beyond cheap ethnic stereotype, and tack on some accusations of trafficking or child molestation or something? Naturally, the thugs' military experience does nothing to make them more professional at thuggery. Their plan for assassinating Blomkvist is to walk into the restaurant where he's eating and wildly shower the entire place with automatic fire, which is the method of choice for any experienced sniper. When this brilliant plan fails (cue&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fat-Tony/dp/B0009NZ2VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fat Tony</a>: ""I told you we should have bought more than three bullets!""), they attempt to beat him up, yet miserably fail to subdue a doughy journalist on the brink of middle age.

Oh yeah, the big silent goon from the last movie is here too. In his brief, episodic appearances, he wanders around committing totally unmotivated murders, makes one half-hearted attempt to shoot Salander, instantly gives up when he encounters difficulties, and retreats to a remote hideout, where he sulks at his TV screen. He has no connection to the rogue spies, to Salander's trial, or really to any part of the movie's plot. By the time Salander gets around to her revenge, his role has become highly anti-climactic. There's no discernible reason why he needed to survive for the third movie.

Salander's revenge highlights the weaselly moral stance of the entire franchise. In the three movies, she is shown a) disfiguring bad guys; b) taking pleasure in their deaths; and now c) directly bringing about their deaths; but not once does she ever personally pull the trigger (in this case, of the nail-gun). The movies are uncomfortable with that idea, however much they might argue that Salander's violence is justified. Here, she nails the big goon's feet to the floor with the nail-gun, and she's all ready to deliver the killing blow to the head, but she doesn't. But it's not because she's had a change of heart! No, she hisses that the guy deserves to die, she just...runs out of nails. But then she reveals the goon's whereabouts to his enemies, so that they can kill him. Way to have your cake and eat it too. Really, Alfredson, if you think Lisbeth is justified, why don't you have the courage of your convictions? And if you don't think so, why are you foisting her on us?

I suppose fans of the series must find something in it, but I watched the whole trilogy, and I can't begin to fathom what that might be. All I can suggest is to avoid it completely, if you can.",1299628800,7,6406,5.625258799171843

4270076,3,B0046H0HZ6,"Some have criticized Larsson's trilogy on the basis of its literary merits (or lack of them), but a good movie requires little more than a good story--and an actor with sufficient ""resonance"" to hold our attention for the duration. Without such a character, the burden on the director is all the greater. Some of Alfred Hitchcock's later films suffer because the Master is less quick to remove a potentially gratuitous scene, more hesitant about deleting non-essential footage and keeping the final print well within the limits of the spectator's patience.

The 3rd cinematic episode in the series runs well over 2 hours, and by now we have become all too familiar with the mono-dramatic acting of Noomi Rapace.  Hers is not a face like Greta Garbo's or Jimmy Stewart's, capable of registering a gamut of intriguing and complex moods and emotions.  Like her clothing, hair, make-up, etc., the face has taken on the iconic expression of someone whose past comprises a series of abuses, violations, and wrongs inflicted upon her; its present expression, in turn, is one of unremitting, smoldering resentment toward those who had long ago stolen her life.

Admittedly, there is bound to be a ""coolness"" magnetism at play with such a character, and no doubt many are drawn to, and identify with, her counter-cultural qualities, her hipness, her fierce spirit of independence and ability to survive.  But even if the character impresses us as ""the quintessence of cool,"" that quality alone is insufficient to sustain 8 hours of cinematic story--and all the more so when some sections are reminiscent of out-takes from a ""Friday the 13th"" movie (down to the predictable--and very lame--reappearance of the miscreate, or menacing creature who is her brother, in the film's closing minutes.

There's a lot that could be done with the characters we're introduced to - especially more with her half-brother Ronald, which isn't fully explored - he seems like only an after-thought at the end.

After watching all three movies in the series the most amazing part is that Sweden is presented as a police state with openly corrupt legal system. According to these movies Sweden is populated by morons, whose ineptitude is the only thing saving them from sliding into full totalitarianism.

Just an example: there is lot of intrigue going around the desire to avoid public exposure during a trial, however, it did not occur to the corrupt prosecutor that the easiest way out is to drop the charges.

It is indicative to the overall content of the movies that jails look like the best place to be in Sweden: comfortable and quiet with friendly staff gently pushing for healthy life style.

The court proceedings are real shock: mentally incapacitated person could be tried for murder, accused has to testify against self, prosecution witness can lie with impunity and the prosecutor does not seem even a little bit concerned that he could be disbarred if he made opposing attorney angry enough.

4270095,4,B0046H0HZ6,"THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST is the third and final installment of the Stieg Larssen trilogy. Noomi Rapace returns as Goth Girl Lisbeth Salander, and though she has a reduced role in HORNET'S NEST, Rapace's Salander so dominates the mind of the viewer that she exists even beyond the confines of the screen. This is a classic and a signature role.

THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO introduced us to Lisbeth Salander and her dark universe. DRAGON TATTOO was a very noir, very unconventional, shocking and disturbing, even frightening, film replete with indelible images of violence and rage. The follow-up film, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, brought Lisbeth's story more into the mainstream, and did not have that same haunting quality. THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST, while it also fails to haunt the viewer, does powerfully catch hold of the imagination.

As HORNET'S NEST opens, Lisbeth is being treated for the injuries she suffered in PLAYED WITH FIRE. Her strange past has caught up with her, and now it is evident that since childhood she has been the unwitting linchpin in an unsavory scandal reaching into the highest levels of the Swedish government. Those who would keep the secret have silenced her all her life and are still attempting to keep her silent---whether by buying her off, locking her away, or outright killing her. Her friend, journalist Mikael Blomqvist, is feverishly working to publish her story, removing the metaphorical rock, and exposing the creeping things beneath to the light of day. Everyone's life is endangered.

A good portion of HORNET's NEST is concerned with Salander's Competency Hearing, a dry procedural tale during which Lisbeth says little but dominates the setting, dressed in full warpaint including leathers and a vicious spiked mohawk, absolutely in control of her fate no matter the outcome. The O. Henry ending is grimly satisfying.

Although HORNET'S NEST pales next to DRAGON TATTOO, it is an excellent, surprising film rife with talent, particularly Rapace. Sadly, it is the last of Larssen's tales. We won't be seeing Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander again, and that, more than anything, is a great artistic loss.

***

Having since seen the Director's Cut of the trilogy (which adds a full two-and-a-half hours, the equivalent of an entire movie, to the tale of Lisbeth Salander), I will recommend the Director's cut wholeheartedly. It makes all three movies five star offerings---at the very least.",1297900800,,2472,5.0763546798029555

If you didn't read the last book, I can understand the not being completely engrossed in watching the latter.  I am looking forward to seeing the second movie, the Fire one.
I am curious as to an American make of the movies of the trilogy, since Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth completely.  I can't believe any casting is going to come up with anyone comparable to her.",1297900800,,681,4.603305785123967

4270099,5,B0046H0HZ6,This was a superb ending to a wonderful trilogy. The story of Lisbeth Salander is the best I have read in quite a long time.,1297382400,,124,4.0
4270100,2,B0046H0HZ6,"""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" is the third in a trilogy of movies based on the three  novels written by Swedish novelist Steig Larsson; the first two being ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""The Girl Who Played With Fire."" All three novels, were written by Larsson before being shown to a publisher and were released after his death. As, of course, were the three movies.

 Right off the bat, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" which was directed by Daniel Alfredson, is different from the first two movies, because in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" the bisexual/hacker/punk-rock heroine (or anti-hero if you like) Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Repace) had a huge dragon tattoo on her back, and in ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" Salander, does in fact, set her wicked father Alexander Zalachenko on fire, scaring him for life. But in the ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" there is no hornet's nest, not did I hear any reference to a hornet's nest, or even a single hornet. I didn't read the novels, so there may have been a reference made to a hornet's nest there, which doesn't help, or explain the reason for the title of the movie, except that the producers must have felt the need to be true to the written trilogy.

 So much for the nitpicking about the title. The movie is even more confusing.

 ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" is by far the least  interesting and least exciting of the three movies.  In the first two movies, Lizbeth Salander is a piece-of-work, scheming, fighting and sometimes even torturing people. But in ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" Salander spends the first half of the movie under arrest in a hospital bed, recovering from the injuries she received at the end of  ""The Girl Who Played With Fire,"" caused by her father, who she finally managed to kill, and her half brother Ronald Niedermann, who looks like Ivan Drago from the ""Rocky IV.  The thread that kept the first two movies flowing was the bond between Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist). Yet in ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"" the two don't even meet until the last five minutes of the movie.

 The movie starts with Salander in the hospital, recuperating from her wounds, while a group of evil old men, led by a lying son-of-a-cockroach doctor, try to have her either jailed for the murder of her father, or committed to a mental institution for the rest of her life. While Salander wallows in bed, Blomkvist and his sister (who is Salander's lawyer) try to figure out a way to save Salander and put the cranky old men out of business, whatever that business may be, because it certainly isn't clear in the movie. Then there's Salander's trial, where she goes from wearing drab hospital garb, to donning a weird punk/rock leather costume, with her hair piled up in the middle of her head, looking like a female version of  Edward Scissorhands on steroids.

 The only excitement in the entire movie is when Salander catches up with her menacing half- brother Niedermann. After escaping his death clutches in a warehouse, Salander somehow manages to acquire a nail gun, from thin air no less, and from behind, nail Niedermann's feet to the floor. This scene, which is supposed to be frightful, is actually funny, because Niedermann has an affliction where is his incapable of feeling pain. So instead of screaming, writhing and trying desperately to extricate his feet from the wooden floor, Niedermann looks  mildly quizzical and greatly confused, as he shuffles his feet slowly, and not too desperately. Salander then phones a biker gang, who have a score to settle  with Niedermann. They supposedly finish him off, which we don't actually see. That was very disappointing, because seeing Niedermann whacked would have added some excitement and finality to a very dull movie.

 I gave ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" 5 out of 5 stars. And I gave ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" 4  out of five stars. The best I can do for ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" is a very weak 2 stars, and only because Noomi Repace is a riveting actress, who deserved a better screenplay than she was given in this thoroughly disappointing movie.

4270101,2,B0046H0HZ6,"This movie is quite a disappointment. If you haven't read the books, you will be lost and wondering why the movie was made at all. The story is disjointed, moving in all directions with out a purpose.
If you have read the books, it is a unmitigated disaster. Film makers must condense a story to work with the attention span of the viewers, but here they have torn the soul out of the heroine and castrated Micke. We no longer see the hacker coordinating her defense, we only see hints. Mikael drives the investigation, but with no understanding of how or why.
All the subplots are cast aside and the secret service investigations and the characters are tossed in the story at random with no background to give context.
The worse part is the ending- in the book, we see the growth and new found trust that develops in Lisbeth. In the movie, all we get is a fumbling, unspeaking, unappreciating social misfit. Lisbeth has not been freed from her prison, she has moved back in and redecorated.
While I understand the film's emphasis on the court room and trial- for we see a little of the old Lisbeth here, this story required the background of activity and support found in the investigations of Mikael, the secret service and the machinations of the group.
In the books, Lisbeth is a part of the story- a raging river rampaging through a complex environment of forests, mountains and towns. In this context, the river's interactions with the environment it tears through are just as important as the river itself. In this movie, the director seems to have forgotten this.",1297296000,6,1571,4.675090252707581

While Lisbeth continues to be a real kick butt heroine, I was not as revited by this plot as I was for the first movie. All of the information in this movie was revealed in the second one. The court room drama was boring at best.  That man knew that the DVD existed in the first installment. There was no shock or major twist for the audience.  The back story of who and what her father was versus getting the information to the public-was boring as well.  Maybe if there were scenes of the public outcry or something.  Fights scenes were untentionally funny.  Cops that take a full minute trying to get their guns out of their holsters--assault weapons being flashed and fought over in a restaurant and there's no reaction from the diners for a full minute until the bullets fly and then they just duck.  Killers who appear to have heartattacks during a job and a brother who watched Terminator 2-too closely. And why wasn't there an active seach being conducted for the brother?  Over all, I found the film boring and my having to force myself to sit still instead of doodling or writing a groceries list.  The first movie, I couldn't turn away--this one (and even the second one) fell flat.",1297123200,3,1358,4.396
4270103,4,B0046H0HZ6,"It is neccessary to judge ""The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" in two entirely different contexts.

This is also a hard movie to review since, if you have seen the first two movies, I do not want to spoil any aspect of suspense or surprise.

In  a nutsell, what this movie is about is that Lisbeth, the subject ""girl"" has been falsely accused of murders (that arose out of the previous two films) by the very same forces that have been abusing and tormenting her for her whole life. Her torturers have also, ironically, become instrumental in becoming her legal persecutors. The essence of ""Hornets Nest"" is how will Lisbeth fare in court and how will a [so called] neutral tribunal judge her? Who and in what ways will she be assisted in her defense? To tell anymore would constitute spoiling the movie so, therefore, I am purposely being vague about the story and characters.

It would be illogical to see this movie without first seeing the other two since to watch ""Hornet's Nest"" on it's own will certainly make the naive viewer apathetic towards the characters and be lost in the (what will appear to be) conviluted story. These movies are much more than sequals, they are total continuations of each other.

As a film on it's own, ""Hornet's Nest"" is a complicated and intriguing courtroom drama that fully satisfies anybody who has watched the first two movies. This movie addresses every issue and gives a resolution that is exactly what each character had coming to them. It provides an intelligent finality to the ""saga"".

""Hornet's Nest"" is not a perfect movie and it is definitely not as good as ""Dragon Tattoo"" which was a masterful mystery/suspense film. It's not it's fault since it inherits some of the silly and unbelievable melodrama from ""The Girl who played with Fire""  and now, dealing with it's inherited characters (like the man who feels no pain) there is a responsibilty for story resolution.

The movie moves very slowly and it meticulously addresses important issues such as the ""Millenium"" newspaper, character's origins and the Swedish court system. That is a very positive thing since what distinguishes this Swedish trilogy from the usual Hollywood junk is the more cerebral nature of the story and how the films are directed.

As a conclusion to the trilogy, it is excellent since the movie addresses all issues, provides fitting exoneration and retribution.

The ""Lisbeth"" character is compeletley amped up to where she represents the antithesis of her, old world-European villains. Her rebelious nature is milked to the maximum especially in the context of a stodgy court room.

The Blomkvist character is fully blossumed since he finally gets to demonstrate his sense of journalism and what his investigative talents may accomplish.

If you evaluate the three films, then it is inevitable to rank one film over another (I rank this better than ""Fire"" but inferior to ""Tattoo"").  However, I would imagine that anybody that enjoys the ""Dragon Tattoo"" film will ultimately see all three movies, for completeness. Viewing all three films together and reviewing them in their totality of circumstances, this is an excellent, extremely satisfying trilogy with ""Hornets Nest"" being a perfect ending.",1297036800,,3230,4.992551210428306
4270104,2,B0046H0HZ6,"The denouement of the Larssen trilogy is not simply (as the movie states) that everything will be revealed. It is also, at least in Larsson's books, marked by a shift in the protagonist Lizbeth Salander, a shift towards trust and beginning movements of friendship. This shift is entirely downplayed in this movie, which is more interested in showing the Goth/Punk makeup of Salander than her growing, adult sense of who to trust and how to trust. Further, Erika Berger is portrayed as a whiny coward, which she most certainly is not in the Larsson books; and Armansky's role is almost completely omitted (which makes Berger's call to his security agency instead of the police bizarre). Plot lines are hopelessly conflated and none of the characters is fully developed.

If the Larssen books were too long to put on the screen, the film-makers would have done better to follow the leads of the Harry Potter films and divide the third book into two rather than hopeless butchering the two strongest women characters in fiction in a long time.",1297036800,7,1040,4.875706214689266

I also really hated the way the character of Erika Berger was portrayed in all three films, but this one was definitely the worst one. She's supposed to be a very tough character, and in the movies she comes across as a total wuss. Finally, the courtroom drama at the end of the film is SO much better than in the book. I was disappointed they didn't do a better job. Still, fans of the book will enjoy it very much. The good stuff outweighs the mediocre.",1296950400,,754,4.3546099290780145
4270106,5,B0046H0HZ6,"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is part conspiracy story, part courtroom drama and all thriller.  As the many threads originally spun in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and further woven in The Girl Who Played With Fire complete their pattern, Lisbeth is recovering from three gunshot wounds.  Jail and a murder trial await, along with the possibility that she will be committed for life to a mental institution.  Fortunately, she has friends.  The iminimtable Michael Blomkvist, the hacker Plague, her former boss at the security company, and the sympathetic doctor who protects her from the police and the evil Teleborian all rally round and provide Michael's sister Annika the evidence she needs to defend Lisbeth at her trial.

In my opinion, this is the best movie of the three and a most satisfying conclusion to a unique series.  Once again, perfect casting, excellent screenwriting and non-stop action make this movie an edge of the seat experience.  While some events in the book were changed a bit to suit a film, the difference aren't noticeable, and the movie flows beautifully.  As before, Noomi Rapace is the perfect Lisbeth.  Her inner tension and outer defiance are so spot on, that even when she's silent, as she mostly is in this film, her thoughts are as clear as if they were in a thought balloon over her head.

All the exposition for Lisbeth Salander's character was laid out in the first two movies--her back story, brilliance, eccentricities and the brutal abuse she suffered at the hands of Swedish welfare--so if you missed those, you're out of luck.  It's tragic that there will be no more Millenium stories, but they've certainly been interesting, both in the books and on the screen.",1296950400,,1718,4.889655172413793

In the third book, there was A LOT of detail on the secret society and its players.  Some people really like that, but I thought it dragged the story and the action did not pick up until about 70% into the book.  This movie, thank goodness, deftly left out those details without getting us lost.  I also appreciated that they left out the majority of Erika Berger's story.  In doing this, the movie moved at an excellent pace.
I've said it in my other reviews of the first two movies, but I cannot emphasize enough about Noomi Rapace's depiction of Salander.  She makes the films!!",1296864000,,713,4.566929133858268

Photography is excellent, as is the acting. Top quality filmaking. The two main characters are offbeat and appealing. There is a welcome absence of 'beautiful movie stars.'

However, the whole story line of the three part film is confused and way too complex. Part I, taken by itself, is a better work of art than the trilogy.  I have not read the novels and do not know if the confusion is in the books also, but the logical structure of this 2.5 hour Part III, and of the three together, is a mess.

4270110,5,B0046H0HZ6,"YOU CAN'T KILL Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth Salander. You can shoot her, bury her, but sure as the sun rises, she's gonna come back. Has there ever been a heroine like her? That's hard to say since Lisbeth tends to wipe the mind of other contenders as she strides onscreen.

I might be one of the few in America who has yet to read Stieg Larson's Millennium Trilogy. At first this was an oversight and then deliberate after watching Rapace's performance in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (2009). Now that the Swedish film trilogy is complete, I'll mend that situation.

It's obvious that Larson's writing touched a gigantic nerve and nearly every review I've read about the films has fretted over how the movies can't match the books. That's usually the case in such profound work. My goal was to see if the movies could stand on their own - and, for the most part, they did. Rapace certainly created a perfect, on-target response as an adult survivor of extreme abuse.

""Hornet's Nest"" picks up right after ""The Girl Who Played with Fire."" Barely alive, Lisbeth is ushered to the hospital. Even while surgeons fight to save her, police make plans to have her arrested - and The Section and her newly discovered sibling (Micke Spreitz) arrange her death. A subplot circles around the dirty business of sex trafficking, a story that Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) and the Millennium Group are planning to publish. However, it gets lost against Lisbeth's peril. Without giving much away - to others who may not have read the books - this third film is a suspense charged finale to the story that began in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" While most action comes through investigation and conversation, it's 2-plus hour run time never lags.

Cinematically, ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" looks better than the first two, especially on Blu-ray. The cool Swedish palette sets the tone for ugly acts and revelations. Detail is good as images appear out of the dark - even in daylight. I've found less chilling atmospheres in would-be horror films. When Lisbeth appears in court, we can see every link and stud, every crease in her full body armor. She looks like a punk Roman warrior goddess.

The compressed Dolby Digital soundtrack earns points as the dialogue comes through clean and sharp. Ambient sound is excellent for the subtle resonance of city noise, the frisson of presence in another room, and the echo of water and rats in abandoned buildings. Good stuff, especially on the Swedish/English dubbed track. The English dubbed track is not quite as stimulating.

Sadly, there are no extras except a glut of previews. Two hours of bonus features are planned for the 4-disc boxed set available Feb. 22. I hope we'll also get an extended release. All three films were originally made for Swedish television; each was cut by an hour for theatrical release. Wouldn't it be great to see the whole effort?",1296086400,,2913,4.816

""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" ends the Millenium Trilogy, sadly, on a sour note.  This is most likely due to two things: the source material and the way it was adapted.

The novel is a taut blend of political thriller and courtroom drama, in which the side characters from the previous two books are fleshed out and take very active and central roles.  There are a lot of side stories within, all of them contributing in the end to the central plot.  It's the Dickensian installment of the trilogy, in which Larsson's view of the world becomes populated with real characters aside from the central players.

It also makes for difficult adaptation.  Off the top of my head, I can name seven different ""side"" characters and three subplots in the novel that were left out of the movie.  I understand the necessity for condensing the story into its primal elements to avoid a four-hour film - but the end result is a ""streamlined"" hash that never quite comes out right.  There are huge leaps in the logic of the movie, and while I understand that there always are, there were far too many convenient plot points that either just happened or were just assumed by the characters in dialog.  As a result, there is a plenty of buildup and setup, but they always feel disconnected from the payoff.

Neither the political thriller or the courtroom play out satisfactorily in the film.  There is simply too much left out for an effective movie.  A good example is the trial scene, in which the existence of ""The Section"" is simply explained away.  Nothing is really made of it - it's just becomes a minor part of a trial, which, with the aid of ""just in time"" bollocks, conveniently fixes everything with very little dramatic tension.

Ultimately, there's little reason to watch ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest,"" unless you simply need closure from the the events of ""The Girl Who Played With Fire.""  If you've read the all of the novels but also enjoyed the first two films, the film of ""Hornet's Nest"" is entirely skippable.",1296000000,6,2059,4.677777777777778

4270118,5,B0046H0HZ6,"""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" is a terrific film, a perfect end piece for the Millennium Trilogy. I was transfixed during the whole movie. I have seen all three films now, and they are all extremely well-done. In my case I saw this movie first, and will now read the book. I did that with the second in the series, and it proved to be, for me, the best way of going about it.
Lisbeth Salander is near death. She is in the same hospital with her sadistic, evil father. There is a vivid operating sequence in which they remove a bullet from her brain. She makes a slow recovery with the help of her very skilled and loyal, young personal doctor. She is going to be tried by the prosecutor for the assault on her father, and she is also targeted by a large rogue outfit operating out of the Swedish intelligence service. They are a very large element in this film. It's like a Le Carr  thriller.
Meanwhile back at the Millennium magazine Mikael Blomkvist and the staff are doing everything possible to save Lisbeth from legal traps. In this movie both protagonists share the screen, but from afar in separate equally engrossing sequences.
The movie is in Swedish with English subtitles, but it is very easy to follow. The cinematography is outstanding. The scenes of Stockholm and Sweden are stunning.
Lisbeth is extremely strong mentally and physically. She is brilliant, but emotionally her father and other men have crippled her, and she lacks the ability to really love and to say a simple thank you, although she struggles to do so. Her lawyer, Blomkvist's sister, Advokat Annika Giannini is very shrewd and competent, and the doctor is a very sympathetic figure.
The evil psychiatrist, Dr. Teleborian, is a sexual abuser who kept her as a child restrained in an asylum for months. He is very much her enemy and wants to get her back in his clutches again. She is also pursued by her step-brother, the blond giant who feels no pain and who kills mercilessly.
Every actor in this film deserves high praise for their acting skills; Noomi Rapace is the perfect Lisbeth, and Michael Nyquist is the ideal Blomkvist.
Knowing how American movie makers can ruin a brilliant series like this, I do not look ahead with anticipation to the coming American versions. For me these three films are the sine qua non of an authentic redition of novels.
Right up until the end you will be mesmerized by this film. Friends who have read the book attest to its faithful rendering, and as a moviegoer I can attest to its cinematic strengths. Now that I have seen all three films, I see them as one united tapestry whose threads come together luminously. There's a gripping pursuit scene near the end which recalls the suspense of the second movie. It's the story of a victim who overcomes her victimhood but only after paying a very high price.",1293321600,11,2836,4.626984126984127
4270119,5,B0046H0HZ6,"This is truly the case where a movie is better than the novel on which it is based. Stieg Larsson's novel is complex, wanders, has whole lines of drama that don't add to the story (Erika taking a job at another publication is a prime example). It is still a fine work, but pretty tough to read in places (I sometimes skipped whole scenes involving the unraveling of the conspiracy by the small unit that ended up overseeing Zalachenko).

In the movie, the story line about the governmental unit that ended up protecting and working with Zalachenko is much cleaner. So, too, the powerful trial scene. In the book, the trial scene is long, Salander's attorney appears to me to be given way too much latitude, Teleborian's testimony seems interminable. The movie tightens this up considerably--without compromising the power as the scene concludes in the novel.

In short, a satisfying conclusion to a powerful trilogy of movies (originally conceived as a TV series). Noomi Rapace continues her extraordinary run as Lisbeth Salander. She even smiles broadly! Of course, in character, it is when she learns that her father, Zalachenko, has been killed. Kind of chilling as you watch the scene play out. She also features a handful of ""crooked smiles,"" as Larsson describes them in the novels. The team at Millennium, led by Erika Berger and Mickael Blomkvist, work to exonerate Salander and speak to the misuse of government power used to throw her into a mental institution when she was 12.

Her final confrontation with her half brother is very much in keeping with the novel and quite satisfying, including how she takes care of the motorcycle gang while using them for her purposes of vengeance. Well done indeed! Other highlights: Salander's use of her handheld to access the Internet while in the hospital, Plague's taking on a more central role (a rather unlikely ""hero""), Salander's neo-Rocky sequence in which she exercises while in prison, her play acting in the trial as she Goths out (or whatever the term is), her final meeting with Blomkvist as the movie closes (I think the novel's ending was superior). Other pluses: Blomkvist's sister's role as Salander's defense attorney; Teleborian's demise; the more complete picture of Erika's and Mikael's relationship.

The movie is long, coming in at about 2 1/2 hours, but it doesn't seem to drag. There is not always a lot of action, but the story line seems to move ahead quite nicely. This movie, also, suffers less than the first two for not providing key information (How would one know that Palmgren, in ""The Girl Who Played with Fire,"" was her former guardian before the evil Bjurman?).

At any rate a most convincing conclusion to the Millennium trilogy. And, alas, unless the partially written fourth novel by Larsson as he died before completion can be filled out and made to work, this is the last we shall see of Salander and Blomkvist and the full cast of characters.",1292716800,,2935,4.885542168674699
4270120,4,B0046H0HZ6,"Most people who see this film are probably already well familiar with the story surrounding Lisbeth Salander, the unlikely ""heroine"" of the trilogy by Swedish author Stieg Larsson.  Director Daniel Alfredson, who also directed The Girl Who Played with Fire, apparently also assumes this, as he spends little time giving background, instead showing quick cuts of a few scenes from the two earlier films and allowing Lisbeth's background to unfurl through her trial for murder. Beginning the film at about the halfway point of the final novel, Alfredson also omits most of the danger represented by her father, Alexander Zalachenko, a Russian defector who is trying to kill her in the hospital where they are both patients recuperating from life-threatening injuries.  Zalachenko (Georgi Staykov) has only a cameo role here.

For much of this film, actress Noomi Rapace, as Lisbeth, does not speak, instead conveying information through her facial expressions, allowing the viewer to see up close just how good an actress she is and how much she can convey with the blink (or lack of a blink) of an eye.  Lisbeth is certainly a disturbed individual--angry, unable to trust anyone, reclusive, and no stranger to using violence to solve her problems--but much of this behavior is a result of her institutionalization and the physical and sexual abuse by virtually all the men which whom she came in contact as a child, including the care-givers assigned to her by the state.

When Lisbeth is finally released from the hospital for trial, Rapace plays the role to the hilt, and her close-ups in the courtroom are stunning--her eyes going dead, her slight grimaces, her blank expressions, her palpable vulnerability.  Represented in court by Mikael Blomqvist's sister Annika Giannini (played with wonderful subtlety by Annika Hallin), she appears to be everything that the uncompromising legal system abhors, and she does nothing to help herself.  As in the past, Michael Nyqvist plays the role of Mikael Blomqvist, the caring writer/publisher of Millenium Magazine who wants to help her.  As he and the staff of  Millenium investigate the circumstances surrounding Lisbeth's assignment to a mental institution at the age of twelve, and the accusations of abuse which she has made, the contrast between their commitment and active involvement in her future and the lack of affect that she shows toward her own future is dramatic and moving.

Unlike the previous films, there is very little dramatic violence here, though Lisbeth's confrontation with her giant brother Ronald Niedermann (Micke Spreitz), who is unable to feel pain, is one of the film's high points.  There are no graphic sex scenes, and the only sexual abuse is done off-camera.  The Swedish setting--and the mood--are dark and cold, paralleling the life of Lisbeth Salander.  The final scene, subtly different from the novel, consists of Lisbeth uttering one word--a word that had as much long-term dramatic effect for me as the word ""Rosebud"" does in Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. Ultimately, the viewer feels a kind of peace at the end of the film, a sensitive and satisfying conclusion to this trilogy.  Mary Whipple",1291680000,12,3179,5.159533073929961

4270122,4,B0046H0HZ6,"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is the final film in the Millenium / Dragon Tattoo triology.  I'm not going to say much about the plot as it will only make sense if you've seen the first two movies, and if you haven't seen the first two movies, then anything I say would amount to 'spoilers' giving plot details away. So what I will be saying will mainly concern what makes the movie worth seeing and how well it wraps everthing up.

First and foremost, what makes the movie worth seeing is Noomi Rapace, the incredible Swedish actress who plays the title character in all three films, Lisbeth Salander. I've never seen any actor or actress who could communicate so much with a single look or stare, which is important in this film as Lisbeth spends the first half of the movie in a hospital bed, recovering from the beating and bullet wounds she received in the previous film, and is barely able to talk. If there is any justice at all, Rapace should get an Oscar nomination for this final performance of the character, to go with the recognition she has already received in Europe for her performances.

The other actors are all good in their roles, though given the nature of the film they're not given as many opportunities to shine as they were in the previous two.  Michael Nyqvist is solid as the reporter Mikael Blomkvist, but the one that I would say stands out the most is Lena Endre as Millenium's editor and Blomkvist's sometime lover, Erika Berger. Endre does a very good job of portraying a woman whose strong professionalism and convictions are brought to the breaking point by escalating threats coming at her from the shadowy organization Millenium is investigating.

As to how well Hornet's Nest wraps everything up, this is the only reason I gave the film four stars instead of five, though in truth it isn't really the creators' fault. It's the age-old problem of trying to condense a highly detailed book into a two-plus hour movie. On the plus side, the film does in fact tie up all of the plot ends, at least sufficiently to satisfy the viewer's curiosity as to how all of the principal characters end up. To accomplish that, however, there is a considerable amount of glossing over of plot details. This won't bother anyone who's already read the books, but to anyone who hasn't, there are a number of places where the viewer is left scratching their heads wondering why some of the characters do the things they do. This is most noticeable in the last part of the film dealing with Lisbeth's half-brother, the pain-insensitive hulking thug Ronald Niedermann. Within the film, Lisbeth, for some completely unknown reason, decides to go - alone and unarmed - to a remote abandoned factory owned by her father, where for another completely unknown reason, Niedermann happens to be. It feels clumsy because it is, but it was also arguably the only way to wrap up Niedermann's plot thread.

The extensive glossing-over aside, the film does work quite well as a thriller as you watch the two sides - the Millenium staff and a government investigation team working to save Lisbeth versus the shadowy rogue covert operations group working to put her away or kill her - working against the clock to thwart the other side.

I highly recommend this film, but _only_ if you've already seen the first two as otherwise most of it will make little sense. And again, it's worth seeing not only to close out the trilogy, but to once again see Noomi Rapace turn in another - and final - performance as the enigmatic but resourceful and relentless survivor Lisbeth Salander.",1290816000,,3586,4.7006369426751595
4270123,4,B0046H0HZ6,"As this film, the final installment in the Millennium trilogy, begins, (SPOILERS AHEAD) Lisbeth Salander is in a hospital, recovering from the bullet in the head she got at the end of part II. Soon her father (the Ukrainian mobster who tried to kill her) is dead, but nevertheless she remains on the run from his minions, especially the blond monster who was shockingly revealed to be her half brother at the end of the second part. One could argue that the Millennium trilogy is a metaphor or indictment of the rottenness of Swedish society, but the first movie worked (the best in the trilogy by a long shot) as a very exciting action movie with a compelling mystery. If that first part was a great, gripping film, Millennium II was not without qualities, but also somewhat disjointed and confusing. Millennium III give us the loose ends in the first two parts, and is much better than II, though not up to the first movie. It can be confusing at the start, and for much of the running time it has the look of a condensed miniseries, as if several hours were resumed in two and a half. Also, I found that the long trial scene, while explaining much of Lisbeth's motivations, was a drag to watch. Fortunately, the final fifteen minutes make a very satisfying end to the trilogy. One reason the final two installments were not up to the first is that they were shot by a different director: Niels Oplev is clearly a much better director than Daniel Alfredson. But the ending redeems this movie, making it worthwhile to see.",1290816000,,1523,4.582417582417582
4270124,5,B0046H0HZ6,"The third story in the Millennium series begins precisely where the second ended.  Lisbeth is taken to the hospital.  Shot three times and buried alive, she needs emergency brain surgery to remove a bullet.  Her father is still alive and her half brother is still on the prowl.  Eventually Lisbeth is transferred to a Stockholm jail where she awaits trial for attempted murder.  In this story we learn the big backstory--not just Lisbeth's relationship with her father and half brother, but the relationship between Lisbeth's father and a secret security unit, unknown even to the Swedish prime minister.  These characters are anxious to remain anonymous.  That means eliminating witnesses (or, in Lisbeth's case, consigning her to an asylum, permanently).

Here's what to keep in mind.  You should not pay any attention to film critics who fail to perceive the film's genre.  Just because there are three books in the series, with a repeating cast of characters, you should not expect all three of the stories to be the same.  The first story is actually a 'locked room' mystery (a locked island mystery, to be precise).  The second story is very plot-driven, with far fewer atmospherics and the flavor of action/adventure.  The third story is quite different.  This is a legal thriller.  The 'complaint' that Lisbeth spends half of the film in the hospital and the other half in court is unfair.  Hey, this is Lisbeth.  Do you really think she's going to sit idly by and not play a pivotal role in her own defense?  And besides, we have the posse to end all posses: Blomkvist and the Millennium team, Lisbeth's former employer at the security agency and last, but most certainly not least, her hacker pal, Plague.  They are supported by Blomkvist's sister, who serves as Lisbeth's defense attorney, and a whole security team, investigating the secret security team.  There's plenty of conflict here between good and evil to satisfy any viewer and as the camera shifts from good guy to bad and the layers of Lisbeth's defense case are assembled, the (more cerebral) plot is riveting.

Finally, I don't want to give anything away, but trust me on this--Lisbeth is not going to be in the hospital or the court room forever.  Her crazed half brother is still at large and he's got some serious 'splainin to do, except that Lisbeth may cut that discussion short, in a way that only Lisbeth could conceive and execute.  The final scenes are, shall we say, very, very memorable.

As always, the direction is superb, the acting pitch perfect and the ending more satisfying than I could express (without spoiling it for all of you).

Given the genre and given what the film aspires to do, this is the top film in the series.",1290470400,133,2717,4.816414686825054

The third entry in Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium"" Trilogy comes to a terse and somewhat disappointing end with ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"".

We begin where the previous film ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" ends with Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace, still fascinating and compelling) recovering from the bullet wounds inflicted by her father, the notorious former Soviet spy ""Zala"" (Georgi Staykov, continuing his understandably ""ticked off at life"" performance). His son, Lisbeth's half-brother Ronald (the hulking Micke Spreitz) seeks to kill Lisbeth. But forces beyond their control intercede as Lisbeth is put on trial for the attempted murder of ""Zala"". This trial is backed for ""security"" reasons by a select group of government agents known as ""The Section"".  Another branch of the government wants to expose ""The Section"" and work with Lisbeth's erstwhile lover and committed journalist Mikael Blomkvist (a dour, yet effective Michael Nyqvist) seeking to free Lisbeth with help from Mikael's sister and just-happens-to-be-a-lawyer Annika Giannini (Annika Hallin). Throw in Lisbeth's former doctor who treated and abused her as a child during her stay in a sanitarium and you have one, full 2 'n 1/2 hour film.

If this looks somewhat convoluted, you're correct. Although to be fair I had little trouble following which group was which and what they were doing. Still, the idea of following around groups of old Swedes is not as exciting as it sounds.

The main flaw with the film the is the straight-forward and uninspired direction from Daniel Alfredson who fails to imbue the story with enough suspense or intrigue. For what it's worth, he does manage to tie all the loose ends together in a reasonable way, though I did find one huge plot hole which happens near the end of the film concerning Lisbeth's half-brother, who's been on a killing rampage throughout and is sought by every policeman in Sweden. His ""hideout"" should be quite well known by the authorities, yet somehow it is not being watched. Even if this is in the novel, I found it unacceptable and distracting.

There are some enjoyable and compelling moments in ""Hornet's Nest"", almost all of which center on Lisbeth. Noomi Rapace's performance is so strong that it will be a tall order for the upcoming ""English language"" films to compete with. Another small, but fine performance is turned in by Lisbeth's computer-hacker friend ""Plague"" (Rolf Deigerlung) who has lost some weight since the first film.

Perhaps the first film in the series ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was so enjoyable and entertaining that the follow-up films couldn't help but pale in comparison. Add to that the fact that author Stieg Larsson had planned a 10 novel series, only to pass away after completing the first three means we can only guess at what might have been.",1290297600,4,2862,5.076595744680851
4270126,4,B0046H0HZ6,"Not since The Lord of the Rings has a cinematic series based on a book series been this satisfying. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the completely fitting conclusion in the film set based on the now enormously popular book trilogy from the late (great) Steig Larsson. The film opens in the hospital as our offbeat heroine is being operated on from injuries sustained at the end of the second film, The Girl Who Played with Fire. The 'girl' of course is Lisbeth Salander (played by the Oscar-worthy Noomi Rapace), and this final film works to solve the mystery of ""The Section"", the group out to kill Salander and anyone else who gets in their way.

The film is nearly 2 1/2 hours long, but after the first half an hour or so, the rest of the movie flies by. Where the first two movies were action packed thrillers, this one changes pace and spends more time forwarding character development and tying up all of the mysteries opened in the other two. This has bothered some critics, but not me - I thought it was brilliant. The acting is exceptional, and not just from the leads. This movie has some great supporting characters as well. And while this is a slower film opposed to the others, it still has some top notch suspense and one ""jump"" scene that trumps any others in the series.

If you haven't seen the other two, you don't want to start here. The trilogy is very closely connected and you need to go in order - starting of course with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I am so sad that Larsson passed away, because I really want more Lisbeth. I haven't read the book series yet, and that's next on my ""to-read"" list.",1290211200,4,1634,4.425249169435216
4270127,4,B0046H0HZ6,"This is a fine wrap up of the story but its the only one I wouldn't recommend to someone who hasn't seen the others.  Lisbeth finally receives justice but that's not all.  For no apparent reason, she's no longer the extraordinarily unlucky person who manages nothing more than survival.  This time, nearly everything goes her way, which is great but a little hard to believe.  The other thing that never quite translated for me is why Mikael the reporter never seems scared.  By now, he knows what he has gotten himself into and still he plods along as if he and his staff are untouchable.  Then again, I suppose there wouldn't be much of a story otherwise.  This all leads up to a thoroughly enjoyable, but less than explosive conclusion.  Without giving too much away, Lizbeth does have a final showdown with Big Whitey but after 3 installments I expected no less than a re-staging of James Bond's fight with Oddjob, not just some fancy footwork.",1290038400,,948,4.668674698795181
4270128,3,B0046H0HZ6,"[Contains spoilers of the previous installments ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""The Girl Who Played with Fire""]

In ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" Lisbeth Salander, now hospitalized, faces another battle - this time in court. There are some people out there, trying to exercise power over her, those who want her to be silent forever. Also, murderous Neidermann is still looking for her. Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist working for the magazine ""Millennium,"" plans to exonerate Lisbeth by uncovering the complicated web of intrigues and conspiracies, and enlisting a help from his sister Annika Giannini, a lawyer to defend Lisbeth.

The final installment of the Millennium trilogy is well-acted, but lacks the tension that the first Millennium film offered to us. Characters talk much, maybe a bit too much, slowing down the story. In fact, most characters don't have much to do. The courtroom drama is not very interesting, and its showdown is incredible and too good to be true. The film has several nice action scenes involving guns and killings, but most of them have little to do with the main story.

Noomi Rapace is very good as Lisbeth, one of the most unique heroines in cinematic history. Her interaction with the hospital doctor is brief but convincing, but most supporting characters are not fully fleshed out. The most disappointing part of the film is that she spends most of her screen time apart from Mikael Blomkvist. Their unlikely but intriguing team-up in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is nowhere to be seen in the third chapter.

After all the greatest mystery of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy is the character of Lisbeth herself. Now that we know pretty much of her back story, which explains (if not completely) her anger and distrust, Lisbeth becomes less interesting. The third chapter doesn't add much to what we already know about her and those men surrounding her. It is a bit sad that we have to see her story finished in this way.",1289779200,16,1985,4.916417910447761
4270129,3,B0046H0HZ6,"Now that the third film in the ""Millennium"" trilogy has been released, it seems like the right time to take a look at all three films. Since this story was always conceived as a trilogy, it seems difficult and premature to talk about each individual film. Yes, they can each be pulled apart and critiqued, but without the knowledge of what happens in all three films, how is it possible to determine if an individual character's story arch is complete, or if the beginning, middle and each are satisfying. Quite simply, the first two films don't really have an end.

Larsson helps with this, providing fairly conclusive stories in each segment.

Written as three books, author Stieg Larsson unravels an epic, violent, complicated look at the life of a young woman, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace, soon to co-star in ""Mission Impossible IV""), is given the raw end of the deal by a group of men trying to cover up a very big political secret and they have made her life a living hell.

In fact, graphic is another good one word description for this film. I tried to read the book and just couldn't get into it; the Swedish names made it difficult for me to become involved in the story. Just as I was about to try again, the first film was released. As America was working its way through the trilogy, I had the opportunity to read a new book by Hanning Mankell, the other famous Swedish novelist. Strangely, it is also very graphically violent, much like this film (and from what I understand, the book). It seems odd two different works would be similar in this way. Does this point to a trend in Sweden?

I am glad these films were originally made in their native Sweden. Honestly, I don't see how Hollywood will retain the graphic, violent nature of these stories. Hollywood is uncomfortable depicting sex and when you throw violence into the mix, it almost never makes it to the local multiplex. I don't see this happening in the American remakes, but if any director can capture this feeling, this mood, it is David Fincher who is already directing the first film of the trilogy.

Ultimately, each film can be summed up with one word. Mystery. Revenge. Retribution.

The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo

We are first introduced to Mykael Bloomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), the editor of a small political magazine called Millennium; it may be a small publication but Mykael wants it to be the next Rolling Stone, all of the political reporting he can accomplish with the huge readership of a more popular magazine. Mykael prints allegations about a famous Swedish businessman who then sues him for libel. Mykael loses and, in an effort to save the magazine, decides to distance himself from the publication. And he is also scheduled to serve a prison term beginning in six months, so he has to find something to fill the time. He agrees to meet with a semi-reclusive elderly businessman in a remote part of Sweden. Fearing he will die soon, the industrialist wants Mykael to find his niece who has been missing for forty years. Everyone else in the family has long since decided she is dead, but the uncle has his doubts. Mykael is intrigued and agrees to help.

Early in the investigation, Mykael realizes someone has hacked into his laptop and becomes intrigued. Eventually, he learns Lisbeth is the hacker and she is also the investigator who looked into his background at the behest of the businessman he is now working for. Recognizing she has a unique skill set, he asks her to help him in the investigation.

Lisbeth is not your ordinary young woman. Tough and determined, she has learned a lot on her own and decided she will no longer suffer abuse at the hands of the men who control her life. A ward of the state, she uses Mykael's mystery as an opportunity to escape the realities and horrors of her life.

During the investigation, they crisscross the Swedish countryside looking for clues, slowly unraveling a complicated and graphic mystery spanning many decades.

In ""Dragon Tattoo"", Mykael and Lisbeth seem to share the story, working together, helping each other through their respective stories. We also learn a little about each of their back-stories.

The Girl Who Played With Fire

The one word to describe ""Fire""? Revenge.

Now that Mykael's life is more or less back to normal, Larsson moves the focus to Lisbeth. As the layers of her life are revealed, we move deeper into this story and realize how twisted and bizarre her upbringing has been. For too long, people have been the cause of the trouble in her life and she has now decided she can't and won't take it any longer and sets out to extract revenge on the people who are responsible.

As she begins this quest, Mykael seems all but forgotten which is strange. Given the nature of their relationship as established in ""Dragon Tattoo"", you would expect him to be more important to this story, more present, more involved. Instead, we see and hear of him working in the background. He pops up occasionally, but this is Lisbeth's story now. Because of Lisbeth's independent nature, her upbringing and the fact so many men have treated her so badly, the fact she becomes a lone vigilante fits with her character. But just because it is true to her nature, doesn't make it more satisfying to the viewer who wants to see more of her former partner.

Much like ""Dragon Tattoo"", ""Fire"" doesn't really end, it seems to pause temporarily and then the credits start. The filmmaker is being as true to the source material as possible, allowing for the next chapter and the next film. Even so, this film seems anti-climatic and less concerned with story. The film is all about Lisbeth tracking down her father and half-brother and each of them beating the heck out of each other.

That said, when ""Fire"" ends, you might breathe a sigh of relief because you get a break from all of the violence.

The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest

One word to describe this entry? Retribution.

Picking up exactly where ""Fire"" ends, after getting severely beaten and shot a number of times, Lisbeth hangs onto life by a thread. A helicopter flies her to a hospital and she receives emergency treatment. Then, she must mend and recover from a coma.

This gives us a chance to get reacquainted with Mykael. He is determined to create a special issue of Millennium, providing the details of Lisbeth's life and exposing the conspiracy behind her treatment. He enlists the staff to rundown leads and obtain proof. Mykael wants to expose all of the corruption, all of the cover-ups, everything contributing to her treatment.

As Mykael works to uncover the truth, the people behind the cover-up are just as determined to keep things secret. Two of the men responsible, now retired and waiting to die, watch the events unfold and decide they must act. As far as they are concerned, there are two problems, Lisbeth and her father, Zalachenko, both of whom are recuperating in the hospital. One of the retired men, barely able to breathe, pays a visit to the hospital and meets with Zalachenko first. Things don't go well, they get noisy and panic ensues. The plan is to take care of both Lisbeth and her father, but Lisbeth's lawyer, Mykael's sister, manages to keep her safe.

These shadowy government officials and Lisbeth's former psychiatrist, the truly evil Dr. Teleborian continue to try to get to her, but they are thwarted by a number of people and Lisbeth makes it to the trial.

As Lisbeth's trial begins, Mykael continues to work tirelessly to bring the next issue of Millennium to print. But the same shadowy figures learn of his plans and work to stop him as well. At any cost, putting Mykael and his staff in danger.

The trial is an interesting piece of filmmaking. Basically, we watch everyone lie about Lisbeth. Then, when Lisbeth takes the stand, she recounts her story, describing what we have already seen. This should be a fairly boring piece of storytelling; film is visual, so watching people describe things and events, especially something we have already witnessed, should be boring. But this portion of the film is strangely impactful. Part of the reason for this stems from the fact we have witnessed all of this before. Lisbeth has been treated so brutally, so indifferently, so poorly by everyone in her life that we have to question whether she will make it through the trial and if she will be convicted of the charges sending her back to a psychiatric hospital. It could go either way. In fact, if the trial were to go against her, it would be more in keeping with the rest of the story. Also, because we have witnessed all of this, we root for her. We want her to be victorious. We want and need her to win the trial.

""Hornet's Nest"" is too long and I have to think Larsson could have easily written four books. Maybe he originally intended to do such a thing but got cold feet, a trilogy is more common, more acceptable than a quadrilogy. Lisbeth's recovery and Mykael's investigation should be the third film. Is it even necessary to sit through Lisbeth's trial? At least depicted in the same level of detail? No.

The ending feels tacked on, like the author felt there needed to be one more confrontation. It just isn't necessary.

Then, there is another bit of business and this scene feels anticlimactic. Much like the previous two films, the narrative simply ends and the credits roll after a brief shot of a city from across a bay.

""The Millennium Trilogy"" is an interesting, necessary film experience. The filmmaker's earn points for depicting the brutal life of a young woman, in an honest, explicit way. Lisbeth and Mykael are interesting and vivid characters. And their on-screen relationship is also pretty great.

But the mystery of ""Dragon Tattoo"" doesn't play a part in the next two installments. Connecting this to Lisbeth's history or Mykael in some personal way would have helped give their story so much more resonance. Really, the first film only serves to introduce us to the main characters and paint a little of the back-story.

In the following two films, Lisbeth's back-story takes center stage. In ""Fire"", everyone seems to be trying to kill everyone else; one confrontation after another and it starts to have an effect on you. This effect isn't necessarily a good one. When ""Fire"" ends, you may breathe a sigh of relief.

""Hornet's Nest"" seems more like a recap. It's good. It holds your interest. But a lot could have been trimmed, giving the film a faster, more exciting pace.

""The Girl..."" is imperfect, but still a must see for mystery fans.",1289433600,3,10553,4.724156692056583
4270130,3,B0046H0HZ6,"""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was somewhat disappointing in that the minutiae of the case gets boring.  The two original leads have very little interaction.  That is what spiked the chemistry in the previous two movies.  Just too much revenge in this story -  and much much talk.  The story can't help dragging because of the complications from her father's murder and intricate details of the infiltration of spies at Sweden's highest level of government.",1288656000,2,465,4.987012987012987
4270131,5,B0046H0HZ6,"I just watched this movie and this movie blew me away with its faithful and suspenseful adaptation of the last novel in Stieg Larsson's Trilogy.  Noomi Rapace is simply riveting and outstanding in her definitive portrayal of Lisbeth Salander -- there's no way a remake can match her searing & intense performance.  Lisbeth Salander is confined to her hospital room or cell in the first part of the movie -- she does not express herself verbally but by the way she looks at people.  Lisbeth Salander is a very interesting character whom the audience roots for because she is an extremely capable young woman who is a strong fighter and survivor. She cares about and fights for justice to be meted out to those who abuse women.  She went through so much crap and mistreatment at the hands of authority figures in her life, but she is able to overcome all these difficulties due to her intelligence, resourcefulness, and capabilities.  We come to understand her antisocial behavior.  In this film, we get to see more of a glimpse into the relationships that Lisbeth develops with those people who come to her aid and who genuinely care about her well-being.  This movie is appealing because it talks about healing from abuse and oppression and the fight for seeing justice being carried out.

Daniel Alfredson did a great job of faithfully adapting the book to film.  Even though I knew the outcome by reading the novel, I was riveted to the screen;  this movie was very suspenseful and dramatic.  A lot of things in the book are portrayed and explained --  more details of Lisbeth's ordeal at age 12 in the St. Stephen's Psychiatric Ward under the care of Peter Teleborian,  what happens to Lisbeth as she's recovering from the wounds she suffered in ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"", Mikhel Blomkvist's (and the staff at Millennium) effort to publish Lisbeth's side of the story,  what happens to Zalachenko/  Zalachenko's ties to the section in the Swedish government and their effort to bring down Lisbeth, a glimpse of the key people that come to Lisbeth's aid,  the pivotal courtroom trial where Giannini (Mikhel's sister) ably defends Lisbeth, and what happens to Lisbeth's brother.  Suffice it to say, that this film, like the book, ties up all the loose ends of the Trilogy into a very satisfying conclusion.

The section in the book which I wanted to see the most portrayed in the film was the dramatic courtroom trial -- the book devotes several chapters in great detail to this trial and the film does a great job of portraying the essential aspects of the trial and its outcome.

I felt this third part of the Trilogy was just as good if not better than the first one, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  You'll watch this movie and cheer.  Very satisfying and highly recommended!

DVD Features:

Sadly, the DVD features are meager.  The only bonus features are the English language dub track and a theatrical trailer, nothing else.  I wished there were featurettes and commentary to the movie, but there are none.",1288483200,40,3021,4.763461538461539
4270132,4,B0046H0HZ6,"I jumped on the bandwagon for the Millenium trilogy a bit later than everyone else. I didn't even get around to seeing the first two films until the middle of October 2010, but once I did I was completely hooked. I had to see how this brilliant trilogy would end and that's where The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest comes in.

The film is mostly a game of tug of war between the older men who have come out of retirement in The Section and the writers who are risking everything by posting a story that puts them in harm's way at Millenium magazine with Lisbeth's disturbing past tangled up in the entire thing. The greatest element these films share is the fact that they introduced the world to how fantastic Noomi Rapace really is. Her presence alone is so mesmerizing it almost seems like a bonus that The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is superbly written, as well.

What's strange is the film spends most of its duration discussing the ins and outs of the law and the rest of its time in the court room yet still manages to not only keep your interest, but also be incredibly engaging. Maybe it's because everything comes together from the first two films or that even during its slower moments, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest features fascinating events like the loudest and most unexpected breaking window ever, qualified and intellectual individuals being into kiddie porn, and ingenius use of a nail gun. The Millenium trilogy offers a compelling cast and an intriguing story that is emotional at times, brutal at others, and vengeful in between. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is both a fitting end and the cap on a brilliant franchise.

The only downside to the last two films in the Millenium trilogy is that they don't feature the chemistry between Blomkvist and Lisbeth like it does in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. It's mostly due to the two characters being split up nearly the entire duration of both sequels and (according to other sources) that's the way it was in the books, but still it only makes you wonder. If another film was made featuring these two characters teaming up again and spending most of the film on-screen together yet strayed away from the novels, would it be as good as the original film? Probably not since it doesn't have a solid novel to fall back on, but fans can dream.

As spectacular as The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the last scene felt a bit abrupt like there should have been more of an emotional exchange between Lisbeth and Blomkvist. It made it seem like everything was resolved other than the relationship between these two central characters. Maybe it was done on purpose to leave room for them to return for potential sequels. I didn't read the books, but maybe director Daniel Alfredson was just trying to stay as close to the source material as possible. Nevertheless, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is an extremely well written and enthralling finale that lives up to the rest of the Millenium trilogy while tying up all the loose ends, but like its predecessor falls shot of being as powerful and enjoyable as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.",1288224000,3,3142,4.615384615384615
4270133,4,B0046H0HZ6,"""The Girl Who Kicked A Hornet's Nest"" is really more like ""The Girl Who Played With Fire Part II"" -- this movie begins mere minutes after the end of the previous one, and everything stems from the film before it. The third and final film adapted from Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is a taut, unnerving exploration of a government cover-up -- with the titular ""girl"" as their victim.

Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) has been shot in the head, and is rushed to a hospital for surgery -- the same hospital as her evil father Zalachenko. And since she's still being framed for murder, Mikael (Michael Nyqvist) devotes the forthcoming issue of ""Millennium"" to clearing her name and revealing the government's dirty secrets (including how they had her institutionalized as a kid).

But when Zalachenko threatens to rat them out, the ""Section"" sends an assassin to shoot him. Unfortunately, this group also wants want to punish Lisbeth by sticking her in another mental home, and the pedophile director Teleborian is all too happy to lock her up. The best chance Lisbeth has is to send her own ""autobiograpy"" to Mikael.

It's not a whodunnit, and it's not a straight thriller. ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" is a slow-moving, complex affair, centering on powerful men who try to crush women who defy them, and a system filled with in corrupt muck, cruelty and murder. It's part legal drama, part conspiracy story, and part bloody thriller.

And while not as harrowing as the movies before it, this movie is a bleak tangled web of threats, evidence,stalkings, and the occasional gory death (along with the hysteria that accompanies them). As the story goes on, it tauter and frightening, buoyed up by Lisbeth's impassive defiance (she walks into her own trial in full goth-punk regalia!).

The one flaw? The last fifteen minutes feel disconnected from the rest of the film, and the last scene feels... anticlimactic, and vaguely unfinished. Then again, since Larsson intended to write ten books, perhaps the ""unfinished"" flavor is inevitable.

Rapace is silent for long stretches of the story, and her impassive face, deep eyes and leashed energy make her a presence even when she doesn't speak. Her Lisbeth is full of defiance against the world, and it can only be seen through her dress and her silence. Nyqvist is good but rather overshadowed by Rapace; Anders Ahlbom is wonderfully vile as Teleborian --it's INCREDIBLY satisfying to see the pedophile get torn apart.

""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest"" ends on a ""to be continued"" note that will never be continued, but it's a satisfying end to the tale of Lisbeth Salander.",1286755200,3,2640,4.9324324324324325
