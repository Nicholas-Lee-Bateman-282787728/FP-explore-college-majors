8455266,3,B0053IBKPI,"This movie, which I have been wanting to see for some time (Clancy Brown fan), was exceptionally well done on a number of counts.  The acting was wonderful.  The production and cinematography on this indie film were top notch as was the score.  There were many moments in the film that were effective and well-observed.  The problem?  I really don't know what happened and how the movie actually ended.  Had he imagined the entire thing?  Why the flash forward 3 years.  Did his girlfriend die?  What did the ending  shot of him alone in the desert indicate?  I would have rated the movie higher if these really basic questions had been answered.",1395705600,,646,4.678571428571429

8455268,1,B0053IBKPI,"If you have a hard time falling asleep, buy this DVD - you won't regret it. You'll be asleep before it ends. The only way to see how it ends is to fast forward to the last 10 minutes and you will still not know what the plot is about. Even if you manage to keep your eyes open throughout the entire DVD.",1343174400,,303,3.8253968253968256
8455269,4,B0053IBKPI,"A thoughtful independent film about a man (JP Allen, the writer and director) who's lost his girlfriend late one night in Vegas.

As the security officer for the casino interrogates him, he flashes back on his relationship with her - and with other women he's known. The film is thoughtfully composed and fairly formalist in tone (though not so much as to detract from the progression of the story). It slowly reveals this man's psyche, both in how he deals with women, communicates with them (not too well), and his increasingly obvious gambling habit that may depend upon or inform his subsequent actions. The girl isn't the only thing he may lose tonight.

Taking place over the course of a couple of hours late one night in a Vegas hotel, ""Gambling"" is a psychological piece that is well written (almost too written in that is is very ""writerly"" which isn't a terrible thing), and not really driven by the mystery as much as you might expect. Rather, it's a study of character and of place (physical and mental). There's some mileage gotten out of possible foul play the girl might have encountered, but the movie's heart ultimately isn't in this particular tack. Likewise a gigantic bet that may or may not be placed.

The film doesn't suddenly reveal any surprises, explaining what makes these people tick. It doesn't ""cheat"" that way. Instead it merely observes them, apparently stuck in habits, in this point in their lives. There's a well-done fascination in this well-observed piece.

For what it does the pace is perfect. Nicely acted and it looks good (shot on various gauges of film, a nice change of pace from most low-budget indies these days). At 89 minutes a very confident and small character study, a couple in Vegas, following (and victims of) fate, not for any reasons except that that's the way they are and that it is. And in a way, that's a more tragic fate than what befalls them - foul play, lost bets, whatever.",1308268800,,1938,4.724852071005917
