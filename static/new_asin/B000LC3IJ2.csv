2701678,5,B000LC3IJ2,"This set includes a vast array of ladder matches...I'd strongly recommend this set for those, like me, that want DVD quality of rare matches (like the HBK vs. Bret Hart ladder match; previously only available on tape)...

This set is dynamic in that it shows a different side of wrestling,evolving it along the way, and how that side itself has evolved...compare matches from the beginning of the set (i.e. - Hart vs. HBK) to more recent ones like Nitro vs. Hardy.  Whereas in the past the ladder was just used as a gimmick and the matches were effectively a normal wrestling match with the rare ladder spot, nowadays the match itself is competition to upstage a previous ladder match (some times more wrestling occurs on the ladder than in the ring)...

To those complaining about certain matches lacking the reason is simple:  WWE has released many of those matches multiple times on DVD (HBK vs. Ramon from Wrestlemania X for example)...if you want those matches, look for them on other sets (Wrestlemania Anthology and HBK's Inside the Vault)...other's were truly that good (most ECW ladder matches were garbage matches...with a ladder thrown in)...

This, along with the steel cage DVD set ""Bloodbath"" truly shows how WWE can put forth an AMAZING collection of themed matches...

A big recommendation to order it...",1181088000,,1320,4.950226244343892
2701679,5,B000LC3IJ2,"I pre-ordered this a while back and somehow got it in the mail yesterday, 3 days before its release date. Lucky me, hell we're all lucky to see all these matches. For me personally, it was a chance to see the classics (like the TLC's), matches I haven't seen in years (Smackdown's TLC, RVD vs. Guerrero), and matches I've never seen period (4 way tag team match at Armegeddon, Benoit v. Jericho at Royal Rumble).

I've seen maybe half of all the matches so far, and I'm constantly picking my jaw up off the floor. So many highlights, I won't even bother to go into detail. Clearly, the is THE best dvd has ever put out, bar none.

My only gripe is the very first match, Jake Roberts (he's not even ""The Snake"" yet) v. Big Daddy Ritter (aka, Junkyard Dog). It's probably on here for nostalgia, to see these guys early in their career. Not a fun match, watch it once, then pretend it never happened. One of the funnier things I  noticed on the Shawn Michaels/Razor Ramon match is an advertisement for Shawn's sunglasses and his poster, only 21.99, sadly the 800 # is blurred out. I have a feeling Vince will eventually put out some WCW stuff b/c their match on here is outstanding.

Anyway, stop reading this and start watching the dvd..",1180828800,2,1235,4.451327433628318
2701680,5,B000LC3IJ2,"this has matches that surpass the wrestlemania x and 16 matches. if you want the wwe to make every one of the ladder matches ever made on a dvd set, then the set would be 5 to 10 discs long and a hefty price tag with it.

sorry that the wwe thinks that ecw and wcw matches suck but remember they where enemies at one point and why would the wwe want to live on with those matches that remind you of those organizations? wcw and the orignal ecw are dead. if you don't like this selection then try to find a better one

wwe, keep up the good work",1180051200,2,544,3.9363636363636365
2701681,5,B000LC3IJ2,All those matches listed below are fantastic and I guess there on the DVD because that is what the kid said. There is only one thing that I would change though. If you include every TLC match then you should also include every Money In the Bank Match. And just as a side note why no ECW ladder matches?,1179878400,,302,4.135593220338983
2701682,5,B000LC3IJ2,"It's amazing how a simple concept for a match (climb up a ladder & grab the belt) has spawn so many memorable moments in the history of professional wrestling and WWE picked out a wonderful collection of matches here to illistrate how the ladder match has spawn off so many memorable to classic moments in wrestling & was also the catalist for so many versions of this match including TLC, Stairway To Hell in ECW, and King Of The Mountain in TNA.

North American Champion Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter (Junkyard Dog) - This was joined in progress and it was using a one sided ladder with the referees holding it steady while the wrestlers climbed up. Nothing special past the historical factor.
Stampede Wrestling '79

Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - Two years before the more famous ladder match between Shawn & Razor Ramon would happen at WrestleMania, the very first ladder match in WWE history happened here. Both men went away from their usual strategy in matches of wrestling & were brawling more with Sherri becoming a distraction from time to time. The ladder was used as a weapon here with Shawn ramming it into Bret while Shawn was later given a slingshot into it. It wasn't anywhere near the standards of this type of match today but the purpose here was just to show the concept of the match which it did achieve.

[Greatest Rivalries: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels]

Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon - The ""forgotten"" rematch from WrestleMania X that was very different than their previous encounter as the ""behind the scenes"" story about this match was revealed years later in that they weren't allowed to use the ladder as a weapon here.  Razor took the fight to Shawn by first suplexing Shawn from inside the ring straight to the floor & then focusing heavily on his leg after pushing the ladder down causing it to be trapped inside the ladder followed by punishing it by stomping on his leg wedged in the ladder & dropping Shawn onto the ladder leg first.  Shawn was able to dish out the punishment himself by back-suplexing Razor off the ladder &  throwing him so hard into a ladder in the corner that he flipped over the top rope while also using the ladder to execute big moves like a moonsault & an attempt at a big splash but unfortunately was also on the receiving end of a Razor's Edge off the ladder.  A second was brought into play leading to one moment where both men fell off the ladder & crotched on the ropes.  I'm glad they put this one on here as it didn't disappoint & lived up to the hype & expectations based off their previous ladder match.  As a side note, if you want an idea of how comical WWF was back in '95 then watch Shawn Michaels entrance when they have a guy trying to sell you his merchandise at ringside (ala Home Shopping Network).
SummerSlam '95

Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Triple H - Just a couple of notes before the match but the DX band played Triple H & Chyna to the ring, The Rock debuted a new version of his ""Nation"" theme while Mark Henry was in Rock's corner, and Triple H was coming into the match with a bad leg based off an attack earlier in the night.  Both men started out in the ring before the brawl continued into the isleway with Triple H being thrown into the ladder leaning against the ring.  Triple H swinging it into Rock followed by driving it into his ribs before Rock recovered & went right to work on that bad leg with stomps & elbow drops before using the ladder to wedge the leg & stomp on it along with using a chair to hammer the ladder into Triple H's leg.  Rock was ruthless by dropping Triple H onto the ladder leg first before Triple H was catapulted & backdropped onto it various times before Rock eventually dropped a People's Elbow with Triple H on the ladder.  The Rock & Triple H just have that natural chemistry that carries over into each match & this was no different in a classic quality match that told a great story.

Edge & Christian vs. New Brood (Hardy Boyz) - This was the not only the first tag team ladder match in WWE history but also the finals of a series of matches between both teams called the Terri Invitational Tournament (which allowed Jerry Lawler to have so much fun with the initials) in which the winning team would gain an amount of money & her managerial services.  Gangrel was ejected from ringside early on in the match allowing this match to be straight up between both teams with them having so many highlight moments such as Jeff being backdropped over the top rope all the way to the middle of the isleway, Christian giving Jeff a reverse DDT off a ladder, Edge powerbombing Matt off the ladder, Jeff's missle dropkick off the top rope knocking Edge off the ladder followed by a swanton bomb on the ladder, Christian on the receiving end of a legdrop off the top rope from Jeff who leapfrogged over a ladder in the process, Jeff Hardy being a handyman by breaking a ladder & then fixing it, Edge & Christian delivering a baseball slide with the ladder into Matt's crotch, Edge receiving a neckbreaker off the ladder, and all four men ""crashing & burning"" off the ladders.  This was the match that put both teams on the map that would eventually plant the seeds for the future series of ladder/T.L.C. matches featuring various members. Since this was the first tag team ladder match, it was non-stop action & never a dull moment.

[Hardy Boyz: Leap Of Faith; Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - This was the first ever T.L.C. match which is the same concept as a ladder match except tables & chairs were also legal & encouraged to be used as well while it should also be noted that this was a homecoming for the Hardy's with them being from North Carolina.  You had various crazy moments with all three weapons being legal such as Edge legsweeping both Devon & Matt off ladder, Bubba powerbombing Christian off a ladder, Edge pushing Jeff off a ladder that caused another ladder to catapult into Matt's face, Christian getting a 3D through a table, Edge hitting everyone in sight with a chair, Christian launched into Edge who was sandwiched in between a ladder, Jeff's swanton bomb off a ladder through tables, Bubba going off a ladder in the ring through stacked tables on the outside, Lita getting involved & paying for it, Matt falling backwards off a ladder out of the ring through tables, and Devon & Jeff hanging from the tag titles.  This was a ""car crash"" that took your breathe away.

Shannon Moore & Shane Helms vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang - It was during this period in WCW that the crusierweight division had the most focus on it than it has in over a year with all six of these men stealing the show every chance they had but this match was different in that although it's setup as a three team ladder match, the one person who grabs the contract at the top would receive the title match against Crusierweight Champion Chavo Guerrero who also joined in on commentary for this match.  This match had it's moments full of crazy spots & moments like Yang dropkicking the ladder into Noble & Evan followed by Kaz doing a moonsault onto the ladder with both underneath, a botched backdrop on Kaz that caused him to land on his head instead of the ladder, back to back to back various dives from the ring to the outside with Noble being shoved off the ladder onto everyone on the outside, another ladder being brought into the match to be made a scaffold where Evan caught Kaz & powerslammed him off of it, Shane Helms with the ""world's highest neckbreaker"", and Shannon Moore's headscissors taking Yang off the scaffold to the floor.  If you only know these guys from their runs in WWE then you don't know what your missing as this match was the match of the night at that PPV as it was the crusierweight division that was saving the WCW product at that time. It wasn't as crazy as the T.L.C. matches in WWE but these guys put on one hell of a performance in what many consider the last quality Starrcade match in the history of the event.
WCW Starrcade '00

Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho - Chris Jericho came into this match with a bad arm which Benoit targeted right away only for Jericho to initially be able to counter the attacks but Benoit went to work after Jericho missed a springboard dropkick by throwing Jericho into both the steps & ring post shoulder first.  Jericho was able to get to the ladder first & used it to his advantage by ramming it into Benoit's face & ribs but also ended up in the receiving end of a ladder attack being thrown into the ladder face first onto the floor before Benoit then attempted a suicide dive but caught a chair to the head mid-air.  Both men continued to take hard hits with the ladder as they connected with it face first at various points such as Benoit dropkicking the ladder into Jericho's face before he would later feel the effects of a modified Walls Of Jericho on the ladder before Benoit would knock Jericho off the ladder into the crossface.  This wasn't your ""car crash spotfest"" type of ladder match more than it was an aggressive brawl with the ladder used as a weapon more than anything else.
Royal Rumble '01

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - The rematch from SummerSlam here at WrestleMania except this one also including each team's associates (Spike Dudley, Rhyno, Lita) getting in the action as well.  You got all the crazy spots as expected here such as Bubba powerbombing Jeff onto Edge through a table, Christian falling off a ladder in the ring straight to the floor, Spike Dudley delivering a dudley dog off the apron through a table on the floor, Rhyno giving a gore through a table, various loud chairshots to the head, Jeff Hardy doing a swanton bomb off the highest ladder through a table & later attempting to walk on the ladders like a tightrope, Matt & Bubba falling out off the ladder through the stacked tables at ringside, and the highlight reel of Edge spearing Jeff while he was hanging from the tag titles that WWE used in promotional videos for years after this match.  T.L.C. II followed the same patterns as their previous matches in that this was full of ""Holy S..."" moments one after another.
WrestleMania X-7
[Hardy Boys: Leap Of Faith]

T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - This match is known as the ""forgotten T.L.C."" for various reasons such as Edge not acknowledging this match when he kept saying ""I never lost a T.L.C. match"" along with the fact that it happened last minute on broadcast TV instead of how the previous matches were built up on TV for months leading to the PPV.  Various highlights include Jeff having a ladder thrown at him in the middle of Poetry Of Motion, Benoit snap suplexing Bubba onto the ladder, Jericho bulldogging Bubba off the ladder, Walls Of Jericho on the top of the ladder, Edge & Christian pushed off the ladders onto the outside, the Hardys being hiptossed & suplexed off ladders, various chairshots to the head & people falling through tables, a Twist Of Fate off the ladder, Edge's spear off the ladder, and Benoit's diving headbutt that injured him causing him to miss action for a year.
""SmackDown"" May '01

Intercontinental Champion Christian vs. Edge - Two of the men who are known for reinventing the ladder match now go at it in that same match they made famous that made action both in the ring along with the outside & through the crowd.  The ladder was used as a weapon various times like to cause damage to the ribs like a baseball slide, Christian crotched on it, a catapult into Edge's face, being slammed off the top rope onto it, setup as a scaffold on chairs leading up to a big top rope splash, and Edge getting his receipts on all the acts Christian did to him over the past two months.
No Mercy '01

Intercontinental Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam - ""The Battle Of The Frog Splash"" continues & after their previous two encounters, the score would be settled in a ladder match.  Both men had various spots & moments such as Eddie whipping RVD face first into the ladder followed by targeting his legs using a chair & the post, RVD's moonsaults onto Eddie on the ladder, Eddie taking punishment like having the ladder dropkicked from under him followed by a tilt-a-wirl backbreaker onto the ladder & Rolling Thunder on the ladder, and Eddie's sunset flips off the ladder into a powerbomb & cannonball.  This was very fast paced & intense from start to finish and was without a doubt one of the best matches on WWE TV for that year.

[Eddie Guerrero: Cheating Death, Stealing Life]

WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy - Despite Undertaker being in WWE for over a decade at this point, this was his first ever ladder match against one of the masters of this match.  Jeff brought the fight to Taker doing everything he could do including a chairshots to the head, legdropping the ladder on top of Taker, and using dirty tactics like a low blow.  Taker brought the pain using the ladder to his advantage like knocking Hardy into the announce table, using a chair multiple times himself, and legdrop on the apron with Hardy ladder the ladder.  The story behind this match was Undertaker just delivering a beating to Jeff Hardy who just refused to quit & give up...to the point where Taker just had to do what he had to do after the match.
""RAW"" July '02

T.L.C. Match: World Tag Team Champion Kane vs. Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba & Spike Dudley vs. Chris Jericho & Christian - They advertise Hurricane for this match but he wasn't in it due to Ric Flair & Triple H attacking him before the match causing Kane to defend the tag titles alone.  This was a ""car crash"" as you would expect here with such moments like Bubba's airplane spin with the ladder, Spike being tossed into RVD, the ladder catapulting into Christian & Jericho's face, Hardy's legdrop on Kane through a table, Jeff being caught in midair into a powerslam, the Van Daminator & Van Terminator, Christian launched off top rope into ladder, Bubba delivering a superplex off the ladder, Spike being shoved over the top rope onto the table, and back to back Bubba Bomb & 5 Star Frog Splash.  High spots & moments all over the place along with high impact moves to the point to where Bubba Ray suffered such a concussion that he doesn't remember the match to this day.

[RAW: 10th Anniversary]

Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs. Christian - These two were feuding with each other for months over Trish Stratus but after going through regular matches, handicap matches, and cage matches (where Christian injured his back & was out of action for months) they settled their score in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship after Edge had to forfeit the title due to injury.  Both men started out wrestling before it turned into a brawl in the crowd & the outside using the cable cord to choke while Christian was able to do his Unprettier on the floor.  The ladder then came into play with both men being thrown into the ladder, ladder using it as a weapon like Jericho using it to work on Christian's back while Jericho's leg was damaged when thrown into it, and making moves more impactful like the Lionsault & bulldog, and both men taking face first falls from the ladder & even from the hanging title.  This match was more about trying to tell a story throughout the match instead of doing a bunch of ""high spots"" & turned out to be a great match.
Unforgiven '04

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane vs. Edge vs. Christian - This was the first ever Money In The Bank match where the object of the match is to grab the briefcase at the top that contains a contract to challenge any World Champion whenever he sees fit in the next year.  As expected with a multiman ladder match, chaos all over the place with everyone going after Kane on the ramp before the bell, everyone diving on top of everyone else on the outside, Benoit crossfacing anyone in sight, Benjamin splashing Edge in the corner on the ladder, everyone fighting on 3 ladders at once, Edge T-Bone'd off the ladder, and Benoit's headbutt off the ladder that caused him to bleed from the head.  I was here LIVE & to quote Joey Styles ""OH MY GOD!"" The show-stealer here though was Shelton Benjamin as he looked like Spider Man with the majority of the moves he was pulling off involving the ladders. As a side note, watch Kane's intro because that was something to see with the ladders on fire.
WrestleMania 21

Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was similar to the Money In The Bank match where the object was to grab the briefcase hanging at the top but in this case, the briefcase contains custody papers of Rey's adopted son & Eddie's biological son Dominic.  Various moments include Rey being thrown into the ladder in the isleway, Eddie bringing in a second ladder before Rey baseball slide it into Eddie's face followed by a springboard seated dive onto Eddie on the outside, an attempted sunset flip powerbomb that had both men hitting the back of their heads, Rey on the receiving end of a hilo while he was sandwiched between ladders, Rey backdropped Eddie onto a slanted ladder than collapsed the ladder Rey himself was on, using the ladder to do a unique 619 & springboard legdrop, Rey taking an impactful powerbomb from hanging off the hook, and the 3 Amigos onto the ladder.  It was a great ladder match even though the storyline got stupid with the whole ""Dominic is my son"" thing going on...well, it did result in the ""I'm Your Papi"" shirt so I guess it's not all bad.
SummerSlam '05

Loser Leaves Raw/Money In The Bank Ladder Match vs. Matt Hardy - The final encounter between these two (three if you involve Lita) in this very personal feud against each other to the point where they dished out the most punishment possible & not hold anything back.  Both men took some hard hits & delivered them with the ladder such as Edge being squeezed in an upside down ladder scissors, Matt being either dropped into or back suplexed or hitting face first into the top or suplexed into the ladder stomach first, a sequence that starts with Edge being shoved off a ladder & ends with Matt crashing & burning off another ladder, Matt's crossbody off the ladder onto Edge in the crowd, Twist Of Fate off the top of ladders, and Lita getting involved along with weapons like kendo sticks & tables.  This was unlike their previous matches as a tag team where it was one spot after another as this was came off more like a fight that was very aggressive from beginning to end.
""RAW"" Oct. '05
[The Life Story Of Edge]

T.L.C. Match: WWE Champion Edge vs. Ric Flair - At this stage in Flair's career, this was a completely new environment for him as this was his very first ladder match in his hometown against ""the master of the T.L.C. match"" with his daughter at ringside.  Knowing how Flair suffered a concussion the week before, Edge targeted Flair's head by attacking it with the ladder & chair that ended up busting him open while also going after his back by putting Flair through a table & even delivering a supersuplex from the ladder.  Flair delivered just as much punishment as he recieved returning the chairshots & pushing Edge off a ladder through a table on the floor.  This match was more about ""how can Flair take this punishment as his age"" than anything else resulting in a very impressive performance from Ric Flair in this being his first time doing this type of match at this stage in his career.
""RAW"" Jan. '06

WWE Championship/T.L.C. Match vs. John Cena - Edge's had the heavy advantage going into this match as he returned home to a hero's welcome in Toronto as the WWE Champion defending with his own ""Rated R"" WWE Championship in the match he's the innovator & master of.  Edge showcased this fact by dishing out the punishment like giving Cena a DDT into chairs, dropkicking the ladder off the guardrail into Cena's face, powerslamming him through a table, running up a ladder to the top rope followed by a crossbody to Cena on the outside, a ladder to ladder spear, and Lita getting involved causing both men to crash through tables.  Cena himself gave as much as he took to Edge by hip tossing him into the ladder & later delivering his throwback into a chair, applying his STFU with Edge trapped in the ladder, FUing the ladder onto Edge, powerbombing Edge into the ladder, and giving Edge the biggest FU we've ever seen.
Unforgiven '06
[The Life Story Of Edge]

Intercontinental Champion Johnny Nitro vs. Jeff Hardy - This was Jeff Hardy's first ladder match since his return to WWE while this the first one in Nitro's career leading to such spots as Jeff's Whisper In The Wind that took as much out of Jeff as it did Nitro, Jeff's crossbody onto the ladder that Nitro was holding, Nitro's standing dropkick from the top of a ladder onto Jeff who also on the ladder, Hardy's swanton bomb onto a ladder, and a ladder being thrown so hard that it wrapped around the other's head.  This was the match for me that put Nitro on the map as a ""superstar of the future"" as he was able to hold his own & surpass the previous RAW ladder matches with the ladder match veteran in Jeff Hardy.
""RAW"" Nov. '06

WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. MNM vs. The Hardys - This was originally set to be just a regular title match between London & Kendrick before Teddy Long gave us a Christmas gift with two additional teams & making this a ladder match.  We all know what the Hardys & MNM can do based on their past so mix that with the daredevil style London & Kendrick adapted along with the fact that Regal & Taylor didn't look out of place with their mat wrestling style as well leading to such spots like Mercury dropped off the top of the ladder straight to the outside floor, various wrestlers backdropped & suplexed into & off the top of the ladders, Jeff on top of a ladder on the outside before Nitro kicked the ladder through the ropes causing Jeff to fall off & land on ropes waist first, Jeff's sunset flip powerbomb on Nitro, Matt having the ladders split from under him, and watch out for that SICK spot where Joey Mercury's face gets crushed.
Armageddon '06

WWE didn't drop the ball like they did with the ""History Of WWE Championship"" set & picked out a bunch of matches available on multiple DVD sets (without counting the monthly PPV DVDs) so you know you'll be getting more than your money's worth & they do acknowledge the history of ladder matches before WrestleMania X (which they've said was the first ladder match). The only ladder match I've seen that I wish was on here was the Judgment Day 2003 match between Hass & Benjamin vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri but you can't win them all. I highly recommend this.",1178755200,65,23260,4.537726838586438
2701683,5,B000LC3IJ2,"You guys are friggen idiots. Seriously. Of course WWE is going to keep putting out these DVDs, because millions of people like me are going to buy them.

This DVD is going to be awesome.",1178236800,,337,4.121212121212121

Despite the good variety of ladder matches, most wwe fans may not feel the need to really purchase this disc set since they probably already have most of the matches in this set. However, it is good to have a set with all the ladder matches together and to take a look back at wrestlers such as edge, the hardys, and hbk whose careers rose to superstar and ( in the case of shawn michaels ) even legendary status due in large part to the ladder match. This is a good disc set that any wrestling fan should check out.",1176854400,,614,4.203389830508475
2701685,5,B000LC3IJ2,"Really sucks that Todd Grisham hosts this great DVD package as he just isn't very good, to say it nicely. His humor falls flat and his timing seems off, which could also be the fault of the writers for the DVD.

-For fans who were hoping to see the Michaels v. Razor Wrestlemania X match will only get about a minute or so of clips, same goes for the Wrestlemania 16 Triangle Ladder Match between The Hardyz/Dudleyz/Edge & Christian, sucks about those two though. There are interviews done with Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, Edge, Gregory Helms, Chris Benoit, Kane, Shelton Benjamin, Ric Flair, Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury.

-Stampede Wrestling '79 for the North American Heavyweight Title, Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter (JYD): A bit of a shock here to say the least, not a very good one though. It's joined in progress about 5 mins. there's not very much action and what little is there is really dull. It's over shortly after that, with JYD winning the title. Like others have said watch once and forget it's one here. 3/10.

-I.C. Title Match, Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart: From a house show in Portland, Maine, the very first WWF ladder match is a good technical bout, with very few uses of the ladder. Bret goes shoulder first into the ladder, Shawn gets slingshotted into the ladder in the corner. The finish comes when Bret dropkicks Shawn off of the ladder over the top rope and out of the ring, Bret then climbs the ladder and grabs the belt to retain the title. 7/10.

-Summerslam '95, I.C. Title Match, Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon (Champion): Once again not their Wrestlemania X match, but the Summerslam '95 rematch. Both wrestlers put on a great show with lots of good spots throughout including Shawn taking a vicious hit when Razor suplexes him to the outside and Shawn's ankle hits the guard rail. Also the ladder gets pushed and Shawn falls and honestly looks like he blew out his knee. But even after that there's about 10 more minutes of great back and forth action and the finish sees Shawn counter the Razor's Edge, sending Razor to the outside, Shawn tries to grab the belt but slips and sets the ladder back up and grabs the belt to win. 10/10.

-Summerslam '98, I.C. Title Match, Rock (Champion) vs. HHH: Begins with the DX band playing Triple H along with Chyna to the ring and The Rock comes out with Mark Henry at his side. Some good spots include Rock continous working over of Hunter's knee, with a chair shot while Hunter's knee was wedged between a ladder. Also some great chair shots from Hunter to Rock, while Rock is under a ladder. The match itself is good, just not great but it does tell a good story of Triple H overcoming a heel Rock to end the Great One's title reign of almost 8 months. The finish comes when Chyna low blows the Rock and he falls off the ladder, which allows Triple H to climb the ladder and grab the belt for the win in. 8/10.

-No Mercy '99, Terry Invitational Tournament Final, New Brood (The Hardy Boyz) vs. Edge & Christian: The finals of the Terri Invitational Tournament, figure out the double meaning with that one. Starts out a bit slow, which is to be expected. Both teams use the ladders in many different ways. The crowd was way into the match especially after Christian ran up a ladder and hit a dropkick on Jeff while he was in the corner. It stuns me that Jeff is not severely injured after some of the stuff he does, especially when he leapfrogs the ladder and hits a huge legdrop on Jeff. Also when he jumped off the top rope, hit another ladder into the faces of his brother and Christian, ouch I say. Finish comes when Matt knocks Christian and Jeff off of one ladder but Jeff lands on another ladder knocks Edge off and grabs the money at the top of the ladder for the win. 9/10.

-Summerslam 2000, TLC I Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian (Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz: The best of the TLC's cause it was the first, plenty of great spots throughout this one, Jeff does his usual insane Swanton from the top of a ladder but crashes and burns through a table. It seemed like the Hardy's were on their way to winning in their home state of North Carolina but Edge and Christian were able to pull out the win in the very first TLC match. 10/10.

-Starrcade 2000, Shannon Moore & Shane Helms (Gregory Helms) vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang, winner gets a cruiserweight title shot: Great, great spotfest here, virtually nonstop action by all six men. Some of the spots include Helms hitting a huge swinging neckbreaker off a ladder, Karagis hitting a huge bodyslam off of a ladder. A sequence of flips and dives to the outside, by most of the competitors, that was very well paced. Helms and Moore both win when they pull down the contract, so both men receive a crusierweight title shot. 9/10.

-Royal Rumble 2001, I.C. Title Match, Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit (Champion): This was a hell of a championship match, both men worked so well together whether it was as partners or as opponents. There were plenty of good spots, including Benoit doing a suicide dive but getting a vicious chair shot for his troubles. There was also good submission wrestling as Benoit worked on Jericho's arm, but he came back applying a submission on top of the ladder to Benoit. Jericho knocked the ladder over and Benoit hit the ropes and fell to the outside, Jericho climbed to the top and grabbed the title to become the new I.C. champion. 9/10.

-Wrestlemania X-7, TLC II Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, The Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Dudley Boyz (Champion): Not quite as good as TLC I, but still delivered the goods. Loved the insane spear from almost 15 feet in the air by Edge to Jeff while Jeff was hanging from the belts in mid-air. Rhyno, Spike Dudley and Lita all make appearances to help out their respective teams with all three getting some punishment, like Lita getting the 3D, Spike and Rhyno getting hit with a Swanton by Jeff off of a big ladder. The finish is great as Rhyno pushes a ladder with Matt and Bubba on top of it and they crash through 4 tables on the outside. Soon after Rhyno helps E&C win the tag titles. 9/10.

-May 2001, Smackdown, TLC III Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho vs. Edge & Christian (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz: Geeat TV main event as these four teams mesh well and during this match Benoit does a headbutt through a table on the outside that would lead to his neck surgery just a few months later. Each team gets some great spots in and this ends with Jericho and Benoit taking the tag titles to become the new tag champions. 9/10.

-No Mercy 2001, I.C. Title Match, Edge vs Christian: For months there was tension building between the two brothers and it finally boiled over prior to this match as Christian was tired of living in his brothers shadow. This was more of a wrestling match with a ladder as they told a good story and did use the ladder in some good spots. Edge ends up taking this one which was expected and continued his singles push. 7/10.

-May '02, Raw, I.C. Title Match, Rob Van Dam vs. Eddie Guerrero (Champion): Great match, lots of uses of the ladder, another one that's hard to describe, better to watch. Rolling Thunder by RVD onto Eddie under the ladder was awesome to watch. RVD hits a frog splash then climbs the ladder to win the I.C. Title. 10/10.

-July '02, Raw, Undisupted Title Match, Undertaker (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy: This was when they tried to give Jeff a singles push and this match was his best showing in my opinion. Jeff comes so close to beating Taker, but the Deadman (or Bad A.. well anyway, as he was here) did good as well since this was his first ladder match ever. Jeff gives it his all, hits som good chair shots and had his hands on the title before getting chokeslammed off of the ladder and Taker grabs the belt to win. 8/10, afterwards Jeff wouldn't stay down and kept calling Taker back to the ring and eventually he got his hand raised by Taker much to the shock of the announcers and Jeff.

-October '02, TLC IV Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship: Kane & Hurricane (Champions) vs. RVD & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray & Spike Dudley vs. Jericho & Christian: Good one here that sees Kane shoulder the load for his team alone after Hurricane was taken out earlier in the night. There's some good spots, especially Jeff leaping off of a ladder smashing Kane through a table on the outside. However Kane would overcome all the odds to win the match and retain the tag titles. 7/10.

-Unforgiven '04, I.C. Title Match, Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Champion): Like the Edge/Christian match on this set, this one told more of a story but still featured good spots including one wear Jericho ended up falling and hitting the ladder butt first which looked painful. It was a well done match for sure. 8/10.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Christian vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kane: Money in the Bank Match-Wrestlemania 21: Good one here loved how Shelton ran up one ladder as it was laying sideways on another ladder and clotheslined Jericho who was at the top of the other ladder. Plenty of other great action as well.

-Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero-Summerslam '05 for custody of Dominick: I heard both men tore the house down with this match.

-Edge vs. Matt Hardy-Raw Homecoming: Raw returns to the U.S.A. network and these two had a great match, plenty of good spots.

-Edge vs. Ric Flair-Raw January 06 for the WWE Title: Great showing by both men, but especially Flair, who proved he can still deliver in the main event even at his age.

-Unforgiven '06, Match for the WWE Championship, Edge (Champion) vs. John Cena: Great main event and the match of the night. Continious major league pop for Edge as this is his hometown and even bigger heat for Cena, not as bad as One Night Stand from June though. The match is really good, especially considering it's Cena wrestling. Liked the early boos directed at Cena everytime he hits an offensive move on Edge. Cena does do good in this match actually, even FU'ing a ladder onto Edge and locking the STFU on Edge while Edge was trapped between the ladder. Edge has some great offense too as can be expected because he's been in plenty of these matches and he's only lost one TLC match, which was on Smackdown in Spring of '01. Lots of great uses of the hardware surrounding the ring. Lita comes in and pushes over the ladder with Cena on it, and he falls out of the ring through a table. However when she tries to help Edge again, she hits Cena with a chair and causes him to bump Edge off the ladder through two table laying outside the ring. Cena then FU's Lita and begins to climb the ladder. Great finish with Cena catching Edge and FU'ing him off the ladder through two tables and then grabs the belt for the win in about 25 minutes. 10/10. Cena didn't look too happy afterwards about what he did to Edge.

-Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro-Raw November '06 for the I.C. Title: Good one actually, shocked Nitro did so well in a ladder match considering he was only on the main roster for just over a year at this time. Good amount of high spots, grounding by both men using the ladder to take the legs away of their opponent. Jeff ends up grabbing the title to retain and win the match. 8/10.

-The Hardys vs. MNM vs. London & Kendrick vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor: Four Team Ladder Match-Armageddon '06: Whoa I mean, whoa, I cringe everytime I see Joey Mercury get his face busted open and his nose broken, when a ladder gets smashed into his face. Nitro on his own does well in the match and there's some funny moments with Taylor and Regal being afraid of heights and unwilling to climb the ladder when they had the chance. Also liked the exchanges between The Hardy's and London & Kendrick, it ends with Kendrick and London retrieving the titles in the blink of an eye to retain in this great hard hitting ladder bout. 9/10.

-On a side note I'm a little disappointed the TNN debut match with The Hardyz vs. Edge & Christian was left off as well as the RVD vs. Christian match from Raw '03, both were great matches and worth putting on the DVD, but otherwise its a good set to have in your collection",1165449600,15,12288,4.468123049487294

2701706,5,B000LC3IJ2,"One of the most transcendent gimmick matches in sports entertainment is without a doubt the ladder match. What started out as a simple concept - the only way for a wrestler to win is to climb the ladder and get the prestigious concept - has become a genesis of some of the most memorable in-ring moments in professional wrestling history. Who could ever forget Shawn Michaels' frog splash off the ladder on Razor Ramon? or Jeff Hardy see-sawing the ladder into the faces of Matt Hardy and Christian? Or Shelton Benjamin using a ladder as a ramp to deliver a clothesline? Or a Dudley and a Hardy falling from a 20-foot ladder through a stack of four tables? This 3-disc DVD set includes some of the craziest, most spectacular and unforgettable ladder matches of all time, matches that redefined, revitalized and reinvented the concept of the ""ladder match"" to ensure its longevity for years to come.

Quibbles over Todd Grisham's lackluster introductions (with several wrestlers making welcoming cameos) to these matches are understandable, but overall irrelevant. The question remains: do the matches themselves deliver? The answer is a resounding ""yes"". WWE really outdid themselves with this DVD set and their ingenious choice of matches. Sure, the set is missing a few treasures, but in the end, the quality of the product remains spectacularly high. Not only is ""WWE Ladder Match"" an exceptional introduction to the ladder match concept, but also one of the best wrestling DVD sets of all time.

Ladder Match for North American Heavyweight Championship and Cash
Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter
Stampede Wrestling, July 1979

-We kick things off with this obscurity from Stampede Wrestling in late 1970s. And it's little wonder why it is. The match is extremely slow and lethargically paced. In fact, it looks like it was severely edited, missing a few opening minutes. Even worse, they use a one-sided ladder, which means that an official has to hold it down for a wrestler to climb. This match works as an historical curosity. Otherwise, take a pass. (*)

Ladder Match for IC Championship
Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels
July 21, 1992

-Now we're getting somewhere. THIS, not the WMX match, was really the first ladder match in WWE history and it's a very good one. There are no devastating spots and very little unorthodox uses of the ladder as a weapon. It's basically a technical wrestling match with a ladder. Instead, the main drama is both men trying to grab the belt. Bret and Shawn are simply incapable of having a bad match and this match absolutely delivered in spades. Not one of both men's finest hours, but excellent overall. (****)

Ladder Match for IC Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon
SummerSlam, August 27, 1995

-As much as I love the WMX classic, I am so glad they included the SS1995 rematch here. Don't get me wrong. The original ladder match between HBK and Ramon is a masterpiece, but I love this match due to its amazing heat, emotional drama and brilliant psychology. The duration of the match is Ramon absolutely annihilating HBK's leg with the ladder, a tactic that Rock would perfect against HHH in the next match coming up. The only downside is the botched ending where HBK missed grabbing the belt a few times. Other than that, this match lived up to its hype and nearly equals the original. (****)

Ladder Match for IC Championship
The Rock vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley
SummerSlam, August 30, 1998

-An unforgettable ladder match and a transcendent one for the participants involved. HHH and The Rock had a memorable feud throughout the summer of 1998 (who could forget DX's parody of the Nation?) and this would end it. And boy, did it ended it in style? This match is HHH and Rock beating the living daylights out of each other with the ladder, with the Rock particularly torturing HHH's leg. The monster pop that HHH got when nabbing the belt remains one of the most memorable of all time and he became a star. The Rock didn't do too bad either as afterwards, he became one of the company's biggest stars. Hell of a match and a hell of a way to end the feud, the first of many to come for both men. (****).

Terri Invitational Tournament Ladder Match
Edge & Christian vs. New Brood
No Mercy, October 17, 1999

-Oh yeah, baby. This match, the first ladder match in a tag team environment, kick-started one of the best tag team rivalries of all time and set the standard for ladder matches to come. Edge & Christian and the Hardyz (or the New Brood) were two athletic teams with a cult following before this match came along and turned them into stars. Some of the today's classic tag team spots originated from here, which included a leapfrog legdrop from Jeff off the ladder, powerbombs, reverse DDTs and neckbreaker off of it and the infamous see-saw spot. Even to this day, there is not an ounce of datedness to be found here. An absolute classic. (*****)

Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships:
Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz
SummerSlam, August 27, 2000

-Unfortunately, this DVD set does not include groundbreaking triangle ladder match from WrestleMania 2000 here. Instead, we skip to the TLC match from SS2000, which may not be as influential, but is the overall better match. This match is just crazy as all the three teams destroyed themselves with vicious ladder/chair shots and sickening spots. Amongst the memorable spots include Jeff Hardy missing the swanton bomb off the 20-foot ladder and Bubba Ray going through a stack of four tables outside. The ending where Jeff and D'Von were hanging on the belts is just unforgettable. But alas, it was E&C that walked away with the belts. I remember watching this as a kid and being incensed that the Hardyz didn't win the titles in their home state, but viewed today, this remains one of the pinnacles of the illustrious tag team division in the Attitude Era and it deservedly won numerous Match of the Year awards. Unquestionably, one of the best matches of all time. (*****).

Ladder Match for a Contract for the Cruiserweight Championship:
3 Count vs. Jung Dragons vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias
Starrcade, December 17, 2000.

-This is from the dying days of WCW as the company was going down in flames before being bought in 2001. This was when the cruiserweights were taking stage after the departure of the Radicalz, mesmerizing fans with spectacular high-flying action. It's nice that they included a WCW match here and the match certainly delivers as a enthralling train wreck. The only downside is that the match is not as refined as the other WWE ladder matches, mostly due to the lack of booking at the time, as each spot seems more blatantly planned than tightly choreographed. But for anyone else who just doesn't care about in-ring storytelling and want to see human bodies fly in beautiful form, this match will whet your appetite. (***)

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:
Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho.
Royal Rumble, January 21, 2001

-Boy, do I feel depressed now. This is the first Chris Benoit match I've seen in 7 years, so you can already guess where my sentiments lie. This was the culmination of the Benoit/Jericho feud of 2000 as they were engaged in a series of great wrestling matches before they settled it in this brutal classic. There was no ""car crash"" spot or meticulous choreography; just an intense brawl between two guys beating the hell out of each other with ladders. These guys literally destroyed themselves as Benoit got a chair after an attempted tope and even missed a diving head butt off the top of the ladder. The match also marks the debut of the ""Walls of Jericho"" on the ladder and it looks very impressive even to this day. While this match may be hard to watch today given Benoit's actions, there's no denying that it remains as exciting today as it was back in 2001. (****)

Tables, Ladders and Chairs II Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships:
Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz
WrestleMania X-Seven, April 1, 2001

-Amazingly, this match was even better than the one from SummerSlam 2000. And get this? It wasn't even the best match of 2001. That shows you how good WWE was back in the day. There was so much craziness, so many sickening bumps throughout the match, as even the accomplices (Lita, Spike Dudley, Rhyno) got involved and were pulverized. The highlight of the match, without question, is Edge spearing Jeff Hardy from a 20-foot ladder. I remember watching it as a youngster and even I stood up and cheered when it happened. This match basically took all the positive aspects from the Tag Team, triangle and first TLC match and merge it together to become a grand spectacle of human carnage and destruction. Like you don't know what this gets. (*****).

Tables, Ladders and Chairs III Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship
Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho
SmackDown, May 24, 2001

-Often overlooked for a variety of reasons (including, of course, Mr. Benoit himself), this match happened during a period when Benoit and Jericho were being pushed as main eventers against Steve Austin and Triple H. Unfortunately, that push was squandered due to HHH and Benoit's injuries, the latter caused by this match. While it may not be as frantic as the previous TLC matches, the match was more dramatically satisfying as Benoit was injured after going through a table and he and Jericho struggled to overcome many odds to keep the belt. Of course, there wouldn't be a TLC match without spots and there were an abundant, including Christian 3D off the ladder through a table and Jeff Hardy leapfrogging over a 20-foot ladder on Bubba Ray Dudley through an announcement table. This was, unfortunately, the last great ladder match from all three teams involved, as most of their subsequent matches as both singles and tag team competitors never came close to the magic they delivered in matches like this. (****).

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:
Christian vs. Edge
No Mercy, October 21, 2001

-Case in point, this match. That is not to say that this match was bad; in fact, it's very good. But there was no sense of astonishment that made the earlier ladder matches so special. Of course, this match is best known for two former partners going at it in a match that they helped define together as a team. It was a skillfully choreographed match, with both men make effective use of the ladder, but it needed a couple of epic spots to make it memorable. On the bright side, seeing Edge use the conchairto on his brother on the ladder made for a very satisfying end. (***).

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:
Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam
Raw, May 27, 2002

-Eddie Guerrero's triumphant return and battles with RVD were few highlights of an otherwise dismal year for WWE, particularly RAW. They had two previous encounters for the IC title before settling the score with this match on RAW. This match was a fast-paced, high-spot dazzler that showed that Eddie was back on top form after a year-long absence. Eddie and RVD literally beat the tar out of each other with the ladder, with Eddie performing a hilo, a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker and a sunset-flip power bomb and RVD performing his signature moves with it. The only flaw, like the HBK/Ramon match, was the ending, where it looked like RVD was going for a five-star off the ladder, but wound up falling. Otherwise, this was one of the best matches on WWE TV for the year. (****).

Ladder Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship:
Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy
Raw, July 1, 2002

-THIS, however, was NOT one of the best matches on WWE TV that year. I don't mean to sound like a contrarian, but I cannot understand the love that this match gets from fans. Jeff Hardy was a shell of his former self at the time and, as much as I love Undertaker, heel or face, I hated the American Bad A-- gimmick. This match was hyped as Jeff Hardy's once-in-a-lifetime shot at the Undertaker's WWE Championship and it sure looked like it. Even though the story was Jeff being the underdog, Taker treated him like a joke, where he had the match won a couple of times and chose to inflict more punishment and Jeff only performed one spot that was memorable, that being the somersault tope off the ladder on Taker. Of course, Taker wins and Jeff Hardy earns his respect. Unfortunately, this did nothing for Jeff Hardy's career at the time as he relinquished in midcard hell before being released in 2003. Sluggish and dull, with a couple of good spots (**)

Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships:
Kane & the Hurricane vs. Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray Dudley & Spike Dudley vs. Chris Jericho & Christian.
Raw, May 27, 2002

-Just to show you how badly the WWE was doing in 2002: they promote Hurricane as a participant in the match and he doesn't even show up. So Kane has to go at it alone, taking on all the three teams without his partner. With the exception of that subplot, this match is basically a rehash of all the TLC matches, compressed in TV form. It's a fun match to watch, but there was little drama throughout the battle (only Kane's struggle to win on his own felt gripping) and the winner could be seen coming from a mile away. Thankfully, they ended showing the match just before HHH came out and accuse Kane of being a murderer, jumpstarting the reviled ""Katie Vick"" angle. Another interesting note: this was the match where Bubba Ray Dudley sustained such a nasty concussion that he completely forgot everything that happened in the match. (***)

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:
Christian vs. Chris Jericho
Unforgiven, September 12, 2004.

-When Edge suffered a groin injury in late 2004, he was forced to forfeit the Intercontinental belt. The contenders for the belt were Jericho and the returning Christian. Their shot at the IC title would be decided in a ladder match. This was by-the-books ladder match: good, but nothing special. Clearly, they were off their game that night as the pacing was all over the place and they rehashed most of the spots they've done in the past. But it was still a solid match and Jericho winning the Intercontinental title was a pleasant surprise. (***).

Money in the Bank Ladder Match:
Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Kane
WrestleMania 21, April 3, 2005

-The first Money in the Bank ladder match and undoubtedly the best. Chaos abounded everywhere as all six men used the ladder to destroy one another. This was inspired chaos, the likes not seen since the TLC matches in 2001. I especially loved the way Kane was used here, as an indestructible force that could undermine everything. But the star of the match was Shelton Benjamin, who delivered two of the most memorable spots: the T-bone suplex off the ladder and the jaw-dropping running clothesline off the ladder on Jericho. Watching that for the first time left me in utter awe. Even to this day, I'm still amazed. Benoit's head butt off the ladder on Kane is also another highlight. But in the end, the victory went to Edge, getting the win of his career and starting his run as a bona fide main eventer. Absolutely fantastic. I'm glad they put this match on the set. (****).

Ladder Match for Dominick's Custody
Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio
SummerSlam, August 21, 2005

-How do you screw up a solid feud between two great athletes? By inserting a stupid storyline in it. That's exactly what happened to Eddie and Rey in the summer of 2005, as they no longer feuded over who the better wrestler was, but who would get custody of Rey's son Dominick. To be fair, a phenomenal ladder match between these two would make up for a laughable storyline, right? Unfortunately, the match was merely good. Rey and Eddie are incapable of having a lousy match and this wasn't one of them. But the storyline overtook the match, with Dominick and Vicki Guerrero interfering in the match. Nor did it help that it featured a botched sunset-flip bomb and a sloppy backdrop, which both stood out like sore thumbs. When Rey grabs the briefcase and dangles on the hook, one doesn't get the sense that they saw a great match, but that they're glad that the feud is over. (***).

""Loser Leaves Raw"" Ladder Match:
Edge vs. Matt Hardy
Raw, October 3, 2005

Speaking of feuds ending, we have this. Edge and Matt Hardy had an intensely personal feud throughout the summer, due to Lita having an affair with Edge, and this match would settle it The loser, of course, leaves RAW. This ladder match, as one reviewer pointed out, was more of a fight than a ladder match. But the ladder was used inventively by its participants, including one by Matt where he sandwiches the ladder on Edge (it could be seen on the DVD set when opened). Kendo sticks, chairs and a table were also involved, but Lita proved to be the ultimate factor as she prevented Matt from winning by tying him up around the ropes with her legs. Edge wins to become one of the WWE's biggest stars while Matt Hardy will be stuck in SmackDown midcard until his release in 2009. Very good TV match. (***).

Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Championship:
Edge vs. Ric Flair
Raw, January 16, 2006

-This was after Edge cashed in the Money in the Bank to become WWE Champion. This match was a change of pace from previous ladder matches as it was not an epic spotfest or a brutal brawl, but a classic story of a washed-up underdog going for one last shot against a younger, healthier champion. Despite reservations of Flair being in this environment, this was a fantastic match that told a great story and got the fans involved. There were moments when Flair really looked like he was going to win. There was even a moment when Flair took a suplex off the ladder and we felt that he was done for. Even though Edge won the match, Flair proved to the world that he was still the man. THIS was how the Jeff Hardy/Undertaker match should have been like. (****).

Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Championship:
John Cena vs. Edge
Unforgiven, September 17, 2006

-Man, Edge is everywhere on this set. He and John Cena had a fantastic feud in 2006, which all came to a head at Unforgiven in Edge's hometown of Toronto, Ontario. The stipulation was that if Cena loses, he goes to SmackDown. Wow, is SmackDown really that bad of a show that going there is considered a form of punishment? Anyway, the TLC match rocked my socks off. Edge shows why he is the master of this environment, and no matter how you feel about John Cena, you cannot deny that he delivers the goods on PPV, which this match shows. Seeing Cena FU Edge off the ladder through two tables was truly a sight to see. It's not perfect; there are a few minor botches, such as failed sunset-flip bomb through a table and a weak chair shot by Cena, but overall, a tremendous effort by both men. (****)

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:
Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro
Raw, November 20, 2006

-After a three-year long absence, Jeff Hardy made his return to the WWE, this time, in better form. As soon as he returned, he feuded with Johnny Nitro over the Intercontinental Championship. One of their best matches was the ladder match on Raw, the week before Survivor Series 2006. Even though Nitro has never been in a ladder match, watching this match, you would think he was in many beforehand. There was an onslaught of terrifically sick ladder spots, including a dropkick by Nitro off the ladder and Jeff missing the swanton bomb on Nitro and hitting the ladder instead. One of the most personal favorites is Nitro throwing a ladder at Jeff and his head being wrapped around the ladder. This match proved that Jeff Hardy was back with a vengeance and that Johnny Nitro was the future of the company. An underrated classic. (****)

Fatal Four-Way Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships
Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. the Hardyz vs. MNM vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor

-The last match on the set and a pure delight for ladder match fans of all ages. The match was originally scheduled to be London/Hendrick vs. Regal/Taylor in a normal tag team match, but to make a good match even better, Teddy Long makes it a fatal-four way ladder match which will also involve MNM and the Hardyz. And thank God cause this match is terrific. It's sloppy, messy and a complete utter trainwreck, but in a good way. There was non-stop action everywhere as bodies were literally thrown off the ladder onto the hard canvas. This match is, of course, notorious for the infamous sea-saw spot that destroyed Joey Mercury's nose and it's pretty sickening to watch. There's even a good dose of comedy in Regal/Taylor's fear of climbing ladders. Kendrick/London barely retain the belts in a hard-fought battle. What a great way to end this DVD set. (****)

With multiple ****+ matches and not a single DUD in sight, this has to be one of the greatest wrestling DVD sets of all time. This set is so good that you won't notice there's anything else missing. Okay, there's the obligatory WMX classic and the triangle ladder match at WrestleMania 2000, but then there's also Christian vs. RVD on RAW September 2003, Edge & Christian vs. Hardyz on RAW September 2000, Rock vs. Mankind on RAW February 1999, RVD vs. Jeff Hardy in SummerSlam 2001, Syxx vs. Eddie Guerrero in Souled Out 1997 and the Money in the Bank matches in WrestleMania 22 and 23. But overall, that's very nit-picky.

I cannot recommend this DVD set enough to all wrestling fans, particularly those that love ladder matches. As an introduction to the ladder match, it is sublime. As a collection of high-quality matches, it is absolutely superb.

Strongest recommendation to buy immediately.",1371513600,2,21846,4.708038753600419

2701720,5,B000LC3IJ2,"The ladder match and the Hardys made me fall in love with wrestling in my preteen years, so its great to see a DVD that is basically dedicated to both (after all, Matt and Jeff are partly responsible for putting the match on the map). I like that the WWE went way back with the history of ladder matches and the selection here is great overall. I'm also very glad that only one or two of these matches overlap to the ""Edge: A Decade of Decadence"" DVD. Since he's been an integral part of the evolution of the ladder match, it would have been easy for duplicate matches to appear on both DVDs. Its good to see that WWE took the time to make sure this wasn't the case.

One thing struck me as odd, however: In the RAW match between RVD and Eddie, there is a shot where Eddie is climbing the ladder and the camera cuts to Benoit in the crowd. While the shot is on Benoit you hear the ladder crash, and the camera cuts back to the ring with Eddie and the ladder on the ground. Now, I watched this episode live on TV with a friend and in that moment a fan in a D-X shirt ran out and knocked the ladder over. Needless to say, this made us FREAK OUT, and explains why Eddie looks so pissed all of a sudden! I just find it silly that the WWE felt the need to edit this ""one in a million"" moment out. Come on guys, learn to laugh at yourselves a little!

But anyway, great and extensive DVD set! My only complaint is that the ""formula"" of the ladder match can get a bit repetitive if you watch the whole set in one sitting, but that's just minor nitpicking on an otherwise stellar collection.",1272326400,,1583,4.119741100323624
2701721,5,B000LC3IJ2,"3 Disc Widescreen Edition (2007)

This DVD set is unfortunately hosted by Todd Grisham playing in character. Some of the superstars drop the act and try to play it straight when they drop in to talk - Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, Ric Flair...but others ham it up and stay true to their characters - Edge, Gregory Helms, Jeff Hardy, Kane, and the duo Joey Mercury & Johnny Nitro (You might know him now as John Morrison).

The set starts off with one of the earliest known ladder matches - Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter in 1979. It's for a bag of cash and is oddly anticlimactic but you have to give them credit since they were doing something new and didn't have a lot of ideas to go with yet. Then it moves on to Shawn Michaels who really paved the way for young superstars with this type of match and you get to see him vs. Bret Hart and then Razor Ramon.

I enjoy listening to the old-school commentary with that old British guy, Jesse Ventura, and also Mr. McMahon in the days before taking off his mask and revealing himself to be Chairman of the Board. He's such a stiff and Ventura just blatantly criticizes him every chance he gets which makes him a fun color commentator. When Ventura hosted Raw, he went back on the mike and I really enjoyed that segment. You'll also get to hear the good ol' days of Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and good ol' J.R. teaming up on commentary. They really were the best team ever with information, attitude, and timing. Ever since J.R. left, it just hasn't been the same at the WWE, especially with that idiot Matt Striker at PPV events. He doesn't even get their names right some of the time. Also JBL will be on the mike towards the end of the set too which I always felt was his forte, he was a better color commentator than wrestler.

There are several matches featuring Edge, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy, Christian, Chris Jericho, the Dudley Boyz, and Chris Benoit. Most of them are two on two and many of them feature two or four two-man teams all facing off at the same time. You can revisit the tag teams of New Brood, Dudley Boyz, Hardy Boyz, 3 Count, Jung Dragons, and Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias. Not all are strictly ladder matches either, there are SIX TLC (Tables, Ladders, Chairs) matches including the first ever TLC match for the World Tag Team Championship at Summerslam 2000 with Dudley Boyz, Hardy Boyz, and Edge and Christian.

I'm still waiting for when Edge and Christian reunite as a team or in a feud at present since ECW has been dissolved and Christian can now rumble with the peeps on Raw or Smackdown if he wants. I bet they're waiting till after Wrestlemania before going there and a lot will depend on who has a belt and if Christian gets to be Mr. Money-in-the-Bank.

Edge has probably had more ladder matches than any other competitor in the WWE and has probably suffered more injuries and is prone to more injury than any other because of it. He goes on a tear about how these matches are career-shortening and that is easy to believe since they put so much pressure on the body. I saw Edge do a ladder match with Jeff Hardy at the Royal Rumble in Detroit in 2009 and they were jumping from the highest ladders onto the announce tables and breaking things. It is scary stuff!

The more participants in the ring, the more dangerous and hard to keep track of it becomes. Chris Benoit could testify to that based on his match in a fatal four-way where one leap ended up shattering two discs in his neck, a very scary moment. Another even scarier moment in appearance is when a ladder hits Joey Mercury in the face shattering his nose and he ended up getting 25 stitches and losing 35% of the vision in his left eye. This is by far the most gruesome stunt in the collection.

Other superstars featured in the collection are Triple H vs The Rock, The Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy, Kane and the Hurricane on a team against three others, and Ric Flair against Edge. Triple H is super young and still getting called ""Hunter Hearst Helmsley."" He is accompanied by Chyna and has a live DX band playing his entrance music which makes The Rock have to take even longer getting to the ring. I hear that The Rock will be hosting Raw sometime this summer so THAT should be something to look forward to since most of the time he seems to spend denying he was ever involved and becoming Disney's tool.

The most disturbing storyline culminating in a match would be Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio over the custody of a child named Dominick. Of course it's a fake story, but it's just kind of weird and creepy to get the kid involved like that and have him at ringside looking like a little lost Oliver Twist.

The most exciting match in the collection would be the ""Money In the Bank"" match at WrestleMania 21 in 2005 with Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Edge, Shelton Benjamin, Christian, and Kane. Shelton Benjamin really made a name for himself by showing off some major stunts and high-flying action, but Edge was the one to win!

This three disc set is hosted by Todd Grisham and throughout the presentation you will hear from susperstars commenting on their experiences and thoughts about competing in the Ladder Match that includes Shawn Michaels, Edge, Chris Benoit, Jeff Hardy, Kane, John Cena, Shelton Benjamin, Gregory Helms, Johnny Nitro & Joey Mercury, & the ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair.

Canadian Stampede Wrestling
North American Heavyweight Champion Jake Roberts Vs. Big Daddy Ritter(Junk Yard Dog) - This match was very unique. It isn't like the usual Ladder Matches we see today. Roberts and Ritter was using a one sided ladder and with help from the referee would climb the ladder for the championship belt. Nothing really special but basically here only for history value only. 3/5

Shawn Michaels Vs. Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart - This was during Bret Hart's second I.C. Title run and it during the early stages of Shawn Michaels becoming the ""Heartbreak Kid."" Michaels and Hart mostly kept this match on the ground and used the ladder to infelct pain on one another. Not a bad match but doesn't top their future bouts for the WWE Championship. Mostly here to display how WWE took the Ladder Match concept and re-invented it. 4/5

SummerSlam (August 27, 1995)
Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels Vs. Razor Ramon - Really glad WWE chose this match to put on here and not Michaels' and Razor's Wrestlemania X Ladder Match because most people forget that this match took place. Razor and Michaels put on a complete different match then from what they put on at Wrestlemania X. This match doesn't disappoint and it delivers. 4.5/5

SummerSlam (August 30, 1998)
Triple H Vs. Intercontinental Champion The Rock - The Rock and HHH topped their match from Fully Loaded a month earlier here. Even though Austin/Undertaker was the main event for this SummerSlam, HHH and The Rock stole the show. The Rock and HHH told a good story with HHH competing with an injured knee and over coming the punishment inflected on him and The Rock being the most ruthless he has ever been up to this point in his career. Mark Henry and Chyna playing significant roles in the match as well. This match would be the rocket ship for both The Rock's and HHH's careers that led to both men becoming big stars and World Champions in the future. 5/5

No Mercy (October 17, 1999)
Edge & Christian Vs. New Brood (Hardy Boyz) - This is the match that eventually put both teams on the map. This being the first tag team Ladder Match, all four men put on a great performance while putting on great and nonstop action all the way through. Never a slow moment in this match and this match delivered and then some. 5/5 [Also Available on ""Edge: Decade Of Decadence""]

SummerSlam (August 27, 2000)
World Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian Vs. Hardy Boyz Vs. Dudley Boyz - This was the first TLC Match and it provided new and more unpredictable spots then from their Ladder Match earlier in the year at Wrestlemania. So many breath taking and exciting spots in this one that are too many to call. Awesome match and just one of those firsts that can never be over done again. 5/5

Starrcade (December 17, 2000)
Shane Helms & Shannon Moore Vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagias Vs. Jung Dragons - This match was for a shot at the WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chavo Guerrero Jr. All six men were at their prime here and they put on nonstop action all the way that was really the match of the night for Starrcade this year. Not really spotfesty like the TLC Matches in the WWE but these six men put on one heck of a perfromance that produced a great and exciting match. 5/5 [Also available on ""Starrcade: The Essential Collection""]

Royal Rumble (January 21, 2001)
Intercontinetal Champion Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho - Honestly, this match is one of the most brutal and violent one-on-one Ladder Matches of all-time. Benoit and Jericho just went out there and beat the holy hell out of each other. Both Jericho and Benoit takes soem hard bumps and Jericho's chairshot to Benoit when he dives through the ropes is very hardcore. This is one of those matches that when you look back on the PPV, this match was the match of the night. Just a show stealing match and a classic at that. 5/5

WrestleMania X-Seven (April 1, 2001)
Edge & Christian Vs. World Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz Vs. Hardy Boyz - TLC II followed the exact same procedure as from TLC I only with the exception of Rhyno, Spike Dudley, & Lita all coming out and getting involved to a degree. The match was highlighted by Edge leaping off a 20 foot ladder and spearing Jeff Hardy (who was hanging off the hooks holding the belts) out of mid air to the floor. Another great TLC Match and one that will never be forgotten. 5/5

Smackdown (May 24, 2001)
World Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit Vs. Edge & Christian Vs. Dudley Boyz Vs. Hardy Boyz - Definitely the most forgotten and rare TLC Match in history. Mainly because of Edge not including this match when he says ""I have never lost a TLC Match"" and Benoit & Jericho just winning the Tag Team Titles on the previous Raw in the match where Triple H suffered his first quadricept injury. Benoit & Jericho bringing out new and unpredictable things to this TLC Match that we haven't seen before including Chris Benoit going through a table after trying to hit his diving headbutt off the top rope and suffering a con-chair-to to his already injured ribs from E&C that led to having neck surgery a month later. A ""lost forgotten classic"" here. 5/5

No Mercy (October 21, 2001)
Edge Vs. Intercontinental Champion Christian - Its interesting to see Edge and Christian going head to head with each other in a Ladder Match but this one doesn't top Edge's and Christian's later Ladder Matches and also doesn't come close to their prevoius ones. But still a good match to check out. 4.5/5

Raw (May 27, 2002)
Intercontinental Champion Eddie Guerrero Vs. RVD - Eddie and RVD surpassed their match from Backlash. The ladder really meshed well the styles of both men which allowed RVD and Eddie to take their regular moves and make them more devastating by using the ladder. RVD and Eddie put on a wrestling clinic while producing a tremendous Ladder Match in the process. Classic match and without of a doubt one of the best Ladder Matches in history in my book. 5/5 [Also Available on ""Cheating Death: The Eddie Guerrero Story""]

Raw (July 1, 2002)
WWE Undisputed Champion The Undertaker Vs. Jeff Hardy - The back story to this match was to display the beating the Undertaker gave Hardy and Hardy refusing to give up and actually having the chance winning the Undisputed Championship. A good match but Jim Ross' commentating really made it more then what it was. 4.5/5

Raw (October 7, 2002)
World Tag Team Champion Kane Vs. Chris Jericho & Christian Vs. Bubba & Spike Dudley Vs. RVD & Jeff Hardy - Kane was going it alone in this TLC Match and he did a fantastic job holding his own against the other three teams. Lots of exciting and breath taking spots in this match that includes Hardy dropping a leg drop to Kane through a table from the top of the ladder, RVD hitting the ""Van-Terminator"" to Kane, and Kane chokeslamming Jericho from the top of the ladder. Lots of hard and impactive shots in this match where one includes Bubba Dudley suffering a concussion where he doesn't remember the match to this day. 5/5 [Also Available on ""RAW: 10th Anniversary""]

Unforgiven (September 12, 2004)
Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - This Ladder Match was for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. Christian topped his previous match with Edge here as Christian and Jericho told a good story just like what HHH/Rock and Jericho/Benoit did. Brutal match where both Jericho and Christian takes a lot of hard bumps. 5/5

WrestleMania 21 (April 3, 2005)
Kane Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Christian Vs. Edge - This was the first Money In The Bank Ladder Match and to me it still holds the title as being the greatest MITB Ladder Match to date. Shelton Benjamin created his own highlight reel as he stole the show here. Benoit told a great story with his arm being injured and nearly winning the match with Edge becoming the ""Ultimate Opportunist"" character that we see from him today. Terrific match. 5/5

SummerSlam (August 21, 2005)
Eddie Guerrero Vs. Rey Mysterio - This was a great Ladder Match but the whole ""Dominic Is My Son"" storyline was just so stupid. A good Ladder Match where Eddie & Mysterio brought out some new innovative moves tot he match. Interferences from Vickie Guerrero & Dominic himself. Still a good match with the idiotic storyline. 4.5/5

Raw (October 3, 2005)
Matt Hardy Vs. Edge - This was a ""Loser Leaves Town"" Match as hardy and Edge ended their rivalry here. This was another great Ladder Match but just doesn't come up to par with their previous Ladder Matches with each other. But still another great match among the two Ladder Match veterans. 4.75/5

Raw (January 15, 2006)
WWE Champion Edge Vs. Ric Flair - The back story to this match was to display Flair can still take a beating along with Flair possibably winning the WWE Title in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. Flair gets very bloody here but he held his own against the ladder match veteran Edge. Another good TLC Match thats worth a view. 4.5/5

Unforgiven (September 17, 2006)
WWE Champion Edge Vs. John Cena - I give props to Cena here. Being booed like crazy in Edge's hometown of Toronto and competing in Edge's match, Cena did an outstanding job. Both brought their best stuff and they deliver a fantastic TLC Match. 5/5

Raw (November 20, 2006)
Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy Vs. Johnny Nitro - This match gave Nitro the title ""The Superstar On The Rise."" This was Nitro's first Ladder Match and he did a wonderful job hanging in there toe to toe with Hardy. Another great match in their series. 4.5/5

Armageddon (December 17, 2006)
WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick Vs. The Hardys Vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor Vs. MNM - We all know what the Hardys and MNM can bring to this type of match but they produced a great Ladder Match with the daredevils London and Kendrick with Regal and Taylor not quite being ""a fish out of water"" with their mat based style of wrestling. Joey Mercury takes one of the most violent & sick shots from the ladder which crushes the face of Joey Mercury just in seconds from being hit with it. Another fantastic and off the wall Ladder Match. 5/5

WWE- The Ladder Match
The Ladder Match. It is one of the most violent, most entertaining, and most high-risk matches in WWE history. WWE has given us this gift of 22 amazing Ladder Matches in this 3-Disk set. Todd Grisham hosts this set, and he does a great job of being a geek that is entertaining. Some people complain because this set lacks the Triangle Ladder Match from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-April-2-2000/dp/6305994781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania April 2, 2000</a>&nbsp;and Shawn/Razor from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-X-10-Years-In-The-Making/dp/6305276994/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania X - 10 Years In The Making</a>, but I like the fact that they gave us some of the lesser know Ladder Match instead of those two. If you are a wrestling fan this needs to be in your collection. This not only shows the evolution of the Ladder Match, but the evolution of WWE as a whole.

-Disc 1-

Ladder Match (Stampede Wrestling- July 1979)
North American Heavyweight Championship & Cash
Jake Roberts VS Big Daddy Ritter
This is one of the very early Ladder Matches from Stampede Wrestling. The match is joined in progress. It's worth a watch once, but after that you won't watch it again.
RATING- 4/10

Ladder Match (July 21, 1992)
Intercontinental Championship
Bret Hart(c) VS Shawn Michaels
This match was another early Ladder Match; this time the match was a WWF match. The match isn't horrible, but it's another match you'll only watch once.
RATING- 6/10

Ladder Match (Summerslam 1995)
Intercontinental Championship
Shawn Michaels(c) VS Razor Ramon
This was the rematch from their classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-X-10-Years-In-The-Making/dp/6305276994/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania X - 10 Years In The Making</a>&nbsp;Ladder match. Both men work really hard to pull off a great match. Shawn Michaels takes a terrible bump when he is suplexed off the ring and his ankle hits the guardrail. The reason why the score is only 8.5 is because the ending is severely screwed up. Michaels attempts to grab the belt 3 in a row before being successful.
RATING- 8.5/10

Ladder Match (Summerslam 1998)
Intercontinental Championship
Triple H VS The Rock(c)
This is one of my favorite Ladder Matches. It's funny to think that a few short months later The Rock would be WWF Champion and about a year later Triple H would be WWF Champion. Both men put on a show filled with great, new spots. The Rock even delivers a People's Elbow to Triple H while he's on the Ladder. This match can't get a perfect score due to the ending.
RATING- 9.5/10

Terri Invitational Tournament- Ladder Match (No Mercy 1999)
Edge & Christian VS New Brood (Jeff and Matt Hardy)
If you've ever seen any of their other Ladder matches, this will disappoint you. This was more like a sample of what you would get later on. You see all your regular Hardy moves and that's about it. Also, for most of the match, they don't even seem to care about getting the money hanging above the ring, but instead just want to do crazy moves. Still, it's cool to see the Hardys pulling off some of their early moves in this match.
RATING- 7.5/10

Tables, Ladders, and Chairs Match (Summerslam 2000)
World Tag Team Championships
Dudley Boyz VS Edge & Christian(c) VS Hardy Boyz
Now, this was a big step up from the last match. The Dudleys are what really bring this match together. I'm not saying they are the best, but if they weren't in it, it would be exactly like the No Mercy match. Lots of awesome spots and tons of broken tables, that's what you can expect. Bubba, Matt, and Jeff all take huge Ladder to Table spots near the end. Edge and Christian sneak in the back door to pick up the victory.
RATING- 9/10

Triple Ladder Match (WCW Starrcade 2000) (Match of the DVD)
Contract for WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match
3 Count VS Jung Dragons VS Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias
What the ****? That's right WCW is in the house. Now, this is from the end of 2000, just a few short months before WCW died. So, you expect crap right? No. This match is one of the greatest Ladder Matches of all time. You see many innovative spots that you'll never see in WWE. They even stack the ladders like a scaffold and do moves off of it. Also, even though this is a tag team match, there can be only one winner. Which adds to the interesting nature of things.
RATING- 10/10

Ladder Match (Royal Rumble 2001)
Intercontinental Championship
Chris Benoit(c) VS Chris Jericho
The Benoit/Jericho rivalry erupts into a Ladder Match. This was a well-paced match; I just felt it lacked something great. Benoit gets smashed in the face by a steel chair while try to dive onto Jericho. There are just too many ""I push you off the ladder and you fall out the ring"" spots.
RATING- 8/10

-Disc 2-

TLC 2 (Wrestlemania X7)
Edge & Christian VS Dudley Boyz(c) VS Hardy Boyz
These 3 teams put on the perfect match. They have really worked out the kinks from the original TLC match and fixed it here. Edge does the insane spear on Hardy while he is hanging from the belts spot that you see in millions of highlight videos. Rhyno, Spike Dudley, and Lita all make appearances and have their own spots.
RATING- 10/10

Fatal Four-Way TLC 3 (Smackdown, May 24, 2001)
World Tag Team Championships
Edge & Christian VS Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit(c) VS Hardy Boyz VS Dudley Boyz
This is often called the forgotten TLC match due to the fact that Edge lost this TLC match, despite Edge claiming he's never lost a TLC Match. Benoit and Jericho make this TLC different than the previous two by bringing their styles to this match. There are a lot of different spots then the other TLC matches, which means you won't feel like this is the same match you've already seen. Benoit gets injured pretty badly.
RATING- 9/10

Ladder Match (No Mercy 2001)
Intercontinental Championship
Christian(c) VS Edge
Well, the amazing team couldn't last forever. Both Edge and Christian pursue singles careers instead of staying a tag team. The match is significantly slower than all of the other matches so far, but it's still got its strong points. The ending is really well done.
RATING- 8/10

Ladder Match (Raw, May 27, 2002)
Intercontinental Championship
Eddie Guerrero(c) VS Rob Van Dam
I really enjoyed this match. A good portion of the match is not focused on the later, but they build up the match before bringing it into the ring. RVD plummets from the ladder when he stumbles trying to do a frog splash. Great match, especially for Raw. Chris Benoit makes an appearance.
RATING- 8.5/10

Ladder Match (Raw, July 1, 2002)
Undisputed WWE Championship
Undertaker(c) VS Jeff Hardy
I don't understand why some people consider this an amazing match. This was a good, solid match, but it lacked a lot of action. I will admit that it had a lot of emotion wrapped into it. I was just expecting more spots and Hardy to not be beat down most of HIS match.
RATING- 7.5/10

TLC 4 (Raw, October 7, 2002)
World Tag Team Championships
Kane(c) VS Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy VS Bubba Ray & Spike Dudley VS Jericho & Christian
Kane is Tag Team Champions with Hurricane Helms, but Triple H attacked Hurricane earlier in the night so Kane is on his own. The match didn't live up to the other great TLC matches, but it was still fun to watch. The action seemed random and didn't draw enough emotion.
RATING- 8/10

Ladder Match (Unforgiven 2004)
Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho VS Christian
After Edge was forced to vacate the title due to injury, a new champion must be decided. The match itself wasn't all that great. The pacing seemed very off and there weren't any really good spots to cover that up.
RATING- 7/10

-Disc 3-

Money in the Bank Ladder Match (Wrestlemania 21)
Chris Benoit VS Chris Jericho VS Edge VS Shelton Benjamin VS Christian VS Kane
Now this was an awesome way to start out the final disk. The winner would receive a title shot at anytime of his choosing anytime over the next year. All men put on a great effort in this spot filled match. Shelton Benjamin really puts on a show you have to see to believe.
RATING- 9/10

Ladder Match (Summerslam 2005)
Custody of Dominick
Eddie Guerrero VS Rey Mysterio
Seeing as you won't have to actually watch the long, drawn out, ridiculous story line on TV, you will not hate this match as much as everyone else. This ladder match was different and contained spots that you've never seen before, including a sick backdrop from the ladder onto another ladder that was propped up on it.
RATING- 9/10

Ladder Match (Raw, October 3, 2005)
Loser Leaves Raw/Money in the Bank
Edge VS Matt Hardy
This was a strong match from Raw with a very real storyline behind it. The loser had to leave Raw, but the winner would get the MITB. Some good spots but this can't top the two previous matches.
RATING- 8/10

TLC 5 (Raw, January 16, 2006)
WWE Championship
Edge(c) VS Ric Flair
Four years after the last TLC takes place we get our first singles TLC match. No one expected Ric Flair to win this match considering Edge had just won the title, but Flair made us believe through the course of this match. Flair takes a ton of punishment and almost pulls it off.
RATING- 8/10

TLC 6 (Unforgiven 2006)
WWE Championship
John Cena VS Edge(c)
Cena is in yet another hostile environment, much like he was at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ECW-One-Night-Stand/dp/B000EXZKSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ECW: One Night Stand</a>. They are in Edge's hometown and in Edge's match. Good pacing and a strong amount of spots. Cena screws up a sunset flip, but we can't be too hard on him.
RATING- 8.5/10

Ladder Match (Raw, November 20, 2006)
Intercontinental Championship
Jeff Hardy(c) VS Johnny Nitro
A very good Raw match that put Johnny Nitro on the map for many people. Nitro hits an amazing dropkick to Hardy while both are on the Ladder. Good match, worth a watch.
RATING- 8/10

Fatal Four-Way Ladder Match (Armageddon 2006)
WWE Tag Team Championship
Paul London & Brian Kendrick(c) VS MNM VS Hardys VS William Regal & Dave Taylor
To close the DVD, they give you the brutal Ladder match from Armageddon. The match is really just a cluster until Joey Mercury gets his nose broken and is rushed to the hospital. It is really a brutal shot that you have to see to believe. After that the match picks up and you see some really good spots.

HIGHLIGHTS

HBK vs Bret Hart

HBK vs Razor Ramon(Shawn Michaels gets suplexed out of the ring onto the security railing in this one. Unbelievable that he didn't get hurt)

HHH vs The Rock(One of the better matches on this disc. Ten years old and it still feels fresh. This IS the match that The Rock went over with the fans. MSG crowd cheered both but really gave Rocky his props when he hit the People's Elbow and Rock Bottom.)

Hardy's vs Edge/Christian(This is the match that started the phrase ""pop."" The crowd was really into this one and Jeff Hardy really shined in this one. All four of them must have been sore for a month.)

TLC 1,2(Too many high points in these matches to list. The second one is slightly longer.)

RVD vs Eddie Guererro(I remembered liking this match more when I first saw it on Raw. There are some botched stunts in this one and Eddie had some problems with the ladder at times but for TV it was a real treat.)

John Cena vs Edge(I really wanted to see this one when I bought this disc, didn't watch the PPV. Edge was champion in his hometown and was clearly emotional when he got to the ring. I really don't think his head was clear. Cena is obviously pissed at Edge towards the end of the match.
Cena took a chair shot to the head and when it was Edge's turn to re-pay the favor he really missed it. They were not on the same page in the second-half. Cena would have Edge knocked down outside the ring and would be heading back in the ring and Edge would just be laying there and Cena would have to putter up the ladder. It looked really bad, this happenend a couple times. But, there were some good table spots to save the day.)",1206921600,,1713,4.265432098765432

2701743,5,B000LC3IJ2,"The WWE's compilation DVDs have remained of fantastic quality no matter how much the quality of the modern product has suffered in the last 5 years. This latest set includes some of the most spectacular ladder matches that have ever been seen. Rather than featuring a documentary with bonus matches like some of their DVDs, this set thankfully keeps to the matches themselves, although most matches have some footage of the build-up to them or even a brief interview with one of the participants (eg Edge or HBK) which is quite useful. Unfortunately the matches are introduced by the ever-annoying Todd Grisham.

The matches are listed in another review and there are a number of classics on there. The evolution of the ladder match is clear to see from the comparatively tame (but still great) 1992 match between HBK and Bret Hart into the TLC spotfests which are truly awesome to watch. TLC has now evolved again into Money In The Bank which has become a new Wrestlemania tradition and is something to look forward to each year. This collection covers all of that.

The match selection is almost flawless but there are a few matches which should have been on there. The WM10 match between HBK and Razor Ramon is mentioned on the DVD as the best ladder match ever and then not featured, instead they show their Summerslam rematch. I can sort of understand this, because the WM match is on the HBK collection but some people won't have seen this. I would have also picked the WMXVI triangle ladder match between the Hardyz, Dudleys and E&C over their 2nd TLC match (which was essentially a repeat of the first TLC). It would have been cool to see an ECW ladder match to see how they used to do them, but instead we just get one WCW match.

Overall though I can't see anyone being disappointed by this set and it is essential viewing for any wrestling fan. I would suggest checking the price on [...] rather than [...] because my set cost me less than half what it is going for on here.",1200182400,,1985,4.570224719101123
2701754,5,B000LC3IJ2,"A match that seems simple in concept but has turned into one of the most exciting but brutal bouts that wrestlers can ever participate in. This is a pro-WWE release but it does give a nod to Stampede Wrestling and to World Championship Wrestling. Anyway, here are the matches:

Jake Roberts Vs. Big Daddy Ritter (aka the late great Junkyard Dog) - This was for the Stampede Wrestling North American title. No hard bumps, this was mostly an old school brawl. Worth a look just for the historical factor.

Bret ""Hitman"" Hart Vs. Shawn ""HBK"" Michaels w/Sherri Martel (RIP) - This was for Bret's Intercontinental title. While nothing like the ladder matches Shawn would participate in later, it was a good bout with a few brutal spots.

Shawn Michaels Vs. Razor Ramon - This was the ladder ""rematch"" from WrestleMania X. This time, Shawn was the I-C champion and Razor was the challenger (the roles were reversed in their previous encounter). This one was more fast paced and brutal than their first ladder meeting. A great match.

Triple H Vs. The Rock - On a card that saw ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. The Undertaker as the main event, this match for the I-C title stoled the show at SummerSlam '98. HHH was mainly on the receiving end in this while The Rock was just vicious! While both men would go onto greatness, this match really launched The Rock in my view. Definitely a keeper.

New Brood (The Hardyz) Vs. Edge & Christian - This match was for $50,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. It set the tone for future ladder/TLC matches. I had never seen this bout until this collection and it was every bit as good as the hype I've heard on it.

Edge & Christian Vs. The Hardyz Vs. The Dudleyz - The first TLC match. This is a match I can't begin to describe. You just have to watch.

Shannon Moore & Shane Helms Vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis Vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang - This was during the final days of WCW in late 2000. If all you know of these guys is WWE, then you really need to peep this. One thing that the WCW did better than WWE is the cruiserweight division and this ladder match was proof of that!

Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho - This was at the Royal Rumble 2001. Both men took some vicious bumps. One in particular was when Benoit dived through the ropes and got hit with a chair by Jericho! Not to mention his head bumped the floor as he landed. Not taking up for Benoit because of his recent actions but matches like this can make the case that he had brain damage look valid! OUCH!

Hardyz Vs. Dudleyz Vs. Edge & Christian - This WrestleMania 17 bout was a rematch from SummerSlam 2000 and it was a TLC bout as well. It is still talked about today, particularly the part where Edge speared Jeff Hardy as Jeff was hanging from the hooks that held the WWE Tag Team Titles. I personally prefered the original TLC bout but this one was great as well.

Hardyz Vs. Dudleyz Vs. Edge & Christian Vs. Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho -Proof that Edge HAS lost a TLC match prior to John Cena as Benoit and Jericho (the forgotten Canadian Chris') defended the WWE Tag titles against these three veterans. This bout saw Benoit injure his ribs but more seriously his neck as he did a diving headbutt through a table, missing Matt Hardy! This match is also significant because it took place on Smackdown TV!

Edge Vs. Christian - This was for the I-C title during the infamous 'Invasion' angle. Given the experience of these two, you would've expected an amazing match but it something about it was just ordinary. A good match without question but something about it just wasn't great. Still worth a look.

Rob Van Damn Vs. Eddie Gurrerro - Two words: SEE IT!

Undertaker Vs. Jeff Hardy - Basically its The Undertaker dishing out a beating to Jeff Hardy but Jeff doesn't give up, even earning the respect of The Dead Man at the end. This was for the WWE Title by the way.

Kane Vs. RVD/Jeff Hardy Vs. Buh Buh Ray & Spike Dudley Vs. Jericho & Christian - This was on Monday Night RAW and was for the World Tag Team Titles. Hurricane Helms was supposed to team with Kane but was jumped by HHH and Ric Flair earlier that night so Kane went alone in this match. This was a huge spotfest!

Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - A great climax to their feud which began at WrestleMania 20 earlier that year. It told a very good story and it was for the I-C title.

Chris Jericho Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Edge Vs. Christian Vs. Kane - This was at WrestleMania 21 and was the first Money In The Bank ladder match. Though Edge was the winner of this bout, the show was stoled by Shelton Benjamin! A great bout by all involved.

Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Gurrerro - In one of his last PPV appearances before his untimely passing, Gurrerro took on Rey at SummerSlam 2005. While the angle that led to this match sucked a**, the match itself was amazing! Even the run-ins by Vickie Gurrerro and Dominic (Rey's real life son) didn't take away from this bout.

Matt Hardy Vs. Edge - Another good bout that just fell short somehow. Again, much like Edge Vs. Christian, this was surprising given the experience between these two. This a good contest though but these two have done better (particularly their street fight on RAW and a cage match at Unforgiven 2005).

Ric Flair Vs. Edge - This was amazing just for the fact that at near 60 years old, Flair was willing to take punishment like this! Edge won but this bout proved that Flair can work nearly any type of match!

John Cena Vs. Edge - Amazing bout and one of Cena's better matches! He used his usual move set in very creative ways! You have to see it to believe it.

Jeff Hardy Vs. Johnny Nitro (aka John Morrison) - Nasty Swanton Bomb onto the Ladder as Jeff tried to squash Johnny on it! Even Melina (Johnny's now ex-manager and ex-girlfriend in real life) was stunned on that move! Her reaction says it all. Overall, this was another great win for Jeff but it was also John's breakout performance.

Paul London/Brian Kendrick Vs. William Regal/Dave Taylor Vs. MNM Vs. The Hardyz - What was supposed to be a WWE Tag Title match between the team of London/Kendrick Vs. Regal/Taylor was turned into a Ladder Match at the last minute with MNM and The Hardyz added! While everyone expected the champs, the Hardyz and MNM to do well, Regal and Taylor actually held their own in this match and didn't look out of place as their more traditional style was put to good use! This features Joey Mercury's infamous face crushing as well! For all those that swear that wrestlers don't get hurt! I have one word for you: WHATEVER! Make them watch that scene if nothing else!

Overall, a very good release. When I bought this, I was concerned that they may have pulled the matches with Chris Benoit in them but there was so many other good ones I bought it anyway. Thankfully, they didn't. Not an endorsement of Benoit in any way but I don't like history being altered (especially wrestling history).

The only other bouts I would've liked to have seen was Dusty Rhodes Vs. Tully Blanchard in their barbed wire ladder match from The Great American Bash 1987 and Tommy Dreamer Vs. Justin Credible in their Stairway To Hell ladder match from Guilty As Charged '99.

WHY THE HECK WASN'T IT ON THIS DVD?!?! Anyways, it includes all of the other great ladder match, save for a few here and there. but how can you complain with 21, over 9 hours of the greatest matches in WWE history?

Match listing:

DISC 1:
Jake Roberts Vs. Junkyard Dog
Boring, starts about 5 minutes in. They make no use of the ladder whatsoever. Very old match right here. 2/10

Bret Hart Vs. HBK
The first ever ladder match in WWE history, and what a good one it was. The showstopper Vs. the hitman. They make better use of the ladder in this match, and it's a classic, and is a great example of the best 90's feud of all time. 6.5/10 (age got the best of it)

HBK Vs. Razor Ramon Summerslam 1995
I thought the WMX match was WAY better, but that doesn't mean this one sucks, it's actually really good. You have 2 of the greatest superstars ever in the WWE, and a ladder to determine the outcome. Not as good as their WMX match, but certainly better than others. 8/10

Triple H Vs. The Rock Summerslam 1998
Weird seeing Triple H in tights agin, I totally forgot about the early DX days, and boy was the summer of '98 an amazing one. They make pretty good use of the ladder, no really great spots, but still a good match between 2 guys who later became icons for the WWE. 7.5/10

Edge & Christian Vs. New Brood (Hardy Boyz) No Mercy 1999
First ever tag ladder match, and what an amazing one it was. This match will go down not only as one of the greatest ladder matches ever, but one of the best tag match ever. These 2 teams were just getting started in the WWE, and soon became icons for the greatest tag division ever in WWE history. Great match, great spots. 10/10

First ever TLC match (Dudleyz Vs. Haryz Vs. E&C) Summerslam 2000
This match was evolutionary, and included 3 of the best tag teams ever in WWE histroy. So many amazing table spots, so many amazing ladder spots, so many amazing spots, period. Some of the best entertaininment, and best action ever in WWE history is in this match. Put all three teams to the test, and set the standard for the rest of the ladder matches to come. 10/10

WCW ladder match (3 Count Vs. Jung Dragons Vs. Knoble/Karagias Starrcade 2000
I was never really into WCW that much, but this match was ver ygood because I love cruiser weight type wrestling. I've heard many bash this match, but I enjoyed it. They made good use of the ladders, but you can tell these guys were lost at first. 7.5/10

Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho Royal Rumble 2001
This was one of the better 1on1 ladder matches. A really amazing chair shot with Benoit diving through the ropes and Jericho crashing his skull in. You really get to see what these 2 had to offer, and the walls of Jericho on the top of the ladder. 8.5/10

DISC 2:
TLC 2 WM X-Seven
This match wasn't as god as TLC 1, but was darn near close. Some really amazing spots using tables, and some really nice ladder usage. Highlights incluse a 20 foot spear, and a 20 foot Swanton bomb. Very great match from a very great PPV including once again 3 of the great teams in WWE history. 10/10

TLC 3 (Hardyz Vs. E&C Vs. Dudleyz Vs. Benoit/Jericho)
This will go down as one of the greatest matches ever on Smackdown! and one of the greatest matches period. This is a historic match not only being the first ladder match on WWE TV, but the first ever fatal 4-way. Benoit gets a nasty 13 month injury because of this match, but he still puts on a darn good show. Great action from all 4 teams. blurring was terrible in this match though. 9.5/10

Christian Vs. Edge No Mercy 2001
These 2 were one of the greatest tag teams ever, and this is at the point where they break up, and feud. They made their names known at No mercy '99, and they settle their differences at No Mercy '01. This is a very good match, One of the greatest I've seen from the both of them, only to be outshined by their cage match. 7/10

Eddie Guerrero Vs. RVD
This was the second ever vroadcast ladder match for WWE, and one of my personal favorite 1on1 ladder matches. These 2 were some of the greatest wrestlers WWE ever had. 2 great high flyers, an amazing feud. This match is jst a taste of what they were capable of. A nice botch when RVD tried to 5-star but fell. They edited out where the fan ran in and knocked Eddie off the ladder, which was hilarious. no more blurs. 9/10

Undertaker Vs. Jeff Hardy
MY personal favorite 1on1 ladder match, and will go down as one of Jeff Hardy's greatest matches ever. this match had such a great story, and these 2 really put on an amazing show. Taker was a bit slow however, but it was a very nice match. Taker raised Jeff's hand afterwards, which was a mark out moment. 10/10

TLC 4 (Kane Vs. RVD/Jeff Vs. Bubbah/Spike Vs. Jericho/Christian)
I remember watching this episode of Raw, and can honestly be said to be the greatest Raw of all time. Not only did you get a cage match, a street ight, but then you got this match, another one of the TLC classics including only 3 originals, but that didn't take anything away from it. This was my second favorite TLC, and was full of nonstop action, and had some REALLY nice spots. 10/10.

Chris Jericho Vs. Christian Unforgiven 2004
I didn't really like this match. I love Christian, and I love Y2J, but this match just wasn't the best of them. It was slow, and didn't really have to many highlights. It was awesome when Christian had it won, but because jericho flipped ihm off, he got off the ladder. Not the best match from these 2. 6/10

DISC 3:
First EverMoney in the Bank Ladder Match (Benoit Vs. Jericho Vs. Edge Vs. Kane Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Christian)
This was an amazing match. I love all 6 of these superstars, and you got to see the best from all 6 of them. Shelton shined the brightest in this match, and really showed off what he can do. Why he hasn't had a ladder match for a title is beyond me. Best MitB match to date. 9.5/10

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Rey Mysterio Summerslam 2005
This match was great, but the storyline is what made it terrible. Too many stupid people got involved and ruined it, they did however make the best of this. It's worth watching, but if you remember the story line, you can get easily ticked. 7/10

Edge Vs. Matt Hardy
This was a nice nostalgia moment because of the past these 2 had, but this was nothing short of what the 2 can do. This match had some really nice ladder spots, including osme I've nerver seen before. A little bit too much interference form Lita, and Matt did really good still. a bit on the short side, but still a great match. 8/10

TLC for the WWE title Ric Flair Vs. Edge
This was on live TV? That amazes me, I was on a break form WWE at this time, so this match amazed me. Flair turned the clock back 20 years in this match, but thayt didn't stop me from cringing when he fell through a table of fell off the ladder. I thought he was goging to croak at any given moment. Too much Lita interference again. Great match for both stars. 9/10

TLC match (John Cena Vs. Edge) Unforgiven 2006
This is another one of my personal favorites. I hate Cena, but I love Edge. Both guys were really great in this match, minus Cena looking lost, and messing a few moves up. Edge made up for his stupidity. This match was amazing, and action packed. Wrong guy won though. 10/10

Jeff Hardy Vs. Johnny Nitro
Jeff Hardy has always been one of my favorite, and Nitro is one of my current favorites. These 2 did really great in this match, and it was nice seeing new blood go toe to toe with a Hardy in a ladder match. nitro brought out the best in Hardy. 8.5/10

Fatal 4-way Ladder match for the WWE tag titles (Londrick Vs. Regal/Taylor Vs. MNM Vs. Hardy Boyz)
I loved seeing the Hardyz and Londrick square off, they would make the best feud. Regal and Taylor brought this match WAY down. MNM looked pretty good in that match. This was a nice action packed match, not as good as the TLCs but still a very nice match. I was glad to see Londrick win. Mercury got a terrible injury from this match. 8.5/10

This DVD is worth your money. Every match is worth watching, and some are worth watching many times, There were a few matches missing like Jeff Hardy Vs. RVD from Summerslam 2001 or Team Angle Vs. Eddie and Tajiri. It REALLY needed the triangle ladder match from WM 2000 and the ladder matc from WWX, but you still get a great listof matches. Why Todd Grisham hosted is beyond me. The blurring can be really annoying at times, but the action can hide it. If you notice, this was kinda a highlight of Edge's amazing career in WWE, from his tag days, to his midcard days, to his main eventing.

2701761,4,B000LC3IJ2,"I don't think I need to bore you with another review of each match, there is enough to read around here already.

What I will say is that this focus' on only WWF/E matches, and one WCW match.  The WCW did have some great matches with Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman which arenot anywhere to be seen here. They may not have been the best ladder matches of all time, but they where a lot better then the Undertaker VS Jeff Hardy match that has been included in this collection, which apart from the ladder being in the middle of the ring, it was hardly a great ""ladder"" match.

Also missing are the extreme ladder matches from the old ECW days. Perhaps Terry Funk pushing cactus jack off a ladder into a barbwire rope barricade and landmines was considered to violent for a WWE release? I think we would have enjoyed that match being included wouldn't we?

And I do not see why they did not include the first HBK vs Razor Ramon ladder match. It may not have been the first ever ladder match, but it's the match that really innovated the ladder match into the WWF, you only see a couple of highlights from it before the rematch they had that is shown on this dvd.

so, with matches missing, it can't be the perfect 5 star release.

Overall, the TLC matches are all included here, they are worth the price of purchase alone.",1188604800,,1318,4.337398373983739
2701762,5,B000LC3IJ2,"You already know what matches are on the dvd from other reviews so I'll just say it's great that they went all out with this dvd but there's still some good matches missing. Such as Eddie Guerrero vs X-Pac at NWO Souled Out (U.S title),  Chris Beniot vs Jeff Jarrett at Starcade (U.S Title) ""although we're lucky they didn't hold back the release of this dvd to take out the Beniot matches that are already on it"", The Money in the Bank Match that RVD won and the one that Kennedy won.

  Plus HBK's first Ladder match with Razor Ramon, both their Ladder matches could've been here since both are good. Goldberg also had a Ladder match with Scott Hall in WCW and that's not here either but I don't remember that one being too good. I remember Kurt Angle vs Chris Beniot in a Ladder match with the medals on the line but that might've been a 3 Stages of Hell match so that could be why it's on not here. But despite some matches missing this is a more sold WWE dvd than the WWE title match dvd. I hope they release a Vol 2 of the World Heavyweight Title History since a lot of good matches are missing and I'm not talking about John Cena matches ""snores"".",1186790400,3,1154,4.2318181818181815

1. Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter Ladder Match For The North American Heavywieght Championship and cash- Now I am not going to rip this match real bad but I will say it is not very good. We do not get to see the first 6 minutes of action as they already go halfway into the match. This was just to slow and the commentating and the type of ladder match just made it different and for me it was hard to enjoy. This was the first ever ladder match so I can understand why its on here so it is worth a wacth but besides that u can skip it. Winner Jake Roberts. Match Rating 2/10.
2. Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels Ladder Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship- Now this is were the dvd picks up. This was a lot better of a ladder match than the first one. This ladder match did not see so many crazy spots as there was a lot of technical wrestling. There were some nice spots but nothing to crazy like you will see today. Not a lot to say but you can never expect a match between hart and Michaels to be bad. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental Champ Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10.
3. Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon Ladder Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship- I was able to see there match at wrestlemania and that blew me away but this match right here was even better than that. This was given a good half hour and these two produced a classic match. There were tons of high flying action in this match and just a lot of sweet spots to remember forever. Great match. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental Champ Shawn Michaels. Match Rating 10/10.
4. HHH vs. The Rock WWF Ladder match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship- This was another very solid match. These two had a very nice feud going into this match and this one topped it all off. A lot of wrestling and some nice spots of the ladder including a suplex off it. It looked like HHH was going to lose when the rock through powder in t his eyes but Chyna low blowed the rock and he fell off the ladder. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental Champ HHH. Match Rating 8/10.
5. Edge and Christian vs. New Brood Terri Invitational Tournament Ladder Match- This was the first time these two teams met off in a ladder match. This match right here really changed the way the ladder match was. There was a lot of high flying action in this match. There were some nice spots including a spear from ladder to ladder. Very good match forthese teams. Winners New Brood. Match Rating 8/10.
6. Dudley Boyz vs. Edge and Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz First Ever TLC Match for the World Tag Team Championship- Now about a year later these teams met but this time the dudleys were added to the match. This match was absolutely off the chart. There were so many sick parts in this match. There were tons of vicious chair shots including a sick one to bubba Dudley. Another sweet part in the match was when Jeff Hardy tried a swanton bomb off a top of a 15 foot ladder but crashed through two tables below. Also Matt was about to grab the titles but was pushed backwards off a 15 foot ladder through a table. Awesome match. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs Edge and Christian. Match Rating 9.5/10.
7. 3 Count vs. Jung Dragons vs. Jamie Knoble and Evan Karhias Ladder Match for a Contract for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship- Now this was interesting as this added WCW into the Ladder Match DVD and this match did not disappoint. Now this one was a little different because it involved cruiserweight. This match was non stop high flying action and I will let you check this match out to see for yourself. Winners 3 Count. Match Rating 9/10.
8. Chris Beniot vs. Chris Jericho Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title- Now this was another great ladder match. This was just some hard hitting action. There were tons of nice spots including lots of suplexs on the ladders. Some good solid action but the best part was when Jericho locked in the walls of Jericho on the ladder. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental  Champ Chris Jericho. Match Rating 9/10.
9. Edge and Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz TLC Match for the World Tag Team Championships- Now I thought that there match at Summerslam 2000 was off the chain this one believe it or not is even better. Anyway there were just some nice spots including when Jeff Hardy Hit a Swanton bomb off the top of the ladder and put Rhino and Spike through a table. One of the sickest spots you will ever see in wrestling is when Edge hit Jeff Hardy with a spear off a 20 foot ladder. Also at the end Matt and Bubba got pushed off the top of the ladder through 4 tables. Winners and new World Tag Team Champs Edge and Christian. Match Rating 10/10.
10. Edge and Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Chris Beniot and Chris Jericho Fatal Four Way TLC Match for the World Tag Team Championships- Here yet again is another TLC match and even this one did not disappoint. The only downfall of having this on tv is we did not get to see the whole match but we got to see all the sick spots. This was also the first time 4 teams competed in a TLC match. Lots of good action here but the best part is when Jeff Hardy put a ladder between two tables and jumped over it and hit a leg drop on bubba that put him through the table. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs Chris Beniot and Chris Jericho. Match Rating 9/10.
11. Edge vs. Christian Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was a decent ladder match but a step down from what I was expecting. I was hoping for a 5 star match cause of how many matches they have been in it was still good but could have been better. There were some nice spots in this match including a reverse ddt off a ladder. At the end of the match Edge hit a sick conchairto on the top of the ladder. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ Edge. Match Rating 8/10.
12. Eddie Guerrero vs. RVD Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was another solid match and this type of match really worked well in RVD's favor. This just involved a lot of high flying action but also Eddie worked on RVD's leg a lot as there were tons of chair shots to the leg and the back of rvd. There were some nice moves including a rolling htunder attempt on the ladder but that missed. Rvd hit a splash off the top of the ladder which was sweet. Nice match. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ RVD. Match Rating 8.5/10.
13. Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy Ladder Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship- Now this was a little bit different. The match itself was solid. The match was supposed to be Hardy begin the underdog and would not give up no matter how much punishment he took. Nice match a lot controlled by taker. A sick chockslam off the top of the ladder was sweet. Winner and still Undisputed WWE Champ Undertaker. Match Rating 7.5/10.
14. Kane and The Hurricane vs. RVD and Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley vs. Chirs Jericho and Christian TLC Match for the World Tag Team Titles- This was another nice TLC match and the second one ever on tv and featured 4 teams. This match was very well paced there were some nice spots including a leg drop off a ladder by Jeff Hardy that put Kane through a table. Rvd also hit a sick Van terminator from corner to corner. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs Kane and The Hurricane. Match Rating 9/10.
15. Chris Jericho vs. Christian Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was a decent ladder match. Nothing new that we haven't seen before. For me I was not all that impressed by this match that might be just me not great but worth a look. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ Chris Jericho. Match Rating 7.5/10.
16. Chris Beniot vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Kane First Ever Money in the Bank Ladder Match- Now this was a great match to kick off the third disk. From the start I could tell this was going to be a good match. There were lots of nice moves including a T-Bone suplex off the top of the ladder. Also in the match Shelton hit a running clothesline running up the ladders one of the sickest things you will ever see. Also a nice head but off the top of the ladder from Chris Beniot. Winner Edge. Match Rating 9/10.
17. Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio Ladder Match for the Custody of Dominick- This was yet another solid match. This also told a good story that if rey lost he would ose custody of his son domincik to eddie. There were just some nice moves including a backdrop off the top of the ladder onto another ladder. Also the 3 amigos suplex on the ladder good fast pace action and you will enjoy this one. Winner Rey mysterio. Match Rating 8.5/10.
18. Edge vs. Matt Hardy Loser Leaves Raw Ladder Match- Now this was a different type of ladder match. These two also had a feud going for a lot of months over edge stealing lita. Usually when you have a ladder match unless it's a tlc match you will not see a lot of other weapons. This one had tables chairs and Kendo sticks. There were some nice spots in the match including a diving crossbody on Hardy through the table. Some nice Kendo stick shots as well. Decent match for tv. Winner Edge. Match Rating 7.5/10.
19. Edge vs. Rick Flair TLC Match for the WWE Championship- Now this match was off the chain for tv. I would have never thought in my life that rick flair would be in a TLC match and that it would be accualty good. This match had a lot of sick spots including a body splash off the top of the ladder from in the ring to the outside of the ring thorugh a table. Also inside the ring EDGE got backdropped off the ladder and went through the table. A sick suplex off the ladder on flair as well. Winner and still WWE Champ Edge. Match Rating 8.5/10.
20. John Cena vs. Edge TLC Match for the WWE Championship- This was yet another good match. These two have also had a feud on and off throughout the year. Great match here and the crowd was all behind edge and cena got booed out the bulding which adds to the match. Just some great spots that I will let you see but u have to check this out. Winner and new wwe champ John Cena. Match Rating 9/10.
21. Jeff Hardy vs. Jonny Nitro Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was a decent raw match. I think if you check it out you will like it as it is a very fast paced match and lots of high flying action thanks to jeff hardy. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ Jeff Hardy. Match Rating 8/10.
22. Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs. MNM vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. William Regal and Dave Taylor for the WWE TAG TEAM TITLES- This match was supposed to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs. Dave Taylor and William Regal in a normal match but it turned out to be 10 times better. This match was all over the place non stop action. In this match you will see one of the sickest shots to the face ever in your whole life on Joey Murcery of MNM it is sick. Winners and still WWE Tag Team Champs Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give the History of the Ladder Match a grade of 182/220 which is a 83% which means this is a perfect dvd. I really cant stress it enough that anyone that likes wrestling and the ladder match needs to pick up this dvd cause you cant lose. It is better than the history of the wwe title and I think if you don't watch it all at once you will like it more cause it could get boring. A great dvd pick it up and if you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate. Thanks for your time.",1184630400,12,11571,4.321527138914443

2701768,5,B000LC3IJ2,"Ladder matches are painful and fun to watch and this DVD doesn't disappoint.

Disc 1 -

1) Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter (Stampede Wrestling 1979): Not much of a match here as both wrestlers didn't utilize the ladder much at all and the pace was slow. However, the ladder that was used is quite humorous and is worth a look.

2) Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels (1992): Decent action all around, but HBK didn't utilize the ladder as well as he would have later on his career.

3) Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon (Summerslam 1995): Great chemistry displayed by both wrestlers when they are actually wrestling, and some good spots when they used the ladder.

4) Triple H vs. The Rock (Summerslam 1998): The Rock lays the smack down on Triple H and Triple H does the same. Great match.

5) Edge & Christian vs. New Brood (No Mercy 1999): Fast-paced action with great uses of the ladder. A classic.

6) Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz (1st Ever TLC Match Summerslam 2000): THIS IS THE BEST MATCH ON THIS 3 DISC COLLECTION! This match was out of control from the very beginning. Lots of ""ow!"" moments plus three ABSOLUTELY SICK spots. Bubba Ray Dudley flies through four tables! Jeff Hardy does a Swanton Bomb off a 20 foot ladder and goes through a table. Matt Hardy falls off the ladder inside the ring and lands outside on a table. This match was ridiculous and I was surprised all of these guys made it out without any serious injuries.

7) 3 Count vs. Jung Dragons vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias (WCW, Starrcade 2000): Good action with an innovative use of some ladders at the end.

8) Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho (Royal Rumble 2001): An average ladder match , but one of the best spots I've ever seen when Benoit flies through the ropes to spear Jericho, but Jericho nails him with a chair.

Disc 2 -

1) Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz (TLC II, Wrestlemania 17): Had about the same results as the first TLC match, but Matt Hardy and Bubba Ray both go through four tables this time! Jeff Hardy once again does a Swanton Bomb off a 20 Foot Ladder (how can he still wrestle?). Rhino, Spike Dudley, and Lita all get involved in this match and all do some nice spots. Another TLC match, another trainwreck!

2) Edge & Christian vs. Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz (Smackdown 2001): This is a Smackdown match, but with PPV action! This is the match where Benoit breaks his neck after doing a diving headbutt outside the ring. Fast-paced action with good bumps = success.

3) Christian vs. Edge (No Mercy 2001): This was a disappointing match since it was very slow-paced. There were some nice spots at the end, but overall mediocre.

4) Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam (Raw 2002): Another TV match with PPV action. Good action with RVD taking a lot of painful bumps and Eddie at point does a nice athletic spot off the top of the ladder.

5) Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy (Raw 2002): Taker takes some damage from the ladder, but Jeff Hardy gets punished for most of the match. Taker admires Jeff's courage at the end of the match.

6) Kane & The Hurricane vs. RVD & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray Dudley & Spike Dudley vs. Chris Jericho & Christian (Raw 2002): The Hurricane wasn't in this match. Good PPV action here with Jeff Hardy doing yet another Swanton Bomb off the top of a ladder outside the ring.

7) Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Unforgivin 2004): Decent action with Jericho doing most of the good work.

Disc 3 -

1) Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Kane (1st Ever Money in the Bank Ladder Match, Wrestlemania 21): Shelton Benjamin stole the show here doing some really athletic moves including the Spiderman jump onto the ladder out of nowhere. Great action and lots of sick bumps makes this a classic.

2) Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio (Summerslam 2005): Great chemistry by both wrestlers with some innovative uses of the ladder not seen on the first two discs.

3) Edge vs. Matt Hardy (Raw 2005): This match was fast-paced from the very beginning and they do some nice spots too. Great effort by both wrestlers.

4)Edge vs. Ric Flair (TLC match, Raw 2006): Decent action, but made entertaining with Ric Flair's crimson mask and a good table spot.

5) John Cena vs. Edge (Unforgiven 2006): I knew Edge would do his part in this match, but was unsure of Cena. Cena ended up suprising me with some sweet spots off the ladder. At the end, Cena does the FU on Edge from a ladder and Edge goes through two tables!

6) Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro (Raw 2006): Good action when Jeff Hardy is doing his thing, but the match slowed down when Nitro was in control. However, Nitro did a good job of receiving some punishment.

7) Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. MNM vs. Hardys vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor (Armageddon 2006): Great action delivered by everyone with some sick bumps, including Joey Mercury getting his nose broken after getting it destroyed via a ladder! He rolled to the outside of the ring where blood was pouring everywhere and his face was just a mess. That definitely was not fake!

Overall, this is one of the best WWE DVDs to come out and it's well worth the money. The replay value is high.",1182902400,,5215,4.492063492063492
2701769,5,B000LC3IJ2,"I viewed this DVD with interest and found it very satisfying.  The ladder matches were shown in their entirety without cuts or editing.  However, sadly, it does not include what was, perhaps, the first ladder match in professional wrestling.  This occurred in 1962 when Ray ""Blond Bomber"" Stevens (also known as ""The Crippler"") went against Pepper Gomez at San Francisco's Cow Palace.  For this angle, Stevens delivered his vaunted Bombs Away knee drop from off the top of the ladder landing on Gomez's throat to win the match.  This was an electrifying moment for the fans which certainly helped to set the tenor for Stevens' dominance in the Bay Area as top heel during the entire 1960s decade.  The reason for not including this match in the set was probably due to no available film of the match in any archives, which I think is very sad.",1182902400,,843,4.700680272108843
2701770,5,B000LC3IJ2,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best WWE videos I've ever owned, and I've been buying them since 1990!  Every match is shown in it's entirety, including wrestler entrances.  You'll get to see old school classics like HBK vs Bret Hart from July 1992, HBK vs Razor Ramon (Scott Hall) at SummerSlam 1995, and Rock vs Triple H at SummerSlam 1998.

You also get some of the best TLC matches with Edge & Christian, The Dudleyz, and The Hardyz.  They even included recent matches like the first Money in the Bank from Wrestlemania 21 and Edge vs John Cena at Unforgiven 2006.

So they basically included every classic ladder match from the mid-70's to the present time, except for matches that we've all seen a million times (like HBK vs Razor Ramon from Wrestlemania 10).  I think there are 21 total matches.  This video is less than $20 but I probably would have paid triple that amount, because the quality of the matches on this DVD is simply outstanding.  THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR EVERY WWE FAN - GET IT NOW!!!",1181260800,5,1011,4.456521739130435
2701771,5,B000LC3IJ2,"Hearing of this release a few months back, I was skeptical.  I know that since WWE acquired WCW and ECW, it has only shown a small dose of what they have to offer.  The ECW DVD's are the greatest example with great matches, but still lacking.  I buy this on the hope it's great, given it's advertised with great matches.  The first match on it sucks, but I think they put it there to show how it evolved from a crappy match with Junkyard Dog and Jake Roberts all the way to main event status for The Hardys, Dudles, Edge/Christian and even Jericho.  So far, I'm only half way into watching it, but so far, the best match on here is the only WCW one with 'Shane' Helms and Shannon Moore (even has a young Jamie Noble and Jimmy Wang Yang).  This DVD is by far the best compilation DVD that WWE has released to date.  A must buy for those fans who can handle the hardcore, brutal and ruthless matches it offers.",1181088000,,908,4.213872832369942
2701772,5,B000LC3IJ2,"Every time I watch a WWE DVD I get the feeling that something's missing. ""If only this match or that match were on here."" It's always debatable what should be on a DVD. Not with this one. I got it, watching it right now, love it. Period. Name a big name and he's likely on here: Undertaker (I forgot he had a ladder match, but let's face it, it was to spotlight JHardy), HBK, RVD, The Rabid Wolverine, The Rock, Triple H, Bret Hart, the usual Ladder suspects (Edge & Christian, The Hardys, the Dudleys) and my main man Chris Jericho (since WWE did nothing as far as a DVD to highlight his career antics since the ""Break Down The Walls"" VHS, I have to find him where I can. It's always good to see ol' Y2J).

I really don't know how else to say that this is a DVD worth the money. I'm rebuilding my wrestling DVD collection and this is definitely a main eventer here. AND I'M NOT EVEN DONE WATCHING THE FIRST DISC.

The segments with Todd Grisham were cool. He spoke with Shawn Michaels, Edge, Jeff Hardy, etc. The way they were done were not over the top; I got the impression that WWE wanted the matches to speak for themselves and the commentary and appearances were to enhance the experience as opposed to the usual ""hey, look it's me, now buy the DVD since I'm on it with my catch phrase.""

Another thing was that the WrestleMania ladder matches were referred to, but not shown in their entirety. I guess WWE caught on that fans are only gonna buy they same repackaged stuff for so long. I didn't even know that HBK and Razor Ramon had a second ladder match. These are the matches that need to be shown.

I'm done. Time to pop in disc two.",1181088000,,1643,4.256410256410256
2701773,5,B000LC3IJ2,"WWE really put out a great dvd. 21 matches with all the TLC matches, good Raw and Smackdown matches, and even a WCW match. A few quick thoughts: Gregory Helms promoting WCW? Is WWE bringing that back as well? They should have had Sandman come on and talk about his ladder matches. While TLC are always excellent, Sandman had alot of excellent ladder matches in ECW. Anybody remember them? Todd Grisham should not host anther WWE dvd, he made the dvd seem childish. Reminds me of Todd Pettingal. (sorry for the spelling)",1181088000,,519,4.6521739130434785

8160768,4,B000LC3IJ2,"The only thing I really didn't like or get is why didn't they put the Shawn Michaels vs Razor Ramon Wrestlemania 10 Ladder Match on this disc? It appears on vol. 2 but should have been on vol. 1 because afterall, that match is where it all began for WWE (WWF back then) setting the tone for all superstars to raise the bar in this type of match. Other than that, there may be a few matches selected that might not catch your interest. But as an overall majority, there are more than enough worth watching for sure! The Hardy boys appear in 90% of the dvd as tag team and single stars elevating their game each time they fight whether it's against: The Dudley's, Edge and Christian, Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho or MNM (Mercury, Nitro and Melina), they hold their own. One of the best matches on the dvd is: The Rock vs HHH for the Intercontinental Title back in 1998 in Madison Square Garden during the time frame of when they both were up and coming setting the tone for tough acts to follow from that point forth throughout the rest of their careers. During the match, The Rock who was a huge heel (bad guy) at that time gained so much respect from the crowd that he went from being hated to being loved and cheered louder than HHH who at that time was an overwhelmingly obvious babyface (fan favorite). The match ended with Chyna, (God rest her soul), who was in HHH's corner hitting Rock between the legs as he climbed the ladder for the belt moments after Mark Henry, who was in The Rock's corner, threw white powder in HHH's face blinding him preventing him from seeing the belt and climbing the ladder higher to get it. Other classics on the dvd include: Rob Van Dam vs Eddie Guerrero on Monday Night Raw going hard making the crowd cheer their every move. Too many to name but definitely worth the price of admission.",1482364800,,1825,4.386430678466077

8160772,5,B000LC3IJ2,"I barely see some ladder matches when I was growing up in the 90's But l'm happy I get to see them all in the DVD. And I'll tell you what Shawn Michaels may have started the ladder match in the early 1990's, but in the beginning of the 21th century, the Hardy brothers are the kings.",1439510400,,283,3.982456140350877
8160773,5,B000LC3IJ2,"This is a wicked sweet dvd compilation of the best of Ladder Matches(well some of the best) and TLC matches. This is a great mix of some really violent matches,ranging from the very first ever ladder match with Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter in 1979 on a 1 sided ladder(it's an ok match) then fast forward to 1992 with Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels which was really well done. 1995 Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon is 1 of the most notorious ladder matches ever,and it's really a thrill to watch.
1998 HHH vs. The Rock is pretty sweet because neither of them are really specialists of the ladder match,but it is good too watch nonetheless.
1999 Edge&Christian vs. New Brood(Hardy Boys) is a really sick match,really violent with lots of high flying maneuvers.
2000 Dudleys vs. Edge&Christian vs. Hardy Boys TLC match(first ever) and wow is this an intense match,here is where the dvd starts to pick up. Fatal 4 way match for WCW Cruiserweight contract match is pretty damn sweet too.
2001 Benoit vs. Jericho for Intercontinental title is a really technical wrestling match with great action.
Disc 2 Wrestlemania 17-2001 Edge&Christian vs. Dudleys vs. Hardys,this is an INSANE match that everyone considers the first TLC match. Wicked action and lots of really nasty attacks and falls,lots of high-flying action(1 of my favorites on the dvd boxset)
2001 Fatal 4 way TLC Tag title match Edge&Christian vs. Jericho&Benoit vs. Dudleys vs. Hardys....this...is....insane ! Seriously,lots of violence and high flying action & Benoit hurts himself badly.
2001 Ladder match Christian vs. Edge is an alright match but
watchable.
2002 Eddie Guerrero vs. RVD this is sick,the battle of the frog-
splash. Really intense stuff here,another technical match.
2002 Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy-this is a brutal match but you
gotta respect Jeff's resiliance and determination,a solid match. This isn't Takers ""yard"" but he makes it his own,really brutal & awesome.
2002 TLC Match for tag-titles Kane&Hurricane vs. RVD&Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba&Spike Dudley vs. Jericho&Christian this is another insane match with bodies everywhere,Kane did his best solo cuz Hurricane gets taken out early.
2004 Ladder match Intercontinental title Jericho vs Christian is alright,i just thought they could have put more into it but great nonetheless.
Disc 3- First ever Money in the Bank match Benoit vs. Jericho vs. Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Kane is really sweet and high flying,Shelton Benjamin really shined here he did some pretty sick stuff & so did Kane.
2005 Ladder match for custody of Dominick-Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio,the angle they used is really low but in the end Mysterio got the win,really intense match.
2005 Loser leaves Raw Edge vs. Matt Hardy-We all know how it ends but Matt did a damn good job,if it weren't for Lita's interferrance things woulda ended different.
2006 TLC Match Edge vs. Ric Flair is just downright brutality,Flair ends up a bloody mess but does great.
2006 TLC Match Cena vs Edge- this is such a good match,John Cena does excellent for his first ever Ladder Match,he takes the win and destroys Edge(another 1 of my favorites)
2006 Ladder match Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro is a high flying match,Jeff dominates and really shows he is the master of the Ladder match. He takes alot of risks but they pay off,Jeff is a wicked good wrestler.
2006 Fatal 4 way Paul London&Brian Kendrick vs. MNM vs. Hardys vs. William Regal&Dave Taylor-this is a killer match with lots of insane stunts and attacks.
All in all this is a 5 star dvd set because the matches here are sick regardless of who is in them,every match is really dangerous & they don't disappoint. Every single match is loaded with violence to the max,lots of insane stuff and really really crazy stunts(especially Hardys)
The dvd set is sick & part 2 of the Ladder Match dvd(Crash&Burn) is awesome as well,but this set is waayyy better. This is for fans of some of the most insane,high flying and violent matches especially for the style matches they are(Ladder,TLC) They don't disappoint at all. WWE did great here and they are pumping out dvd sets of every sort & style you can think of. That's just their way of retaking money from people,however this set is top notch. The only annoying thing is the fact that they blur out the WWF logo on the ring,the camera men shirts and the tables. It is annoying when there about to do a sick stunt or a dive outside the ring the blur follows them and covers up the action. Nonetheless i suggest you get this if your a fan of ladder matches,or the crazy PPV style stuff. This will not disappoint any fans. Go buy it !",1433548800,,4633,4.836272040302267
