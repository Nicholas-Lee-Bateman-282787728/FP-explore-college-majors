1900501,3,B0000A0DWN,"While I agree with the previous reviewer's comments on the disappointing technical quality of this disc--or at least the source material--I still found ""The Hoodlum"" an interesting way of spending 60 minutes. This 1951 ""B"" movie will still appeal to fans of old gangster flicks and ""films noir"".

The plot is familiar. Vincent Lubeck is a career criminal, and definitely the ""black sheep"" of his family. Because of Vincent's numerous crimes, and prison sentences, we are told that his father ""died of a broken heart"". His mother is in a constant state of worry, and his younger brother, Johnny, holds him in contempt. He is paroled from prison because of his mother's pleadings, but Vincent has no real interest in ""going straight"", even though his brother gives him a job at his gas station. Contacting some of his old cronies, Vincent plans and carries out a bank heist--a heist that results in several fatalities. A showdown with the police seems inevitable--but perhaps there are ""family issues"" to be settled first.

Lawrence Tierney is terrific as Vincent. This man is a thug, a thief, a liar, a rapist and a killer--a soulless, remorseless excuse for a human being. Mr. Tierney is totally convincing in this role, although in films like ""Dillinger"" and ""Born To Kill"", you could say that he had plenty of practice ! Other screen ""tough guys"" of the forties and fifties are still remembered today--Alan Ladd, Dan Duryea and, of course, Cagney and Bogart--except with genre fans, Lawrence Tierney seems to be forgotten, which is a shame. Certainly, in this type of role, the man had real presence.

Lawrence Tierney's brother, Edward, plays Johnny Lubeck--an interesting piece of casting, although his performance is no more than adequate. Lisa Golm, as Lubeck's mother, has several strong scenes--her final one with the ""son from Hell"" is a pip !

Again, the black and white, full-screen picture has much ""wear and tear"", even a few scene jumps, clearly taken from an old, flawed print. I suppose it beats having no film at all. Don't look for extras.

If you can overlook the technical quality, ""The Hoodlum"" is a very diverting, if somewhat bleak, hour's entertainment. For this viewer at least, Mr. Tierney is worth the ""price of admission"".",1142380800,7,2250,4.957559681697613
1900502,1,B0000A0DWN,"I was so looking forward to watching this DVD. After finding this unknown film noir, I noticed it was issued by Image. Anyone familiar with their products knows by now that purchasing from Image is hit and miss in terms of quality. This one is clearly not remastered - or even restored in any way. In fact, the print is plagued in numerous spots from where the film print had broken and then was spliced together with a few damaged frames at each splice being removed. When oh when will Image have a consistant quality of product? This could have been a delighful purchase has been turned into a lesson not to buy any more DVDs from this company!",1138838400,10,646,4.436974789915967
1900503,1,B0000A0DWN,"Lawrence Tierney is one of my very favrotie performers, and even I couldn't watch this movie.  The print is  awful; the sound is worse; and it frequently skips right past some of the dialogue.

It's not a good movie to begin with, and doesn't really showcase Tierney's talent. It has no real plot, and you don't care about any of the characters except Tierney's long suffering mother, who winds up dying from his very presence, a little eerie in view of the fact that LT's real life mother committed suicide.

You've never seen any of the other performers (unless you're a 3 Stooges fan) or heard of any of the behind the scenes folk, and it's easy to see why.

This is not a B movie.  It's firmly ensconced in the D- category, and  yet it's  spectacular in comparison to the DVD version of it. No features.  No labeling of scenes. Scratchy, horrible print. Cover picture that doesn't even resemble the performers.

Cheap, cheap, cheap.  They don't come any cheaper.

No more ALPHA videos for me.

1900511,3,B0000A0DWN,"Like a lot of movie watchers of my generation, my familiarity with Lawrence Tierney comes from his crime boss role in ""Reservoir Dogs"". This pot-boiler is the first full movie of his early career that I've seen. He plays Vincent Lubeck, a hard-luck petty criminal, fresh out of the stir and on parole, thanks to some earnest begging from his mom to the warden and parole board. His straight-arrow younger brother gives Lubeck a job at his gas station, but it's nearly impossible for Lubeck to stay out of trouble. He rapes his brother's girlfriend, and when he sees that the gas station is across the street from a bank, he plans a heist of the cash being delivered to it, while seducing a female bank manager. But in this tight morality tale of a bad guy who stays bad, things don't go as planned for our antihero. Tierney is great at playing a fellow who wants to be more than he is but cannot control his destructive impulses enough to be even successful as a gangster. Vincent Lubeck is exactly what the movie's title says he is, a hoodlum, nothing more.

It's also noteworthy that we see that the only thing jail has accomplished was to make Lubeck a more experienced criminal, rather than a penitent wanting to turn his life around. Tierney makes this character watchable through his charisma and sense of fatalism, and we see a glimmer of his humanity when facing his dying mother, following the bank robbery.

I'm giving this three stars due to some editing that chopped up some scenes, seemingly random in the cuts. But it's a solid, hard-boiled narrative, and Tierney carries the picture.",1464998400,3,1598,4.663120567375887

The movie holds your interest. It moves at a good pace with some interesting plot twists, and some action. The cast, the script, and the production are all five-star quality. However, the film left me empty in the end. Lawrence Tierney's character is helped by his family at great inconvenience and financial burden to them. Yet, he is ungrateful. He takes his family for granted. He eventually does them harm for his own selfish and wicked desires. The film is a tragedy with no uplifting moments. Apparently; the moral of the story is ""Do not try to help an ungrateful person; even if he is your brother or your son"".",1457568000,2,848,4.6158940397351

1900522,5,B0000A0DWN,"This movie needs some TLC restoration, but overall, it was great to see.  Over two years ago a group of friends started to get together to watch Valentino movies, then branched out to silents and early talkies, and now we are in film noir.  Who knew ""Resevoir Dogs"" Joe Cabot [Lawrence Tierney] was ever such a gorgeous!  So far we have watched him in ""Dillinger"", ""Born to Kill"", ""Devil Thumbs a Ride"" (my personal favorite), ""Bodyguard""  and now ""Hoodlum.""  Interestingly, Lawrence Tierney's younger brother (nine years his junior) appears in this movie with him, playing the character's younger brother.  Edward Tierney was twenty-three in this film.  We've been doing a lot of reading about Lawrence Tierney, amazingly he outlived both is actor brothers, Scott Brady and Edward Tierney (aka Edward Tracy).  We think this amazing as he had a serious drinking problem and a propensity toward violence when intoxicated.  It's all rather sad too, as in addition to being OMG handsome [until his face became a mass of scars from the repeated bar fights] Lawrence Tierney really could act!",1407715200,2,1087,5.027932960893855
1900523,4,B0000A0DWN,"Released in 1951, ""The Hoodlum"" is a cheap, 61 minute B film about an unredeemable incorrigible criminal, Vincent Lubeck, played be the famous almost incorrigible actor, Lawrence Tierney (1919 -- 2002). Max Nossek (1902 -- 1972) was the director.  Tierney's brother Edward had a rare movie role as Vincent's brother Edward.  The film shows no character development and develops little or no sympathy for its anti-hero.  Vincent Lubeck is portrayed as villainous from beginning to end.

The film tells the story of a gangster, but because of its focus on night, guilt, and self-laceration, it passes for film noir. The Lubecks were a family of immigrants who lived near the city dump. Vincent Lubeck had been in trouble with the law since his early teens. He is serving a 5-10 year sentence for armed robbery when his tearful mother persuades the parole board to give her son a chance and thus secures his early release.

Edward Lubeck had been trying to make something of his life by using the proceeds of the father's insurance policy to make a down payment on a gas station, by taking care of his mother, and by courting a young woman, Rosa, (Allen Roberts) whom he hopes to marry. The reluctant Edward takes his brother on as a worker in the station, but Vincent will have none of it.  He makes plans to hold up an armored car that services the bank across the street instead.  In the course of his planning, Vincent seduces Rosa and gets her pregnant.  She commits suicide.

The movie shows Lubeck's relationship with his mother, brother, companions in crime, Rosa, and another woman, Eileen, who works at the bank, as he plans and works to execute the heist. The climactic moment occurs in a scene between Lubeck and his ailing mother who realizes at last that Lubeck is incorrigible and would better have been left in prison.  She has a heart attack and dies before a final confrontation between Lubeck and his brother.

Film critic and professor Wheeler Winston Dixon described ""The Hoodlum"" as ""a damned film, a doomed film, a cheap and rotten film about a cheap and rotten world."" Dixon writes further:

""Its hard to imagine a more bleak, depressing, or unrelenting film than The Hoodlum.
The film shocks even the contemporary viewer not only in its relentlessly downbeat story structure, but also in the cheapness of its execution, the complete absence of any directorial flourishes, and its utter absence of any sort of hope of redemption. Vincent Lubeck destroys everything and everyone he touches, and the film simply documents his downward spiral into the gutter, as he takes everyone who cares for him with him""
(quotation from Dixon's review on ""Film Noir of the Week"")

Lawrence Tierney's in-character, raw acting, and quick pace, and the unremitting nature of the melodrama make the film worth seeing.

""The Hoodlum"" is in the public domain and readily accessible. It has been shown recently at ongoing festivals of film noir. The film will appeal to fans of Lawrence Tierney and to those with a strong interest in film noir or in raw gangster films.

1900524,5,B0000A0DWN,"Much like his character in DILLINGER, this is a grade B film with no name stars except for Lawrence Tierney and Allene Roberts, the latter playing a love-sick teenager who is in love with Tierney's BROTHER!  Of course, Tierney wreaks havoc in his mother's household.  Not telling the conclusion,  the film is a black and white stunner and worth watching for Tierney's performance alone.

1900529,4,B0000A0DWN,"The Hoodlum, 1951 film

The film begins with two men in a car driving somewhere in the night. We hear about Vincent Lubeck's crimes. He will be paroled after his mother meets the parole board. The warden warns Vincent. His brother Johnny owns a gas station. [Does Vincent have a good attitude?] Vincent can't keep his mind on his work. Should Johnny help his brother? Rosa thinks she can help Vincent. [Can anyone?] ""What did it accomplish?"" Eileen drives a Rambler. Vincent has plans for a Big Score with other crooks. Rosa Chermak has a problem, there will be an autopsy. A funeral car doesn't have to stop for lights. Vince gets an idea. His gang scouts the bank. Will the plan work?

They rob the armored car and shoot the guards. They leave the cab and transfer to the hearse for a funeral. The police will blockade the roads in the city and shoot to kill. But funeral cars are allowed to pass. The lieutenant questions the mortuary owner and notices a discrepancy. There is a squabble over sharing the loot. Is there honor and trust among thieves? The police catch the rest of the gang. What will Vincent do? Can he escape? ""Its too late."" His mother speaks to him. Is she heart-broken? Johnny speaks to him and commands obedience. The police arrive to end the story.

This is a very good story for a low-budget production. The Lubeck family didn't know when it was time to cut their losses.",1263513600,2,1397,4.535714285714286
1900530,5,B0000A0DWN,"Film noir is a genre characterized by sinister themes, high drama  bordering on melodrama, severa camera angles, high contrast, action at the expense of dialogue (and when there is dialogue, it's often loaded with terse 40's-50's slang and sexual double-entendre), an insistent score, and logs of sleaze, but often with a semi-redemptive figure.

The variation is in the quality of the production and the fame and ability of the cast, cinematographer, screenwriter, and director. ""Classic"" film noir examples (such as ""Maltese Falcon,"" ""The Big Sleep,"" ""Double Indemnity,"" ""The Killing"") display excellence in all or most of these areas, and are deservedly famous.

However, there is another type of film noir, the B (or B grade) film, obviously made on a budget, and typically hugely deficient in one or more of the above areas. There may be name actors and actresses (although sometimes they're here because of contractual obligations or a flagging career), but they don't have uniformly high quality, and there's often a dirtier, sleazier feeling that a cheaper, less sanitized film can get away with. ""The Hoodlum"" is one of these B films noirs, and within its often implausible plot and sometimes ridiculous characters, it delivers a raw power that today would be described as ""edgy.""

Lawrence Tierney embodies the power of the best B noirs, as just-released convict Vincent Lubeck, he's an unpretty, unsentimental, snarling, brutal man with no redemptive features (save for his very last-minute remorse during the tense but predictable ending).  He's riveting as the single-minded psychopath, and the lousy feeling of the sets and clothes make him even more credible. (Even the current promotion of the DVD--perhaps taken from original promotional material--is sleaze, the scene depicted on the cover never takes place.)

The B noir is also very forgiving, given the right expectations, one can laugh at the production quality, the less convincing aspects of the plot, and the maudlin or otherwise unconvincing acting. This plot's a doozy, the brooding Lubeck and fellow ex-cons rob a bank across the street from where Vince works at his brother's gas station. Even though parole agents visit him there, they fail to make a connection, nor take notice of Lubeck's outings with a bank employee. I enjoyed, however, the sorry gang that Lubeck gathers, the immigrant mother who believes in Vincent (she successfully falls upon the mercy of the parole board, who do an about-face after her tearful plea... 'He's a good boy!'), the brother's beautiful and idealistic fiancee, and the ambitious bank employee whose lust is the only explanation for her attraction to Lubeck.

Tierney's compelling and completely natural ""hoodlum"" seems years ahead of its time, and he's the reason this is a tawdry, rough-cut gem. If you can accept the movie's sometimes cliched, low aspirations, and especially if you're either a film or noir afficionado, you'll enjoy it.",1246838400,2,2956,5.25

Nothing but heartache and death follow. Tierney plays a really good jerk :)
It reminded me of Invisible Stripes, but it is not as good. Another film that sounded good,but was just run of the mill when I saw it.
