230235,4,6300213730,"Although his present career may be waning Eddie Murphy will always be remembered for his role as Axel Foley, narcotics detective. Sadly it may also be due to films such as this that the paying public will never see him  as a serious actor. Despite these negative aspects Murphys performance in  this rip roaring satire on the Beverley Hills lifestyle never fails to  raise a smirk and possibly a little envy. To remind those readers who may  have forgotten the plot Murphy plays an out of state detective, Alex Foley,  who travels to Los Angeles in his leave time, and against his superiors  direct orders, to suss out the suspicious death of a close friend.  Inevitably he meets up with his dead mates former associates and along the  way uncovers a drug smuggling ring. Enough said.
Although Eddie is the  star of the show and does a good turn he is unforgettably upstaged in two  memorable scenes. The first is with ""the banana man"" at the  hotel, Damon Wayans in a brief but comedic cameo. Thank God he went on to  better things. The second is with Bronson Pinchots character Serge, the  gallery assistant. For the life of me I couldn't fathom his accent or his  gender, but it will never be forgotten. He had so much potential. Oh well.  It is also where Judge Rheinhold makes his big supporting actor debut. I  always found it amazing how two straight actors like Stephen Elliot &  John Ashton managed to keep such straight faces working with such  characters as Murphy & Rheinhold. Lisa Eilbacher also gives us a solid  performance as does Steven Berkoff as the arch villain. A role he seems to  have been typecast in to. The upbeat pumping soundtrack also deserves  honourable mention. I never bothered to view the sequels because I knew  they would be disappointing, and they were if one believes the reviews.  Eddie Murphy may never top the success of BHC but even if he does I will  still always remember him for this film. Not a bad first time effort for a  23 year old black comedian.",959040000,17,1997,4.589235127478753

230238,5,6300213730,Eddie uses his funny nature and sharp wit to avenge a friends death. 2 hoodlums come from los angeles to Detroit looking for a thief (eddie's friend) who stole from their company. The 2 hoodlums catch up to him and  187 him. After this non stop laughter and drama. truly a great piece of  work.,930700800,,294,4.327272727272727

230240,5,6300213730,"This movie is, without a doubt, one of the most hilarious I have ever seen.  Eddie Murphy dives into the role of Axel Foley with such a vengeance that it shows.  Enjoy the scenes where Foley leads the cops astray (the  strip bar scene is a riot!)-they'll prepare you for the scenes when Judge  Reinhold and Co. ditch rigid, by-the-book Beverly Hills policing and try on  law enforcement-Axel Foley style.

230837,4,6300213730,"While this still has its share of fun moments -- all due to Eddie Murphy and Bronson Pinchot in his now legendary cameo as Serge, and one really great car chase  -the film has lost something over the years.  The actual plot feels like a last minute after thought, no more interesting and surprising than a mediocre network TV cop show episode.  And whenever Murphy isn't doing a bit, the air goes out of the film pretty fast.  Add to that the ungodly 80s score, and the fact that most of the most memorable moments already stick in ones mind from seeing it years ago, this didn't have much replay value for me 30 years later.  That said, If youve never seen it, its definitely worth seeing once - the highlights are terrific -  but Id rent it, not buy it.",1460419200,,755,4.319148936170213

The stark contrast between both communities ensures a clash of styles and personalities, but the clever and energetic Foley slips out of tight situations always smiling. Good old fashion police work and cutting a few corners ensures Foley sniffs out the right leads and laughs his way closer to the truth.

231139,5,6300213730,"Beverly Hills Cop (1984) stars Eddie Murphy as, Axel Foley, a fast-talking, streetwise Detroit cop who goes to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of a close friend. He meets up with a fetching high school friend (Lisa Eilbacher) and encounters a handful of Beverly Hills police (Judge Reinhold, John Ashton and Ronny Cox ) while zeroing in on the wicked culprit (Steven Berkoff).

Murphys role was originally intended for Sylvester Stallone, who dropped out two weeks before filming was to commence because the producers insisted that Stallones ideas were over-budget. A couple days later Eddie signed on resulting in massive rewrites to include his witty comedic flair. Despite these last-minute changes everything clicks for a great mid-80s cop thriller/comedy. The movie went on to become the #1 film in the USA in 1984 and #2 worldwide.

Seeing it 31 years later (as of this writing) its clearly a product of its timee.g. the music and stylesbut its greatness still shines. Whats so great about this film? Of course theres Eddie's comic genius, but theres so much more: The great Axel F instrumental by Harold Faltermeyer; the way the movie expertly meshes serious drama/action with excellent comedic elements; Mikeys surprising and potent expression of love for his friend; Axels loyalty at all costs spirit; the theme of being different in a world that demands conformity; trying to understand how your colleagues think or work in order to solve a case; the great camaraderie that develops amongst the protagonists; Axels acceptance once he proves hes the real deal; looking beyond outer gruffness to see inner greatness; Lisas perky cuteness; the warmth the viewer feels for the protagonists as the story progresses; and more.

Movies like Top Gun and The Karate Kid are similarly classic 80s, but for some reason those movies remain watchable in their 80s sort of way while watching this one in 2015 basically ruined all the good memories that I had of this flick.",1424304000,,549,4.352941176470588

231532,5,6300213730,"Eddie Murphy plays a street-wise Detroit cop whose best friend Mikey is murdered in the hallway outside Axel's apartment. The murder appears to be a 'hit"" and German bonds are found on Mikey. Axel is told by his captain in very clear terms, that Axel is not part of the investigation and he is *not* to go out on his own investigating the matter. Axel wants justice for his friend and takes his vacation time to visit Los Angeles. In LA, Mikey was a security guard at an art gallery in LA and Axel suspects his death is somehow associated with the art gallery.

Axel meets with Mikey's girlfriend and also goes to visit Victor Maitland, the gallery owner to confront him about Mikey's murder. Alex is roughed up, thrown through glass windows, and arrested for trespassing. At the LA Police station, wise-cracking Axel gets punched in the stomach by one of the Sergeants who then must apologize to him after *his* captain checks out and verifies Axel's story about being a Detroit cop is true. However, Sergeant Taggert and Detective Billy Rosewood are assigned to follow Foley around to keep him in check. Foley manages to allude them and also pulls a few tricks one of which includes successfully preventing a robbery at a striptease bar all of which comes to the attention of Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil. A different set of police are assigned to follow Foley due to this mishap. Although, the first two LA policemen are removed they develop a trust and respect for Axel Foley despite of his disseminating explanations and less than above board investigative techniques.

Foley gets Detective Billy Rosewood to accompany him to the Art Gallery's warehouse to check out its contents since they do not have enough hard evidence for a search warrant. Jenny Mikey's girlfriend also participates in the search. Foley finds coffee grounds in a boxed crate which are a proven method of throwing off the drug sniffing dogs from smelling the cocaine and other narcotics. Foley also finds the cocaine but is apprehended by Maitland's men. Axel Foley is rescued by Det. Billy Rosewood but Jenny is taken prisoner to Maitland's mansion. Sgt Taggert is trying to locate Foley and Rosewood and tracks them to the mansion. He unwittingly participates in the attempts to rescue Jenny once he learns of the narcotics smuggling. This film is totally enjoyable from start to finish. It is hilarious and the action is outstanding. Eddie Murphy is perfect as the smart-mouth, street-wise cop who bends the rules to achieve justice. Very funny film, much better than I expected! Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1422230400,,2585,4.886104783599089

Keep in mind this movie was released in 1984, prior to Hollywood being completely politically correct.  This movie points out some of the stupidity of political correctness.  If you can laugh at yourself then you probably don't mind some cliche fun poking at others.  If so then you'll like this movie.  I love Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Monty Python.  If you don't like those movies then you probably won't like this one.  This is more serious than any of those.  It has solid acting, a well written script, 80s style clothes, hair and cars.",1409961600,,665,4.672413793103448

Was definitely a trip back to the 80s. Big hair. Shoulder pads. Excess. Money. Extravagance. Etc. Was a decent plot. Easy to flow. Interesting. And I must say Eddie Murphy was a better actor than I would have imagined. How the black culture that is prevalent throughout this movie is a huge turn off for me. The profanity. The black/white comparison ""jokes"". The poor/rich cliche nonsense. Etc. Actually if you ripped all of that out of this movie you would have what everyone in the US claims to be striving for . . . a movie without racism.

It is also well acted and full of humor. I am not an Eddie Murphy fan but I do like several of his movies. He seems to overact to show that he is good. This tends to make things non believable. He is not as good as his 48 hour movies but is very good here. His friend gets murdered in Detroit and he goes to Beverly Hills to get the killer and runs into a smuggling ring. Lots of action and I think great drama. Of course I like well made movies that make sense and to me this one makes sense and has great actors filling all spots.,1398902400,,710,3.972027972027972

I love the music in this film. It had a personal meaning for me. Much of the music was used in my aerobics class in the 1980's, so there are many memories. It is ""up"" and cheerful.

One may say, well there are so many warped professionals in law enforcement that warrant immediate discharge and therefore respect is not earned.  Many law enforcement agents will proudly say I went with my gut feeling and was able to foil the crime.  But, it was his derelection of duty that unveiled the perpertrators.  In the modern era ideology Eddie Murphy would be absconding to new territory. Today law enforcement official are reprimanded for minor infractions. If not dismissed from duty they are at least circumscribed.

Beverly hills cop is hillarious.  But at the same time it dramatically purports how hegemony can be  lethal when power is place in the wrong hands.  It also resonate how justice prevail and the wicked never win. As his indignation spiral he provocatively incite his rivals to revenge a true friendship.

Mr. Murphy stars as Axel Foley, a reckless Detroit detective who goes to Los Angeles to try and catch the people who murdered his childhood friend.  Mr. Murphy commands the screen and the film perfectly combines action and comedy stylings into one explosive hybrid genre.  The film was a monster at the box office and was the highest grossing R rated film for 25 years until The Hangover topped its mark.  The soundtrack was a big hit as well hitting number one on the Billboard charts and spawning three top ten singles (""The Heat Is On"", ""Neutron Dance"" and the ubiquitous instrumental ""Axel F"").  With some of the lousy movies Mr. Murphy makes these days, you should watch films like Beverly Hills Cop to remind you of how powerful and amazing an actor he can be.",1347235200,3,856,4.532467532467533

233245,4,6300213730,"""That the film turned out to be coherent is a miracle. That it is successful proves there is a God."" -Martin Brest on his own movie.

It's easy to understand his feelings when you consider the endless changes made to Danilo Bach and Daniel Petrie Jr's script. They got an Academy Award nomination, but the final product is a million miles away from what they originally conceived.

Axel Foley was originally written for Mickey Rourke, then it was geared around Sylvester Stallone, who significantly rewrote the script further before abandoning the project a couple of weeks before shooting was scheduled to begin. Eddie Murphy was brought on board at the last minute, and the script was re-written yet again to form the movie we know today. Bizarrely, all of the work Stallone did on the script was recycled into his reprehensible 1986 action movie Cobra, which, on top of being nothing at all like Beverly Hills Cop, called itself an adaptation of a novel called Fair Game by Paula Gosling (which it also bore little-to-no resemblance to). Nine years later, that novel was once again made into a movie of the same name starring William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford, which bore no resemblance to Cobra. When I say that Beverly Hills Cop had the biggest hodgepodge of a shooting script ever, you better believe it.

The story could not get any simpler. Young renegade Detroit cop Axel Foley, forever tormenting his no-nonsense boss with his reckless antics, meets up with a childhood pal only for him to be murdered that very night. Axel follows the trail and travels to Beverly Hills in his crappy, banged-up sky-blue Chevy Nova. It's a world away from the streets of Detroit. Even the patrol cops look like soap opera actors. Axel's fast and loose work ethic, barely on the good side of the law, doesn't sit well with the Beverly Hills police department. Detectives Taggart and Rosewood (John Ashton and Judge Reinhold doing a Laurel and Hardy routine) are assigned to keep an eye on Axel as he very quickly discovers the bad guy.

No twists, no surprises, and barely a couple layers deep, it's amazing that a story so superficial is able get 105 minutes of mileage. The film works thanks to Murphy's cheerful, upbeat performance and Martin Brest's ability to keep it light. Beverly Hills Cop would not have worked as a dark thriller. Harold Faltermeyer's iconic score and world-famous Axel F theme tune certainly help the happy-go-lucky nature.

There are certainly shortcomings. Steven Berkoff, as Victor Maitland, is completely unconvincing as the villain. In fact, with the exception of Bennett from Commando, he's probably the least threatening/most campiest villain I've ever seen in a movie. And, as I have mentioned, the story is very straightforward. Taggart and Rosewood do virtually no police work and are just bystanders watching and reacting to Axel's hustles. Apart from one cruise along Rodeo Drive, we never really see or feel the glamor of Beverly Hills to juxtapose it next to the grime of Detroit. There are just too many interior scenes.

But it never fails to entertain and is truly the highlight of Murphy's career. Once, long before he sold out to family audiences, his R-rated movies were huge business, and Beverly Hills Cop showcases his leading man ability at its very best.

The Blu Ray sports a fine 1.78:1 1080p picture with DTS HD-MA sound and a slight amount of old, recycled extras. Unfortunately, it also comes in a cheap, flimsy, easily broken eco-case.",1306281600,6,3487,4.9

Of course, I would easily rate this as a classic and one of the best comedies of all time, and if you want a really great balance of humor, drama, and action, then this is the flick for you.  But what I really want to stress -- and this is very timely due to the climate we are living in now -- is that what makes this movie great, in my opinion, is that the conflicts that you see within the plot don't have anything at all to do with race or the black vs. white issue.  Rather, everything you see that takes place has to do with the managerial and philosophical differences between the Beverly Hills and Detroit police departments.  Sergeant Taggart punches Axel (Eddie Murphy) in the stomach after he gets provoked, but does this cause an uproar or any kind of major controversy?  No -- it was cop vs. cop, and nothing more.  Suffice it to say, I can watch this movie again and again, and admittedly, since I already know all the punch lines, I don't exactly burst out in laughter anymore, but I still appreciate its immense depth, interesting story, and great acting and characters.",1299628800,,1236,4.422907488986784

233308,4,6300213730,"Detroit cop Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is in Beverly Hills for a few days to investigate the murder of an old acquaintance. Axel assumes the suspect is a local tycoon, but no one seems to believe him - including the police force, being semi-run by Ronny Cox (in one of his rare good-guy roles).

Axel comes into trouble with the law his first day on the job after getting thrown through a glass window by some thugs. He is arrested, and when released finds himself hounded by a pair of inept police officers around the town for a few days. After outsmarting them (in one of cinema's most delightful moments - ever) Axel gets hooked up with an old friend and manages to roam the streets looking for clues - which, of course, he finds very easily.

Before this film Eddie Murphy had starred in one film that had launched his name into Hollywood: ""48 HRS."" But by all reasonable comparisons this is a much, much better film, and it's also much, much funnier, too. What's most refreshing is that it doesn't fall back upon the stereotypes of African-Americans inherent in so many mainstream motion pictures - the role of Axel Foley was originally written for Sylvester Stallone (who was actually attached to star early on in pre-production before dropping out of the project) and it's quite clear that Foley was intended as a white character. Although massive rewrites were employed only two weeks before shooting, script flaws can still be spotted - the heroine of the story is a white businesswoman, for example, and we expect some sort of sexual tension between them but there is none. We begin to question the very presence of the female lead because in essence it leads nowhere. We can imagine how it might have developed into a love story, but Murphy works against the flow, awkwardly treating her as nothing more than a friend.

These sorts of things sometimes bring out the occasional odd touches in the film - ironically they unintentionally set the film apart from other such movies of the genre because it's not typical in any sense. Sure, it has the routine shoot-outs but there is no romance subplot, no pointless racial comparisons (more of which would be seen in the two sequels), etc. The movie greatly benefits from this because it seems so fresh, and far more believable - after all, rarely are romances developed in two days. The action genre always seems to end with the hero sending off the crooks to jail, and finally getting a long-awaited kiss from the leading lady. ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" to its credit, manages to avoid this and the result is a far more enjoyable film, even if most of its sequences are far from being 100% realistic.

The film's director, Martin Brest, has a clear handle on the buddy genre and would go on to direct the immensely successful Robert De Niro / Charles Grodin road-buddies-comedy ""Midnight Run,"" one of the most popular (and best) of the genre. Beverly Hills Cop works just as well - it's funny when it needs to be, thrilling when it wants to be, and features a stellar lead performance by Murphy in his most unusual role.

Murphy is the driving force behind the film, presenting us with a truly likable character - the most likable character he's ever played, as a matter of fact. Axel is unorthodox but a generally good guy - Murphy is sometimes typecast into playing roles similar to that of which he played in ""48 HRS."" (being the loud, obnoxious racist who's got it all together), but here he plays someone we actually want to root for. At one point in the film he manages to get a couple of police officers in trouble with their superior - but he takes all the blame, and actually fabricates a lie wherein they were heroes doing their job, despite the fact that they were all actually hanging out at a strip club. Axel is tough, cool, quick-witted, nice, sarcastic, and likable - one of cinema's most enduring characters, and proof that African-American cinema heroes don't always have to be loudmouths in order to succeed as characters (pay attention, Chris Rock and Chris Tucker).

The now-famous soundtrack (including 'Axel F' by Harold Faltermeyer) is a great blend of techno-pop and electronic rock - the movie's theme is bouncy, rambunctious and fun: a good parallel to Axel himself.

Overall ""Beverly Hills Cop"" exceeds exceptionally well, even if a great deal of the film's success itself derives from pure accident and chance. I don't think anyone can say that those involved in the production knew exactly what they were doing at the time (DVD supplements include anecdotes about hectic filming and the project almost falling through at one point) -- but as luck would have it everything turned out fine.

233312,5,6300213730,"Recently, I just browsed through my personal DVD movie collections & decided to watch the entire 'Beverly Hills Cop' movie trilogy, starring Eddie Murphy.

I had actually watched the original version in the movie theatres, with the first one during the eighties.

I had always thought that the first one offered wonderful life lessons.

In the movie, Alex Foley, a free-wheeling, street-wise, loud-mouthed police detective in Detroit (played by Eddie Murphy), while pursuing a murder investigation of a good but dead buddy, found himself dealing with a very different culture in Beverly Hills.

Meanwhile, he also got himself entangled with two reluctant but goofy cops (played like a 'Laurel & Hardy' duo by Judge Reinhold & John Ashton) from the Beverly Hills Police Department, while poking his nose into the affairs of a local businessman/art gallery owner, Victor Maitland (played menacingly by Steven Berkof), who also happened to be a drug kingpin using his gallery as a front.

On the whole, it was a hilariously funny movie with a gripping story, plus a now-famous sound-track with a great blend of techno pop & electro rock.

What impressed me most about the movie was not so much the pulsating action sequences & fascinating one-liner dialogue, but watching our quick-witted hero out-thinking & out-manoeuvring, irrespective of whether they were the bad guys or the good guys, who stood in the way of his murder investigation.

First, he conned the building renovation crew of a large house to take a few days off so that he could stay in it for free. Then, the 'banana in the tail pipe' episode was a real classic.

When he entered into a bonded warehouse illegally, he was cornered by a security guard, but quickly turned the difficult situation into a random inspection by US Customs to test their security protocol.

The 'Ramon' sequence (""Tell Victor that Ramon - the fella he met about a week ago? - tell him that Ramon went to the clinic today, and I found out that I have, um, herpes simplex 10, and I think Victor should go check himself out with his physician to make sure everything is fine before things start falling off on the man."") at the entrance to a posh restaurant to get to the drug kingpin was another classic one.

There were too numerous 'incidents' - worthwhile from the learning perspective - to write about here. Frankly speaking, you just got to go & watch this movie once again.

Whether you like it or not, the seemingly unorthodox methods by our hero, in reality, reflected quick spontaneous thinking on the feet. I like to call them acts of 'anticipatory prowess', a good life skill worth emulating in today's fast-changing world, especially when dealing with unexpected life situations.

Eddie Murphy is a very versatile actor. I have watched many of his movies, e.g. '48 Hours' & 'Another 48 Hours', & for me, this particular one has been most memorable, & best of all, offers the most real-life lessons.

Watching his funny antics in this wonderful movie is like watching the 'Law of Requisite Variety' at work!",1199664000,,3057,4.867052023121388

It stars Eddie Murphy as a Detroit cop named Axel Foley and is packed with action, comedy, a great soundtrack, and great scenes.  The opening credits to Glenn Foley's ""The Heat is On"" are filled with a montage of Detroit street scenes that give a great flavor of Detroit, which will be juxtaposed with the glamour of Beverly Hills later in the movie.

The movie starts with Axel Foley negotiating the price of a semi truck full of cigarettes with a couple of mobsters.  When they are surprised by a couple of uniformed Detroit cops in a squad car, one of the mobsters starts up the truck and takes off with Foley hanging on for dear life to a chain hanging from the top of the truck.  This is one of the classicly funniest chase scenes ever done and ranks up with anything in the Blues Brothers.

Later Foley returns home after being chatised by his boss, Inspector Todd, played brilliantly by a real Detroit Detective named Gilbert R. Hill, only to find his friend from California in his kitchen.  Later, when Foley's friend is murdered, he does the only thing a true friend would do, take vacation and head to California to track down the killers.

The rest of the movie is a look at how a gritty cop from Detroit gets along in glamorous Beverly Hills and more importantly how Beverly Hills gets along with a gritty Detroit cop.

Eddie Murphy is brilliant as Axel Foley poking fun at Beverly Hills, and Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are equally brilliant as Beverly Hills detectives assigned to watch Foley to keep him from creating havoc among Beverly Hills' elite.

But there was one film that came before all of those, and defined the cop movie comedy/drama forever. That film was ""Beverly Hills Cop"".

""Beverly Hills Cop"" was initially written in 1983 with Sylvester Stallone in mind for the part of Detroit cop turned Beverly Hills cop Axl Foley. But Stallone backed out of the project. Desparate for another lead actor, the producers turned to Eddie Murphy, star of the box office hits ""Trading Places"" and ""48 Hours"" and the most popular castmember on ""Saturday Night Live"" for a good two years. But the producers managed to lure Murphy away from ""SNL"" with a hefty salary. The rest as they say is history.

Detroit cop Axl Foley (Murphy) is one officer is known for what he calls ""f*&^ups"". When his latest f*&^up nearly costs him his job, he returns home to find his friend Mike has flew in from L.A. for a visit. After a night of partying, Axl and Mike return to Axl's apartment to find two criminals waiting for them. Axl is knocked out and Tony is killed over a business deal. Distraught over losing his friend, Axl takes a ""vacation"" Beverly Hills. Though he is told stay off the case Axl is determined to find who killed his friend. This leads him Victor Maitland (Steve Berkoff), a wealthy art dealers who may be dealing more than just pretty paintings. But when an interrogation with him goes awry, Axl is arrested by the Beverly Hills P.D. He is put under the watchful eyes of two cops (John Saxton, Judge Reinhold). But rather than doing their jobs, the two become friends with Axl and get him out of a huge pickle. But when Axl learsn of a drug ring operated by Maitland, he and the two cops are determined to thwart him and find Mike's killer. It's big thrills and even bigger laughs in this 1980s' comedy classic.

As for the dvd itself, tge sound and picture quality is excellent, and the bonus features are worth it. A dvd I would recommend picking up.",1124323200,,2066,4.533512064343164

233391,5,6300213730,"Starring in arguably his most memorable role, Eddie Murphy lights up the big screen with his 1980's blockbuster hit Beverly Hills Cop. Showcasing the unique comic talents of a young career on the rise, the former Saturday Night Live cast member's smiling humor and charismatic onscreen presence take an adequate screenplay and turn it into a smash film. Appearances by Paul Reiser and Bronson Pinchot (as the trendy 'Serge') combine with Murphy's antics to make Beverly Hills Cop a hilarious and highly entertaining movie...

Eddie Murphy plays the role of Axel Foley, a freewheeling Detroit police officer who witnesses the murder of a close friend on the force during a botched drug bust. Linking the murders back to Beverly Hills, Foley takes an extended vacation from his job in Detroit. But rather than relax, he makes his way to Beverly Hills where he plans on conducting his own investigation.

In pursuit of the murderers, Foley uncovers a massive drug smuggling operation run by one of the elite socialites of Beverly Hills. Digging for the truth, the Detroit cop is forced to butt heads with the Beverly Hills police department and confront the drug ring's various henchmen. Despite direct orders from their superior, Beverly Hills cops Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) eventually change from adversaries of Foley (attempting to halt his illegal investigations) to willing participants in his uncovering of the illegal drug ring. In the end, Foley finds the murderer, but will he get his revenge? Will the Beverly Hills police arrest him before he does? You'll have lots of fun finding out...

Complimented by a hit soundtrack which features four smash hits (Glenn Frey's ""The Heat Is On,"" The Pointer Sisters' ""Neutron Dance,"" Patti LaBelle's ""New Attitude,"" and Harold Faltermeyer's breakthrough hit ""Axel F""), the film's action and suspense sequences play out to the backdrop of adrenaline pumping beats and synthetic keyboard sounds. The music itself provides a small glimpse in the musical experimentation of an age that witnessed the convergence of high technology and sound. In a way, Beverly Hills Cop typifies the decade of the 1980s, but it does so without being so overly engrossed in the cultural fads of the day as to be outdated and ridiculous in the eyes of a modern audience. This is one of the core strengths of the film and one of the reasons millions of fans enjoy watching reruns of the movie on cable.

One of the more unique films of the 1980s, Beverly Hills Cop created a new sub-genre of film by splicing the serious action/suspense genre with the comedic personality/comedy genre. As a rare talent, Eddie Murphy is uniquely positioned to pull off the coup, carrying the film on the back of his personal likeability and hilarious brand of comedy. Performances by Judge Reinhold and John Ashton serve to compliment Murphy, and together, the three form a relatable, ""average guy"" click that audiences feel inclined to root for. As a result, the viewer is never bored, whether being entertained by mere suspense or hilarious comedy. Without a doubt, Beverly Hills Cop is one of the top ten comedies of its decade, and that's why it's a definite must-see movie...

233499,5,6300213730,"Beverly Hills Cop is an action comedy, and possibly the best in its genre. The movie stars Eddie Murphy (48 Hours), Judge Reinhold (Fast Times At Ridgemont High) and Ronny Cox (Deliverance), and is directed by Martin Brest who would later direct Al Pacino in his only Oscar winning performance in 1992's Scent Of A Woman.

Beverly Hills Cop is about a Detroit cop, Axel Foley, played by the foul and loud mouth Eddie Murphy, who's surprise visiting friend gets killed right outside his apartment door, and he sets out to Beverly Hills on vacation but secretly out to investigate the killing of his buddy which leads him to the discovery of a gang boss dealing with coffee and drugs. If you want to see Murphy in his funniest moments onscreen, then this is the movie. Cop is where Eddie's famous open mouthed laugh originated, as well as such classic scenes came from, Murphy dangling out of a speeding truck, getting thrown out a window, and pretending to be an inspection agent. But it's really the friendship he makes with the Beverly Hills cops assigned to watch him, the uptight Taggart (John Ashton) and the lightfooted Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), and the funny one-liners that make Beverly Hills Cop one of the funniest movies ever made, and a definite classic.

Along the way he runs afoul of the Beverly Hills Police department and clashes with a by the book culture that hinders his investigation. He must use his wits to maneuver through police bureaucracy and foil the villain.

A great supporting cast including Judge Reinhold and Ronny Cox assists Murphy. A great soundtrack featuring 80's classics by Glen Frey and the Pointer Sisters helps keep an upbeat tone in the film. Hot off his success on Saturday Night Live this movie was supposed to test the water for Murphy's ""bankability"" at the box office. And bankable it was. Costing under $10 million, the film made over $100 million back in 1984, establishing Murphy as a superstar.

Beverly Hills Cop is a funny and intelligent comedy that set the standard for many a film after it. (Rush Hour, Training Day, Lethal Weapon,) Over twenty years later the film is superior to all those that copied its formula for success. I recommend this film for anyone who likes action, comedy and a good time.

I also recommend this film for aspiring screenwriters. BHC is a great ""teaching"" film like ""Chinatown"" is.

Eddie Murphy has an infectious laugh, and his antics are hilarious.  In this story, an old friend, just out of prison, shows up in Chicago, where Detective Axel Foley (Murphy) is a member of the police force.  During their celebration of reunion, some thugs from California kill his friend, and so Foley takes off for Beverly Hills, against orders. to solve the crime.

This is a rollicking story, with truck chases, shootings, Murphy's dissimulations and antics--impersonating a customs agent, a Rolling Stone reporter, a flower shop delivery boy, and a light-in-the-loafers ""friend"" of the heavy, Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff).

This is a fun movie that you will probably enjoy.  It is rated ""R"" for language.  The violence is not to explicit, and I would think no worse than most B Westerns.

The bonus features are pretty good, You get the usual 5.1 surround, widescreen ect... I don't consider them a bonus... but you also get a lengthly extra from the cast members, most of the cast is on the interveiws! And its really interesting to find out about the stuff that what could have been the Beverly Hills Cop direction, when you discover it was originaly going to be casting Sly Stallone as the lead! Wonder what would have become of the movie with him as the lead? And also alot of other interesting things about the movie are on there that make it worth purchasing!
The audio commentary does give a few insightfull looks into the film! I had no idea Damon Wayans was in the film!!!! So it's actualy got some interesting things on the commentary!
The other stuff like location talk, or music talk, ect is kinda boring to me, but you might get a kick out of it? But overall, the only thing stopping me from giving this a perfect 5 is that they talked alot about how they had a few deleted scenes, and apparently a very, very large amount of out-takes where the cast and even crew couldn't contain there laughter and where rueining the takes because things where just too funny! And I was hoping to see them... so without Deleted scenes and Out-takes, i rate it just one star lower, it really should have had them... but maybe they don't exsist anymore? I don't know.
Overall, yes, it's a great price for a great movie, and well worth getting to replace your old VHS version!",1086825600,4,1587,4.475862068965517

That's why I ended up watching this. (Hey, it could have been Hard Rain) Before fame went to Eddie Murphy's head, this series of films shot him into the big time league. He's simplistically funny, without being too over the top, and he is so memorable, particularly in the scenes where he impersonates a homosexual and mocking a fellow black police officer's way of talking.
You know a film is either going to be either good or bad, when you recognise the themes and songs featured in it, without having seen the movie previously. I loved the theme song to start with, instantly recognising for some strange reason, but by the end of the movie, it's repeated so many times, you're sick of hearing it.
Nowadays, Eddie Murphy is over the top, doing kiddie movies (Daddy Day Care, Dr Dolittle, and the Shrek movies), when really, he seems more natural in this kind of role, or his role in Trading Places. In his more recent films, every joke is forced, and you practically hear Eddie thinking ""what am I saying?""
This movie is the best way to remember Eddie when he was good, and before he started playing the role, saying the same jokes, and generally trying to be the funny black man.",1086048000,3,1335,4.520661157024794

Cast:  Eddie Murphy, Lisa Eilbacher, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot.
Running Time:  105 minutes.
Rated R for violence and Eddie Murphy-like language.
While the television show ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""48 Hours"" solidified Eddie Murhpy as a star, the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer (""Armageddon"", ""The Rock"") production ""Beverly Hills Cop"" proclaimed that he was a blockbuster film goliath that was here to stay.  Using a hilarious script and some slapstick humor, the film became one of the most popular action-comedies to ever hit the big screen.
Murphy stars as the rogue Detroit city cop Axel Foley, who travels to Beverly Hills, California to investigate the mysterious murder of his best friend.  While staying the gorgeous environment, the Bevery Hills police department assigns two goofball officers (played by Reinhold and Ashton in fine roles) to watch after Foley and make sure that he does not create any problems.  With the help of an old friend (Eilbacher), Axel realizes that he is up against a rich and glamorous crook and the only way to get justice is to take matters into his own hands--no matter what Beverly Hills and the police department thinks about it.
Eddie Murphy is exceptionally funny in this feature, using many of his usual antics to get the clues that he needs and the things that he wants, but the shining star of the film is the quirky young detective Reinhold, looking up to Axel and doing what he knows is right, even if it is not normal police officer procedure.  Director Martin Brest (""Scent of a Woman"") and his explosive-friendly producers create an exciting, edge-of-your-seat romp that will have you giggling out loud the entire time.  The Special Collector's Edition has many nice added features, including a commentary from Martin Brest, information about the excellent award-winning soundtrack, and exclusive interviews from the cast.

Both picture and sound are very good and the widescreen effect does not interfere for those who aren't purists (I am and prefer widescreen editions).
Colors are very crisp and the sound is clear and more than adequate.
The film itself is enjoyable and, while the story is not the greatest, the cast including Murphy make it work with enough suspense to make it interesting to the end.  The suspense really comes more from the reaction to Axel Foley (Murphy's character) by the Beverly Hills force, especially the old chief than it does from the reason for his trip to Beverly Hills (Will he succeed in getting the BH force to support his actions?  will the Chief relent and let Foley finish his investigation?).
The action is pretty standard as a cop show.  However, Murphy's humor and reactions carry the movie and make it rise above the traditional cop genre.  Great supporting cast in Ronnie Cox, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton.  Foley's boss back in Detroit is great and deserves more screen time.

233589,5,6300213730,"After twenty years, ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is still one of the funniest films ever made, and a true milestone of 80's-style American filmmaking.  Eddie Murphy, director Martin Brest and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have in recent years set their careers on questionable courses (the first just isn't funny these days, while the latter two don't make good movies anymore).  But on this film, Bruckheimer (along with his late partner Don Simpson) and Brest blended a perfect marriage of inspired casting, witty screenplay and killer music to create a wonderous romp of relentless entertainment.  This was the movie that sent Murphy into the stratosphere of superstardom, and rightly so.  He has never been better or funnier than in this film's portrayal of ingenious, foul-mouthed Detroit detective Axel Foley, raising hell in Beverly Hills.  But equal praise must be given to the entire cast, particularly to Judge Reinhold and John Ashton as Murphy's unforgettable Laurel & Hardyesque comedic foils, and Bronson Pinchow as the hilarious Beverly Hills art dealer, Serge.  This film gets so many things right that it really hasn't aged, and its thoroughly 80's soundtrack serves it so well that the songs still sound fresh today.  The DVD features a few recent interviews with cast and crew members as they reminisce about the glory days of when they made the film.  Though their recent works may cast a nasty spell over us (be it Murphy's ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash,"" Bruckheimer's ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" or Brest's ""Gigli""), it's easy to want to forgive them after watching this joyous delight.",1079395200,,1591,5.115830115830116

Whether he's tearing apart the Harrow Club or shoving bananas into tail pipes, it's easy to see why Eddie became the number one box office draw in America during the mid-1980's.
Unfortunately, nobody at Paramount seems to have reasoned this impact.  The DVD release is dated and full of digital problems.  Colors are faded and weak.  So are the black levels.  Some scenes appear incredibly out of focus.  Loss of fine detail makes for a generally soft visual presentation.  Aliasing, shimmering, edge enhancement and pixelization run throughout the print.  Extras - some snippet that attempts to sum up the film in under thirty minutes and a trailer.  Part II of this film series fairs slightly better in overall visual quality but not by much.

233680,5,6300213730,"Remember when Jerry Bruckenheimer produced quality movies? Remember his partner Don Simpson? Remember Eddie Murphy back when he was fresh and funny? Remember the Axel F. theme? Remember when Martin Brest did comedies?
Everything you remember is here on this DVD! Don't bother with the sequels or ""trilogy"" box. This is the one that got started the formula of ""wise-cracking"" cops (apart from hysterical one-liners-through-squeeezed-teeth by Dirty Harry, who was well ahead of the times) genre that bolstered Die Hard and Lethal Weapon movies. It's a perfect example of ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy combined with ""buddy movie"" genre.
Plot in a sentence or two: resolved to find his best friends murderer, Detroit cop Axel Foley follows the trail to L.A. where his ""methods"" drive baddies and his Beverly Hills ""coleagues"" crazy.
Enhanced remastered SOUND is excellent, even better than what you saw at the theater all those years ago.
DVD itself: rather entertaining, although ""not-so-special"" features have mostly CAST & CREW INTERVIEWS, divided in 3 parts (INTERVIEWS, CASTING and MUSIC). It's fun to see how people  look and remiscent on those days about 15 years later. Also, there's DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY and THEATRICAL TRAILER. Pretty standard stuff, as I said.
Why they didn't include outttakes (they all talk how they ""burned"" a lot of film by laughing in the middle of shooting) or alternate scenes (there were a lot of improvisations on set, as they say) is beyond my comprehension.
Anyway... Buy this and you won't regret it! It's money well spent! You'll laugh yourself to tears, I guarantee it.

233681,5,6300213730,"Back before Beverly Hills Cop, you had films like Dirty Harry and In the Heat of the Night that showcased cops as a serious, sometimes tortured man hell bent on achieving their goal.  But with this film, we get a wisecracking, girl loving cop that wheels and deals and occassionally breaks the law to achieve his goal.  Before production began, Paramount wanted Sylvester Stallone to play the role of Axel Corretti (which he changed from Axel Foley and then changed back after his departure from the project), but his demands were big-budgeted and producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson passed him on.  They went to their first choice: Eddie Murphy.
Hot off the trails of Trading Spaces and 48 Hrs., here is where he achieved the height of his great acting and successful career.  He is downright hilarious here.  He makes Daniel Petrie, Jr.'s script ten times better than it already is.  The supporting cast is also brilliantly cast: Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Lisa Eilbacher, Steven Berkoff, Ronny Cox, and who can forget Bronson Pinchot as Serge, the gay art gallery worker that exchanges some of the funniest lines ever with Murphy?
The musical/song score by Harold Faltermeyer is one of the best in the composer's rather short career.  His ""Axel F"" theme is by far one of the catchiest songs ever in our pop culture.  It's a shame that his score for Beverly Hills Cop II didn't quite achieve this one's greatness and even sadder that he passed up Beverly Hills Cop III.
Martin Brest hit the jackpot in directing this feature.  Ironically, he originally declined to direct but eventually did due to Bruckheimer's insistence.  Brest is one of the best directors in Hollywood and it's a shame that he's not widely recognized as much as he should be (kinda like Matthew Robbins and Nicholas Meyer).  He knew how to combine action with sharp comedy, and here he does it with great flair.
With laughs and action that'll please anyone, this is the father of cop movies and one of the best films ever made (it is also the highest grossing Rated R film in history, so far).  Simply brilliant, this movie deserves a 5 star rating, HANDS DOWN.",1036368000,,2153,4.758064516129032

Detective Axel Foley (Murphy) goes to beverly hills to investigate the murder of his friend. He's not used to the politeness and clean tongue of the beverly hills force and
never does quite fit in. For example: He gets arrested once before they know he's a cop. Then at the police office: ""Why'd you guys believe them?"" ""We're more likely to listen to an important local business man than a foulmouthed jerk from out of town."" ""Foul-mouthed?! [profane word]you, man."" That basically sums up the sort of humor in this thing. Watch out for Damon Wayans as a guy who gives 3 bananas to Axel who then sticks them up a car's tailpipe.

The acting is first rate, the music even better and plot not altogether that far fetched. I won't belabour the storyline here as others have, but what I will say is that the quality of this DVD is superb considering the age of the film (18 years) as is the soundtrack presentation on home theatre systems. (5.1 Dolby Digital) Previous editions of this film on VHS and laserdisc were much too grainy and hardly worthy of purchase, however with this DVD Paramount has pulled out all the stops. Colour quality is excellent and one will find that even the song ""Axel F"" has a sort of additional beat to it on this disc thanks in large part to their new method of digital transfer bringing the soundtrack even closer to the ear.  I definitely recommend this DVD for your collection and Paramount is to be commended for an excellent effort worth every cent of your money.",1018396800,,1003,4.416216216216216
233775,2,6300213730,"It's not a good thing when, five minutes into a comedy, you start wondering what exactly should be laughed at. That seems to be the plague that befalls ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" which tailors jokes that are few and far between to a standard police chase plot that ends just how we know it will.
Eddie Murphy, in his justly acclaimed performance, plays Detroit police detective Axel Foley, who is well known in his precinct for his oddball methods of botching operations that end up costing the city thousands of dollars. When old pal Mikey Tandino (James Russo) shows up, the two go out for a night on the town; upon returning to Axel's apartment, two well-dressed thugs knock Axel unconscious and murder Mikey.
Like any good friend, Axel uses his vacation time as a cover for venturing to Beverly Hills, where he hopes to dig up information and clues leading to Mikey's killer. His discovery that Mikey worked for a major art dealer also leads him to uncover the dealer's dabblings in drug smuggling, though his findings are certainly not without trial and error, as he has countless run-ins with the Beverly Hills police force.
As you may well have already guessed, he befriends select members of the department, manages to infiltrate establishments whose security matches that of a daycare center, and ends up saving the day. How comically amusing, I said to myself once the credits rolled; I, in turn, was rolling my eyes.
Just what exactly was there to laugh at in the film, besides Eddie Murphy's abundant use of slang terms and profanities? I don't mind profanities as much as the next person, but when the movie's comedic relief revolves around the repetitive use of language, it tends to lose its ability to evoke laughter. There are some scenes that carry their weight, such as Axel's outburst in a hotel lobby, but the long stretches of almost little-to-no interest heavily outweigh these slight moments when the movie shows its potential.
Murphy, in perhaps his most beloved role, deserves his praise. As Axel, he almost (almost) carries the movie to success, throwing himself into the character without hesitation. Comedy is his stock in trade, and he does it so well, one wishes the writers would give him more room for improvisation.
In the end, ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is just another routine '80's comedy replete with a ludicrous police scenario and laughs that have lost their luster with the arrival of a new generation of comedy that includes such films as ""The Nutty Professor."" It's awash with predictability, which could be easily overlooked if there was something in the material, anything, that was worth laughing at.",1015027200,4,2633,4.89261744966443

He seeks revenge to the guys that killed his friend and goes to LA to investigate the turb issue.
Murphy's gesticulate and talking is superb and quite funny and Reinhold and Ashton parts are also brilliant as the good/bad cop.

Eddie Murphy plays Axel Foley, a fast-talking maverick cop from Detroit who goes to Beverly Hills on his own to investigate the murder of a friend. Never mind that the murder took place in Foley's Detroit apartment building and that Foley's boss has told him to stay out of the investigation. Axel's street-wise, inner city character has a field day in chic Beverly Hills. See what happens when he visits another old friend who works in an art gallery, when he invades the buffet brunch at the evil Victor Maitland's posh private club, when he orders food from room service in his hotel (don't ask how he's paying for the room) for the two cops outside who are supposed to be tailing him, or when he takes the same two cops to a strip joint in another jurisdiction. This flick has a lot of very funny moments, and there is a nice balance between the humor and some first-rate action sequences. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are great as the two local cops and the rest of the cast is solid. The music is also outstanding, and paces the story very well.
""Beverly Hils Cop"" is one of Murphy's best movies. It is also one of the best examples to date of the combination comedy/action movie. It's obviously not for kids, but a more mature audience should love it. Especially at this price. A great addition to most video libraries.",986342400,4,1514,4.569852941176471
233780,5,6300213730,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" is possibly one of Eddie Murphy's best and funniest films to date. Here, Murphy plays a congenial, not exactly by-the-book Detroit cop who decides to go to Beverly Hills for a little R & R. But, he gets involved in a homicide case against his boss's wishes. Along the way, he teams up with Beverly Hills Detective Taggart and his assistant Rosewood (the latter played by Judge Reinhold), and the recipe calls for suspense, intrigue and a little comedy along the way. The stunt where Murphy gets thrown through a glass window by Victor Maitland's (Steven Berkoff) gang of thugs is just fabulous, and the ""banana in the tailpipe"" thing is hilarious! Bronson Pinchot is also featured here in an early role as Serge, the gay art shop owner. Let's not forget the film's soundtrack, with songs by Patti Labelle, The Pointer Sisters and Glenn Frey, which is an ecellent companion to ""Beverly Hills Cop"".
