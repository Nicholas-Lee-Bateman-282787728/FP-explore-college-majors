3963598,3,B002P37M92,"For most readers interested in the work of Ernest Hemingway, the 1937 independent film THE SPANISH EARTH offers a small but intriguing window into the famous writer's world as a war correspondent during the late 1930s. Like most of the journalists based in Madrid and sympathetic to the Republican cause, Hemingway saw Franco's fascist rebellion as a prelude to what the Germans and Italians had in store for Europe in the coming years. Of considerable interest is Hemingway's own narration for the film -- even though Orson Welles was originally hired and is still credited -- and we can feel Papa's passion and respect for the freedom fighters and their valiant struggle for the land they love. In the end, we are witness to a bygone world where patriotic songs fill the air alongside simple military tactics and primitive armaments -- all in a vain attempt to preserve a Spain that would never be the same again.",1196121600,,915,4.834394904458598
3963599,3,B002P37M92,"I have always been interested in the Spanish Civil War.  I consider it a microcosm of the 20th Century based on its' involvement with the eventual fascist agressors of WWII as well as the most complete conglomeration of the century's vast array of European political factions.  It certainly seemed that, if there was a political movement in Europe, it was represented in the Spanish Civil War.  Nor was this a mere grab for power.  Both sides, full of reluctant alliances, threw everything they had (and everything they could import) into the fray.  The war ended with the Republicans out of money, ammunition and hope.  Spain never recovered yet they could take some solace in knowing that their exhaustion from civil war kept them out of WWII.

Over the years, I have read what books I could on the subject both in fiction and non-fiction.  There have been just a few movies made that involved the Spanish Civil War and most of them were movies made from popular works of fiction (such as ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Behold a Pale Horse"").  So when I saw ""The Spanish Earth"" listed on TCM's late night schedule recently, I had to take a look.

My initial reaction was that the voice that was supposed to be that of Orson Welles was definitely someone else's.  I guessed that it was Hemingway himself and was pleased to note above that I guessed right.  The script seems to be all Hemingway with its' simplicity that mixed in the occassional profound observation.  Naturally, the Hemingway influence made it clear which side the film was representing.  It tells of the efforts of a village to bring irrigation to their arid land to help grow crops to feed the people of Madrid; about 25 miles away.  The village scenes were nice but it was the focus on Madrid and the film of that city that made the picture worthwhile.  There were scenes of death and destruction as well as a view of the University City and the battles that raged around it.  There were scenes of some tanks in action and the tanks certainly looked archaic compared to the WWII models.  However, the story works its' way back to the village and the successful irrigation project.  What was left unsaid was whether or not Madrid had time to wait for crops to be planted, grown, harvested, and turned into bread and other food stuffs.  My guess was that the good citizens of Madrid would not taste the bread of victory from those fields.

Much of the movie is so juvenile that one suspects that Hemingway may have also been the uncredited director.  Of course, the propaganda was so thick that it was probably harder to cut than the bread that was supposed to save the day.  When I was a young man, I was clearly on the side of the Republicans.  Their's was the just cause.  They were defending their country and their duely elected government.  They were the side with the ragtag volunteers rather than the mechanized elite German and Italian forces.  However, time and research has enabled me to understand that, sincere idealism aside, their's was also the side that eventually fell under the domination of Stalin.  The downfall of Spain was involving foreigners in their affair.  It was hard to turn away the help but once they accepted it, they lost control of their own war.  Read the dedication that Cela wrote to his book ""San Camilo, 1936"" for the best Spanish perspective of that subject that I've ever come across.  Knowing all of this, I found it hard to cheer for the villagers.  I was more inclined to give them my pity instead.",1132963200,5,3512,4.623586429725363
8376571,5,B002P37M92,"Nice documentary from Joris Ivens about the struggles of the Spanish Republic who were trying to save their lives against forces led by Gen. Franco who was being backed by Nazi Germany. Ernest Hemingway narrates this documentary, which lasts just over 53-minutes. At that short of a running time you know not every aspect of this legendary battle is going to be talked about so if you're needing a history lesson then this here probably isn't going to be for you. We really don't learn too much about how this battle got started and of course there's no conclusion but THE Spanish EARTH remains rather interesting simply because of the images and the heart behind the storytelling. There's no question that the production company and director Ivens wanted to stand up against those they felt were doing evil things against human beings only wanting to put food on the table for their children. There are many striking visuals where we see people waiting in line for food, which of course runs out before everyone could be fed. We get images of the young men going off to war to fight and of course with war comes the images of many who lost their lives. The production is rather crude as the cinematography isn't all that impressive and there are many issues with the sound but this really doesn't take away from the film and in many ways it makes it even more raw. What I was most impressed with where the images that really put us in the middle of this battle and one of the most striking happens at a bread line where we see that even bread has been stamped so that the poor knows who it belongs to. Film buffs will notice that Orson Welles gets credited for ""narration"" but his vocals were dropped and replaced by Hemingway.",1524700800,,1728,4.559485530546624

It was Salvador Dalis Soft Construction in Boiled Beans  (Premonitions of Civil War) that I first viewed in my early teen years that remains the most graphic and terrible reminder of the way that a civil war can literally tear a country apart. Picassos Guernica is another famous painting that depicted the agonies of that horrible war.

Still there is nothing like the power of moving images to bring the meaning and reality of war home to the viewer. This film was made at the time of the war. It was clearly made to obtain the viewers support for the Republican cause  in short, a piece of propaganda, if you will, which did, however, encompass the essential truths of the war. The narrator is not, as the information displayed on Amazon states, Orson Wells, but rather Ernest Hemingway himself.

Naturally the film is in black and white, the operative (non)-colors of the era. This underscores the stark reality of village life in Spain. There is the good dry earth, that must be irrigated, and worked every day. The film features the village of Fuenteduena, with its 1500 souls, on the Madrid-Valencia road. The farmers sill plow behind horses, just like in the times of the Romans. Nine minutes into this film, of less than an hour, the fighting in nearby Madrid is shown, coupled with the straightforward assertion: Without Germany and Italy, the Spanish revolt would have ended six weeks after it began.

Even lugging those old cumbersome movie cameras, the cameramen got close to the action. Madrid is under siege, and the food shortages and the civilians being killed by shelling are depicted. The death also comes from airplanes. The wounded are also shown, which is now so often censored, so as not to impact the sensibilities of the viewer, and, of course, to protect the privacy rights of the wounded. Horse-drawn vehicles are often the norm in Madrid itself. The Republicans are shown at least holding their own, with the narrator stating that in one battle alone the Italians had lost more men than in the entire Ethiopian campaign. The political speeches of the Republican politicians are also shown.

Hope is essential in any propagandistic movie, so the successful efforts of the Republicans, in defending the Madrid-Valencia road against Fascist efforts to cut it, are shown. The denouement proclaims that the men fight on. Within 18 months or so, that road, and all else would be lost, and Spain would have to endure the rule of Franco, and the fascists, for more than three decades. This film is an important historical capture of the time, made available for free, to Prime members, bless Amazon for their efforts. 4-stars for the film.",1520985600,,3272,5.48015873015873
8376573,2,B002P37M92,"I was reading an article in the LOS ANGELES TIMES about a fund raising screening of SPANISH EARTH that occurred 80 years ago in July 1937. I had never heard of THE SPANISH EARTH, but the article was fascinating with famous actors and writers gathering for the screening. Supposedly, F. Scott Fitzgerald met his final muse Sheila Graham at a party the next night. There was talk of Fitzgerald and the ""ingrate"" Ernest Hemingway, who narrates THE SPANISH EARTH. Here was a film I had to see.

Sadly, this documentary of the Spanish Civil War is far from compelling. The background story is of a village digging a canal to bring water to irrigate their fields from a river 25 miles away. Interspersed are scenes of war and devastation as the village digs their canal. Narration is sparse though Ernest Hemingway does all or most of the narration. Interesting since I have never heard his voice.

A big problem here is not understanding what is going on. Which side are we on? They mention the Loyalists, The People's Army, The Rebels and more. Who is who? Are we supporting the government or the rebels? The feature several people and again, I had no idea whose side they were on.
Yes, this film is amateurish but these are the early days of ""realism"" as far as documentaries so I can understand flaws in the story and the filming.

In the end, I had no idea what was going on and I know the film was made to round up support for one of the sides in the Civil War. Some of the people were fighting for democracy so was Spain now a democracy and the king gone? Yes, I will read up on the Spanish Civil War and answer my questions but I was lost throughout the film. Madrid is in chaos and civilians are dying but what is going on??",1501459200,,1727,4.390625

8376579,3,B002P37M92,"When the winds of war began to roar in the mid 30s, several film makers began to address the growing threat from fascism. Pro French films like ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" (1935), ""Life of Emile Zola"" (1937), and ""Marie Antoinette"" (1938) appeared, and Hitchcock's Sabotage (1936) with Sylvia Sidney and Secret Agent (1936) with John Gielgud were even less subtle. But this film, produced in 1937, was the first film to formally address the threat.

FWIW - This was the first true pre war anti-Nazi film and would be followed by ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" (1939), ""Night Train to Munich"" (1940), ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940), ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1940), and ""The Great Dictator"" (1940).

""The Spanish Earth"" is a propaganda film cum documentary showing the struggle of the Spanish government against a rebellion led by Franco and supported by the Nazis. The film was produced and written by Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) and John Dos Passos (1896-1970) who also serve as narrators.

FWIW - Twenty year old Orson Welles (1915-85) also narrated, but his voice was not considered appropriate by producer Joris Ivens who replaced him with Hemingway whom he felt was more in touch with the film's POV.

Joris Ivens (1898-1989) was a documentary maker who made films in Russia (""Song of Heroes"") and the Netherlands (""Industrial Symphony""). Ivens originally intended to make a fictional film, but later decided to turn it into a documentary. He made no secret of his activist stand. He said - ""after informing and moving audiences, a militant documentary film should agitate-- mobilise them to become active in connection with the problems shown in the film.""

FWIW - Ivens was a committed Communist and the Communists were supporting the Republican government against Franco and the Nazis.

Ivens followed this film with ""The 400 Million"" (1939) about China, ""Our Russian Front"" (1942), ""Know Your Enemy: Japan"" (1945), and ""Indonesia Calling"" (1947). He won the French Oscar for ""Une Historie de Ballon"" (1976).

The Spanish Civil War has been covered in dozens of films including Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (1943), ""Confidential Agent"" (1945), Fred Zinnemann's ""Behold a Pale Horse"" (1964), ""The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca"" (1997), and  ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001).

This film is a priceless slice of history. We get to meet some of the principals in the conflict (Manual Azana, Jose Diaz, Commander Martinez de Aragon) and hear the voices of two of the 20th Century's greatest writers. But as a film it does not stand the test of time. The sound track is poor and most of the scenes are relatively uninspired. Much of the film consists of voice overs and there is very little contemporary dialogue.

It's difficult to evaluate a film like this. In its time it was obviously revolutionary, with live footage of a major military struggle. Hence, the film has great historical value. Viewed today it seems less than ordinary given how news coverage has changed in the intervening years. I gave it a 3 as a compromise rating. It's historic value is certainly worth a 5, but the film itself is hardly worth a 2.",1310083200,4,3116,4.9865125240847785
8376580,5,B002P37M92,"I have particular and personal interest in this film:
1.  Because it is the collaboration of some outstanding persons. . .Jorge Ivins; Virgil Thomson; Ernest Hemingway; Orson Welles; and, the Spanish People who fought valiantly against Franco, Hitler and Mussolini;
2.  Because my dad was in Spain fighting with the Lincoln Battalion at the same time the film was made (He was wounded at Brunete)
3.  And, to have a sense of the run-up to World War II. one must know about THIS period. . .

However, to buy it on Amazon for $19.95 is a RIP-OFF!!  I bought it last week on EBAY for $3.50. . .And, please don't give me that tired refrain of ""Buy American!""  The film offered on Amazon is made in China!  And, the default settings when you put it into your DVD player show Chinese sub-titles for the English-language narration by Orson Welles (This can be changed to NO sub-titles by a couple clicks of your remote)

I do, however, heartily recommend the film!!!",1265760000,8,959,4.6
