8187326,5,B000OYAT58,"Not sure what the other review is talking about, but this video is great.  I ""grew up on"" the VHS version of this, and it's great to see it available on DVD.  A soundtrack that has stuck with me through the decades, trust.  Tons of great live action, including broad daylight bombing footy of Kez5. YKK +more.  This might not hold up to modern videos as far as camera work goes, but it's definitely a piece of history in my eyes.",1375833600,,429,4.2592592592592595
