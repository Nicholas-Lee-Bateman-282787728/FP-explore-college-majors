1. Moon Struck --- The planet Venus is feeling left out because she doesn't have a moon.  The Zula patrol learns about how planets got their moons.

2. Me, Myself, and Io --- All about one of Jupiter's moons, Io.  Volcanic eruptions, colors, and orbit.

3. Blue Moon --- Learning about the attributes of Earth's Moon. (Not made of cheese, no man in the moon)
