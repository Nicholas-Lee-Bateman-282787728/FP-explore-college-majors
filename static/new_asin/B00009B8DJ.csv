7990587,5,B00009B8DJ,"Subaru takes off to battle Seishiro at the Bay Bridge. Their battle is intense, but neither truly wishes to kill the other. The battle is passionate and bloody. Will either man survive? Afterwards, Yuzuriha fights Satsuke, and in the process loses a dear friend. However, the cycle of rebirth is always present in our world, and someone is watching her back.

This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan.",1355184000,,746,4.609022556390977
7990588,5,B00009B8DJ,"The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.

To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.

Outline of the story:

The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.

The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.

The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.

As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.

Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?

The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.

The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).

As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.

The animation is excellent.

As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.

As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.

As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.

Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.

Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",1156118400,,4144,4.466225165562914
7990589,5,B00009B8DJ,"Alrighty then.  Deviations and out-of-order presentations aside...
Me being the Subaru/Seishiro whore that I am, I will eternally regard this as my favorite volume of X TV.  Their representation of their battle, while in my opinion was not NEARLY long enough, was still intense enough to grab my attention and keep it riveted.  *cripes, I've forgotten how to spell!*
The other episodes, after the travesty that was 'Slaughter,' failed to impress me though.  Yuzu-chan's episode was cutsey and Fuuma's utterly kick-ass, but I was still a bit too demolished emotionally to appreciate them.  Perhaps it's because I watched the last 2 minutes of 'Slaughter' so many times over that I was afraid my drive would start eating at my DVD in protest.
I clap merrily for the director for keeping the beauty of Subaru and Seishiro's scenes intact.  However, I'm still of the opinion that anime Sei-chan's fugly compared to his manga self, and definately a dog compared to his Tokyo Babylon representation.  And Subaru had his bad camera angle moments, too - just destroy the bish goodness, why don't'cha.
Wish they hadn't cut out the kiss in Sei-chan's side story, but guess you can't keep everything - especially with Clamp works and censors involved.
Just someone tell me - did anyone else get the distinct impression that the animators had stared at Tokyo Babylon Part One forever to be inspired for that heart-breaking photograph at the end?
I'm going to go watch 'Slaughter' again and cry now.  Gaw, I love it!",1066608000,3,1503,4.936507936507937
7990590,5,B00009B8DJ,"I'm getting to the point in watching anime where I'm not usually surprised by surprises.  After all, they are very much part of what anime is about.  But I let myself believe that I had the measure of this series.  Partially because the plot is a known quantity, based as it is on a very popular manga series.  In addition, the overall level has been so high that I didn't expect director Yoshiaki Kawajiri to notch up the intensity further until the final cataclysmic episodes.  Needless to say, I was wrong.
'Slaughter' is the first real battle clash between the dragons.  This has been a while in coming while the writers have developed the characters in fine detail.  Subaru fights first with Fuma and then with Seishoro, who once killed the woman he loved.  First blood is spilled in a grim story that reveals much about the forces of destiny driving the story line.
I expected the battles to continue from that point on, so my first surprise was to discover that the next episode, 'Wish,' was a deep dive into Kamui's doubt's and motivations.  A great reminder that he is not a simple player in a divine destiny but a human torn with anguish over the tragedies he has had to witness.  Now it is time to accept his role.
But the real surprise of this set is 'Newborn,' which is a pure tour-de-force.  This time it is Yuzuriha and Inuku who are the protagonists opposed first by the cold, questioning Satsuki and then by Fuma.  This is a sure formula for a tragedy yet, somehow, this episode zags just when you expect it to zig in a fashion almost impossible to explain.  The result is a triumphs is a triumph for both the actors, the writers, and the artists.
With three-fourths of this series over I've been musing at how much more compelling this version is than either the feature film or the manga.  In both of those cases the story frequently feels disjointed, particularly the film.  In this telling, even though the story line still jumps around, there is a sense of balance and flow that draws the viewer in deeper and deeper.  Perhaps this is because of the acting, or the director's knack for fleshing out the original's sketchiness, but it has complete changed my attitude toward the tale.
This isn't a beginner's anime series - it isn't light sci-fi or romance, but it touches some of anime's deepest themes.  It is bound to become the kind of classic that should be on everyone's must see list.",1060905600,2,2412,4.559164733178655
7990591,5,B00009B8DJ,"I have to agree with the other reviewer on here.....this is the best volume yet.  I found all the episodes riveting (even the second episode which is mostly a recap is interesting) , but it is the third episode that I loved most.  ""Newborn"" has a touching story and a wicked cameo by Fuma.  It also doesn't end the way you might think it will.  I find this series consistently excellent.  It's one of the best anime series in years and it's time that it gets the proper respect it deserves on Amazon.com.  It deserves all the high praise fans have heaped on it.  A beautifully animated, beautifully scored anime with compelling characters and a story doesn't come along all that often.
Long Live X TV !!!!!!",1059868800,,707,4.519685039370079
7990592,5,B00009B8DJ,"I found that a few of the first six DVDs (which will be eight total, the last two not yet released) included episodes that lacked story development and consisted mainly of flashbacks and lengthy dialogue, but the three episodes on X [six] were moving, exciting, and generally a big step towards the upcoming finale.  I almost cried over episode 16, the first of three on the disc, because of the well-written and beautifully animated encounter between Seishiro and Subaru, which involved thoughtful imagery and an unexpected but very moving revelation about the relationship between the two.  Episode 17 offers some more insight into the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth, winding down a bit from the action of 16, but a much needed break after the high levels of emotion in 16.  Episode 18 continued with more action-packed events, and also offered a closer look into the thoughts of Kusanagi, a rather unwilling Dragon of Earth.  Episode 18 ended in yet another emotional scene involving Yuzuriha and her dog Inuki.
Having waited some time for the release of this DVD, I am extremely satisfied and again impressed with CLAMP's skills.  Despite the enthralling cliffhanger ending of X [five], I was beginning to get discouraged with feelings that the series was not as well-paced as I originally thought, but after watching the three episodes of X [six], I can safely say that X continues to be my all-time favorite anime series.",1059696000,2,1439,4.929752066115703
7990593,5,B00009B8DJ,This is by far the best volume. The battle between Seishiro and Subaru were really awesome. They did a really good job explaining their story too. Yuzurihas battle with Satsuki was cool too. The volume is my favorite. Im sure the 7th Volume will be just as good.,1059523200,,262,4.479166666666667
7990594,4,B00009B8DJ,"I don't normally review items on Amazon, but I think the lack of reviews for X6 is ineXcusable.  Many anime fans have a film or series that really got them into it, and while I wouldn't consider myself an avid anime fan, X TV series has definitely gotten me hooked on anime.  It seems a lot of people are missing out on this truly special series.
Chances are, if you're checking out X6, you're already a fan.  If you are looking to see what X is all about and to start getting into the series, which I strongly encourage, check out X1.  For the fans, X6 is more of the same greatness we've come to expect.  The ""cliffhanger"" from episode 15 is resolved, as is the relationship between Subaru and Seishiro, in an emotionally satisfying and (for me) unexpected way.  Episode 17 is mostly filler, reviewing what has happened with Kamui thus far in the series but also advancing his character a little.  Episode 18 is difficult for me to rate.  I find it hard to take a 13 year old girl seriously, so any episode focusing on Yuzuriha is a challenge for me.  But some thoughtful dialogue, some insight into the character of Kusanagi, another truly evil performance from Fuma-Kamui, and a ""new birth"" (the title of the episode I think) all help make this a meaningful episode.
I love X, and I love this volume.  The only things keeping it at 4 stars instead of 5 are the fact that episode 17 was mostly a rehash of what has come before, my personal struggles taking Yuzuriha seriously (plus there were some hints of ephebophilia in there I found uncomfortable), and the lack of Sorata/Arashi story line (my personal favorite which I hope they take up in the next volume).  Any X fan following the series will not be disappointed with X6.",1059350400,,1731,4.498402555910543
7990595,5,B00009B8DJ,"This volume rocks. An intense battle between SUbaru and Seishiro kick off this volume. I love the fighting and the entire episode is amazing. It is without a doubt, my favorite. Yuzuriha makes plans to meet with Kusanagi but instead runs into Satsuki. Satsuki attacks her and her Spirit Dog Inuki. Satsuki asks Yuzuriha one question: ""Why is it wrong to kill humans?"". When Yuzuriha fails to answer, she attacks Inuki. Yuto then answers her question by saying ""Because there would be people who would be sad."" I love this volume, it surpasses X Volume 3, which I thought was the best before I saw this. Buy it. You won't regret it, but you will regret it if you dont!",1058313600,,667,4.566666666666666
