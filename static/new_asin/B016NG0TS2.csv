8736814,3,B016NG0TS2,"Andrew (Brandon Salkil) is in a coma and at home in a wheel chair. His sister Agnes (Joni Durian) starts to care for him. She realizes in an animated sequence Andrew is in her head. He instructs her to take the blood of dead women (which Agnes always kills while they are naked...sorry for that spoiler) so that he can get well and doesn't have to die. That is pretty much it. Small subplot. I liked the 60's monster models on the top shelf. Acting and effects nothing to write home about. One finger piano soundtrack made the film worse. Pretty much just sat around waiting for the next tattooed female to get naked. Not that it's a bad thing, just not plot worthy.

3 stars for the FF nudity (Joni Durian, Bambi Bodette, Circes Tate, Reagan Root, Corella Waring.",1474070400,2,764,4.457142857142857

Give these people a budget and let's see what they can do.",1453248000,,87,4.176470588235294
8736818,5,B016NG0TS2,"This movie is what film making is all about. Capturing a mood with a vision. The acting was top notch. The effects, props and visuals are all impressive. This is going to be one of those films that stands the test of time. This is a must see in a world of cookie cutter, mass produced, low budget garbage. Instead of being a fan of a ""film maker"" and liking any piece of trash they put out like blind sheep, be a fan of good movies instead. Make the creators step up their game and stop riding on their past successes. This movie will change your perspective of what can be accomplished with talent and creativity. I highly recommend. If you like horror and atmospheric films, then this is a must, not only to watch, but to add to your collection!",1451347200,2,747,4.304964539007092
8736819,5,B016NG0TS2,Those of you familiar with Dustin Mills work will love this film.  This is one of Dustin's best!!  It takes inspiration from 70's & 80's Italian horror films.  It it beautifully shot and very well acted.  Brandon Salkil gives an outstanding performance without any lines at all.  Joni Durian does a fantastic job in a supporting role as well.  I highly recommend seeing this film.,1444867200,2,380,4.769230769230769
