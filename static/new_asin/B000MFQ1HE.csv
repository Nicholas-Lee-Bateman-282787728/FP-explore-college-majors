8168417,2,B000MFQ1HE,"This documentary is way outdated. Its like going back in time and watching something from the 80s. If you want to understand gender dysphoria better, may I suggest Trans (2012) or I am Jazz Documentary (2011).",1525046400,,209,4.833333333333333
8168418,3,B000MFQ1HE,"This Documentary while it had some good momments, and there were only some. There were definitely many moments in which the information provided was not enough. The information provided is vague. Then you have some people whom express their disagreement of transgenders. Why the narrator is calling them transsexuals I don't know.  But There is hardly any explanation of anything except for when things get very technical regarding medical terminology.  Otherwise it continues on. This does a poor job of really looking deep into why we transgender people are. But on the other hand. I agree, yes we will go through the extremes just feel ordinary when all our lives we have felt we were born in the wrong body and anything but ordinary. And with people whom treat us unkind because they fail to understand, weather it be through ignorance, fear,or hatred, or whatever it maybe. The cycle of hatred on us continues. All we want is to be ordinary. To transition to the body that we inherently feel and know we belong to. I also agree that yes now a days they have gotten to relaxed with the guidelines/rules of what it takes to get approved for gender reassignment surgery, and getting approved for testosterone. I know that its a double edged sword. But i say this because we have alot of kids whom identify as transgender. I identified as one as a child. But i still spent yrs, decades still thoroughly thinking about it. Talking about it, with professionals before making such a huge descion. I never took this lightly.  I was completely aware of how serious this life changing event would be. And while I can empathize, and sympathize with kids whom are really struggling because they want to start hormone therapy asap. These so called guidelines have become so relaxed that theres this dilemma of the proffessionals asking themselves that question of whom is a genuine transgender and whom is just going through a phase. This Documentary was far too short. Because this issue is very complex. I have spent decades researching what makes a person gay,lesbian,bisexual,transgender (transexual) and the deeper we go. The more we are realizing in research, that its a combination of geneitics,and environmental. The old fashioned nature/nurture. But its not as simple as people want it to be. Its never going to be. Becuase each person born is the product of their genetics, and genetic disposition, as well as their environment. But not always. Nothing is truly black and white. If you have ever experienced any form of hatred, any form of bullying, abuse. And you can still remember what it felt like. Imagine that life on a constant bases for transgender people of all ages from all over the world. The highest suicide ratings is from transgender people.",1504656000,,2758,4.888888888888889
8168419,4,B000MFQ1HE,"Fast moving, hopeful and involving documentary about transgenders born female but transitioning to male. And some of them turn into really hot men! (Ryan and Scott, for example.) I particularly liked that one (Rachel/Ryan) was an identical twin and that information about twin studies was mentioned. I am not a transgender person but I do wonder what it is like to be one. And that one hospital that did a double mastectomy for just $7000? What a bargain! Wonder what that hospital would charge now.",1501804800,,499,4.882352941176471
8168420,1,B000MFQ1HE,"This is a severely outdated documentary that does not handle it's subject properly.  It's constant switch of being skeptical yet supportive of its subject is horrendous.  Constant misgendering, failure to use proper pronouns or names, ect.  Also the title suggests they are transitioning from male to female when indeed it is the other way around.  Parents of transgender children look for information to grasp an understanding of their sons, daughters, or non-binary children.  This will only confuse the issue and engrain worse situations.  As an advocate, ally, and member of the LGBT community it is my advice that NO ONE watch this media unless you understand and are looking for an example at what not to do in a documentary.",1484438400,6,731,5.05
8168421,1,B000MFQ1HE,"This is a horrible, HORRIBLE documentary. They continue to call these transwomen men throughout the documentary. They also have HORRIBLE doctors that suggest transgender individuals can be somehow ""change"" back to feeling like the gender they were assigned at birth. Ugh.",1479254400,,271,5.634146341463414
8168422,2,B000MFQ1HE,"...makes me angry. Four women who become men? Maybe someone needs to do their research. These are male-identified people. Even if they haven't physically transitioned yet, they are men if they identify as such. Man, I could go on forever, but I don't think anyone would get it! When does it start using ""he"" instead of ""she""? When they have surgery, or go on hormones? Where's the line? These transmen are men as soon as they say they are, regardless of physical status.",1208649600,6,470,4.674698795180723
8168423,5,B000MFQ1HE,Nobody can do documentaries quite like the Discovery Channel. Follow four women as they make the process of becoming men. The film lets you dive deep into the pyche of these individuals as well as their struggles from within and from the outside world. A very interesting film in an interesting time in our history. No matter where you stand on the issue you will certainly be informed after this documentary.,1170201600,5,409,4.774647887323944
