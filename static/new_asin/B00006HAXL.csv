7968993,5,B00006HAXL,"I purchased this as a gift for my father and he absolutely loved it!  He loves nature and traveling DVDs, but I often have trouble finding ones he does not already own or seen.  However, this one he hadn't seen and he was excited to receive this.  My sisters bought him the other DVDs that go with this one.  What a perfect gift!  The item shipped very quickly too.",1291334400,3,365,4.231884057971015

7968995,5,B00006HAXL,"Globe Trekker is always consistant in their quality coverage of whatever area they land in and ""Northern Australia"" is no exception. Ian Wright explores the ""outback"" which is one of the most sparse and rugged landscapes on earth. Megan takes us to Queensland home of the oldest rainforest on the planet. They take us camping on the biggest sand island in the world and then, diving amongst the Great Barrier Reef`s. Who could ask for more? It`s great! Globe trekker rocks!",1148688000,3,473,4.851851851851852
