7429397,5,B0157753X4,"Wow. My friend Greg Machete got this at red box and brought it over with the hopes of scaring me. It worked!  No wonder it was a huge box office hit. The cinematic experience on my home projector screen was flawless. The drastically different audio levels from scene to scene kept me on my toes with my volume control.  The dramatic use of bad video/color editing kept me on the edge of my seat with my contrast control. The plot was genius, but I won't ruin this gem of a movie for you. I know one of the crew members and they told me that the budget for the film was $400, a $30 Staples gift certificate, 3 boxes of pizza, and a box of room temperature Lunchables. They worked very efficiently to create a movie of this quality on that budget. Their dedication to efficiency and not spending money on editing can be seen when the 2 younger characters are sitting on some outside steps and as the camera pans out, some filming equipment bags can be seen at the lower left corner of the screen. Bravo. Can't wait for Ouija Exorcism 2: The Career Ender, to come out.",1452988800,8,1065,4.32
7429398,1,B0157753X4,Worst movie I've ever seen. Graphics were terribles. Expected way more out of this,1452038400,,82,4.928571428571429
7429399,1,B0157753X4,"I am a big fan of horror movies, but this was just a waste of time.  I won't even bother posting spoiler warnings because this movie is so bad that spoiling it will save you 90 minutes of your life.  The story is boring, the characters are dull and uninteresting, and the special effects are about as special as the BBQ grill you have in your backyard, i.e., not special at all.

When people are possessed by this ""demon,"" they just have clouded contact lenses in their eyes and their voice is run through a computer to make it sound scarier.  I've heard scarier voices coming out of plastic dolls at Halloween time from Spencer's Gifts.  And of course since it's a crappy horror movie, we have to have the obligatory topless woman in it and the sex scene, but even those things are boring.

The best thing about this movie would have to be the cover and the DVD title screen.  I'm serious, it'd be more entertaining to just look at the DVD title screen with your TV on mute than watch the movie.  So, my recommendation for this movie, just look at the DVD cover art here on the Amazon page for a few seconds and then go watch something else.",1451260800,,1142,4.328638497652582
7429400,1,B0157753X4,Literally the worst movie I've ever seen in entire life. This movie makes sharknado look like a five star film. I'm upset I wasted a $1.50 at redbox for this crap.,1449619200,5,163,4.290322580645161
7429401,4,B0157753X4,"While this movie was primarily not that scary, it did have its moments. In my opinion there needed to be more build-up of the characters when they were young so the audience is aware of the early relationship between them.  This might have given more credibility to the relationship between Joe (Ben Morrison) and Bev (Laura Kirchner).  After viewing this film I searched for more movies in which Laura Kirchner has starred as I felt she had a great film presence.  I was surprised to find that this was one of her first performances.  Hoping to see her in something else soon.",1447977600,,577,4.627450980392157
7429402,1,B0157753X4,"If I could give this movie less stars I would, I get scared easily but this is about as scary as watching paint dry",1446336000,,115,3.8333333333333335
7429403,1,B0157753X4,"This movie is the dumbest movie I've even seen in my life , such a waste of time . All the editing sucked and the characters had horrible acting . ",1446336000,,147,3.9
7429404,4,B0157753X4,"Considering it was shot in the San Fernando valley it has a bit of a ""porn"" feel and a couple of brief nude shots with tatted actors drives that point home (pun intended). But it was shot well and the lead actress who played the adult Bev rose well above the rest of the cast and has a future in mainstream cinema. Solid Halloween camp entertainment for sure!",1446336000,,359,4.294117647058823
7429405,2,B0157753X4,"Joe (Ben Morrison) visits his dying father (J. Damian Anastasio) who had placed him in foster care over a Ouija board incident when they were children. He meets his childhood neighbor Bev (Laura Kirchner -SJP lite). Together the two families go off to a retreat. For nearly an hour we get character and plot build up. Joe's slightly socially inept son Noah (Michael Palladino) has the hots for Bev's daughter Chloe (Brittney Bertier) and she is ""creeped out"" by him. Things plod along, thank you Lola Kelly for letting us see your boobs, until 15 minutes from the end when the film climaxes and I try to suddenly feign interest.

In one scene when Bev and Joe are talking I noted the background sound had a distinct change. The early childhood scene would have taken place in the 1980's although it looked more 70's. The kids were neat and I wish the story would have centered around them. Ben Morrison had a terrible dead pan character with greasy hair and unshaven. I am not sure what the woman straddling the Ouija board has to do with the film.

Julia Rae was adorable as young Bev and I wish her well on her career.",1445644800,2,1120,4.512315270935961
7429406,2,B0157753X4,"Ouija Exorcism is about what you'd expect for a straight-to-DVD horror flick. I tried to give the movie a chance, as you can sometimes find hidden gems among low-budget horror movies, but it disappoints.

The good: The cinematography has its moments, there are a couple lines of funny dialogue, and the story just barely scratches the surface of Jewish exorcisms (something rare in horror movies).

The bad: The audio levels change way too much. You find yourself turning up the volume just to hear what's being spoken, only for it to be too loud the following scene. The lighting effects aren't consistent. The movie contains too much filler of weak dialogue and subplots involving relationships. The acting isn't anything special. The special effects and ""demon"" voice sound effects are lame. And aside from a one or two ""boo"" moments meant to startle the viewer, the movie just isn't that scary.

If you're a diehard fan of movies related to demonic possession, it might be worth watching. If you're a casual fan of horror movies, do yourself a favor and pass on this one.",1445385600,2,1075,4.863387978142076
