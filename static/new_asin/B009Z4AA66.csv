8545541,5,B009Z4AA66,"I have never made a list of my favorite movies but if I did, this would be right up there.  I am so sorry that Tom Hulce hardly acts any more though he's done very well for himself as a Broadway producer.  This is such touching story where he plays a mentally challenged garbageman who puts his brother through school.  I saw this movie when it first came out and it has stayed with me for years.  I bought it mostly so I can share it with others.",1399852800,,447,4.045454545454546
8545542,5,B009Z4AA66,"Dominick and Eugene.  Featuring a very young Ray Liotta, this is a great movie showcasing the loyalty two brothers have for each other.  There is a nice twist at the end which explains why one brother has taken such good care of the other--very heart warming.",1396656000,,259,4.608695652173913
8545543,4,B009Z4AA66,"Dominick & Eugene is a wonderful story with great acting.  This movie is the main reason I purchased this item. I thought that it was really awesome to get Fight for Life with it as I love Jerry Lewis & Patty Duke. Fight for Life is great story & Patty Duke's performance was wonderful. Unfortunately Jerry Lewis' performance was awful & detracted from the story. His performance was forced and mechanical.
  Still well worth the purchase price for Dominick & Eugene.",1392076800,,467,4.7407407407407405
