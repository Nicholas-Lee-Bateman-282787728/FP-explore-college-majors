8336948,5,B001R0AYAS,"This collection contains all 30 public domain episodes of THE LUCY SHOW, as well as 6 episodes of SUSIE starring Ann Sothern and 4 episodes of I MARRIED JOAN starring Joan Davis. Rewatching these LUCY episodes, they are better than I remembered them. The print quality, for public domain episodes is better than on other, similar sets. SUSIE, aka PRIVATE SECRETARY is a funny and seldom seen comedy from the 1950s as is I MARRIED JOAN. Both series have their share of laughs. In all, there is quite a lot of classic entertainment here for the money.",1456099200,,549,4.670103092783505
8336949,3,B001R0AYAS,"I was a little disappointed when I discovered this cd collection also featured 10 episodes starring Ann Sothern and Joan Davis. They were before my time and needless to say, I'm just not interested in watching them.",1318291200,,215,4.837837837837838
8336950,1,B001R0AYAS,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show.""  You're throwing away your money.  The audio and video quality isn't very good.  Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show.""  We already have seasons one through three out.  Season four should be out sometime in March 2011.  You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases.  It's like they were filmed a month ago.  In addition you get great bonus features.  So stop buying the same 30 episodes.  I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291420800,3,625,4.811320754716981
8336951,5,B001R0AYAS,I own and love this collection. I did not buy it through Amazon. I wished I had because the price is a lot more reasonable then what I had paid for it. I had to buy it in more then one set and it cost me more as well. Great price and great entertainment for anyone who loves Lucille Ball. I have never had any trouble with getting refunded for merchandise if anything was wrong with it. Now and again it will happen but if you buy through Amazon you can be confident that you will be done fairly on your orders. This collection is worth having so hop on it while the getting is good. My favorite episode in this collection is where Lucille Ball & Vivian Vance try to install a shower after Lucy makes the plumber mad enough to quit. They get caught in the shower because of Viv's failure to put the door on right. Then they mess with the water knobs which; creates an even bigger problem.  Great laughs and great fun!,1266969600,,917,4.1807909604519775
