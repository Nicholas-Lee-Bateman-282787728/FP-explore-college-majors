7801482,5,193136303X,"Vladimir Vasiliev is a very experienced fighter and teacher and this collection of videos is a nice introduction to the Russian Martial Art. The techniques are based upon relaxed and natural movements, and thus the techniques are not really techniques at all, but simple responses based upon the individual's capabilities.

You will notice below that there is a review that says that the tapes are silly and goofy, with no substance. I would suggest that you serach the web for video clips of Systema or Russian Martial Art and decide for yourself. I know of no one who has trained with Vladimir or his top students and left unimpressed. The style is proven in spetsnaz combat and also has as its basis the development of a good spirit and better humanity that causes as little harm as possible to the attackers.

Vladmir Vasiliev teaches in the Toronto area and is one of the most genuine people you could meet. He is a veteran of many special ops missions and an experienced teacher, training Russia's elite operatives for ten years.

You may find the movements strange, but the proof is in the pudding. Many many more dvds and videos are available as well.",1104192000,4,1159,4.727722772277228
