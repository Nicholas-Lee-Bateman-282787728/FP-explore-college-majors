6495154,5,B00LOCLBVU,"This movie combines a pleasant storyline with great acting chemistry.  The story is easy to predict but the actors portray with compassion and interest, so you are never disappointed as you watch it come to conclusion. There is just enough reality to make the situation realistic. It also incorporates some ""vintage"" charm as part of the storyline.  Worth watching again and again. Did you know that the lead actress also was in Backyard Wedding and here's another piece of trivia, she also was in Mr. Holland's Opus.",1413158400,3,517,4.931034482758621

6495187,5,B00LOCLBVU,"Alicia Witt stars as Alice Chapman - an antique shop owner: the shop passed down to her from her father along with her love of antiques. She is dating an up and coming property developer who is working for a company anxious to get ahold of the land that just so happens to have Witt's store as a part of - and she is a definite 'No Sale'. What is a manipulative boyfriend to do but to have her convinced of his devotion to her, his doting upscale life spread all about hers and with the next step, he would like her to meet his parents...finally. She feels the two are in-sync and the perfect match although as the story progresses, we soon see she has put her whole life's dreams on hold for another.

In a mixed-up meeting at the airport, unaccompanied by her fiance, she meets someone she believes is related to him directly by name and goes home with him. Believing she is meeting the whole wonderful family as expected. She is overjoyed with the likenesses they share and the new relationships she makes, one in particular. As the title implies, this is a mix-up on several accounts that she hasn't a clue of while having the Christmas time of her life... until reality sets in.

This movie actually teaches a great lesson about putting aside your own values, traditions, and ideas for another while not even realizing the compromises you have slowly made. Is she able to catch this in time or can her fiance, who is a master manipulator, overplease her with everything that he can offer? This film spans home cooking to homewrecking and everything tossed into a great Christmas eye-candy Hallmark Movie.",1522713600,2,1609,4.56401384083045

6495237,4,B00LOCLBVU,Movie is great but the video presentation.  Ouch.  Heavy Interpolation is a major distraction.  Common in OLD dvd's.  Not so much in todays dvd's like 2004 on up.  So not sure what the slip up was on that :(  Lines on pause  lines on tv (1080p upconverted.  )  even 2002's Ernest Saves Christmas doesn't come in this distracting method.  probably why it's worth $3 now .  Hope they release a better presentation,1513987200,2,411,4.569444444444445

The two  leads have wonderful chemistry and it just cheers you up.  Usually, the intent of any of these Hallmark programs is to sugar up reality and take us out of it for the two hours.  Some are better than others and I've enjoyed this one a great deal so it definitely falls into the ""better"" column for me.",1513728000,,434,4.308641975308642

6495270,5,B00LOCLBVU,Very sweet romantic comedy. Of course it is formulaic like most genres of film but it is perfect to watch for light pleasant entertainment.

She falls for him and he for her. Her fiancee finds her and takes her to his parents house for Christmas. It does not go well. (Happy Ending Though),1510185600,,457,4.3882352941176475

6495337,1,B00LOCLBVU,"The overall story was cute-ish. I didn't really have an issue with the actors either.  The problem with this film was the script.  The story was never going to be amazing, but there was simply too many places where the dialogue was stilted and simply didn't sound the way real people speak.  There were scenes where the actions of the characters were too childish for the age the characters were supposed to be.

I get that this is a Hallmark Holiday movie, but it's definitely story-lite.  There's a not a lot of story to the story.  What little plot there was seemed to be vaguely reminiscent of ""While You Were Sleeping"".  Although there's no comatose brother, there's misunderstanding of a family who thinks the main character is engaged to a son who apparently doesn't have a great deal of contact with his sibling (and this doesn't work very well, as it was odd that no one in the family thought to call ""Billy"" to find out what was going on).  One brother is a businessman, while the other is someone who builds furniture. Instead of the semi-cantankerous next door neighbor, there's a grandfather.  The problem is there's not enough of a story to tell here.  I can almost picture pages of the script with minimal dialogue and stage directions that say ""Act playful and cute"" (hence the ""making cookies"" scene).  Even with a better script, this still would not have been Citizen Kane, but it would have given the actors something better to work with.  There were a few places that were so saccharine as to be embarrassing.",1489795200,,1529,4.664179104477612

6495459,5,B00LOCLBVU,"For the first time in my life, at the age of 76, I immersed myself in Hallmark Christmas movies.  I was surprised how much they visually resemble each other, the creative use of well-known and not well-known actors, and the really lush use of locations, set decoration and large casts.  And I was surprised at how uniformly they are enjoyable, wholesome and fun.  This is one of the best, with a truly original premise, actors who clearly are enjoying doing the story and lots of sweet moments along the way.  I am buying the DVD.",1483315200,,530,4.5473684210526315

I realise it might seem like I'm just being negative, but I was actually really excited by the description, and thought the concept had promise... That said, it was actually painful to watch Alicia Witt at certain points... I actually think, despite being a pseudo famous actress, she was the MAIN downfall of this whole film. It was like watching a child tell a lie. They're absolutely crap at it, but they are committed to the lie. Ugh.",1478131200,,547,4.649484536082475

This, however, did not happen. I truly enjoy Christmas movies and was not disappointed with the surprise twist in A Very Merry Mix-Up. In fact, the shocker made me shoot Mt. Dew out my nose. Though the plot was redeemed, I could not give this a full raster of stars, because it did lag in places. The characters were likeable and had enough depth for the story.

The story revolves around a woman who through a mix-up goes home from the airport with the wrong family who just happens to have the same surname as her fianc.  It was a good movie, had I seen it on Netfliks, I probably wouldn't have bought it for my library, but I probably will watch it again a few more times.

6496111,4,B00LOCLBVU,"Ridiculous and I still liked it.  It's based on one of those coincidences that a regular publisher would probably reject.  A young woman ends up at the wrong house and family, thinking it's her prospective in-laws.  They're a perfect match.  When the mix-up is discovered, it takes her a while to realize that her fianc and his family are about something alien to her.  The fianc at first seems in danger of being a total jerk in the film, but it turns out he's not a bad sort after all, just not right for her.  Fortunately, there's a guy from the other family who is, and he feels the same way.  Don't you love happy endings?  Merry Christmas!",1451692800,,645,4.406779661016949

HAVING FUN. Her future brother in law and her also form a close bond.  When they realize the mix up she is terribly embarrassed, heartbroken and the family is sad she won't really be their daughter in law.

Her real fiance is self centered, and condescending and when she meets his real family they are cold and weird. Which makes her realize that marrying him would be a big mistake, she misses the other family she thought was to be her in laws.

6496263,1,B00LOCLBVU,"Coming off a five-day Thanksgiving Vacation, I was ambushed by my wife and daughters into watching rotten Hallmark Christmas movies. This was one of them. The dingbat redhead is a terrible actress and the plot is unbelievably weak. So, in an effort to give you more time to spend with your families, and waste less time watching these rotten ""chick flicks"", I will give you the plot of every single movie in just one brief post:

Single woman, usually a mother of a small (and troubled or sick) child, finds herself heading into the Christmas Season without a boyfriend, and usually struggling to make ends meet.  Soon she meets her prince and things look good for the relationship until either (A) a rival of the woman does something,  (B) the disapproving parents of the boyfriend interfere, or (C) a simple misunderstanding breaks up the relationship, and (wouldnt you know it) right before Christmas. The new boyfriend is either (A) tremendously wealthy, (B) poor but cute and wise, or (C) royalty.

Then, a Christmas Miracle occurs to repair the relationship just in time for Christmas, and everyone goes on to live happily ever after. The (town/child in need of operation/struggling business of the woman) is saved!

Finally, if you're a male watching this sissy stuff, turn in your ""man card"" - you'd have to be a total wuss to like this!",1448841600,,1345,4.8304347826086955
6496264,5,B00LOCLBVU,"One of my favorites. Cute, fun, and even believeable despite all the hang ups that happen. Very warm and touching as well. Great Christmas movie!",1448755200,,145,4.84
6496265,5,B00LOCLBVU,Love all the Hallmark Christmas movies.  They are great family movies that can be enjoyed over and over.,1448668800,,104,4.777777777777778
6496266,5,B00LOCLBVU,"I love Christmas movies, but this is on my list of top 10 favorites. I don't know if it's the story itself or the chemistry between the two actors that make it what it is, and that is a simple sweet old fashioned kind of love story.
Now, there is the classic jerk, the odd ball in-laws to be, and the quirkiness that make the equation of this movie, but each of those elements add to the sweetness of the main characters and their story.",1448582400,,437,4.152941176470589
6496267,2,B00LOCLBVU,"I am mystified by the high rating for this incredibly mediocre movie.  Alicia Witt carries the movie as well as an one actor possibly could, but that is all it has going for it.  There is NO chemistry between any of the characters and the story is unrealistic even for a Christmas movie.

Matt is just strange and awkward in every way.  There is nothing in the story to suggest why Alice would be attracted to him.  Though Matt's family is clearly warm and welcoming to Alice, there is no character development.  I have no idea who they are or what makes them tick.  They are bland.

There are many parallels between this story and ""While You Were Sleeping"" but a world of difference in the way that it is presented.  This movie fails on so many levels that it is hard to know where to start.

The characters tell us what they care about but there is no real evidence in their actions.  The dialog is trite and silly in many ways.  The photography leaves a lot to be desired.  The scenes are incomplete.  The place with the ice sculptures is a mystery to me.  Where is it relative to the town?  Why is Matt the only person there?  What does the area actually look like  we only see a glimpse of it.  What happened to the car that crashed?  Why would anyone turn down $3.5 Million just for sentimental reasons when they are struggling to survive?",1448496000,2,1345,4.346774193548387

6496269,3,B00LOCLBVU,I bought this movie having never seen it to add to my hallmark Christmas collection. I don't have cable and enjoy buying a new movie every year. The price was reasonable $5 and it had so many great reviews. The movie had some cute parts but I thought it lacked the usual hallmark charm. I wish I had read the 1 or 2 star reviews before purchasing. I won't make that mistake again.,1447977600,,380,4.219178082191781

She is an amazing talent ~ both in acting and music ~ and he is a ruggedly handsome guy.  We need to see more of this combination.  Amazon delivered my movie in just 2 days ~ and since receiving it I have played and replayed it.  It was totally fun hating Will's mother, Judith, although I loved her turquoise jewelry.  She really nailed her role.  I agree that the music was a bit loud, and I would have appreciated having the dialogue written across the screen, but all in all, I loved the whole movie.",1447113600,,630,4.243697478991597

also.  There were some complaints uttered ""what did she say??)
One problem that so many films have today (even Halmark) is the way actors simply do NOT speak clearly.  They often mumble or even turn away when talking and the mike just does not catch what they say.  They need some lessons
in diction.  Perhaps some lessons on stage would help.",1424390400,,470,4.35632183908046

6496521,5,B00LOCLBVU,"This movie made me laugh.  Alicia Witt plays such a cute character.  She fits in with a family who she thinks are her future in-laws, only to find out she is at the wrong family's house.  She doesn't fit in at all with the real future in-laws and that makes her want to go back to the other family.  She tries to remain upbeat through this whole mix-up and the things that transpire during this movie are so heartfelt and sometimes humorous.  It made me want her to go back to the other family.  I would recommend this movie to those who wonder how the movie is going to end,  Wonderfully entertaining.",1423094400,2,602,4.321428571428571

They did a good job contrasting the two families--Matt's family is cozy and warm and endearing; Will's family is cold and rigid and unthoughtful.  Actually, the scenes with Will's parents are worth the price of the DVD.  A good dose of humor mixed with drama and romance, with no profanity, no intimate scenes, and no cleavage (hooray!).

SUPERNATURAL/Night of the Walkin' Dead flicks year 'round.
The folks in this one SURE seem to have eaten a spoonful of
sugar before each scene. I gargle with eggnog in December.
That's okay... I still enjoy my Christmas cheer with a little
eggnog... heavy on the nog, but light on the eggs.

I, also, recommend PETE'S CHRISTMAS-----if you liked ""Ground
Hog Day""-----and, Bailee Madison is also in NORTHPOLE... and,
its---pre-announced 2015-release, sequel---NORTHPOLE 2.
([--Bailee is a VERY good actress. I think it was a ""no-brainer""
making two, different, movies--concurrently--to maximize on her

6496679,3,B00LOCLBVU,"This is a nice Hallmark Christmas movie that follows a fairly common script for romantic movies, albeit with a somewhat unique twist in the middle. This one is the story of a woman who owns an antique shop that is under threat of a buyout and her fiancee who is a successful real estate guy. They are supposed to visit his family for Christmas but end up travelling separately because he needs to wrap up a deal. Along the way, she has a number of mishaps in the airport that lead to her going home with her fiancee's brother which leads to a car accident. It's pretty clear from early in the movie that she will end up with the brother and not her fiancee who appears not to be her type from the start. The girl and the brother have nice chemistry in the movie and there are some other likeable characters. Unfortunately some of the romantic spark and payoff are obscured by repetitious scenes between the girl and her fiancee. This isn't one of the best Hallmark Christmas movies I have seen, but it is a pretty good one and worth watching if you like these kinds of movies.",1419033600,,1076,4.358208955223881

This is just a feel good movie where you find yourself rooting for the couple to live happily ever after.",1418860800,,325,4.872727272727273
6496684,5,B00LOCLBVU,my husband  and I enjoyed this movie very much,1418860800,,46,4.111111111111111
6496685,3,B00LOCLBVU,"This farcical Christmas romance works overtime to infuse the predictable story with highly manufactured scenes of calculating sentiment.  There isn't a genuine moment to be had amongst all the manipulative plotting and the cheat of coincidences that lays this story bare.
A woman named Alice (Alicia Witt) is sent by her workaholic boyfriend to meet his parents for the holidays.  Through a series of obvious contrivances, she loses her luggage, kills her phone, and supposedly just happens to run into her brother-in-law to be, who almost kills them in a car accident.  He takes her home where she insinuates herself into his family.  The mistake isn't discovered until his brother shows up and proves to be a total stranger.  They're all strangers.  But gee, didn't they have a lovely time playing at being a family.  Once the unbelievable mistake is rectified, and she finds herself with the right family, they prove to be more than a little certifiably nuts.  Could this impending marriage be an even bigger mistake!?  Will she trade one artificial relationship for another?  Merry Christmas, why not.

Whether or not you will like this movie will depend entirely on whether or not you can accept the bizarre set of circumstances driving this romance, and whether or not you can appreciate the actors playing these cardboard characters.

I found this movie to be a passable diversion (that I might consider watching again some time in the far distant Christmas future).  Otherwise, eh, I've seen better.",1418860800,,1507,5.052631578947368

6496687,5,B00LOCLBVU,"Girl gets engaged to Boy #1. On the way to meet Boy #1's parents, she runs into Boy #2 at the airport. Girl's phone is destroyed - thanks to Boy #2's clumsiness - so she can't get to the address for Boy #1's parents. But hey, Boy #2 has the same last name as Boy #1 - and has a brother with the same first name. Kind of. What a coincidence! So Boy #2 takes her home to spend Christmas with what she thinks is Boy #1's family - only to find out later it's all a big mistake.

Yeah, it sounds confusing. When I read the description for the movie, I thought it could either be really cute - or really contrived. I was delighted to find it was really cute. The writers and actors did a good job telling the story. It flows smoothly, makes sense, and even keeps you engaged - although you KNOW which Boy the Girl will end up with. It's the getting there that makes it fun to watch. If you like cute, romantic Christmas movies, check it out.",1418860800,2,935,4.054054054054054

6496715,2,B00LOCLBVU,"Rather than malign this movie without admitting responsibility, let me just be up front and say that I typically like cheesy Christmas movies (new and old)...and I'm certainly not going to deny that I enjoy a good ""chick flick"" here and there with my better half.  So I'll freely admit that I bought this movie (not my wife).  We were only 10 minutes in and I was ready to fling this thing out the window.  The story is poorly written such that no editing could have made it any better.  The acting is way overcooked (think teenage dramas) and the plot develops painfully slow.  It's like watching a movie based on the lame story of how your best friends met (that you get  tired of hearing about at parties).  I couldn't even really blow the movie with a spoiler, because I'm not sure there was one?  I'm typically not too critical of movies and wouldn't ordinarily review a movie I didn't enjoy...except that I have an interest in sparing the next guy and his wallet.

If anyone wants my copy, I'll give it to you and save you the expense, lol.",1417996800,4,1046,4.43455497382199

Ms. Witt and her leading man are a perfect match and give some of the most endearing and heart warming performances!  The story is lovely and this will be added to my 'must watch every year' Christmas movie list!

Obviously each guy's family background has made these two men the way they truly are; not withstanding the freedom of choice to be a nice person.  Alicia Witt gives a great performance.  This is a great Christmas movie!",1417910400,,364,4.523076923076923

6496724,4,B00LOCLBVU,"I wouldn't say this was my favourite Christmas movie of all time, or even my favourite hallmark movie but I still enjoyed it.  It's very light and fluffy so it's perfect to watch when you don't want to be bogged down with anything serious.  There were times when I thought the two lead characters were a little childish in their behaviour, but there were a lot of funny moments.  I have to admit I loved the family in this movie because they were so loving and warm towards each other, and I loved how they all got together to decorate the Christmas tree - even the grandpa.  Not many families do that, so it was lovely to see.",1417910400,,627,4.288135593220339

6496734,4,B00LOCLBVU,"At $8 this is a very pleasant surprise. The characters are appealing and you find yourself rooting for them even though you know it will end happily. All these Hallmark Christmas stories do. However, they did throw me a curve, in the story, that I did not see coming and that is hard to do having watched hundreds of these movies over the years.  Very interesting and enjoyable. Not a 5 star, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" but a very entertaining movie. You will not be disappointed in this movie.",1417478400,,492,4.52808988764045

6496737,5,B00LOCLBVU,"This is an adorable movie that points out how important family is, especially at Christmas time, and how different some families can be. I saw this when they showed it during ""Christmas in July"" and immediately put it on my list of ""must haves."" When it was released I ordered it to add to my own collection.",1417392000,,308,4.421052631578948
6496738,5,B00LOCLBVU,"I've only seen this one once but I found it outstanding in a number of ways.  For one thing, Alicia Witt was outstanding -- she sparkled and I loved the emotions she showed in her face.  Alright, corny, but that's the best way to state it simply.
  It begins with her character, Alice, very happily running the antique shop that she inherited from her father when he died.  Her boyfriend, soon to be fiancee, is the polar opposite of Alice:  she's a romantic, loves family things, old things, and isn't sure she wants to sell some of the things she has in her shop, though her business isn't doing well.  Her fiancee is a salesman, born to it and you get the impression that he can't imagine anything in the world that doesn't have a price tag on it and one that he's put there for a sizable profit. As soon as she says yes to his marriage proposal you know they're in trouble.
  This is not so much a comedy, though (as always) there are some funny spots.  It's up to fate to get them out of this marriage that has ""star-crossed"" all over it.  I won't ruin the story by telling you any more, but I will say that the title is very appropriate -- there are some very nice twists and turns along the way. It's a lovely journey and the entire package -- acting, scenery, storyline -- are a treat.  Hallmark usually manages this kind of thing well and this movie is no exception.",1417392000,,1375,4.286821705426356
6496739,5,B00LOCLBVU,"Very predictable, but also very heartwarming and fun to watch. This is becoming one of our holiday regular movies along with Miracle on 34th St, Wonderful Life, Elf, etc.

6496745,2,B00LOCLBVU,"I did not enjoy this movie.  I bought it based on the excellent reviews, but was sadly disappointed.  I did not like the main characters, I thought she had somewhat of an annoying and immature personality, and he was a mix of dull personality and boring.  I liked the idea of the movie, not having met your in-laws before, and just going by a persons name could cause a feasible mix-up.  However, it was not a movie I would ever watch again, the overall acting and the execution of the story line was severely lacking.  I was bored about 20 minutes into the movie, and couldn't wait until the ending.  This is not a DVD I will every watch again, I will try to resell it or pass it on to someone else.",1417219200,2,700,4.225563909774436

6496766,5,B00LOCLBVU,"This is exactly what a Hallmark movie should be! Great characters with amazing chemistry, delightful dialogue and fun situations. It's a little bit predictable in that you have the engaged female and then the wild card male character is introduced which changes everything and makes the female character reevaluate her life choices and pick the man who is her true destiny. However, that is exactly the formula which works so well for Hallmark. This movie is clean, no bad language or indecent situations. Despite the formula they follow, there is enough chemistry, enough interesting developments, and enough well-done secondary characters to make it memorable and great to watch again and again. I really cared about these characters and was invested enough to actually purchase this DVD for myself.

6496791,4,B00LOCLBVU,"There were a few spots in this movie where I thought it was a little corny, but overall the movie was very good. I only gave the movie a ""4"" because the characters seemed a little too ""happy"" at times, and it seemed a little contrived.
On the plus side, I especially liked the fact that there was a twist in the plot that I didn't see coming at all. I've watched a lot of romance movies, and never have seen this angle played out before. I also admired the female lead's persistence at her fiance's house that they play a game that showed her exactly how things stood with his family.
For those who are concerned about sexual situations, violence or bad language, there is nothing at all offensive.

6496801,5,B00LOCLBVU,"This story was fun to watch. It had humor, family values, family traditions, and a young woman who thought she was visiting her fiance's family. She discovers her heart is not on the original path due to challenges with her fiance's family and her trust and love of the new family she found. Of course it is all about timing and if it were not for the mix-up nothing would have changed for Alice, the main character. It is an entertaining show. Hallmark brings such nice shows for us to watch with a message always and in this one she had to follow her heart.
