2530737,2,B000ERVJHW,"Think of ""All You've Got"" as a volleyball version of ""Bring it on"" and you know what you will see in it. The film is produced by MTV Films and is full of cool soundtrack music. Instead of Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushuku and Gabrielle Union, the film features singers like Ciara and Adrienne Bailon, but you know, in this kind of film made for fun, it doesn't really matter whether or not they can act like Meryl Streep, and to be fair they are all likable, giving their best shots. I tried to like the film itself, but I find it very disappointing.

The story itself is not bad. You meet two rivaling volleyball squads The Madonnas and The Phantoms (which reflects the cultural and social differences). Three of the ace players of The Madonnas join the The Phantoms after one tragic event that happens to their school. Their presence naturally causes a discord in the team despite the strict teaching of the coach (Faizon Love), but they have to stay together to win the California State Championship.

The story is predictable, but so was that of ""Bring it on"" (not that part about the finals in Florida, but the friendship between the girls), so the predictability didn't bother me. No, what disappointed me is the lack of joyful energy of the characters and thrilling sports scenes. The film does not take any new steps in presenting the characters, and it seems the film is more interested in showing the DJs and musicians on stage (in the dance clubs where they go) than the girls themselves. The volleyball sequences are not exciting because of the absence of the athletes' movements that should be essential to the film's story. The use of stunts and stand-ins is understandable, but the scenes are poorly put together, giving some strange moments when it is obvious that the actors are only posing in the court, not playing the game at all.

Probably fans of the actors will enjoy the film, finding more fun than they expected, and Adrienne Bailon is actually very good. But as an ordinary film fan I think ""All You've Got"" needs something more, more power and energy, and something that would surprise the viewers.",1170979200,5,2120,4.67828418230563
2530738,3,B000ERVJHW,All you've got is a decent movie and a good watch although the storyline was a little predicatble. The acting is not Oscar worthy matieral... Ciara did a good job tho.,1162425600,2,167,4.419354838709677
2530739,1,B000ERVJHW,"This movie contained some of the worst acting I have ever seen.  I understand that this is an MTV movie and to not expect much.  But VArsity Blues was ALSO a sports MTV movie and it was very well made.  It seems like this script was only have made.  The characters weren't developed.  The rivalry seemed to shallow, there was no deep sense of orgin to it and it resolved too quickly between the two teams main stars.  The whole time watching this movie I felt as though I was watching Laguna Beach because they never designated a main character.  It felt like a reality TV movie.  It sucked.  The plot was not good.  Her dad dies in the very beginning BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW THE CHARACTER... before you could even relate to her.  It wasn't sad.  The opening scene is a vollyball game but you don't know whose side you are on yet.  Why Why Why?  It is worth the watch just to see Ciara suck beyond belief at acting (stick to the singing honey acting is NOT for you).  Someone compared this to a disney movie... No... at least disney movies have more developed characters and better actors.  SO watch it for the suckiness of it.  It is fun to rag about while sitting with your friends...",1149638400,7,1183,4.328767123287672
2530740,3,B000ERVJHW,"It's a cute movie, it would be fun for kids who love volleyball to watch. However, I play volleyball in college and honestly, it was hard for me to watch the actual volleyball scenes. From a volleyball players standpoint it makes us look bad because the girls are either really ghetto, or really stuck up, and talk waaaaay more smack to other teams then I have ever seen in my entire life. Besides that, it seems like a Disney sports movie, like something Hilary Duff would be in. It's probably good for kids 10 - 18, any younger or any older than that I don't think would like it. It's got a pretty good baseline to it, and if I didn't play volleyball or know anything about it I would enjoy the volleyball scenes alot more.",1149552000,17,725,4.338235294117647

2530746,4,B000ERVJHW,"My daughter is an avid volleyball player at age 13.  We wanted to see it since there are not many movies about volleyball.  We all watched it and there is a lack of Oscar winning acting but for a tween/teen, it was entertaining.  My wife and I did feel like the story seemed to go on just a tad bit too long, but overall, we were entertained.  My daughter really liked it.  If you really like volleyball, it's worth a few laughs to watch once.  I would watch it again in a few months after I have forgotten everything about it.  It has a very similar storyline to the ""Bring it on"" movies.",1452124800,,589,4.15929203539823

2530757,5,B000ERVJHW,"All six of you made my day.  This DVD is in my computer every day. It's a pleasure watching you play, as I loved Volley-Ball during teenager.  I was a good one too.  Nobody could block me.  I jumped fast. I killed fast forcefully - to the right or to the left of the block (Best trick). I'm your big fan.
""Jennifer Pea"", you and I have something in common: I used to give free Math's tutoring to my classmates on Saturdays in early 70's from 9AM to 12PM noon. You do have some outstanding qualities: You're simple, unique, and dress like a female Angel.  Tyler, that was some kind of ""holla""! You did it with style. ""Gracias""! They should give your cast an Academy Award.  Even if you don't receive an ""Oscar"", know this: You have earned 60,000.00 bonus points to heaven, because you make me smile daily.  You surprised me with Ali presence.  She shines and glows.  Way to go, gals, including your coach and staff!  You taught us that Life is a team!  It's team-work!  Life is like a group of football players in a field. Each player tries his best , to be a good team member of his group.  So are you in your volleyball team, and so are we in this society; trying to be a good team member. You are a great team. I'm watching you right now on my PC.  Thank you very much.  May God bless you all with your families?

I wish i'd stopped it when I heard the bad words!! I'm very disappointed and won't be allowing her to watch this movie until she's a few years older!!

2530801,1,B000ERVJHW,"I love volleyball, so when I saw this title, I thought I'd give it a try.  Although the volleyball scenes are passable, the plot is ridiculous, and the acting is terrible, not to mention the really offensive stereo types.  All of the Hispanic girls in this film are made up to look like BRATZ dolls, and sound more like they live in the Bronx than SoCal. Having the Anglo girls fuss over how the ""Latino boys"" were looking at them was obnoxious as well.  Having one of the main conflicts be the ""Barbies"" vs ""Ghetto Girls"" made every single one of the characters seem shallow and completely unsympathetic.  The DJs calling the games at a supposed National title match was just absurd, and the teams taunting each other on court was ridiculous (every coach I've ever played for would make us run until our legs fell off for taking our minds off the game long enough to do that - not to mention that it's an amazing example of bad sportsmanship).  I applaud the fact that they tried to make volleyball the focal point, but that didn't begin to make up for the bad acting, the contrived plot, and especially the racial stereotypes (those were really offensive).",1243728000,2,1158,4.57487922705314
