8424216,4,B004CZZZ5Y,"Along with Morgan, Blow Up, and Darling, Otley portrays an iconic time in London. Carnaby Street, the Kings Road. A fun an innocent time when everything was possible. I lived in London then, and vividly remember the scenes on Portobello road. Like Morgan, just a bit of fluff, but still fun to watch",1526083200,,299,4.660377358490566

8424218,5,B004CZZZ5Y,I am glad this became available on DVD (although its availability is limited) and it is well worth ordering. Tom Courtenay is the itinerant living in Swinging 60s London who inadvertently gets caught up with spies. Some hilarious situations and some sparkling dialog from @Likely Lads' authors Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (and a small role for James Bolam). I hadn't seen this since the early 1970s and it still looked good in 2014. It gets five stars in the 'SPIES AT THE ABC - VAMPIRES AT THE ODEON - CULTURE AT THE COSMO' and is worth searching out.,1410566400,3,556,4.57
8424219,5,B004CZZZ5Y,"Avengers  Steed and Peel did this sort of thing better each week than this movie does. Tom Courtenay does alot with little to work with and without an Emma Peel. Romy Schneider, a suitable spy character, and I never saw her lovelier. Unless you an afficionado(like me) and/or lived in London, and/or want to  take a trip down  of Portobello Road,then pass on this.",1361318400,2,364,4.65625
8424220,4,B004CZZZ5Y,"London at height of hippedom and Gerald Arthur Otley is a part time thief and antique dealer, he goes from girl to girl searching for meals and a bed to sleep in.
One night he stays at the wrong place and wakes up in a field by the runway at Heathrow (or so I recall).
Tom Courtney is great, the cast is excellent and it has lots of laughs, particularly when Otley takes his driving exam.
No one saw the movie when it came out and it died a quiet death except in the hearts of a few (such as myself who scoured the shelves for years looking for it).
Now it is here at last, great!
Not really  a 5 star movie but a memorable one and thus I rate it a 4. Enjoy!",1301097600,10,658,3.8740740740740742
