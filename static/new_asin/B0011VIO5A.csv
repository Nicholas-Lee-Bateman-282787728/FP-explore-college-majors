8242612,5,B0011VIO5A,Personally these are hands down the best shows on pbs... I remember watching these with my oldest son now eight when he was a tiny baby.. The music and characters drew all of us so much I memorized that birthday song for his first birthday and to this day still sing it him. Broke our hearts when they cancelled it. Now we can show his 14 mo old brother and he's getting into then add much as the rest of the family . Truly a great find and if you do buy it!!,1393977600,,459,3.946236559139785

8242616,5,B0011VIO5A,"I have bought several of the Big, Big World DVD's, and my granddaughter absolutely loves them.  She is one year old and sits to watch the DVD with a big smile on her face.  She get excited during all the music portions of the show and dances.  These DVDs are the best purchase I have made so far as a new grandmother!  I would absolutely recommend purchasing them.  I'm going for the whole collection, and will purchase some for gifts.  I want to share them with everyone!",1219276800,2,472,4.367816091954023
8242617,5,B0011VIO5A,"How many of us grown ups know a Snook in our lives, or worse yet find they might just be one big sloth at the end of the day, my little sister cannot help but make the comparison and I am not sure how to take it yet there is something about It's a Big, Big World which has evidently inspired a young generation to take this show to heart, adopt it's ways and become environmentally friendly. I could be a mellow sloth, how great would it be but just to chill and sing sleepily all day. This dvd contains more favourites from the series and some songs we love to sing ... It seems like wherever I go
I end up finding new things to know
The more I look the more there is to see
In this land of discovery
This is a land of discovery
We're in a land
Land of discovery
Reach out your hand
Land of discovery
This is a land of discovery

Hey lana lana
Lana Lana way oh...................

Hello moon
Yellow moon
You tell me it's bed time soon
So we sing this mellow tune
Goodnight, goodnight

Keep a watch
Overhead
When we all go to our beds
Baby frogs and marmosets
Goodnight, goodnight..........

Bear in the Big Blue House was a defining children's show for a new generation of Henson fans and Mitchell Kriegman's new puppet piece embodies all the things I recall from my own childhood, a sense of good trumpeting over evil, with ideals greater and braver than merely the pursuit of ones self fulfilment but instead conveys the idea that we are all responsible for our world and eachother and presents a perception of the world which is compassionate and all embracing, these are great dvd's to show to the kids and they enjoy them as much as I, the songs are memorable and the stories and characters are instantly likeable, we sing the songs often.",1214265600,3,1759,4.321212121212121
