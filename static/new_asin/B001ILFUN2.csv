8311067,3,B001ILFUN2,"In no shape or form is this a good movie, nor does it make sense. But I had a hell of a lot of fun watching this with my friends. The level of absolute absurdity and lack of story coherence made viewing this one of my better movie watching experiences.
If you enjoy watching horrible movies and making fun of them or laughing at how bad they are, you'll have a good time.
The plot, if there really is one, is about Gabe Snow and his adulterous wife trying to fight off a vampire named Clausferatu (the name of the Tooth Fairy apparently) who decided to pretend to be Santa Claus. Oh and then the real Santa shows up and they fight. And there are ninja nuns named The Silent Knights. And there's a were-rabbit. And a severed head on a toy train. And almost 95% of the dialogue is Christmas puns. This movie's a lot of fun. I'd recommend it.",1442188800,3,839,4.217391304347826

8311069,5,B001ILFUN2,"From the Ninja Nuns, to the Zombie Elves, to the Clausferatu, TWO FRONT TEETH is a hysterical indie send up on Christmas horror movies. Written and directed by Jamie Nash, the writer of ALTERED, LOVELY MOLLY and EXISTS.",1384214400,,219,4.7894736842105265
8311070,4,B001ILFUN2,"Are you tired of Scrooge and the Grinch reforming, Charlie Brown's sickly little Christmas tree becoming a miracle tree, or are you slightly sick from too much egg nog, cookies, and claymation on TV? Two Front Teeth is the perfect low-low-low budget Christmas camp.

Gabe Snow is a reporter for a National Enquirer like tabloid, out to expose the evils of Christmas. This year he finds out the evils are real, as he pursued by demonic killer elves. His wife, Noelle, is a bit of a psycho, a nice change from the scared cringing little woman. In fact, Gabe is more the scared cringing one. They set out to find someone to help them survive the night.

There are laugh out loud references to the claymation Rudolph type tv shows. Some gore but it's all cartoonish. Two Front Teeth is trashy campy straight to DVD fun.",1360627200,,815,4.575342465753424
8311071,1,B001ILFUN2,My god! I guess I made a mistake buying this movie (and paying international shipping). After seeing some vamp elves attacking people I got my peak when a relative of Dracula meets Santa for a fight!!! Too much for my critic eye!!!!!!!!!,1325289600,3,237,4.666666666666667

8311073,5,B001ILFUN2,"Johnny Francis Wolf is the most promising young actor in American Cinema. Period. His performance only is worth the price of the movie. Don't miss it...

8311074,5,B001ILFUN2,"Johnny Francis Wolf turns in a polished and entertaining performance as GABE, the hapless antihero in this creative, entertaining and visually stunning tongue-in-cheek stab at the/a darker side of Christmas.
