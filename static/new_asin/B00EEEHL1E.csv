5910389,5,B00EEEHL1E,"I like this movie because it really gives us insight on the struggle the deportees have to face daily just to live in their native land some people who left their native land as babies who get deported and they don't have any money, family or housing to go to.",1388793600,,260,4.22

5910391,5,B00EEEHL1E,This movie captivates the viewer from the beginning to the end. It tells the often untold but gripping realities of Jamaican deportees against the backdrop of everyday life in the Caribbean island. This movie gets 5 stars for authenticity.,1387324800,3,239,5.153846153846154

5910394,4,B00EEEHL1E,"Three members of Jamaica's widespread diaspora return to Kingston involuntarily through deportation on drug-related charges. A mother of small children from Toronto, a privileged school boy from London, and a drug enforcer from New York City.

Despite having lived their entire lives in the bright lights of big cities, the three characters quickly find themselves humbled, abandoned, exploited, and in once case, broken, by their new identities as deportees. Deportees in Jamaica bear a stigma as lawbreakers and are not allowed to legally work. Neither can the three return to the countries of their birth--Canada, Great Britain, or the United States.

So, in order to survive, the deportees must enter further into moral dilemmas, make compromises, and chip off parts of pride and dignity in order to navigate a labyrinthian bureacratic immigration policies.

Filled with heartbreak, dread, and a small light of hope, this movie is a revelation on the human face of immigration and a reminder that those caught in the net are human beings.",1382745600,27,1042,5.265060240963855
5910395,4,B00EEEHL1E,"I love movies where the characters are unconnected at first but intersect as time passes. I think the story lines accurately portray some of the differing and realistic situations that deportees can find themselves in, for better or for worse.  Decent acting, and I loved the accents, the scenery, and the music.",1479081600,,312,5.0

5910412,5,B00EEEHL1E,"This was a really good movie. I enjoyed it, showed the trials and tribulations, that deported people go through when they are compelled to live in a country though they were born in, don't know nothing about it, because they left when they were babies and the only home they knew were the U.S or Canada, and Great Britain. Their struggle was real, and it was entertaining and informative.",1443484800,,388,4.63768115942029

5910419,4,B00EEEHL1E,Interesting perspective on the lives if Jamaicans that were forced to return to their native land and had no real knowledge of their real culture. It highlighted the US justice system's flawed laws regarding another ethnicity if color. Great movie!,1432512000,,248,5.225
5910420,5,B00EEEHL1E,"The set was great, the story was excellent, but the authencity of the actors was not good.",1431907200,,90,4.352941176470588

5910431,4,B00EEEHL1E,"I think the movie was really well done and the story is authentic. The fact that the cast was not all Jamaican doesn't have much impact on the actors delivery, so that doesn't bother me being a Jamaican myself. The only thing that would have been nice to see is the more progressive and cultural side of Jamaica like if they delved more into our music and/or Rastafari; but it really wasn't a necessity.",1414800000,,403,4.45945945945946

5910436,5,B00EEEHL1E,"Excellent Movie.

I had no idea of the plight of those who are deported. Watching it made me extremely grateful for my life. I applaud all the people who worked on the film to bring it to fruition. An important film, it needs to be seen by everyone.",1409097600,,249,4.1875

5910442,5,B00EEEHL1E,You can really feel the turbid nature of a reinserted  immigrants life through  the tempo of the film it rarely rests. I found myself constantly recalculating the position of facts and following the ride. It has a message but its not preachy and I don't feel force feed. Its good.,1402185600,,280,4.58
5910443,5,B00EEEHL1E,Well done and very entertaining movie.  Surprisingly good performance by Tatiana Ali she showed a lot of versatility playing this role.,1402012800,,135,5.428571428571429
5910444,5,B00EEEHL1E,laws should be changed for those with minor offensives but its just to much money to be made overall  the movie was very good and full of heart !,1401494400,,145,4.0
5910445,5,B00EEEHL1E,"This movie was so amazing to see how things work in another part of the world in kingston ja. These people are already poor and the wars they have there are crazy about little things which they will take your life so quickly for...tatyana ali  played a really great part in this movie this girl was really strong due to all she had been threw losing her kids, rape, lied on and people refusing to hire her! The drug game is live or dead ! Good movie",1399852800,3,449,4.160919540229885
5910446,3,B00EEEHL1E,"There's good action here, and I watched it, but it's not one I'd like to see again.  Great insight into what happens to those deported and the adversity you have to go through.",1399852800,,176,4.333333333333333
5910447,5,B00EEEHL1E,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, SOMETIMES THE BEST MOVIES DO NOT COME TO THE THEATRE BUT GO STRAIGHT TO DVD, FOR EXAMPLE CODE BLACK ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES ARE EXCELLENT MOVIES FOR THE MOST PART,  SO DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IF IT WERE NOT IN THEATRES THEN I TS NOT WORTH IT, YOU CAN MISS OUT ON SOME GREAT FILMS.",1399334400,,301,4.189655172413793
5910448,5,B00EEEHL1E,"Since the reviews were so mixed, I wasn't sure how this one was going to turn out. It was surprisingly good. I had no idea of the high amount of deportees to Jamaica.  This film dealt with the lives of 3 people who were deported back to Jamaica because of crimes (all drug related). Even though they'd made stupid decisions that prompted their deportation, I really felt bad for them. Seeing their stories and how they got caught up shows that bad things can happen to good people. This movie also shows the seedy side of Jamaica -- the side tourists don't see. What I liked is that some people had a happy ending, and some didn't. The film was very realistic. It also reinforced another belief I have: no matter what problems we have in America, I sure as hell wouldn't want to live anywhere else.",1398470400,8,798,4.428571428571429
5910449,4,B00EEEHL1E,"Wow....I never knew this type of thing was going on!  Being deported to a place you know NOTHING about over things that can be easily resolved in the country you've called home...wow!! ALL governments are soooo corrupt!!  This will make me look at Jamaica & other countries much different when I visit again.  =(
P.S. - LYRIQ BENT was THE BEST part of watching this movie!!! DEE-LISH-USSS!  And Kadeem Wilson....exceptional actor!!!!",1398211200,,433,5.056338028169014
5910450,4,B00EEEHL1E,GOOD MOVIE THAT ILLUSTRATES LIFE IN OTHER CARRIBEAN COUNTRIES...WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR INEXPENSIVE ENTERTAINMENT..DIDNT KNOW DEPORTEES FACE A STIGMA IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES..GOOD FLICK,1396569600,,184,6.708333333333333
5910451,4,B00EEEHL1E,"I though this was a well written and directed dramatic story, of the harsh realities that deportees can face. I came to understand that it wasn't filmed in Jamaica but Trinidad instead but the scenes looked authentic, the action for me was rich.",1395187200,,245,4.72093023255814
5910452,5,B00EEEHL1E,It is a very good movie.  Kinda like Shottas. It is a must see movie.  A friend of mine referred it to me.,1394928000,,106,3.5652173913043477
5910453,4,B00EEEHL1E,Good movie for anyone that was born outside the US but lived here since young childhood. You are a stranger in your own land.,1394668800,,125,4.25
5910454,5,B00EEEHL1E,"Home Again:
I was impressed, (and not a little) by the execution, written lines, acting, storyline, the authenticity portray of the environment and culture, and cast chosen for this movie. The budget for this movie did not hinder season actors from giving a five star performance  commendable! Putting everything else aside  the movie brought home the realities of individuals who have been subjected to deportation for infractions in judgment. However, the consequences and realities they face upon return were heartbreaking to even consider as a reality, far less view. Something must be done about this situation. The movie Home Again was truly entertaining as it graphically portrayed the human condition in all its complex abnormalities.  Well done gang, well done! Side note: Mr. Lyriq Bent is a gorgeous looking man. I have no idea if his character as a person matches the exterior - Nevertheless, that is a most handsome, regal looking man of African origin!",1394409600,2,966,5.17948717948718
5910455,4,B00EEEHL1E,"This was a difficult movie for me to watch . . . maybe too much realism . . . definitely a lot of sadness. When my husband and I passed through Kingston on our way to our all-inclusive vacation club resort, what was portrayed in the movie was EXACTLY what we saw  . . . poverty . . .  crime . . . drugs . . . violence . . . and you name it! If that's Home Again, then  I would NEVER want to go home . . . talk about a good place to be FROM! Home Again is worth watching but not for the faint-of-heart.",1393804800,,501,3.6203703703703702
5910456,2,B00EEEHL1E,"Concept is good, but the execution is tame. I am JAMAICAN and to see a bunch of trinis and non jamaicans pretending to be jamaican was insulting. The story line is ok, but not all together true to life. Real JAMAICANS will watch this movie and cringe.",1393718400,4,251,4.361702127659575

5910460,5,B00EEEHL1E,"Not low budget and very clean crisp colors.
But this is a movie that is great for the family. Especially ones of which are decendants of Jamaicans or other Islands in the Caribbean to see how deportation affects life.  Great for Jamaicans living outside the country to see the homeland.
I truly enjoyed it.  I was able to show my son what life is like back home for many of our own personal family members.",1392595200,4,406,4.4

5910464,3,B00EEEHL1E,Interesting story about a subject that isn't publicly spoken about often. This effects every family in the united States if they are aware of it or not. We all have relatives or friends who may be subject to deportation.,1390867200,,220,4.666666666666667
