8205626,4,B000SKKCVO,"This DVD contains a very solid performance from Agent Steel and it is very much worth having if you are a fan or are just getting into this group's music.  My understanding is that this footage is from the last show of the 1987 tour, which occurred after Chuck Profus (drums) and John Cyriis (lead vocals) moved from L.A. to Tampa, Florida.  The DVD is a fine documentation of this superb metal band that should have been much bigger in its heyday but somehow got lost in the shuffle.

That being said, the very good performance on this DVD does not, in my opinion, represent Agent Steel at the height of its powers.  The lineup in the DVD is not the classic one that featured both Juan Garcia and Bernie Versailles on guitar, though the two guitarists  featured in this live concert footage are more than up to the task technically (one of the guitarists is James Murphy, who would go on to much greater acclaim in the world of guitar playing).  Also of note is the tepid, lackluster response of the Hammersmith Odeon crowd.  Perhaps it is because there is virtually no visual footage of the crowd from that show and/or perhaps that the audio of the crowd response was not recorded very well, but it seems like no matter what, the audience response is very 'flat' or subdued.  To his credit, Cyriis strives to ignite them several times between songs, but unfortunately seems to receive almost no reaction back from them.

The set list here omits most of my personal favorite Agent songs (e.g., 'Guilty as Charged', 'Children of the Sun', 'Chosen to Stay', 'Agents of Steel').  Of note, the cover herein of Judas Priest's 'The Ripper' is really disappointing because the arrangement and execution are lacking - not vocally, but instrumentally - as compared not only to the original Priest track but also to the Agent Steel version that was recorded and performed earlier on by the classic lineup.

Of course, anyone who is very familiar with Agent Steel is acutely aware of the exceptional and somewhat unique vocal abilities of John Cyriis.  Cyriis is from the Halford/Tate school of metal vocals, and in my opinion, he was able to 'hang' with or surpass those greats in the extreme highest register notes (some would refer to them as screams, but that characterization sometimes connotes shouting or yelling, which is not the case here - the high piercing notes are very well controlled).  He regularly zooms right up there and is able to sustain the really high notes very well. (The former comment notwithstanding, Cyriis is neither Halford's nor Tate's equal in the lower to mid registers nor is he their equal overall, but damn, Cyriis can hit some great high notes).  Here, as expected, Cyriis is very, very impressive, but I have seen and heard him noticeably better overall on other recordings (i.e., even more amazing).

Although the band would later have both a partial reunion of the classic lineup that did not include Cyriis (who was replaced by Bruce Hall, an extremely impressive singer in his own right) and a later one that did include Cyriis - even if only momentarily - the true 'magic' of Agent Steel as a band IMO is in those first few recordings (with all due respect to the later 'Omega Conspiracy' and 'Order of the Illuminati' era of the band with Bruce Hall on vocals).  If you already like Agent Steel or are just getting into its music, I believe you will be pleased with the performance on this DVD.",1409875200,,3429,4.69
