31131,5,0780613252,"I used this video in the classroom as a prelude to a writing assignment.  Both the students and myself found it both entertaining and informative.
Even though Robin Williams was his usual funny self, you could tell he was truly ""touched"" by some of his experiences:  especially when he met Stubby.
I highly recommend it as something the whole family would enjoy.",972777600,11,362,4.82258064516129
31132,5,0780613252,"We bought this video for our daughter who has recently taken a fascination with dolphins.  My husband and I are both big fans of Robin Williams so we  figured this would be GOOD documentary on dolphins.  We were not  disappointed.  Although I must admit, my daughter was - she's only 2 yr.  The humor was above her level and what was left was too much like a  documentary for her.  But my husband and I love this video.  Typical Robin  Williams humor and the occasional evidence of true emotion for the dolphins  comes through.  Excellent choice.",966816000,15,546,4.572916666666667

7789435,5,0780613252,"Great movie with Robin Williams showing how intelligent dolphins are...recommend this movie to all ages. Shows Robin Williams's humor with himself and the dolphins. Very humble man who is definitely missed. At least we have his numerous movies, interviews etc to remember him by.",1422662400,,279,5.363636363636363
7789436,5,0780613252,"Robin Williams was such an erudite, gentle soul. This is a wonderful look at Dolphins and a sweet tribute to the natural affinity of humans and animals.",1416873600,,152,4.666666666666667
7789437,5,0780613252,So glad to finally own this video.  Williams is his usual hilarious self - but also greatly informative and real.  I think he must've been a dolphin in another life.,1385164800,,165,4.466666666666667

7789439,5,0780613252,This Video tape was really good.  I only wish it was available on DVD too.  Robin goes to many different locations and has a lot of fun learning and teaching about dolphins.  (there was a little about cows too)  I really enjoyed it.,1282262400,,232,4.325581395348837
7789440,5,0780613252,"This is an EXCELLENT video.  Funny, endearing, and informative, you learn about dolphins and laugh along with Robin William's antics.  If you like Robin Williams and you have rapport with dolphins, you are gonna LOVE this video!  It was made in 1995 by PBS as part of a series on animals.  Well worth having around for those rainy days when you need a few laughs and some beautiful nature to view...",1162339200,,399,4.577464788732394
7789441,4,0780613252,"Part of the ""In the Wild"" series, this episode focused on dolphins.  Robin Williams was the host, and he had the envious opportunity to interact with several species of dolphins, both captive and wild.  Needless to say, it made for fun viewing, even if there had been been no humor from Williams.  But no fear -  Williams was his zany self.  His ad-libs with the dolphins mostly made the show even more entertaining!

Four stars.  Anyone with an affinity for dolphins will like this.",1154822400,,483,4.678571428571429
