1082091,4,6305609659,"This triple threat DVD pack includes what can be considered Star Treks 7, 8, and 9.  Each of the DVD discs were created individually, so there is no continual theme, and the older the DVD the less fun features.
Insurrection being the newest, has the most to offer with commentary from the cast, and a behind-the-scenes special.
First Contact is a blessing alone to enjoy in wide screen, and be rid of that awful pan-and-scan, which the VHS was a victim.  It also includes Spanish subtitles and English captions (Insurrection does not).
And with Generations being the oldest there are the Spanish and English language options, but also the added piece of calm, knowing Picard and Kirk will never get knocked out of track, due to the limited lifetime of VHS tape.",979862400,,761,4.757575757575758

However, it is impossible to keep the same crew always bring us new adventures. In  Enterprise-D, which lead by Jean-Luc Picard, the new crew brought us  another different style from those lead by Kirk. It also reflects the  changes of view in our society within these years. In Star trek VII :  Generations, although it's a tragic loss of Kirk's death, the film has made  the formal announcement of the connection between two generations and  beginning of new ones. In First Contact and Insurrection, we can meet the  biggest ememy of human beings from both inside(greedy) and outside(the  Borg).

1082198,5,6305609659,"I'm a Star Trek TNG fan, as I'm sure a number of people looking at this product are. I bought this boxset and received the first 3 movies of the 4 movie set. Now, I liked all of the movies, just want to get that out there. But...sometimes, the movies felt more...underwhelming. More like drawn out episodes rather than full blown movies. I don't intend to sound negative (after all I'm giving 5 stars), but I found that I felt a little...bored with the films in certain parts, like they weren't engaging enough. Over all though, I did enjoy all three of them, found them to be well rounded TNG films that captured the essence of this particular Star Trek universe.",1329091200,,664,4.4958677685950414

1082203,3,6305609659,"These are the first 3 ""Next Gen"" films, but there is a 4th: ""Nemesis"".  I thought I would point this out since it cost me $20.00 on a bet as I couldn't remember what the 4th movie was.  $20.00 later, I know.  That's the problem with online searches, they're not always 100% correct.  I guess I should've gone to StarTrek.com to make certain.

As I recall, Generations was the best of these because you had the 2 ""generations"" of captains playing off of each other which made for some great Trek moments, plus you got to see Bones one last time before his passing.

First Contact, being the first Trek film without Kirk, pretty much felt like an elongated TV episode to me.  Way too much story, nowhere near enough action and special effects considering what some of the other films of the time were doing (Matrix, etc...).

Insurrection, again, an elongated TV episode which is part of why the Star Trek movies and TV series have suffered.  I don't believe it's saturation as much as it's repetitiveness.  After awhile, all the shows and episodes feel the same because of the Trek pattern: open with problem, fix problem (but come close to failing) and end with poignant epitaphs, mix in some story-telling and basic effects, and voila' -a Star Trek episode/movie.

You know what I think Star Trek needs?  A John Woo or Peter Jackson infusion.  And if Quentin Tarantino could do a movie that wasn't spattered with blood, he might make an interesting film too.",1135900800,,1459,4.65234375
1082204,4,6305609659,"After The Classic Crew final bow in Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country,the torch would be passed to The Next Generation crew to pick up the movie franchise. Unfortunately, after four installments,the TNG era films has yet to capture the big screen experience like the classic Trek films.

ST Generations (1994)passed the torch between the classic crew and the Next Generation. The historical meeting of Captains Kirk & Picard is what Trekkers longed for. Unfortunately,the result is a convuluted extended TV episode,a very irksome Data,an impressive yet unnessesary destruction of Enterprise D ,and a very shoddy death of our beloved Capt Kirk. Impressive at first ,but repeated veiwings makes it's flaws all the more obvious.

This special edition DVD gets points for featuring scenes cut from the original film(Kirk's orbital skydive), as well as tons of extras not featured on the first edition. The commentary is interesting as Brannon Braga and Ron D. Moore, the film's writers confess that they tried too hard too please and now can't help but cringe at certain scenes.

Of the four films,ST:First Contact(1996) is the best ,even ranking with The Wrath Of Khan,The Voyage Home,and The Undiscovered Country. Unlike the other TNG films,this is the closest to a real movie as it is fast paced,action packed and has agree of warmth and humor.

Patrick Stewart is always a commanding presence as Capt. Picard(Kirk may be the best Captain,but Stewart is the best actor to sit in the chair),and his quest for vengence against the Borg (stemming from being assimilated by the collective in TNG's Best Of Both Worlds episodes) is captivating as well as terrifying. And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations.

A great battle scene with the Borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes alternating between 2063 earth(which show's the first earth warp flight with Zephram Cocherane,later followed up in ST Enterprise) and a war zone with the Borg on the new Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all too convienient TV ending.

Aside from these minor flaws ST:FC is a movie to be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike.

After successful movies(which are usually even numbered)there is usually the problem of the filmakers second guessing fan expectation, injecting a bigger budget into the following movie and hoping to capture the previous film's magic. For ST Insurrection (1998), the budget was more than the average box office take of the other films. A better movie than most of the Oddies(except III),it had some very funny moments,and Patrick Stewart seems to be having fun as Picard as he turns his back on Starfleet to protect a paradise planet that the Federation wants to harvest for it's resources. The story would've been better suited for TV,and considering the great quality of episodes on the spin off series Star Trek Deep Space Nine (The Dominion War),you also feel the writers should've strived for more on the big screen.

Unfortunately the Box office tally was lower than expected,despite being a very entertaining film. But it wouldn't be a box office disaster like the next movie. ST Nemesis (2002) (Which bears the burden of a knuckle-headed decision being released between a Harry Potter movie and LOTR The Two Towers)is both the most praised and harshly criticized of the ten films. The biggest problem(aside from the whole Trek franchise being at an all time low)was the story using ST II The Wrath of Khan as a template. The Next Gereration's final mission as they are led into a trap by the new leader of Romulus who has a deep connection with Capt Jean Luc Picard. The sub plot of finding yet another Soong android didn't make things any better, as well as a cheat on the fate of Data.

The belief that Romulus would be controlled by not only their sub race,The Remans,but also make the Praetor,a human clone of Capt. Picard,as well as having an agenda to destroy the Federation(A repetitive,yet empty plot device).Nemesis has many great moments as well as the most exciting ship battle scenes ever seen in a ST movie. But as much as the TNG movies try,they are still big screen TV episodes.

Despite the many gapping plot holes as well as hearing fans rip this movie to shreds(It ranks above Search for Spock and Generations),Nemesis is still an entertaining movie(How could you top the collision scene!!!).",1131753600,,4514,5.014686248331108
1082234,5,6305609659,"Generations is what I would consider the good movie in this set.  Insurrection is a little better.  The best by far is First Contact.  Everything about the Borg is creepy - I love them!
If you are looking for a COMPLETE Star Trek movie boxset - I don't recommend this set.  However if you simply want to just own the first 3 TNG movies - than this will do the trick.  I do think all 3 movies are very well done, which is the reason for 5 stars.",1077840000,3,444,4.0

1082236,5,6305609659,"If you are a Trekkie and don't have these three movies yet, it would be a good idea to get this pack. fans of the original star trek series and the first 6 star trek movies (who probably don't like the next generation much anyway) might discourage you from buying the pack. however as a fan of the next generation series and the occasional reader of the books, I found these movie to be very well done and worth owning on DVD. Generations: is the perfect transition between the original Star Trek and The Next Generation. First Contact is my favorite, it has satisfied my curiosity about the Borg! Insurrection: on the outside it's about preserving a small settlement of humans on a planet that everyone have their eyes on! but if you look deeper, it's like any other episode of the TV series, it has a moral point summerised by Picard's question: who the hell are we to decide the next course of evolution for these poeple?
eventually, the choice is yours: to miss out on a great adventure or to go where no man or borg has gone before!",1056844800,8,1037,4.43455497382199
1082237,5,6305609659,"Classic film making, and the Star Trek Next Generation movies are a perfect example of it.  Star trek Generations, a great movie to bring in a crew with, I love it.  Star trek First Contact, one word, rocks. This film blows away any of the new Star Wars movies(1 and 2).  Star Trek Insurrection, it may have gotten bad reviews(go figure) but I loved it.  These 3 movies never get old, I watch them over and over again.  But before I stop, I would like to say that one of the reviewers said if you had all ready bought the DvDs don't get this...If someone is smart enough to like Star Trek, I don't think there so stupid that they would buy the trilogy again when they had alreay owned it.",1052524800,2,688,4.221374045801527
1082238,3,6305609659,"I slightly prefer The Next Generation crew over the crew of the original series, and the quality of their movies is about on par with the original crew's. As it goes, Star Trek: Generations is a good, solid sci-fi/adventure. It's got some intriguing ideas, tons of stunning visuals and thrilling action sequences (the crash sequence is simply awesome), and a memorable meeting between the present and past captains of the U.S.S Enterprise.  It is hampered by a somewhat slow beginning and the obvious plot holes in the climax, but it's atoned for by the poignant death of one of the most beloved characters of Star Trek lore.
It's Star Trek: First Contact that not only firmly settles The Next Generation crew as a force to be reckoned with, it also represents Star Trek at its very best. From the visually mesmerizing opening scene to the heart-pounding conclusion, First Contact is a first-rate, action-packed thrill ride. The Borg make for a genuinely frightening villain, and director Jonathan Frakes nicely pumps the tension up, building suspense scene upon scene. The film's most memorable setpiece, a battle on the ship's hull, is the most exciting sequence of the entire Star Trek series. A must see, even if you're not a Trek fan.
Star Trek: Insurrection, as a follow-up to First Contact, is a massive disappointment. The story simply doesn't hold interest, the conflict is silly and a total bore, and Ru'afo, the movie's villain, is easily the weakest antagonist of the entire series.  Lackluster as much of the movie is, there are still several things I'm willing to give it credit for.  The special effects are first-rate, the script and cast deliver about a dozen laughs (only The Voyage Home is a funnier entry), and some of the action bits are kind of fun (the shuttlecraft chase), if also rather sparse (it's easily the least action-oriented of The Next Generation films).  All those aside, Insurrection is the worst of The Next Generation films.
If Star Trek: Nemesis is truly the crew's final adventure, then it's a disappointment. While certainly not an awful or even particularly bad movie, its relentless mediocrity is still sometimes hard to slog through. The movie tries delivering high-octane action, but unlike First Contact, this is not a thrill ride.  Don't get me wrong, there's lots of action here.  The car chase is pretty cool, the phaser fights are fast-paced, and the final space battle is by far the most elaborate action sequence of the entire Trek franchise (there's even a spectacular crash scene between two starships).  However, the movie is at best, sporadically exciting, and at worst, an uninteresting bore that repeats too many plot elements from its predecessors.  Let's hope the Next Generation crew gets one more film to give us a truly memorable cap-off.",1043280000,3,2801,4.982869379014989
1082239,5,6305609659,"I really think that people have to move away from the ""old Star Trek"" and stop thinking your going to get the feeling you did when you watched the ""Search for Spock"", and the ""Wrath of Kahn"". This is the NEXT Generation, and I absolutely love their new movies. These three movies are the excellent, which trekers and non-trekers can enjoy. They are all packed with killer action scenes, suspence, awesome special effects, and exciting characters. I just hope that they keep on making these quality movies.",1035417600,,505,4.816091954022989
1082240,3,6305609659,"With three movies under their belts after taking over the cinematic franchise, I think the NextGen crew has done a decent if not consistently good job of continuing the legacy of `Trek on the big screen. Even though they had the semi-misfortune of starting off their celluloid voyages with an odd-numbered sequel, I thought `Generations' wasn't half-bad (Now I'm sure there's some nitpickers who're saying, ""Wait a minute... Paramount quit numbering the sequels when NextGen entered the scene!"" That may be so, but for many fans, myself included, the curse of the odd-numbered sequels still stands!). Data's coming to grips with his new-found emotions made for some of the silliest `Trek comedy I've ever had the fortune of watching!
Being a big fan of the Borg in general and Picard's Borg alter-ego Locutus in particular, my nod for fave NextGen flick naturally goes to `First Contact'. The super-hammin' ""The line must be drawn HERE!"" scene is one of the greatest moments of `Trek overacting. I daresay it puts some of Kirks' best moments of method acting to shame!
I've discussed `First Contact' with other fanboys at the local nerd herd corral (read: comic-book shop), any many of them didn't like the fact that Zefrem Cochrane, the guy who invented warp drive in the Star Trek universe, is portrayed as an alcoholic with dreams of avarice. Personally, I found his alcoholism and lack of joviality & enthusiasm to reflect the post-nuclear-holocaust era he lived in. It also showed that he was flawed- he wasn't perfect, as all human beings are and likely will always be. There's also rumors that Cochrane is an allegory of Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, who's been portrayed as a booze-binging, pill-popping womanizer in more than a few unauthorized tell-all biographies.
I thought that `Insurrection' would've made a decent two-part TV cliffhanger episode, but lacked the scope to be a good cinematic outing. Also, many of the silly moments were rather over-the-top, even more so than what is usually expected in a cinematic `Trek, the best examples being Data offering himself as a flotation device, and Riker using a joystick to manually control the vessel. Still, it isn't all that bad a show to sit through as far as odd-numbered `Trek sequels go.
 Okay, so I've reviewed the movies, now it's time to review the set. Upon hearing about this collection's release, I was hoping that it would include Special Edition versions of the three movies- showing and/or restoring cut scenes, more trailers & teasers, and other such additions. I was relishing the chance to check out a those moments from `Generations' (Kirk's skydive landing, Soran torturing LaForge, the alternate Death of Kirk scene, etc.) and `Insurrection' (Ship's library hijinks, Data's rescue of aliens he pushes off a cliff, etc.) that never made it past the cutting room. Unfortunately, the boxed discs are the exact same ones that were released singly. And since I'd already collected them when they came out one at a time, there wasn't any sense in me grabbing more of the exact same thing.
So, unless you don't already have any of these DVDs, I wouldn't recommend you get this set. However, if you don't have any of them, and you're a completist when it comes to your Trekkie digital video library, then I won't try to stop you...

1082241,2,6305609659,"Don't get me wrong, I love Star Trek just as much as the next Trekker.  However, the whole point of DVD's is the added features (in my opinion).  This set included VERY LITTLE in the way of features.  Woo-hoo I can skip instantly to Kirk's death.  The one comfort I take in buying this set is that DVD cases take up less space and weigh less than VHS...  I expect better from Paramount.",994204800,6,386,4.232876712328767
1082242,5,6305609659,"This box set is a much better value for the money than buying the 3 films separately.  When the ""Classic crew"" made their last film in ""The Undiscovered Country"", many were hoping ""The Next Generation crew"" would start moving to the big screen.  As was the series, these 3 films of Picard and company are excellent.  Although many expected to see both crews complete in ""Generations"", just seeing Shatner and Stewart play off each other is a ball.  By the way Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan appears unbilled, but it's the same character she played in the series beginning in the second season.  By the way those of you watching DS9 and wonder where Worf got promoted, it's in this movie. Also, yes that is Tim Russ soon to be of Voyager on the Enterprise B in the opening segment.  Seeing the Duras sisters finally get their reward is worthwhile. (fans of the series know what this means).  By the way a Star Trek Generations CD game was made after the movie and is even more fun.  It includes clips from the movie.  First Contact and Insurrection are excellent too.  Although Glenn Corbett's Cochrane from the Classic Trek episode Metamorphosis is more convincing I think than Cromwell's in First Contact.
