8694676,1,B00R9O4VK0,"first and for most, this is anti religious. the main man nobu tells joan not to pray to god he's going to squash god under his boot. the main man nobu is a complete fool and at times it's hard to watch. it's kind of like the evangelion garbage. they are arrogant in things that don't exist like 40 foot robots. the bible in the psalms chapter 2 reads ""God laughs them to scorn all who claim to kill God. The angels do as well I'm  sure. It's the same garbage as the past just has a new face.  the animation is awesome and the characters are likeable minus the cusing in stupid places. any time a cartoon uses a lot of cusing it shows us a lack of intelligence in the writing.",1440288000,3,675,4.067669172932331
8694677,5,B00R9O4VK0,"Pretty good. The second collection needs to come out asap. Fighting between two worlds with robots. All the fighting happens on the Eastern Star as the Western starts to slowly invade because their planet is dying. Most of the first collection is building alliances, learning about life, and maturing along the way. This series has slight romance going on. Nothing major but I hope to see more progression of that in the second collection. This anime goes at the perfect pace, not fast like a lot of anime lately, but not too slow where its boring waiting for things to happen.",1435449600,4,577,4.7227722772277225
