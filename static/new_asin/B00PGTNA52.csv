6798653,5,B00PGTNA52,"I can only imagine 2 kinds of people reading these reviews,
people who saw the movie and want to reminisce by reading other people's takes on it,
and people who didn't see it yet and are really trying to decide to buy it or not.

If you haven't seen this movie,
buy it,
sit down with a couple good friends/family that also never saw it.
You'll laugh for an hour and a half,
and have a lifetime of dumb ""inside jokes"" to share afterwards.

Great, clean, funny, wonderful movie.
My version didn't have any extras other than the UV digital copy and disk (see pic)

I'm not sure why it's rated PG, but I can't recall any scene that would be uncomfortable for little ones,
maybe the ""fire swamp"" could be scary for about a minute, but not really.

I already had it on DVD, but bought the Blu-ray ($11.23 minus whatever they knocked off the price for Prime Day) so I could have the Ultraviolet Digital copy for my Vudu account.
No expiration date is listed on the UV digital copy, and it authorized without a problem for me.

6798712,5,B00PGTNA52,"Every now and then, someone makes one of those rare movies that crosses the lines of romance, action, fantasy, fairy tale, and a story for all ages. And isn't annoying either. With snappy dialogue and lovable characters, ""The Princess Bride"" is a classic tale of high adventure, danger, true love, screaming eels, and Sicilians who talk too much.

A bored little boy (Fred Savage) is sick in bed, is told a story by his quirky grandfather (Peter Falk). In it, young lovers Buttercup (Robin Wright) and Westley (Carey Elwes) are separated when Westley is apparently killed. A few years later, the heartbroken Buttercup is unwillingly affianced to the slimy Prince Humperdinck. As if that weren't enough, she's kidnapped by a trio of mercenaries.

But things go wrong for the mercenaries -- a mysterious masked man is following them, and he defeats each of the mercenaries with his swordplay, strength and wits. He also knows quite a bit about Westley's fate -- and Buttercup soon finds that he IS Westley after all. But Buttercup is only a cog in Humperdinck's evil plot, and now it's up to Westley, gentle giant Fezzik (Andre) and vengeance-seeking Spaniard Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) to save her.

If ""Princess Bride"" had been done in a halfway serious manner, it wouldn't have been even remotely interesting. It would have been just another kids' film. But with William Goldman's tongue-in-cheek script and entertaining characters (Miracle Max, anyone?), it becomes something a lot sweeter and funnier.

Rob Reiner has a deft, wry touch that matches Goldman's story, and he does a superb job of keeping the grim moments lighter than they would have been otherwise (""We'll never make it through!"" ""Nonsense, you're only saying that because no one ever has""). With scenes like the torture machine, Miracle Max and Westley's three duels, Reiner keeps it deadpan rather than openly comic. But there are also scenes of touching romance and reconciliation, and some very good swordfights for Inigo.

And the dialogue (penned by Goldman) is full of quotables -- lines like ""Inconceivable!"" ""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die,"" ""I'm not left-handed!"" and ""As you wish"" are more or less immortalized. At the worst of times it's solid; at the best, it's memorably quirky.

Yes, the title is about Buttercup. But she's a pretty pallid character compared to Westley, Fezzik and Patinkan. Elwes always seems to be winking at both the characters and audience, while Andre is lovable as the sportsmanlike, superstrong giant, and Patinkan as the discouraged Spaniard searching for a six-fingered man.

And Billy Crystal makes a brief but insanely good appearance as the Miracle Man, an embittered medieval healer with a very peeved wife (Carol Kane, who steals the scene with her shrieks of ""Liar!"").

Crammed with adventure, true love, swordfights, pirates, deliciously casual villains, and a clergyman with a speech impediment, ""The Princess Bride"" is an adorable comic classic. A must-see.",1460937600,2,3011,5.130612244897959

Recently my (now 38 year old son) suggested I might enjoy reading the 30th anniversary edition of the book which contained both tooth the 20th and 30th year forwards to the book. It was great!!!!! The forwards and the book together were so clever and so entertaining. I decided I needed to see the movie again.
It is certainly a classic and the casting was amazing. However, as I have found in most books made into movies, the books are usually superior. I recommend both!",1448582400,,726,4.345588235294118

8687831,1,B00PGTNA52,"This has to do with the vendor as I personally consider the movie to be Porter darn near perfect. I thought I was purchasing an updated edition of the movie but, apparently, the vendor who sent my copy thinks I'm stupid. The box has a cover hot glued to the cover and you can see an older version of the jewel box plan as seat. Open the box and it's clearly not an anniversary edition as it would be imprinted on the DVD. Unreal that they thought noone would say anything about this.",1533600000,,483,4.204301075268817

8687839,5,B00PGTNA52,"It is inconceivable how they could make such a good movie. This is one of those movies that the story is being told and periodically you are drawn back to the reader and listener to see what they think of the story. The reader is a grandfather played by Peter Falk and the grandson that is listening to the bedtime story is Fred Savage. Watch the expressions on Prince Humperdinck's (Chris Sarandon) face as he gets foiled again. Exceptional good story and actors. Lots of mush and unexpected trials.

See Peter Falk again with Cyndi Lauper in ""Vibes"" (1988).",1524528000,,559,4.646464646464646
8687840,5,B00PGTNA52,The only thing about this movie that is new to me is that I now have it on Blu-Ray. I absolutely love this classic. Ive seen it many times at the theater and on VHS. Thats why I had to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  The Princess Bride is a must-see for kids and adults alike. Great story telling. Great message.,1522800000,,301,4.101694915254237
