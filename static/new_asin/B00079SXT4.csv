8046431,1,B00079SXT4,"I purchased this video to help me train clients who are interested in improving their fitness for golf. Unfortunately, for me it was a waste of money. The video presented what I am doing with my clients already. I was looking for more in-depth discussion of the muscles involved in the swing and how to train the body as a whole to prepare for golf season. Instead, the video presented 10 stretches and exercises that i have my clients working on already.

Perhaps this video might be of some use to a non-professional looking for some stretches and rudimentary exercises. However, as a personal trainer, I was disappointed in the content.",1140134400,,639,4.756756756756757

8046434,5,B00079SXT4,"I bought golf fitness because I felt with all the golf lessons I've taken through the years no instructor has taught me how to stretch or exercise to improve my game. This DVD has given me some easy to use stretches that really seem to be helping my game. I am not one to write reviews, but this DVD was worth the time. I recommend this DVD to all golfers like myself that need to improve their flexibility and strengthen muscles specific to playing golf. I never realized that even with good technique if you can't rotate your head and spine through the proper range your not going to get the desired result. Thanks for a DVD that didn't waste my time.",1104537600,,653,4.360655737704918
