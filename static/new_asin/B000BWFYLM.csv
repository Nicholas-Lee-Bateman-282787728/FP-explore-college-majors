I will pass this movie down to my grandkids, who may think the Lion King was the first movie about a Lion.  I think the Lion King was based on this movie.",1399593600,,276,3.875

8093543,1,B000BWFYLM,"Leo the Lion is a classic anime series; basically it's the second season of Kimba The White Lion. Confusingly, the series has been made available on DVD by more than one company. These DVDs by the Palm Beach company could not possibly have been checked for quality before being released. The sound on each and every episode is unbelievably, horribly distorted. Yes, you can make out the words, but you'll think someone kicked in the speaker in your TV set. In addition, each episode is shortened by having as much as 5 minutes cut out of it--there is no reason for this in a DVD release.

Inspect Volume 1 immediately if you decide to buy it anyway--the first production run included a wrong disc as one of the two discs in the set.

I don't know why they couldn't have produced a decent product. The English version of this series was dubbed uncut; why are these shortened versions on these DVDs? This classic series certainly deserves better treatment. If you look around the 'net a little, you can find better DVDs of this series.",1130889600,13,1033,4.608695652173913
