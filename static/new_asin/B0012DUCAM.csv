8245194,3,B0012DUCAM,The area the DVD covers is worthwhile.. but there are so many omissions to cities and villages that one really does not obtain the totally flavour of this mystic and vibrant land.,1344729600,,179,4.625
8245195,4,B0012DUCAM,"Sicily is the convergence of many cultures---the Southern door of Europe. It has so much history that, for a plain person like me, it is impossible to grasp in a few weeks before going there. This video gives you an excellent historical tour of the island, its most important historical sites and its current condition. The narrator speaks with a British accent that is understandable and filled with excitement. The photography of the video is excellent. However, I think that the quality of the film could be improved. It is like a video before the digital era. A small shortcoming considering how nice is its content. I strongly recommend it.",1291766400,,645,4.872727272727273
