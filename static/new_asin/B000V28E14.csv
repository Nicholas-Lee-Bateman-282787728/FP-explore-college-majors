8216273,5,B000V28E14,"I love this! Great film! Exposes the ridiculousness of the American Lawn.  41 billion pounds of CO2 are emitted from leaf blowers and other gardening engines and 800 billion gallons of fossil fuel used in the upkeep of the lawn--in the age of climate change.... it's unsupportable.  Polluting mowers, poisonous pesticides, toxic fertilizer, waste precious water then repeat the process over and over... forever. Crazy.  In the age of climate change.... it's unsupportable.",1470009600,,472,5.438356164383562
8216274,5,B000V28E14,"Everyone should see this video, especially if you have--or ever plan to have--a lawn!  It's well-made and gets its point across very well!",1426982400,,138,5.0
8216275,5,B000V28E14,"I found the ""Gimme Green"" to be an eyeopener when it comes to the subject of green lawns.  What a cost to our health and fresh water consumption is the lawn.  I had no idea.  I believe that those who watch this film will be converted one by one to getting rid of the poisonus, water guzzling lawn.",1290729600,,297,4.086206896551724

8216277,2,B000V28E14,"An interesting commentary on the modern American lawn.  Movie did a good job of keeping my attention and it was actually enjoyable to watch.  Numerous ""facts"" were give throughout the movie; however, citations were not provided.  Many factually inaccurate comments.",1216339200,,265,5.575
8216278,4,B000V28E14,Interesting look at the lawn-care industry and our cultures' beliefs and attitudes about the lawn. Fresh water depletion briefly discussed.,1199145600,2,139,6.0
8216279,5,B000V28E14,"Gimme Green is a short and witty documentary on the American tradition of the lush green lawn. It offers three major insights: 1. People judge others by the quality of their lawns. 2. Lawns are a huge amount of trouble and expense (hey, guess I already knew that) and use an inordinate amount of water -- grass is the largest single irrigated crop in the U.S.A. 3. When we can't have real grass a bunch of us think the next best thing is fake grass...gotta have green...yikes.

Delightful and insightful, this movie provides support for those who want to take back their weekends and free up their garages for better things than herbicides, fertilizers, and lawnmowers.",1197417600,9,669,4.767241379310345
