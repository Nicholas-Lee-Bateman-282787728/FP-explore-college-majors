7923849,5,B00004UCI0,"An excellent introduction into urine therapy.  Presents many people who have used UT with great results, including an HIV+ man who discontinued all of his medications and uses UT exclusively and is doing much better than while on meds.

The video shows that UT has been around for centuries and is currently practiced in many parts of the world.

This presents a fairly well rounded view of the subject including medical doctors who support it, and some who don't.  Yet no MD said it would do you any harm.  Interviews included a NYC fire captain who spoke of his use and his benefits from UT, plus the owner of ""Porta John"" who collects human urine and sells it to the pharmaceuticals who turn it into prescription medications sold to the public at enormous prices.  In fact, many over the counter products have either urea (a major ingredient of urine) or urine in them including Murine eye drops.

If you are a UT practitioner, this is a great video for showing friends and family.  They may not accept UT, but it might change their view of those who do.",1114732800,7,1057,4.585106382978723
