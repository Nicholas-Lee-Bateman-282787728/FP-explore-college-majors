3010354,5,B000Y09V2O,"Great fights, decent quality picture, remember these fights are already classics. Would buy again if I needed to, hours of entertainment and education if thats what you are looking for.",1224288000,2,185,5.2
3010355,5,B000Y09V2O,"I'm a big MMA fan and I bought this set the second I saw it on Amazon. I have had no problems at all with the image quality on any of the dvds in the set. I have played the discs on a number of different dvd players (both newer and older models) and on a number of different televisions (including a 54"" flat screen) and have never had any problems. Don't expect HD image quality, but it is perfectly acceptable. This collection is a great value and has a lot of great fights on it.",1216425600,,482,4.03125
3010356,5,B000Y09V2O,"I actually found this set to be very watchable.  As far as the other reviewers comments on video quality, I own a Sony VW50 Projector and use a DVDO VP50 Video Processor (which could account for my better image quality)... I have about a 10' screen (10 foot).  I found this set to be very good, especially given the options for people out there to be able to purchase old DVD events.  I noticed a few moments where there were some compression issues, but it wasn't during actual fights (glitter coming down with lots of colors comes to mind as one of those moments).  Truth is, some of the events weren't that high quality to begin with (Pretty much all 4 of the UFC Japan events suffered from bad lighting).

I have no idea why Zuffa isn't selling ""official"" DVD's of the early years, but since they aren't, we have to take what we can get, and this is a very acceptable set in my opinion. 5 stars.",1210032000,7,899,4.3273809523809526
3010357,2,B000Y09V2O,"I'm not reviewing the content of the DVD. There are plenty of good MMA websites for that. I am actually trying to inform the consumer of what they are getting before they plunk down their hard earned money for this item. This appears to be from Australia based on a website address on the back of the box, although it is non-region coded (not region 1 as listed) and will play on any DVD player worldwide. Each DVD contains two events. That means 4-5 hours of content crammed on a single disc. In order to achieve that, the DVD authors had to crank up the compression so high that the video quality suffers noticeably. When the images on the screen are fairly still, it's about VHS/VCD quality.  However, when there is any motion taking place on the screen, the images become pixelated and fuzzy - badly lacking in detail. If you have a 13 inch TV the loss of image quality isn't that noticeable.  On a big screen TV (not even a high-def model, mind you) it is extremely evident. To the point of being distracting at times. If you are used to the region 1 DVDs offered legally in the US, the difference is night and day.
Having said that, the sad fact is, 9 of the events in this set are from the dark era of the UFC.  They were never offered in the US on VHS or DVD by SEG, the (former) copyright holders.  There were European VHS (and eventually DVDs) issued, but not too many people in the US have players that do the PAL format. So if you can handle the poor video quality, this is a good way to see those fights until Zuffa offers them for sale legally in the US.
If you are interested in this set, you may want to pick it up quickly as once Zuffa (the current copyright holders) find out it's being sold on Amazon, they may take action to have it's sale blocked.",1200700800,30,1768,4.252976190476191

8230432,4,B000Y09V2O,This is essential viewing for UFC fans. Unfortunately these events are not readily available on DVD from Zuffa so we're stuck with these DVD sets from Australia.,1424908800,,161,5.0
8230433,5,B000Y09V2O,"It does kind of tickle me to watch the earlier UFC bouts, but there is something more honest about the UFC in the beginning than what it is now, to me.

8230435,3,B000Y09V2O,"I've watched both the first volume (1 - 10) and this one (21 - 30) and by comparison this later set is of  lower quality.  The entire screen is usually badly pixelated, and cannot really be watched on a screen much larger than 20"" without tiring the eyes.  I assume this was caused by too much compression when making the dvds, although the originals might have been screwed up by the cable or satellite broadcasters.  But what are you going to do?  this is the only source I know of for these fights.",1368835200,2,501,4.344086021505376

8230437,4,B000Y09V2O,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights.  I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's.  It became just another DVD to the collection.",1349222400,,183,3.918918918918919
8230438,4,B000Y09V2O,"From 1997-2000, the UFC was underground and struggling. It was banned in most states, cut from cable and pay per view tv and losing money fast. Most MMA fans were denied the chance to see some of the best fights and fighters of that era. Fighters such as Kevin Randleman, Frank Shamrock, Tito Ortiz, Pedro Rizzo, Pat Miletich, Randy Couture and more.
These UFC events weren't broadcast on ppv or distributed on videotape and to this day have not been released on DVD by Zuffa, which baffles the mind. That makes no sense. However, if you want to see these great events which they are, you can only get them through here. The sound quality is good and the video quality is also good, its not as bright as the 31-37 set, but its very watchable and you see the fights and events from beginning to end! There were some great moments such Tito Ortiz winning the Middleweight Title, Randy Couture regaining the Heavyweight Belt, Kevin Randleman finally winning the Heavyweight Title, the classic Frank Shamrock VS Tito Ortiz fight and more. Very good product. Its about time that Zuffa and Dana White finally put UFC's 13-38 on DVD for the public to buy! What are they waiting for?",1296259200,,1175,4.626794258373206

8230440,5,B000Y09V2O,"I am thoroughly impressed with both the video and the condition in which it came.  This video set includes the greats who have made MMA what it is today.  And the set is in as good condition as amazon advertized it to be.

Thank you",1243814400,,232,4.111111111111111
