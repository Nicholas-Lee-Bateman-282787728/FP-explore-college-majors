1354970,1,B00004U5K5,"Okay, ADV REALLY owes me an explanation this time. I mean, this is undoubtedly one of the stupidest, strangest, most boring anime in the history of the planet. I might even go so far as to say that it is the WORST anime I have ever seen in my life! Okay, the basic premise was alright, and the character designs were okay. But there is NO character devlopment, NO good dialog, NO good action (despite the entire movie pretty much being a series of chase scenes). And what the heck is that blob creature? What the heck? I mean, this thing is so bad I couldn't watch it all the way through (even in Japanese). The music is pretty bad but the whole thing is really quite boring and strange and just plain... Bleh! Stay far far away!",1090886400,5,729,4.2898550724637685
1354971,2,B00004U5K5,"I had to watch the movie 3 times to find out what it was about, after I was done, I wished that I had never watched it to began with.
The movie is in the SD (super deformed, when the heads are much bigger then they should be) format, and considering the age of the tape the animation is good. However it is missing one major thing, a plot.  I think that it is supposed to be a spoof of a different movie, but if it is then I have never seen it.",996451200,,444,3.774193548387097

7923795,5,B00004U5K5,"Birth also known as Planet Busters or The World of Talisma, due to previous English dubs from Harmony Gold and Streamline pictures on VHS. This is a 1984 anime and is credited with being the very first direct to video released in Japan. Luckily ADV released this from the remastered Japanese print used on the R2 DVD release and the results are stunning. The colours literally jump off the screen.

The back story is Aqualoid was once a prosperous planet, but an attack from a mysterious life force, the Inorganics, transformeed it into a post-apocalyptic shell of its former self. When Nam finds a mysterious sword, he is suddenly the object of a planet-wide chase. With the Inorganics closing in, will Nam and his friends discover the secret of the sword and save their world? Or will they destroy Aqualoid in favor of a new Birth?

Birth was an ambitious, high production, experiment and is a must for any fan of vintage animation. The story is actually pretty good, it just takes time for it to unfold. At 80 minutes it's defintly worth picking up a copy up for a couple of dollars. One of the most memorable scenes is right at the end when the characters are in space and they talk to these deity beings about the meaning of life, only you hear no dialogue because human ears are not evolved enough to understand it yet.

7923796,2,B00004U5K5,"As now all-too-often, Amazon has mixed-up reviews for what are really TWO different products, the VHS tape of Planet Busters, and the DVD of Birth.  ""But wait!"" you say: ""Aren't they the SAME thing?""  Of course, the answer is a resounding NO!  Originating in the mid-1980's, Birth is a sloppily realized, overlong ( 85 min. according to the package ), seemingly unending chase between a tiny group of humanoids and their evidently robotic pursuers, termed ""inorganics""; Planet Busters was the commercial attempt to salvage this mess through editing, rewriting, and dubbing for U.S. television.  Unlike several of the reviewers here, I never saw the truncated TV version, so will confine my comments to the original.

Supposedly the creators ran out of money and were unable to finish Birth, leaving an unsatisfying attempt to tell a story about the death of one civilization sundered by some long-ago holocaust, and the rebirth that transports the characters apparantly unscathed into some unknown but presumably better future.  Unfortunately the metaphor for this transition is one long and relentless ""chase scene"".  If you watch this strictly to enjoy the rapidly-changing moonscapes, both literal and figurative ( the planet's inhospitable and now-largely uninhabitable surface, AND the main girl character Rasa's ""Jiggly-Butt"", as it's termed by her pursuers ) this has a lot of individual features to recommend it.  Character designs ( in addition to the aforementioned posterior ) are good overall, and most of the action which makes up far too much of this is at least fluid and well-done, considering this is by now approaching its third decade.  I especially liked Rasa and her strange flying ""disc"", but once it's smashed, though the chase goes on things lose a lot of interest.

Unfortunately, most of the dialog, such as it is, goes to the annoying Bao Lutzen, a would-be trader somewhat ""borrowed"" from Han Solo, in situation at least.  He's the kind of ""lecherous older-men"" characters popular around the time Birth was made, with a whiney, grumbling  vocal delivery somewhat like that of Lupin III. ( Of course I'm speaking of the original Japanese seyuu; as expressed elsewhere, the dub of this is too atrocious to bother with, though the stereo sound is worlds better. )  Other characters are more sympathetic, if too-bland, like Rasa's brother the would-be swordsman Nam, whose ""magic"" weapon is strangely ineffective.  Oddly, the trio of pursuers and their acolyte hanger-on appear much more interesting and all-too-human. Eventually they're replaced by ever-bigger ""inorganics"" who are mere monolithic giant robots totally devoid of personality.  Matters are scarcely helped by the occasional scene shifts back to the siblings' oblivious Grandparents having tea, unless it's just for a rest from the frenetic action of the chase.  Birth is not entirely without merit - it just quickly outwears its welcome with its seemingly endless rush to oblivion.",1339372800,,2971,5.262711864406779
7923797,4,B00004U5K5,"I saw this movie when I was a kid, but did not understand the story...Now more than 10 years later, I can see why...There is almost none, as some Japanese animations do.  Still the animation itself, directed by Kanada is superb in many aspects.  Any fan of good animation will love this movie.  This DVD lacks the ending dialogue!!",1301616000,,331,4.576271186440678
7923798,3,B00004U5K5,"I watched this OVA for the first time when I was around 10 and I found it hilarious. It kept on my mind ever since and I was able to watch it again now that I'm 27 and have a big ""anime maturity"". So what do I have to say about this? It's still hilarious, although I can add some more things like ""insanely hilarious"". Nevertheless, don't expect top of the notch story here, this is something more of a scene by scene with not much content behind it stuff. Anyhow, it has some great animation and graphic quality -keeping in mind is anime from the 80's- So, if you're looking for a great lough, simple-plot (and sometimes even a litte disconnected story-line), neat animation with great graphics, sci-fi anime with cool actions scenes, here's your answer.
Oh, great character design as well",1187740800,2,790,4.531468531468532
7923799,5,B00004U5K5,"I liked this dubbed verson WAAAAYYYY better then the newer  one on BIRTH,though essentialy the same movie but the newer one has different dubs,effects and restoration,it all looks and sounds great but I really prefer the older one better. It just sounds more natural and best of all Talon has the voice of Rick hunter from the robotech series lol
sweet!",1185840000,,353,4.786885245901639
7923800,3,B00004U5K5,"This story starts well. The artwork is highly reminiscent of the 60's stuff by Ralph Bakshi with smooth lines and women drawn impossibly sexy. The real problem is that the DVD starts to faulter about 2/3rds of the way through in a manner that suggests that they never had a story to begin with and so never had an ending that made sense. In the end you're left high and dry feeling had by the producers.

Nevertheless it is an interesting production as long as you don't get the idea that there's going to be a story in there somewhere. The artwork and the animation are pretty highly evolved for a DVD of this sort.",1172966400,4,616,4.356521739130435
7923801,4,B00004U5K5,"to previous reviewer:

i found the original dub of Planet Busters to be one of the most entertaining english dubs I have ever heard.  After finally getting Birth i was a little dissappointed in the original japanese diologue in comparison.  The animation in this feature has a lot of quirky elements and I felt that the planet busters english language edit brought out that quirkiness the best.  However, planet busters edit cut out a good amount of scenes from the feature (to presumably move the story along) however the story/plot is often convoluted because of this.  So I am happy that when I viewed Birth I saw alot of new animated sequences and even certain elements to the story are different (some good, some bad differences).  Of course the English dub on this ADV release is horrendously unwatchable (as usual), I was really hoping the english language version would be the Orion Planet Busters cut (maybe some day).

So overall:  this feature is a hidden gem of action packed and interesting animation (as previous reviewer stated), and it is different cut than the Orion Planet Busters release (which is my favorite and i will always have a spot in my heart for).  Still this release is quite a unique cartoon that any animation buff should check out.",1170374400,6,1264,4.788018433179723
7923802,5,B00004U5K5,"This title has a setting similiar to 'Nausicaa Wind of the Valley' and was made around the same time in 1984. So is it as good as Nausicaa? Not quite but it came close.

This is title is defintly a hidden gem and not known by even the most knowledgable fans which is a shame really as it's alot better than its reputation percieves. It's poor reputation is founded on the fact the title was originally released on VHS under the name Planet Busters and was given one of the worst dubs to ever grace the US. Thankfully on this dvd we have the original Japanese Soundtrack. YATTA!

The anime is made up of lots of chase sequences. So anyone who enjoyed Riding Bean, pick this title up. The Music is also very good resembling an 80's j-pop persona, so anyone who enjoyed Bubblegum Crisis should also pick this title up.

Overall i enjoyed this title as it was something very unique and i rate this title as a MUST BUY for casual fans and especially OTAKUS!",1138320000,2,952,4.367231638418079
7923803,2,B00004U5K5,"Back in the old days, lots of anime was made to satisfy the eyeballs of otaku fanboys with a lot of visual fluff but they mostly lacked plot and characterization. Such is the case with the oldschool feature, Birth. During some of the more action-packed sequences, you can almost sense that 20 years ago, people in Japan were ooing and awwing over the still somewhat impressive animation without worrying about having good characters.

The lifeforce of the  Universe has become unbalanced which has led to the appearance of a race of Inorganics (robots?) whose sole mission is to eradicate the Organics (humans) from all worlds. Thats when a mysterious flying sword, named SHADE, shows up. Supposedly, it is the key to destroying the cancerous spread of the Inorganics. A human named Nam comes upon it as he is riding a giant chicken-like beast and claims it for his own. Unluckily for him, the Inorganics know about SHADE too, and will stop at nothing to obtain it. Nam is helped in his quest to understand the nature of SHADE by his shapely ladyfriend, Rasa, and a lecherous spaceship captain and copilot, and an annoying little glob whose only speech is the word ""Munga!"".

If you like old school anime that has a lot of storm and fury but little substance in the style of MegaZone 23 you will love this anime. After you finish watching it, you feel as though sitting through it was a pointless exercise. Most of the characters lives revolve around driving around. I mean, what do these people do for a living? The music is your standard cheesy 80s electronic keyboard music. I will admit that for being such an old anime, the animation is pretty good. The Japanese voice acting was pretty average or below average, especially the always yelling spaceship captain. I haven't listened to all of the 5.1 English dub but what little I have is preferrable to the Japanese. The only extra on here is and Art Gallery.",1105833600,2,1913,4.704477611940298
