7878944,5,6304907125,"I bought this video for my niece's young son who is all about big machines.  Even though he sees big farm machinery on a daily basis he doesn't get to see it in action but at planting and harvest time.  He loved it.  I'd especially recomend it for kids who might not have a clue what a combine is, or can do.",1247702400,,308,3.935483870967742
7878945,5,6304907125,I have given this video as a gift to several children and it has made me a popular person.  The kids watch it so many times that they have it memorized (not to mention the fact that they now know their grains and minerals).  And they get very excited to see Freddy the Farmer.  The kids are happly...the parents are happy.  What a great deal.  Thanks Freddy!,969840000,,358,4.2835820895522385
7878946,5,6304907125,"I've watched this video many times with my toddler son. He likes it because it moves and is fun. I like it because I learn about farming and where food comes from. The visuals are great, especially the shots where  the camera is right next to the ground! It's similar to those construction  equipment videos, but this is more relevant. We're all eating, right?",947980800,,360,4.609375
