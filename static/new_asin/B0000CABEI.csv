1917776,3,B0000CABEI,"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is one of those films that really doesn't live down to its reputation as one of the worst blockbusters of recent years. True it does boast the usually reliable Daniel Craig's worst performance and least convincing accent, but approached without any expectations as an undemanding action movie it fills the spot between better films even if Stuart Baird's slick uncredited editing can't entirely hide the fact that Angeline Jolie is very obviously doubled by a man in some stunts.

Conventional wisdom has it that the original was so bad it put the audience off the sequel, but the genuinely dull Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life manages to do a perfectly good job of putting off audiences on its own. To call the plot derivative is far too kind: it might as well be called Raiders of the Lost Orb so closely does it follow the Lucasberger's plot arc (pun intended), but it's unforgivably action-lite, with Jan de Bont botching most of the few setpieces it does have. Jolie gives the picture more than it deserves but she can't compensate for Gerard Butler, who goes beyond his usual enthusiastically bland performance to deliver an enthusiastically gormless one, or the industrial strength bad acting from Ciaran Hinds, whose bland villain leaves the heavy duty emoting to his double-chin, while Simon Yam shows once again that it takes Johnny To's direction to get the best out of him. Nice title sequence but not much else going for it.",1198800000,,1474,4.826086956521739
1917777,5,B0000CABEI,Yeah! Girls can kick butt too! Lara Croft dishes out a lot of action. Tomb Raider brings closure to Lara about her father's death. Cradle of Life leads Lara to come to terms with what power can do to people if it is in the wrong hands. Both films are exciting action films. The content is more for older audience and not so much for younger children.,1195344000,6,350,4.2388059701492535

1917779,3,B0000CABEI,"I know nothing about the video games related to this movie, so I am viewing it strictly as a movie fan - and a fan of Gerry Butler.  What a dissappointment Angelina Jolie was!  Where were the director and the screenwriter on this one?  They sure missed the mark with the potential chemistry between these two people!  It is hard to believe they ever could have been in love at one time, let alone that someone who comes across as passionate on the screen as Gerry Butler did, could EVER have loved a character as wooden and stiff as Jolie's potrayal of Croft.  What a shame.  I think they were so interested in making this a vehilce for the marginally talented Jolie, that they forget all about the entertainment factor!  Special effect and stunts aren't all people want to see in a movie.  To sacrifice such natual, potential chemistry in favor of making a video game movie, completely stuns me.  Jolie's acting is in a word - terrible.  If you want to see a good performance, buy the two-disc set and view Gerry Butler's screen test in the special features section.  I think some of the dialogue was his ad lib (which was better than the dialogue in the movie!) and that scene is steamy and gets to the heart of the subplot that was the obvious motive for Terry Sheridan tagging along in the first place - and that's all they let him do - tag along! Croft states she needs Terry Sheridan and then proceeds to treat him like a bad child.  What a shame! It would have been a much better flick if they would have let the two actors and characters play off of each other more and let Gerry Butler do what he does better than just about any male actor his age out there - act.  The three stars are for his performance, by the way.  Angelina Jolie was great in Gia years ago.  What has happened to her?",1139097600,,1798,4.325373134328358

1917781,5,B0000CABEI,I have a large DVD collection and these two movies are the ones that are the most watched. I love these movies because they are pure fun adventure that takes place all over the world and in these wonderful environments that have never been seen before on film. Angelina Jolie is the best female action hero when she is Lara Croft. The character suits her perfectly. Tomb Raider 1 and 2 are nothing but FUN! I love them!,1072569600,16,419,4.384615384615385

stupid plot, cartoonish characters, wooden actors..

1917829,5,B0000CABEI,These movies are awesome! They are such a a thrill to watch. Angelina Jolie definitely kicks butt as Lara Croft!,1387756800,,112,4.65
1917830,3,B0000CABEI,"The Tomb Raider Collection is out and it contains both films,Lara Croft:Tomb Raider(released June/01)and Lara Croft Tomb Raider:The Cradle of Life(released July/03).I'm a Lara Croft fan in the  virtual world and have just about all of the series of video games. While the games themselves can blow hot and cold,generally they are well developed and fun to play. Thus I was anticipating the best when Lara came to the screen. Joli seemed to be a natural fit due to her shape and looks. However,I found both films way too long and complicated and Joli somehow didn't quite hit the right chord as Lara. They sure made her up like Lara,even accentuating her bosom with a push up bra to match her gaming alter ego. But in the end it is all for naught. In this collection and watching them nicely remastered,they seem better than I recall,but my original feelings still have to stand.
LC-Tomb Raider stars,among others,Angelina Jolie,Jon Voight,Chris Barrie,Iain Glen,Noah Taylor and Daniel Craig. The story finds Lara at home at Croft manor(a nice reproduction from the game).She receives a letter from her father,who has been dead many years. It tells Lara that she must find and locate two halves of a triangle that will bring about the destruction of the world;one piece at Angor Wat,in Cambodia and the other in Siberia. The trouble is the Illuminati are also after it. Lara gets to Cambodia just as the Illuminati are there. Lara struggles and gains possession of one half. The Illuminati agree to work with Lara to get the other half and they all travel to Siberia. Lara is betrayed and the Illuminati try to put the two halves together as the planets align. However only Lara knows how to solve the puzzle and she manages to put them together which takes her into an alternate existence where her father is. He beseeches Lara to destroy the triangle and not save him. This she does and the temple they are in destroys itself.
All the talk about planetary alignments,Angor Wat,the hierarchy of the Illuminati,her father's appearance at the end,the triangle of light,and on and on. It is all far too much detail for the viewer to properly absorb. The film needed to be paired down not only in scope but in size as well. Voight appears as Lara's father,and is actually Angelina's real father. And Angelina just isn't doing it for me being Lara. She is much too wooden. 3 - 3 1/2 stars.
LCTR:The Cradle of Life stars,among others,Angelina Jolie,Gerard Butler,Ciarn Hinds,Chris Barrie and Noah Taylor. The story here begins in Santorini,Greece. Under the Mediterranean an ancient Greek Temple is discovered by Lara and two friends. She recovers a glowing orb there. However another group of thieves is about and they steal the orb from Lara and return to China with it. The sphere is key to finding Pandora's box in the Cradle of Life in Africa. At the same time there is a rich man also looking for the box/orb. He wants to unleash a plaque onto mankind that he can capitalize on,so he sends his men to fetch it also. Lara enlists the help of Butler,an old friend who is now serving time in prison. For his help he will get a pardon and a new life. He gets Lara into China and steals the orb and a key to unlocking it. Lara unlocks the orb and sends data back to Croft Manor. However the rich man is there and he knows now the Cradle of Life/Pandora's Box is in Tanzania,in Africa. Upon arrival Lara is caught and she is forced to take the rich man to Pandora's Box. A struggle ensues in which the rich man ends up being killed when he falls into a pool of acid. Lara returns the box to its rightful place and leaves. Lara drives into the sunset.
Talk about your overkill on detail. This plot is even heavier handed than the last. There is so much to absorb about the Temple history,then a gang in China,an old lover,the orb and its history,Tanzania,the unleashing of viruses,shadow guardians,and much,much more. It would be good in a game but is way out there in a film. Again Angelina is just not doing it for me as far as being a Lara Croft. Nice seeing an early appearance of Gerard Butler,He had the best acting chops of just about everyone. 3 stars.
Extras abound in this edition of the two movies. They are far too lengthy to list,but they do include commentary,music videos,deleted scenes and lots of featurettes. Both films are in their original w/s a/r's and are clear and crisp.
All in all the extras get more points than the films themselves. The films are a little better than I recall,but both would have made better games than films. Angelina is just not up to snuff imitating Lara Croft and the films themselves are just too long and complicated. The makers did a good job of recreating Croft manor though,but the old butler in the games is replaced by two younger helpers. 3 stars.",1383696000,2,4796,4.629107981220657
1917831,5,B0000CABEI,These films are great fun and filled with action & adventure. Lots of cool stunts and a very enticing leading lady. I really wish they had made more of these films! Very nice pack.,1382659200,,180,4.323529411764706

1917835,4,B0000CABEI,"As a spin off of the original video game, no, not great. And Jolie wearing the famous 'shorts' only in the very beginning of the movie. But Tomb Raider is fun and she seems to be having fun. Peeps who enjoy the movie they're in always seem to be more fun to watch. Cradle of Life isn't as good (most sequels aren't huh?), and if the camera adds 10pds, it seems to me that silver outfit adds 30pds. Hopefully its the stuntwoman.

There's a lot of exciting action, the cinematography is great, there are a lot of interesting locales, the main character is likable enough - if you're the kind who likes to sit down and enjoy a bit of fun, stupid action with some unique twists and an Indiana Jones-like vibe, you'll probably enjoy watching these movies.

And if you find Angelina Jolie hot, well, that helps, too.",1353715200,,564,4.696969696969697
1917857,5,B0000CABEI,"I have been a fan of Angelina Jolie for many years and try to see every movie she has starred in.  These two (Tomb Raider and The Cradle of Life) DVDs are great action movies and show her acting skills match her physical skills. She plays Lara Croft, a wealthy adventurer and archaeologist.  I have watched these two DVDs numerous times because there is plenty of action and drama combined with enough conflict to make the story interesting.

My only complaint is that Angelina Jolie is a little on the skinny side but she does make the action scenes look believable through the magic of movies and her fantastic acting skills.  I would have liked to see her make more of the Lara Croft series.  Nevertheless, since this series, she has been in numerous great action movies such as SALT.

In conclusion, if you like seeing Angelina Jolie in action films, you will like this DVD set.

1917860,5,B0000CABEI,"The Laura Croft films involving Angelina Jolie are impressive to say the least.  They combine a strong and powerful but extremely feminine female lead with no apology for her being in charge of her team of quirky men.  She is not infallable but she is certainly the equal of any man presented as an action hero (like a female Bourne without all the grittiness of that series of films).  You should go into the movie expecting it to be based on a video game in the sense that this is a fantasy pair of movies, not some spy-thriller.  If you object to the special effects of the Mission Impossible series then you might not enjoy the feats and wild items found in both Laura Croft films but again, if you love character-driven, action-packed contemporary adventure films with a touch of the fantastic thrown in, then you should really enjoy them.  Angelina's acting is brilliant and you actually feel for the characters.  It is sad that the franchise wasn't better received and ended after two films (which had high production values I might add).  Both Laura Croft films had some of that charming flavor found in earlier action/adventures movies such as Erol Flynn's 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' or James Coburn in 'Our Man Flint' or even the better 'Tarzan' adventure flicks.

For the price of this combined set you can't really go wrong and I have literally watched each of these films at least three or four times apiece because they have good dialogue and wonderful acting which is not hidden beneath but rather in tandem with the high-paced action.",1347148800,7,1554,4.729629629629629

1917865,4,B0000CABEI,"Tomb Raider / Tomb Raider 2 Blu-ray Review

Distributor : Concord (Germany)

After years of thrilling gamers with her archaeology and acrobatics, Lara Croft finally made her way to big screen in 1991 in the form of Angelina Jolie. Taken as a cross between Indiana Jones and a modern day action movie, the films are best viewed from a less than serious frame of mind.

Released in a Blu-ray double pack in Germany, it is the second movie in this set which has so far seen a limited release on the high definition format. With no current UK or US release planned, this import  provides a problem free alternative for buyers who wish to have both movies in their Blu-ray collection. On loading either disc, you are first presented with a menu screen with various options including play, extras, chapters etc. Selecting play starts the film with the German soundtrack selected, however this is easily switched over to English using your audio selection. Thankfully there are no forced subtitles when using the English track, therefore making this set a stress free purchase for English speaking collectors.

Both films in this set are presented with 1080p 16x9 2.35:1 transfers however it is the second movie which shines through here. The print on the original film in the series although relatively problem free does not contain the amount of detail or rich colour palette which is present in the sequel. That is not to say that it is a poor transfer, just somewhat outweighed by the transfer on the newer film.
At times, certain scenes in the original movie do comes across rather well with reasonable colour and detail showing through, whilst other scenes can look a little washed out so it's really a mixed bag overall as far as this print is concerned. Also worth noting is that this release presents the first movie uncut which is nice after many years of UK DVD releases editing some of the more violent scenes. The second film in the series does not have the same transfer issues, with colours and fine detail appearing sharp and consistent throughout. Black levels appear relatively deep and although the print here will never compare with the newer blockbusters, it still looks pretty impressive and is certainly the best that this film has ever looked.

Audio is presented on both movies with a DTS English soundtrack which makes for a fine upgrade from the DVD releases. Audio is clear, gunshots and explosions are loud and powerful and the music score fills your speakers creating a rich vibrant atmosphere.

Extra features are also well catered for. Both movies have directors commentary tracks which are  relaxed and informative as well a having a number of deleted scenes, alternate endings, interviews, trailers, music videos, alternate opening titles and making of features which altogether round up to present a worthy package.

All things considered, this region free 2 disc set from Concorde makes for a rather impressive release for the Tomb Raider fan. With overall decent print and audio quality and extremely good extras, there really is no reason not to purchase this set should you be looking to add these films to your HD collection. With a UK import price of around 18 even the cost seems reasonable considering that you are getting two films for your money. Could the films themselves look any better? Well, the first one probably could, however that would require a brand new scan and the sort of attention it's never likely to receive, as for second film, I'm not so sure. The choice as they say is up to you.

A fine effort from the distributor, Lara Croft comes crashing to Blu-ray in a double bill which shouldn't disappoint.

Born into wealth, groomed by the elite, trained for combat.

1917866,4,B0000CABEI,My children are finally at the age where they are interested in Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider series.  This double feature is great bang for the buck at nearly 1/3 the price of individual purchases.  Enjoy!,1300665600,,207,4.5675675675675675
1917867,5,B0000CABEI,"""The Cradle of Life"" is not generally available in blu ray for Region 1.  This is an EU version which may be played on Region 1 blu ray player.  The subtitle is in German only.  There is no English subtitle.  The menu is in German only.  The audio is available in English or German, however.

It would be nice if:
1.  all future blu ray and DVD are ""Region"" free;
2.  the manuafacturer should upgrade their manufacturing quality standards around the globe; and
3.  there is language option for both menu and subtitle.

These are good movie.  Highly recommended.",1298937600,,561,4.565656565656566
1917868,5,B0000CABEI,"This German import is awesome!! The only complaint is the soundtrack defaults to German and the menus are German...but hey should have expected nothing less. The prestine 1080p transfers make up for my little quibbles. Got at a great price, too! The marketplace seller was phenominal at selling it so cheap!! One of my favorite imports (and I own hundreds) and always liked the movies, too. Glad to see more people releasing region free blu rays that we are able to enjoy here in the states.

1917875,3,B0000CABEI,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider is one hour and forty-one minutes and was released on June 11, 2001. The movie starts off with Lara doing one of her training exercising routine where she is in some ruin and battling a robot. We find out the ruin is part of her estate and that the robot is programed. One night she finds a mysterious clock in her estate secretly hidden there by her father. Bryce and Lara discovers a hidden component in the clock. They discover it is part of the Triangle of Life. This part takes a half hour to explain itselfs. After being bored for the first half hour the story takes off and the race is on between Lara Croft and Illuminati to get to Cambodia and get the first half of the triangle of  life. Lara gets the first half of the Triangle of Life, but loses the eye. Manfred Powell offers Lara a partnership which she excepts. Lara along with Bryce head off to Siberia with Powell and his party for the other half of the Triangle. Once in the temple, she finds the other half of the Triangle and Powell is unable to unite the two together orders Lara to do so. Lara unites both sides of the Triangle of Life, meets with her father, saves Alex West, kills Manfred Powell, retreives the picture he stole of her mother, destroys the Triangle of Life, and saves herself. The end. The only thing this movie had going for it were the special effects. They were great. Lara Croft video gamers will enjoy this movie much more better then your average person. Lara Croft Tomb Raider gets a C+ from me for it so-so script.

Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life is one hour and fifty seven minutes and was released on July 25, 2003. The movie starts off with a Greek wedding going on then an earthquake erupts. Next we see Lara Croft riding a speed boat and then diving underwater to find the The Cradle of Life. However, and group of mercinaries steal it from her. Next we switch back to Croft Estate where MI6 hires Lady Croft to find the Cradle of Life and stop Jonathan Reiss. Lara in turns hires Terry Sheridan who resides in a prison in Kazakhstan. Lara goes to Kazakhstan to free Terry so Terry can help her get to Chen Lo who hide out in Shanghai. Lara finds out that swap is going to be made in Hong Kong so Lara and Terry journey there. Lara retreives the Cradle of Life back and is on to Africa. Unknown to Lara, Jonathan Reiss has capture Bryce and Hillary. Once in Africa her friend there, Kosa, will act as her guide and interpreter to find Pandora's Box. Jonathan Reiss shows up with Bryce and Hillary and force Lara to show him the rest of the way. Jonathan' s men are killed by monsters, Lara kill Jonathan in the course of fight for Pandora's Box and at the end reluctantly kills Terry for the same reason. Pandora's Box is last seen submerging into a pool. This time the movie has more story but, less action and is realy no better then the first one. Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life only gets a C from me.
