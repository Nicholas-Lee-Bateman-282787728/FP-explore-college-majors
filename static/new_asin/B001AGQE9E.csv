8277347,5,B001AGQE9E,This mission training was extremely helpful for me.  No longer do I walk the streets in fear of monsters and villains.  I feel that I am now prepared to defend civillians from anything Lord Zedd throws at us.  Go Ranger!,1345593600,2,220,4.45
8277348,4,B001AGQE9E,"My mother found this DVD as at a yard sale for my son and he LOOOVES it! My son always seems to have a lot of energy and needs to run it off when I am making diner. We live next to a busy street so I don't like him playing outside alone, so instead I pop this DVD in and he burns some energy while I cook. On the DVD they have a punching bag they use for training. We don't have he same one, but I just tapped numbers too another punching bag he already had. If it wasn't so annoying for adults and a little longer it would get 5 stars.",1339632000,,536,3.710526315789474
