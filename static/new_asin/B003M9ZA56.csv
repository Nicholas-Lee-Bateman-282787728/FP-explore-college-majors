4155346,5,B003M9ZA56,"I just finished watching this movie on TVOne.  This movie was better than I thought it was going to be.  It reminds me on Trio, but better.  Good job Kenya Moore! She produced and starred in this movie. She is doing it! And you already know Boris Kodjoe is Hmm, Hmmm, good looking and acting in this movie. David Banner really should pursue a career in acting full time. He's been working out lately and it looks really good on his chocolate frame. Great movie for a couple!",1287187200,3,474,4.363636363636363

4155365,4,B003M9ZA56,Surprisingly I enjoyed watching this movie; i admit i only bought it because of David Banner but it was actually  a pretty good movie. Kenya Moore acting seems to get better as the movie goes along but she was awful in the first scene.,1415577600,,235,4.340909090909091

4155372,4,B003M9ZA56,The movie was a very good picture. In fact my first time seeing the movie was on direct tv. Starz and the movie was so good with a meanful back ground I went on line in orderd it ....... Nice picture I liked it in my husband as well,1377388800,,232,3.7551020408163267

4155375,1,B003M9ZA56,Kenya cant act. She did better on Martin and the Jamie Foxx show... She looks good on camera but should just look cute and do not talk type acting. Boris was great... I love David Banner but he could have done better too. The movie put you in the mind of a bootlegged movie. The plot sucked. My husband will watch anything but it sucked for me...,1362441600,2,346,4.17910447761194

4155377,4,B003M9ZA56,"This dvd may give Real Housewives of Atlanta fans some insight on the work of Kenya Moore, a former Miss USA, as an actor and producer.
Even though it's a ""B"" movie that I'm guessing never hit the movie screen, it's enjoyable enough to  honor credit for her efforts as a business woman.
Smitten by her delusionary persona as a newly added member of the cast from Bravo's RHOATL season five, I caught an episode where she mentions this DVD to Phaedra and Apollo as a pitch to convince them that she is worthy of being hired to produce their workout video on how to acquire a donkey booty.
There afterwards I couldn't resist making this purchase to get a glimpse of her capabilities.
Granted this movie is not Oscar material which I didn't expect, I'm pleased to add it to my DVD collection.",1358035200,,789,4.479166666666667
4155378,1,B003M9ZA56,"I was disappointed with the movie. For all these good actors, the acting sucked and so did the movie. I will be returning this movie ASAP!",1355788800,,138,4.346153846153846
4155379,5,B003M9ZA56,I am very happy with this movie I bought the price was good and it was an entertaining movie enjoyed it,1352332800,,103,3.9523809523809526
4155380,1,B003M9ZA56,This movie just wasn't that good. Boris is great to look at which kept me watching. Kenya is way prettier than she looked in the film. Some of the plot didn't make sense. Why not go to a legit pawn shop? Whey not sell the boat? Why did the housekeeper automatically pick up a knife? Just not good. There are way better low budget indi black films. Even the sexy scenes were lame. Pandora's Box and Motives 1 and 2 were better. Try those.,1342828800,4,437,4.214285714285714
4155381,5,B003M9ZA56,"This is a great movie and it totally surprised me with the actors portrayal of each character and the story line and plot. I'm a DVD movie buff and it is had to please me in the movie arena, so many poor acting movie creations and low self-esteem in actor's charactor fulfillment. I knew Boris Kodjoe could act, but, wasn't sure about the supporting actors' abilities. And this is where the surprise came in, each supporting actor, played their roles gracefully and with good acting ability and self-esteem and to my delite, the movie was one of the best out there. Compliments to the writers and videographers and Director(s). I will recommend and compliment you guys on a job well-done (5-stars).",1329955200,,698,4.776859504132231
4155382,5,B003M9ZA56,"Wow! I love myself some BORIS this man is so fine! Oh I enjoyed the movie too, will watch this over and over, all the actor's in this movie played their parts really good.  Great Job!  Love to see more of this kind of movie.",1329868800,,224,3.9555555555555557
4155383,2,B003M9ZA56,"Boris Kodjoe plays Nigel Patterson, a former FB star. During a flashback we discovered Nigel is a hood who cheats at cards, throws games, and then he killed a man. His friend Danny Jackson takes the fall for Nigel on the promise he would take care of him when he got out. Well now Jackson is out and Nigel does not come close to meeting Danny's expectations. Danny eyes Nigel's wife Eden (Kenya Moore) and as our sympathy builds for Nigel, only then he destroys it by showing us he is a thug also. The movie escalates until it becomes stupid.

The movie is low budget. It uses the same song for the soundtrack over and over again. The acting needed help as did the dialouge. If the merchandise is not stolen, you don't need to fence it to the Russian mafia. The overall idea for the script was sound, it was poorly executed on many levels.

F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1310947200,8,861,4.375
4155384,1,B003M9ZA56,"Just saw the Moor Produce, starting Kenya Moore - her acting was very bad - even the wiggs was awful. Sister really need to take acting class she was out of her class being around Boris and David Banner - weh ws powerful and with very skill acting.  Looking for more thing from David Banner, love is song. It is very nice seeing our folks, but get the right folks  - Produce by Kenya Moor, actign by Kenya Moore and it's A Moor vision media production.  This is a c move or DVD with A actor of Boris Koojjse and Richard Roundtree along with David Banner.  This ws not worh my while and a waste of my time. I thought Kenya Moore did not live up to the acting that was needed for this production.  The sets was lacking for a first class home. A very bad movie.",1301788800,2,758,4.094594594594595
4155385,4,B003M9ZA56,"Kenya Moore, again, played the role as a beautiful, rich woman who gets caught up in her husband's crap, gets sexually involved with another female, gets real near to death, then miraculously comes out on top at the end.  Boris, talented actor as well as very handsome, is absolutely perfect for this role. Now, the role of Jackson was under-developed; I expected much more fury from him; he was spoofed through and through. He handled no situation well, even from the beginning where he took the fall. I thought he had a plan, expecting 'turnabout fair play' with the maid. And the female gambler, if Jackson was behind her demise, he did everyone a favor. Guess somebody had prevail at the end.  Richard Roundtree's character was inserted to explain the other characters; had he instead narrated, the movie would have been abundantly interesting.  Two things that made me unhappy: first, the trailer told the entire movie, and, second, this underdeveloped story's ending was unbelievable. The Confidant was edgy, far from boring, the actors were gorgeous and talented, and the setting was luxurious, however, it offered a little less than expected.",1295827200,5,1150,5.042105263157895

4155388,5,B003M9ZA56,"I saw this movie twice over the weekend on channel tv-one and it was very good. It had a good cast Richard Roundtree,The very beautiful Kenya Moore, Boris Kojoe and the handsome David Banner who should definately pursue an career in acting. He was great! I noticed both Boris and Kenya acting has gotten better. I wish William L Johnson aka Brotha Bill had a much bigger role he is an very good actor and fine as hell. I give this movie 5stars and I will add it to my black movie collection.",1287446400,11,491,4.290322580645161

8400333,5,B003M9ZA56,"People hate on this woman so much so that they never admit her ""Credits"" or when something is good. Although I don't understand why in this movie they didn't feel that Boris owed his friend anything ""The movie itself was entertaining and very good"". It was so good that it's one of those movies you don't mind watching over and over again.  I hope Kenya Moore stays strong and don't deter from accomplishing great things as a Producer.  We need more minorities in these fields so that they can pain the many pictures and qualities ""WE DO POSSESS"".

8400334,2,B003M9ZA56,"This movie had the potential to be a good movie. I have nothing against the actors they all did a good job acting but the plot of the movie was wrong. The plot hooked me, I thought it was going to be a good story when I read that two guys were best friends and one of the guys took the fall for the other and was locked up. That was an unique idea and I wish there was more in this movie than the sex scene right in the beginning of the movie. In my experience when movies start with a sex scene it that means the movie is not going to be good. It was too over the top with the weird psycho drama. It was too much nakedness in the movie and not enough plot. This had the potential to be a really great movie just off the plot but I felt it didn't get there. I really liked the title and the actors were all good but there was no plot in the story to tie anything together. I really want to give it one star but the actors weren't that bad. I have to admit they had talent but I wish someone would revise this movie and make it into a good one.",1451952000,,1043,3.7889908256880735
8400335,4,B003M9ZA56,"i think this was a pretty decent movie even though you kinda already figured out where it was going within the first 30 minutes or so. But it did have the power to make one think about decision that they make and how they affect others. Kodjoe's character was quite selfish and very egotistical but he was quickly brought back to earth by his former ""friend"". I think the movie is great for an at home date night!",1446336000,,413,4.3076923076923075
