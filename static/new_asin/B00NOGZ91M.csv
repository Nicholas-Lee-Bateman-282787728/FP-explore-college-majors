6674162,4,B00NOGZ91M,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great DVD and was fun to watch. The reason for only 4 stars is that the video quality is not  DVD quality but more like an old VHS tape quality. How can this be? Most if not all of this recording source was done after 2010.",1424995200,,253,3.7735849056603774

6674164,3,B00NOGZ91M,"It's an ok show for Duck Dynasty fans. However I recommend the season 1 & season 2 sets of ""Benelli Presents Duck Commander"" over this program. It's the same show with the same scenes except it has more hunting in it. A&E took the show from Outdoor Channel, cut most of the hunting out, and added interviews to fill the time.",1415318400,22,325,4.344262295081967

6674173,4,B00NOGZ91M,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

The popularity of the Robertson family as seen through the eyes of their show DUCK DYNASTY has astounded those in the TV industry, including their home network of A&E. Where they were once thought to be just another reality show, theyve become such a phenomena that people talk about them in the news and their products in stores are selling astronomically. So where did they come from? How did their show come about?

Thats easily answered. They made duck calls and eventually produced their own series of hunting videos that they sold as well and appeared on the Outdoor Channel. The videos they shot included the homespun humor that fans have come to know over the past few years as well as their devotion to God. It was these same videos that caught the eye of A&E producers who came calling and with the help of the Robertson family turned that show into what we now have.

But what if you never saw those original programs? What if you wanted a sampling of what they had to offer back then or to see what started it all? That happened last year when during their season hiatus they began to show a new series called BEFORE THE DYNASTY. With newly shot introductions from the cast these short spots were highlighted featuring those earlier shot programs, not in their entirety but in small dosages. Those programs have been collected to form this video.

But don't think that all of these feature nothing but hunting techniques. Its much like the show we see now but perhaps just a tad bit less polished. The same as if you were watching a pilot for a show rather than the finished product. The same cast of characters are there to be found, the whole Robertson clan. And the antics fans have grown to love are all on hand as well. If you love the show, youll love this as well.

Segments include a pair of NYC firefighters who win a trip to go hunting with the Robertsons and a trip to Las Vegas for a business convention. Both those and other episodes come up with just what you would expect from this series. At just over 3 hours worth of shows this DVD offering should keep fans happy while waiting for the next season to begin or the last to arrive on disc.

The popularity of the show isn't likely to disappear soon but eventually like all other TV series the odds are it will end. Thats not something fans will be happy with. Its one of the reasons why DVDs like this are worth picking up. If you love the show and want to enjoy it forever pick up this and other seasons today.",1445904000,,2545,4.415778251599147
