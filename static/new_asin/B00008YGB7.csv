7987870,4,B00008YGB7,I found this dvd interesting. I would recommend this dvd for those who want to know the basics of how systems developed and how they are used.,1288656000,,142,4.296296296296297
7987871,5,B00008YGB7,"Great deal, quick delivery. Great DVD for the developing soccer coach. Clear explanation of the topic.",1250899200,,102,5.4375
7987872,5,B00008YGB7,Gives a great history of the game and how it has been played without getting too bogged down in detail.  The rest of the DVD is given to explaining thoroughly how different formations are used effectively and exploited as well.,1153267200,,227,4.675
7987873,2,B00008YGB7,"If you're looking for a coaching program I am afraid this will dissapoint unless you are a real biggner.

The DVD has a lot of eye candy. Cool computer graphics but lacks depth. It shows formations but fails to illustrate how to ""coach"" it on field. The section for practice games was very minimal at best. I'd say you are better off buying one of the famous coaching books, you will learn more .. a whole lot more.

A couple of books to read:Skills and Strategies for Coaching Soccer AND .. Attacking Soccer. Both will give you more detailed yet simplified coaching info than the DVD. And cost half price!",1111363200,9,606,4.5
7987874,5,B00008YGB7,"This is one of the best introductory DVDs on systems of play I have seen.  I would guess about 65% of the DVD uses 3D computer graphics to explain the basic ideas behind the modern systems of play.  The DVD uses the 10 guiding principles of modern soccer as the basis and then explains how the 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-4-3 and 3-5-2 are related to these principles.

If you have tried to learn modern systems of play by reading books and just can't get your arms around them, this is a fantastic alternative.  For example, the 4-4-2 is the most examined system, but you get to see how the system is used to attach and to defend from many angles as they rotate the computer graphics so you can see it from the attacking and defensive perspective.  This is what was so fantastic.  The DVD then uses footage from real games to show the principles being used.

The DVD does not say any system is better than the other.  If you need to really break down a single system in great deal, or are hoping to figure out how your teams 4-3-3 system will beat your crosstown rival's 3-5-2, then this is beyond the scope of the DVD, at least on the surface.  But you will learn what the purpose of the 3-5-2 is and how your system is similar and different.

The final segment of the DVD shows how to use a practice to begin to teach systems of play.  Its not expansive, but good enough to get you started.  The DVD also goes over what a coach must consider when determining what system of play to use for the types of players they have.",1099008000,5,1512,4.266666666666667
