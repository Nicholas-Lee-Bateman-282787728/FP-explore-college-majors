Joy et Joan (1985) Brigitte Lahaie is Joy, she's a well traveled woman who's on holiday in Indonesia. She travels all around southeast Asia looking for excitement and pleasure (Indonesia, Indochina and The Philippines). Along the way she meets a young, short haired curvy brunette named Joan. The two strike up a friendship along their way back to France. What happens next? Well that would be all too telling. Pseudo sequel (in name only) to the Joy series.

Sadly, this movie is next to impossible to find. Unless you, live in a place like Europe or Japan. The U.S. has no respect for film of this caliber. The film industry is obsessed with bleached blonds with fake parts of the female anatomy.

Highly recommended Euro-trash.

A++++

By all means seek this one out, you won't regret it!",1184803200,2,860,4.783783783783784
