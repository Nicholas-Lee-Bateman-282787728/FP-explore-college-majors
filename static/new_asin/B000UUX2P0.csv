It has great routines for calming down and waking up, and just watching this beautiful DVD relaxes me.  The lecture with the Dalai Lama is wonderful and inspirational.

The DVD is truly a gem and I look forward to using it for a long time.",1191542400,39,328,3.8656716417910446

2925450,5,B000UUX2P0,"I bought this DVD several years ago and hadn't used it in a while. Hadn't done any yoga, and have been very inconsistent in any fitness endeavor. I picked this dvd out this morning for some much-needed movement. I loved it. There are a lot of combinations and different times for practices, from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Barbara Benagh's instructions are clear and she provides adjustments for those of us who aren't that flexible. She is also very soothing. I felt much better after doing one of the practices on this DVD. I will be using it more often as I get back into shape!",1426550400,11,580,4.481132075471698

2925454,1,B000UUX2P0,"I've only done two of the routines so far but have not been impressed. I have done the 25- and 30-minute PM routines.
The 30-minute routine is choppy and does not have a good flow if you want to relax...every other stretch is standing up while the others are sitting or lying down. The constant up and down was frustrating to me.
The 20-minute routine is choppy as well and after doing child's pose it never instructs you to switch to your back for the breathing exercises...so if you're just listening to cues because you're lying on the floor and can't see the television, you're left in child's pose trying to do deep breathing for quite some time, which, let me tell you, adds to your pain, instead of helping it. There's also a part where you are supposed to have your feet up against the wall, then you're told to sit up. The next thing you know, you're being told to get back onto your back for shavasana/savasana.
Again...not a good flow.

There is no indication before each routine if you will need a blanket (or 2 or 3)...which would also be helpful.

I want to believe this is a good dvd, but I just feel so disappointed so far and wish I had gone with another dvd. I like my yoga practices to be smooth and well cued. These aren't.",1421107200,3,1243,4.353448275862069

I switched the routines sometimes. It's not bad, really. Just nothing special. It is appropriate for beginners and intermediates.  I don't know about advanced people, since I'm not advanced. I do yoga just occasionally.  I don't recommend spending full price on this disk, but if you can get it on sale, it is a good basic set of poses and will add variety to your other DVDs.",1420243200,,544,4.484848484848484

The sea wave background is appropriate and energetic.  In this video, she aims every exercise program to a limit of 45 minutes.  The average one is 30 minutes.  Beginners under her yoga guideline sure benefit a lot.  There is no lifting weights involved.  A mattress and folding blankets are needed by the way.
The introduction by a Buddha can be skipped for good.  I don't give him any credit.  Barbara's yoga is just great.  Buy this video.",1411430400,,577,4.855670103092783
2925462,5,B000UUX2P0,I absolutely love this dvd! Ms. Benagh is a great instructor. Every clear and precise instructions. I loved this dvd so much I bought 2 of her other dvds. I'm new to yoga so the thoughtfulness of her saying go at your own pace and take your time to learn the breathing and proper alignment was so refreshing. I bought another instructors dvd and was so disappointed but this one is spot on! I definitely recommend Ms. Benagh's series to all beginners. Thank you Ms. Benagh!,1403913600,4,473,4.511627906976744
2925463,5,B000UUX2P0,I am on the heavier side and found this workout reasonable for a beginner. Some positions are a bit tricky--however I'm sure I will improve over time.

2925464,2,B000UUX2P0,"I've been doing yoga (on and off) for over 20 years. In spite of having my own routine that I usually go back to, it's nice now and then to change things up a bit and try out a new DVD or class.

I tried AM/PM yoga a couple of times, as I wanted to give it a fair trial before writing a review.

 Can't say that I was impressed by this DVD. I found the poses lacked the ""flow"" that is so important in making a yoga routine not just effective, but relaxing and calming too. I like yoga routines where all or most of the poses standing up are done first, followed by the floor work. It seemed like I was getting up and down, over and over in this routine, to do the next pose. Far from relaxing, just annoying.

I have found a yoga DVD series that I really am enjoying: ""Larry Payne's Prime of Life Yoga"". These include DVDs for beginners, more advanced, even one for those with back problems. And yes, in these routines, there is a flow from one pose to the other. This is a series that I do come back to again and again.

As for the AM/PM Yoga for Beginners DVD, it's headed for the free box at our local library. I know I won't be using it anymore myself.",1387411200,4,1156,4.008695652173913
2925465,4,B000UUX2P0,"I have not watched or done the whole thing, but the one we did (25 minute PM) was good. Enough to unwind and relax, not too easy.

2925472,5,B000UUX2P0,"This DVD has proven to be a life saver for me.  Ms. Benaugh is an extremely patient and gentle instructor as she issue verbal instructions along with nice visuals in a wonderfully smoothing voice.  I like the ability to select from a wide variety of yoga practices depending on time available and other factors. They are several progams for mornings and evenings. It is as simple as selecting a yoga exercise routine depending on time available. You have only ten minutes, or twenty, perhaps thirty or even forty-five minutes for a session? There are multiple routines that can fit perfectly into your schedule.

Not only has my energy level risen in a dramatic way, by sense of well being, and a big time drop in my stress level are all benefits realized from the use of this DVD.  I did not realized how tense and in ""knots"" my body was until I started using this program.  This is something mature and especially seniors can do without causing bodily injury.  There is nothing to be afraid of if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD. It is safe. And, there are no positions that would require you to ""stand on your head"". Think gentle, effective, and challening at the same time when you consider this DVD.

I purchased my copy mid-December 2012 and already I am singing its praises.",1359244800,7,1289,4.62719298245614

2925475,5,B000UUX2P0,"this is a great product, I find Barbara a very great communicator and presenter as well as an Yoga expert.
I practice 2 or 3 of the routines 4 to 5 times a week in the mornings before work. Since I do not have a lot of time I used the 15 minute Yoga workout and then do some resistance exercises. The product is great and recommend it to someone that is serious about their health and will use it consistently",1346889600,,409,4.061728395061729
2925476,4,B000UUX2P0,"I like that there are 8 different series you can do from standing poses, stretching, and relaxation. However I don't like how some of the segments are very choppy when it goes from pose to pose. It's a little wierd and doesn't flow seemlessy like it should. Barbara benagh I find to have a very soothing voice though. But I also bought her yoga for beginners video an found these two were pretty much identical but this am/pm one has more segments to choose from.",1345593600,2,463,4.458823529411765

I use all three alot and really enjoy them, plus there are still many others to work with.  Nice range of times also for the workouts so it is easy to pick and choose.",1328227200,,430,4.047058823529412
2925479,4,B000UUX2P0,"A nicely long video. Such gorgeous, soothing setting, colors, music and voice. However, the instructor encourages a bit of push/strain, so do be wary, if a true beginner. More than this, while so well done, there are some segments, in which there is no flow between poses at all. I would appreciate even if all seated poses were loosely grouped together and standing poses likewise. Instead, for a p.m. relaxation practice, one is up-down, up-down, the whole practice long. It breaks up the flow & hinders the relaxation. Nevertheless, this one still occupies a spot on my well-edited shelf of yoga workout videos.",1327622400,2,614,4.970873786407767
2925480,5,B000UUX2P0,"I really enjoy the pm part of this DVD. I have a hard time calming my body in the evening when it's time to go to bed and I hate taking pills to sleep. Since using this DVD, my restless nights are minimal. I haven't really usd the am part because I'm catching up on my sleep but if it's anything like the pm I'm sure it's great. This poses in the pm are easy, the instruction is clear and calming and the video quality is great.",1323302400,3,428,3.9310344827586206
2925481,5,B000UUX2P0,Received product promptly.  Brand new in original packaging as stated.  The DVD is in various 15 and 30 minute segments.  Some may be longer.  This is good because sometimes I'm pressed for time.  I've used the DVD several times now and I am pleased!,1314835200,,250,4.590909090909091
2925482,2,B000UUX2P0,"I really don't like this DVD very much. They have select poses and stretches that they just cut and edit to and put together making the ""10 + routines""  The cutting and editing doesn't make for good flowing routines. They don't prep saying ""This is what you'll need during this routine"" so you're grabbing things, getting out of the position quickly, etc... Also, You're laying down, they you have to stand up quickly to get to the next pose which puts a lot of strain on your body. The cutting and editing doesn't help you to know what is coming next. I would much rather have a boring dvd with 1 morning routine and 1 night routine where you see the instructor the whole time doing what your doing and it actually flows and you get to the next position in the least straining way possible. Versus the up, down, up, down, up, down of this one!",1311811200,6,844,4.375796178343949
2925483,4,B000UUX2P0,This is a very good DVD for both beginners and older yoga folks.  The poses are explained in detail so that the beginner can figure out how to get into the postion.  The poses are held for maximun effectiveness.  The exercises are very good and they have found a way to skip into the different series to make the routine longer or shorter depending on how much time you have.  DeeDee Liston,1309392000,,390,4.375
2925484,1,B000UUX2P0,"There is absolutely no flow to changing poses.. it will have you up then down then up..  each pose is basically a scene change.  Maybe the only benefit it has was the breathing exercises, other than that, it's not worth the money.",1308787200,2,230,4.4523809523809526
2925485,5,B000UUX2P0,"A nice selection of workouts that are generally designed for the morning or evening, though you can also mix them like Dr Beth said.  I also squeeze some of the shorter workouts in when I get a chance, really does help make me feel good, even if it is only a 10 or 15 minute exercise.  I really like Barbara, great teacher.",1307318400,,323,4.193548387096774
2925486,4,B000UUX2P0,"I purchased this dvd so I could get back to doing yoga after three years away. I didn't practice regularly even then, but I was certainly more flexible. Well, this dvd has increased my flexibility. The PM section really helps me to get a good nights rest and relax my strained muscles after AM kick boxing. I did not give it five stars because there is a PM portion that has you sitting then standing, then sitting and standing yet again. There seems to be no flow there. There is a lot of breathe work which is great for relaxation, however, I am now ready to do more positions. Overall this is a good dvd and will purchase the next one which I hope will be more challenging.",1306972800,,676,4.2890625

I'm in nursing school, so this helps with stress as well. I love that the sessions can be short (15 mins.) or longer. There are various amounts of time to choose from, as well as the morning and night versions. I really can't say enough good things about this! The instructor must remember how it was when she first started because it's like she's reading my mind when something  gets more difficult and she gives alternative ways of doing things. I also loved listening to the Dalai Lama. I think this CD would be great for beginners and advanced students alike. It's just beautiful!!!",1303862400,2,764,4.536231884057971
2925488,5,B000UUX2P0,"I've really enjoyed this DVD. It gives you several choices in each of the AM and PM sections, with different focuses [breathing, spine, relaxation, etc] and ---my favorite part---for different lengths of time [10, 25, 25,30, 35, or 45 min]. On the weekend I have time to choose one of the longer segments, but sometimes during the week I'm a little pressed for time so I just go with a 10 or 15-minute one. I'd love to have time every day to do 30-45 minutes of yoga but we all know things get a little busy! At least with the choices I can do at least a bit of good stretching.
I really love the ""wake up the spine"" from the AM side. Feels great!!

2925490,5,B000UUX2P0,I have been working with videos now for about a year and a half and started using this one for routines to add to the morning and evening. With the range of options in terms of time (shorter to longer) this has been a very good addition.,1300924800,,237,4.0638297872340425
2925491,5,B000UUX2P0,I have been looking for a decent Yoga DVD that I can use in the morning and at night. This is the best DVD I have found. Easy yet challenging poses and very relaxing. It helps me to wake up refreshed rather than grumpy and dragging my feet. And it helps me to fall asleep fast when it usually takes me hours of restless sleep to get there.,1297468800,,339,4.0
2925492,5,B000UUX2P0,"I have always had an immense interest in trying Yoga. Yet I've always been intimidated because often instructors make it seem near impossible to achieve the level of flexibility and strength endurance that they have (seeing as they've been doing it for many years). I remember wondering in class (when they did impossible poses) if they were just naturally flexible because there was no way in hell my body could ever possibly bend like they were showing. I became rather discouraged with it all and I stopped attending that particular class.
  I was browsing on Amazon for different exercise DVDs and came across this one and saw the starred reviews. I have to say I was I bit hesitant to try just for the simple fact that what some people consider easy, I consider hard and even though I run a lot, I am not that flexible. When my DVD arrived, I popped it in and selected the morning (AM) option. There was a list of options to choose from and since I had the time, I chose a 45 minute one. All I can say is yes, it's a bit challenging. HOWEVER!!! If you are a beginner, then it IS the right level for you! And the instructor on the DVD is great because she allows variations to be done and encourages you to not hurt yourself or strain yourself. She is constantly reminding viewers that yoga is not a race nor a competition and that really helps during the exercise (for me at least since I have always been in a rush).
  Another thing I like about the DVD is that it's not one of those annoying exercise DVDs where the instructor is exercising and talking and is constantly running out of breath simultaneously. This DVD has her do a voice over of her poses so her tone is always calm and she's doing everything in the demonstrations the way you're supposed to. There is also relaxing ocean waves in the background and meditation music playing. After only a few days use, I can already see my body improving with flexibility and also I am gaining a better since of control over my mental state (ie if I'm stressed, bummed out, etc).
  Best part is, for the longest time, I've had lower back pains. I even bought a new bed to try to alleviate some of the pain (which did not work). Great news: Yoga helped TREMENDOUSLY with my lower back pain. Even when taking Ibuprofen wouldn't help, yoga has damn near eliminated all of my lower back pain! It's amazing. I say if you're intimidated by the thought of yoga, or you've had a bad experience with it, try this DVD. The lady in it is sincerely nice and she seems really knowledgeable on Yoga and what she demonstrates.",1295568000,12,2568,4.430084745762712

I wanted something that would give me morning and evening routines so this seemed like the perfect choice.  Routines are 10-45 minutes so I can always fit one in, even on really busy days.  I think you could use this DVD if you're new to yoga, and if you have experience it's a good guided workout and I think you'll like it and find it worthwhile.

Much like how it helped with my aches, the yoga on this DVD really helps me feel better to start and end the day.  There are a couple of shorter routines that I like to try to do a couple of times a week in the morning and a couple of shorter ones for the night.

I was convinced to give this DVD a try by all the positive reviews and I am so glad I did. Barbara Benagh's instruction is excellent! She tells you what to do before she actually does it, and she provides multiple options for modifying the poses to fit your level of flexibility. Best of all, she coaches you on how you should be breathing throughout the workout. After one workout, I finally feel like I ""get"" yoga.",1289001600,5,655,4.559322033898305

It's still new to me and I do feel my muscles working, but it's not like a gym workout. It's more like I'm aware of how my muscles and joints should be working, if that makes any sense.

I've mostly been working on the ""PM"" routines because that's when I have time and I wanted to do yoga to unwind and relax. One thing I really like about this program is how many different routines it has and that they are different lengths and for different things. That helps a lot. I can find something for how I feel that day and for how much time I have or want to spend doing it.

On the negative side, this DVD is really hard to follow. The audio track is dubbed in, and feels disconnected from the actual yoga practice. Also, the narration doesn't describe all the key parts of the pose, so it's very hard to follow without looking at the TV. I suppose you could watch and memorize the routines before hand, but If I have some free time, I'd rather do yoga.

The other downside is that the practices are pretty disjointed. It seems like they are assembled from several different practices. Frequently, at the end of one pose, the camera will cut to a scene of the beach and then cut back to the instructor, who is in an entirely different pose. This wipes out any sense of flow as well as meaning that you have scramble to get into the next starting pose.

All in all, it's a great idea, but poorly put together.",1272412800,4,1106,4.333333333333333

The scenery is pretty and relaxing (it's beachside) and there are enough short sessions you can do that it makes a good quick morning or evening routine. Overall grade is a B-.",1269129600,8,559,4.646464646464646

2925511,3,B000UUX2P0,"I went to my first yoga class while visiting NYC and enjoyed it so much that the very same day I ordered this video and Yoga For Beginners, bought a yoga belt and mat.  I live in an isolated area with no access to classes or other practicers and based on reviews and ""Beginner"" in the titles, I thought this would be the best for me.  The class I went to in NYC was intense, I was sweating by the end and felt incredible for the rest of the day and a similar glow stayed with me for several days.  I've done this video more than once and thought it was kind of boring and not challenging.  Some of the descriptions could have been better and the quality of the video as a teaching tool is low.  Sometimes there are shadows when she's on the floor and it's difficult to see if she's lifting herself up, a lot of transitions are bad - suddenly she's in a new pose and most importantly: there should be multiple shots and multiple frames at once so you can see what the teacher is doing from multiple angles - this way you know what you're doing is correct.  When I first started to do this video, there was a lot of stopping and going, since I'm new to it and I wanted to get the basics right.  At the same time, I was looking for something that was at least a little physically challenging - like the class I went to in NYC and this was not challenging... but it WAS comforting to my body (and maybe Barbara's constant patient comments and alternatives if you aren't flexible has me thinking I'm much better than I am).  I DID enjoy this video and wouldn't return it, I think it's a valuable assess to a beginners collection, however if I'd been able to rent it first, then I would've gone with something else to purchase.  So now I've ordered Yoga Shakta and Shiva Rea: Daily Energy, which I'm hoping will be more challenging.",1267401600,6,1826,4.239193083573487

I am trying to keep my breathing even, in good position (neither of which they remind you of or explain how to do very well) and thinking I missed something start the position without knowing exactly what I am doing.
This is my own fault... I should have read the information better. I thought there would be more of a quick 10 min. yoga routine for morning and night for the busy person. I have 3 16 hour days in the week, and 2 8-10 hour days I do not have time to spend 25-45 minutes on yoga in the morning and again at night. I was hoping for a quick, basic, yoga routine that hit the major muscle groups in around 10 minutes. The 10 minute routine for night was based on breathing and did not have a lot of actual yoga involved in it.
This may be a good DVD for someone who has an inkling of what they are doing, but for true beginners it is lacking. I would not recommend this to a friend.",1267315200,7,1038,4.068292682926829

I love that there are different time options. There are some days when I need to be out the door quickly, and some of the 10 or 15 minutes workouts are perfect. Other days I can afford more time and do 25 or 30 minute programs and it's wonderful. The instructor paces it well (a little slow, but you stay in the poses longer and get a deeper stretch), and her voice is so soothing. Perfect for melting away stress and tension. I find the poses challenging but not impossible. I also tried the Rodney Yee AM Yoga DVD and like this one infinitely better.

You should keep a few blankets, a chair, and possibly a strap nearby when doing the longer routines so that you don't have to go searching for them when you need to use them.

We love this dvd and the options to choose whatever length of workout you can fit in.  My husband (who hates anything that's not weight-lifting related and is very inflexible) actually looks forward to this dvd every night.

If you are looking for a good workout dvd and/or are pretty familiar with yoga, this is not the dvd for you.  It's very basic and slow and would probably bore you.  That's not knocking the dvd though - it is for inflexible people, people new to yoga, and people looking to relieve stress and anxiety.  In that aspect, the dvd is great.

2925546,5,B000UUX2P0,"Pro:
- cheap way to try yoga (much cheaper that classes). You just need the DVD, a mat (I bought it at a sport store for 25$), 2-3 pillows or blanckets.
- 10 routines; 15 minutes the shortests, 45 minutes the longest, you don't need to spent 2 hours as you have to when you take a class outside.
- No pre-scheduled classes. You can do it any time of the day. At your own pace (I do it when I wake up in the morning)

- Benefits:
If you do it after you wake up in the morning, you just start the day in a more ""positive"" state of mind.
You can feel your back posture improves. You will naturally put more attention on your posture day time.
You feel a more flexible body, less sense of ""heavy legs"" or ""thight muscles"" or similar.
My lower back pain I had before starting yoga, is gone. (I work in front of a computer 8 hours or more a day...)

Cons:
- yeah, sometimes the ""voice"" talks too much but... remember, is a beginner DVD: better too many words (explaining what you are doing, how to do it, words of caution...) then too few words
- A real good teacher corrects your mistakes better during the exercises

How I use it:
In the morning I run the ""wake up the spine"" routine (35 mins) or ""get up and go"" (15 minutes), depending how much time I have. Almost every day.
In the evening:
Mainly the ""Good night sleep"", rarely the ""unwind muscles tension"". (both around 20 mins). Every other evening(more or less).

Yes, it will be the first thing I'll suggest to someone that tells me... ""I have some back pain bothering me""",1226793600,10,1525,4.212328767123288
2925547,5,B000UUX2P0,"I like the selections of material on this DVD for doing yoga in the morning and evening and once again Barbara provides great instruction and her experience shows as she reminds you how to do the poses properly in an none obtrusive manner

Because there are plenty of short segments to choose from AND it's not just a work out it can be spiritualy moving as well.

2925550,5,B000UUX2P0,"I purchased this and Yoga Beginners earlier this year and it was a very worthwhile purchase.  This DVD has alot of routines:

AM Routines

 Get Up and Go
 Sun Salutation Centering
 Breath Work
 Gentle Wake Up
 Extended Morning
 Wake Up the Spine

PM Routines

 Short Rest
 Breath Work
 Unwinding Muscle Tension
 Good Nights Sleep
 Energizing Evening

The AM routines are more ""energetic"" while the PM routines tend towards more relaxation, as one would expect, though I will use routines at different times during the day, the Short Rest is great for when I need a break.

Barbara is a great teacher and between the DVDs I have gotten I am progressing in my yoga practice.",1219881600,,672,4.695652173913044
2925551,5,B000UUX2P0,"I love this yoga DVD! I've been practicing yoga for about 5 years, but I'm too busy now for classes. I needed a DVD that I could use to practice along to at home.

The narration in the DVD is very helpful and the instructor's voice is soothing. I like that the poses are taught Iyengar-style, with props and blocks, since that's how I normally practice. The ability to choose between AM and PM routines is great. The only thing missing is that ability to customize your routines, but I feel that the ones put together for you are quite good.",1219363200,,541,4.356435643564357
2925552,5,B000UUX2P0,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my husband and wasn't sure how he would take to it, but he actually loves it. He has been using it daily for several weeks now and says it's been a great way to start the day.
It is very well organized and gives you many choices (10 routines at 15 minutes each).
The instructor's voice is very pleasant, and the setting is relaxing (at the beach, you can hear the waves in the background).
Great for beginners & intermediate!",1215648000,3,457,4.204545454545454
2925553,4,B000UUX2P0,"This is a good DVD.  The practices/movements are very relaxing.  Instruction is at a good pace.  I look forward to my twice a week yoga sessions.  My only complaint is that there is way too much talking at the beginning of the DVD.  I recommend this for beginners and intermediate users who like a full range of motions in a relaxing, less intense setting.",1214956800,5,356,4.5
2925554,5,B000UUX2P0,"This DVD is a wonderful DVD with a great selection of practices on it for both the morning and the evening.

Barbara's voice relaxes me and she offers great guidance and instruction on how to get the most out of the poses.  The music is balanced well with the waves and and this helps with relaxtion.  I try to do something from this DVD at least every other day and having the shorter routines have helped me accomplish this no matter how busy I get.

Highly recommended.",1212278400,3,472,4.390804597701149
2925555,2,B000UUX2P0,I'm not a big fan of this DVD!  It is very broken up and doesn't have a good flow to it at all.  The music stops with each position change.  I've also never heard anyone talk all the way through savasana - it's supposed to be the relaxation/meditation pose.  I find it really annoying on this DVD.,1211328000,14,297,4.157894736842105
2925556,5,B000UUX2P0,"I'm very happy with this yoga program.  The instruction is good, and the instructors voice is very calm and soothing.  It's filmed on a beach and that also adds to it.  There's about a dozen routines and it's broken up into a morning section and evening section and both have routines of different lengths.  I think it would be good for anyone, not just for beginners.",1211241600,5,368,4.53030303030303
2925557,5,B000UUX2P0,"I've been using the ""am"" section of this DVD and these routines have been a really nice way to start my day.  They range from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, so even on a busy weekday I've been able to fit one in.  For really busy mornings, the 15-minute ""get up and go"" or ""sun salutation"" have been perfect.  On weekends I like to do the 45 minute ""extended wake-up.""",1209945600,6,363,4.1571428571428575
2925558,5,B000UUX2P0,"Another great DVD with Benagh.  I have the one for stress relief.  This is she speaks at a little faster pace, which is nice since I'm a bit impatient.  I've done yoga for almost 10 years but stopped for a while because of wrist injuries.  This is gentle but also very effective.",1207872000,7,279,4.3076923076923075

2925561,5,B000UUX2P0,"This is a wonderfully multifaceted video that allows choices and variety. If you only have 15 minutes, choose that section.  You can do this on your own once you know the postures, but it is more rewarding when you have a teacher, even if it is on video.  The postures tend to be on the relaxing side, but done regularly will enhance strength and flexibility.  If you get really inspired, watch several sections and you can do a couple of hours.  I have several yoga videos, but I tend to grab this one because of the variety of possibilities.",1203897600,9,543,4.454545454545454
2925562,5,B000UUX2P0,"I purchased AM/PM Yoga for Beginners after Christmas and have found it to be almost unbelievably wonderful. I am not an exercise girl, but I'm getting up early in the mornings so I'll have time for a routine before heading off to work. I'm a high school librarian so I can have 10 kids needing something, printers not printing, computers not cooperating, etc., etc., etc. all at once. I'm stepping back, taking some calming breaths, relaxing my stomach and body, and quietly lining things up to be done in order, thanks to these gentle routines.  Barbara Benagh's voice is relaxing and calming. I like the soft melodies in the background and  practicing yoga does not feel rushed or stressful. No ""no pain, no gain"" sentiments here. I highly recommend this soothing form of exercise and this DVD.",1203120000,19,796,4.802919708029197
2925563,5,B000UUX2P0,"Excellent DVD for a beginner like me.  I started with Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies to learn in greater detail positioning of 12 poses (and good yoga information), and moved on to Benagh's Beginning Yoga DVD, which is especially good for learning deeply the Sun Salutation.  Then, I graduated to this DVD.  Love the music that has been added to the already healing sound of the waves.  Great routines that vary in length, allowing me to choose which will fit into my sometimes hectic days.  Her verbal guidance and cues are helpful and supportive throughout. Her yoga poses are also an inspiration.  Highly recommend.",1202515200,17,618,4.894230769230769
2925564,4,B000UUX2P0,This DVD could have been near perfect for what it is - AM & PM with a variety of choices on length and focus of practice - however some of the sequences have you performing a standing pose one moment and a sitting pose in the next and then a standing pose in the next after that.  A lot of getting up and down which becomes a little irritating to me.  I love the background of the ocean and gentle music and the pace is wonderful - Barbara Benagh obviously knows what she's doing.,1201910400,14,480,4.095744680851064

The routines range from about 15 minutes to 45 minutes so there is a routine to do even if you oversleep in the morning or get home late from work and still want to do some yoga.

Barbara's instruction is once again perfect in her pacing and her tone and shows why she is so well reknowned in the yoga world.  I am hoping to attend one of her Yoga retreats she holds every year in Jamaica, though I will not be able to attend next month.",1201392000,3,623,3.8897637795275593

The instruction is great, the scenary beautiful and it helps me rest in the evenings.

I let a friend borrow this who had not really done alot of yoga before and they were rather pleasently suprised when the PM routines helped them unwind for the day and get a good night's rest.

So if you are looking for something to help you start or end your day nicely, this one is a must have.",1200182400,5,494,4.290322580645161

I have tried sleeping pills, but I don't like the side effects. This DVD has helped me get a good night sleep again. It's so simple but effective. I only wish I tried this years ago and I could get all those hours of sleep back. I have begun doing the morning workouts as well and my overall calm during the day has been greatly enhanced. I am giving this DVD to several people for X-mas!",1197417600,79,545,4.102803738317757
2925569,5,B000UUX2P0,"This DVD is wonderful with a wide range of routines designed for the morning and evening.

Even with a busy schedule I am finding myself using this DVD at least every other day and have try to do at least one of the shorter practices once a day.  On good days I manage to get a morning and night workout in and feel the difference.

If you are short on time I would suggest figuring out which is more of an issue, waking up or sleeping and target that to start because the DVD helps get you started or sleep properly and either one does make the day better.

There are 6 AM Routines - Get Up and Go, Sun Salutation Centering, Breath Work, Gentle Wake Up, Extended Morning, Wake Up the Spine, with range from 15 minutes to 45 minutes or so and 5 PM Routines, Short Rest, Breath Work, Unwinding Muscle Tension, Good Nights Sleep and Energizing Evening which range from 10 to 40 minutes.  The routines cover more relaxing (less active) workouts and others that are more active.  There is something for everything and everyone and the beach is stunning.

2925570,5,B000UUX2P0,"This DVD by renowned yoga instructor Barbara Benagh is similar in format to her previous DVD, Yoga for Stress Relief.  However, whereas the latter offers practices for different conditions (back pain, headaches, digestive issues, etc.), in the AM/PM DVD, Barbara offers practices designed for morning or evening.  These practices, which are slow-moving and quite gentle overall, range in length from 15 to 45 minutes, making it easy to fit yoga into even your busiest days. Barbara frequently uses props: in addition to a yoga mat, I would recommend that you have at least one blanket on hand (preferably 2-3), with pillows and an eye bag being optional.

A breakdown of the DVD is listed below. The headings are the items found on the main menu, and the bullets indicate submenu items (the times for each practice are given as they appear on-screen).  I've included brief notes describing each of the practices.

Discussion of Meditation by HH The Dalai Lama

AM Routines
*Get Up and Go (15m)--a wonderful flow of upper back openers, including down dog, quarter dog, and cobra
*Sun Salutation Centering (15m)--a single slow lunge salutation combined with seated forward bends
*Breath Work (30m)--a gentle, all-lying/seated practice that includes twists, supported poses, and seated meditation; my favorite!
*Gentle Wake Up (35m)--consists almost entirely of reclined postures plus two seated twists; would be a nice evening practice
*Extended Morning (45m)--a more active practice that begins on the floor but then moves to standing for side stretch, tree, triangle, side angle, and warrior 1; returns to the floor for relaxing poses
*Wake Up the Spine (35m)--begins with the above sun salutation, moves through the same standing series as Ext Morning, and finishes on the floor with reclined poses, seated forward bends, and twists

PM Routines
*Short Rest (10m)--this brief practice offers a reclined twist, pursed lip breathing, and legs-up-the-wall pose
*Breath Work (20m)--starts with a shoulder stretch and seated twist, then moves on to seated meditation, breath work, and savasana
*Unwinding Muscle Tension (30m)--this nice practice features a variety of twisting postures in reclined, seated, and standing positions
*Good Nights Sleep (25m)--another simple practice with crocodile pose, pursed lip breathing, seated meditation, and reclined postures
*Energizing Evening (40m)--this more active practice opens with the above sun salutation followed by a wide-legged standing hamstring twist, then alternates between seated poses (half lord of the fishes, open half lotus) and reclined postures (reclined leg stretch, modified bridge, reclined twist), finishing with legs-up-the-wall

Credits

As in her previous videos, Barbara is practicing alone against the backdrop of a beautiful beach at Half Moon Bay Resort in Antigua.  This DVD does feature some of the same posture sequences as in Barbara's prior Yoga for Stress Relief, but the footage appears to be new.  Also, because all of the programs are generally gentle and relaxing, I find the AM vs. PM practices fairly interchangeable for day or night.  Overall, this is an excellent yoga DVD well-suited to a wide range of practitioners, from those fairly new to yoga to more experienced yoginis like myself--definitely recommended.",1194480000,285,3296,5.453831041257367
2925571,5,B000UUX2P0,"I've bought many fitness and yoga DVDs and I find that this is the one that I use the most often because it is really effective.

The AM section really helps when I've got a stiff back or just at stretching me out and getting me ready for the day.

The PM has been really helpful in getting me ready for a very good sleep and unwind at the end of the day.

This is a very useful DVD. It's accessible for beginners and also beneficial for people that have done yoga for some time. Great for anyone looking for focused, effective and easy to follow routines.",1194220800,56,556,4.177570093457944

2925573,5,B000UUX2P0,I really appreciate this DVD. I have 2 kids and a full-time job. At the end of the evening I really need to decompress and this DVD helps a lot.

2925574,5,B000UUX2P0,"I have always liked bodywisdom media DVDs since they have so much content, but this one might be my favorite.
