8305122,1,B001GEFBA8,"This could have been a great video, as they obviously know the subject well.  But they put no effort into it's production.  It is not worth a tenth of it's cost.  Highly promoted with nothing to show for it.  The entire sequence of ONLY ONE EXAMPLE SHOWN is only a few seconds long, although they do repeat it several times, just to extend the run time.  They make no effort to explain what you just saw, if you don't blink.  This is WAY OVER PRICED, JUST TO GET YOUR MONEY!  I will not buy anything else from these people!",1380585600,,523,4.222222222222222
8305123,3,B001GEFBA8,"This is relatively good material, as all other Krav Maga videos which give you some foundation on defense. However, I was disappointed  that Nardia was not really providing the verbal or physical demonstration.",1353801600,,210,5.363636363636363
8305124,5,B001GEFBA8,"This is one of the best disarm handgun defense besides ""Gun Disarming Tactics"" I find to be the real deal in true disarming defense. I recommend it!",1353024000,,148,4.518518518518518
8305125,5,B001GEFBA8,"I would like to recommend this good DVD to
anyone who want to learn about real self defense.
This DVD is about the Gun Disarming principles
and concepts of the Kapap system.
