4306955,5,B004AC6PW6,Perfect level for me.  Instructions are clear and easy to follow.,1411689600,,65,4.909090909090909
4306956,2,B004AC6PW6,"At first, I enjoyed this video and the combination of exercises.  However, my attention quickly became diverted by one of Sue Grant's backup persons who was constantly smirking, grimacing, or doing her own thing to the music.  Eventually, I could not stand to watch the video anymore.  I feel that in order for an exercise video to be successful, trainers need to be very professional with few distractions mixed in.  Otherwise, their viewers will quickly tire of their videos.",1402012800,3,477,5.0
4306957,5,B004AC6PW6,"This dvd was just what I was looking for.  Something that I could actually do.  Now I can exercise at home without wasting money on a gym that I never went to but had to pay for.  I like that fact that it is broken down into segments like warm up, aerobics, strengthening with weights, etc.",1380672000,7,290,4.142857142857143
4306958,5,B004AC6PW6,Sue Grant is one of the best she is not too chatty and gives a good sensible workout for any age.,1369785600,2,97,3.6666666666666665
4306959,2,B004AC6PW6,Vee walks are hard on hips a lot of arm movements.  Weight training should be done on a chair.  Stretches should be standing.,1360713600,,125,4.391304347826087
4306960,4,B004AC6PW6,Nice work out with different approaches. Can be broken down to do less or more. Would recommend it to others.,1357948800,2,109,4.5
4306961,5,B004AC6PW6,"Two great things happened for me this past year.

First, I discovered the books Seasoned Romance, Dr. Ruth's Sex at 50, and Grandpa Does Grandma, each of which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex and romance. One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.

Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including Older & Wiser Workout and the Older & Much Wiser Workout, both by Sue Grant. These two I mentioned are both for seniors, but they take you from beginning to more advanced. Now, since I've gotten Fit at Any Age, I'm even more impressed with this long-term program and the different fitness levels you can reach.

More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.

Thanks, Sue Grant, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",1312243200,9,1132,4.78974358974359

8419945,5,B004AC6PW6,I really like this workout video.  I have others of hers so knew she would not let me down.  I had a serious knee injury a few years back and this strength and stretching portion are really doing the trick.  Just like going to therapy but cheaper.  I hope she continues to put others out as I will buy those too.,1490054400,,312,4.065573770491803

8419948,4,B004AC6PW6,"good work out, will take a while before it becomes to easy.",1480982400,,59,4.0
8419949,5,B004AC6PW6,"As a 62 year old woman who used to be obsessed with working out but have been out of the habit for the past few years, I was pleasantly surprised by the gentle intensity of this exercise routine. I was concerned it would be too easy but it seems just right.  It starts with a good warm up, progresses to low impact aerobic routine that is fun and a little silly with Sue Grants voice urging us on.  Next is an easy weight lifting routine and finally a good cool down session.  I had previously been doing a different exercise DVD, one geared towards 20-30 year olds.  It was fun but hard and I was always sore and my joints were suffering.  Sue Grant encourages us to do the best we can, as she says, ""You don't need to touch your forehead to your knees, just stretching is what we want"" or words to that effect.  She looks great, and the ladies behind her do different versions of the same exercises.  I recommend this Fit at Any Age routine.  It got my heart rate up without damaging my joints!",1480723200,,996,4.232804232804233
8419950,3,B004AC6PW6,"Much more vigorous than her previous dvd's.  Hard to keep up with. Also, the stretch at the end is all done on the floor, which I don't like.",1468886400,3,141,4.035714285714286
8419951,5,B004AC6PW6,Good low impact workout for women over 60 age group.,1443916800,,52,4.3
8419952,5,B004AC6PW6,Good workout for anyone who needs a more modified workout.  You can work at your own pace gearing up or down as needed.  Enjoyable.,1441670400,,131,4.416666666666667
8419953,5,B004AC6PW6,"So far, so good!  I like this particular video and now use it with Sue Grant's ""Older and Much Wiser"" video. Both are suited to older folks who desire to remain nimble. (I'm still lagging in the wisdom stakes though).",1431043200,2,217,4.425
