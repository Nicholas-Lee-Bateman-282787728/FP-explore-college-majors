7882569,4,6305039135,"The tape in this four-volume set brings back memories. Most of the commercials in this volume includes ads for many Procter and Gamble products. For many years P&G has been the nation's largest advertiser, and many of the company's products(e.g.,Crest, Safeguard, Ivory Soap, Crisco, Scope, Bounty)are by far the nation's best selling brands, and they are revived successfully in this tape, which also has ads for Quisp cereal, Jell-O (advertised by the vocal group The Fifth Dimension), the 1969
Plymouth (with a cartoon favorite, the Road Runner), and many more. Serious nostalgia buffs--especially those loyal to P&G products--will want this tape.",1000425600,3,650,5.445544554455446
