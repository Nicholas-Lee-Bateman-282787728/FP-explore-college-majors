8746159,4,B019WN873M,"Not a bad Jazz instructional dvd at all. I'm not an ""absolute beginner"" but new to Jazz. I was able to get through it pretty quickly but picked up some good stuff. Good theory for beginners as well. I left out a star only because he teaches a couple of tunes at the end based on standards but doesn't tell you what they are. I understand copyright and all that but post it somewhere. I played them for some people who said"" that's nice, what tune is that?"" and I could only say ""I have no idea."" :)",1457654400,,498,4.091836734693878
