6303837,5,B00IXL1HMI,Not just for kids!  I loved to read as a kid and this movie evoked vivid memories of the joy of discovering the adventurous and exciting world revealed through books.  And for kids it is the sort of reinforcement that could lead to an increased and sustained interest in reading (plus it's a good movie that they'll enjoy).,1419811200,,323,4.551724137931035
6303838,5,B00IXL1HMI,"This was beautiful drawn (visually scrumptious), and it was told in a warm and original voice. So worth it! It had complexity and intrigue, depth and warmth. This is very much worth a watch.",1419724800,3,190,4.617647058823529
6303839,1,B00IXL1HMI,Do not recommend this movie because of the witchcraft/occultism.  A sad attempt to indoctrinate kids early.,1419379200,2,107,5.6875

6303841,5,B00IXL1HMI,"With the fact that my wife is a librarian, this DVD was perfect. While I had never heard of this character, now this DVD prior to watching it, I have to say that we really enjoyed it altogether and we all we entranced by the artwork and the story itself. We loved how the books and characters came to life, as in a good book that is what we want to happen. In this movie however, the characters themselves come to life literally! The DVD offers action, adventure, a nemesis and much more, what more could you ask for! While I do not always watch foreign films, this was a great DVD, and my kids and I loved watching it and imagining a world like this for ourselves too!

6303844,5,B00IXL1HMI,"I have a 6 year old daughter. Every weekend, we have a family movie night and snuggle together, with popcorn. It's not unusual for me to spend up to an hour reading reviews of movie options each week to find an appropriate movie. These days, a rated-G movie is what used to be considered a PG movie 15-20 years ago. This was not your typical princess movie, which I liked. The art work and story line were stellar. Aside from the antagonistic sister, who can be somewhat cruel to her younger brother and oddly, is never corrected by the parents, the movie was wonderful. The 3 of us loved it.",1466899200,2,592,4.390909090909091

6303860,5,B00IXL1HMI,"It's a good story about a child who has trouble reading and lacks self confidence. It dosn'thave the best animation, but i think it adds to the idea of the story characters coming to life. I like the message and ejoyed watching this with my children.",1454198400,,250,4.456521739130435
6303861,4,B00IXL1HMI,Delightful. My 6 year old loved it. The story line is engaging and she was hanging on the edge of her seat until the end. None of the Hollywood/Disney fluff and nonsense.,1454112000,,170,4.34375
6303862,5,B00IXL1HMI,I enjoyed this movie very much and the art work is beautiful.,1448064000,,61,4.166666666666667
6303863,5,B00IXL1HMI,My new favorite movie!!!,1447718400,,24,5.25
6303864,3,B00IXL1HMI,"The visuals are very beautiful and had very lovely colors and character design. My problem was with more with the story and character arcs. Nat has a hard time being able to read, but learns to read by the end. How, why? Not really explained. He does have nightmares and anxiety over not being able to read, but I feel like there was very little build up to him finally being able to read. The plot also doesn't really get going until thirty minutes in. By the way the action went, it seemed like the lesson was that Nat should be more adventurous. The sister was an incidental character who reacted surprisingly well to her brother becoming tiny and turned to his side pretty quick considering their antagonistic relationship.
Eleanor was just ""the mysterious figure"" and I didn't really get any sense of the bond she and Nat shared other than the characters telling us so. She read aloud to Nat and cared for the fairytale characters, those are her only defining features. Oh yeah, and the whole issue with the house is solved by Angelica, who finds a whole bunch of gold in a doll she was given. Sure glad there were absolutely no consequences and that Eleanor's other secret was that she was secretly stinkin' rich. There's a lot of things that bugged me about this movie, but I'm not going to list every single problem. I will agree that it illustrates anxiety very well with Nat being overwhelmed by the words even though in reality he is just staring at a page.
Who will enjoy it? Young kids and people looking just for some nice animation to kill an hour and a half.",1447027200,,1574,4.506993006993007

6303866,5,B00IXL1HMI,My son loves this show - he has watched in probably 8 times (from when he was 6 years old to 7 years old).  The story keeps his attention throughout and encourages him to read.  Wish there were more like it.,1442361600,,207,4.024390243902439

6303869,4,B00IXL1HMI,"Nice story and the animation, although rather spare, is charming in it's way.  If you're used to Disneyesque style animation (which I am) you will feel this lacks dimension and realism...but it has it's own appeal.

Even though reading comes easily to her, she is able to relate to the fears and anxieties that the character feels as well as the delight of meeting so many interesting and sometimes intimidating characters.  My 3 y.o. loves the movie too but gets a bit afraid during certain sections of the movie.  I highly recommend this movie.

They go with their family to spend some days in the house by the beache of Aunt Eleanor's, who just passed away, and left the house to them. In this house there is a very special room that nobody had access before and Matt is left in charge of whatever is inside.

I was happy to know that I could keep that magic alive for generations to come! And now I have discovered Eleanor's Secret! It took me back to that time of wonder, bringing the intensity of it all back to life for me. These children had an Eleanor with a secret room filled with books. I had an Aunt Tessie, with a huge porch behind heavily curtained funeral doors in a magically old house. That porch was filled with books of every description, and when I was finally able to read, I was allowed to spend endless hours of discovery there. How I identified with the children of this amazing story!

8646057,4,B00IXL1HMI,"This was lovely!  My kids (ages 3 and 5) loved it.  I'm pretty particular about the quality of animation, as well as subject matter and presentation - so many G films these days have much that still is not appropriate for a pre-schooler.  However this movie was  fit the bill.  It was well-drawn, and lovely background (the animation had that distinctly French look not unlike some of the more well-known French animated films). The themes were appropriate and the story line moved along without getting boring.  All in all a very nice little film. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention.",1474070400,,595,4.841584158415841

8646061,3,B00IXL1HMI,"I think this was recommended after we watched Song of the Sea.  Eleanor's secret isn't nearly as good though.  The premise of the story isn't terrible, its more in the execution of the story.  I generally like watching these sort of fairy tales with my kids, but I found myself very bored.  Its worth watching for children.  But I will mention again that Song of the Sea, which my kids love, is a much better story and is executed beautifully.",1470009600,,443,4.4875
