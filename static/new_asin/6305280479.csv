An emotional,moving experience!",1294531200,,139,5.318181818181818
8392921,1,6305280479,"Schmerberg is an artist, he probably could make a great Sting or Peter Gabriel or U2 video all musicians who put on a global front, but from his short serious statement of intent, his wish to change European textbooks and let people know Africa, the film was shot in Camaroon, but I guess he means the entire continent, is a wonderful place, places the creator as socialist, historian, and anthropologist. Even if during his comments he would have said ""I just wanted to make a black and white film combing Africans and techno music, his methods are still suspicious.  What if he would have turned his lens on San Bernadino or the Tenderloin or even just the people of his own country.  He could have used the same music, but would he have used the lazy susan or thrown candy at them? This film is really too easy of a target. I presented a paper on Hommage  A Noir in California recently and people laughed at it.",987465600,3,914,4.461077844311378
8392922,3,6305280479,"This film is not a documentary, but one German filmmaker's visual montage of ""those strange, exotic beings"" that inhabit Africa (actually just one small corner of Africa, the country of Cameroon). Schmerberg, as director, places his ""subjects"" on display (turning 'round on a lazy susan), throws candy at the children to animate them, directs the men to look fierce as they slowly pull their blades from their sheaths, etc., etc. ""Hommage a Noir"" is in some respects visually stunning, and the music is interesting in its own right (though *utterly* disconnected to its subject). But it is also offensive in it's stereotypical rendering of a foreign place and its inhabitants. Do not get this film if you expect anything close to documentary. And be prepared for a film that is as much indignity as it is homage.",986774400,6,812,4.934306569343065
