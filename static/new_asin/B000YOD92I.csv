The video does a nice job hitting the highlights of Ducati's story:  the history of the company including their many, many racing successes (Ducati is truly David battling Goliath(s) in the racing arena), the significant motorcycles over the years and their designers, their engine's unique valve actuation system, etc .  The DVD does spend some time showing Ducati's latest motorcycles - the Hypermotard,  Monsters, Multistrada, Sport Classics, Desmosedici RR, and the stunning 1098.  I didn't find the amount of time devoted to these motorcycles to be excessive though.  If anything I would have liked more coverage of the ultra-exotic Desmosedici RR and the 1098!  The DVD doesn't thoroughly delve into everything Ducati, it's only a 59 minute run time video!

So why only 4 or out of 5 stars then?  First of all, some clips of the various motorcycles being put through their paces are shown more than once.  The clips aren't very long so it's not that bothersome but one would think they had enough content at their disposal so that video would only need to be shown once, especially given how short this DVD is.  Secondly, the host Alain de Cadenet while coming across as very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Ducati, is a little quirky but nevertheless entertaining.  Finally, the interviews of the various Italian Ducati personnel can be difficult to understand at times but that is mostly due to their thickly accented English.  But at least there's no interpreters or sub-titles!  Speaking of audio, there is plenty of wonderful Ducati engine/exhaust noise without any annoying commentator babble.  That alone is worth the price of this DVD.  If you're a Ducatisti or an aspiring Ducatisti, you must own this DVD!",1216771200,8,1807,5.054054054054054
