8190600,4,B000PDW1GI,Gave us a decent preview at what to expect. Now Google mapping has the Canyon's trails for your pleasure so maybe bypass this one.,1429833600,,130,4.458333333333333
8190601,5,B000PDW1GI,"I purchased this DVD shortly after returning from our vacation on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  The vacation was spectacular, and we enjoyed the hiking.

However, this DVD would have given us an understanding of the trails far beyond a brief written description.  Actually seeing the trail, knowing where rest stops and water would be, and how difficult or demanding the trail would be, would have increased our enjoyment.

We are planning a second trip to the North Rim.  With this DVD we will be better prepared.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone visiting the Grand Canyon (North and South rims).",1278979200,2,609,4.8076923076923075
8190602,5,B000PDW1GI,"My girlfriend & I have a fantasy to add hiking & photographing the Grand Canyon to our other dream photo/hikes we've done in Hawaii over the past decade. So, I bought this DVD to get an idea of what we could expect at the Grand Canyon. If what we find at the canyon is anything like what's on this DVD, then I'm sure we'll be thrilled beyond belief. Being a hiker photographer, I can appreciate the difficult task of shooting video while you're actually on challenging hikes as this DVD was done. I thought this disc to be a great informational guide because the narrator does a great job of detailing what you'll find on each trail, as well as how you should prepare for the challenge of each hike. However, even if you're not a hiker, or you're not planning to go to the canyon at all, you'll still love the stunning beauty and jaw-dropping views that are captured on this disc.",1232323200,3,880,4.404907975460123
8190603,5,B000PDW1GI,This DVD is an outstanding overview of the number and variety of hikes available to take into the Grand Canyon.  The instruction is detailed and the views are amazing.  I am planning my own hiking trip into the canyon based on this DVD.  I highly recommend it.,1211414400,3,260,4.48936170212766
8190604,5,B000PDW1GI,"I own both of the Grand Canyon trail DVDs offered on Amazon. The other DVD (Corridor Trails) covers 3 trails while this program covers 14 (the 3 covered in ""Corridor Trails"" + 11 more). An additional bonus is that this DVD gives a quick overview of the stores, restaurants, hotels and campgrounds on the north and south Rims.

This DVD mentions specific locations to see indian paintings (Bright Angel Trail) and fossils (Hermit Trail), etc. These are easy to miss if you don't know where to look; and this insight isn't in ""Corridor Trails"", nor is it in the Grand Canyon hiking guidebook that I own.

This DVD & ""Corridor Trails"" both include tips on hiking safely in the Grand Canyon.",1194134400,3,687,4.669421487603306
8190605,4,B000PDW1GI,"Jon is a professional narrator.  This DVD is perfect for a family planning a trip to the Grand Canyon.  The information is beneficial to the curious or concerned hiker entering the park for the first time.  Several seldom-covered-trails on the North Rim are included.  Jon offers general information to prepare you for the hikes and a pleasant visit to the park.  Be sure to watch the brief ""Guide to the DVD"" to understand how the information is presented.",1191888000,5,457,4.8076923076923075
8190606,5,B000PDW1GI,"This is an excellent guide to the Canyon for anyone who's thinking about hiking there.  I've hiked in the Canyon numerous times and this DVD is right on the money in describing the various trails, trailhead locations, degree of difficulty, what you'll see, etc.  There's also sections (with contact info) on the various lodging facilities on both rims.  The narration is enjoyable, the filming is first rate and the DVD is very easy to use.  Even for those of you who have hiked these trails it's a fun way to relive those experiences (as I did).  I highly recommend it.",1179705600,2,570,4.66
8190607,5,B000PDW1GI,"When it comes to the Grand Canyon, there are three different kind of people:

1) Those who have been there already

2) Those who want to go there

3) Those who don't think they want to go there

This DVD is for all of these types of people: for those who have already been there, it is a combination souvenir/reminder of their trip and, for almost all of them, a window into areas of the Grand Canyon they probably didn't get a chance to explore and possibly didn't even know existed.

For those who want to go (and for those who have been and want to return), it is a valuable guide helping them to plan their trip so as to make the most of their time there and enjoy the park to the full.

In addition to the beautiful photography and interesting narrative, this hiking guide is chock full of tips on where to go, when, and how to prepare yourself when making your foray into the depths of this natural wonder. A great many hiking trails are outlined in detail, the videographer guiding you along the way on trips of various lengths and skill/stamina levels.

For the final demographic (those who don't think they want to go to the Grand Canyon) they may want to think again--Arizona's Grand Canyon is not ""just a big hole in the ground."" And it offers differing ""faces"" to its visitors depending on when they go--which season of the year and even time of day. Of course, one's exact location above or from within the canyon can make all the difference, too.

If it is simply impossible for a person to go, watching this DVD is the next-best thing to being there--vicariously accompany the videographer/narrator Jon Shannon as he does the walking for you.

In short, this DVD is entertaining, educational, and can save you lots of time, money, and headaches on your trip to this awe-inspiring corner of the Great American West.",1179360000,5,1829,4.5181818181818185
