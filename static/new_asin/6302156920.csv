7821941,5,6302156920,"I really could not find any flaw in the movie, the only thing is that they briefly show the presidential quarters! Otherwise, this is a wonderful collection of the shots about the Flying White House! Get the movie! It is the worth of price and you will enjoy watching it! The movie is particularly interesting for foreigners! Americans may and can see the plane individually, they have this chance!",970704000,3,398,4.782608695652174
7821942,4,6302156920,"I had first seen this on the History Channel and when I found out it was coming on video, I got it immediately.  It was a very impressing film.  I was fascinated to learn about the history of Air Force One and how  presidential travel by air was formed.  I was also surprised that they had  interviews with former presidents and Air Force One crewmembers which I  enjoyed.  I think that this a really great film and I think it's worth  watching.",964224000,,445,4.341463414634147
