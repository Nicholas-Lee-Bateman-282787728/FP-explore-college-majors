I felt that all the magnificient details of beautiful set designs, colorful costumes, epic battle scenes and dances were all shown wonderfully in this film. The copy of this DVD was not bad at all. The cover of the case does not look exactly like what is being shown here, but the movie was of excellent quality, and it is truly worth collecting. If you like to collect Mythologicals as I do, I would gladly suggest this film.",1339718400,,679,4.263565891472868
