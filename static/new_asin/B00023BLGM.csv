From the people who brought you ""Cops"" bring some of the most thrilling, shocking and amazing  moments caught on camera. The footage isn't that recent which isn't a bad thing. I personally enjoy watching it and you may too. This DVD has many events caught on camera like the Ramstein air show tragedy which is one of the deadliest air show disasters in history. Also features events like a oil tank explosion, firefighters who risk their life to save others, hostage standoffs, a tornado hitting an air-force base and even a Ferris wheel accident.",1429142400,,671,4.834782608695652
