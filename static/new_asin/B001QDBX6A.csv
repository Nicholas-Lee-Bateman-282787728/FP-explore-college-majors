3764213,4,B001QDBX6A,"Eden Log is the type of movie you'll either LOVE or totally HATE. I fell on the love side of it. A lot of cinema today has the same premise in every film, and they basically candy coat it for a slightly different spin. Eden Log was refreshingly original. The film plays out like an old survival horror video game, where you aren't entirely sure whats' going on, but you slowly piece it together with the main character. I won't put in any spoilers, but I will say that this film is very unique, and I am now interested in seeing more of Franck Vestiel's work.",1242086400,9,559,4.283018867924528

Watching this film is like being attacked by dark and evil spirits who revel in the sufferings of others; who are always angry, skeptical and negative, blaming others, violent in their intentions and cruel . The filmmaker and screenplay offer no redemption from any of this evil except to turn out the lights. I was stunned by the lack of any compassion, the sexual cruelty, the darkness and despair of being in hell. What a shame.",1442448000,,565,4.4423076923076925

I have been a great  fan of sci fi since the 50's and I felt robbed of 101 minutes of my life.  I gave the film 2 stars only because of Clovis Cornillac's ability to keep me in the dark even more so than his character.  As he progressed through a dark labyrinth trying to grasp the meaning of the horror around him I never experienced any of the enlightenment he seemed to find.

Clovis Cornillac plays the antagonist/protagonist.... somewhat woodenly, in a film it seems to have no beginning middle or end and which seems entirely implausible. At the very end I'm not sure what the goal was maybe to save mankind maybe just save a city maybe to save the project but he plugs himself in by sticking a Tree Root into his belly button and somehow charging up a monsterous plant that grows all over what appears to be a dead city.

I know three things about Eden Log. somehow gods eatin was supposed to be right into existence in the film. Secondly even log was the name of the underground facility where clovis corn lax character find some self in the beginning of the film. And finally it was a difficult time to watch primarily because it was such a bad film.

3764258,5,B001QDBX6A,"Absolute brilliance!! First off I realize this will probably never be read. After all, i'm writing a review for a little known movie almost 10 years too late.  However, I just saw it so it's whatever.

I paid a whole $1 for this in a dvd bargain bin just because why not? I wasn't expecting much and knrw bothing about it going in.

I won't spoil it, but basically we see things first person after the lead character wakes up in a dark damp environment with no idea where he is or how to escape.  From there we follow along as he makes his way out discovering things along the way as he does until it is more or less all tied together in the end.

I understand the criticism of this movie. It comes from the same people who complain about how there's no originality in movies anymore.  Yet give them a truly original movie open for interpretation that requires careful attention and examination to understand, and they call it nonsensical trash.

It certainly could have benefited from a higher budget and better effects but, seriously, what else do you want?  It makes you THINK which is what art should do.  However, we're so used to cookie cutter movies that do little but entertain, we balk at the ones that require honest examination to understand.

This is true art. Sure, it has flaws but it's probably the best i've seen in at least 5 years and I'm a movie junkie.  Watch it before you read the various explanations found here and elsewhere and develop your own interpretation.  You won't be dissappointed",1430265600,,1513,4.522058823529412

He walks around this maze avoiding monsters and what appears to be soldiers.  He runs into a few people who talk to him and give him tidbits of information.  Apparently, there is a division of society and the lesser people are forced to work underground in order to save the people on the surface.  This guy is trying to figure it all out.

Well, too bad. It exists anyway. ""Eden Log"" can be added to the long, long list of sci-fi movies that might have been interesting if they were only fifteen minutes long, and didn't have endless, ghastly scenes of the protagonist slobbing around in near-darkness, raping women and not having any personality. There's clearly meant to be some kind of metaphorical or symbolic quality to the ""story,"" but it's so torturously unpleasant to watch that it's impossible to care what it is.

A man with amnesia wakes in an underground cavern, with a corpse next to him. At least, that is what I think happens. It's so dark and the camerawork so choppy, with only the occasional strobe light, that it is nearly impossible to see what's going on. There's water, and mud, and he crawls out of it... very slowly... and walks... very slowly... and some some things with electronics in the dark that I can't make out because THEY'RE IN THE DARK. This goes on for several minutes. Then he climbs into something that I can't see because it's still dark, and bangs on a metal door.

He continues wandering around some underground facility, encountering some maps covered in fishing nets, holograms talking in corporate cliches about ""citizenship"" and ""Eden Log,"" and a crazy man being slowly absorbed by massive plants. There are also mutants roaming through the place, infected by a mysterious pathogen.

The man himself seems to have been infected as well, since he regularly blacks out, roars like the plant that surrounds this place (don't ask) and infects a woman through what is apparently plant-induced rape (just go with it). He continues wandering through the place, hearing other people arguing and conversing regularly about ""rezo"" and someone who is hiding. Only by discovering his true identity, and the reason he was trapped underground, can he figure out what has caused all this -- and the horrifying facts about the ""rezo"" and the plant.

""Eden Log"" is one of the most viscerally, painfully unpleasant movies I have ever seen in my life. The entire film feels coated in damp mud, sweat and shame, as if someone plunged you into the hellish lower levels of an abandoned waste treatment plant. Normally in a bad movie, there exists something that can be enjoyed or at least observed on a humorous, ironic level... but in this case, it's just the torturous slog of tedium trying desperately to convince us that it has some kind of depth or story to tell. In short, it is the journey of a person we don't like or know about doing things we can't see and bringing undefined change to a world we don't have a reason to care about either way.

Excited yet?

There is clearly meant to be some kind of symbolic quality to the story, since it's about... a tree. Trees are symbolic in religion and mythology... but this lazy effort to associate it with the Book of Genesis makes little sense when you consider its part in the actual story. That story is mostly silent and told through the main character's discovery, as he knows little to nothing about what is going on, and the explanation for what happened to him and how he came to be in that cavern, covered in sludge, is gradually revealed if viewers haven't fallen into a coma yet.

The problem is... I do not care about the main character's journey. Clovis Cornillac does not have the charisma or acting talent to make up for the utter lack of characterization, since his default expression is ""dull surprise"" and he rarely speaks to anyone. The main character is a complete cipher even at the story's end, a near-silent flesh golem who grunts and staggers around the caves with a flashlight. Squinting uncomprehendingly at everything and pawing at tubes is not character development. When he randomly rapes a woman in an elevator, it was impossible to tell if he was being controlled or if he was just despicable... because we do not know this man, either by actions or backstory. It seems to be assumed that viewers will like and sympathize with him just because he's been onscreen for most of the movie, even though he seems like kind of a jerk on the rare occasions when he speaks.

Admittedly, a few of the better-lit scenes are somewhat interesting, such as when the man is captured by a botanist in a high-tech clean suit suspended from the ceiling. But most scenes are so horribly lit that it is nearly impossible to know what is going on at any time -- it feels like someone got control of a run-down old factory and some filthy caves, and furnished it with random refuse from the hardware store. Lots of tubes and fans and the occasional turnstile, often placed in areas that make no sense.

It also contains one of the single worst fight scenes in the history of film, when the protagonist encounters a mutant in a lab, and shields himself from attack... with a rope. A single piece of rope. Good thing the mutant didn't realize that it could draw back its hand and take another swipe at him, and good thing it has a ridiculously slow attack speed.

Incomprehensible and a chore to watch, ""Eden Log"" is one of those movies that just leaves you feeling kind of dirty and bleak afterwards -- and not by the intent of the filmmakers. Leave this one in the filth-encrusted cave where you found it.",1422576000,4,5427,4.660397074190177

But it's no meant for them. Its audience is composed of people who love Lynch, Bunuel, Miike, Cronenberg, and Jodorowsky. Yes, the symbolism is apparent...corporate society, exploitation of natural and human resources, creative impulses gone wrong, a thin, blurry line between rape and lovemaking, and of course all sorts of images from the biblical Genesis: all these are sources of symbols. But the movie does NOT tell you how you're supposed to put the puzzle pieces together. This is an element in common with many films (not all, but many of the best) of the directors (auteurs as well, the lot of them) listed above. Sure, the ending MIGHT be an environmentalist fantasy, but it's equally a religious symbol of a return to Eden, and at the same time it's not really certain that we're supposed to think of the ending as a good thing.

Not being a fan of cinema that includes lots of near-total-darkness or strobe light scenes, I almost stopped the movie just over that. The first 5 minutes or so? TOTAL darkness and strobe lights.

3764404,3,B001QDBX6A,"Where to begin. First I suppose I should point out that many people (both those who hate it and those who love it) seem to disagree with what the film is about and what kind of genera it falls into.  It is not a horror movie, it is a psychological science fiction thriller.  It is not about the environment, it is the story of a distopian society where immigrants are sent to 'work' at the Eden Log power facility, only the facility doesn't work the way the general public believes, the tree (an engineered tree located at eden log) that was supposed to produces the energy for the city went 'rouge' protecting itself by mutating victims into monsters.  Unable to drain the energy sap from the tree the Eden Log crew needed a new way to generate energy, enter the immigrants. Who are drained in a plantation to provide the energy.  The issue we face (as viewers) is that we view the entire story from the inside out, not just from inside the eden log facility, but from the inside of the muddled mind of someone who isn't sure what is going on himself.  On top of that what we say takes place after the facility is on the brink of collapse from the mutants.  Ultimately the protagonist decides that the best course of action is to end it all using himself as a catalyst for the downfall of civilization, possibly of humanity.

Core concept wise it isn't a bad story, or a bad approach to telling an interesting dystopian tale.  However, it falls flat on the execution of the film.  As I understand it the film was originally in French and that some things may be lost in translation, and that the voice acting may have more to do with some of the 'acting' problems than the actual acting did.  Whatever, I can ignore that for the time being.

Just a quick repost of the synopsis for anyone who has already forgotten ""A man wakes up deep inside a cave. Suffering amnesia, he has no recollection of how he came to be here or of what happened to the man whose body he finds beside him. Tailed by a mysterious creature, he must continue through this strange and fantastic world.""

Getting right into the film the first thing we notice (as others have pointed out) is a pretty long sequence relying on a bright flashing light.  Kind of annoying, however, what gets me here and my first criticism of the actual film is that the protagonist who supposedly remembers nothing at this point (or so we are led to believe by the synopsis given by Amazon) he does no exploring, doesn't look around, just immediately starts climbing (when he was obviously in a larger chamber).  Moving on he continues to fail to look around or search bodies for anything useful.  I mean he is half naked without a weapon  Why does he only bother collecting the data disk and a jacket?  We find out at the end of the film this guy is some kind of a security specialist sent into the depths of the Eden Log facility to quell the immigrant uprising (you know vicious mutants and people who discovered that they are there to die).  If we assume his reasoning behind making a B-line is that he was guided by instinct, wouldn't his instinct as a security specialist be to arm himself against the unknown?  Just saying.

Continuing on, he runs into members of the security team.  I remind you that at this point he is not in any sort of disguise, yet they hunt him and don't seem to recognize him.  Neither does the scientist he runs into, who hooks him up to the tree (which then feeds off of him).  She seems shocked at this, later however we see the report from her level of the lab showing that she knows it is eating people.  Why is she surprised?  Also why does she not recognize someone who is obviously important to the operations of the facility?  They never met or ran across each other?  Fine we can go with that.  She runs off and leaves him for dead.  He makes chase and catches her in the elevator, turns out he is infected with the mutation.  Though they aren't clear on it he has been infected the whole time (though he may or may not be a carrier).  He proceeds to rape her.

Dragging on we collect more memory cards and nothing else, we take no time for the development of the characters or the situation.  We simply know that they are in danger from the mutants and trying to get out.  At the top (because nothing really important happens between when they meet and when they get to the top) she realizes she is infected and leaves (leaving him with her memory card).  He scoots past the guards and transmits all of the memory cards to the surface and realizes that he is one of the security team.  His concious bugs him though and rather than re-starting the facility he hooks himself in, feeds the tree his mutant blood, and brings about the end of the Eden Log facility.

My two biggest issues with this film are (and in no particular order of import):  First, it drug on without really adding to the story, plot, or character development.  One person who gave a bad review stated that this 1.5 hour movie felt like 5.  Maybe not 5, but definitely 3.  It didn't sustain and it didn't deliver, it is perfectly fine to leave things to the viewers imagination, but we shouldn't have to develop the characters in our minds too.  Second, this film was just begging to be an art film, but it failed.  The desaturation was more distracting than anything.  The attempt at creating a mood with sound and flashing lights and heavy breathing fell to the mood of a film an amateur might have made on his/her first project.  Because this film was trying so hard to be artistic it failed on the sci-fi and thriller accounts as well, obvious and trite the people who call this a cerebral film probably say the same thing about M. Night Shamalan's work.  Feeling the need to drag the greater part of exposition to the last 5 minutes of the film (which makes you wonder about the value of the other 85), they lost the concept that a film or a story is a journey and not a destination.  This film was like driving through Iowa on your way to somewhere interesting, nothing to see the entire trip and then it all comes at once.

What is sad, is that it could have been a really, really good film.  Could have been, but wasn't.  I normally frown upon remakes especially of films that aren't that old, but I would love to see this re-made by someone who actually knew what they were doing, because it would be phenomenal.",1404864000,,6385,4.406143344709897

Camera techniques need improvement. The camera was shaking in many parts of the movie and it doesn't make sense unless the camera is supposed to be the point of view of someone in the movie (and it isn't).

The black and white coloring doesn't add to the movie. With the main protagonist lost and without his memories, the viewers of the movie are supposed to follow along in the protagonist's journey of discovery. It doesn't help the viewer's imagination or immersion with everything so covered in darkness.

I generally enjoy movies that try to do something new and different (god knows trying something new is more interesting than rehashing the typical blockbuster garbage we get so often), but sometimes it just falls flat. This movie is one of the times it falls flat.

A lot of scenes drag on too long and feel pointless. The opening has the dubious honor of being the single most obnoxious, overly long, headache-inducing piece of cinematography I've ever seen. (Any filmmaker who wants to use strobing light, let alone for several minutes straight at the beginning of a film, should be slapped.)

Eden Log also uses that shallow ""throw a rape in there as a shortcut to illustrate eeevil"" thing that lousy filmmakers and writers so often like to use, and it is as ill-advised and ugly as ever. In a movie like this, it's about as sophisticated as having the character kick a puppy to show HUMANS BAD.

It must have been hell to get it done in the first place, then edit it into something tangible and viewable. The lighting must have been a serious challenge. The popping light at the beginning drove me nuts initially - and that was the point. The man came up out of the mud, in the pitch black, with light snapping in his face and the idea was to make you feel it. The camera men were probably whispering camera-god-prayers, hoping that nothing bumped or moved the cameras in the dark. Editing the original footage must have been like stalking naked through mud and glass - broken or otherwise. Initially the movie intrigued me and I will watch it again, if for no other reason than to pay the film crew, editor and set designers, homage.

For those who are more used to foreign films where the pacing is more deliberative and atmosphere is important, this film is worth watching. It is moody science fiction with a clear ecological science fiction plot. The film unwinds the story through pieces in a deliberative fashion, and I think for many genre fans this is a turn off.  In some ways it share some of the aspects of the first cube film in it's puzzle approach. There is not much dialog in the film, and it does not tell the story directly at first.

This is no stinker, but it is either love or hate.

3764505,3,B001QDBX6A,"If you like hard scifi, you may like this film.  Unlike Hollywood pulse-pounding formula films, this one has a slowly unwinding mystery - the answers are revealed piece by piece, but enough of it is left obscure for the viewer to fill it in with his imagination.  Now, the subjective part is that you have to like it, which is a personal reaction.  I believed the characters from the very beginning and was intrigued with finding out what was really going on, which I would never have predicted.  It kept my interest and I found it intellectually stimulating.  However, it is not for everyone.  The pace is static, much of it remains obscure, and the symbolism does get a bit heavy.

A man wakes up in a cold, wet cave.  Without memory, he seems to do alright going around by instinct, searching for something or some way out.  He has a number of disturbing encounters, from a man seemingly permanently entangled in a tree, to monsters, scientists, and military types.  He painstakingly elicits bits of information at each encounter, all the time running from forces that are pressing on him.  He is also going through some kind of transformation.  What is so French about it is the pessimism, lack of hope, and simple obscurity of the situation and action, which you would never see from Hollywood.

As so many have given their interpretations, I will allude to some of mine, hopefully without spoilers.  It appears that he is in some kind of giant industrial complex, almost an experiment.  Much of it has gone awry, it appears, but there is a system that works.  In the future, it seems, humans are attempting to harness botanic processes, though not with the results they had hoped.  There is the x-factor as well, as the amnesiac man seems to be carrying some kind of esoteric knowledge or capacity.

I don't go in for the biblical interpretations, which I believe require the viewer to twist things too much.  In my view, it is just good scifi, vivid, with a riddle to enjoy, and some action.  Recommended.",1356048000,2,2012,4.678062678062678

Sadly, this film drags on and on until it hits a descent ending that I slightly enjoyed. Most of the story was confusing until the end, where I was still a little confused. Dialogue is severely limited; acting was fine throughout most of the movie though.

What I did enjoy was the music. I also enjoyed the beautiful atmosphere the movie creates (although it does get repetitive b/c of how long it is).

3764515,4,B001QDBX6A,"Well, that was definitely a drearily and dark trip of your (my) own mind.  The writer and director were able to harness the most powerful special effect available that is cheap and free; your imagination. The vagueness of the whole movie, plot, and scenery pulls you in as you struggle with the lack of knowledge and information about everything. This movie plot is all about control through containment physically, and of mental knowledge, and the hero's attempt to understand and get away. At this point you are mirroring the hero's situation as the viewer. Then this concept is moved from the confines of the screen to mirroring of that concept in the viewers mind. Keeping the meaningful details of the plot to a bare minimum enables what is called ""projection"" by the viewer. Projections are unique to each person so the connecting details come from your mind making co-creator of the movie. This interface using your projections grabs you and hooks you into the experience. In the end the feelings of frustration, wanting to quit the movie, and were is this going are the feelings that you project into the character. It is difficult to rate this movie because of how different it is. How do you rate this movie? How you experience this movie is all about you, some could say this is real art where the real performance is your experience not what is on the screen. Its a bit like a roller coaster ride; some people can't wait to get off and others can't wait to do it again. I am still deciding if it was worth taking the whole trip or not. It was definitely for me worth at least exploring the experience.

Good science fiction movies in opinion: Blade Runner, Aliens, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Minority Report, Contact

Bad science fiction movies: The Hulk (the worst film possible for me), Armageddon, Judge Dredd

I stuck it out through the whole of Eden Log and wished I hadn't.  I sensed a decent story lurking there but never got it.  I looked it up on Wikipedia after so that I could have it explained to me.  The description on Wikipedia is a pretty decent story.  Do yourself a favor and just read that.  If I had been able to understand, or rather, just hear, some key dialogue I would have bumped it up to at least the same level as Event Horizon.  For some reason, the director or editor or somebody thought it would be a good idea to have the soundtrack and sound effects be much louder than most of the dialogue.  So the film never made sense to me.  I don't mind following bread crumbs to the story.  I think that was the intent of how this film was made, except I didn't get any bread crumbs either.

If they re-release this film with dialogue that you can hear, this film is worth watching.  Otherwise, let it stay down in the filfthy, garbage strewn lower levels where most of it is set.  I'd still rather watch this than The Hulk, but only just.",1311984000,4,1386,4.273076923076923
3764519,1,B001QDBX6A,"Why is this movie being compared to Pandorum? No similarity whatsoever except that both have mutants. Pandorum was exciting, disturbing, and had a great ending. This movie is none of the above. It starts with a flashing camera sequence that goes on for about 7 minutes and is likely to give you a migraine. Then we get darkness, jerky camera, and more darkness. The movie is only 98 minutes long, yet by the time it ended I felt like I'd spent five hours in front of the TV. Five very long, dark, and confusing hours.

Yes, it's atmospheric and surreal and all that. And that's all it is. The main idea in a nutshell is: humans bad, trees good. Corporations are arrogant and evil and must die. Heck, humans in general are arrogant and evil and must die... The plot is all over the place. The setting is too dark to appreciate. The characters are unsympathetic and unrealistic. For example, at some point the main character runs into a female survivor... And rapes her. Huh?.. Oh, wait. Right. It's to show just how evil we humans are. Unlike those nice, nice trees we abuse. (Except for the little fact that rapists are mentally unstable people, don't represent normal human behavior, or the majority of humans).

The ending is every radical environmentalist's wet dream: our hero has a ""revelation"" and condemns the entire humankind to death by letting us all be devoured by a giant tree. This finale is shown in a pretty, sparkling way with pretty music playing, which, I'm guessing, is supposed to signify a happy end... I guess if you believe the garbage these filmmakers seem to believe, then it is a happy end to a great movie. But if you have more faith in the human race than that, not to mention if you expect better storytelling and character development from your movies, then it's a horrible ending to a horrible, ill-conceived, and poorly-executed waste of celluloid.",1311552000,60,1880,4.693939393939394

3764530,4,B001QDBX6A,"I'm going to make a comparison here, that only a few select people are going to be able to relate to... but its the only way I can think of to describe the feeling of the film. Watching the first hour or so of this film reminded me of the first time I played the original Resident Evil on Playstation (we're talking the original game which was brilliant... not those hacky movies they made based on the game). There is this feeling of discovery you get while watching; you know there is this huge overarching mystery but you can't quite put your finger on what exactly it is.

I really enjoyed watching this, but even though I enjoyed it there are a couple things I must say that detract from the movie. First off it is just so dark, towards the end of the movie I found myself hoping we'd get just a little more light so I could see what was going on a little better... that being said this probably also added to the claustraphobic vibe, so I can see why they did it this way. Secondly I think the last quarter of the film was the weakest part of the movie, and it ended (for me at least) somewhat anticlimactic. I kept expecting a really brilliant moment of clarity in regards to the story, but what I got was something somewhat muddled that confuses the heck out of me. In fact as I'm writing this I still don't think I truly understand the overall plot of the film (thank God for IMDB message boards).

So all this being said, its the challenge of this film that is fun and makes it a good experience... and one that I'm glad I sat through. I wish more films took chances like this one, even if all the chances didn't pay off as much as I'd hoped. 3.5/5 stars.",1294358400,,1665,4.216300940438871

The film starts off interesting indeed creating many disorienting camera angles and lighting effects(at this point the respective audiance is left in darkness with fleeting glimpses of our hero,and his setting). It is from this point on that all allure is lost, as the story progresses our protagonist discovers many alarming (or predictable) plot developments. Amongst a crippled scientific research base riddled with mutants and trigger-happy soldiers he must find the answers to lead him to the end of this ""nightmare""! In a poor choice of storytelling there are multiple cutscenes used to create an understanding of a strange transformation with our hero. As for the dramatic twist ending, i wasn't very suprised nor was i impressed in fact it all felt very rushed leaving the impact of its signiture scene forgetable. All in all the story suffers from lack of continuity and poor direction with minimal effects and no progression of character self awarness.

The plot (once you figure it out, which is entirely possible on the first viewing if you pay a little bit of attention and are at all familiar with science fiction cliches) is pretty much a huge cliche.  The way the story is told is ok, but if you are familiar with the concept of ""flashbacks,"" it's not terribly impressive.  There is almost no dialog.  The acting is not great (impressive considering the actors have almost nothing to do acting-wise).  The actual filming of it varies from interesting to annoying (think Blair Witch Project), with emphasis on the annoying (lots of badly shot action, blank screens, slightly nauseating shaky cam).

3764540,4,B001QDBX6A,"Eden Log is a cyberpunk, experimental sci-fi that some (like me) consider a masterpiece--but be prepared to have the Wikipedia article on hand (or patient enough to watch it a few times) just to understand what you're seeing. It doesn't hand you anything--you have to work to figure out what's going on. SPOILER HINT: The main character is actually infected from the beginning, and he remembers some of the stuff that happens during flashes.) I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I can really understand why some people wouldn't--it is extremely complicated and, despite feeling like a self-discovery type of sci-fi videogame, almost seems like it would make a better short story than a movie. But if you're willing to work for your entertainment, it's well worth it. It's dubbed in English--and the voice actors aren't fantastic, so if you can somehow get your hands on an original French version, go that route, instead. As for the special effects that some people are trashing, I thought they were pretty good, actually--especially for a low-budget film. I thought it was typical of foreign cyberpunk or sci-fi/fantasy films (e.g., Tetsuo, City of Lost Children). Sure the effects aren't comparable to Star Wars--but they don't need to be for this kind of film. And the mutants, flickering lights, and dark atmosphere make it plenty creepy.

Combined with the mostly black-and-white footage, the end result is a very stylish film, which may or may not answer all your questions by the time you're done watching, but is nevertheless worth checking out.",1248739200,2,595,5.144329896907217
3764542,5,B001QDBX6A,"I saw Eden Log recently for the first time, and was so into it I almost immediately ordered a copy on DVD. While I understand that the Blu-ray version has technical shortcomings, my review here relates to the content of the film, both thematically and stylistically.

I don't want to give much away, because Eden Log does a great job of slowly unraveling a mysterious story over the course of the film. Toward the end when most things become revealed, I really had that ""Aha!"" moment you get when you realize a great puzzle was being untangled all throughout a story, and the clues that were there all along you were only vaguely understanding. For this reason I think the film merits multiple viewings.

The style is very dark and ""dingy"", fairly cyberpunk, but from the sub-sub-sub-basement of a futuristic kind of world perspective. If you've read the Japanese manga series Blame! you will find many similarities to Eden Log. Likewise, the movie borrows from the stylings of French BD sci-fi comics, and this is a great thing, as not enough films do! Perhaps similar in a sense to Immortal by Enki Bilal, which of course itself was his adaptation of his own BD comic.

Eden Log definitely is operating on several levels, in addition to the science fiction story itself. It is concerned with the environment and the planet, and how we as humans interact with and seek to control it, and create a feedback loop of negative consequences. It also has themes relating to immigration theory and nationalism/citizenship, and what some people do in order to pursue the dream of being a productive member of a ""free"" and prosperous society -- when in reality this is not what they are necessarily signing up for upon applying for citizenship. Other interesting themes abound as well, and because of all these subtleties I think this movie appeals more to an intellectual crowd.

Stylistically, I am extremely impressed by what the filmmakers pulled off with a presumably relatively small budget. Camera work, set design, and costume design are all EXCELLENT, and all serve to illustrate the ""darkness"" of the world of Eden Log. I am impressed by the acting, and even creature design. The movie is very dark, the colors very muted and affected, and the camera work jarring -- but it's all very intentional, and the overall effect I found very appealing.

So, maybe Eden Log won't appeal to your average Joe looking for a generic sci-fi horror action thriller -- but that's not the intent of this movie. I'd call it hard science fiction of a very artistic/stylized fashion, with intellectual social themes as an undercurrent.

3764544,3,B001QDBX6A,"I was not too impressed with this film. It was not the color, dialogue, captions, or the lack of a talking dinosaur that let me down- the movie failed to connect with me. For me, it was like watching The Blair Witch Project: you watch because it is something to watch and at the end you're left wanting a little more.

Rundown:
In this movie, ""Eden Log"" is a corporation that is trying to find an element to unite all people. Something goes wrong and like those Resident Evil travesties, a character gets amnesia and cant remember whats going on, comes across monsters, clean up teams, and the few survivors and computer files to just get a simple understanding before they conveniently die or break. The ending arrives when you expect it to but is lackluster. Thinking about it, ""Eden Log"" does seem like a French version of ""Resident Evil"".

Speaking on the plot, there needs to be some clarification. American cinema is not universal cinema. European films have their own method of engaging the audience. Knowing this will save a viewer frustration if they have not seen any imported films. Knowing key difference between American cinema and European cinema, Im still not sure ""Eden Log"" would be enjoyable to all. There could be some interesting takes on symbology, possible allegories, and the role of colors but Amazon is not the place.

I did not watch the English version. Im the type of viewer that watches a foreign film in its original language. This means, like the other reviews state, watching the poor quality version that is listed in the Special Features. To my surprise, the quality was not all that bad. The reason being, I watched the film on a PS3. Like most newer players, it upscalled the quality and fit the image to the widescreen TV. If anyone is to watch this movie on a player that does not upscale but is hooked up to any widescreen HDTV via RCA jacks, the quality is going to be horrible. Its simple technobabble. If a viewer has no issue with the higher quality English version then by all means watch that version.",1247011200,7,2046,4.6464088397790055
3764545,3,B001QDBX6A,"Ages ago when I was in high school I wrote an extremely abstruse short  story for an English class that was riddled with references that no one could decipher except for myself.  I thought it was oh-so-clever, a mini Finnegan's Wake.  When after reciting it I was presented with a room of blank stares I proudly went about explaining the symbolism.  No one cared.  I realized then that if one wants to create both a successful and weird/obscure/dissonant story, at least include a layer that is accessible to the casual reader.  Eden Log doesn't make such an attempt.

If an interminably long-feeling movie centered around an amnesiac man groping around in near darkness in an environment filled with broken plastic junk, tubes-n-wires, and columns of tree roots whilst pursued by cheesy looking humanoid monsters sounds appealing then this movie is for you!

The movie is about a not-too-distant world where energy is harvested from an enormous tree.  The ""power plant"" (haha - cute) named Eden Log is a secret subterranean facility where columns of tree root are exposed for study, experimentation, and work associated with energy generation.  Eden Log is populated by human subjects, mutants, technical staff, and a militaristic guard.  Humans are intravenously given sap from this special tree which does (2) things: 1) creates a symbiotic relationship between plant and human wherein both species develop a biological understanding of the other and 2) humans are subsequently infected during sap exposure and mutated into dumb humanoid monsters that are then boxed and suspended in the tree canopy.  The tree generates energy while digesting the subjects.  Things would be dandy except that there is a revolt among the Eden Log population forcing an intervention by the militaristic guard.
If this makes any sense at all I promise it makes less sense in the movie.

On another level it's a modern retelling of Genesis and the Resurrection.  The main character, the amnesiac, is Adam in the Garden of Eden (Eden Log).  He awakens (born), almost naked and wanders around trying to make sense of this new place.  Ultimately what he's seeking is knowledge (Tree of Knowledge) but once he obtains that knowledge the damage is irreversible.  He meets a woman (Eve) who tricks him into having the tree sap injected into his system whereupon he mutates (Fall of Man).  He gets a data disk (apple) containing information pertaining to his own identity and the purpose of Eden Log.  In order to solve the rest of the puzzle, the viewer has to link the Garden of Eden to the Resurrection.  In Christian lore the fall of man (disobeying God by eating the apple) is the first original sin from which mankind is not absolved from until the sacrifice of the crucifixion.  So lock and step, the movie closes the loop by having the main character (forgot his name) sacrifice himself while saying something to the effect of, I'm doing this for all of humanity, while simultaneously thrusting a tree limb into his stomach with arms outstretched as if on a cross.
If this makes any sense at all I promise it makes less sense in the movie.

I think the movie would have been tolerable if the main protagonist acted in a believable way.  Try to put yourself in this position: you, an amnesiac, suddenly wake up in a dark cave, disoriented, freezing cold in the mud, surrounded by dead bodies, and when finally another person is encountered you ask them ... nothing.  Our protagonist just isn't curious about his predicament I suppose.  What might you wonder in such a situation?  Where am I?  Why am I here?  How do I get out?  Are there any weapons?  What is your name?  What year is this?  Who is chasing me? On and on ad infinitum.

The problem is that everything is so incredibly stupid, slow, and nonsensical in this movie.  When a character walks into a big dark cavern we have to watch him slowly walk the entire length of the big dark cavern to get to the other side (60-120 seconds).  When a character is breathing heavily trying to crawl up a tube we have to watch them heave slowly through 50 feet of tube (another 60-120 seconds).  All this wasted time accumulates.  I kept fast forwarding the movie.

It was too dark too see anything, no resolution was offered and no apparent plot beyond some kind of tree that provided power to cities in the future at the apparent cost of human lives.  I felt cheated at the end that no clear explanation was forthcoming.  I can't for the life of me understand why anyone thought this film was award winning or ground breaking.",1245801600,6,424,4.275

Don't waste a cent on this one !!! 3 of us very ardent horror sci fi buffs watched it together and we had one conclusion in common Absolute Rubbish !! The theme of the movie, which we think was vampires modern day, was just a complete shambles !! Creepy !!!! no way !! too much camera flitting around and light and dark flashes. The English dubbing was also atrocious couldn't understand a word what they were saying (all 3 of us) Well ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" you've finally got rolled !! We also watched ""Taken"" (Liam Neeson) in the same viewing ""Now there's a really great movie to watch"" Happy Viewing all !!",1245110400,6,663,4.442622950819672
3764548,1,B001QDBX6A,"This movie was great.  It was very creepy and atmospheric.  However, I found myself to be infuriated by the idiocy of the Blu-Ray transfer.  I hate dubbed movies.  I believe that a movie should be watched as the director intended it to be seen, and in the language it was created in.  I always watch foreign language films in the language with subtitles enabled.  However, on this Blu-Ray, there is NO OPTION to watch the movie in the original language (French) without going into the special features and selecting it... IN STANDARD DEFINITION!  In HD, one can only watch the English or Spanish dubbed version.  To recap, a brilliant film and a truly despicable shortcoming on the Blu-Ray.  I cannot believe the ignorance of the people who formatted this.",1245024000,14,756,4.7984496124031

That should have indicated to me to press ""stop"" on the dvd player. But no. I had to waste the full 90 minutes of my life. The entire dialog of this movie must fill only one page. The ""story"" is so obscure that the writers had to make a little cartoon animation at the end to explain it, and it still made very little sense. The guy crawls and climbs through various rooms, tunnels, tree roots, and goes nowhere. If this was a student film, the prerequisite being that the director had to use whatever rubber tubes, garbage bags, and tree branches could be found just lying around, and a strobe light, then OK. It might get a passing grade. But as a commercial release, nah. This movie should have been titled ""crawl,"" and boy, does it ever.",1243209600,10,881,4.478260869565218

3764551,4,B001QDBX6A,"After reading reviews of Eden Log, and after seeing the movie myself, I agree that you either love it or hate it.  There is little room for a middle of the road reaction to this one.  As with so many others, it's all about what you expect and appreciate from movies that break the mold of formula and predictability.

I tend to be more in love with the movie for its uniqueness above all else.  In a world where everything has already been done, making the newest of movies a clich&eacute;d rehash of something seen before, this movie goes all out to avoid those pitfalls, becoming something refreshingly new.  Of course, the inescapable and limited themes (man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. himself, etc.) are there, but that's where the familiarities end.

I must stress, however, that creating something new these days also involves a large amount of courage to create what can largely be disliked.  The director and writer of this movie had some serious courage, for sure.  Eden Log is incoherent much of the time, defying most attempts to make any sense of the plot through the better part of its running time.  However, any astute viewer will quickly realize and appreciate the fact that this movie is confusing by intention rather than by chance or failure.  Of course, I'm not suggesting that a movie can be good merely because it is confusing.  There is, I think, in this movie, order and meaning to be discovered, with enough patience and thought, within all the chaos and confusion.  Yes, from the very beginning, the viewer is offered a most unique puzzle to be solved.

The viewer is introduced to the main character in the pulsing bright light of an otherwise pitch-black cavern.  As for where this dark place is, no one can possibly know at this point.  Even whether it's on earth or elsewhere is not to be known.  As we watch the character emerge sluggishly from the mud and muck, we are, with flashing lights and confusion, about as disoriented as the character himself.  From there, the character attempts to learn who he is, just as we do, clumsily and often incorrectly connecting piecemeal clues found here and there.  Yes, this movie puts the viewer in the first person position, with virtually no objective views of anything.  All we see, hear, and experience are as subjective as that experienced by the main character.  He is pursued by mutant creatures of unknown significance, through endless passageways that mostly lead nowhere of importance.  Of course, I won't go on with anything more; I wouldn't want to spoil the charm of this movie for all those who may choose to see it.  Certainly that is the way this movie is best-watched anyway--without a single clue revealed by another viewer.  Even knowing what others think it all means is too much.  Again, the not-knowing is what truly makes this movie so unique and effective.  Some of the best movies leave much meaning to the mind of the viewer, instead of revealing everything there is to think and know.  Eden Log indeed plants many unique ideas in the mind of every individual who sees it.

Eden Log could have been another monument to mediocrity, easily forgotten and lost amongst everything else of its kind.  It could have played it safe and been like a million other movies getting, at least consistently, more so-so reviews.  Instead, it dares to be different and transcends the muck of mediocrity.",1243036800,55,3391,4.748717948717949
3764552,3,B001QDBX6A,"Just a month or two ago Magnet botched the subtitles on ""Let the right one in"" and there was a big online backlash.  You would think that they would tread a little more carefully with future releases but then we get this. It turns out that with ""Eden Log"" the only way to watch a high definition version of the film is with an English dubbed track.  The dubbed audio is in DTS master audio which is nice, but if you want to watch the ""French version"" (the original version) then you have to look in the extras and it will allow you to do this.  If you watch the ""French version"" it will be in standard definition!  That's right, if you pay a $10 premium to get the blu-ray of this film and want to see it in its unaltered state with the original language and subtitles then you must do it in standard definition and compressed audio (rather than DTS master audio) to go along with it.

Who do they have handling the blu-ray and dvd releases over at Magnet?  Why didn't they just put the subtitles and french audio (in DTS master audio would be nice) on the high definition version of the film and get rid of this standard def version of the film?  They are really shooting themselves in the foot with this ""six shooter film series"".

I'd give the film probably 3.5 or 4 stars though.",1243036800,15,1283,4.2727272727272725
3764553,4,B001QDBX6A,"In the words of a previous reviewer, Eden Log is reminiscent of an old school survival horror videogame.  Our protagonist (Clovis Cornillac) awakens naked covered in muck with no memory of where he is or how he got there, or even who he himself is either.  As the film goes along, we learn along with our protagonist that the strange world he finds himself in is anything but natural, and that he may have more in common with the otherworldly creatures that are making their presence known than he could ever imagine.  Deliberately paced, beautifully shot, and definitely occasionally incoherent and confusing; Eden Log is strangely compelling and magnetic to behold.  A French film originally filmed in 2007, seeing it finally make its way to our shores is a refreshing thing indeed.  Using little dialogue and letting the viewer piece together the proceedings along with the protagonist, director and screenwriter Franck Vestiel crafts a science fiction allegory that displays what the world we live in may in fact one day become.  It may take some time to get into and fully understand, but for what it's worth, Eden Log is a unique and worthwhile trip that is definitely worth taking.",1242691200,4,1188,4.915

I felt more like I was watching a poorly made video game then a film of any merit.
In trying to be, I guess, hip and avant garde the directors reach exceeded his grasp.
One waits for some action an gets confusing atmosphere peppered with forgettable monsters/mutants.
It is obtuse in plot and even when you get ""answers"" at the end, you are left unsatisfied.

8335393,3,B001QDBX6A,"Eden Log has a promising beginning: the pulsing light introduces the protagonist of the story and gets the viewer excited of what is to come.  Unfortunately, the pulsing lasted a perceived eternity and eventually turned annoying.  From there the movie crawled along slowly with intermittent action spurts.  Although I appreciate movies that are unique, have little dialog, and don't serve every tidbit on a platter, Eden Log had too little to hold on to.  No introduction, explanation at any point.  Essentially, everything is left hanging in the air.  The ""conversion"" of the female in the end  and what purpose it served (if any) is glossed over.  She disappears back where she came from.

The end seems to indicate that the protagonist's ""sacrifice"" kills the exploitative civilization and reverts back to nature.  All that could have been achieved in far less than 90 minutes and with a bit more pizzazz. The sexual encounter-turned-rape was completely gratuitous and served no purpose other than to show that the protagonist had a de-humanized side.

The hope that something would eventually happen kept me watching to the end.  Not the worst but certainly not one of the best science fiction movies around.  A twisted, bizarre movie without much substance.",1445299200,,1262,5.127450980392157
