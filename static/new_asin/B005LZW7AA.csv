8478826,4,B005LZW7AA,"Excellent movie. Although a child's tale, the resulting consequence from a misspent life turning into a donkey is very well portrayed and has an emotional impact. I am buying this film for my nephews and nieces so that they stay focused in school. In today's day and age where there is so much that can distract children and adolescents it is a good movie to show children.

On an artistic level, it is interesting and pleasing to see how Roberto Benigni plays the role of the puppet with no make up or design tricks to make him look like one. Additionally, the act was quite good. I like especially the acting done for Lucignolo, the boy that convinces Pinocchio to go to Play Land. His body movements, facial expressions and speech are very well done and fitting for the character.

The movie language sounds much better in Italian and French than in English (I speak all three languages). The English translation and its quality of speech was NOT done well. Only Medono who helps the fairy has an attractive voice and speech pattern.",1361664000,,1036,4.655737704918033
