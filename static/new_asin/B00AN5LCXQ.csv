5458674,5,B00AN5LCXQ,"In 1782, Choderlos de Lacios published his French epistolary novel ""Les Liaisons dangeruses"" (The Dangerous Liaisons).  The novel would inspire several films including the 1959 Roger Vadim film, a 1988 Stephen Frears film titled ""Dangerous Liaisons"", the 1989 film ""Valmont"" and the 1999 Roger Kumble film ""Cruel Intentions"".

In Korea, the film would lead to a 2003 film titled ""Untold Scandal"" by E J-yong and in 2012, a Chinese film by South Korean filmmaker Hur Jin-ho.

Hur Jin-ho is known for his films about love.  From his 1998 hit film ""Christmas in August"", his 2001 film ""One Fine Spring Day"", ""April Snow"" (2005), ""Happiness"" (2007) and ""A Good Rain Knows"" (2009).  The latter film which would feature a Korean/China collaboration between their two main leads.

With his 2012 film ""Dangerous Liaisons"", Hur Jin-ho and screenwriter Geling Yan (""Xiu Xiu The Sent-Down Girl"", ""Forever Enthralled"") wanted to do a film inspired by the original French novel but with the setting taking place in Shanghai during the 1930s.  And also continuing a collaboration between Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung (""The Promise"", ""Running on Karma"", ""Shaolin Soccer""), Jang Dong-Gun (""The Promise"", ""The Coast Guard"", ""The Warrior's Way"", ""Tae Guk Gi: Brotherhood of War"") and Chinese actress Zhang Zi Yi (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hero"", ""House of Flying Daggers"").

VIDEO:

""Dangerous Liaisons"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (16:9 widescreen).  The film looks fantastic in HD with skintones that are natural, detail on clothing, hair, vehicles that look amazing.  But it's the close-ups that look stunning, thanks to the performances and style of shots that were taken.  The film looks luxurious, the costume design captures 1930s Shanghai thanks to the amount of research done for the film and the film looks amazing on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Dangerous Liaisons "" is presented in Mandarin DTS-HD 5.1.  For a dramatic film with a lot of dialogue, as one can expect from this film, dialogue is crystal clear from the center/front channels.  Especially the music, including Chinese performances played on stage are clear.  There are moments of crowd ambiance through the surround channels but this is primarily a dialogue-driven film.

Subtitles are in English and Chinese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dangerous Liaisons "" come with the following special features:

  Making of - (16:55) Interviews with the cast of ""Dangerous Liaisons""
  Behind-the-Scenes - (4:57) Behind-the-scene profiles with each of the three main talents: Cecilia Cheung, Jang Dong-gun and Zhang Ziyi.
  Trailers - (6:56) Theatrical trailers for ""Dangerous Liaisons"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Featuring a spectacular performance by Jang Dong-gun, Cecilia Cheung and Zhang Ziyi, ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is a film in which we have never seen these talents take part in before.

While the film reunites ""The Promise"" (2005) talents Korean actor Jang Dong-gun and Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung, the two go farther than they ever have in their performance as Jang Dong-gun as Xie Yifan must make the crowd believe he is the ultimate amoral playboy that would make women's hearts swoon and eventually conquer them.

Cecilia Cheung's performance as Mo Jieyu must portray the role of a powerful woman who never will be conquered.  An amoral woman who loves to control situations and also a woman who knows that she has control over Xie Yifan, the man who has always lusted for her.

And while there have been a good number of film adaptations based on Choderlos de Lacios' ""Les Liaisons dangeruses"", the adaptation of 1930s Shanghai with exquisite costume design, luxurious settings is a sight to be hold.  Both Jang Dong-gun and Cecilia Cheung look as if they belong in that era and they sell the audience of the characters they are portraying, even though these two speak different languages and are from different countries, they make it happen.

For actress Cecilia Cheung, known for taking on comedic, fantasy or feudal-based films, the actress goes all out in playing the vixen. Even smoking all day literally (despite quitting smoking five years ago) in order to play the role, having watched this actress for well-over a decade now, I have to say this is her finest performance yet (considering I have felt her performance on ""Fly Me to Polaris"" as her breakthrough drama acting role).

And as for Zhang Ziyi, she has taken on many roles in her career over the last ten years, but this role required her to be reserved and later emotional, it was a different role for her to play but she also shines in this film.

But ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is a fascinating film for director Hur Jin-ho to take on.  Always known for his love stories, ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is about a man who is the ultimate playboy because he can never have the woman that he really wants, but when he engages in a bet with that woman to conquer the cautious Fenyu, he realizes that he may have discovered his one true love.  But at the same time, he's a man that has long lusted after Mo Jieyu.  Which will he give into... love or lust?

And in an interesting juxtaposition, Mo Jieyu is a woman who doesn't want to love, enjoys being lusted over by Xie Yifan but also not wanting to lose him to any woman.  These characters are fascinating and the way that Hur Jin-ho had ended the film, different from other adaptations, is appropriate and it works quite well.

As for the Blu-ray release, the Blu-ray looks amazing.  Detail of clothing, vehicles to close-ups of the characters are full of detail.  Colors are vibrant and many scenes are well-lit and for the most part, cinematography by Byung-seo Kim is fantastic.  Lossless soundtrack is primarily center and front-channel driven as one would expect from a dialogue driven film with ambiance of crowds being heard in the surrounds when needed.  And as for special features, there are a few, including a making-of that really shows how challenging it was to make the film for the talents involved.

A wonderful Chinese adaptation of the popular French novel, Hur Jin-Ho's ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is sexy, captivating and a fantastic film!",1364601600,6,6130,5.046719681908549

Both Chinese films.  The cinematography is flawless, and beautiful sets make this a highly visual movie. The subtitles are done very well.

5458679,4,B00AN5LCXQ,"Being a huge fan of international cinema as well as a film student myself, I watched this film on dvd and was so impressed with it that I ordered the blu-ray right away. Celicia Cheung has always played a silly, sometimes vulnerable character in many of her films. This is her breakout performance into the big time like actresses Gong Li, Ziyi Zhang, Maggie Cheung, Carina Lau, Michelle Yeoh, Lee Sinje and Karena Lam. Yes, she was good in ""Running on Karma"" co-starring Andy Lau but her performance in ""Dangerous Liaisons"" was incredible, razor sharp and poignant. She is among my favorite actresses after this performance. If you enjoy films like ""In The Mood For Love"", ""Days of Being Wild"", ""Farewell My Concubine"", ""2046"", ""The Banquet"", ""The Emperor and the Assassin"", ""Curse of the Golden Flower"", ""Temptress Moon"", ""Shanghai Triad"" and ""Raise The Red Lantern"" then you will also enjoy ""Dangerous Liaisons"". HIGHTLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1360972800,4,938,5.097402597402597
5458680,5,B00AN5LCXQ,"There is definitely something in Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' ""Les Liaisons dangereuses,"" which has motivated the making of more than one movie version of this 18th century novel. You probably remember ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1988) and ""Valmont"" (1989), two films based on the novel, which were released almost simultaneously years ago. ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is a provocative piece that, if executed well, generates great dividends, which is precisely the case with its brand new and extremely exquisite Chinese version.

If the previous versions of the novel took place in Baroque France, this new installment takes place in 1931 Shanghai. Xie Yifan (Dong-gun Jang) is a rich playboy who enjoys the good life and the company of women, no strings attached. His best friend and confidant is Mo Jieyu (Cecilia Cheung), a beautiful woman who happens to be the one that Xie hasn't been able to sleep with. One day, during a fund-raiser party for political refugees offered by Mo, she tries to convince Xie to seduce a virgin, who is to marry a powerful man in the city. She wants the man to be the laughing stock in Shanghai. Xie discretely declines the offer. However, Mo tries again, and dares Xie to seduce Du Fenyu (Ziyi Zhang), Xie's second cousin and recently widowed from her activist husband. She is serious woman and very hard to impress. If Xie succeeds, Mo agrees to have sex with him. If Mo wins, Xie will give her some valuable land. In the end, both will find the meaning of true love, or, as they say in the film: ""Careful - if you love, you loose.""

This new take of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is truly a delight, well-acted, beautifully photographed, and with awesome production design, reflecting Shanghai during the turbulent 30s. It is sensual, colorful, suspenseful, with some political overtones, and a great jazzy soundtrack. The Blu-ray includes behind-the-scenes and making-of features, and more.

5458681,5,B00AN5LCXQ,"Excellent movie! A great (and rare) opportunity to see the full humanity (love, sex, greed, etc) of another ethnic group, rather than tired stereotypes. As I was watching this movie, I was thinking of how rare it is to see Asian males and females -- together -- loving each other on American television, and this is common as well for all non-white people; blacks, Hispanics.

The cinematography was excellent, the sexuality done tastefully, the ironic humor always beneath the surface, and the acting was superb. I would definitely recommend this movie!",1360627200,6,554,5.087912087912088

5458683,4,B00AN5LCXQ,"I love the original version of Dangerous Liasons because it's kept to the classic French novella but this was quite something. Beautifully filmed with angst, sensuality and the dark character portrayal against China during a time in which the country was under siege creates a juxtaposed concept in storylines. This film lacks the slow undoing of each character as the original film but it captures the essence of how it doesn't matter how fast or slow you can undo a character's values.

5458694,5,B00AN5LCXQ,"This film is a must for all Dangerous Liaisons enthusiasts.  I am always curious as to how many times, and from how many scenarios, this film can be remade.  This Chinese version works except that there is a distinct emphasis placed on Fan's (Viscount Du Valmont) relationship with Fenyu (Mme Du Tourvelle) rather than his relationship with Ms. Mo (Marquise Du Matois).  I think this is a weakness in this version because in the original film most of the cat n mouse play takes place between those two characters.  Jang Dong Gun takes an interesting departure from his usual character type by portraying a womanizer.  However, even in this type of role he still manages to come of as sensitive and somewhat sentimental.  It must be those beautiful eyes!",1420416000,3,753,4.7984496124031

I liked it better than Cruel Intentions, which surprised me. The clothing and scenery are absolutely breath taking. I admittedly cried a few times watching this movie. Xie Yifan comes in as a charming seducer, and you become torn with wanting him to not succeed with the seduction of Du Fenyu and wanting him to succeed so that they can fall in love and live happily ever after. Miss Mo is so completely devious in her scheming, it's actually a little difficult to understand her character, but you can't help but keep watching just to find out what's going to happen next!",1403913600,,731,4.545454545454546
5458703,3,B00AN5LCXQ,"There's a reason that the two wicked leads are played by actors from Hong Kong and Korea as both suffered terribly under the japanese occupation.  And this movie is so loaded with messages while it ignores the japanese terrifying presence in this city under siege.  This is a bad story for Chinese and Koreans because of the designed attacks against the Confucian tribes.  No matter what and it has nothing to do with hallyu, but I believe that Confucianism filled Koreans with light and they embraced it on first contact as I did as if it was simply logical while the goblins took it as an indictment of their very natures including their royal commitment to invest as late as Hirohito's own marriage,

I know what is like to drink the kool aid and I know we were all tracked and punished for it by the nonbelievers.

So you can call shenanigans but it's all intentional.  And Cecelia Cheung's performance is interesting but panned while the praise went to zhang ziyi's muted performance reminiscent of meg tilly's in the same role (I keep thinking the role needs to be recast with Jennifer tilly so she can tear Colin firth a new one).

Basically the message of this popular story is that it takes two to bimbo and that is why this film is set in Shanghai and set during the japanese invasion!

No matter how conservative, nice people understand this and don't blame anyone tattooed with feels hure or vanished into the comfort houses in Shanghai never to be seen again.

This is oblique but not subtle.

And that's how this film will not ring true to Chinese people and that thought will be running through the aucience's minds.  It's not so easy and you have to take responsibility for your actions,  in that sense both female main characters are commendable about wanting what they want and refusing to lie to themselves when presented with the right words but not backed up or wrong words.  VERY dishy re emotional integrity with red herrings supplied by the famous story and the male lead's actions but ultimately we are still safe as houses with one another and it expands the Korean connection distinct and separate while filling out the Chinese as well as the Koreans with this shared emotion  but I still dozed off.",1403913600,,2226,4.645408163265306

5458711,3,B00AN5LCXQ,"I'm convinced, after seeing at least the third adaptation of the novel, that I have to read the source sooner rather than later. It would certainly give me a firmer basis to analyze the many film/stage versions.

This most recent entry, paralleling the impending French Revolution of the original with the Chinese upheavals of the 1930s, is stylish and sensual if off target.  The problem is a script that never flushes out the characters, and acting that is fairly tepid. Cecilia Cheung is essentially non-descript as the conniving Madame Mo, a role that demands a powerful performance (I kept thinking how much better Gong Li would've been, as well as being more age appropriate). Cheung seemed to be too obviously acting instead of owning the character as Glenn Close did. Ditto for Jang Dong-kun as Xie Yifan (the other half of the vicious duo at the heart of the story), who seems to be superficially channeling the suave smirks and mannerisms of Tony Leung as much as anything else. Lastly is Zhang Ziyi, at her misty-eyed best, giving arguably the best performance, yet even hers suffers from a bit of melodrama.  She did however imbue the dumpling scene with a quiet beauty that harkened back to The Road Home. They each had their moments, but the overall effect was stagey, preventing me from every forgetting I was watching a lush period piece and losing myself in the moment.

To that end, it seems as if the director wanted to let style rule over substance, providing us with a fairly empty retelling of the story. It's gorgeous to look at and little else. Mildly recommended to the curious and/or Zhang fans.",1375920000,3,1621,4.7785714285714285

5458713,3,B00AN5LCXQ,"I have no recall of ever seeing any film version of the cited novel, so this is all new to me.

The story is an overrated soap opera; one can see the same sorts of scheming, nastiness, and backstabbing, day in day out, week after week, in daytime US soap operas.  (Not to mention -- except that I do -- in real life.)

Technically, it is no surprise that the film is gorgeous and a flawless print: it was only made ""yesterday"".  But far too much CGI (and why does it always have a blue cast?): all the long shots (of the harbor, as example) seemed to be CGI, as so obviously was the falling snow.

Cecilia Cheung?  Don't know that I've seen her before; not especially impressed.

The male lead?  Meh.  Perhaps Tony Leung had better things to do.  Or the Chinese (and S. Korean, etc.) film industries are overly focused on ""multinational"" productions, and appealing to Western audiences from an unavoidably outside perspective.

The only acting that involved the viewer was that of Zhang Ziyi.  But the film overall seemed cold, uninvolving.

After all the hype, the ""real thing"" is something of a letdown.

The sets were nice -- but the Shanghai of ""Lust, Caution"" was much better.

So far, every We Go USA distribution has been superior, most notably in providing literate subtitles.  It could have done a better job, though, on the ""Making of"" extra.  (The extras are not all that much.)",1372723200,,1389,4.58130081300813
5458714,4,B00AN5LCXQ,"Another remake in yet another foreign location and in different time period, the latest adaptation of Chloderlos de Laclos' 18th century work proves just how powerful, adaptable and universal its sentiments remain, even if this one doesn't particularly have anything new to add to distinguish it from some more adventurous reworkings. At the very least however, Shanghai in the 1930s is a suitably glamorous setting for the decadent affairs of a couple of rich aristocrats and Hur Jin-ho successfully delivers the necessary emotional punch in what is nonetheless an effective, beautiful and stylish version of Dangerous Liaisons.

Korean director Hur Jin-ho's films - April Snow, One Fine Spring Day, Happiness - are well-known for their elements of romance with a bittersweet twist or even a cruel streak, and as such he's a perfect choice for this kind of material. In some respects, with an emphasis on close-ups and in the similarity of choices for certain scenes, the film is quite reminiscent of Stephen Frears' version of Dangerous Liaisons, which has to be the reference point to aspire towards. Hur's Dangerous Liaisons doesn't quite get there, but it is a very stylish adaptation nonetheless, beautifully photographed by Kim Byung-seo (Hur's cinematographer on A Good Rain Knows), every frame suffused in warm golden light. It perhaps owes just as much to Wong Kar-Wai's 2046 (which in a way is a variation on the themes of Dangerous Liaisons), in the period detail, in the music cues that imitate Michael Galasso, and - most evidently - in the pairing of Zhang Ziyi with Jang Dong-gun doing his best Tony Leung impersonation, with slicked back hair and pencil moustache.

Hur Jin-ho's Dangerous Liaisons is a little too glossy and smooth to match the cruelty and tragic circumstances of 2046 or Frears' Dangerous Liaisons. Even though it tries to inject some local period detail into the film through the growing threat of the presence of the Japanese in Shanghai, it's a bit half-hearted and lacks the necessary 'danger' that you'll find in Ang Lee's Lust/Caution. The film nonetheless delivers where it counts, with a strong emotional charge particularly in the crucial, cruel rejection scene of Du Fenyu/Mme de Tourvel by Xie Yifan/Valmont and in head-to-head when Xie Yifan claims his prize from Miss Mo/Merteuil. The performances from the leads are fine throughout, but only Zhang Ziyi is really successful in imprinting her own personality onto these familiar roles, bringing something of the character of her revelatory role in 2046 to the film, and her touching performance makes all the difference.",1372204800,,2618,5.172169811320755

5458718,4,B00AN5LCXQ,"A great plot, this film holds the viewer's attention from beginning to end with a suspenseful  story line, but on top of that the lighting, the setting, the montages, the choice of actors and actresses and the sheer beauty of their bodies in the chiaroscuro of the film are breathtaking.  Artistically, this film is a tour de force. The only reason I gave it a four out of five is because it had English subtitles instead of being dubbed over in  English which I would have found preferable.",1368403200,,491,4.556818181818182

5458720,3,B00AN5LCXQ,"As a Dangerous Liaisons fan who has read the book and watched Cruel Intentions and the previous version of Dangerous Liaisons (1988)several times I had high hopes for this version.  I am not a die hard purist who can't handle variation in adaptations either.  However, the characters were very one dimensional.  They lacked the level of development and personality that is key in this story.  While the story touched on all the main components of the classic written version it didn't develop any of the background of the individual characters in a way that let you get very invested in the ""why"" of what was going on.  The two main characters Xie Yifan (Vicomte de Valmon) and  Mo Jieyu (Marquise de Merteuil) don't have the lively camaraderie in decadence and debauchery that the characters should have in common.  There isn't anything that ""wicked"" about them.  I didn't feel that invested at all in any of the relationships until the final 15 minuets of the movie.  The seduction of Du Fenyu similarly seems fairly flat.  You wonder where her resistance is coming from in the first place.  Then you wonder why it is being broken down with a few cheap interactions.

The actors don't do a terrible job with the scenes they were given and some of the scenes are nice to look at.  Over all I would never watch this again and I am glad I rented, not bought it.",1365120000,,1360,4.616666666666666
5458721,3,B00AN5LCXQ,"A decade ago, it appeared that Zhang Ziyi was the most talented mainland Chinese actress to create international excitement.  I've seen all of her films and either she has poor management or has lost interest in pursuing challenging scripts.  As an American living in China, it appears that most Chinese actresses/pop stars are more interested in being on the cover of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar (e.g. Fan Bingbing) each month and endorsing every product imaginable.  Cecilia Cheung has never  made a good movie.  Gong Li will always reign supreme in talent and has sustained her excellence (with a few exceptions of course) during a 30 year film career.",1364860800,,653,5.0092592592592595
