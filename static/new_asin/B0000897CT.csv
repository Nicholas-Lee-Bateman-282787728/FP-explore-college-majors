1830937,5,B0000897CT,"I was very happy with the movie which is one I saw as a child, now I understood what it really was about! The struggle of a mother and daughter during World War 2, and the young daughter coming of age forcefully.
The service was great from beginning to the end. I even gotten the movie quicker than I thought!
Keep up the great customer service Amazon!!

It's a shame they don't write for women in her age group now. Movie goers today miss a great talent. All I can say is Sophia, Sophia, Sophia.

1830939,5,B0000897CT,"a hugely powerful movie. you have to be ready to watch it, not your 'sunday afternoon' quickie! a very, very young jean paul belmondo -didn't expect him there! love the movie over and over!",1238198400,,189,4.588235294117647
1830940,5,B0000897CT,"When `Le Ciociara' ends, in what may be the most brutal manner possible, one is caught off guard.  We didn't see that coming; but what is remarkable with this particular film is that we should have.  When one goes back through and watches the film, after knowing its devastating finale, you can pinpoint why this ending, why this utter travesty was necessary.

`Le Ciociara' tells the story of Cesira and her beautiful young daughter Rosetta.  During World War II Cesira and her daughter flee from Rome in order to spare their lives and wind up staying in the town where Cesira grew up.  A younger man, Michele, falls in love with Cesira and forms a close bond with her and her daughter.  As the war rages on Cesira and those around her are subject to the cruelty of the soldiers and the inconvenience that comes from hiding.

For the majority of the films running time it feels as though this is all this film is about, and it manages to be very engrossing and very enlightening; but there is much more lurking around the corner.

I won't go into the tragedy that is soon to befall Cesira and her daughter, even though it is a major plot point that has been divulged before and you can easily uncover before watching the film.  I feel that to walk into this film knowing how it ends is a shame and ultimately takes away from the intended feeling delivered by director Vittorio De Sica and his impressive cast.  Walking into `Le Ciociara' blind, so-to-speak, adds to the velocity of the films conclusion, which is a resounding shock to the viewers emotional core.  It challenges all that we think we know about these two women, this mother and her daughter and serves as the moral dilemma with which movies like this thrive.

Sophia Loren made history when she became the first actress to win an Academy Award for a foreign language performance.  Her performance may very well be one of the best in the history of cinema, a truly outstanding and dynamic portrayal of a real woman, trying to give her daughter the best she can, who is destroyed (almost literally) by the realization that she simply cannot do that.  Eleonora Brown, who plays Rosetta, is almost a ghost throughout the film, playing second fiddle to her mother and merely floating in and out of scenes, but as the film plummets towards its conclusion she rises to the occasion and delivers an equally devastating and real performance as her characters world is shattered and her innocence becomes stained with the harsh realities of this world.

`Le Ciociara' is a film that will touch you, that will reach you in a way you may not have expected.  It's stark depiction of the fragile relationship between mother and daughter is disarming, for it is an unexpected peek at a brutal reality.  Superbly done, `Le Ciociara' is a masterpiece.

*I just want to note that I do not own the DVD and thus cannot comment on the quality, which I hear is rather poor.  Please note that this is a review of the film, and the film only.",1236038400,26,2984,4.585687382297552

1830942,1,B0000897CT,"This is one of Sophia Lorens best movies and she's fantastic in it.

Unfortunately the DVD quality is really bad.

The video was grainy and out of focus in many places. Quality reminded me of a bootlegged DVD.

The language is dubbed in english, there is no option for using the original Italian dialog and using english subtitles (there are no subtitle options at all).

Should have known that this DVD quality would be crap...it comes from Alpha Video, well known for selling cheap, low quality DVD's. Wish I had paid closer attention before ordering.

I saw this movie just recently on either AMC or TCM and the picture and sound was fantastic.  I hope that some video company uses that print to put out a quality DVD worthy of this great movie.

FYI: The remastered HD DVD of Lorens ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" that is put out by NoShame films is absolutely fantastic.  The picture and sound quality is the best.  Anyone who has purchased one of the poorer quality DVD's of this movie should get this one and trash their other DVD. Well done NoShame Films, thanks!",1126569600,58,1072,4.62962962962963

1830992,5,B0000897CT,"A stunning Oscar worthy and winning performance by one of the great beauties and actresses of our generation.  Two Women is a study in grief, power, joy, war, humiliation and humanity that is not to be missed.  Sophia Loren portrays Cesira, a widow, and her daughter, Rosetta, played by Eleonora Brown, who leave Rome as the Germans invade Italy in World War II.  Cesira's hometown, high in the mountainous regions of Italy is their destination and along the way they meet refugees from cities and towns across their war ravaged land.  Cesira feels she can better protect them both and Rosetta, especially, from the horrors of war that she would surely have witnessed had they remained in Rome.  Once there she befriends Michele, an intellectual with Communist leaning who is beautifully portrayed by Jean-Paul Belmondo.  Rosetta looks at him as a father figure and Michele, falls in love with Cesira.  German soldiers, looking for a means of escaping the mountains, take Michele hostage and use him as their guide.  As word of the Allied landings and the end of German occupation reaches Cesira, she decides to return to Rome.  What befalls these two women during the journey back to Rome should never be experienced by any woman.  The last part of this film must be seen to truly be appreciated for its depth, its despair, its humanity and earth shattering reality.  This is the performance of a lifetime!  Directed by Vittorio DeSica, the film won no less than 22 international awards for Ms. Loren and film.  The Academy Award given Ms. Loren was the first awarded to an actress in a non-English speaking film!",1431561600,2,1614,4.846715328467154

1831026,4,B0000897CT,"This movie came out when I was a young lady and I remember all of the hype about it.  Frankly, I could not say that I love it because it is the story of a mother and a daughter who are raped during WW II in the countryside when they are trying to escape the bombing going on in Rome.  The portrayal of the rape was devastatingly real.  Had I known it would be so realistic, I don't think I would have purchased the film because of the reaction, mainly, of the 12 year old daughter to the horrible trauma.  It's not a happy movie, but the acting is superb.  If you have a penchant for wanting to see the effects of violence up close and personal, this is the film.  But if you, like me, cannot stand to see such devastation being wreaked on a woman and a child, you'll stay away from it despite the portrayal of the horrors of such a horrific act.  It's also not gift material.",1372032000,2,876,4.087719298245614
1831027,5,B0000897CT,"Like Bicycle Thieves over a decade earlier, Vittorio de Sica's powerful and, at times, heart-wrenching drama Two Women explores the relationship between parent and child, and how far a parent will go to protect his or her family.

Sophia Loren gives a phenomenal performance, worthy of the Academy Award she won, with an emotional range and intensity I have never seen from her. Her acting flows from stern authority to bleak desparation with an authenticity that is difficult to achieve, yet she does so in a way that makes it look easy.

Granted, much of that is due to de Sica's neorealistic filmmaking. Again, similar to Bicycle Thieves, we are given a snapshot of Italy at a specific time and place, rich with all the politics and people we would expect in that era. For a director so in control as de Sica certainly was, it sure doesn't feel like it; there is nothing cinematic-feeling about this film, which really does place us in the midst of the action without hyper stylized techniques to distract from the narrative.

This subdued method of filmic enunciation makes the characters that much more accessible. When tragedy befalls the three leads, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Sophia Loren, and her daughter, we are truly heartbroken; we shared in these experiences with them, and we share their pain.

De Sica's masterpiece Two Women takes audiences through all the cruelty and pain of war, and meets it with the strength humanity embodies even in the face of desperation. This is a wonderful film that illustrates the power of love and family when all else is lost.",1371168000,3,1568,4.861423220973783
