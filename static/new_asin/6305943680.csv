7898604,5,6305943680,"I LOVE Kimiko!  I wrote to her in Japan and got an autographed picture back in 1994!  She's awesome and has such a creamy and beautiful voice!  I first discovered her on an old Columbia Jazz sampler from 1987.  Her version of Jobim's ""Dindi"" appears on that compilation.  I was so blown away by the beauty of her voice that I bought her first two American releases on CBS/Sony, ""For Lovers Only"" and ""Follow Me.""  After that, she disappeared but resurfaced again in 1994 with ""Sophisticated Lady.""  She is billed as the ""#1 Female Jazz Vocalist in Japan,"" but I suspect she's probably the ONLY ONE, which is a GOOD THING!  After watching this DVD, I feel that much more connected to the face/voice behind the music that touched my heart over twenty years ago!",1279670400,,759,4.57037037037037
7898605,5,6305943680,Kimiko Itoh is a hidden Japanese jazz treasure........This girl can really sing. With an able Japanese/american trio she makes beautiful music. Buying this Dvd will not disappoint if you are a lover of jazz vocalizing like this writer..........,1249516800,,244,5.447368421052632
