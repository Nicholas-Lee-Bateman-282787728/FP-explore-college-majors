7852379,4,6303632734,"I thought this video was very analytical on the song Crazy Train, and it goes through Randy's solo with a lot of detail.  Other Ozzy fans like me would have appreciated a broader selection of Randy's songs to examine.  Some of the brilliance of the songs from ""Diary Of A Madman"" are  left out, but the video was very cool anyway!  OZZY RULES!!!",935884800,4,345,4.428571428571429
7852380,4,6303632734,"Very detailed video that not only talks about Randy's playing style but the equipment he used to get his sound.  Goes through the song ""Crazy Train"" in detail.  Spends a lot of time on writing/reading tab.",912643200,4,205,4.666666666666667
