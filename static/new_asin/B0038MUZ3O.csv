4088812,3,B0038MUZ3O,"It's getting to a point that the straight to dvd movies are cutting corners skimping on the ingredients... I really like the movie the cast is potent, it has star power The script had bite but needed more tweaking by the director... It was the picture quality, the studio sets and the lighting that mumbled (low budget)... The actors came, the conquered.., But the picture quality of movies like love & basketball, Brothers,Soul food has set the bar real high... One scene, the club or party was to dark.., The shower scene was smoking but the set looked B-list... Another thing in regard to the Amazon dvd venders they'll learn the same lesson the Blockbusters and Hollywood video franchises learned... Your ""over charging"" the customers.... There must really be in market for the out of control or desperate buyer...",1278892800,6,818,4.892086330935252

4088815,5,B0038MUZ3O,"A nice movie that makes you fall in love again...feel good movie!  Christian K is always a nice piece of eye candy to watch.  The atheletic trainer was extremely funny.  The line about the black man dating the white girl could use some more acting lessons.  The storyline was interesting and the chemistry between the couples was great.  Kind of reminded you of coming to America but with a twist. It is a must BUY, WATCH, and tell a friend to do the same. Make you believe in finding the Perfect Combination to unlocking the doors to your perfec mate.",1275523200,,552,4.48

4089166,3,B0038MUZ3O,"I enjoyed the movie but did not like the foul language.  The explicit language was too excessive for me to really enjoy this type of story line.

4089281,5,B0038MUZ3O,"Although this is a story that's been done many times it's still a very cute movie.  Essence Atkins and Christian Keyes are very good together and their ""relationship"" makes for some funny dialog.  The supporting cast members were all pretty good as well, especially veteran actors Lynn Whitfield and Glenn Turman.  The young woman who plays Essence's sister was also very good, the guy who plays her fiance - not so much.  All in all it was an sweet, funny, enjoyable movie.  I would recommend it to friends and family.",1382054400,,519,4.722222222222222

Christian Keyes makes for nice ""eye candy,"" script lacking depth, and the ""low-budget"" quality of the photography is apparent...",1379894400,,199,5.451612903225806
4089283,3,B0038MUZ3O,"And I did chuckle at several lines and scenes. I thought the script had potential...several more re writes would have only helped...character development is important and ""Lia"" and ""Jamal"" characters suffered because of the lack there of...When on a budget, most important people to hire...attract...bribe, whatever you have to do lol: person who has lights and knows how to light, a skilled DP and an editor with natural intuitions regarding when/how to cut scenes, include music and a higher skill level to fix the audio, blah, blah, blah. A few homemade bounce boards...a three point lighting book, detailed story boards for shot selections - ANYTHING to help with the qualitative look and feel to the film and script that was well on it's way.... I enjoyed the performances of C Keyes, D Wilson,  K Grimes and A Lexi. And it was nice to see A Conwell doing her thing. Like I said, enjoyable, it was just one of those movies where you wish more time, detail, creative budgeting, script and overall creative thoughtfulness were implemented. Good effort though!",1376006400,,1062,4.966292134831461

Good movie, I definitely recommend it.  :-)",1370563200,,345,5.277777777777778
4089289,5,B0038MUZ3O,Perfect Combination was  a very funny and  interesting movie. I am really good at deciphering movies and this movie had a little spin on it. The movie gives you a storyline that should wow the women and  keep the men interested. I only wish that Johnny Gill could of had more air time. But Christian Keyes did his thing in the movie. Must see,1368662400,,342,4.3125
4089290,5,B0038MUZ3O,Funny story on how I became a Christian Keyes fan.  : ) I watched it because I wanted to see more of him. I loved the movie because it is hard to find someone special. It seems like the more you try the worst it gets. I really loved the relationship he had with his friends because good friends are also hard to come by. I do believe that you find love where you least expect. Thumbs up! You all we're great!!!,1367366400,,410,4.0

It ended to abruptly.  Could have been tweaked a little more to end the movie out better than it did.  Otherwise, it was a good comedy movie.",1348099200,,297,4.068965517241379
4089338,2,B0038MUZ3O,"The movie is ok. It has some funny scenes especially the different dates that the main character had but the story is kind of all over the place. I do not see the point of the love scene between the two friends since they did not end up together anyways. I thought that the ending was too abrupt. And also, they talk about finding a proverbs 31 woman but this movie is filled with Sinful acts. Overall, I would not recommend to buy this movie maybe just rent it!!!",1346630400,2,464,4.224719101123595

Maybe I'm biased because i'm a christian keyes fan but what can i say :-)...and he is actually a talented actor (and singer/songwriter)! its a feel good movie. you root for the characters. I thought it was funny and cute. i understand what others say about the ""low budget"" but i didn't think it was that bad at all and Mr Keyes acting is always natural to me.

4089343,4,B0038MUZ3O,"I had low expectations for this movie, but it exceeded my expectations. The acting was surprisingly good to me (better than the acting in ""N-Secure"" though people raved about that mediocre movie). Some of the lines were pretty hilarious. The four main characters seemed to have pretty good chemistry, although it was weird that the girl best friend was apparently attracted to two of her male best friends. That seemed to be overkill.

The movie didn't seem as ""low budget"" as I expected. I like that it wasn't overly sexy (just one sex scene, not too much kissing). If it weren't for the the abrupt ending, I would have given this movie 5 stars. It ended suddenly and at an awkward time, without giving closure to the characters' love lives. The plot also got a bit long-winded and some parts seemed pointless.

Overall I really enjoyed the movie. Interesting plot. Good acting. Good characters. Funny.",1308960000,,903,4.819354838709677

Unless you have NOTHING else to do....you should avoid wasting your time if you're in search  of an actual motion picture and/or looking for any hint of a plot, script & acting. Even when I wished that it would - nothing in this film made sense. Even the predictable scenes were unexpectedly awkward.  Just fast forward to the CREDITS.....these by far are the funniest part of this flick...although even then....the ENDING was sudden. I gave it a 2 for a few funny lines by the supporting actors.....",1301270400,5,544,4.9021739130434785
4089345,1,B0038MUZ3O,"This movie is horrible!!! What a waste of money and of my time. First off the previews made it appear as if it was about a man looking for a ""Proverbs 31:30"" woman and it was nothing of the sort! Then they use Christian Keyes who was a actor in many of Tyler Perry plays so I immediate thought this was a Christian friendly movie. A movie based on nothing but LUST! Dont waste your money. 0 out of 5 popcorn bags for me. SMH",1290816000,13,424,4.0
4089346,4,B0038MUZ3O,I really enjoyed this movie. It was a light hearted comedy which really addressed some very common issues many black men and women face everyday in the dating world.,1288656000,,165,4.724137931034483
4089347,3,B0038MUZ3O,"This was an interesting movie. I probably wouldn't have spent as much as I did but, I did enjoy it. There were some funny parts and, it was a typical dating movie. Not very original though. However, I would watch it more than once. The main reason I purchased the movie was because of Christian Keyes so, I truly enjoyed his acting. I also saw Terrell Carter and, Tiffany Hines played her part very well. Overall I would give it 3 stars.",1283558400,,437,4.341463414634147
4089348,1,B0038MUZ3O,"Unwatchable. Amateurish acting, editing, dialogue. Looks and sounds like a home movie. Awful in every way.",1282003200,4,106,5.6875
4089349,2,B0038MUZ3O,"In a nutshell: this flick has all the shortcomings of late night cable tv soft-core porn, with none of the advantages.

The long form: everything about this movie screams ""BUDGET!"": hack writing [seriously, I could've written better dialog, & I'm as Wonderbread as they come!], super tight camera angles (to disguise the fact that they were shooting all the exteriors on the same street w/o having to hassle w/ permitting perhaps?), mid-70s monoaural sound quality, casting unknowns, etc. etc.

As far as I'm concerned, the only reason to own this movie is so you can see how far Tiffany Hines outshines the material she was given; I expect to see her become a big star! All the other talent turn in decent performances too, but they're really held back by the material they were given: Ms. Hines has the ability to take what she's given & run with it, regardless.

The only way to save this dog would be if there'd been more skin, as it is, the story & characters aren't very believable, the pacing is poor, and the direction is so marginal it intrudes upon the story.",1281830400,18,1069,4.645502645502646

8391482,2,B0038MUZ3O,"I certainly did not expect a rush to throw characters together at the end.  Undeniable chemistry with Tiffany (Lia) and Christian (Rick), they even ventured to exploring this potential.  It felt promising.  Shortly, they were tossed aside in the least dramatic way.  At the very end, at Rick's 30th, you see these mix-matched, forced pairings, the epitome of a cold bucket of water on what could have been a decent flick.  Budget should never be the excuse for terrible writing or trying to be interesting by doing unimaginable soap opera-esque plot twists in two hours.  Just ridiculous!!!  If this was a book I would have given it ""one star"" but because aside from the forced pairings at the end, the friendship between the leads was palpable.",1516060800,,745,4.865079365079365
