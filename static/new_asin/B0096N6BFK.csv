8536763,5,B0096N6BFK,"I bought this historical version mainly to see how it compares to the later releases.  Amazing how little has been changed over the years.  If you like this ballet then this is a performance worth having in your collection.  What is, as always, fascinating, is to see how the ability of dancers has changed - especially the men.  David Blair was dancing at just about the time English fans (and the male dancers) were stunned by the ability of Nureyev and it's easy to see why Rudy came as such a shock.  Nadia Nerina is funny and sweet as Lise.  Stanley Holden, the original clog dancing Widow Simone is the gold standard.  Overall I'm glad I bought it",1448064000,,653,4.483050847457627
8536764,5,B0096N6BFK,Ashton's delicious ballet performed by its original cast (Nadia Nerina and David Blair) upon whose bodies the work was created and who have never been surpassed.  A treasure--even in its dated black and white format.,1438819200,,216,5.171428571428572
8536765,5,B0096N6BFK,"It is such a pleasure to see this ballet danced by the people it was created on. Nadia Nerina and David Blair are both impressive dancers and charming actors; although today's super-athletes can outperform them in a purely technical sense, this is a generation of dancers who understood how to use choreography to communicate.  I can only hope that more productions of both the Royal Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet (many of which were televised in the 1950's and 1960's) will find their way onto dvds so that modern audiences can appreciate their historical and artistic contributions. Stanley Holden and Alexander Grant are wonderful comic performers in this comedy - Grant was still dancing this part when I first saw FILLE years later!",1383436800,2,742,4.983870967741935
8536766,5,B0096N6BFK,"This disc surprised me.  I thought that being in black and white would be disappointing--however it seemed to have its own ambience that did not take away from the performance.  Very early in the disc, I began to smile and laugh out loud and this persisted throughout the entire performance, including the name credits at the end--which if you see it, you will understand why, again, I laughed out loud.  David Blair was a very strong and likeable alpha male dancer. Nadia Nerina is thechnically exquisite and sooooo cute, albeit she is slightly older than some prima ballerinas. but her mannerisms are very charming and her proportions are just about perfect. The entire production was staged for TV and it is beautiful..The preformance that could rival this one for sheer joy and good humor is the splenidid Australian Ballet production with  a vibrant David MacAllister as Colas and the exceengly lovely Fiona Tonkin as Lise.  I would not be without either one.  There are three other versions of which I am aware.  There are two others with the Royal ballet that do not convey the sheer joy of dance to the extent of of my two favorites. however they are technicallly superb.  The other is with the Basler Ballet, which is surprisingly good.  This performance has little resemblence to Ashton's choreography.  The musice is quite different, too,even though it is by the same composer.

Overall this is a truly enjoyable disc and I recommend it to anyone.",1358294400,2,1458,4.862348178137652
