3031942,5,6304966938,"I love this movie, it classic old style kung fu movie. This film has it all intrigue, humor and well choreographed fight sequences. The actor are some of the best Yuen Biao, Ching-Ying Lam  and Sammo Hung.  The ""Prodigal Son""  show Wing Chun in a most realistic light, i.e. it has its weakness as explained by Sammo Hung.  Highly recommend for all lovers of kung fu movies.",1484524800,,373,4.522388059701493

3031945,5,6304966938,"A classic kung-fu masterpiece from director sammo hung. Yuen biao plays a rich and spoiled kid who wins his fights because his parents are always paying the losers. When he find the truth,
he joins a opera team with lam ching-ying hoping to learn wing chun. After a while, his master teaches him and it all comes down to an amazing 5-minutes final fight against franckie chan who killed his master a bit earlier. IT's old school kung-fu at his best and the training sequences are impressive.",1006560000,,491,4.655172413793103

8233305,4,6304966938,"A very solid martial arts movie.  Cultural norms aside, many will find the overly stylistic characters (giant warts, downright cartoonish behavior) and over the top comedy as a deterrents.  Hopefully, not enough to miss the movie.  Fights are amazingly choreographed, and the fighters are interesting and charismatic.  The movie does interesting things with characters in general.  The main master is a female impersonator in the Chinese Opera, and is probably one of the move unique and interesting characters I've watched lately.

I've read a lot of hype regarding the training sequences, but found them to be one of the weaker points of the movie. He basically fights his teachers, and becomes an amazing fighter in, what seems like days, simply by getting the tar beat out of him.",1522886400,,784,5.0859375
8233306,5,6304966938,"I'm really surprised it took me so long to find out about this movie.  This is a great kung fu movie that really shows some of the ins and outs of wing chun as I understand it.  Decent plot, great humor, excellent choreography.  The film is well directed.  Only complaint would be the dubbing.",1515196800,,293,4.37037037037037
8233307,5,6304966938,"My only complaint is there is only the dubbed English version instead of the Chinese with English subtitles version. This movie is even better with the original Chinese dialogue, the English dub loses a lot and makes the movie more cornball then it should be at times. Still, this is one of the GREATEST martial arts movies ever made!!! Thanks to Amazon for adding it for Prime members. If you ever get around to adding the Chinese version, you'll make many customers, including myself, very happy.",1500940800,,498,4.8023255813953485
8233308,5,6304966938,"Awesome movie! Wasn't really expecting much, but this movie did impress me. I think you should watch and make your on judgements.",1497312000,,129,4.909090909090909
8233309,5,6304966938,"Great movie with excellent directing by Hung Kam-bo (Sammo Hung). The fact that it is loosely based on the martial exploits of Yip Man's Grandmaster Leung Jan is sort of refreshing. Considering around this time, most movies of the era consisted of the Hung Fist expert; Wong Fei Hung with various interpretations of him and his story. Risky, however, I believe it paid off.",1494201600,,373,4.84375
8233310,5,6304966938,"This is one of the coolest martial art films I have seen. The story may be iffy but we come here for the fights, and this delivers some of the best fights you'll ever see on film! Very enteraining and worth a watch!",1493164800,,215,4.023255813953488

8233312,5,6304966938,"Original in every sense; my Sifu suggested this movie and after viewing I understand why. The fight scenes, that is, the actual fight scenes utilizing Wing Chun and Hung Gar are beyond excellent. That is my real reason behind watching the film, but the plot is great as well as the humor all thanks to Sammo Hung. Honestly, this is top tier--definitely within the top five best kung fu movies I've ever seen.",1486512000,,408,4.602739726027397
8233313,5,6304966938,I love this movie. It reminds me of The Big Boss by Bruce Lee; the hit movie in early 70'.,1486252800,,90,3.55
8233314,4,6304966938,"Not a typical kung fu movie where the main character is able to rip through opponents.  In this one, he has his challenges.",1486166400,,123,4.3478260869565215
