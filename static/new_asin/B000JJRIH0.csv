2674998,5,B000JJRIH0,"Great point, and great humor.  Ken davis is a master at using humor to make a needed point, and make it memorable.",1361491200,,114,4.181818181818182
2674999,3,B000JJRIH0,Saw Ken Davis in person and was far more impressed than this DVD. Almost seemed like they dug up archival performances to market after Mr. Davis became more well known.,1356480000,,168,4.633333333333334
2675000,5,B000JJRIH0,"This came in good time, wrapped well, and it is absolutely wonderful!
Ken Davis is a very funny, motivational speaker, and here he tells
the story of Moses and the burning bush in a way that will make your
sides ache with laughter",1354060800,,230,4.372093023255814
2675001,5,B000JJRIH0,"The DVD arrived just as it was promised - and VERY quickly!  I have not watched the DVD yet, but I am sure that everything will be in working condition.  Thanks!!!",1330387200,,163,4.225806451612903
2675002,4,B000JJRIH0,"This DVD is a good message, focusing on Moses' excuses and hesitation to do the job God called him to do.  Ken Davis is famous for his comedy with a Christian message interwoven into his comedy.  In this case, it is more of a message with comedy interwoven into it.  In other words, there is less comedy in this DVD than in most other Ken Davis DVDs.

For some folks who find other Ken Davis DVDs contain too much comedy, this is the DVD for them.  For those of us who are into deep Bible study and looking for more comedy relief, we might prefer his other DVDs.",1255478400,,562,4.166666666666667
2675003,5,B000JJRIH0,"GODLY ENTERTAINMENT- GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT-  FUNNY- BUT MY FAV IS STILL ""SUPER SHEEP"" .  THIS IS DEF WORTH THE PURCHASE.",1244764800,,118,5.157894736842105
2675004,5,B000JJRIH0,"Ken has appeared in several comedy videos.  ""A Wimpy Prophet,"" is actually a sermon but not like any sermon you've ever heard.  Lots of side splitting humor, fantastic insights and the best in inspiration.  I love all of his comedy and preaching videos but this one is my favorite (although Super Sheep isn't far behind).  Keep them coming Ken.  We need your fresh approach.  You prove what Drs. are now finding out...laughter is good for you.  For your body or your soul, this video is a great prescription.",1208217600,3,508,4.704545454545454

8151416,5,B000JJRIH0,"What can I say about this, other than this is the fifth copy of Wimpy Prophet I've bought. I keep giving them away to others in need of inspiration and humorous entertainment. One of his best.",1462924800,,192,4.361111111111111

8151419,5,B000JJRIH0,Soo THRILLED I bought this ~ It was truly a Fabulous CD - every bit of what I expected of Ken Davis and more. I definitely will be buying more of his CD's in the future!!!!,1428364800,,172,3.8055555555555554

8151422,5,B000JJRIH0,"I feel the best way to teach children, teens and adults is with a little humor and Ken Davis is so good that my family wants to watch it over and over.  They wish he had a TV show!",1398643200,,180,3.6153846153846154
8151423,2,B000JJRIH0,Love Ken Davis!!!!!!!  His first video we purchased - Living Life - was fantastic!!!!!  We went ahead and purchased the Wimpy Prophet despite the reviews.  We also were disappointed and would not recommend this one.,1396915200,,215,5.085714285714285
8151424,5,B000JJRIH0,Love Ken Davis' view of Exodus 3... Moses used all of the excuses we try to use everyday... God puts them all to rest in this entertaining look at the Old Testament.,1380240000,,165,4.1875
