7951945,5,B00005R85N,"FRONTLINE'S stellar presentation, AMBUSH IN MOGADISHU, was released a few years following that harrowing event. It is, to this very day, remembered for the miscommunications found at the top levels of the Department of Defense and at the Department of State, and for the wholly unnecessary loss of life of nineteen young men. The story itself is yours to discover, and I am loathe to give up the whole story, but clear as crystal now as it was then, that a new administration, and one known to have no great affinity for the US Military, making freshman errors of communication between itself and members of the military, was the primary cause of this unnecessary bloodbath.

Only hours away from beginning what was to be a rather quick and simple exercise of repelling down into a city center and taking into custody a wanted fugitive, conversations between the wanted man, Mohamed Farrah Adid, and members of the administration were taking place. Could the operation have been delayed while the negotiations were ongoing? Should those in charge of taking Aidid by force have been notified of this ongoing conversation? . . and knowing such information, might they have delayed the operation, thereby saving the lives of 19? Not one single aforementioned consideration was brought to Anthony Lake or the President before, during, or after the massacre in Somalia.

The story itself is told by seven or eight men who managed to live survive. They tell their own stories with remarkable honesty, clarity, passion, and, in one or two cases, gallows' humour. Those chosen to tell the story are so few enough in number that we begin to feel that we know them. At with that familiarity, the matter itself begins to matter that much more. Over the course of the 36 hours they ran and hid and fired their way to spots of momentary safety, you also come to think of these young men--some 19, 20, as the genuine heroes they truly are.

The mission itself was not a victorious one, although one might disagree with that assessment when the mission changed, and became one of survival. That very mission was a remarkable success. A charge exploiting the primary virtues of the Rangers, including caring for the man beside you, just as he would do for you.

IF YOU DO WANT TO PURCHASE THIS FRONTLINE DOCUMENTARY, it is absolutely essential that you purchase the VHS copy. The original story lives there, and not on the perfectly adulterated DVD updated copy. By updating the finest Frontline documentary made, all that was added--nonsense about 9-11 that had nothing at all to do with this action--meant much had to be removed. The careless editing undermined the effectiveness of the original release, but, much more significantly, removed the very important conclusions made by the Rangers, themselves--should they not have a summary of sorts? . . and the father of one of the Rangers that did not survive the Somali attack. His comments are most illuminating, and reflect the brief chat he had with Tony Lake and President Clinton on the very day the military buried his son with full honours.

Assuming two items sporting the same title, subject matter, et al, and the only difference being that one was a storage upgrade to DVD, I was rather sickened to find that the VHS copy and DVD had nothing in common save the title, which was, to my mind, a gross example of misinformation. The changes were clearly of a political nature--manufactured lies put together by a member of the Frontline executive staff who chose to protect those responsible for the death of nearly 20 Rangers, choosing misinformation over truthful documentation.

The disc went the way of the bin, as I resolved to continue watching my VHS copy as the only genuine story of the Ambush in Mogadishu. If the truth matters to you, if the US military, and all for which they stand matters to you, see the version not picked clean of political facts; purchase the VHS version of this program: AMBUSH IN MOGADISHU.",1369180800,2,3971,4.840942562592047
7951946,2,B00005R85N,"This was obviously made after the OCT 2001 military operation in Afganistan  began since it showed live film/video of the parachuting and other airborne operations into AFganistan.

  I keep hearing that the original broadcast in 1998 had more discussion of the Clinton involvement of the Somalia debacle, implying it was removed by PBS to cover the Clinton administrations you-know-what.  I had video taped the original broadcast in 1998 but accidentally taped over it.  DANG!!!!  Does anyone out there have the original broadcast on home video?",1318204800,4,546,5.352941176470588
