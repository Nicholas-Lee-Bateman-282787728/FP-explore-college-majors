8542570,5,B009KO7IRA,"An anthology of 6 different stories of different styles connected by a loosely unifying thread about a Blogger who debunks or verifies mostly supernatural events.  Two episodes are done by 2 different directors and the other 4 stand apart particularly in production values and acting. These pay off the through line in the final episode when the hunted becomes the hunter.  These 4 shows show creativity and boast very good performances by major actors in those 4 very different stories.  Overall, though uneven, the good qualities of the best ones make this show very worthwhile for shorter entertainment and unique chills. It has  a Twilight Zone quality.",1464825600,,657,5.11214953271028
8542571,1,B009KO7IRA,this sounded interesting but I really would like to have my money back.  can't believe they actually make something this bad.,1394755200,,125,4.9523809523809526
8542572,3,B009KO7IRA,"Dominic Monaghan as a hermit blogger investigates tales of the supernatural and bizzare.  This is an anthology(over 2hrs.)of stories loosely tied together by a single thread that reaches the conclusion.  Though there are a few risque scenes, the some of its' parts pay homage to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and Rod Serling.  For the most part each individual tale(six)is well crafted and dosen't over stay its' welcome.  Various cast and crew are fans of classic horror and deliver varied results.  The overall feel is creepy!  Worth a dark rainy night rental!",1362355200,,562,5.054347826086956
8542573,4,B009KO7IRA,Enough with the summaries already G wiz! It me n ot even want to purchase anything else seeing that I always have to rate and write.,1358467200,,132,4.115384615384615
8542574,5,B009KO7IRA,"This movie is awesome! I love,love,love horror movies.  This has a little if everything.  It reminds me of tales from the crypt and twilight zone.  It has a lot of little movies within a larger movie. Definitely worth seeing and I will definitely buy this one!",1351987200,,260,4.608695652173913
8542575,1,B009KO7IRA,"If I was Dom, I would be more careful about getting involved in laughable productions such as this one.  As much as I wanted to like it, I couldn't.  I ended up turning it off at the human meat story.  The visuals and acting look about on par with a college freshman project.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  The scariest thing about this flick is the fact that you'll never get those minutes of your life wasted back....and I say minutes because I'm all but certain it'll be all you can stand of this abomination.",1351468800,2,522,4.285714285714286
8542576,3,B009KO7IRA,"What connects these tales is the presence of a blogger played by Monaghan.  He investigates weird cases and then finds out just how much was true, often with horrying information revealed.  I could have done without the human meat story, but the one at the end called ""privacy settings"" was spot-on in tension and resolution.",1350172800,2,325,4.890909090909091
8542577,1,B009KO7IRA,"I just made myself watch the entire two hours, or six episodes, of roughly twenty minutes each.  I did this so nobody could tell me later that it got better right at the end.  It didn't.  Thankfully the rental was free, and after watching the first vignette I decided to watch it all in one sitting while my wife was asleep, so at least I didn't inflict it on anybody else.

The problems are multiple.  First, the production values would have been acceptable in the 1970's, and alright in the 1980's.  Needless to say, it's over 20 years later.  That can be forgivable, with crisp direction, good acting, and solid scripts.  Plus, given the very short nature of each plot, a determined effort at coherency is necessary if you want to make this work, and that's very tricky.

The second problem is that all you have connecting the six chapters is a single, possibly obsessive blogger, Mark Nickel (played by Dominic Monaghan) who posts on the weird and the occult.  He evidently lives and works out of a small, dingy, somewhat messy apartment where individuals with stories contact him in person, by cell phone, or whatever the de rigueur method is for that episode.  While this can be used very cleverly as a plot device, here it is not.

Only one episode uses this plot device coherently, and even then due to the short duration of the episode, it devotes less than two minutes at the end to making any real interaction with the blogger.  I timed it.  Rod Serling's introductions for Twilight Zone or Night Gallery were more interesting, better written, and mercifully shorter than the blogger scenes here.

You cannot exactly fault the actors.  You have six different episodes with 3 separate directors and 5 different writers.  It really shows.  Again, if they were done well, you could at least feel like you were watching a genre oriented screening of the projects of a group of skilled film school students.  Instead, the two best episodes MIGHT have been turned into the passable episodes of some Twilight Zonesque series.  The other four fall to mediocrity to just plain awful, with endings that don't really bother to look at the implications of the rest of the episode.  The one think I dislike worse than mediocre scripts is mediocre scripts with pathetic endings.

I cannot really critique the actors here, as there is simply almost nothing to work with.  I understand the need to pay the bills, and since the series is so forgettable hopefully any of them with genuine talent won't see their careers harmed.  If this was at 1AM back in the days of broadcast only television, when nothing else was on except reruns of old Westerns, Monster Movies, et al you might have stayed tuned in out of simple boredom.

There are so many new quality fantasy, horror, and SF series that watching this is simply pointless.  If you really want to watch some decent, short tales of the weird just pop in an old Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, or even a Tales of the Crypt episode.  You could also go online and stream many of the excellent anime series that deal with the genre.  Whichever way you go, you'll have a much higher entertainment quotient.",1350000000,3,3145,4.689781021897811
