It was a real treat to go to the movie's premier and see our contributions to the project.  Side note - mutual friend Luis Pimber was also introduced to Ben, and through Ben was able to launch his own budding cinematic career.",1405209600,,402,4.128205128205129

8248653,5,B001302UNG,"La Venganza is the first in a series of movies that up and coming director Ben Lopez is producing in the Old Pueblo.  The Tucson-based film production studio aims to put Southern Arizona on the map of stars as VientoFuego Productions releases the potential inside the treasure chest of beauty that characterizes the Sonoran desert.

La Venganza was created on a budget that would be impossible for any other studio to work with.  The result is a multi-layered film that pleases the more action-oriented audiences, while the film buffs will find the psychological dilemma thought-provoking with its venture into the depths of one of man's most carnal instincts, the desire for revenge.
