8002627,1,B0000TI3R8,"I bought this product but I had to return it because of its specification.  It seems this DVD is for Zone 2 (Europe) because I could not use it in my DVD Player which was bought here in the US.  The seller should specify this condition in the description of the product to avoid the problems associated with returning a product.  I had not returned a product before this DVD and sometimes you do not have time to do this so I prefer to avoid this as much as possible.  If I see this DVD available for my region (USA), I would buy it.",1205107200,9,533,4.096153846153846
