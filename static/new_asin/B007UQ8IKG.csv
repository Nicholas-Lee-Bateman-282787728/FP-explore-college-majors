5110431,5,B007UQ8IKG,"Every so often you come across a movie that you've never heard of that turns out to be an absolute gem- this is one such movie. Dom is a sad sack who works as the night manager in a small hotel. We first meet him as he's bicycling to work, in the rain, on a bike that keeps throwing its chain. His life is one of small pleasure- a few undisturbed minutes during which he can enjoy his sandwich and an old movie. But such moments are hard to come by, as he finds himself repeatedly interrupted by curious travelers and an odd woman who appears at the door without any luggage, announces that she is a fairy, and grants him three wishes. Fiona- that's the fairy's name- doesn't look like anyone's conception of a fairy- but Dom is startled to discover his first two wishes come true, and that's when things start to get even stranger.

But to say things get strange is an understatement. The plot is really just a tenuous thread that ties together moments of comedy, dance, and music. The team of Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, who both wrote and star in The Fairy, are dancers, mimes, and performers who have collaborated for many years, both personally and artistically, and this film showcases both their wit and originality and their great physical skill- though in a way unlike anything you may have seen before. Like all great comedies, The Fairy is completely original, with characters and a plot that is like nothing you've ever seen in a movie, and that means that every scene, every turn of events is completely unexpected. I loved it, and if you can imagine liking a comedy that can be described as sweet, surreal, and completely original, you might just like it too.",1345939200,15,1678,4.537953795379538
5110432,4,B007UQ8IKG,"Once again the performing/writing and directing team of Abel, Gordon, and Romy deliver a sweet, gentle, charming comedy, that while having dialogue, is most akin to the silent
comedy classics.

As with their earlier films ""L'iceberg"" and ""Rumba"", the film is a hit and miss affair - but with many more hits than misses. A long string of silly sight gags, dances, absurd
and surreal moments with a slim thread of a plot tying them together; A sad-sack hotel manager falls for a woman who may be an actual fairy. Or just a crazy person.
Or maybe both.

Along their way they encounter a host of mostly very funny characters, like the nearly blind-owner of their favorite cafe, who is always right at the edge of spilling everything. (One of those
jokes that could fail badly, or get old quickly if it wasn't pulled off with such deft precision, and big heartedness.)

There are a few inspired, laugh out loud comedy bits, many others that are sweetly enjoyable, and a few that just fall flat.

But while this may be a bit inconsistent, how lovely to see a comedy that aspires to Chaplin and Keaton and not American Pie 5.",1345248000,,1118,4.575
5110433,5,B007UQ8IKG,"This is funny movie with lots of physical comedy and some great dancing scenes too.  It is a goofball comedy about a low end hotel clerk, whose mundane life changes significantly when one day an unusual guest checks in - she claims to be a fairy.  Her name is Fiona and she offers to grant him three wishes.  His first wish is to get a scooter, and his second wish is to get free gas for life (how so European!).  But before he has a chance to ask for his last wish, Fiona disappears and the real adventure starts.  Story is so well thought out and characters are believable in spite of the fairy tale premise.

I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  Film does not loose the beat at all.  Both main actors: Dom and Fiona are amazing.",1344211200,,738,4.2214285714285715
5110434,5,B007UQ8IKG,"This is a small pearl of a film - crossing through ballet, wordless acting, strange figures, peculiar storyline, wonderful acting and very memorable. It is full of humour and aesthetics - a different film experience - in a good way. It was like a blind date for me when I went to the movies to see this film - and I was pleasantly surprised. Just sit back and let yourself enjoy - highly recommended.

About the film:
""Dom is a night watchman at a small hotel in Le Havre, France. One night the mysterious Fiona appears, shoeless and without any luggage. She tells him she is a fairy and that he can have three wishes come true. The next day two of them are fulfilled and Fiona has disappeared. But Dom really wants to find her as she has opened a new world to him, a world crowded by fantasy and love.""",1338249600,30,803,4.282894736842105
5110435,5,B007UQ8IKG,My wife and I saw this move at the theatre and thought it was the craziest movie ever. It is almost a silent film - a lot of physical comedy - a lot a small clever details - and romance. There are a few times when you are sure what is going to happen next but it doesn't happen. Something else heppens instead.,1335657600,24,310,3.9365079365079363
5110436,4,B007UQ8IKG,"Fiona Gordon, just to look at, isn't who you might have cast as the fairy. You know, cute, young, ethereal, squeaky clean, pert'n'perky - she's not that. That's OK. Dominique Abel, as the mortal to whom her three wishes are given, isn't much of a Prince Charming character, either. Fiona (in the role of Fiona) and Dom (in the role of Dom) have a wonderful, quirky chemistry, though. Her odd ways of making wishes come true, her penchant for shopping without the bother of payment, and his chronic lack of ambition play off each other nicely, with occasional caroms off the enjoyable supporting characters.

A few surreal moments pop in, like the two dance numbers (one underwater, the other with her rotundly pregnant) give plenty to laugh at, as do the moments and characters in the psych ward. This doesn't have the wacked-out frenzy or continuous patter of some other comedies I've enjoyed. It has a quiet charm all its own, though.

PS: If subtitles give you hives, you probably want to skip this one - French (it figures) with English subtitles.",1335225600,21,1102,4.8201058201058204
5110437,5,B007UQ8IKG,It was my turn to pick the movie. I picked it because of the name. My husband rolled  his eyes. It was so funny. We laughed so hard. We both enjoyed it so much. The English sub titles were nice but even with out them you would have had to laugh. The faces were so expressive similar to the comedy actions found in Mr. Bean movies. So hilarious. My sides still hurt from laughing it is so absurd and amazingly portrayed. I can not remember a movie making me laugh this hard in a long time.,1485129600,2,488,4.083333333333333

What was awesome about this particular movie though, was the acting was so incredible, much like the old silent movies, that I feel anyone could really enjoy it.

The lead actors are excellent and versatile -- they dance, mime, and excel at physical comedy. I like the casting of two regular human beings as the romantic leads, especially Fiona as a fairy - talk about going against type. All those elements deserve 5 stars. That said, the story gradually wanders from genuinely funny and intriguing to inane and dumb (an opinion which may show my lack of culture).

Gaunt but charming stringbeans (and a couple in real life), Abel and Gordon play, respectively, a hotel desk clerk and a ""fairy"" on the loose. She grants him three wishes. The first two--a motor scooter and free lifetime petrol--she grants. But things get hairy when, after a night of skinny dipping and passion, she vanishes back into the loony bin where, in the blink of an eye, she becomes instantly, hugely pregnant. By means both hilarious and virtuoso, he manages to smuggle her out and they go on the lam. They are variously joined by and/or pursued by an Englishman with a dog, three African refugees, two cops, asylum staff, a nearly blind bar man, department store security, a ladies rugby team, and, of course, their infant son Jimmy. Everything else is a kind of blur, but suffice it to say the ending is a happy one. And the third wish? We are never told.

Abel and Gordon are the same comedy team that gave us The Iceberg, another masterpiece of physical and metaphysical comedy. I believe they operate out of Belgium, where they should be considered national treasures.",1423267200,,1409,4.723577235772358

The two middle-aged romantic leads don't have the warmth and personality of a Chaplin or Keaton (and maybe they're even a little off-putting) but they have an almost acrobatic grace and the goofball modern dance routines that signify their courtship rituals are kind of a hoot.

5110521,4,B007UQ8IKG,"Now and then a goofy film comes out of nowhere and nails you to the wall. This was one of those movies for me.

Here's the scoop. Dom is the night clerk at some bust-out hotel in France. One night Fiona comes in claiming to be a Fairy and grants him 3 wishes. He states the first 2, which she dutifully grants, but then the two begin to fall for each other and a wild odyssey ensues.

This is way out there. Expect the unexpected in nearly every scene. First, are the two principals. You may never encounter two more unlikely looking people anywhere, ever. And it's not just their looks. It's their physicality. Their limbs move as though they were made of rubber bands. There are two scenes where they perform dance routines (one under water) that are incredible. Not that they're particularly difficult. They're just so goofy and odd. There is a lot of physical comedy present. Some scenes work better than others. There is also more than a bit of farce. Again, some scenes work better than others. But there is love at the heart of all this and you really root for these two. They are both on the fringes of society and that they found each other is a cause for celebration.

This film has an odd look to it as well. Weird design and color palette, but it adds to the totally oddball nature of the movie. I might be a bit generous with my 4 star rating but just a bit. This is not your usual Hollywood fare. If you like movies for the pure thrill of the view, then check this one out.",1407801600,,1487,4.284697508896797

It's essentially a Shaggy Dog Story, played with sweetness and wit, performed by unique artists. The quirky dance segments are terrific. The baby is a great addition.

This is a tremendously creative, slapstick comedy with none of the irritating ""modern"" attempted slickness or gratuitous sex.

THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!

""The Fairy"" is a comedic nightmare---so strange and bizarre you will think you are dreaming an impossible dream. You will love this film and root for the characters all the way.

This is an ensemble company that have made several brilliant and famed comedies together and they are in total synch.

Fiona Gordon is a master of physical comedy. There is even one scene where she hysterically pre-dates the now-famous Van Damme ""split"" between two moving vehicles.

There were times I just laughed out loud.

This is the cleverest sort of comedy that just took me by surprise like walking into the door in the dark---I loved this film

See it!

5110592,5,B007UQ8IKG,"The plot is nearly as old as humankind: a man meets a magical being and is granted three wishes. In this case, the man is an addlepated night clerk (Dominique Abel) and the magical being is a lanky, eccentric redhead (Fiona Gordon) who claims to be a fairy. Since she can bring stalled elevators to life and make people fly, it's reasonable to assume that she is what she claims to be. After granting the clerk two wishes and giving him the wildest night of his life under the sea, she disappears and he must find her.

This comedy has been likened to the movies of Keaton and Tati; Dominique Abel's performance (and appearance) recall Roberto Benigni. But this comedy exists in a world of its own, recalling not so much the realm of Keaton as it does the much fantastic world of Melies. If it lacks the French magician's spectacular effects, it retains just enough ambience of the incredible to enable us to embrace the fantasy rather than be concerned about endangerment.

Abel and Gordon have wonderful comedic chemistry. Neither has ""conventional beauty,"" but possess eccentric charm and athletic physiques that lend themselves to physical comedy and pantomime. The supporting cast is equally wonderful, a collection of eccentrics worthy of a Fellini movie.

Those who are put-off by subtitles have little to fear in this movie; it's practically a silent film, peppered with vintage music and just enough dialogue to move the plot along. There's a bit a rear-view nudity and a surreal dance scene laced with sexuality, but it's all in keeping with the lunacy of the love story.

The extras on this dvd aren't much, but the feature compensates for that.",1355875200,,1656,4.820422535211268
5110593,4,B007UQ8IKG,"The Fairy was your typical quirky, awkward, French love story. The two main stars were Dominque Abel and Fiona Gordon were excellently cast, portraying two extremely awkward people looking for love and finding it in the most peculiar places. When the movie starts, you meet Dom, the night shift hotel clerk desperately trying to eat a sandwich. That is when Fiona, the self-acclaimed fairy comes and rocks his world.

The two instantly connect, and after what was insinuated as a raunchy night on the floor of the hotel lobby, Fiona grants Dom his two wishes: a scooter and free gas for life.

The couple then goes on many wild escapades that lands Fiona in a mental hospital and in the end, Dom in prison. Throughout all of this though, Dom and Fiona manage to keep their wildly awkward love firey hot. They participate in many spontaneous interpretative dance scenes and in the end, they run off into the distance being pursued by the cops.

The biggest idea that that arose from this film was that regardless of the trials that love can undergo, it will prevail if it really is true. Regardless of Fiona being taken to an asylum, Dom ended up in prison, and Fiona magically vanishing for a short time, they still managed to have a happy (but quirky) life with a child.

Overall, if you are in to the traditional quirky French films, this one is a must see. Even though the humor is dry and occasionally is eye-rollable, this movie is well worth the watch.",1354838400,,1458,4.617760617760617
5110594,4,B007UQ8IKG,"The trio of Dominique Abel, Fiona Gordon and Bruno Romy are known for their physical and absurdist comedies ""L'iceberg"" (2005) and ""Rumba"" (2008).

Beloved by many for incorporating a semi-silent style of filmmaking, focusing on physical comedy reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and also Jacques Tati, the trio once again came together to write, direct and star in the French/Belgian comedy,""The Fairy"" (La fe).

And received positive reviews from film critics for its crazy humor and physical comedy and now the film was released in America on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Kino Lorber.

VIDEO:

""The Fairy"" is presented in 1080p high Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  The cinematography by Clair Childeric is beautiful and she manages to capture the look and feel of the industrial port city of Le Havre.  Vibrant and colorful with natural skin tones to black levels that are nice and deep, overall picture quality is very good for ""The Fairy"".  Granted, there are some scenes where ""fake"" backgrounds are shown via green screen, the scenes were intentional.

But overall, there is nothing I can say badly about the video quality of ""The Fairy"".  The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Fairy"" is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is primarily physical, with some dialogue and music, so as expected, it was front and center channel heavy. But overall audio, dialogue and music is crystal clear.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Fairy"" comes with a theatrical trailer and stills gallery.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I watched the film ""Rumba"" was surprised but also captivated by the performance by Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon.

There films are so far from traditional French or Hollywood cinema in the fact that these two leading talents are so unlike the image of what one would see as romantic comedy film stars but the fact that these two along with Bruno Romy have managed to create three films that are odd, crazy but yet, these absurdist comedies are too fun to ignore.

The physical comedy by both Abel and Gordon are reminders of the days of Chaplin and Keaton but also the whimsical style of Jacques Tati, but in a more goofier and crazy way.  They are the most unlikely people to see in the film, but its that charm of being so against what is traditional in cinema that adds to ""The Fairy's"" allure.

Watching ""The Fairy"" is like having the goofiest dream that you ever had and making it into a movie.  For example, in one scene, a nude Dom and Fiona run into the beach and end up sinking into the ocean with nothing but seaweed on them, but yet, similar to their film ""Rumba"", the two take part in a dance.

In another scene, we see the skinny Fiona's stomach, suddenly ballooning to show that she is pregnant.  But in crazy fashion, when she gives birth, we see what looks like a six month old baby with its umbilical cord come out of her.  And together, these two odd individuals must be parents to this baby that they named ""Jimmy"".

You add in other odd characters such as the slimy John (Philippe Martz), who is doing something naughty in his bedroom, but why he needs his dog so much, is it for companionship or something else?  Hmm...

You also have Bruno Romy playing an owner of a pub.  But he is so blind that he can't even see what he is serving and the fact that people go into this pub and seeing this man who can barely see is quite absurd.  But so damn funny!  I couldn't help but laugh, because it was so out of left field.

Throw in three Black men, who are homeless but yet find themselves in the oddest positions that related to Dom, Fiona and John.  In one scene, they want to go to England, so they jump into an old vehicle in hopes that John can illegally take them there.

But there are so many odd moments in this film that you will find yourself laughing but also thinking, ""I can't believe they did that!"".

Usually, whenever a baby is seen in a film, we often see the parents caring for it.  In ""The Fairy"", little Jimmy is falling from a building, falling off a cliff, accidentally placed on the trunk of a moving car and suffice to say, this baby is going through the craziest experiences!

Granted, I'm sure there are parents who will complain about a baby being used in this way but hopefully no one is too much of a troglodyte to think that baby's can be treated in such a manner.

But its the absurdity of ""The Fairy"" that makes it so fun to watch and once in a while, it's great to have something that is crazy and clever, rather than the abundant of films that are crazy, banal and kitsch.

As for the Blu-ray, picture quality is gorgeous. The cinematography of Claire Childreic manages to capture the feel and surroundings of Le Havre.  Skin tones are natural, detail is very good in HD, including closeups and audio, presented in French DTS-HD MA 5.1 is crystal clear.  Although, it is primarily front and center channel driven.  As for special features, as much as I would have loved a commentary track or featurette, the theatrical trailer and stills gallery is included.

Overall, ""The Fairy"" is one of the craziest, goofiest and absurd film that I have seen all year, and have seen in quite a while.  But it's a film that I also enjoyed tremendously because it is so different and so unusual from the comedy films that we are used to seeing today.  From the beautifully choreographed dancing, the outrageous physical comedy and its zany storyline, ""The Fairy"" is a film that I definitely recommend!",1354320000,,5524,4.609007164790174
