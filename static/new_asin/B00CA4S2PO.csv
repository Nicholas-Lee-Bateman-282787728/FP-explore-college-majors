5708894,4,B00CA4S2PO,"This DVD is essentially an extended version of my favorite segment in Dub Room Special: Room Service, Florentine Pogen, Napolean Murphy Brock riding his small tiny hoss during Montana... if you're reading this review, you know this stuff is gold. This is Zappa's greatest assemblage of musicians playing some highly experimental music. It's a must own for any Zappa fan.

But, that doesn't mean it's perfect. This DVD has several lengthy stretches of video editing that hinders an otherwise beautiful audio-visual Zappa document. Most frustrating is the strobe effects used in countless sections of the concert footage in which the camera rapidly switches between various members of the band. It occurs so fast, it's impossible to see exactly what ANYONE is doing. So rather than taking in the performance and visualizing what is being played, the viewer is left to make sense of the headache inducing slideshow. It's a relief when one of these segments end.

The decision to use these moments is perplexing. Clearly, there is plenty of footage of each band member. Why ruin large chunks of it by splicing it all together? If they really wanted to give the fans what they wanted, they would have allowed the ability to switch between cameras. It might have taken a much larger investment of time and money, but I would shell out triple what I paid on Amazon for a feature like that.

My biggest gripe is the inexplicable scarcity of solo footage, most notably of Zappa on his guitar. I can understand us not getting to see ALL the solo's throughout the performances, but when Zappa is playing a guitar solo, that's what I want on the screen! I want to watch the man on his instrument!

So, in conclusion... yes, you should buy this. It isn't as great as it could be, but it's still worth its weight in gold for the Zappa-obsessed like myself. An even if you are a Zappa novice, the small price tag makes this an easy recommendation for anyone with an open mind and an ear for music. It's hard to imagine a true music fan not finding at least SOMETHING awe-inspiring within this DVD.

Music is the best! You'll love it... it's a way of life.",1370390400,38,2140,4.696
5708895,5,B00CA4S2PO,"This is one of Frank's best lineups, and while a lot of the content appears on ""Dub Room Special"", it is cool to see it flow uninterrupted (mostly)",1370390400,,147,4.285714285714286
5708896,5,B00CA4S2PO,"For those who are wondering if the evasive ""A Token of His Existance"" television special that Zappa produced in 1974 - and was never aired in the US - is really coming out on DVd, I can attest to the fact that it is! With bonuses to boot! As a music journalist I got my copy this week and it will be released tomorrow! Between Eagle Rock Entertainment - which has been releasing some great DVDs at reasonable prices - and the Zappa Family Estate (led by FZ's widow Gail) - this is a class production and a must for FZ fans.

The 73 minute ""concert"" program was transferred from the Original 2"" Quad Video Master in 2009 and looks and sounds great. The 11 songs are performed by FZ and the Mothers with George Duke on keyboards (and finger cymbals) and Ruth Underwood (percussion) and Chester Thompson (drums) providing the beat with Tom Fowler on bass and Napoleon Murphy Brock on sax and vocals. Performed in front of a live audience, a few of the numbers feature wonderful stop-action animation by Bruce Bickford  (a name new to me).

But there is more to the DVD. Bonuses like a ""Discography"" and ""DVDography"" are merely a collage of images of album and DVD covers but then there is 17-minute (!) video of FZ's appearance on the Mike Douglas Show in 1976 (two years after ATOHE was produced. Douglas, who was very supportive of rock stars (John and Yoko spent a week as co-hosts) on his afternoon show from Philadelphia - chats with FZ and gives him a solo performance spot (with FZ accompanied by Douglas' house band). Frank discusses the film and his music tastes along with other guests Jimmie (JJ) Walker (from TV's ""Good Times) and Kenny Rogers). This is obviously a rare TV appearance for FZ.

The DVD comes with a six-page foldout that resembles a TV guide cover and listing. No liner notes are included - mostly the track list, photos and credits.
Those FZ fans who waited years to see the while show will be thrilled. I'm just a casual FZ fan - I appreciate his musical talent and my fav album is still ""Ruben and the Jets"" - but I loved this DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5708897,4,B00CA4S2PO,"This DVD of the KCET TV special is a marvelous addition to any fan of Uncle Frank and all of our favorite line-up, the Nappy, Ruth, Duke ""Roxy-era Mothers"".

Much, but not all of - and therefore not enough of - this video material has been available on The Dub Room Special DVD.
Intercut with performances of the Halloween '81 show, it was OK, but didn't give us enough of the stuff we really wanted.

Finally, this disc will hold us over until (or if ever) the long-promised and Holy Grail of all Zappa videos - Roxy - arrives.
So, pre-order this disc and get funky with Frank Zappa and the best Mothers he ever put together!

Update after actual viewing:
A few songs, available on Dub Room Special - and key performances - are not included on this release. Those being Approximate; where FZ demonstrates how the ""heavy duty number"" can be sung, danced or played, and Cosmik Debris. I don't know if they were not included in the version as presented for TV broadcast, but they sure are great to see and would've been great to include on this release.
Also, the identification of Chester's Gorilla as Marty Perellis is edited out of this release.

I take away 1 of the 5 stars in my rating for being incomplete.
Still a great Zappa & Mothers treat.",1369180800,4,1248,4.4605263157894735
5708898,5,B00CA4S2PO,"As described above, this was a Zappa-funded, Zappa produced project capturing Frank's 1974 Band, with Bruce Bickford's animation. A very edited 3-5 minute piece of this film was aired by Wolfman Jack on the Midnight Special in it's 74-75 season.
The line-up consists of Frank Zappa guitar, vocals; George Duke keyboards, vocals; Napoleon Murphy Brock sax, vocals; Ruth Underwood percussion; Tom Fowler bass; Chester Thompson drums.

Aired on European TV, inferior PAL transfers to NTSC have been bootlegged in the USA for years.

The first thing I want to emphasize is that this version DOES NOT have those sound effects that accompanied the Bruce Bickford claymation stuff and drowned out the actual music. Yay! (If you don't know what I'm talking about, check Youtube)

Second, there are a couple of songs from this concert that are not on this DVD but are including on the DVD ""Dub Room Special,"" IIRC.

Clearly shown on television for its original airing, the crowd is sitting akimbo on the floor and don't quite know what to make of the fantastic spectacle taking place before them. Zappa and the band are clearly having more fun than anyone else in the building.
If you are trying to turn your friends on to Zappa and don't know where to start, this is the place. Much more digestible than something like Baby Snakes and with it clocking at a little over an hour not a huge commitment timewise either. Everyone is in fine form and the sound is excellent.

 As others have mentioned, I too could live w/o the highly annoying strobe effect flashing in the beginning. What were they thinking? I'm sure it'd be great if you're tripping on acid but for us regular folks, no thanks. Then, although I'll admit that claymation is cool, I could live w/o it when I'm trying to watch a music DVD. All I want to see is Frank and the Mothers play music.

Although it is is rather interesting at times, the animation portion was at times a bit too far out for me. I was luck enough to have attended several FZ/MOI concerts and hope that they might make it to video sometime. One or two videos on-line were filmed in B&W and the audio is spotty at times. Perhaps, the Zappa family has better copies and may release them down the road.",1392163200,,461,4.372093023255814

Now, the video editing is a whole 'nuther matter.  What in God's name were they thinking?  I would buy this disc again if they just re-did the video editing; all this back-n-forth camera shots leaves you with a friggin' migrane!  Fortunately, in about the middle of the disc, they video-editing calms down a bit, but then resurfaces.

If you're a Zappa fan, you should probably own this.  But I really think they need to re-do the crazy, aneurysm-inducing, video-editing.  They obviously have the complete video.  Maybe 7-10 seconds before switching cameras, OK?",1391472000,2,612,5.05

I will say this though, I originally had a copy of this I bought online somewhere years ago, and this ""official"" FZT release advertised this DVD to be way superior to the copies that were floating around for sale on the internet.

Also on the set are Kenny Rogers and comedian Jimmie Walker (popular at that time from the contemporaneous Good Times television series). Douglas asks what music Zappa likes to listen to ""to relax"", and Zappa responds that for light relaxation he listens to disco since it's utterly predictable, but for more deep relaxation he prefers Webern and the string quartets of Elliott Carter (presumably the first three, given the date).

The only problem, It's been de-interlaced, but not the type where the two fields are meshed into one, sadly the other field has been removed giving the feature and the bonus interview a pixelated look. Luckily it's not that big of a problem for the overall enjoyment of the special, but it loses that ""video look"" it would've had.

5708940,3,B00CA4S2PO,"Frank Zappa must have learned something from producing and editing this because he never made this glaring a mistake of splicing the picture frames as fast and often as he did when he was editing music. This technique reappeared again in Baby Snakes but not nearly as much as in A Token of His Extreme. Editing music is something I think Zappa enjoyed doing and the greatness of The Mothers ""Uncle Meat"" album proves he was a master. You cannot edit video the same way you edit audio because missing the transitions isn't as jarring to the ears as it is to the eyes. Zappa CLEARLY didn't know this and I think that's the real reason why he couldn't market the 73 minute concert film(DVD run time is 90 minutes if you include the 17 minute Mike Douglas extra).

When a song has many notes being played in a short period of time, Zappa tries to edit the video to the pace of the notes, at times the editing is down to a fraction of a second. Try watching that and you will end up looking away which is not how to enjoy any video.

There is some excellent Bruce Bickford claymation work in the video, but not nearly as much as there would be later on in Baby Snakes; and even Bickford's claymation falls victim to the hyper rapid video editing on 'Inca Roads'

Zappas doing a great solo and instead of focusing on it they start the strobe affect or when Ruth and Chester do a synchronized percussion part it would be nice to see it no strobe affect. This terrible affect was not used sparingly but all the time. I cannot recommended this unless someone re edits it. Zappa was great at music, really bad at video.",1372118400,23,697,4.287878787878788

5708943,5,B00CA4S2PO,"This dvd shows one of Zappa's finest small bands playing virtuosic music.  I'd seen FZ and the Mothers many times but I don't recall him ever playing percussion.  It makes sense since his music is so rhythmically complex. I agree with some of the above criticism:  the choppy editing makes it hard to concentrate on the music.  OTOH, Bickford's claymatronic animations are truly amazing and add so much to this 'TV special.' I especially enjoyed Ruth Underwood's playing...and George Duke is a maniac here.
Highly recommended!",1371772800,4,526,5.0813953488372094
5708944,5,B00CA4S2PO,"This was a self produced video concert that Frank did for his Honker Home Video, and that he had hoped would be picked up and broadcast in the US.  It wasn't.  But the concert shows one of Franks best bands with George Duke, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Ruth Underwood, Tom Fowler and Chester Thompson working hard for you.  The concert was produced in 1974 and runs for just over an hour.  Included in the extras is an interview that Frank did on the Mike Douglas show with Jimmie Walker and Kenny Rodgers.  Ok the down side, the first part of the concert and some of the longer songs have animation by Bruce Bickford which is annoying and distracting, and a good portion of the first half of the show is done with the old MTV (remember them?) quick cut format which are so quick it could almost cause a seizure. By the second half of the show most of the cuts are gone and you can focus on the band and the music.  For Frank fans if the music sounds familiar, you've heard this show on The Dub Room Special.  But watching this band is a treat and it was fun to see Frank having a good time playing!",1371513600,2,1094,4.230769230769231

8579047,5,B00CA4S2PO,"This dvd commemorates one of Zappa's greatest bands (Ruth Underwood, Chester Thompson, Tom Fowler, George Duke, Napoleon Murphy Brock) at the absolute height of its abilities playing in concert. Only the original Mothers of Invention (1964-1969) was a better and more uniquely original Zappa band although less virtuosic on a straight chops-to-chops basis of comparison. This band is certainly far better than the much more juvenile and and teenage-friendly ""Baby Snakes"" group, although even that band is magnificent compared to almost any other outside the Zappa universe. Actually Napoleon Murphy Brock's James-Brown-style dancing on stage is already more entertainment value than you will get anywhere else.  Hardcore Zappa fans such as myself already have this but, for the casual fan just getting into Zappa, there is no better introduction than this DVD or ""The Roxy Movie"" which commemorates the previous band with Bruce Fowler on Trombone and the great ex-Don-Ellis drummer Ralph Humphrey added.  As many others have noted, the editing style of this concert features a million jump cuts, sometimes a cut every two seconds where you can't even freeze-frame the image fast enough before the next one pops up. However, this is something Zappa himself did as an experiment in film-making which gives a totally unique ""perspective through many simultaneous prisms at the same time""  feel to the film. Sometimes I wish there was at least 10 or 15 minutes of more normal concert footage similar to ""Baby Snakes"" and ""Roxy the Movie"" to go along with the experiment but overall, it's better to have it in this totally weird form than in ""normal"" fashion like everybody else's concert movie. Zappa's intention seems to be capturing  and linking significant visual moments as simultaneously as possible with other visual moments.",1472688000,3,1828,5.2714776632302405
