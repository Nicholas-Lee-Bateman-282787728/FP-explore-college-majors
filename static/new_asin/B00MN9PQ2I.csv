6590026,5,B00MN9PQ2I,"My 3 year old son loves Thomas and I wanted to buy a Thomas Christmas DVD for him for one of his St. Nick's Day gifts. He just got it yesterday and we've already watched it through twice! I wasn't sure at the time I bought it if it was a movie or just several episodes. To clarify, there are five episodes, which are each about 10 minutes long.

The names of the episodes are:
Last Train for Christmas
Long Lost Friend
Duncan the Humbug
Duck in the Water
The Perfect Gift

From an adult's perspective, Thomas is a great show to introduce to young children because it teaches them good lessons on being nice to others, helping each other out, etc. I am very cautious about what I let my kids watch and I feel completely comfortable letting them watch Thomas because it's a cute show and it teaches valuable lessons at the same time. Plus, since this is a Christmas DVD, it's the perfect time of year to watch it! If you know someone who is a Thomas fan, this DVD would be essential to them and would make a great Christmas gift! I highly recommend it!",1449446400,8,1050,4.271356783919598
