3787911,3,B001T21R46,"The movies are mostly unknown, but they have their moments. It is nice to see stars such as Clint Walker, Kim Novak, Zero Mostel, Burgess Meredith doing their thing, late in their careers.",1353369600,,188,4.7272727272727275
3787912,3,B001T21R46,"The Great Bank Robbery is the better of the two. Good color, widescreen, Kim and Clint make the show move. The second Bank Hoax is too odd for my liking. For the price it did not matter about the Hoax because I wanted it for The Great Bank Robbery. Would of been nice if both were worthy.  C6",1348099200,,292,4.0344827586206895
3787913,3,B001T21R46,"...While no one would confuse this film with Othello... critics in 1969 missed the point.  While largely lightweight and at times uneven... it is a hoot!
...Fans of Clint Walker will see this as one of his greatest roles... sending up his laconic ""Cheyenne Bodie"" character.  SPOILER ALERT!  When Kim Novak kisses him and asks him if he likes it he says... in his best laconinc fashion;  ""Just because I talk slow don't mean I'm peculiar...""
...Zero Mostel is at his best... pious behavior covering larceny.  Kim Novak is sort of a charming oversexed flower child.  And Claude Akins steals his scenes as an outlaw with violence ""issues...""

3787914,5,B001T21R46,"This double feature DVD is a hoot and the film that features Clint Walker & Kim Novack In THE GREAT BANK ROBBERY was just great. They worked off each other so well. Zoro Mostel was BRILLIANT! What a fun movie. If you love westerns with comedy then buy this bargin soon.
Clint Walker always gave his best on screen. If he were a young man today I could see him playing a serious super hero as in THOR or Conan. He really is and was that good as an actor.",1306281600,2,453,4.044444444444444
3787915,5,B001T21R46,"Ordered this months before I needed it...for a gift...when opened, there was no disc.
Even though MANY months had gone by, I took a chance and wrote them about the problem.

OUTCOME....no problem.  They promptly refunded all $$$'s...no questions asked except for the order #.  This company will get more orders from me and my friends...if this is an example of their ethics...you could not do better....order from them and recommend them, they've earned their place as one of the best.....

Oh..btw... the movies are wonderful.  Clint Walker is yummy and funny...  You WILL enjoy...  if not one, than the other..",1279756800,3,612,5.0
3787916,4,B001T21R46,"There are a few films out there that not many people have seen... or, at least, haven't seen for ages due to their only recent availability on DVD.  Both titles on this dual movie disc -- ""Bank Robbery Collection"" -- are in that category.

""The Great Bank Hoax"" is one of the kinder, gentler stories of theft -- and certainly one which an earlier generation will appreciate for the wonderful performances of screen icons such as Burgess Meredith, Richard Baseheart, Ned Beatty, Michael Murphy, Paul Sand and... Arthur Godfrey?  Seems an error in bookkeeping was the design of an ambitious clerk, though that is not known at the time.  Adjustments have to be made to cover the shortfall, and that takes care of the plot.  And what a cover-up it is!  Simply put, you'll love the adventures of these kindly crooks as they scurry to ""fix things"".

An old favorite of mine is ""The Great Bank Robbery""; with the unforgettable Zero Mostel as a less than angelic preacher, leading his flock of crooks to the impregnable bank at 'Friendly' -- the bank of the west's ner-do-well's!  Clint Walker is the undercover lawman set to unlock the secrets of the bank, posing as a laundryman, who, by the way, falls for the preacher's stunning 'mistress', played by a vivacious Kim Novak (""I weigh 120 pounds...""  ""..one-hundred twenty-five!"").  Meanwhile the notorious band of banditos (led by Akim Tamiroff and Larry Storch ""Listen to Papa!!"") tries again and again to do things the hard way.  However, it is the escape that ties the whole plot together -- with a balloon chase Captained by the Great Gregory (""Why do they call you 'Great""?"").  Oh yes; there's music as well: Academy Nominated song ""Rainbow Riders"", sung by Zero and flock.

Both films look great on the latest 16 X 9 aspect ratio screens and show good color after all these years, along with good sound.  ""Hoax"" was done in 1978 and ""Robbery"" was circa 1969 -- but renewed copyright by the studio has kept the technical criteria up to date.  You can't go to ONE movie these days at the price of this double feature.  Don't miss it.  Laughs are hard to come by in these days of Big Kabooms and Bigger Kabooms!",1262044800,15,2159,4.669312169312169
3787917,4,B001T21R46,"Can you picture a comedic version of today's banking bungles set in a small town?  Welcome to The Great Bank Hoax!  The Great Bank Hoax is a witty comedy about a couple of local  bank managers (Burgess Meredith, Richard Basehart) who, in preparing for an audit by the bank examiner,  discover their bank has been the victim of embezzlement by a teller (Paul Sand) who did it just to prove it could be done.  Less concerned about the theft and more about looking foolish,  the bank managers concoct a cover-up whereby they rob their own bank and seek to get rich themselves.  Given the story takes place in the stereotypical small, gossipy ""All American"" town, everybody soon gets involved and wants a piece of the action.  And in the end who gets rich?  I won't spoil it for you but you'll want to see.

Directed by Joe Jacoby, The Great Bank Hoax takes you back to an America seemingly long gone.  But is it?  The neatest aspect of the movie is a Burgess Meredith you've never seen before.  We all know and love Burgess but most have never seen him in a role like this.  There's not a shade of the Penguin or Mick (Rocky Balboa's manager) - just a mellow, fun-loving, conniving bank manager.

Watch and enjoy the movie.  You'll recognize almost all of the actors - even if not by name.  I think you'll find its well worth your time.",1246406400,7,1333,4.4421487603305785
3787918,4,B001T21R46,"The films were as expected,they were acceptable  I do notwant to give any personal information!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1246147200,,116,6.733333333333333
3787939,3,B001T21R46,"THE GREAT BANK ROBBERY is a Hollywood product of its times, a Warner Brothers offering of the late 60's,  It has that same look and feel as THE GREAT RACE, made at Warners four years earlier.  It wouldn't surprise me if even some of the props from that earlier film found their way into this much smaller scale production.

The script has a tantalizing premise:  unbeknowst to each other, three different gangs of bandits simultaneously converge on a small town bank that specializes in holding stolen gold.  The banker, who poses as a pillar of the town while hoarding the stolen booty, prides himself on the bank's impregnability.  But the psycho train robber who deposits said gold trusts nobody.  William Peter Blatty (who wrote THE EXORCIST) penned this script, but he and the director can't quite deliver the heights of hilarity the story promises as these parties all converge on the small town of Friendly.

But the script hardly matters.  The performances carry the film.  The great cast is over the top throughout as they steal scenes from one another.  Hard to say who comes off the craziest.  Zero Mostel as the ringleader of the gang posing as missionaries, and Larry Storch as the bumbling idiot son of the leader of the Mexican banditos are, as always, way over the limit as performers.  Their histrionics are no surprise.  Grady Sutton is his usual befuddled self as the preacher who gets run out of town.  Elisha Cook, Jr. is, as always, a bundle of neuroses as the psycho robber's side kick.  The real delight comes from watching Claude Akins come unhinged as the trigger happy robber with a streak of self-examination (""Why do I kill everyone I love?"" he asks himself), Ruth Warrick as a schoolmarmish town matron who unravels as she falls head over heels for Mostel, and Mako as the exasperated philosophy-spouting head of the Chinese gang.

Some of the best laughs come from Clint Walker's deft performance as the baffled, not-to-be trifled with deputy who's out to--well, who knows? since he gets waylaid by a truly loony Kim Novak at her seductive best.  Novak shows plenty of skin, especially in her Lady Godiva ride on a white horse through town (she says she wore a body stocking).  Even though she had turned her back on stardom three years earlier after complaining that she was viewed as nothing but a sexpot in her Hollywood heyday, she's not afraid to flaunt it, and at 36 she looks sensational.

Probably top honors for scenery chewing go to Akim Tamiroff as the long-suffering head of the Mexican raiders.  But it's Walker I'll remember best from this film.  He proves himself far more than a slab of beefcake (though he shows some skin here, too, in the picnic scene with Novak).  Yes, there are a lot of ethnic stereotypes in the film (at least no Hollywood Indians get in the act, Marlon Brando can relax), and the Vietnam War was heating up, but if you take this bit of escapism as a lively romp in ensemble acting by some of Hollywood's best (Warrick was in CITIZEN KANE, after all, Cook in THE MALTESE FALCON, Tamiroff in TOUCH OF EVIL, Sam Jaffe in BEN-HUR.  And Novak, of course, in VERTIGO) it's an amusing hour and a half watching these movie heavyweights take time off from Great Cinema to have fun in front of the camera being nutty with help from some of the leading lights of TV (Walker) and Broadway (Mostel).",1399075200,3,3357,4.679727427597956
3787940,5,B001T21R46,"I wanted this because of the Great Bank Robbery. Clint Walker and Kim Novak are two of my favorite Movie Stars of my youth, and both in a comedy together is great! You would not go wrong getting this one.",1392076800,3,204,4.125

3787944,4,B001T21R46,"I purchased this dvd on a lark. The plot sounded OK, but what really piqued my interest was the cast in The Great Bank Robbery, one of two films on the disk: Zero Mostel,Sam Jaffe, Akim Tamiroff, Kim Novak, Claude Akins,Larry Storch, Bob Steele and a host of other seasoned veteran actors. It was extremely funny and very campy(reminds me of The Gambler Returns and TGR:Luck Of The Draw with Kenny Rogers); Granted, this was not the Zero Mostel version of The Producers, but I had a hard time not laughing at almost every scene. As for the disk and packaging: The packaging was fine and disk quality was excellent: Crisp video,good color and clear audio. The ""b"" class visuals were the artwork/presentation of the opening and closing credits;  The Rembrandt effect was captured in the bank mural used in the film (you have to see the film to know what I'm referring to). I still have to watch the second film on the disk. Hopefully it will be as funny as ""The Robbery.""",1377734400,,969,4.568965517241379

8340340,4,B001T21R46,"The rating is mainly for The Great Bank Robbery.  I saw it once years ago and always wanted to see it again.  It apparently got lousy reviews when it first came out, but it is a decent comedy, not up to the quality of the cast, but still nowhere near as bad as the reviewers seemed to find it.  Zero Mostel is his usual rowdy self, supported by a cast which would once have comprised the who's who of character actors.  I somehow also forgot the sequence of Kim Novak doing a Lady Godiva to distract a bank guard (I must have been very young when I saw it.), avoiding an R rating with a few strategically place daisies.
The Great Bank Hoax was apparently inspired by the Watergate coverup.  The coverup turns out to be a greater crime than the one it was designed to obscure.  I never heard of it, and, for good reason.  Although not a total loss, the pacing is very slow.  The script could have used a good rewrite. Again, the actors were once well known, though not A-list, but they seem supremely uninspired.  Even the twists are revealed in such a downplayed manner that you could easily miss them.  It has one of the most boring seduction scenes ever.  I actually watched it in one sitting without falling asleep, but it is a curiosity that I will probably not watch again for a long, long time. This I would give a two, or at most a three if it were offered separately.",1444348800,,1375,4.290697674418604

8340343,3,B001T21R46,"The only thing these two films have in common is that they have the words great and bank in their respective titles.  Neither film is particularly memorable but work as decent time fillers.

""The Great Bank Hoax""-Small town bank is embezzled to the tune of $100,000.00 (a lot of dough in 1979) so the bank executives scheme to rob the branch to avoid the taint of scandal.  Supposed parallel to Watergate but the metaphor was lost on me.  Fitfully amusing but not outright.  Highlight is Burgess Meredith's turn as a wily bank vice president.

""The Great Bank Robbery""-Western parody about competing forces attempting to heist the gold from an impregnable Southwest Texas bank.  Film is more frenetic than funny but not without its moments.  Noteworthy is the diverse cast (Zero Mostel, Kim Novak, Clint Walker et. al.) and a script by William Peter Blatty who would subsequently write ""The Exorcist"".",1433980800,,901,4.96
8340344,5,B001T21R46,Both of these movies are great.  I bought this for the Clint Walker flick.  To see this great big man act as if he;s high is a hoot.
