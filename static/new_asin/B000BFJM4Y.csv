2416022,2,B000BFJM4Y,A very strange story but with a happy ending. Not one of the best ones that I have ordered.,1224460800,,91,3.8421052631578947
2416023,3,B000BFJM4Y,"An impoverished young widow enters into service as a maid to a creepy old pederast in his mansion in England. After the pederast makes improper advances to her son, he blackmails her into staying in the house, and preventing her from marrying her commoner boyfriend. The second half involves the daughter of the young widow, who must enter into service after their employer dies.

This was a very strange story, very dark and deep. I admit I didn't care that much for the first half since the master was a creepy guy, and I felt bad for the poor widow. The romance wasn't very strong. I did like the second half involving Biddy and her troubles as a servant.

I'd give this 3 stars. It wasn't my favorite, and the subject matter was a tad dark for my taste.",1223596800,8,757,4.438848920863309

8086322,5,B000BFJM4Y,"I love this movie. I wish Amazon Prime Videos carried Catherine Cookson's DVD's. She's an excellent story teller and there wonderful movies based on her books out there. Unfortunately, Amazon Prime doesn't have any so if we want to watch them, we have to buy them. Netflix used to carry them & I was lucky enough to watch all of them. Netflix also no longer carries her movies. Such a shame because they're extremely entertaining, especially if you enjoy well-told period pieces of Ireland. For those that love Cookson's books, the movies are a special treat.",1454457600,,559,4.833333333333333
8086323,1,B000BFJM4Y,"I found the characters to be more like caricatures than real people.  The
vicious attack of the young man on the master was horrific and totally
unbelievable as was the attack on Biddy in the laundry.  There was the
usual cast of good actors -- just wish they had a better story to portray.",1419638400,,290,4.351851851851852
8086324,5,B000BFJM4Y,"This is one of my most favorite Catherine Cookson movies.  I love everything about this movie including the lovely soundtrack music I find myself humming throughout the day after watching this movie.  I also love the vintage feel and old world charm of the characters and background.  You can practically feel the coldness in the air when the widow breaks the ice on top of the large barrel of milk.  Anyway, I was deeply moved when the benefactor was unfairly and severely injured by the widow's son who cannot be described as anything less than a rotten, spoiled, pugnacious, odious brat who should have been severely punished for his crimes.  The benefactor was simply a kind-hearted man who attempted to do good with his money, whose behavior was perceived in the wrong way and subsequently taken advantage of.  I also love the feisty old wealthy grandmother who is full of vim and vigor and recognizes the widow's daughter is no dummy, but is quite the opposite and knows she had better watch her step lest she become an intellectual positive influence on the other unfortunate maidens sentenced to work in their workhouse.  I will cherish this movie and will not part with it.  Hopefully I will still have it in my possession when I am old and gray and want something worthwhile and good to watch.",1410307200,,1303,4.734513274336283
8086325,5,B000BFJM4Y,"I loved this movie so bought the dvd. The main character is a girl who becomes a washerwoman at an estate, and falls in love with the grandson and this movie has a good ending. All of the Catherine Cookson movies are worth purchasing. I watch each one about once per year as they never get old and always develop several characters in the stories.",1399248000,,347,4.3538461538461535
8086326,5,B000BFJM4Y,I love my movie collection 97% was bought from amazon I will continue to collect and I do from this sight and all movies were in excellent condition whether bought pre-owned or brand new not once did I receive a broke or scratched movie .

Quality is very good.",1329177600,,114,4.476190476190476
8086328,1,B000BFJM4Y,"This was a waste of time.  If I wanted to watch something that would put me in the mood to sleep; I would select this DVD. None of the characters were likeable or admirable.  The story line was tragic, but I didn't really care about any of the characters enough to feel any empathy for their circumstance.  Save your money.",1270425600,,323,4.35
8086329,5,B000BFJM4Y,Love the BBC productions because they are well acted and lavish productions. The individual on the cover has a very limited part and do not understand why she was chosen to grace the cover. But the story was touching and well acted well worth buying.,1258329600,4,250,4.5777777777777775
8086330,5,B000BFJM4Y,"It just goes to show you how hard of a life women had as Mother's to keep their children safe and happy.  This movie depicts a young widow who would do whatever it took to give her children as normal a life as possible and making sure that they could be somebody someday, no matter how long it took.",1234051200,3,299,4.067796610169491
