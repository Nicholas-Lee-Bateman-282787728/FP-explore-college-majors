8218299,3,B000VDLSR0,"This is a documentary on the life and death of William Cooper. He was the author of ""Behold A Pale Horse"", which is a conspiracy book. I had seen a taped lecture by him on UFO's (couldn't finish the watch or finish reading Pale Horse). This ""The Lagacy of William Cooper"" dvd is an interesting, sad and scary story.",1236556800,5,315,4.3559322033898304
