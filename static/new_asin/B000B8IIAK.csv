8453321,5,B000B8IIAK,"This is an entertaining movie. You should not search for reality. VERY Nice songs. New comedian did excellent- who pretended to be a lame to see Sushmita. If you like hindi movie, you can own it. Story line is not too bad: susmita is Salman's (doctor) receiptionist/nurse? Salman's girlfrind is Katrina. Salman uses susmita to cover up the story he made up once to katrina. Susmita then falls in love with salman. Salmans real brother loves katrina, who shows it sometimes. At last susmita becomes salmans girl, AFTER katrina (at the very end of the movie) start saying (in the middle of their wedding) that susmita loves salman too much- so he should go back to him. When katrina says- susmita loves you - please go to ger - salman leaves the church immediately & searches for susmita!!!!(where they were getting married - though they are Hindu- because salman's mom was crying to an Idol). That seemed funny, because in the whole movie - salman didn't have any interest for susmita. Salman's mom's funny attitude was not too bad. Susmita's repeated broken dreams were the only realistic thing in the whole movie. Susmita looked absolutely fabulous, Salman too. I am not Katrina fan - so her innocent - cute baby type talking irritated me.",1177804800,,1240,4.799065420560748
