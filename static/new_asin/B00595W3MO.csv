4620373,5,B00595W3MO,"I saw this film at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck, Michigan.  Some friends chose the movie.  I couldn't imagine why I'd be interested in frivolous lawsuits.  But, I was immediately drawn into the story, and found each chapter compelling in its own way.  If I ever need a lawyer, I would like to have this film-maker represent me!  It was so stunning to realize that this is always a non-issue for the individual until it's too late.  None of us has any stake in making sure that jury trials continue, until something terrible happens.  The ""hot coffee"" story itself was sobering.  And then the story about the medical malpractice ""caps"" which meant that TAXPAYERS had to pay bills instead of the people responsible for the damage brought me to tears.  The chapter about corporations refusing employees' right to trial has now been resolved in the courts.  The jury agreed with the corporation on this one, proving that juries are not nearly as anti-business as the tort reformers would have you believe. The judicial contests and corruption were beyond belief.  After the movie, the film-maker answered some questions.  The first one was ""This movie is very one-sided...""  She said, ""Yes, I am an advocate for the jury system. The other side has dominated the communications on this issue.  I'm trying to balance it out a little.""  Since watching this movie, I've become aware of how little I knew/know about these issues.  I think it is a ""must-see"" documentary!",1315440000,13,1474,4.883064516129032
4620374,5,B00595W3MO,"For far too long, the media, conservative politicians, and large corporations have dominated the discussion of the civil justice system.  Their influence has caused too many to assume that courts are inundated with frivolous lawsuits and greedy lawyers.  What Susan Saladoff does in this movie, is peel back the ignorance and misinformation, to expose the truth about what really happens when someone is brave enough to stand up for what's been done to them.

It's almost impossible to watch this movie without feeling the need to protect our civil justice system.  Don't miss it!!!",1315440000,2,582,5.159574468085107

4620376,5,B00595W3MO,"This is the documentary that every American should see. Most people don't understand that there are mechanisms within the legal system to make sure that frivolous lawsuits don't go to trial. They assume, just hearing about a large verdict, that there wasn't a factual basis for the verdict. Other than lawyers, no one I know could tell me the actual facts of the McDonald's coffee case but they are quick to refer to it when talking about tort reform.",1315353600,5,451,4.7215189873417724
4620377,5,B00595W3MO,"Essential information is revealed here within this powerful documentary.
Here is the detailed unveiling of corporate multi-million-dollar propaganda campaigns,
intentionally ment to confuse and brainwash Americans.

Photo's are shown here of the deep burns Stella Liebeck suffered in the McDonald's hot coffee incident.
She was 79 at the time, she required numerous skin graphs and nearly died.
But the industry twisted the case to make it the poster child for frivolous lawsuits.
Meanwhile McDonald's kept a low profile on the fact that they previously had,
between January 1983 to March 1992, over 700 burn cases.

Corporations have armed themselves with these tactics,
plus powerful unrelenting lobbing, and friends in high places.
They have extensively campaigned to affect jury's and senator's to set cap's on damage awards.
And in addition they have among other things,
actually managed to change a CRUCIAL part of our 200 year old constitution of the United States.
Thus they unbound themselves from prior limits,
and now can give unlimited donations to the politician's who will support their issues.
In other words, they control the add campaigns which ultimately sway which politicians American's vote for.
Opening this floodgate means corporations literally hold the future of most American's in their hands.

This documentary is a stunning and reveiling well segmented account of the battle over Tort reform,
and what IS happening to America.
Reveiled here are many devices and methods that are used.
Documented footage shows that the whole point of the Tort reform is to keep the public from accessing the courts.
All public, no matter if frivolous or honest.
Camera's follow individuals as they try to access the courts for restitution for the wrongs done to them.
That's when they find out the true meaning of Tort ""reform"" and what's happened to their rights.

U.S. maps are high-lighted to show which states have which caps on damages, there can be three kinds:
Punitive damages,
Non-economic,
Total caps.
Each category is explained.

Another way to block a person's right to sue,
is when you agree whether you know it or not to 'arritration'.
This common tactic is exposed and explained.
Information is given about the immensely large,
extremly powerful and very corrupt U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
This is not a government agency, it's an enormous mass of corporations.
They are exposed for who they are, how they sway elections, and what their intent is.

This is likely the most accurate, deeply informative documentary you'll ever have an opportunity to own.
Every household should watch this documentary, and understand it's impact.",1312588800,36,2653,5.260047281323877
4620378,5,B00595W3MO,"The movie was excellent and the other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the movie. I just wish more time was spent on the Supreme Court's Citizen's United decision which essentially decided that corporate funding cannot be limited. That has such far reaching consequences for our country, way beyond tort reform. Our frustrations with big oil, big healthcare and the way Wall Street walks away unscathed after inflicting the worst economic disaster upon us since the Great Depression can be traced to the power of corporate lobbying.
While we in America are quick to recognize corruption in other countries, are blind to our own corrupt practices--which have sadly been institutionalized over time. Hot Coffee shows how insidious the process has been. This is a long overdue wake up call to America.",1311120000,9,816,5.142857142857143

4620394,2,B00595W3MO,"Like most documentaries, Hot Coffee uses a sample size of cases in the minority to push it's own agenda. The focus of the film is on tort reform and how it hurts people who have been legitimately injured. Tort laws put caps on the amount of money that an injured party can get, in certain types of lawsuits, for the purpose of stopping what the government considers to be frivolous claims. The documentary focuses on five specific cases and brings up the old discussion on whether or not it's better to let ten guilty men go free, rather than to punish one innocent person. Yes, the people in these stories were legitimately hurt and didn't get a fraction of what they deserved, because of these laws, but they are the exception instead of the rule. The most notable case the documentary focuses on is the case in which an elderly woman sued McDonald's, after she spilled hot coffee on herself. It's a case most people would consider frivolous, until you actually hear the facts. The woman's legal team was able to show that she received third degree burns and almost lost her life, because McDonald's required their coffee to be kept at a ridiculous 190 degrees. The elderly woman won over two million dollars, but had her award capped due to tort laws and the result was barely enough money to cover her medical bills. As I said before, these cases are exceptions to the rule, and by compiling these exceptions, this documentary makes it appear as though innocent American's are being screwed on a daily basis, which isn't true. While some people unfortunately fall through the cracks, the film fails to mention all the fraud and non-sense that has been stopped by these laws, or how these laws have kept insurance costs down. The bottom line, anyone can push any agenda they want, as long as they find a few select examples that can make their case for them, but it doesn't mean that their claims have merit.",1397952000,,1911,4.640117994100295

4620397,5,B00595W3MO,"...and you will see why after you watch this documentary.

Like most people I knew at the time, I thought it was absurd that a woman was suing McDonald's because she spilled Hot Coffee on her lap when I heard the news. An outrage! We must put a limit on frivilous lawsuits and jackpot justice! As I learned years later and is explained in the movie, the facts surrounding the case are not what many (if not most) of the public perceived them to be. In a nutshell, here's what happened: Stella Leibeck's son took her to the drive-through at McDonald's, and she ordered coffee. They pulled to park briefly, and Stella held the coffee in her lap while she reached for the sugar, and it spilled and burned her. The spill caused third-degree burns on her legs, requiring a long hospital stay and skin grafts (which aren't cheap.) Initially, all Stella was asking for was that McDonald's pay for the medical expenses that Medicare didn't pay for and that they lower the temperature of the coffee, so that this wouldn't happen again. McDonald's would only pay $800, which of course, was inadequate, so the case went to court. I will allow the viewers to watch the rest of the story themselves.

""Hot Coffee"" goes beyond the Stella Leibeck case and explains how there has been a well-funded, organized effort all across the country for so-called tort reform in effect erodes citizens of access to the justice system. Legislatures set what damages are, rather than juries, who know what the facts are and are in a better position to make judgements. There's also the issue of mandatory arbitration, which is increasingly common. Arbiters rarely rule in consumers favor, for obvious reasons.

Like others I imagine, I too 'poked fun or made jokes' at the fact hot coffee should of course, be served hot.  If you watch this with an open mind, you're opinion will also likely change.  As the film concludes, it makes 4 incredibly important statements - all related to the film topics, and all true, especially the part about questioning what you read/see in the media. So many people react to situations and stories, when they do not have the facts!

The film while starting and ending on the McDonald's Hot Coffee incident, includes 3 additional stories, all inter-connected by laws governing jury verdicts and Tort reform. Like many documentaries, it questions the actions of big business and many US government agencies, whose actions are at best 'questionable' and rarely in the best interest of the 'little guy'.

After viewing the film, you should be very concerned with our runaway government and powerful lobbying interests. You should also form your own opinions, and do your own research, but the film (in my estimate) succeeds in opening your mind that there are 2 sides to every story, and the best way to hear them is through our court system.  Even the Halliburton case proves exactly what the film is arguing for - the right to a citizens day in court. If you believe the 'victim' portrayed in the film is innocent of no wrong doing, that's OK (many viewers likely did). The case, when finally brought to the court system allowed both sides to present, and a verdict to be rendered by a jury based on all facts.

Our rights are eroded everyday, and this powerful film shows the potential for extreme injustice.  It points out the very fact we are all victims, often unknowingly of arbitration clauses (if you own a cell phone or credit card, you could be the next victim).  It wouldn't surprise me if most websites we traffic frequently have these clauses, which we agree to simply by using the site.  To this end, I had to read some of the 1-star reviews.  One clearly is angry, and that's OK. The very system of justice in America is founded on our freedom of speech.  When we take away that freedom, this film will show you several examples where that could potentially be the biggest injustice.

4620408,5,B00595W3MO,"Most of us have heard of the ""frivolous"" McDonalds coffee lawsuit which netted a woman almost three million dollars. After viewing this documentary, not only do you see the suit was about as far away from frivolous as you could get, but it started a smear campaign to put people in a mind set to poo-poo any other such case.

Here's the scoop. This documentary begins with the infamous McDonalds/Liebeck case where the 89 year old woman spilled hot coffee on herself and sued McDonalds for a king's ransom. It goes into the details of the case, then goes on to show the movement in the country on making things such so the average citizen cannot get their day in court no matter how negligent the other party might be.

This is a freaking horror show. The case shows the true negligence of McDonalds over and over again in regard to their coffee. It then goes to show how Carl Rove and others funnel millions of dollars into state supreme court judge elections to insure getting industry friendly judges who will vote in TORT reform to limit the liability of business in law suits. Then there's Arbitration. Turns out your credit card, cell phone or even employment contracts might prevent you from suing them for whatever reason. Instead you'd have to go to arbitration which favors those being sued about 90% of the time. Like those odds???? This is pretty much the classic approach to a documentary. They open with the key story and interject with talking heads from various folk to give the viewer at least somewhat a balanced view of things. The bad guys here do look like bad guys but maybe that couldn't be helped.

This is a real eye opener. Everyone needs to see this to make certain their legislators are fighting the good fight so we are insured of having our day in court.",1374192000,2,1784,4.586206896551724
4620409,1,B00595W3MO,"Exhibit 1: McDonalds Coffee Case

They try to make a big deal that McDonalds had 700 burn complaints in ten years. But let's put that number in perspective.
 McDonalds serves 47,000,000 customers a DAY
McDonalds serves 17,155,000,000 customers a year
McDonalds serves 171,550,000,000 customers in ten years.

That means 700 out of 171 BILLION customers complained about burns, this is statistically nothing.

In fact I was involved with five restaurants when the runaway jury awarded this ridiculous amount. By the end of that week we had 52 lawsuits filed against our restaurants for burns received from hot food and over 500 burn complaints called in threatening to file a lawsuit. I think McDonalds record of ONLY 700 in ten years is pretty damn amazing. The irony is that the McDonald's executive said this very same thing, WOW look at that, that is one hell of a good record, yet the idiot juror thought that number was terrible.

Probably the scariest part of the film wasn't the greedy family that sued or the greedy lawyer but the complete idiocy of the jurors. One juror talked about the that McDonalds coffee had burned other people (duh - it's a hot liquid) and McDonalds had done nothing about it. What should they do - serve it cold????? Then nobody would buy it. When you buy coffee you expect it to be hot, plain and simple. What is going to be next if I buy a gun and then shoot myself in my leg can I sue the gun manufacturer for selling me a dangerous product.

FACT: Older people's skin are much less resilient to burns because their skin is much thinner.
FACT:  She was wearing tight cotton sweatpants that soaked in the coffee and held it against her skin exacerbating the burn.
FACT: It took over 15 seconds of constant contact with her skin to produce those burns. All she needed to do was to lift her sweatpants (or pull them down) so they did not contact her skin and she would have reduced the burns.
FACT: After she spilt the coffee on  herself she did nothing to mitigate the burns.
FACT: McDonalds sells its coffee at the industry standard temperature according to the National Coffee Association
FACT: Starbucks sells its coffee (as do the 5 other largest coffee retailers) at the same temperature.
FACT: The Specialty Coffee Association of America says that McDonalds coffee is at the correct temperature and in FACT is in the middle range with quite a few retailers selling it hotter.

So what did McDonalds do wrong,? It sold its coffee at the normal and customary temperature that customers demand they do and they jury said that is wrong and awarded 2.7 Million in punitive damages, let's review what punitive damages are:

Punitive damages or exemplary damages are damages intended to reform or deter the defendant and others from engaging in conduct similar to that which formed the basis of the lawsuit. (wikipedia). The jury wanted to reform McDonalds from serving it's coffee at the normal customary temperature. Right there you have to wonder about the IQ of these jurors, I bet if they were served a lukewarm coffee they would complain, yet that is what they are trying to get McDonalds to.

Did McDonalds change the temperature that they served their coffee? They lowered it 10 degrees but after numerous complaints put it back to industry standards so it served at the exact same temperature. But they did add a nice big warning label to your cup of coffee that warns you that it is hot and can cause burns.

One of the most insane comments came from a juror when they said that $2.7 Million dollars was a ""very small"" amount. Maybe this person is a billionaire but I'm sorry $2.7 million dollars is huge and why are you penalizing a company for selling a product at the correct temperature? Luckily the Trial judge reduced this runaway juries amount to $480,000, so some sort of common sense prevailed.

Tort Reform

Lots of falsehoods put forth in this film

#1 Tort Reform does NOT limit your ability to file a lawsuit.
#2 Tort reform does NOT restrict your right to go to court.
#3 Tort reform does NOT stop you from getting punitive damges
#4 Tort reform does NOT stop you from holding the company responsible.

Who is against tort reform - Lawyers, specifically personal injury lawyers who make their money off of suing anybody and anyone they can. The fact is almost all first world nations, including all socialized European nations, Australia and New Zealand have reformed their tort laws. America's tort laws are arcane, complex, filled with legalism and loopholes, they benefit the lawyers first and foremost and since most lawmakers are lawyers they generally refuse to change the laws that made them rich in the first place. The real losers in America's system are the everyday people and consumers because American companies have the highest litigation costs and highest insurance costs in the world. ALL of this must be passed onto the consumer.  So when you see that ambulance chasing attorney driving by in his Rolls Royce you can smile knowing that you helped pay for that car.

I had to laugh at the obligatory attack on Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Karl Rove.

Exhibit 2: The Gourley case

They really picked the wrong example IMHO, but I also know why they did, babies are the most innocent of all and it's easy to let your emotions run rampant. That's why there are so many lawsuits against OBGYN's, because lawyers pray on our emotions rather than our brains.

FACT: OBGYN's have the highest malpractice insurance rates, sometimes topping over $400,000 per year.
FACT: OBGYN's get sued more than any other doctor.
FACT: The average OBGYN has one lawsuit 2.5 years.
FACT: There are lawyers that specialize in suing OBGYN for ANY birth defect.
FACT: The movie tried to make hay that Lisa's doctor had been sued twice before - well if she had been practicing for just 5 years she would be right on track with the national average

Let's look at the case, Lisa was a high risk pregnancy,  twin boys with only one placenta, the pregnancy had complications when one of the boys did not receive enough oxygen. This could have been discovered earlier if Lisa  would have allowed her doctor to perform an ultrasound but unfortunately she refused, a key FACT that  was not allowed to be presented to the jury.  It wasn't till two days later when the movement had all but ceased that she was talked into an ultrasound that showed the problem.  An emergency C-Section was ordered but due to the insurance requirements of the hospital (forced on them by other lawsuits - oh the irony) the only doctor that could perform it was 2 hours away.

FACT: Colin suffered from brain damage due to Lisa not having two placenta's.
FACT: The runaway jury found that the Doctor caused the brain injury and awarded them 5.6 Million dollars in damages.

Luckily Nebraska has a cap on runaway jury awards, so this amount was reduced. The bottom line is that all first world nations, including socialized nations have caps on awards. America is the only country that this is even debated rather than just being a common sense but the movie never told you this.

While what happened to their son is tragic let's look at the emotional claims that are made. According to the parents the caps on lawsuits have prevented their son from:

""Never be able to grow up and earn his own living""
""Never go off to college""
""Never have his own family""
""Never getting off of care for the rest of his life""

I'm not trying to be rude or insensitive here but their son could have gotten 1 trillion dollars and none of those things would change. He had a terrible brain injury and NO amount of money is going to make him better and that's just the cold hard truth.

The bottom line is that they tried to play this as a moral issue, if you cap damages you ""relieve the wrong-doer from the responsibility they have for the damage they caused."" But this is completely FALSE logic, the doctor didn't pay, the insurance company did, they then look at the amount they paid over the year and increase rates accordingly. The increased rates are passed along to the ultimate consumer, you and me through rate hikes.

Exhibit 3: Judge Diaz

The spin in this chapter about all powerful Chamber of Commerce VS the lowly trial lawyers was just ridiculous

According to OpenSecrets.org on their ""top all time donors, 1989-2012"" list those giving money to support the trial lawyers had five out of the top ten spots on the list, including the American Association for Justice being in the top ten. And this all powerful Chamber of congress that is fighting them didn't even make the top 150.

The claim that you can only give $5,000 personally is true but the FACT is that trial lawyers can give unlimited money to their associations who then can spend it on their behest. They follow the EXACT same rules that the chamber of commerce does so the film really misled people when it tried to claim otherwise.

Just one comment about Judge Diaz - he ruled that Prudential Insurance had to pay out $36.4 Million on a $1 million life insurance policy he was TRYING to obtain. The FACT is the policy  that was NOT in effect. Not only was the policy NOT in effect when the person died, the person trying to get insurance was a physician who LIED on the medical form claiming he had never had a stroke, which is another reason that the policy could be voided IF it was ever issued. Finally the physician was in a coma at the hospital when the insurance company came to his son with a counteroffer at a much higher premium because of the likelihood of death. This policy was also NEVER executed but Judge Diaz felt the son should be awarded NOT the $1 Million of the original policy but a whopping $36.4 Million. So not only do we have runaway jurors we also have runaway judges.

Exhibit 4: Mandatory Arbitration - Jamie Lee Jones

So much misinformation in this ""Exhibit"" I don't know where to start.

#1 Nobody is ""FORCED"" to sign arbitration clauses, in fact if you don't want to sign it you don't have to, it's your choice. So the FACT is you choose to sign it.
#2 Every attorney knows that if you have a real case you can sidestep the arbitration clause and sue. It's done hundreds if not thousands of times everyday so don't believe the BS they are feeding you.
#3 After watching several stories about people suing do you really believe that you can't sue???? If you can't sue as they claim why is tort reform such a big deal???? Oh that's right because this is a bunch of BS. Even their story about Jamie Jones involves her SUING even though she had a arbitration clause.

You also have to question about their choice of highlighting the Jamie Lee Jones case. Did they filmmakers  do a background check or were they just hoping that the audience was really stupid and easily duped? Here are some facts that they film forgot to mention

* Ms. Jones was being treated for bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety.
* Ms. Jones had reported that she had been raped on TWO prior occasions, both times it was determined she had lied.
* Ms. Jones told fellow employees that she hated it there after ONE day and she was going to get out of her contract.
* Ms. Jones claimed she was drugged and gang-raped.
* Ms. Jones claimed that her chest was beaten and her breast implants were ruptured.
* Ms. Jones claimed she was bleeding vaginally and anally.
* A rape kit was administered and photographs were taken, this kit was turned over THREE hours later to the state department that had been notified. NOTE: The film falsely claims that Halliburton lost part of the rape kit when in fact it was the US government that misplaced a part of it.
* Pictures of her chest taken (breast implants fully intact) showed no sign of trauma less than 12 hours after the supposed event.
* Pictures of her female parts showed no trauma and no blood.
* Ms. Jones claimed she had to have reconstructive pectoral surgery when in fact she never had any.
* Blood tests showed no drugs in her system even though she claimed she could still feel them.
* Ms. Jones claims that after the rape she was locked in  a unconditioned shipping container, but the reality was she was moved to secure air-conditioned location and armed guards were assigned to her to protect her. The state department had been c called and arrangements were being made to fly her home to Texas as she requested.
* The movie claimed that state department had to rescue Ms Jones from KBR custody when in fact the state department had been informed by KBR  and agents were already in route from the Embassy.
* Although Ms. Jones was only 19, the jury was allowed to hear about her rather impressively long list of men she had slept with from age 18 on.
* The Jury also heard the lasciviousness details about her trading sex for breast implants on her 18th birthday.
* Testimony was heard that Ms. Jones was having consensual sex the FIRST night she was there.

The FACT is twelve jurors got to hear all the evidence and they called BS.

NOTE: Al Franken comes off as self-serving useful Idiot, never questioning and championing a bi-polar sex crazed young girl who has a history of making up rape charges. Franken even goes on record claiming she was gang-raped and had reconstructive surgery even though he KNEW  this was false.  And to think that this man is a US Senator who brazenly lies on camera knowing that most Americans are too lazy or stupid to check shows us his arrogance. But even more mind-numbing was the short but stupid comment that Senator Leahy made. I cannot believe that this is the quality of our representatives, I guess we get the government we deserve since we vote for these dunderheads.

NOTE: Not quite sure why the editors let this one slip in but they did.

4620412,3,B00595W3MO,"I had a great time watching Hot Coffee.  The arguments put forth were well-argued, consistently engaging, and generally noble.  In its attempts to dispel public misconceptions (many of which I shared) about the urban legends surrounding high-profile lawsuits and the Tort Reform movement, I thought the film connected on just about every swing.  I was shocked by the degree of injury suffered by the plaintiff in the infamous McDonalds lawsuit.  I was enraged by the manipulative media politics of Karl Rove, as evinced in the judicial election drama in Mississippi.  I was even, surprisingly, in Al Franken's corner as he endeavored to eliminate binding arbitration clauses from governmental sub-contracts.  For what it is, a mass-market expose on some very troubling and generally misunderstood developments in government today, I thought Hot Coffee was an excellent civic contribution.
That being said, some inconsistencies do bubble up beneath the film's bold and frothy surface.  By attempting to dispel the ""frivolous lawsuit"" argument with three anecdotal cases in which lawsuits were not frivolous (convincing as they were), Hot Coffee sidesteps the fact that frivolous lawsuits actually do exist in some cases.  Is the viewer somehow supposed to assume that all lawsuits are fully merited?  This is the big blind spot of the film.  Furthermore, the filmmakers reduce the entire concept of ""legal reform"" to an instance of covert corporate lobbyist doublespeak.  It's a very effective, but tired, good versus evil model employed by just about every filmmaker of the ilk (Michael Moore, Morgan Spurlock, etc...)**  Thus, a laudable expose on a pressing social evil is undermined by a pervasive self-righteousness and consequent superficiality.
In the case of Hot Coffee, thankfully, we don't get a disgruntled everyman narrator (I'm going to ignore the Seinfeld cameo). What we do get is just about every other ""modern doc"" trope you can imagine.  On a covert filming trip, the nephew of the hot coffee plaintiff actually goes back to the original McDonalds location and politely pays for a coffee!  I was embarrassed when I was the only one who laughed when he said ""Thank You.""  Though, for me, it might have been the highlight of the film.  In other scenes the film crew employs paparazzi-style interview techniques to engage representatives of the other side right before they go into the courthouse to write a big red X on the constitution.  Since the bad guy (Rove) always declines to be interviewed for the film, we get some awkward picture of him laughing on a golf course (or somewhere) instead.  People are quizzed on the street, just like on Jay Leno... Etcetera.  You've seen these cutting edge techniques in editorial-journalism before.  They're used here.  They're effective.  So effective, I'm wondering if it's a coincidence that I'm watching this in an election season.

4620413,5,B00595W3MO,"Hot Coffee is a captivating documentary that takes a comprehensive look at tort reforms that limit the rights of individuals to sue in court or get proper compensation for damages because of caps on what they can receive. To achieve this, filmmaker Susan Saladoff uses concrete examples of legal cases in which plaintiffs have been harmed by big business defendants. There's little new information I can add about this film because of the many great reviews here; but I will say that the film is never boring nor do they use mysterious, cryptic words we often hear when legal cases are discussed. In addition, the interview footage is eye-opening and often very sad.

Although so many reviews are here already, there are some things that made a strong impression on me. I learned a lot about the case in which an elderly woman sued McDonald's after she spilled hot coffee on her lap. I thought this was a frivolous lawsuit until I watched this film and saw for myself the photos of her third degree burns--difficult to recover from when one is elderly. This poor woman had to undergo surgery, skin grafts and more and for the rest of her life she couldn't walk normally. She was awarded a rather large settlement but it was greatly reduced. McDonald's couldn't wait to pounce, turning the whole thing around to present the case to the public as if it had been a frivolous lawsuit. This was then used as an example of why we needed ""tort reform."" Moreover, McDonald's finally settled with the woman out of court in a ""hush-hush"" manner that spared McDonald's public embarrassment.

There's also the story of a young woman employed by a subsidiary of Halliburton; she went overseas to serve our nation but instead she was gang rap*d and locked up--and then had to go through mandatory arbitration instead of getting her day in court! She's psychologically scarred, perhaps for life, and she has no access to a court of law and a jury of her peers because she had to sign a clause (in very fine print) requiring her to resolve legal differences between her and her employer through closed door arbitration with an arbitration company picked by the employer. Naturally, the arbitrator sides with the employer and not the plaintiff because they want repeat ""business"" from that employer!

Look also for heartbreaking sections on how mandatory caps on compensation leave a couple without enough money for their brain-damaged son to be properly cared for after they've passed away and how a judge was harassed and dragged through the courts for more than three years because big business and ""the powers that be"" didn't like that he tended to side with the plaintiff and not big business defendants in court. The United States Chamber of Congress is also exposed for what it really is. (Hint: It's not part of the government.)

The DVD comes with a few brief extras. I particularly liked the interview with filmmaker Susan Saladoff and ""Take Action: What You Can Do.""

Hot Coffee is a fine documentary about tort reform and how people are victimized by big business as a result. The short answer is that all too often people simply don't get their day in court; but of course the film explores that further. I highly recommend this film for anyone studying the criminal justice system and mandatory arbitration; and anyone who likes documentaries with political, social and even cultural themes will not be disappointed.",1348790400,4,3413,4.837328767123288

Absolutely appalling!  A national disgrace!  This documentary exposes them for the scum bags they are.  Everyone old enough to comprehend should see this very important film. A lesson not to blindly trust the system you live in and leave it up to others to get it right. Everyone should educate themselves about our politics and judicial system and you will vote differently.
 And Haliburton...this is where our hard earned tax dollars go, to support monsters like them. The public should certainly have a voice in civil jury service to police them. Yet they effectively shut out the very public who funnel money to them. These big corporations deserve exposure so the public has the option to stop buying their products.  I would really like to see televised campaign attack ads become illegal to air unless they can be fully proven. And stop corporate's ability to fund these ads  and to greatly influence the judicial system.
 Bravo to Senator Al Franken who has lent his great voice and mind to real justice. I also appreciate author John Grisham more than ever for his exposure of judicial scams.

4620416,5,B00595W3MO,"I can tell you first hand the part about arbitration is 100% true. I naively signed a contract that included the provision assuming the arbiter is an officer of the court. They are not, they are there to represent the corporations.  I spent 4 years making an animated film and was robbed by my partner, he literally entered my house and robbed me. I have so far spent 3 years trying to get him to honor contracts. We are 6+ contracts into this mess and they haven't honored one yet. I went through arbitration a year ago and was stunned when the arbiter raked me over the coals and treated the other party like old friends. The case was so blatant that he had little choice but to find in my favor but even though I won he stripped me of all rights and made it impossible to collect on the judgement which was half what the contracts guaranteed me. I'm talking the later contracts since the original ones gave me half of all rights and revenues from the film. I was stunned and couldn't understand how it could have happened. Then I saw Hot Coffee and was in shock. The second half of the film paralleled my case. Arbiters work for the corporations not you. That's why they demand those clauses. I would never sign another contract of that sort and would rather work in a Starbuck for the rest of my life. They aren't trying to get rid of frivolous lawsuits they are trying to get rid of ALL lawsuits making them not responsible for their actions. After going through it myself I know first hand Tort Reform is about stripping citizens of Constitutional rights to protect corporations. If you believe the right wing corporate party line then you are a sucker and pray it doesn't happen to you because you have no rights the way god and George W Bush intended!",1337904000,3,1759,4.429012345679013
4620417,5,B00595W3MO,"I don't give many 5 star reviews, but Hot Coffee deserves it. It was moving, eloquent, powerful, and convincing. I actually nearly started crying near the end. There are basically 4 documentaries into one here, with one overall theme: corporations are destroying our judicial system with massive campaign contributions to pro-business politicians. The second part was the most moving to me; it detailed the pain caused to a family whose lives were shattered because of caps placed on malpractice liability. (The doctor's negligence caused brain damage to their son, but they could not recou enough money to pay for all his bills). The next time you hear a TV commmercial arguing for ""tort reform,"" check out the advertiser's funding. It's almost certainly big business interests buying their airtime.

Although the producers did not emphasize this point, Hot Coffee showed conservative politicians at their most hypocritical-- denouncing price caps in almost every other area of life, but demanding limitations on jury-alloted damages.",1336694400,2,1035,5.428571428571429
4620418,5,B00595W3MO,"I strongly recommend ""Hot Coffee"" as an eye-opener for the problems of media misinformation, legislative and judicial manipulation, and citizen disenfranchisement. I think the film presents its information in a clear and engaging way, and it's so important because the issue pertains to anyone in this country who can be wronged and deserve equitable compensation (i.e., you and those you love). I, too, had formerly held a vague ""understanding"" of the ""frivolous"" hot coffee lawsuit, but I've since learned that I knew NOTHING about it. If you're wondering since seeing the trailer: yes, you will be shown graphic photos of the injuries Stella Liebeck sustained. It's important, because it can really wake you up to the fact that there are legitimate claims out there, and there can be a chasm between reality and what the media and ""pundits"" report.

I'm in the middle of watching the film again (good documentaries deserve more than one viewing), and I'm enjoying getting a better understanding of the problem -- though it seems so formidable. There's an especially good clip where a Representative on a small business committee is questioning the sense of legislating caps on damages, rather than leaving compensation the province of the courts and juries. The film is great in that it encourages viewers to be [more] critical of the information that they consume, and I believe it effectively communicates the problem that we are hobbling the innocent and earnest in our haste to hobble the thieves.

Speaking of misinformation, since you're probably trying to learn if this film is worth seeing or buying (as you're reading a review), you'll likely find that there is some criticism (a single 1-star ""review"" at this time) and negative comments. I have addressed some of this negativity at length, as replies under the reviews of ""E. Hernandez"" and ""J. lesch"". I have found dismissals of this film, especially concerning the Jamie Jones case, to be quite poorly supported.

So, I say to you that I found it very much a worthwhile watch. I believe it deserves more publicity and views, with such an important issue presented so well.

This documentary blows the socks off the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its clients, like Big Tobacco and Big Pharma, who for almost two decades have laughed at the little old lady who was so horribly burned by McDonald's scalding-hot coffee (190-degrees), and the court and jury in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who awarded damages to her (Mrs. Stella Liebeck).

""HOT COFFEE"" is a documentary -- meaning it is a presentation of the actual, true facts that the jury in that case heard and analyzed in a court of law.

The award of that jury was politicized by the US Chamber of Commerce for one reason:  to engage in jury-tampering on a national basis, by convincing American citizens who form the various jury pools in counties througout the land that corporations like McDonalds should not be held legally accountable for their negligent mistakes  -- even if the wrongdoing kills someone like Ms. Liebeck (who ultimately did pass away).

Anyone who has heard about that ""little old lady who sued McDonalds for spilling coffee on herself"" will be shocked when he or she sees ""HOT COFFEE"" and learns the truth.

I've bought this documentary and now await its delivery.  I plan to show the documentary to students in my marketing classes--undergraduate and MBA students.  The documentary brings to mind a sentence in Garrison Keilor's Home Grown Democrat (book) about the evil of the Republican national platform.  With the support of big business interests, ""tort reform"" (really ""tort deform"" as Ralph Nadar identifies it) is almost impossible to stop.  Too much money is behind the movement to pass ""tort reform"" laws to stop these campaigns from succeeding--especially when a Republican is in the White House.  G W Bush appears in the documentary delivering a speech on ""tort reform"" with teenagers and young adults appearing behind him--they reallyl know not what they are doing there.

Tort payments represents very small percentages of profits for the firms found guilty of doing such harm in court cases involving torts.  The documentary deserves a follow-up documentary confirming this point. Juries are making sound judgments.

HOT COFFEE is a brilliant expose that shows us how the disgusting business of politics, greed and corruption isn't about THEM, it's about US.

This film is not just about the McDonalds coffee case (We see that at the time, McDonalds had over 700 cases of burn complaints from the coffee served in their restaurants and we also see the horrific burns suffered by the 79 year old woman,  how the press manipulated the case and the woman was made to look like a gold digger) but also explores the stories of individuals who were negatively affected by so-called tort reform laws.

I wish every American would watch this film to understand how their views have been manipulated and their legal rights have been hijacked by the concerted efforts of highly paid corporate lobbyists.

I've known most of the true story of Stella Lieback for years -- but I had never seen the photos of her injuries.  After hearing the whole story and seeing the cruel way she was treated -- you realize that a campaign of distortion had to be behind it.  The first time I saw Hot Coffee I was mad.  The second time I was very sad.  What the Chamber of Commerce, business interests, and Karl Rove have done to civil justice in our country is shameful and to the people they have hurt, it is horrifying.  I knew about caps on damages in some states, but I didn't realize how far it had gone.  Caps on damages in medical malpractice cases leave many people who have been severely injured no where to turn.  The worst part of all of this is that so many Americans have bought into the idea of ""jackpot"" justice.  What injured people want is accountability, that doesn't mean someone to blame, that means holding people responsible when they harm someone.

I agree with the reviewer that this movie should be shown in all schools -- maybe as part of the civics curriculum?  do they even teach that anymore?",1315440000,13,1263,4.35042735042735

8462736,5,B00595W3MO,"After 6 years I decided to watch Hot Coffee 6 again. I think it is as relevant as ever. It is about the battle by companies to make it more difficult to use the civil legal system (law suits) to hold business to account. Also known at tort reform a number of mechanisms have been used. Perhaps the most common is forced arbitration (often where the company chooses the arbitrator).

Hot Coffee is a snappy title, but the title incident in the movie is just one of several used to illustrate how corporations use every means possible to discredit prevent a person from even getting to court. In the title example is the woman who was burned by hot McDonald's coffee and was the subject of a media campaign to make her look like a crank. when she was awarded $2 million for her injuries. In contrast to the corporate campaign to trivialize her injuries they were actually rather severe.

The examples are from 6+ years ago and yet still apply today.

In 2017 I think Hot Coffee is worth taking a watch. Congress is still working on unfair forced arbitration clauses being used to remove the legal system as a avenue of recourse for the consumer. In the last 6 years not much has improved for consumers ability to get recourse.

Because it's (sadly) still so relevant today I'm giving Hot Coffee 5 solid stars.",1508803200,,1307,4.52542372881356
