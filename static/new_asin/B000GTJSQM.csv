2617845,4,B000GTJSQM,"Will the TV movies be released separately?  People have paid good money for each individual season and don't want to buy the whole set just to obtain the movies.  If that is the case, it looks like Paramount is no different than Fox and most of the other major companies in what they are doing.",1185840000,6,294,4.327272727272727
2617846,2,B000GTJSQM,"I bought each and every season of this show as soon as it came out.  I have all 7 seasons, and am waiting for the 2 TV movies to be put out.  Now they are coming out with the entire series, which is supposed to include the tv movies, but no seperate release of the TV movies.  I am mad.  They should give us the tv movies seperately as several people paid out good money for each season release.  Boo Paramount!!

I just saw this set at Target.  Yes folks, the tv movies are in the complete series set.  Again, why not release the movies seperately as well?",1185494400,22,557,4.092592592592593

2617849,5,B000GTJSQM,"I've had my fair share of cringeworthy experiences with catching an episode of an old favorite show on cable - within ten minutes I'm wondering why I ever enjoyed it when I was a kid.  ""MacGyver"" isn't one of them.  Just about any episode from any season is enough to remind me why I loved going along for the ride back then, and I still do.

Of course, I knew even as a teenager that he was a bit goody goody - ordering milk at a bar, never eating junk food, trying to reason gently with an ex-girlfriend who just tried to murder him, and yet he doesn't always wear his seatbelt - but it's all part of the fun.  So are the occasional plot holes, which of course are a bit more noticeable this time around.  I also seem to recall thinking as a kid that the show became less about gadgets and more about teaching life lessons in later seasons, but I now see that even the earliest episodes often had morality issues and the later seasons still had quite a bit of gadgetry to their credit.  It's really a pretty consistent formula across all seven seasons.

The only problem with this set is that, if you're a fan, chances are you already bought at least a few other seasons separately.  All seven of them are worth having, in any case, whether it's cheaper to fill in the blanks one by one or buy the entire set here.",1169596800,51,1316,4.236
2617850,4,B000GTJSQM,"I bought this to watch with my wife and 13 year old son. I like that MacGyver is an uncorrupted hero. The DVD quality is great. I didn't watch the series in first run, so it's new to me. I still like when the DVD tells th origenil air date, and this one does not. But I am completely satisfied.",1168387200,5,294,3.9166666666666665
2617851,5,B000GTJSQM,"I am definitely enjoying having every single episode of MacGyver ever made.  The man is a genius and I am looking forward to reviewing the best way to defuse a bomb using duct tape, a paper clip, and some gum.",1168300800,2,209,4.225

2617866,5,B000GTJSQM,"Being a huge MacGyver fan, (I blame this on my daughter lol) and finding out that Netflix was planning to remove the series from its line-up, this was a must have for our DVD collection! This particular collection surprised us because at first we thought the box holding the DVDs had been duct taped! Not so. In true MacGyver style the marketing geniuses made it appear as though duct tape was holding the box together...clever!
Inside EACH DVD has its own separate divider to protect it. All seasons were included along with a bonus dvd and leaflet with the titles of each episode. Bonuses and convenience all in one flamboyant box! We are in Mac-Heaven!",1469836800,,655,4.7043478260869565

2617873,5,B000GTJSQM,This is the complete series for MacGyver and contains all the episodes from all seven seasons.  This show is based on one man going wherever he is needed to solve everyday problems and works for the government and then for a private organization.  He is able to go where he wants and gets bonuses for each job completed.  He gets to meet all kinds of people through all walks of life and every touches on issues relevant to society.  This is a great program for people who like making things out of nothing and having creativity and imagination.,1455926400,,545,4.530612244897959
2617874,5,B000GTJSQM,My son loved this show while he was growing up.  He was collecting the individual seasons as he found them in the store.

I think he's glued to the tv screen!,1454457600,,297,3.8360655737704916

2617888,5,B000GTJSQM,"The discs came in a decent box type inclosure with picutres of duct tape.  Very ""MacGyverish.""  Having seen most of the series when it first aired, I was quite surprised, and amused, at what I had forgotten.  Richard Dean certainly is MacGyver.  Even more so than his part on Stargate.
I believe anyone over the age of 15 would enjoy watching this series.  It is most intreguing since just about every one of Mac's ways of getting out of the difficult situations has an air of authenticity.",1437782400,,490,4.586206896551724

2617892,3,B000GTJSQM,"Love the first shows....but then, they had to get political.  The later shows are all trying to teach you something, rather than just a fun show to enjoy.  Wish they'd stayed on the original path, though, because of the time that's past, you do have to laugh at the antiquated, anachronistic concerns for the era.  How many crisis' have changed, been ignored, or just forgotten.  (Been a long time since I'd heard the term ""acid rain"").  Anyway, a fun show and good value.

The box does not fit in my DVD storage cabinet and takes up mega room on my bookshelf.

2617944,4,B000GTJSQM,"We had watched MacGyver when it was on in the 1980's but had forgotten about it until I saw some episodes at my Daughter's house and immediately ordered the series on DVD.  (They have Amazon Prime and this is included in their subscription.)

Details:
MacGyver The Complete Series includes 139 episodes on 38 discs (DVD) plus 2 movies on 1 disc.
Cost (thru Amazon):  $64.80.  If each season plus movies were bought separately (from Amazon) they would total $111.01 so this is a savings of $47.11

Seasons 1-4 are in one box and seasons 5-7 plus the movies are in another box.  Both boxes are in a larger box which also includes an episode guide, which lists the season, disc number, episode name and brief description.  There is a separator between each disc.

Negatives:
The shows have not been re-mastered so they are somewhat grainy.

On the Amazon page for ""MacGyver - The Complete Series"", it shows this series is ""Frequently Bought Together"" with the TV Movies DVD - but the Movies DVD is included in the Series.

Amazon has a 30 day return/replacement policy and this box set has 39 discs so you have to watch an average of more than one disc per day to get through them before the 30 days are up.

2617950,5,B000GTJSQM,"If you love MacGyver (or Richard Dean Anderson), you will love this collection.  It has every TV show from the series AND it includes the two MADE FOR TV MOVIES.  These are included on a single disc at the end of Season 7.  I had never seen the movies and was delighted to see one of my favorite Shakespearean actors, Brian Blessed, playing a lead role.  He is so wonderful, and overflowing with energy and enthusiasm- a perfect match for MacGyver.  The second Movie was also well-done and packed with well-known English actors.  What I was hoping for was an improvement in the quality from the ""downloads"".  There definitely is more clarity, not to mention, there is NEVER any ""buffering"", or getting ""booted"" off of a program in the middle, which tends to happen to me.  It is fun to have control of what I watch, and know that the quality will always be great (plus I can FF if I feel like it).",1403049600,,897,4.426829268292683

We thought we'd have to buy each season separately (which would have been expensive), so I was very happy to see The Complete Series at such a bargain price on Amazon and bought it right away.

I bought the set of DVDs so that I can continue to show MacGyver to him and to my other grandchildren.

2618045,1,B000GTJSQM,"*** This original review is for the Macgyver Complete Series DVD set which comes packaged in a single bigger box. Read through for the review of the OTHER set called the Macgyver Complete Series Pack Gift Set, which is simply the individually available Seasons 1 through 7 boxsets wrapped together in cellophane.

To avoid disappointment and frustration, my recommendation is to get the Pack Gift Set + the 2 movie disc separately rather than the one-box Complete Series set.

***original review of the 1-box Macgyver: The Complete Series set***
I got this a little over a month ago, but unfortunately, was busy and only just opened it up recently (past the return period). I have to agree with the other reviewers who commented that the packaging on this is terrible. When you open the large main outer box, there are 2 smaller boxes inside the main outer box. The discs are contained in these 2 smaller boxes. The problem is that the discs are only separated from each other by half-height cardboard dividers (the cardboard dividers are only half the height of the diameter of a disc), and the discs are loose to move around in the box. As a result, more than half of them are scratched up, and can't play without stuttering and freezing.

In addition, even when I'm lucky enough to get whole episodes or discs to play without glitches due to all the scratches, the video quality is pretty atrocious. I fully understand that this is 480 resolution and not 1080p high definition, but I have a LOT of DVD discs and they definitely aren't this blurry. The quality is bad enough that it looks like the discs were mastered off someone's video cassette copies recorded off the TV broadcasts back in the 80's when the series originally aired.

As I said, unfortunately, due to working out of town and being busy, I did not find all this out till after the Return window, but I'll advise anyone considering purchasing this set to AVOID it like the plague.

I'm not sure what the video quality of the other MacGyver set is like, but at the very least, the keepcases should ensure that your brand new set of discs doesn't arrive all scratched up.

***add-on review of the MacGyver: The Complete Series Pack Gift Set

The 3 IMPORTANT points to note:
1) since this set is simply all the 7 individual season boxsets packaged/wrapped together in cellophane, each disc is safely secured in the numerous slim plastic keepcases. That means no scratched up discs unlike the other set.
2) this set DOESN'T include the 2 movies. You'll have to get that disc separately ($5.99 on Amazon at the time of this revision of my review)
3) the Pack Gift Set usually lists for around $100-$120. The 1-box Complete Set usually lists anywhere between $8x to as low as $6x on occasion. Based on the fact that approximately 80-90% of the discs in the 1-box set I received were scratched up AND that many of these were scratched up enough to make the playback stutter and/or freeze at some point, the 1-box set isn't worth the savings. Save yourself the frustration and get the 7-season Pack Gift Set (+ the additional 2 movie DVD).",1347580800,6,3100,4.666666666666667

2618048,4,B000GTJSQM,"My family and I looked forward to watching the McGyver series.  We were somewhat disappointed in that the first disk of the set had problems--it did not play well.  So far, the second disk seems to be doing okay, so I hope the rest will be quality recordings.

For the most part, we like the content of the DVDs we have seen.  It is fun to see how the main character finds creative ways to solve problems through his knowledge of science, etc.  However, we had hoped there would not be any curse words in the shows.  Hearing them does not in any way advance the reality of the show.  Contrary to the belief of some, there are large groups of our society who recognize that intelligent minds do not need curse words to adequately express themselves.",1347321600,2,748,4.416058394160584
2618049,4,B000GTJSQM,"This complete series of MacGyver is exactly what I wanted. Every episode plus the 2 tv movies. Unfortunately, Paramount chose to release MacGyver in all formats with seasons 1 & 2 with mono sound. I can understand that every episode is full screen because tv's weren't 16x9 yet. I can also understand the fact that there is no extra features, interviews, commentaries.... nothing except the episodes. The biggest peeve I have is there are no closed captioning included and being that I only have HDMI cables hooked up, I get no captioning on my tv from the player. The set is worth buying if you want all MacGyver and don't want to pay the price per individual season and don't mind the dvd's being crammed into a cardboard box with little protection. Luckily, my discs came in great condition. I might transfer to a different sleeve later on. 4 stars because of Paramount's decision not to upgrade sound or captioning and for poor protection of discs. 5 stars on MacGyver itself.",1347148800,,980,4.7368421052631575

It will take awhile to view all the scuffed and scratched DVDs to know if luck was on my side, or not.

UPDATE: Oh yes, I had several bad episodes!  It is sad because it was unnecessary damage that could have been avoided if the distributors cared enough to package their product in a different manner.

MacGyver is one of my favorite shows from when I was a kid.  Never really understood it, but now I do.  It is a very educational show as well.  He takes stuff out of no where and combines it to make different things.  So if your ever in a situation where a car is chasing you with guns and won't back off, just cut off your muffler, drain a little gasoline from the line, cut open your backseat of your cadillac, stuff some fiberloft in there, put a steering wheel knob at the end, and put a inline fuse, then use your cigarette lighter to light the fuse.  Now, you have a home made cannon to deter the bad guys.  It's truly amazing some of the stuff he comes up with.  If your a pyro-maniac, I suggest you look elsewhere, because it can give you bad ideas.  But if your mature and like action, this show has plenty of it.

Richard Dean Anderson's performance was artfully done as the agreeably friendly, laid back yet action hero title character. Blessed with more knowledge than any previous jack of all trades, when called upon MacGyver could fix or demolish (as needed) whatever was necessary to save himself, his boss Pete Thornton (played wonderfully by the late Dana Elcar), errant pilot and friend Jack Dalton (played by the versatile actor Bruce McGill) and whatever delightful endangered lovely he might be romantically involved with in the current episode from a pantheon of dastardly no-goodniks (like Murdock). My personal favorite recurring female character on the show was Penny Parker--wasn't she something?

As a writer of science fiction and horror I have been exposed for many decades (is it that long?) to some great and some not-so-great written and filmed work but I put MacGyver on my personal top shelf.

Not only that but in 25% or more of the episodes, the DVD just freezes, and starts playing the entire episode over again from the beginning.  There is no way to fast forward or skip the broken parts, and why should you have to?  You paid for the whole season, but you'll be lucky to view 3/4 of it.  A rip off.

2618097,5,B000GTJSQM,"i bought macgyver season by season just as soon as i discovered the show had been placed on dvd. when i began buying the seasons, the series was not yet offered in its entirety yet. therefore obviously somehow or other i managed not to get the movies. now, does anyone know how i can get the movies without rebuying the series? i did inquire about the one macgyver movie i had seen in ""1993"", i believe, and no one had a clue what i was talking about, outside of the series itself. i guess this goes back to marketing. what i found irritating about the way the disc's were all set up, after each episode ended instead of the next episode kicking in, it would instead return to the main menu. and play had to be pressed to play the next epidode. in other words, there isn't a ""play all"" feature.
in spite of that irritant, i really loved this show. and i loved
""murdock."" the writer/creator of that character gave us many different facets of this character. everything from showing his human soft side when he was truly concerned about his sister's safety to the other extreme, when he was trying to come up with another way to get rid of macgyver. he was so bad, you had to love him. if you love drama, action, adventure, murder and mayhem, tune into macgyver.
this was absolutely one of the best shows to come out of the ""80's"". macgyver had everything and offered everything else: he was handsome, educated and intelligent. he was creative, innovative and could think and get himself out of any situation. if i didn't own this series, i would definitely buy it. at least then i would probably get the movies.",1243555200,,1610,4.461016949152542

The best thing about this set is that it includes both of the Macgyver movies that can be found nowhere else.  More than likely I'd say that they'll release the two movies on their own, so unless you have to have them right now I'd suggest waiting.  Now, as for the Macgyver freak I'm sure this set is well worth the cost in spite of the relatively cheap packaging.

All of the other disks had some degree of damage to them before I had taken them out of the package. The two fancy DVD booklets are horribly designed. They only offer protection to half the disk while the other half is banged around on the label side of the next disk.

I was only able to make it through the first 30 minutes of the first disc before the DVD damage interrupted my veiwing.  Upone receiving a replacement set from Amazon, I discovered that this too contained DVDs with scratches and spotted with a residue as well, rendering discs in the replacement set being unreadalbe as well.  So, like other reviewers, I agree that the cheap packaging done by the manufacturer is to blame as DVDs should not be unreadable right out of the box.

I believe that fans would even accept the tv movies as a ""disc only"" offer (no packaging) at a reasonable price... for those contacting the studio.

Regarding ""whole series"" box-sets;

I think it's a good idea, but NOT an idea that truly works at the moment. My main complaint is the amount of discs and the non-standard (LARGE) boxes used for most series. Sure, it looks nice in the store and online, but it sure doesn't fit nicely on a shelf with the rest of your DVD collection. Try putting a couple ""complete series"" box sets on a shelf and see how quickly it starts to look ridiculous!

I prefer buying individual seasons, which fit nicely on a shelf (with the rest of my collection) and ussually have better packaging. Remember that some of the ""whole season"" box sets either have the discs laying on top of each other (loose) or simply sliding into little notches in cardboard (which scratches the discs).

The true answer for whole season sets will be the increased capacity of the BLU-RAY format. Less discs, nicer box (standard size), etc. Until then, I plan to buy seasons individually.

The content:I can understand the frustration of the people who purchased each season when they came out regarding the additional movies. I am in the same boat with Stargate SG1 and the additional material that will be included in the new package coming out. It drives me crazy that the studios keep screwing over the fans this way.  Releasing limited product only in full series is unfair to the fans who buy all along.

All of the discs are stuffed together into two loose cardboard ""pockets"" (meant to resemble the pockets on MacGyver's backpack or shirt? who knows?), and aside from ths the only thing included in the box is a bare-bones episode guide that's text-only...no screen-shots, no cast or guest-star photos, not even any information on the air-dates of the episodes. On the plus side, yes, it's a great show and wonderful to have the full series and movies together all in one place. Still, knowing that Paramount has already put together a ""collectors' edition"" with all of the 7 seasons packaged individually, it's pretty underwhelming that a complete series box adds so little and leaves you with disc packaging whose durability I'd say is questionable at best. Hopefully there'll be enough people who feel the same way that Paramount makes a better effort next time.",1192579200,214,1374,4.851063829787234
2618139,5,B000GTJSQM,"I'm so excited to own this box set finally! I had purchased the first two seasons and just didn't wanna keep paying for the rest of'em because I knew at some point there would be a release like this and I'm glad about it! Macgyver is one of four shows that I always loved (Macgyver, Columbo, Sanford and Son, & The X-Files). This is an excellent collection and DOES INCLUDE THE TWO MACGYVER MOVIES!!!

I'd reccommend this to anyone who loved the show...it's well worth the price and amazon is the best place to order it from! Very reasonable price!

Wow! Now I can enjoy all of the ""Murdoc"" & ""Penny Parker"" episodes that I loved so much!!!

Pick this up!!

2618140,4,B000GTJSQM,"I love this series so I'll give it four stars no matter what.  There is one thing that would make me buy(rebuy actually) the series in this new form and that's if it has a ""Play All"" feature.  This is the one thing I miss with the sets I already have.  Please somebody who knows, tell us if this new set has Play All!!  Thanks.",1192492800,,327,3.9846153846153847
2618141,2,B000GTJSQM,"I usually borrow this show from the local library. I felt disappointed that is just recycled items all put in together. I was about to purchase the set and found out no extras? wow.. what a rip off.

Update.. I've checked the box set on 10/16/07 and for you die hard fans, they will include the 2 Macgyver TV movies on DVD. That would somewhat of a plus for you.",1192233600,2,362,4.171428571428572
2618142,1,B000GTJSQM,"i also already own every season, paid $30+ for each one and now i feel ripped off. how do you justify charging so much for each individual season when you can sell the whole set at this price?

also, no mention of the tv movies. if the tv movies are included and not released separately as well, i will sell all of my macgyver dvds and forget the show ever existed as that is complete b.s.

finally, did anyone notice yahoo has an ""in production"" listing for a macgyver movie? what's up with that are they making a theater one?",1192147200,4,527,4.26
2618143,4,B000GTJSQM,"I love MacGyver the series-I have all the volumes of the series on DVD

However this box set is just recycling whole series with NO extras. I would buy this new set if they offered something extra. Like the Mastercard ads, the 2 TV movies, a Richard Dean Anderson Interview or even a Henry Winkler (he was execute producer) interview---HOWEVER no one is smart enough to do that!

I give it 4 stars because the material is worth watching again for those who missed buying this series volume by volume.

However All the collectors are doing is buying the same I have. it is good stuff-if see my other MacGyver reviews if you don't believe me. BUT when you do a complete set, offer me an extra..like the KIng of Queen Box set did. It seems all CBS Paramount just wants to do is combine their already released series with no new extras (Like the Star Trek next Generation set). and It isn't worth it to buy stuff you already have

2618145,5,B000GTJSQM,"I found a website that states that the two movies will be in the box set. Plus if you read the number of discs shown, it says 39, well i have all seven seasons and they only contain 38 discs total, so maybe the extra disc are the movies. ??????",1187740800,2,244,3.9
2618146,4,B000GTJSQM,"Those people who bought MacGyver dvds season by season instead of
purchasing the box set missed out on two movies which were only
released in the box. Many of us are frustrated that we paid more and
supported this release only to miss out on the chance to have the
movies. I rang Paramount today, and they tell me they have a release
list as far as June, and the two movies are not on it.

However, Paramount have a dedicated line for people who want to call
and ask for dvd releases and they are keeping note of how many people
call to ask for these to be released. They are happy for you to call
them and request that the movies be released - that's what the phone
line is for.

They will ask for your name, but no other details - although you may
like to tell them if you are phoning from abroad - and they are very
friendly :-) Paramount have meetings where they discuss future
releases and the number of requests they receive is one way
they judge what the demand is. So please call!

If you would like to see the two MacGyver movies released on dvd:

1. Call Paramount on 323 956 5000 (if you are calling from outside
the US, use 001 323 956 5000).
2. Ask for ""Home Entertainment"" .
3. Ask politely for Paramount to release the two MacGyver movies for
people who don't have the boxset. That you want ""MacGyver-Lost Treasure of Atlantis"" and ""MacGyver-Trail to Doomsday""
