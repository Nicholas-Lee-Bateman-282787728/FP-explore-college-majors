8142128,5,B000HXDETO,"""One of your classmates met his death in a dormitory.""  During a less than raucous house party on campus, roommate Ken Harris (Charles Starrett) tries to cheer up his glum chum Byron (James Bush).  The lad had just received some very disturbing news from home.  The next day Ken wakes in a different dorm room to find Byron up and about, hanging outside their dorm room window.  Gosh darn it......must be suicide.  But no, a giant needle was shoved into his skull with terrific force.  He and another student set about tampering with the evidence, unstringing Byron, and rolling up the rope.  Ken calls a doctor then his dad.  Instead of the police, he calls a teacher at the college.  (Apparently in 1935 the chain of command was quite different!)  A witness comes forward and the students file that under who cares.  They gather as a group and mull it over.  Another student says he has a vital clue but choir practice comes first.  He's the second victim, needled in the auditorium.  ""Murder is a terrible thing.""  A bumpkin sheriff and his deputy are finally brought in, admitting they don't know much beyond traffic tickets.  Ken's pompous dad (Robert Warwick as Joseph Harris) takes charge and rides roughshod over the case.  More surprises and another murder occur before this convoluted crime is solved.  The motive is greed.

This movie is old-fashioned but fun.  The style of acting involved is grandiose to say the least.  I quite liked it.",1433980800,,1451,4.770161290322581
8142129,3,B000HXDETO,"The Alpha release of this Chesterfield chestnut is OK.  I would say it is about par for the course for Alpha, meaning that it looks like a transfer from a VHS copy.  There is a new wrinkle, though:  Alpha has started placing a translucent logo in the top right hand corner of the picture during the credits.  I did not see it at any other time during the movie.",1181865600,,361,4.188405797101449
