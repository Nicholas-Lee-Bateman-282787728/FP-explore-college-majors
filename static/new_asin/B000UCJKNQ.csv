8212935,5,B000UCJKNQ,"There were few actors then or now who could be so benevolent and then at the drop of a hat malevolent as Vincent Price.  His voice is soothing, his manner and eyes gentle, he's handsome, he can also be extremely terrifying because of those same traits.  Like the handsome Bundy, the madness is hidden until he ties you to the rack, then it's too late.

I feel Vinnie was at his best doing Poe, the characters all seem to have been forced into their madness by the unscrupulous actions of another.  We're unwittingly sympathetic to him, no more so than in The Pit and the Pendulum...and the Fall of the House of Usher, both Poe and Price classics.  I've never found the slow descent into madness pleasant to watch, but these are exceptions to the rule.  With Vincent Price it's almost fun in a disturbing sort of way.

My advise, get your hands on these Poe/Price classics, all of them, then treat yourself to the instant classics of Price and Dr, Phibes!  Delicious!",1358035200,,966,4.543352601156069
