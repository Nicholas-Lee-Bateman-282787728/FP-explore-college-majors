8560311,4,B00B0I9BQK,"This is a good, basic video that shows how to use pepper spray for personal self defense. It is primarily for regular citizens. It is not for police instruction, and may be too basic for those who already have a lot of self-defense training. But for the average person who just wants a good unarmed way to protect themselves it is good. Note that this video does not cover using the spray against attacking dogs and wild animals. The video is from armedresponsetraining dot com, a company that makes many self defense videos.

It is fairly well produced, but it isn't scripted, or slick, or done in a fancy studio. Former police officer and self-defense instructor Ralph Morz just gives the section lectures in a conversational way as if he is talking to a class. He explains different topics about using pepper spray, and then there are demonstrations in a gym with dummies, and a young man defending against a live attacker (Mr. Morz).

Finally there is a demonstration where both the young man and a middle aged man are sprayed in the face with pepper spray by Mr. Morz.  They are both incapacitated fairly quickly (within a few seconds) and have to be hosed off with water to recover.  Morz interviews them about how it feels to be sprayed.

The section topics include:

-Hotness measurements of pepper spray
-Pepper spray versus Mace spray
-Effects of pepper spray
-Spray patterns,packaging, safety devices
-Grip, carry methods, holsters
-Appropriate use of pepper spray and legal aspects
-How to use pepper spray
-Training drills
-What do expect and do after you spray an attacker
-What to do if you are sprayed
-Traveling with pepper spray
-Live demonstration

Note that some of these videos will come with the armedresponsetraining dot com DVD catalog insert and some don't.  The catalog insert has the complete pepper spray DVD chapter listing.  For some reason, the one on the back of the DVD doesn't list all the chapters that are on the DVD.  No big deal.",1378252800,2,1967,4.792899408284024
