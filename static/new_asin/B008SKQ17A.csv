8530261,1,B008SKQ17A,"I've become a fan of the silent rascals shorts and I bought some DVDs in hopes of upgrading from the marginal quality one finds at the internet archive.
I knew these were public domain films on DVDR, but thought it was worth the risk.

Imagine my disappointment when I discovered these are the same exact sources converted to DVD.
I expect this series is being sold by some kid operating out of his bedroom.

There's no new or unique content here, so unless you specifically want this on DVD,
I recommend you just google these titles and go for the free public domain download.

As far as the material itself, these are some of the best quality Rascals films on that site.
However Fire Fighters is only the second part of the excellent but incomplete Prelinger source.
Derby Day is quite grainy.

This one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hal-Roach-s-Rascals/dp/B000NQQ4HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hal Roach's Rascals</a>&nbsp;is cheaper and OK-ish, if a bit washed out.
It has a much better version of Derby Day, which is one of the best silent rascals shorts.

I haven't bought any of the reelclassicdvd releases yet, but I expect they're better than this because at least they do their own transfers.",1379980800,6,1247,5.2462311557788945
8530262,4,B008SKQ17A,"I did not realize this was the silent movie type, however, I kept it and enjoyed the movies anyway good purchase.",1377561600,2,113,4.428571428571429
8530263,5,B008SKQ17A,"Best movies out there.  Brings back the childhood days of innocents.  A great find, GREAT Silent shorts!! Excellent quality, by far",1373673600,3,131,5.190476190476191
8530264,5,B008SKQ17A,"This is the second great volume of ""Our Gang"" silent shorts. Although I wonder why the second short ever made ""Fire Fighters"" in on this disc rather than the first and they ought to be presented in chronological order, it's still worth a look. Jackie, Joe, Mickey, Farina and the rest of the gang are back with six two reel shorts all lasting between 15 to 25 minutes in length and today 90 years later they still generate laughs for everyone to enjoy. From their antics, to their misspelling of words in notes to teachers and on displays with some letters backward you still can't help but love the boys in the gang, oh, and Mary too who was the first lady of the group or should I say the original Darla.
  Jackie Condon was and still is my favourite member of the silent troupe; with his hair looking like it was combed with an egg-beater, his expressive eyes, his perfect button nose and his double takes of surprise are worth the price of admission. Even little Farina's eyes and expressions were priceless to watch you will root for the boys whenever they got into trouble and they always outsmarted the adults that were trying to either have fun scaring them or teach them a lesson it was the gang that turned things around in their favour. So if you are a great fan of the ""Our Gang"" shorts like I am purchase this DVD. You will not be sorry!!!",1350000000,5,1352,4.404
8530265,5,B008SKQ17A,"For fans or film buffs curious about the early days of the ""Our Gang"" series, here's six more silent treasures...
SHIVERING SPOOKS---The gang interferes with the show of phony mediums, who get their revenge by scaring the daylights out of the kids with their rigged ""supernatural"" effects. The police come to the rescue of the gang just in time. While this film is fast-moving, the ""scare"" comedy has just been done too many times, and probably better (compared to ""Shootin' Injuns"" with its cleverly imaginative ""haunted house"" tricks). Most of the laughs depend on the reactions of the kids (Farina gets so frightened, he actually turns ""white"" at one point) to really work. The best gag is a running one with frightened gang members clutching & tugging down an irate Joe Cobb's pants.
DERBY DAY---This is a bright & fun comedy where lemonade/hot dog vendors (the gang, of course) conducting business outside a real racing track sneak inside (with the help of Mary Kornman) & get the thrill of watching a genuine horse race. Inspired, they create their own ""derby race"", Our Gang-style: Recruiting various animals like dogs, goats, and mules to race. This is where the film livens up with some great visual gags, ending with a closing gag of cops chasing the kids away (they run so fast they disappear over the hill in a cloud of dust reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's ""Way Out West"" years later).
THE FOURTH ALARM---Enjoying the water recreations on a hot day, the kids put out a kitchen fire. As a reward, the fire chief makes them ""official fighters"". And so, they go into ""business"" for themselves, setting up shop in a barn, and ""creating"" fire engines. While the gags of their makeshift fire dept. are first-rate (the wobbly wheels of one ""vehicle"" is visually hilarious), the story starts off promising, but has nowhere to go once the gang responds to an actual fire. Once there, the danger is just too real to be funny. However, there's a funny gag with Farina struggling with a fire hose which comes ""alive"" & makes him airborne.
CIRCUS FEVER---Sort of wish-fulfillment for any child wanting to play hooky in order to not miss a major event. A montage shows the gang struggling to go to school, but they really want to go to the circus. Mickey gets the idea of falling ill with speckled fever. Naturally, not only does the plan backfire, but the class is rewarded with circus tickets, leaving Mickey, Joe & Jackie confined to bed. Familiar territory, but still entertaining.
THUNDERING FLEAS---The most offbeat short happens to be the most delightful of the bunch here. A professor's ""star attraction"" in his flea circus hops a ride on the gang's pooch. The panicked professor promises to reward the kids if they can find the flea (easier said than done); soon, the rest of the flea troup hitches a ride, infestating a wedding party the gang crashes. The result is predictable but fun to watch: Immediately, the adults begin flinching, scratching, fidgeting & panicking as the critters go to work. Look for cameos from ""preacher"" Jimmy Finlayson (sans mustache), ""cop"" Oliver Hardy, and ""guest"" Charley Chase (who looks as if he inherited Finlayson's mustache!), all legendary performers for Hal Roach studios. The film climaxes with a wildly surreal gag: The pooch's fleas drop onto a bronze statue, which comes to life & begins frantically itching! A real winner, simply because Roach & co. took the concept & milked it for all it was worth.
FIRE FIGHTERS---The unimaginative title to this early Our Gang entry probably says it all. Inadvertently mistaking a moonshine still for a boiler, the gang utilizes it for their own makeshift fire dept. After some gags involving them settling in to their ""quarters"" & looking out for possible fires, the real bootlegger shows up. As with ""The Fourth Alarm"", the concept never really follows through, and the short seems to end abruptly. And how many times can we watch that unfunny gag of inebriated animals stumbling around in slow motion? Must've been a popular gag in the 1920's!
Unfortunately, there's some painful racial humor as black child Gene ""gets sick after that watermelon"" (from the title card), and a caucasian boy is made up as an Asian boy, complete with slanted eyes & buck teeth! Politically incorrect, but alas, just a product of their time. But again, it's the ingenuity of these kids to create makeshift versions of adult inventions, such as fire engines, derby racers, etc., part of the series' charm.
Again, for any collector of Our Gang comedies, this one's a must, too!",1347580800,6,4547,4.875968992248062
