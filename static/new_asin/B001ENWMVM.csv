8299010,1,B001ENWMVM,"""Whoa, Nelly! Despite the claims -- despite the long-winded company name -- there is nothing `restored' about this horrid product from this eBay seller. No excessive use of exclamation marks on packaging or in online descriptions can alter the fact that this shameful disc has been cobbled together from one or two analog video transfers of a 16mm reduction print duplicated on VHS videotape, digitally smoothed to render smeary image details, and digitally reprocessed to attempt to put back what was taken away. One of the video sources is likely the Alpha Video disc, with its logo-stamped intertitles, hence the cleaned-up high-contrast dialog titles here, with artwork titles and letter inserts overlaid with a digitally-added swarm of artificial film grain to mask their origin. The net result looks awful, especially on an HD monitor.
We can see that this edition is the result of a lot of work -- the digitally-generated music accompanying the film is sometimes better than that on the Alpha edition -- but to what end? Much of this effort would not have been necessary had edition producer Bruce Cardozo started with a new video transfer from the best-available print, even if it was from a 16mm reduction print.""

Also, the disc is burned, not pressed. It comes in DVD-R or BD-R.",1357344000,,1289,4.995348837209303
8299011,5,B001ENWMVM,"This was my first ""classic"" title on blu-ray and I was absolutely blown away by the quality. The amount of work that must have gone in to restoring this film, now almost 90 years old, is very impressive to me. It was a real joy to watch a silent film without the usual scratches, pops, and glitches I usually expect to see, gave me a bit of a new perspective on the genre. Many kudos to the people who restored it.

The film itself is also quite fun. A genre would be difficult to pin down as calling it sci-fi does not quite fit, but time travel is always a favorite sci-fi theme of mine and I'm a sucker for anything featuring it. Houdini and all his mystery and strangeness is also in full force here and the whole thing, including the extra escape scene, was quite pleasant to watch.

All in all a very much recommended title and I'm happy with my purchase of it. The history value alone makes it worth it and the chance to see a film this old at this level of quality (I hesitate to call it perfect but it's close) is a very rare treat indeed.",1231545600,,1048,4.157635467980295
8299012,5,B001ENWMVM,"Even though the cover art is the same, make no mistake, this is an ALL NEW restoration for 2008 that improves on the first release, which was pretty darn good to begin with. What I particularly like about this new restoration is the fact that it contains all the original title cards (the first version had to reproduce several). This is, without question, the best, most complete version of The Man From Beyond you can find on DVD. How do I know this? Because, being a Houdini fanatic, I own them ALL and have obsessively compared them side by side.

In addition to the previous Bonus material offered on the DVD, this new version adds the almost complete screenplay of The Master Mystery, scanned from an original with notes on it. This DVD also includes complete and uncut footage of Houdini escaping from a straight jacket in Dayton, Ohio. I've see bits of this footage, but never the whole escape, start to finish, filmed in long shot. What's cool is at one point we can see a cameraman set up on the ledge and shoot the closeup footage that we see most often in documentaries. Great stuff!

Obviously, I recommend this DVD highly.",1221350400,,1136,4.5911330049261085
8299013,5,B001ENWMVM,This is a must for any Houdini fan. Even if you don't know who Houdini was you should get this DVD. Restored Serials has done a fantastic job in restoration. You feel as if you are in the theater watching this. I cannot recommend it enough!,1221004800,,240,4.239130434782608
8299014,5,B001ENWMVM,"This film is a must have for any Houdini fan, or silent film buff.  Restored Serials has done a wonderful job with this movie.  The image quality is great, the music is fantastic, you can easily read the title cards, it contains missing scenes and the extra footage of Houdini escaping from a straight jacket is fabulous!!!

  I have other versions of this film and none of them come close to comparing with what Restored Serials has done here.  It really must be seen to be believed.",1219449600,,484,4.505747126436781
