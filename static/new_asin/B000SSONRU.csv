8206606,5,B000SSONRU,"first off, if you like the Luftwaffe then you need to buy this now, its great and has tons of footage,WW2 is a obsession with me,like a way of life actually,ive seen tons of movies relating to the subject and this collection has plenty ive never seen.

 one gem is some nice footage of Hans rudel and the awesome JU87. there are 8 DVDs comprised of BOMBERS, JETS, SUPPORT AIRCRAFT,FIGHTERS,NIGHT FIGHTERS. some are repeated like the bombers and fighters but specializing in different years.

 the guy that narrates is that English gentleman whose name i cant remember, he has a cool voice, someone in a other review put him down, i like him but it could be a matter of taste. before i forget, there is very good footage of the GIGANT, that's the icing on the cake specially since one was found here recently of the coast of Sardinia.

some of this footage was ""grabbed"" from German newsreels so you sometimes can hear the German narrator in the background, kind of a cool touch. all the DVDs play on my portable, home and computer CD ROM so nothing to worry about, if you live in Timbuktu then make sure and check if its compatible with your system before you buy.

my only gripe? the DVDs come all in individual cases with nice artwork but i wish it would have come with a sleeve to put them in,for the price it would have been a nice touch, i have a bunch of cardboard at work so i might make one myself,like i said it would have been nice but im still plenty happy, its whats inside of the discs that count!!  buy it now if this is your thing,sit down with a buddy and get ready to watch major German airplane action!!",1382054400,2,1621,4.347682119205298
8206607,4,B000SSONRU,"This is a very in depth, accurate, dvd of the Luftwaffe aircraft. I took 1 star off because the narrater speakers very quickly and it is easy to miss something if you are not directly concentrated on it. However, that does not make it any less amazing. This is the best dvd I have come across for the REAL history of the Luftwaffe aircraft in WW2. Anybody who is not sure whether it is worth the money, I assure you it is. You will NOT be dissapointed by this.",1375142400,2,460,4.179775280898877

8206609,5,B000SSONRU,"This is a must have series if you enjoy war birds and the history of World War II.  Not only are the German aircraft and their uses described in excellent detail, but so are the Allied aircraft that they encountered.  There is lots of gun camera footage, plus news reel footage showing the aircraft and the German Aces who flew them.  It doesn't get any better.",1284681600,5,361,4.4393939393939394
8206610,5,B000SSONRU,"...as a WW2 history buff, I could find very little wrong with this review of German aircraft. Aside from the drone of a narrator who could use some voice inflections, this is a great collector series. Well worth the money.",1278288000,6,222,4.575
