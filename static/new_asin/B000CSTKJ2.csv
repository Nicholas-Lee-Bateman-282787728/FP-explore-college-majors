2473010,5,B000CSTKJ2,Our entire family was dancing to this DVD tonight. A wonderful way for toddlers and parents to enjoy music together.,1139961600,7,116,4.85
2473011,5,B000CSTKJ2,We love Laurie!!! I think I enjoy it more than my kids. It gets us all up and dancing! A great way to interact with your kids and have fun!!!,1139961600,5,141,3.7333333333333334
2473012,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My girls, ages 2 & 5 love Laurie, Susie & Brian!  We were so excited when this DVD finally came out!!  You can't help but sing along.  A must have for your DVD kids collection.",1139961600,,176,3.9714285714285715
2473013,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My girls and I are big fans of Laurie Berkner's work on the Noggin network, so of course I went out and got this the first day it came out. The DVD is great! We can't stop singing along! It's got all our favorites from her prior albums (""The Goldfish,"" ""I'm Gonna Catch You,"" ""Bumblebee,"" ""Victor Vito"") plus a great new track called ""Walk Along the River."" But I have to say one of the really special things about this DVD is how my girls can watch Laurie and her band as they play - Laurie's very captivating to a young mind. And I don't mind admitting that I enjoy her, too. The videos are very similiar to the ones played on Noggin, but different enough to be new and interesting. All in all this mom gives this DVD two thumbs up!",1139961600,5,734,4.176056338028169
2473014,5,B000CSTKJ2,"VERY IMPRESSIVE!! I bought this today, on the day of its release, before it even hit the shelves (it was on in a box on the counter) and watched it tonight with my 4 year old twins.  IT IS OUTSTANDING.  Very well shot, the music is well done, and the kids love it. What you see are NOT the same 'videos' that are shown on the Noggin cable channel; these are much better.  There are colorful backdrops, different kids, and the music sounds fuller. The first few tunes will sound familiar and are favorites among Burkner fans.  The new songs are just as lively and enchanting. I've read comments about other CDs from this same band that point out that the sound and mixing is different than what they expected after seeing the band on TV.  You will not find that to be the case this time.

For those uninitiated with the Laurie Berkner Band, they are a fun trio with a perky female lead singer on an acoustic guitar who pack a lot of energy and entertainment into their performances. Backed up by an electric bass and electric keyboard, the three of them perform catchy tunes that are sweet but not syrup-y, and celebrate the wonder (and sometimes the silliness) of childhood.

Parents, this is a great DVD for a winter release, because watching this will get your kids happy and dancing around on cold, dreary days when they are dying for something to do!  Thankfully, the last two songs, ""Moon Moon Moon"" and ""Telephone"" are calming (""Moon"" is a capella and beautifully done"", so while the DVD might get your little one going it will bring them back down for you, too.  (THANK YOU!!)

There is also CD enclosed in this set that, while it doesn't include all the songs that are on the DVD, we can use in the car -- a very nice touch.

The bonus material is fun also, though I found it odd to be hearing ""I Know a Chicken"" (not on the DVD) while watching behind-the-scenes shots from the taping of ""Goldfish"" and ""We are the Dinosaurs.""

As a person with a background in music I really appreciate the musicianship that went into producing this.  A few of the songs are even done a capella (without accompanyment), and the harmonies are tight, well tuned, and very well done.  In fact, I foresee me using this DVD for some covert ear-training excercizes ;) .  Personally, I love having the opportunity to use good harmonization from the songs of one of my daughters' favorite artists as a way to teach them an important life lesson: ""hey, not everyone sings [or does] everything the same way, but things can come together beautifully if people listen to each other and work together.""

BUY IT!  You won't be disappointed.",1139875200,6,2618,4.524416135881104
2473015,4,B000CSTKJ2,"My 4 year old loves Laurie and her band!  The songs are great and the videos are fun to dance along with.  What energy these preformers have.  I would have liked to seen more songs on the DVD it seemed to end really soon, maybe 45 minutes of videos with the bonus 3 songs.  But $10-$12 is a great price for what you get!  If you can only buy Laurie's CD's or this DVD, I would say buy the CD's first, let your kids fall in love with her music and then buy the DVD down the road.

ENJOY!!!!",1139875200,2,489,3.888888888888889
2473016,5,B000CSTKJ2,"I know it's a bit early to write a rewiew when we don't even have the product yet, but I just know that my 2 little girls and I are going to love this DVD!  We love Laurie Berkner!!!  Thank you!!",1139529600,,195,3.731707317073171
2473017,5,B000CSTKJ2,"We are big fans of Laurie Bernker, and based on the song list and the previews we've seen on Lauries twotomatoes site, I think this video is going to become a fast favorite!  One thing to note, though -- for those of you who are expecting the versions you see on Noggin, you are not going to get *exactly* what you want -- but it looks pretty close.  Based on what I've seen in the previews, and info in Laurie's own FAQ, the versions on the DVD are different from the Noggin versions because techincally Noggin owns the versions it shows.  Oh, the joys of copyright!  Personally, I don't care, and I will be snagging this for my girls as soon as it comes out.

** Edited to add:  My girls really enjoy this DVD -- they run and get ""mikes"" to sing along to Oh Susannah, they play their ""bass guitar"" with Brian, and Walk Along the River has become a huge hit in our house.  The bonus features are requested regularly, as well -- particularly the behind-the-scenes segment set to I Know a Chicken.  Great job, Brian, Laurie, and Susie!",1139356800,,1034,4.348958333333333
2473018,5,B000CSTKJ2,"I received this information in an email from Laurie Berkner's email list.  Just wanted to share with others who are excited about this DVD's release.  We love the Laurie Berkner Band and the Noggin Videos!

2473027,5,B000CSTKJ2,"We've had this particular music video movie for about 4 years, now.  We ordered it for our oldest son, who fell immediately in love, and learned every dance to every song.  This allowed him to be active when stuck inside for most of the winter, and frankly, the kid was absolutely adorable doing all the little moves to each song.  Our oldest son has since outgrown his love for this (thank God!), but we have brought it back to life for our twin toddlers (what were we thinking?), who are equally in love with the songs and dances.  If you're not driven crazy by listening to kid's songs on repeat, and don't mind the explosion you might encounter from your toddler(s) when you've had it and finally turn this off for the day, this DVD is the one for you (well, for your toddler)!  In all seriousness, it's a great DVD of some pretty cute and very interactive songs to wear the kids out.",1453852800,,888,4.390243902439025
2473028,5,B000CSTKJ2,We love Laurie Berkner. My son watches this every weekend. Any kid under six enjoy this and love singing and playing along. I'm an adult and love the songs. We donated a copy to my son's school.,1451520000,,194,4.27027027027027

2473033,5,B000CSTKJ2,I don't care what Laurie Berber is doing as long as she keeps the baby in dance mode. He thinks she's spectacular and for that reason she's also high on my list. The songs are cute. It is what it is. I've already watched it today so I'll be seeing her tomorrow at breakfast. Could be wayyyyyyyyyyy worse.,1445904000,,304,4.258620689655173
2473034,5,B000CSTKJ2,kids are enjoying this a lot!,1445558400,,29,4.0
2473035,5,B000CSTKJ2,"I'm a nanny and the last family I worked for owned this DVD. Somehow it became a magical tool that stopped the baby from crying. He loved it so much, that even when we were in public I could sing the songs and he'd immediately stop fussing. The three year old loved it as well and we all spent many hours singing and dancing and running around the house/stomping around like dinosaurs to this DVD. When I moved on to my current baby, I found myself singing the songs to him as well. I bought him his own copy for his first birthday and he enjoys it. He's not walking or dancing yet but I'm sure he will be soon. Mom likes it because he doesn't stare at it like he does with normal tv, he plays along to it. Mom and dad are kind of too cool for school, and make fun of a lot of dorky kid stuff, but they seem to tolerate this. I, on the other hand, write my own silly songs and sing nonstop so it's a great activity for me. Laurie writes very cute and creative songs but the songs on this DVD are her best in my opinion. You can be active along with the videos and kids will learn to appreciate instruments and music with this DVD. I recommend having shakers and drums available for playing along with it. Enjoy!",1443916800,,1211,4.092436974789916

2473078,5,B000CSTKJ2,"I work in the playroom at a children's hospital, and I have never come across a more universally loved children's music DVD than this one. This DVD seems to be most popular with children from about 2-6 years old, but even older and younger kids start singing along when this gem comes on. These songs are perfect for incorporating movement and exercise into your child's day, or even just as background music while playing with instruments, other toys etc. Some of the most persnickety kids I've worked with have fallen for these fun and lively songs. As an added bonus, these songs are pretty catchy and do not have a lot of the annoying factor that many other children's music products do. I have listened to this music hundreds of times, and it still doesn't bother me at all.

We found this DVD and could not have been happier!  The music is some of Laurie's best & the switch from playful videos on JBMS to the band ""just jamming"" around the sets kept everything fresh for her & us.  The ""Moon Moon Moon"" lullabye was a new one for us & has become a favorite since it turned out to be the only thing that helped her fall asleep while getting another tooth in a strange hotel.  Thanks Laurie, Bryan & Suzie!  We ""wove you wots!""

2473241,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My 2 two year olds love this video.  It outranks any Disney, Blues Clues, or Elmo video that I offer.  We don't watch videos often. They used to always ask for Pooh, Nemo or Blue, but now that they have the ""We are...The Laurie Berkner Band"" video all they want to watch is their ""songs"".  When they are by themselves they will sometimes stand and march along with the Dinosaurs.  When I am watching it with them, we all get up and dance along with the videos and race around the room giggling as we catch each other.

The best part about Laurie Berkner songs is that I don't mind hearing them over and over again.  They are almost as enjoyable for the adults as for the children.  The most adorable part is when my DD's are supposed to be going to sleep, sometimes I hear them singing ""We are the dinosaurs, marching, marching...""",1194825600,,831,4.357142857142857

Plus, it is typically not a video we just sit and watch.  On rainy or cold days we are pretending we are the bees with ""Buzz Buzz"" or the dinosaurs stomping around with ""We Are the Dinosaurs"".  We swim like the fishes and you better run when ""I'm Gonna Catch You"" comes on.  A lot of times the TV is not even on and the girls are pretending while singing the songs.

This DVD shows the band playing in front of a cheap, tossed together prop set. Some songs are a bit more visually pleasing with a few kids tossed in or some costumes.

*I am updating this review after having the DVD for a couple of months. Apparently my son's initial dislike of the CD has worn off. At age 2.5 he is completely captivated by the DVD. He knows all the words to ""Moon, Moon, Moon"" & asks for me to sing it to him each night before bed.
I would update my review to 5 stars, but I am unable to change it.
Moral is....if  you child doesn't initially like it, try again a month later. My son now loves this DVD",1180137600,30,791,4.096774193548387

We first came to know Laurie Berkner from Noggin and ""Jack's Big Music Show,"" and I have to say that right along side of Dan Zanes and Friends, she's tops in children's music!  Her music is not condescending and it's not annoying (sorry, Barney!), and the words are easy for little ones to learn!

Our daughter loves to dance and interact with the videos.  I also like the way that the videos are separated, so you don't have to watch the entire run if you don't want to.

Whenever Laurie and her band come out with a new video, we will definitely buy it!  Kudos to Laurie, Susie and Brian!  (or Adam now...)

It's also awesome for the car in case you're running errands with a grumpy toddler...  and the bonus CD is great!",1179705600,,819,4.266233766233766
2473260,5,B000CSTKJ2,"One for the kids this time, as we present to you, ""We Are...The Laurie Berkner Band""...

  Now, I have seen many a singer and/or songwriter try to make a video for children, only to look like they are `making a video for children'...(One rare `vinyl' exception to this rule, is the terrific actress/singer Jessica Harper, who turned her beautiful vocal stylings towards recording a lot of wonderful albums for kids...)

  But, with the Laurie Berkner Band (which consists of Laurie, as well as Brian Mueller and Susie Lampert), they provide fun visual entertainment, as well as songs that, I don't care what age you are, you won't be able to get them outta your head...

  ""I'm Gonna Catch You"", ""Walk Along The River"" and ""Buzz, Buzz"" are just some of the titles that will delight children and adults, and, most of all, the band itself looks like they are having the most fun of all, and I think that's what makes this a very special project indeed...",1179100800,,952,4.652694610778443

As any parent of a toddler can attest, anything that keeps their child's interest for more than 15 straight minutes is worth its weight in gold.  The songs are lighthearted; the words simple; it is easy to learn to sing along with the songs; and there are many things in the background that your child can notice and point to.  Every time I go for a walk with my daughter she inevitably starts stomping her feet to sing ""we are the dinosaurs, marching marching;"" she also belts out ""Oh Susannah"" at random times throughout the day.

It comes with a bonus CD with 4 songs from the DVD and 1 song Berkner did with Tom Chapin.

""The Goldfish"" is one of our favorites...""What a minute....""-my two year old loves that line, and he loves to ""march"" to ""We are the Dinosaurs"", and he runs around the kitchen chanting the refrain to ""I'm Gonna Catch You""...my 5 year old can recite almost every song word for word.

We were introduced to The Laurie Berkner Band on Noggin's Jack's Big Music Show and have not been disappointed by the DVD which my son watches at least once a day. Between Jack and Laurie, we now have a little boy who LOVES music, practices the moves he sees on TV, names and plays multiple instruments, sings the songs and worships the musicians he studies so intently. I swore before I became a parent that I wouldn't let my child watch too much T.V. He watches more than I thought he would, but I feel better about the fact that he's involved, on his feet, ""moving to the music"" and not just zoned out while being entertained. We eagerly await another Laurie DVD and are grateful that this music is much more than tolerable to parents, but rather good, fun and catchy.

It's taken over a year, but I'm so glad she came out with one - he (and now his little brother) love bopping around to Laurie's songs.  Their fresh, inventive, catchy, and funny - even to adults! - and they're not annoying, like some kids' music is.  This DVD is great, because it has songs that my son was familiar with from seeing her on TV, clips of kids dancing around, and it's just the right length.  It includes a couple ""behind the scenes"" videos, which cracked my son up.

Only downside is that it is brief. It seems like the video is over not long after it's begun. But that's because you and your child are having so much fun singing and dancing!",1167782400,,446,4.126436781609195

Even though her songs are upbeat and silly sometimes- she has a sense of calmness about her as well.  Great songs, great band!!",1167782400,,250,4.613636363636363

We bought this video when she was 19 months and she took to it immediately.  She loved to dance around and imitate Laurie's routines.  We played it once when a friend was visiting and the other little girl adored the video too.  I think it is a bit short for the price though.",1167782400,,393,4.3561643835616435

Within a couple of days he was singing ""Ooh Wa"" with Walk Along the River and running with I'm Gonna Catch You.  This video really helped his personality shine. He's 18 months old now, and just got a toy piano and guitar for Christmas because he tries to imitate the band with our real instruments.  We've had the best time pretending to be the band and doing the motions together as a family.  A little ""Laurie Time"" will brighten up the day for all of us!",1167696000,,616,4.186440677966102

She loves Laurie though, she's been on a Laurie kick for about 6-8 months now.  She loves it!  At any point in the day she'll just start singing  Moon Moon Moon.... it's adorable.",1165795200,,332,3.823529411764706
2473313,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My kid likes to watch movies a lot. I've seen almost all of the Baby Einstein movies, tons of Elmo's world... you name it and we've seen it too much. Most of these movies teach and entertain our children, but few keep us adults in the mix. However, when this DVD goes in I actually find myself singing along and enjoying it more then I ever expected. Laurie's voice is phenomenal, and the songs are all very catchy with light hearted themes. The harmonies show that this could be an everyday rock/pop band if they were to go that path. My daughter sings the songs and dances (which keeps her active instead of just sitting around like a lump in front of the TV). She loves this DVD from beginning to end, and she isn't alone. The only bad part about these songs is that they are so catchy I have them in my head when I am trying to get stuff done at work! ""Under a shady tree, you and me..."" hahaha

I couldn't recommend this more to a parent with young children.",1163980800,2,963,4.233695652173913

His older brothers (6 and 8) dance and sing with him to the entire DVD which is a rare achievement.  My hubby and I have privately and jokingly cursed the catchiness of these tunes but are thrilled to have at least one disc our toddler will watch all the way through.

The lyrics are really cute and the beats are great.  Simple music but very creative.  I signed up for updates on Laurie Berkner's website so I can find out when/if she ever comes to town so my daughter (and I, of course) can go see her.  She is a great alternative to Barney and all of the other commercial characters, who I don't care much for.

It worked like a charm!  He immediately stops crying the moment I turn on the CD, SO I had to go out and purchase the DVD as well.  As suspected - the DVD entertains him at home and in the car.  He loves to dance, squeal and laugh while watching it.  My [...] loves it too.  She has memorized all of the songs and dances with the music, which makes my [...] laugh even more.

He dances along to all the songs and sings along as he's able.  We end up watching it up to 3 times a day, and it doubles as a toddler workout video as he's moving for the full half hour straight!!  Works out as a good mommy workout video too as I'll dance along with him which he loves even more.  I just can't praise it enough.  He just gets so excited and it's just so adorable.",1161302400,,541,3.9444444444444446

I don't think I need to add much else to what has already been said about this wonderful DVD, but I would like to note that our twins absolutely love the three bonus tracks, which we refer to as ""Chicken,"" ""Mess,"" and ""Moon.""

In fact, our son sings the line ""I know a chicken"" in a gravelly blues voice that would impress Robert Johnson. Too funny for words.",1159920000,,549,4.372549019607843
2473333,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My sister gave me Laurie's CDs while I was pregnant. As a first-time mom-to-be, I was hesitant to overexpose my unborn child (and then newborn) to ""annoying kiddie music"". However, Laurie's simple but upbeat arrangements are anything but annoying, and my son, at just a few months, would smile and get excited when ""Victor Vito"" came on the stereo. Flash forward to his 6 month birthday and my sister gave us the DVD. He was just mesmerized by the vibrant colors, familiar and fun music and smiling faces of both the band and the children they have singing and dancing to the music. He just loves Victor Vito, We Are The Dinosours and even the slightly off-key and off-beat Oh Susannah. When he's at his fussiest and not even mom can entertain him, I put him in his exersaucer and put on Laurie and he is so happy, he'll clap and ""dance"" along with the music. I can't say enough great things about Laurie's music - she is definitely in tune with the 0-4 age group! Thank you Laurie!",1159142400,2,982,4.4916201117318435
2473334,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My daughter received this video for her second birthday from Grandma.  We don't watch much regular TV at our house so I had never heard of Laurie Berkner, but now we are big fans.

My daughter LOVES to dance, so this video is perfect for her.  Some of our favorites are ""Victor Vito"" and ""The Goldfish"", but all of the songs on the video are easy to learn and sing with.  After 3 months my two year old was singing many words along with the songs and also singing them when the video wasn't even on.  She loved the songs so much that I ended up buying the ""Victor Vito"" album to take in the car since the bonus album that comes with this DVD is kind of short and doesn't have our aforementioned favorites on it.  And unlike many of the kids albums we own I can even listen to this one many, many times before I get tired of it.

Also, I know that this DVD has (relatively) long age appeal as my 5 year old niece requested this video for her birthday as well.

Thank goodness for Grandmas and mother-in-laws who know their kids' music!  Our household is much more fun because of it!",1159056000,,1081,4.183574879227053

2473338,5,B000CSTKJ2,"I ordered this DVD for my four-year-old autistic daughter, who loves Laurie Brekner's videos on Noggin, especially ""We Are the Dinosaurs.""

The videos are simple, yet colorful and fun. The band and the guest children are dressed in eye-catching colors, and the backgrounds for some of the songs are very cute. My daughter especially enjoys ""The Goldfish"" song. The silliness and fun dance-motions get her up and bopping around and pretending to swim.

I just wish the DVD ran longer than it does, but for what it is, it is definitely worth the price. Added bonus features such as a behind the scenes peek set to music and an accapella video provide some extra fun.

As an added thought... Adults wishing for more exercise while staying with children should dig in to this video. It's not an exercise set per se, but dancing with your child will get the blood pumping and laughter rolling!

The were routinely singing lyrics to songs I didn't know and I found out the lyrics were from this DVD, which the daycare provider had.  The DVD was delivered approximately one month ago and we have watched it at least once daily since its arrival.  My girls can't get enough of this music video.  And a plus is that my husband and I don't cringe when it comes on like with do with other kids music and shows.  The folky style of LBB is attractive to the ear and the lyrics are a lot of fun and easy to learn.  My 1 1/2 year old can sing ""Buzz, Buzz"" and ""Moon, Moon, Moon"" already!  My 3 1/2 year old knows almost all the lyrics.  And the best fun of all is the rousing 1st track....""I'm Gonna Catch You"" (which reviews the days of the week with a cute rhyme and a super-catchy melody)...cuz my girls and I get exercise as we run around the room ""catching"" one another.

I'm so thankful there is classy, fun children's music out there.  I had no idea kids music could be this good.  This DVD is a staple in our house now.

2473380,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My son watches Noggin quite a bit, and we were thus introduced to the music of the Laurie Berkner Band through their ""music videos"" on that network. The songs are cute and catchy and generally not as annoying as most children's music, but lately our favorite song videos--for songs like ""Pig On Her Head"" or ""Victor Vito""--have been airing less and less frequently. So I was really excited to see this collection advertised on TV. It not only has our favorites (other songs include ""Buzz Buzz Buzz,"" ""We Are the Dinosaurs,"" and ""Under A Shady Tree"") but a few songs we didn't know yet and a bonus audio CD to take along in the car. One song, ""I'm Gonna Get You"" goes over the days of the week, and I think it will be a fun way to teach the days to my son, so I'm looking forward to getting to know it better.

The settings for the videos are simple and colorful, the band's scenes are mixed with kids singing along, just as on the Noggin videos, and the band members themselves are fun, seem friendly, and wear really colorful clothes that are sure to catch kids' attention. It should be noted that the videos on this DVD are NOT the same as those on Noggin; they've been redone with slightly more elaborate sets and with a different group of children.

The quality of the songs, videos, and performances are all top-notch. My only real complaint is that one song is sung by the backup singer Brian, who is apparently much better at harmonizing than at singing a melody. His ""Oh Susannah"" is off-key and not nearly as enjoyable as the other videos.

The DVD has 10 songs as well as bonus behind-the-scenes videos. As mentioned it comes with a bonus audio CD as well. Overall, I think this is a great buy for anyone familiar with Laurie Berkner's music or with the videos on Noggin, and I also think it's a great buy for any parents looking for some fun music to sing and dance along to with their children. Considering the number of CDs Laurie Berkner has out there, there could perhaps have been more songs on this collection, but it's on par with most children's music videos and indeed some adult music video collections, so I don't think this is a detriment to the item.",1148515200,68,2174,4.443609022556391

Now at 22 mos she likes to sing, clap and dance along and will even specifically ask for Laurie and has some of her favorite songs the she will ask for, like Shady Tree (Under a Shady Tree) and Chicken Egg (I Know a Chicken).

These videos are terrific -- done in a similar style to those featured on Noggin, only I think these are better. Laurie is a terrific talent who's music is comtemporary and relevant for kids. The tunes are high energy and catchy and won't drive parents crazy! Heck, I'll admit it, we find ourselves singin along!

We just have one request -- Laurie has so many songs we love, we need another collection of videos on DVD!

My one year old nephew loves her and so does a set of two year old triplets that we know! Laurie's tunes are catchy fun and easy to learn. Of course my husband and I are singing them all the time as are our parents! Laurie, you guys made a great DVD.

My daughter would come running everytime from different rooms to see the cartoon cow on Susie's head.  Heck--so would I.

So for my daughter's 4th birthday she received this awesome DVD from her grandparents. I have been so very happy with the product. I especially love ""Pig on her Head"",
""Telephone"", ""Walk Along the River"", ""I Know a Chicken"", and the lollybye (as misprounced by my daughter) ""Moon, Moon, Moon"".

Along with Laurie is Brian Mueller and Susie Lampert.  They are excellent entertainers.  They are all so vital dancing around and are uninhibited and seem so spontaneous.  And I love how they use children in this DVD to sing and dance with them.

I wish I could be a mom who could whip out a guitar and sing sweet songs to my child.  At least Laurie's voice which is homey and warm is in a range where I can sound pretty good myself.  The harmony between the threesome is beautiful.",1146441600,7,1070,4.463917525773196

2473398,5,B000CSTKJ2,"I'm not allowed to watch this DVD or listen to the CD. This package belongs to our daughter. It lives in her room. My job was to buy it. And turn it on. And then get out.

Very odd. The kid is otherwise known for her generosity. What is it about Laurie Berkner?

Last night, under cover of darkness, I slipped into her room and pilfered 'We are...The Laurie Berkner Band.' Popped on my headphones (I wanted to make sure the sound didn't wake her) and pressed PLAY.  And promptly fell under Laurie Berkner's spell.

It's a curious thing, this celebrity/stardom thing. On the West Side of Manhattan, I see women like Laurie Berkner --- or maybe Laurie herself --- all the time. Early 30s. Frizzy hair. Married, often with a kid in tow to prove it. Not stylishly dressed, not conventionally pretty, but not generic either --- she's invariably alert, interested, very much alive in the present moment.  Has lots of female friends on her speed-dial. Not a shirker --- I imagine her working in a Montessori school, with a flock of kids hanging on her. And this, above all: She never loses her temper. It's not that she's satisfied with her life --- her husband is a junior something-or-other, making money's not his greatest gift --- but what matters most to her is that she's living in New York, among smart people who, like her, are looking up, up, always up.

That's my take, anyway. It turns out to be fairly accurate: Laurie Berkner hails from New Jersey, played in all kinds of bands, moved to New York, taught music to kids, discovered she had a gift for writing songs for kids, started her own company in her living room. National magazines began praising her CDs,

Entertainment Weekly pronounced her the ""in"" children's performer, ""Sex & The City"" featured one of her songs, NOGGIN TV channel picked up her videos. ""Good Morning America"" came next: ""If you think the Beatles made a splash in '63, wail 'till you see the mayhem caused by this woman."" The ""Today"" Show did its part. Laurie had a baby and stopped touring. As her web site reminds you several times, she does not do birthday parties.

Charming. Impressive. And irrelevant. What you really need to know is what  kids think. And what they think is this: I LOVE YOU, LAURIE. Because, to a 4-year-old girl, she is a goddess, second only to Mom.

This should be very pleasing news to parents of young girls. The Wiggles are great, but they're guys. Elmo is sort of male. Barney, despite his tragic cellulite problem, is male. And so on. For female role models, there's Dora. But Dora isn't real. And Dora doesn't sing.

Laurie Bleckner, in her pastel clothes, can sing. She can play a mean acoustic guitar. And she can write songs for kids that have great hooks; she's many levels better than the competition. The music is Beatles-derivative, which is entirely the right idea --- Susie Lampert, on keyboards, and Brian Mueller, her husband, on bass, are really all the instrumentation her songs need. And she is witty, in a kid-friendly way:

We are the dinosaurs

marching, marching

We are the dinosaurs

Whadya think of THAT?

What I think --- what I have, briefly, witnessed before being ejected from the room --- is that kids get up during that song and march around. And that lyrics like this lead to very amusing videos. Consider what Laurie and her band can do with a bunch of kids and lyrics like these:

I'm gonna catch you

You'd better run

I'm gonna catch you

Here I come

Right. Happy chaos. And passionate identification. Or so I gather. Some day I may be admitted to the sanctum, there to be initiated into the Laurie Berkner fan club. For now, Laurie is the kid's secret. As they go, I can't think of a better, safer one.

If you have a 3-to-5 year-old child and don't own 'We are....The Laurie Berkner Band,' I have only one question for you: What are you waiting for?",1145232000,13,3849,4.580174927113703

The gang is back, singing old favorites and some new instant hits.  You probably know the Noggin songs - We are the Dinosaurs, Victor Vito, Bumblebee, Pig on Her Head; new to us (although several are on Jack's Big Music Show) were ""I'm Gonna Catch You,"" which is a catchy tune featuring the days of the week; ""Walk Along the River"" which has a fun beat and folksy-feel (ooh-wa, ooh-wa, wah-oooooo); ""Under a Shady Tree"" has a Jimmy Buffet-ish tropical beat; ""The Goldfish,"" a fun song with a great refrain (""Wait a Minute, We're Fish!""); and ""Moon, Moon, Moon,"" a lovely lullaby sung acapella by Laurie, Brian and Suzie.  Nice harmonies!

When the credits roll, it's more music!  There are special features, such as making of the ""I know a Chicken"" (yes, complete with that popular song!).  The whole disc is fun, good music!  These guys just keep putting out terrific songs that kids and adults will love.  The only way to improve on it would be to make it longer (or play itself over and over).

2473430,5,B000CSTKJ2,"Our whole family loves this video!  Yes, I mean Mom and Dad love it along with the 2 and 4 yr old.  Laurie's music is upbeat, happy, and fun to sing.  We know most of the songs now and dance around and sing while we watch the video.  If your kids like music (that isn't annoying), a little guitar, and fun fresh songs...you should get this!  The free music CD is a great Bonus for the car.",1142899200,3,389,4.0
2473431,5,B000CSTKJ2,"My 2 year old daughter has loved the Laurie Berekner Band since she saw them on noggin, and she LOVES this DVD! The songs are short and fun for the kids to dance to, I highly recommend it!",1142899200,3,188,3.973684210526316
2473432,5,B000CSTKJ2,"If a child is sitting in front of a television, We Are the Laurie Berkner Band is the award-winning entertainment they should be watching. The Laurie Berkner Band is an upbeat group with an extraordinary talent for writing and performing. The band's energy is contagious, so ""just sitting"" is not what they inspire!

Songs on the DVD are collected from Berkner's many cds, and fans of Berkner's music will love seeing the band in action. Add children, bright clothes and DVD technology, and you have a very enjoyable, entertaining video.

The children on the DVD are amazing. They come in all shapes and sizes; a welcomed respite from the standard Abercrombie & Fitch kid crowd. In the bonus tracks, the behind-the-scenes video shows fans how the DVD was made, including all the children's involvement. There are some great out-takes, including a girl correcting the adult cuing her.

The DVD starts out with I'm Gonna Catch You, an upbeat song featuring the seven days of the week and fun, random rhymes about each day. Their song Victor Vito is delightful. Vegetarian parents will love its emphasis on eating healthy food. Their version of O Susannah is fabulous, especially since it gives Berkner's husband, the bassist, a chance at the microphone. He pulls it off well.

The band members seem comfortable performing for kids, though they started out their careers playing adult-centered music. There's not a lot of self-conscious performing; they look healthy and interested, unlike some ""for-kid groups"" who look like your scary next-door-neighbor or as if they might have had a past life in a circus! Laurie Berkner is fun, but she's not a clown.

The clothing the band wears might put off some conservative parents - or parents who don't get out much. Laurie and the pianist, Susie Lampert, wear fun, bright clothes that sometimes are figure-hugging and lingerie-like. Although Berkner dances around and has some wonderful moves while playing the guitar, she usually sports solid high heels. Because Laurie is lovely, and our children might want to be ""just like"" her, those may not be the kind of shoes parents want their daughters asking for. But hopefully they'll skip wanting her shoes and will just want her amazing voice, great smile, great dancing and bouncing hair.

From the goofy (but somehow sophisticated) dance moves to the learn-the-signs songs, Berkner and her band are fun and encourage interactivity. The DVD includes two songs that were recorded live, which adds a familiarity adults will enjoy.

The DVD debuted on the Billboard Music Video DVD Chart at #1, and has kept that position for 4 weeks in a row---not surprising!-Caity McCardell",1142812800,6,2665,5.043181818181818

2473444,4,B000CSTKJ2,"My 1 year old son likes the first couple of songs on the DVD.  That's as much as he likes of any of them.  I like the songs very much.  I go around singing them the rest of the day.

We watch Laurie Berkner quite a bit on Noggin.  I have to say I like her videos on Noggin a little better than the ones on her DVD.",1142812800,,314,3.5588235294117645

For any kid who loves music this is the perfect gift because it has been the only thing that keeps my daughter attention span! I HIGHLY recommend the DVD, because it is upbeat and the music is catchy. There isn't a day that does go by where my daughter is running up to the DVD player and pressing buttons wanting to turn on the video.

Now, we have this new one and he can't get enough of it!  I turn it on and he smiles-he laughs when everyone ""roars"" during We Are The Dinosaurs, he loves Oh Susannah-I think because Brian is dancing.  I can't say enough good things about this DVD.

Whenever a Berkner video would come on my daughter would stop whatever she was doing and just watch with amazement.  When I saw this DVD, I had to get it to add to her collection.  My daughter is now 9 months old and she absolutely loves Laurie.  We watch this over and over and she claps her hands and gets so excited to see these videos.  These songs are so catchy, I find myself singing them all the time even when I am at work and there are no children in sight.  They are all very happy, dance along songs.  Highly recommended!

I have been waiting for her to come out with this dvd for quite some time. As soon as I put this dvd in for my sons they were SO excited! As previous posters have said, her music is great for the whole family. I've never been annoyed with any of her songs, and find myself singing them through out the day. Repeat play option would be nice, but this DVD is worth EVERY penny spent! I hope she comes out with another dvd soon. Laurie truly has a gift for entertaining children!

I'm so glad that I can finally turn off the cable and just play music videos or the CD of their favorite band. Laurie is truly amazing! She doesnt sing the annoying, I'm going to kill myself if I have to hear that one more time... type of music. I catch my husband singing Victor Vito all the time, and I love Shady Tree, so it's truly and enjoyable experience for kids AND the adults. Her music is truly great for the whole family. I hope she comes out with more, not only for my kids, but so we have more music to dance and sing to for our whole family dance parties. Yippee!",1141948800,,699,4.147058823529412

There are a few minor phrase variations in the songs between the DVD and the CD (we play the CD in the car and have to remember to sing the phrases that are a bit different), but they in no way take away from the fun you will have incorporating these songs into your child's song repertoire.  I find myself singing these songs in at my desk in my office, to my staff's chagrin.  Hooray for the Laurie Berkner band!!!!",1141603200,3,604,4.050420168067227

This video is so engaging that my five month old Jace even stops to listen and watch while his big brother dances and sings.

The included CD is also great! it is short but great for the car! (or anywhere)

All of her favorites are on the DVD including We are the Dinosaurs, Victor Vito, and Pig on her Head.  My son just loves marching to We are the Dinosaurs.
