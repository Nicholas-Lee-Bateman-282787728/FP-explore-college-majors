8477001,4,B005KN1LYQ,"The series is great,but whoever developed the English subtitles didn't do a spot on job. There are a few misspelled words, a few times where the subs go too fast and sometimes a sentence doesn't make sense. All and all it's still really good with VERY few errors.",1350086400,,263,4.5
8477002,2,B005KN1LYQ,"before I get started with this review let me just say that I love this anime. It is one of my all time favorites and I've already seen it twice. this being said, if you plan on relying on the subtitles, do NOT buy this dvd. When I recieved this in the mail I was really excited and immediately put it into the my computer to watch it, only to find out the subtitles are so bad i cannot make heads or tails of the conversation. It is literally impossible to understand what they are talking about from watching these subtitles. It might work better to try and get it somewhere else. If you understand and can speak japanese then this doesn't really apply to you. I just wanted to warn those who enjoy watching anime by reading the subtitles.",1336953600,,740,4.292857142857143
8477003,5,B005KN1LYQ,"Greetings;

Tenchi Muyo more accurately, Photon and to a lesser extent, Spaceship Agga Ruter and Masquarade. All very awesome series. Just to give a little bit of a heads up though, from experience-the series, Isekai, I mean-can be a bit buggy. I have searched all over online and found one DVD format set, all 13 episodes on one disk. The first episode is an hour long I believe and all the others are some 45 minutes, which kinda adds up. Honestly though, that isn't always such a problem, but I had to buy this same set twice because the first I bought froze up during one episode so I lost the last ten minutes and the first minute and a half of the next. Furthermore though, I don't know that I would pay the asking price that I see for the listing on here. $65 something? I mean, the show is totally worth it and all, but I would just assume pay $19.99 and get it brand new. Or wait, I imagine eventually the series will get picked up, broken down into more episodes(13 becomes 24-26 maybe(?)) and dubbed into English, much as the rest of the other tenchi series had been. Usually, the same sites that you can find this copy of Isekai for $19.99 you can also find Photon and the rest of the Tenchi sets for reasonable prices(look Photon: the idiot adventures up on here and you will see its a bit north of $20). So indeed, I would recommend picking them all up to better get to know the shows. I frankly, cannot wait to see how they dub Isekai into english and release it in America. Someday...Sigh.

Thank you and take care...",1331856000,2,1533,4.337979094076655
