2057318,1,B00023BLSK,"Pro: Shannon Rossiter is in the movie and very cute (sorry to say you do not get to see much of her)

Con: This movie is like a never ending train wreck. You start off excited to see a lesbian movie, which quickly turns to ""I hope this gets better"", closely followed with ""well at least its almost over"" But its not. Its the movie that will never end. They keep setting it up to end then it continues. When you finally finish the movie you just sit there stunned watching the credits fly by...not because it was some great twist ending, or even a great ending in general...but because you can not believe you just wasted 105 minutes of your life that you will never get back. You could have felt more productive watching your dog chase his own tail for that whole time...it would have been more entertaining.",1201132800,2,808,4.386666666666667
2057319,1,B00023BLSK,"After you get through the awful sound quality and stereotypical characters you reach the most preposterous, horrific ending ever seen. Wow. Truly, absolutely, actually terrible.",1184803200,2,177,6.12
2057320,1,B00023BLSK,"..every movie has one - or TRIES to have one.  BUT, WHAT EV-ER to the 4 stars and anyone who even wastes our time by including what this film THOUGHT it was trying to say in their review.  It absolutely STINKS in every way!",1181952000,2,223,4.045454545454546
2057321,1,B00023BLSK,"This might be the worst movie I have ever seen... maybe with the exception of ""girls can't swim"" or ""inescapable"".  The acting was bad, the directing was bad, the sound was bad and the plot even worse.  If you want to see a good lesbian movie, try ""Fingersmith"", ""Show me love"" or ""Saving Face"" instead.",1157846400,4,303,4.490909090909091
2057322,1,B00023BLSK,"It was a Saturday night when my friends and I popped in this DVD with no idea what to expect. By the end of the evening, my stomach hurt so badly from laughing that I have to say that I had a downright good time.  There are many problems with this film, number one being that it takes itself so seriously, and with such amateur filming, acting, directing, etc., one cannot afford to believe this will light the film world on fire.  We had more fun making fun of this film - its script, non-believable characters, and, of course, the acting, that I would consider seeing it again.  My favorite part of the film, however, is when the director/writer/producer thanked each of her fifteen dogs by name in the credits.  Too much! Don't buy it, rent it, and have yourself an MST 3000 film night!",1124668800,8,789,4.4206896551724135
2057323,1,B00023BLSK,"I have never written a movie review for Amazon before, but am compelled now as I wouldn't want anyone to spend their hard earned money on this film.  The only thing keeping this movie from being the lesbian ""Heaven's Gate"" is the budget.",1112745600,13,237,4.511627906976744
2057324,1,B00023BLSK,"This movie was made on the cheap and you can tell. A lesbian (who works in an auto parts store - so cliche) falls for a straight woman who is married and has a kid. (Cliche)  They meet at a softball game (BIG TIME CLICHE) and end up having an affair.  Lesbian tells hubby she's in love with his wife.  Man tells wife and lesbian he's willing to share (!!!!)  Lesbian can't take it and leaves the state.  Straight girl calls lesbian up and begs her to come back home even though she has no intention of leaving her husband.  I won't tell you the ending but of course it has an unhappy ending (it has to have an unhappy ending because it has a lesbian in it.) TO SUM IT UP, THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!!!  The straight women only seemed interested in having sex with the lesbian (variety is the spice of life), while the lesbian is interested in having a relationship.  (Another dang cliche) I also didn't understand why the straight guy would ever tolerate sharing his wife (who'd I'd dump in a heartbeat) with someone else. I also have NO IDEA why anyone would want to make a film like this because it has such an unhappy ending. As I said at the beginning of this review,this movie was filmed on the cheap and the story and sound track were terrible. I would give this film a ZERO if I could.  This is just another horrible and depressing lesbian flick with an unhappy ending among many .... <<SNIFF>>

If your a lesbian in a movie or tv show, you aren't allowed to live happily ever after ...

For a happily ever after lesbian movie, check out, When Night is Falling.",1108425600,36,1564,4.303754266211604
2057325,1,B00023BLSK,"I guess anyone with a camera and a crappy script can release a DVD. The director should be put to sleep for for making this movie two hours too long. The sound is so horrible, the backround music is so loud most of the time you can't even understand what the actors say.",1094774400,13,270,4.113207547169812
2057326,4,B00023BLSK,"I am a self-admitted movie snob, so I was completely prepared to disregard this film. The production values are shoddy - it's shot on video, the sound quality is bad, the script is pretty poor, lots of production errors BUT... The acting of the three main characters is so absolutely genuine it overcomes those obstacles to draw you into the story. I bawled my eyes out! Even the huge stretch the character of the husband has to make comes across as very believable and loving. I thought the love scenes between the two women were very tender. A bit more passion would have been nice, but still very lovely.",1093478400,14,607,4.577981651376147
2057327,2,B00023BLSK,"I've seen a lot of lesbian romance movies.  Some are cute, some are steamy, some are full of angst and unrequited love.

This one is none of those things.  As it strives to convey a sense of reality, a sense that not all decisions are easy, and that some can love more than one person, it loses focus.

From poor sound quality (had the TV all the way up and still missed out) and the dark scenes (left me guessing at what we were viewing in some cases) to the predictable but tragic ending, this is not something that I'd recommend.

Spend your money on Bound or Chutney Popcorn.",1092528000,12,579,4.275229357798165

The emotions seemed real. I wish the ending could have been different.  One of the first lesbian films I ever saw and since have watched many, many more.

8021105,5,B00023BLSK,"I'm an inveterate movie watcher AND list maker.
In the past few years, my movie watching has become almost fixated on lesbian-themed movies.
So much so that, just a few days ago, I made a list of my ""Top 30 Lesbian Movies"" I'd seen.
""Maggie & Annie was NOWHERE in the Top 30!!
(I'd considered it, but having seen it only once, about a year ago, I remembered it as being ""okay"", even somewhat ""good"", but nowhere near being ""Top 10"" or even ""Top 30"" material!!)
In fact, my reasons matched some of those of the ones here who have given the movie just 1 or 2 stars, and generally thought the movie to be HORRIBLE!!

But then I watched it last night again.
And one year later, on SECOND watching, I INSTANTLY thought ""Maggie & Annie"" to be worth FIVE stars!!!
And, funny enough, for the SAME reasons I'd discounted the flick a year ago!!

Too many lesbian movie cliches and stereotypes.
Bad audio in parts.
Sad Sad SAD ending!!
And the lack of HOT sex scenes and abundant nudity!!

But look again!!
Yes, the ""lez"" was a jock and worked in a ""man's"" job.
Yes, the emotions were at times overwrought.
The acting wasn't of Award-Winning caliber.

And yet, all those things could be overlooked if you look for movies to do what I want them to do.
To evoke an emotional response from me, the viewer!!
(Same goes for books, songs, artworks, etc.)
And this movie did that!!

I cried throughout this movie, and I'm a 68 year old white male heterosexual!!
The scene in the bar when they slow dance, and realize they LOVE each other!!
The gentle loving nature of the husband. (If only we could all be that compassionate and loving!!)
The scene when Annie goes to Maggie's the day before she leaves.
And of course, the truly tragic ending!!

Okay, so it's SAPPY!!
But sometimes sappy is GOOD!!
(""The Bridges of Madison County"", ""Notting Hill"")

Pick up this movie, sit down (with some hankies!!) for a couple of hours,close your minds......but open your hearts.....and ENJOY this wonderful (mostly unknown) little lesbian movie!!

P.S. I'm not sure EXACTLY where I'll move this movie in my next list, but I'm CERTAIN it will be VERY high on my list, and DEFINITELY in the Top 30!!",1358812800,,2166,4.535897435897436
8021106,1,B00023BLSK,"I saw this movie on Netflix. For free. So I'm glad I didn't pay the full price I see here advertised!

I have to agree with the other reviews: Horrible. Not just the quality of the film, the shots, music, editing, plotline, etc... the psychology was horrible too.

The stereotypes were insane! Lol Did anyone else notice the husband was ALWAYS either ""mechanically"" dirty, or ""under the car"" giving it a fix (must be one broken car!) while his wife cheated on him with an attractive out-going (boy-ish) lesbian? A lot of tears. A LOT of tears on the girls parts... yeeesh !

Also, we get it, they're in love. But what about the husband? It seemed SO out of character for him to completely put his own thoughts and emotions to the side just to ask ""are you ok?"" because his wife missed her girlfriend.

Everything just seemed fake. I found this on Netflix looking for the movie classic ""Annie"" to no avail. Friends and I being bored, we saw this and its description and said ""Ah, what the heck...."" We actually can't believe we pulled through!

The characters were weak. The mother has a 7 year old daughter, yet she acts like a teenager. Being influenced by her new girlfriend and acting like she's starting her life again with no responsibilities or consideration to other people. The husband had to be the one to remind her (again, ignoring his own feelings) that Maggie had no one! Maggie wasn't married or coupled. Poor thing!

The little girl was clueless.

The end. :)

Watch for a good laugh. Or if you're so excruciatingly bored, that you'll learn there are worse things out there than being bored.",1316736000,2,1606,4.590909090909091
8021107,2,B00023BLSK,"I was laughing at some of the clever reviews. Let's face it.  It's hard to find a lot of really good lesbian flicks.  There aren't many unfortunately so I lower my standards.  I wanted to give this movie a two star rating because I was moderately entertained and I like to root for the underdog.  There were too many one star ratings for my taste.

The performances were a little lackluster and I admit to fast forwarding through the love scenes.  They got a bit tedious.  I found the storyline a little hard to swallow, how the married gal never loved any woman before nor would she again (yeah, right) and particularly how understanding the husband was of the relationship (hoping for a threesome?).  I think the movie had missed potential.  Perhaps if the gals would just stop acting maybe and be more natural?  And some major tweaking of the storyline to something that feels more realistic.

I think the thing that irked me the most was killing the lesbian at the end.  WHY did they go there?!?  Don't they realize the lesbian audience gets to see more than its fair share of that kind of thing already??",1255996800,2,1109,4.540404040404041
8021108,1,B00023BLSK,"Up until tonight, The Cable Guy was the worst movie I'd ever seen. But I have reached a new low.

1) constant, nondescript, third-string lesbian folk music (and random kokopelli) throughout the ENTIRE movie, with no correlation to scene
2) sound quality so terrible, you can hear cars throughout, and some parts are deafening, others are whispers
3) Terrible camera angles. The close-ups are way too close... lots of cut-off chins.
4) psychotic psychotherapist
5) boring-as-ef sex scenes
6) CRYING KISSING. No more crying kissing in lesbian movies! Just say no!
7) Really bad acting. Really really bad.
8) The least flattering wardrobe ever. Movie came out in 2002. There's no excuse, people.
9) OVERACTING
10) stupid cliches like: ""I loved you the first second I saw you"" and ""I was never attracted to a woman before you...""
11) The annoying eyebrow-raising schmuck friend who you want to punch
12) A whole lot more that you'd have to watch the movie for.

But all of these things I could handle in small doses. Listen, I'm someone who genuinely LIKES low culture, and I hated this movie. This is because instead of being the 20-minute short film it should have been, it was stretched to a dreadful 120 minutes. At least 40% of the scenes aren't needed. 90% of the scenes are way, way too long. The pauses between lines of dialogue are too long, too. How many melodramatic facial expressions do we need to know that they're having a hard time? Yes. It's tough. We get it. Now spit out your lines.

This movie is only for the bravest of the brave, for the true, diehard fans of bottom-barrel low culture. It won't be pretty. Whatever you do, do not watch this alone.

Here is something you can do to help you make this movie more bearable. Make Dyke Movie Bingo Boards with the following spaces on them:
1) denim vests
2) special sexy candle time (breast fondling and fade to candles)
3) generic folk music
4) Miller Lite
5) softball, rugby or basketball
6) falling for your best friend
7) crying-kissing
8) gay bashing
9) mechanics/car repair
10) jealous/befuddled boyfriend/husband
11) mullets
12) matching lesbo couple hair
13) skeezy chick at bar
14) love at first sight
15) ""you turned me gay""
16) overexplanation of lesbian motifs

8021109,3,B00023BLSK,"This is a fun and cute, indie type film. It can be a little unrealistic in terms of some of the conversations that take place and the lack of reaction or emotion in these conversations, but at the end of the day it is another lesbian film so you have to love it. (The sound changes mid-scene can be a little annoying though)
If you are looking for a movie to give you an idea of how things might unfold if a married woman falls for another woman - this probably isn't the movie for you due to just how unrealistic it seems.",1208217600,,523,4.087378640776699
