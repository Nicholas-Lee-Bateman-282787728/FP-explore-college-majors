2692376,5,B000KJU2DG,"If you're looking for practical data, and have some level of understanding stances and hands, it covers the possible practical uses as a defense weapon.",1370304000,,152,5.12
2692377,5,B000KJU2DG,"Well made, good sound, good instruction.
The video quality is excellent but you have to be patient and wait for the instruction for the form as early in the video there are beautiful seines but the instruction of the forms is later.",1360540800,2,232,4.5476190476190474
2692378,3,B000KJU2DG,If you are looking forward plenty of practical Cane self-defense techniques I would look elsewhere. If you are interested in a Tai Chi Cane set then this might be just the DVD for you. The long staff section I found less useful than the cane. There were a few moves and some instruction that was worthwhile. Just not enough to justify the price.,1266364800,6,345,4.492063492063492
2692379,5,B000KJU2DG,"I got even more than I expected from this DVD. The cane portion of the video is fantastic. It begins with a run-though of various self defense applications of many different cane techniques. Then, it shows how many of those manuvers are used as a Tai Chi form. Finally, it teaches you how to do a complete Tai Chi routine with your cane.

The staff portion was not quite as complete (in my opinion) as the cane segment, but it was still excellent in its own right. There is no direct combat/self-defense demonstrations, but they do take you through the proper ways to hold your bo, how to strike, and ultimately lead you through several different routines, shown from multiple angles.

Overall this DVD is an excellent resource on cane & staff techniques.",1206403200,13,755,4.669172932330827

8157548,1,B000KJU2DG,"I began studying martial arts in 1968.  In 1973, I received my instructor's certification (Five Family Kung Fu).  I realized my knowledge was not complete.  Studied from another master from 1975 until 2002 (studied Hakka Kung fu, Sil Lum Kung Fu and Yang style Tai Chi Chuan.

This video was a disappointment.  The two instructors seem sincere.  Their techniques are not developed.  The gentleman who thinks he is teaching Tai Chi is not.",1420848000,6,438,4.917808219178082

8157550,5,B000KJU2DG,This is a good introduction for self defense using a staff or cane.  I learned a lot from the DVD.  The authors present the topic in a careful and understandable manner.,1401840000,2,169,4.419354838709677
