In America I remember the video for Goodbye being played on MTV. It was beautiful and sad at the same time to hear and watch because they knew and we all knew that this was the end of an era of real good fun positive Girl Power. I just wished they could have lasted a little while longer as a hit selling group. Here in the USA their last two songs and videos for the singles Holler and Let Love Lead the Way weren't even released. Too bad because they are great. That is why I bought this DVD. To have the Spice Girls forever. My only issue with this DVD is that there are no extra bonus features. Even so, I still rate this DVD 5 stars because the videos and songs are wonderful.",1139875200,3,844,4.059880239520958
