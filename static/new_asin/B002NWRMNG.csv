3960269,5,B002NWRMNG,"I just watched this. On PBS. It's such a vivid representation of the times of my father who was born in this era. All his stories of ""why"" a dust bowl are here. And how our parks and trails were built, and our saving environmental actions came to being...here. Dad was in Ag. (a Dean of Ag Econ.) He told these depression stories- that also hit his poor farm family hard in East Tenn. They kept going somehow farming, selling hooked rugs to the north. This film represents surviving.
I loved the long unseen images, stories of those that were ""just poor"" in these times of soup kitchens, and our great depression, and what was ""done about it."" Learning of society through the words of ordinary people was brilliant to carry this film's story. It fits, you are narrated through the many voices, through how it felt to be there, how getting that work in the CCC offered hope and put desperate people into productive solutions.  Dad always said something I heard here, it was as close to a possible revolution as he ever wanted to come to in our country. If you watch these times and how Roosevelt responded, the forces that opposed it, how the CCC came to be, it's there.
People were reduced so low, this shows you this and builds a compassionate response. That is there too and what might have been, and how it was going in countries across the oceans too, that is there. In the film someone says the seeds were there to bring the country into complete revolt....against this we see what FDR built, this film shows what can be. It seems so relevant now-and I propose it is what we need now. Understanding the missions and work of the CCCer's, built with so many out of work- now it seems we also need a dynamic work movement- seems so essential to consider a context that puts this into a national model of hope and healing. Heal the man, heal the land, the film says was the slogan of this conservation movement. It seems so important we listen now.  As the film says of Roosevelt, the perfect match of man and moment, this New Deal was made. Work more important than relief. Watching the CCC develop here...its design, its emphasis on conservation, the vision, it really must be watched to renew your understandings.

3960290,5,B002NWRMNG,It told the story with many personal accounts of people who were in it.  It was one of the best and well rounded accounts of the Civilian Conservation Corps you could possibly get.  You get a real feel of what it was like to be involved in it and what it meant to the country!!  LOVED IT!!!!,1389657600,,291,4.0701754385964914
3960291,5,B002NWRMNG,"My 93 year old father enjoyed this video very much, he was a big part of this movement. He also said ""they got thier facts straight""",1388361600,,132,4.115384615384615
3960292,5,B002NWRMNG,My grandfather was in a CCC camp in North Carolina. It was great to finally understand the scope of what the CCC's contributed. They have left quite a legacy for all of us who enjoy National Parks.,1381622400,,197,4.351351351351352
3960293,5,B002NWRMNG,"After watching this movie several times on DVD's from netflix, I bought it! If you have never seen this movie and are interested in the human spirit- how Americans survive, and especially now with the economy the way that it is- get this movie. I have watched it at least six times and get more out of it every time. My students love it. It is very inspirational on many levels- historically and a story of what people will do to make the best of a situation!",1378771200,,459,4.287356321839081
3960294,5,B002NWRMNG,"We ordered this for our sons in whom we are wanting to instill a love of working with their hands.  It is a wonderful look at the lives of several men who joined the CCC during the depression because of lack of work. We loved the inclusion of many film clips of enthusiastic young men learning carpentry, masonry and other skills.  The interviews of the men years later, and one man's tears at some of his memories of the Depression was very meaningful for our family.  The movie also brings out the importance of soil conservation and caring for the environment in general. Many good messages here - we highly recommend it.",1370822400,,624,4.553571428571429
3960295,5,B002NWRMNG,"My children were home on a break from college and we watched this together on the History Channel.  The show is full of personal notes from actual members of the CCC and the historical perspective provided us with more than one discussion on history, government programs, culture, etc.  Will be adding this DVD to our family's collection.",1344384000,,338,4.912280701754386
3960296,5,B002NWRMNG,"Wept thru beginning of this amazing footage, staring into 1930s hardscrable, hungry fellow American eyes and faces as they queued up for soup kitchens or to jump a RR car -- looking for work. Also intently watching the numbers floating by of how many Conservation Corps camps in each state -- and US Territories -- I discovered my Dust Bowl home-state of Oklahoma hosted 52 alone.
But it never dawned on me before, these 2 to 3 million men (18- 25 years of age) - working for $30/month on 3 'square meals' per day -- were our countries ""first environmentalists"".  The word itself -- ""environment"" -- didn't even exist until Franklin Delano Roosevelt stepped up to the plate as our enlightened president.
What a heritage he and his men left for future generations -- seeding and salvaging our nation's forests and topsoil & building and conserving places like Camp David and Carlsbad Cavern, along with multiple, memorable state parks and cabins.
Yet perhaps their most significant endowment manifests in a trans-generational 'ethic of conservation' that still abides -- if in need of some inspiration, such as embodied in this instructive documentary. The good news: we've already done it once before.",1329436800,4,1201,5.005
3960297,5,B002NWRMNG,My dad was panning for gold to try to feed us. With out the CCC I don't know what would have happened.  Dad went.into the USFS right after the CCC.  He spent the rest of his happy life there. I'm so thankful for FDR.  I was horrified to find that my Grandson hear nothing about the CCC in High School.  That is why I ordered this Program.,1301184000,5,338,4.0
3960298,5,B002NWRMNG,"I saw this program a few years ago and was inspired to find and watch it again since beginning a class about society and the environment in history. Again, I was deeply moved at this account of Americans working together to overcome adversity. The CCC was such a healing effort for both the people and the land here in America. Today's crises may be different but we are in no less need of healing.

Agriculturally, we face GMO tragedies, epic use of pesticides and an economic infrastructure that has disabled most farms from operating without subsidies. While not at 25% as in the 30's, unemployment is unacceptably high. To watch this program makes one ache for another such undertaking and turnaround here in the United States.

Additionally, it is amazing to look at the number of CCC camps that were in every state in the nation (42 here in Vermont, 108 in Michigan....) where otherwise unemployed, literally starving young men were working in fair conditions, making a fair wage and being well fed and cared for. If you go out and enjoy state parks, hiking trails and other natural wonders, know that most of it was created by this incredible effort.

I found this movie uplifting and very interesting to watch.",1296777600,6,1218,4.76303317535545
3960299,5,B002NWRMNG,"hello thank you so much for this dvd. I bought it for a wonderful man at the nursing home in his 90's who remembered when he was in one of these work camps when the country was going down in the past.

I played it for him yesterday and it was worth the price of admission. I saw it on channel 11 PBS program.

Thank you so much. This was an american experience that has been forgotten. It really shows the wisdom beyond his years (FDR).
Thank you again.",1277251200,13,453,4.078651685393258

8375501,5,B002NWRMNG,"My father was in the CCCs just before World War II and spoke of it with great affection.  He was one of those that the DVD mentions that lived on the road hopping on and off freight trains.  I will always believe that the CCC saved him and allowed him to be successful later in life.  This DVD tells the story beautifully of how it saved an entire generation of young men in this country and allowed them to be prepared to help save the world after Pearl Harbor.  It was the perfect thing at the perfect time and something that would definitely be worth resurrecting again.  This is just a great, great story.",1431820800,,609,4.307017543859649
8375502,5,B002NWRMNG,I think the American Experience series is generally great; this DVD was another excellent history lesson for me.  If I had had this series when I was younger I would have loved history instead of barely tolerating it in school.,1430006400,,227,4.675

8375504,5,B002NWRMNG,"We get a well organized documentary of the CCC and what it was like to be there. The story of three million men put to work by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the legacy that they left us.

He story is told thru a hand full of people that lived through the time. It is supplemented with moving pictures and photographs. There is a film clip of John Wayne in ""Three Faces West"" (1940) describing the usefulness of sticking together. Jonathan Alter was one of the writers and narrator; he is the author of ""FDR's 100 Days and the Triumph of Hope.""

Everything moves so fast that you will want to watch the presentation over again for missed details.",1409788800,,651,4.46218487394958
8375505,4,B002NWRMNG,"This was a gift for someone but apparently the recipient is happy with the purchase.  When reading about this particular film, it makes me wonder why in this modern day economic crisis this kind of program is not being implemented? The Great Depression was discussed in great detail in college history class and this takes me back to a research paper I wrote about FDR and the CCC. I don't want to get all political on my soapbox here because this review is about an actual item not a time in history. I will just close with the fact that we are living in a modern-day version of what the 1930s were like, it's just that we don't have that same sticking-together attitude more typical of a time that hadn't lost its core values, and we certainly don't have a President willing to maintain secure border patrol.",1406678400,,810,4.510204081632653
8375506,5,B002NWRMNG,"This is a wonderful tribute to the men of the CCC and the work they performed.  Three million men served in the CCC, and yet most people today have never even heard of it.  We need a revival of this organization and the work they performed.  With so many today
accepting welfare and thinking that it is beneath their dignity to work (yet not to accept handouts!) I guess it would not work  And yet
there is plenty of work that needs to be done.  Our parks are understaffed and falling apart.  The CCC built and maintained them.
And, when World War II came, there was a body of 3,000,000 physically fit men, used to military training and discipline (the camps
were run by military officers) ready for service.  Today, only one in four of our youth could pass a military physical..  All this is showcases in this wonderful tribute  to the CCC.  Highly recommended!",1406505600,2,862,4.503225806451613
8375507,5,B002NWRMNG,"As a History instructor at a community college, this documentary has been a huge hit for the past 4 semesters.  Some students have returned the following week to let me know their grandfathers were in the CCC.  The historical footage wonderfully supports the memories of four terrific men who found new lives because of FDR's program.  Highly recommend for the classroom.",1405728000,,371,5.049180327868853
