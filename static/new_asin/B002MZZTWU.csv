8374375,2,B002MZZTWU,"""Mission to Venice"" is a very mediocre outing for Sinister Cinema to bring to us.  The black-and-white film from 1964 stars an almost uncharismatic star, Sean Flynn and Ettore Manni, Pierre Mondy, Karin Baal, Madeline Robinson and Hannes Messemer, among others in a very so-so plot, directed by the books by Andre Versini and with slightly above average jazz music by Alain Goraguer.  The production is a co-France/Italy/West Germany ""pre-Bond"" mystery that seems more like something from television with nothing standing out but that the hero is a school preppy who reminds one in looks of a nervous Shaun Cassidy and plays more like a fifties episode of The Hardy Boys with an uninteresting adult attitude.  The hero won't inhale his cigarettes.  Very unmemorable euro-spy/mystery about whereabouts of a secret document and whether or not the original taker is a traitor.  Routine.  Based on the novel, ""Venetian Mission"" by James Hadley Chase.  Doesn't look like it had much of a budget, scenery only really minimal looking as well.  Overall: bland. Skip it.",1342828800,2,1061,5.127906976744186
