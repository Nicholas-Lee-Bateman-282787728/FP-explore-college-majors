8095457,4,B000C28X9Q,"After Bone Thugz 'n Harmony, that is.

Hilariously bad '70s street gang movie whose juvenile delinquents are about as convincing as Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey were in their 40s as the Bowery Boys. The lead, David Kyle, is so preposterously wrong for the lead role of Cat Murkil (who in hell came up with that name? did the writer actually think that that sounds remotely menacing or tough?) that you have to wonder about the possibility of casting couch issues. He's pretty and stick-thin and looks like Lilian Gish could take him down with one whack of her cane.

While much of the onscreen goings-on are laughably inept and unthreatening, the narrative is occasionally punched up with some surprisingly brutal violence (I'm thinking of the showerroom assault here), including a pretty ugly rape scene (be warned).

These jarring tonal shifts, though, are part of the campy fun, as far as I'm concerned, blunt reminders of how bad a filmmaker you could be in the good old days of drive-ins and grindhouses and still get away with it. (Nowadays Quentin Tarantino co-opts this 'style' and gets Oscars for it. Crazy world.)",1402617600,,1120,4.853403141361256
