8017102,3,B0001WDLLM,"Honestly only watched it for Marlee Matlin, but it was...ok. The writing wasn't very strong, and the directing wasn't exactly topnotch, but the actors did a good job and really pulled it together. -- There were many scenes where the main character's lines didn't seem to fit her making the scenes fall awkwardly flat. I would blame that on the writing though. At times it felt like they didn't have a strong enough grasp on the character's voice. The only way they could get bad ass misfit across was to write her lines as a middle-aged man ""I just wanna be home ,watch tv, and drinkin' a beer"". The tone for that particular character bounce in and out trying to attempt ""hurt girl acting out"" ... but it just didn't work out.  Nevertheless...  I'd probably watch it again if I was bored.",1514160000,,788,4.542253521126761

8017104,3,B0001WDLLM,"This is a cute little gem. A brash young woman Ruth (Samantha Mathis)can't seem to accept the fact that she's disabled. After her grandmother dies Ruth's family sticks her into a place for mentally and physically disabled people.

She meets an interesting mixture of people, Lenny (Jonathan Silverman) who is blind, Eleanor (Natalie Cole) who has been left with a speech impediment after a car accident, a quirky deaf roommate (Marlee Matlin) and a fellow wheelchair user Cal (Peter Saarsgard) with whom she falls in love.

Ruth is forced to accept her new predicament and it leads her on a journey where she learns more about herself as well as those around her. She finally begins to accept her fate as a disabled person and with that, softens her heart.

This is a nice little movie that's enjoyable for the entire family. It reestablishes the importance of getting to know people for who they are and not what they seem to be.",1335398400,,930,4.728395061728395
8017105,5,B0001WDLLM,"This little-known movie was wonderfully enlightening relative to just how quickly our lives can change.  It also reminds us that the sudden death of a loved one can be devestating.  Additionally, the movie shows us how some family members can be cold hearted and unwilling to assist those in need.  The struggles of the physically challenged female were presented with great sensitivity and insight, as the characters were incredibly well-developed. The sad details of each of thier respective lives reminds us that life is often cruel and unfair.  We also see how people, when motivated, can overcome challenges and rise to new heights when given good cause.  Being a Clincial Therapist, I was overcome with a confluence of intense emotions where empathy and compassion filled my psyche. Watching the personal growth of the lead character was fascinating and I was sorry to see the story end without telling us how she did in the long term.  This stellar movie should be a working part of any metriculated academic study program that prepares people for a career in venues of mental health and/or counseling.  Simply put, the movie ""Freak City"" is a classic and I loved the story. Natlie Cole was mesmerizing. This movie is a ""must see"" for anyone to whom taking life forgranted and/or likes to whine and complain about the mundane.  Thanks!  Capt. Rick Rotundo",1270771200,4,1362,4.964757709251101
8017106,4,B0001WDLLM,"This film really deserves a DVD release. It's about a rebellious young woman who is put against her will in an institution, and about the people with various disabilities she meets there. Her roommate, played by Marlee Matalin, is developmentally disabled. She falls in love with a young man who is a quadriplegic (played by Peter Sarsgaard), and while I was not so happy with the ending, overall it's a very sensitive portrayal of disability, and even darkly funny in many places.",1247616000,7,481,4.878048780487805
