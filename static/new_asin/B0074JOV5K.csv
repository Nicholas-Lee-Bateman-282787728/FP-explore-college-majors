8510020,3,B0074JOV5K,"This is NOT a movie with a plot  it is an excuse to get as many music clips as is possible in the allotted time.  This is not a bad thing except WAY too much TRAD JAZZ  was NEVER a fan  however  made up for by some GREAT performances by the reason I bought this in the first place
The LIST is on the label Craig Douglas, Helen Shapiro, Gene Vincent, Gene McDaniels, Gary US Bonds, Chubby Checker, Del Shannon and John Leyton  all fab and worth wading thru the rest of the music  for those who LIKE Trad Jazz  you will LOVE this movie",1446940800,,533,4.0095238095238095
8510021,5,B0074JOV5K,The film is wonderful,1439510400,,21,4.5
8510022,5,B0074JOV5K,"Ring-Ding- Rhythm was released in 1962. A film slanted towards the British teens of the time. Plot involves putting on a rock show. Peppered with American singers Chubby Checker, Del Shannon, and Gary U.S. Bonds. Fans of pop music of the 1960's will like this the most.",1437264000,,269,4.74468085106383
8510023,4,B0074JOV5K,"A copy in script of another English movie of the 60's called Just for Fun and the songs she sang weren't as good as the one she sang in Play it Cool
performed backstage.  It sounded more Rock N Roll.",1427155200,,199,3.975
8510024,3,B0074JOV5K,"a copy of the american version of ""it's trad,dad"".  a lot of visual flutter on the recording, but the jazz sequences (which prompted me to buy it) aren't too bad. the 'story' is just an excuse to feature the rather contrived musical sequences. the american inserts aren't particularly impressive, but the jazz bands fare rather better (although, again, rather contrived).  at least the sound is all right.  on balance, worth having - but I'll use the fast-forward button when replaying.",1425600000,,486,5.05
8510025,5,B0074JOV5K,"Really a music video linked with a tongue-in-cheek plot.  This movie had me up and dancing in my lounge room.  It was funny too, but really you had to have been alive at the time to appreciate it.  Great sound-track, wonderful jazz, some crooning to make your heart beat faster.  Loved it.",1367798400,5,289,4.5
8510026,1,B0074JOV5K,"This is the worst musical I've ever seen, period.  This British production trots out the familiar theme of teens against the Man and trying to organize a show.  This is an excuse to parade some of the lamest trad-jazz bands in creation who dominated the British charts at the time.  Interspersed are film clips of American acts(Gene Vincent, Chubby Checker, Del Shannon, Gary U.S. Bonds, and Gene McDaniels) who seem bored at the very least.  This film testifies as to why it was imperative for the Beatles and The Rolling Stones to emerge from this dreary scene.  Speaking of the Beatles the movie was directed in lackluster fashion by Richard Lester who only two years later would break cinematic ground with ""A Hard Day's Night"".  It's inexplicable that Lester could be associated with such dreck and I guess he's cognizant of it as well.",1357430400,3,841,4.805555555555555
8510027,5,B0074JOV5K,"I reckon Richard Lester's first feature filmn, ""Ring-A-Ding Rhythm"" (aka ""It's Trad, Dad) is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. An affectionate send-up of the Cliff Richard-type pop musical of the time, the films's Goonish satire and old-fashioned slapstick keeps things going at a cracking pace with one fantastic jazz and pop number after another. Today it is something of an historical time capsule featuring some of the biggest acts from both sides of the Atlantic pre-Beatles - Helen Shapiro, Chubby Checker, Gary US Bonds, John Leyton, Acker Bilk, The Temperance Seven, Gene Vincent, Gene McDaniels, the great Del Shannon and more. It's cast of supporting characters are hilarious as the leads, Helen Shapiro and Craig Douglas, deal with a fuddy-duddyish anti-pop music Mayor and all-too-busy radio disc jockeys as they try to hold a concert in their home town. While Lester went on to work with Beatles and make some of the best films of the 1960s and '70s, ""Ring-A-Ding Rhthm"" is a fun film that can be watched over and over again. It is immensely enjoyable fun. And I won't spoil a thing when I say the kids win in the end.",1352246400,7,1142,4.802030456852792
