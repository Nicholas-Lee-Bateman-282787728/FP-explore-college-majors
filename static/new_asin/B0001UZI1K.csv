8016550,1,B0001UZI1K,"The other reviewers pretty much summed up the main problems with this video, but did anyone happen to notice that the first ""customer review"" and the editorial review are almost identical?  Also, the music is praised so much because the director and composer share the same last name.... brothers?

Thanks to the other reviewers (and the friend of mine who let me borrow his copy) for your honesty and helping me to make the decision to find another product to help me further my lampworking knowledge and techniques.",1121990400,2,517,4.863636363636363
8016551,1,B0001UZI1K,"Please don't waste your money. I'm a self-taught glass lampworker, and I bought this DVD on a whim to see if it held anything new. This is the worst instructional DVD for lampworking I've seen.

The anonymous, 5-star review below from someone entitled ""Best video on the Market"" leads me to believe that reviewer is the DVD-maker himself. Why? He sells this DVD on a popular auction site, and when anyone leaves him negative feedback there, he replies to the bad review with ""Best Video on market!"", just like the reviewer below does! His response to me there was, ""Have you even watched it?? It's the Best Video on the Market!"" When buyers leave negative feedback about the bad music, he replies with the words ""fabulous"" and ""marvelous"" just like the reviewer below does.

It would be great to see the DVD-maker make positive changes for his next DVD based on buyer's constructive feedback, rather than blowing people off.

1.) Annoying music plays endlessly. The ""Best Video on the Market"" review below states the music is ""classical"" music.  No, it's not.  It sounds like a bad band playing in a neighbor's garage.  The very *few* times the instructor speaks, the music is so loud it's hard to hear him.

2.) The instructor makes nice items, but shares little of the HOW - WHY - WHAT - WHEN of what he's doing.  Example of the third-person narration from the DVD:  ""Brad picks up mandrel"" and ""Brad puts mandrel in flame,"" and then nothing but music for many minutes in between.  It's obvious to us that he's picking up a mandrel, but why not teach by explaining all the steps?

Very little about supplies or safety is explained.  Students should be taught how to hold the mandrel, which part of the flame is hottest, where to hold the mandrel in the flame for varied results, how many seconds or minutes are needed for each step, etc. All of that is missing from this DVD.

You're better off buying some other glass bead making book or DVD with justifiable high-ratings. If you are visual learner, look for a book with color photos to help illustrate steps.",1117670400,7,2062,4.647382920110193
8016552,1,B0001UZI1K,"I agree that the only person who could possibly find this video helpful is the director/producer himself.

Don't buy this, it's a waste of money.

I have found many books like, ""Flameworking"", to be much more helpful than any part of this video.",1096416000,4,245,4.674418604651163
8016553,1,B0001UZI1K,"I bought this video due in large part to the first review. I strongly suspect that the only person who could have given this video such a review is the author himself.

 Throughout the whole video, techniques are not explained, but horrible background music is played.....what a bummer! The following excerpts will give you an idea of how the video is narrated:
 ""Brad is now picking up the glass.""
 ""Brad places the punt(?) back in the flame""
 ""Brad switches to his left hand.""

 Don't get me wrong. The artist produced first rate products, but ""how"" it was done was not explained.

 Simply do not bother with this video if you really want to learn lampworking basics.",1091750400,7,669,4.698275862068965
