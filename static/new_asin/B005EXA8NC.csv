8469253,5,B005EXA8NC,"I viewed this film without any knowledge of its plot, storyline, but only that it starred Van Johnson and introduced Janet Leigh, one of my favorite actresses. Purposely, I have always refrained from reading critics reviews or viewers comments as I have always found them interfering with the filmmakers intent and manner of cinematic storytelling. When the plot, especially the film's ending, is revealed it's tantamount to someone yelling ""The butler did it!!!"" I prefer the thrill of the writer, director and producer to display a film that will provide the utmost in entertainment. And that's exactly what they did for this wonderful motion picture.",1472428800,,653,5.228571428571429
8469254,5,B005EXA8NC,"Some movies you never get tired of viewing and The Romance of Rosy Ridge with Van Johnson was for me.  If you like Van Johnson and films made around the 1860's, you will love this film.",1458518400,,185,4.138888888888889
8469255,4,B005EXA8NC,"In the Ozark Mountains, as throughout Missouri, sentiment regarding the ideas of slavery and secession was mixed.  In the summer of 1865, Gill MacBean (Thomas Mitchell), who served for a time with the Confederate forces (why he came home before the war ended is never explained, but he may have been captured and paroled, a common occurrence), and his wife Sairy (Selena Royle), along with their teenage daughter Lissy Anne (Janet Leigh) and young son Andrew (Dean Stockwell), are waiting to see whether elder son Ben (Marshall Thompson), also Southern in sympathy, will return too.  Feelings run high in the Agony Creek region, where neighbors now turn their backs on each other because their men served on different sides--and to add to the ill sentiment, a band of masked night riders is making free throughout the district, torching the houses and barns of former Confederates, which quite naturally leads everyone to believe they must be Unionists.  The ex-Rebs, understandably, resolve to band together against them, led by Gil and the Dessarks, John (Charles Dingle) and his grown son Badge (Jim Davis).  Then into the picture comes Henry Carson (Van Johnson), a harmonica-playing wanderer (and, as he presently reveals, former schoolmaster) whose military breeches are so badly faded that no one can tell which color they were originally.  Henry won't say which side he served on, but as time goes by he works steadily, if subtly, to bring the two factions back together--and wins Lissy's love.  Gill doesn't approve, but Sairey helps and supports her daughter, and in the end it's through Henry's efforts that the truth about the night riders is revealed and Ben's fate becomes known (it isn't what you think).  Full of beautiful scenery and well-played human interaction, this slow-paced but unexpectedly ""grabbing"" story may surprise you in its ability to suck you in.",1451433600,2,1879,5.120915032679738
8469256,4,B005EXA8NC,"We bought this for my aunt, who remembers seeing one of the scenes filmed in Santa Cruz, CA!  She really enjoyed watching it, and we did too.",1422835200,2,141,4.222222222222222
8469257,5,B005EXA8NC,"Very good ""old"" movie that shows you the problems the soldiers had returning from the Civil War just as our soldiers throughout history (Viet Nam etc) have had.",1419984000,3,160,4.75
8469258,5,B005EXA8NC,"Van Johnson, always excellent and Janet Leigh's debut performance is quite good. I love the old films about farm and rural life. This one takes place just after the Civil War and tensions were still running high against both sides from neighbors, friends and even relatives. Excellent movie!",1417392000,3,291,5.083333333333333
8469259,5,B005EXA8NC,Great movie,1416873600,,11,5.0
