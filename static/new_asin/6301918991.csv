7816952,5,6301918991,"Jim teaches you how to make small boxes.  But the tape is full of techniques on how to do small piece sawing, grain matching, setting angle cuts, gluing, and fixing mistakes.  There is a lot you can learn from this tape even if you never make a box.
Jim makes you feel welcome to his shop like you were an old friend.  He's a friendly, almost ""aw shucks"" sort of guy.
Seeing this tape inspired me to make a lot of boxes and associated items.  Jim describes boxes that are great for quick projects, gifts, or craft show sales.
Jim was an early editor of Fine Woodworking and was running a custom picture framing shop at the time of this video.
This is a fine production and an excellent teaching video.",971395200,14,701,4.32824427480916
