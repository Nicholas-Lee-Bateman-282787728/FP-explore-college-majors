2479885,5,B000E1DUKM,Excellent DVD for the money.  I enjoyed the series when it was on TV.  Now I can watch it whenever I want.,1410480000,,106,3.772727272727273
2479886,4,B000E1DUKM,"I loved this series and the movie specials that followed, that don't seem to be in circulation",1409529600,,94,4.588235294117647
2479887,5,B000E1DUKM,I enjoyed the show when it first came on ..decided on a whim to order it..I am savouring each episode.  Like all police dramas a little contrived but I like the Sci-Fi whimsy of Alien Nation.  Plus the theme song has always been a toe tapper for me.,1406937600,,249,4.166666666666667
2479888,5,B000E1DUKM,I loved it when it first came out and I truly enjoyed watching it again. But why isn't there Season 2 on prime instant video?,1406073600,,125,4.04
2479889,5,B000E1DUKM,Alien Nation was a good formula cop show with a twist; one of the cops is an alien.  It makes the tired idea actually fresh and there is just enough humor to keep it moving along nicely.,1388793600,2,186,4.027027027027027
2479890,5,B000E1DUKM,This is my all time favorite TV show.  I think all the main characters and actors are fabulous and their the onscreen chemistry is outstanding.,1377820800,,143,4.72
2479891,3,B000E1DUKM,"I CHOSE THIS RATING DUE TO SCRIPT AND THE TECHNOLOGY. The story is pretty good but, storyline is really reaching. I do like the imagination of all those involved in creating this series.",1365379200,,186,4.666666666666667
2479892,5,B000E1DUKM,"I rented this on Prime to show my ceramics class. They were working on something called""Project From Another Planet"".I thought of the premise of the project after seeing Alien nation many years ago! The students had to create an object from another planetary culture. Watching this really sparked their imaginations!",1362614400,,316,5.34
2479893,4,B000E1DUKM,"I enjoyed this when it was briefly on TV, and I still enjoy it! I was happy when I discovered the movies that finished the series, too!",1355875200,4,135,4.037037037037037
2479894,5,B000E1DUKM,"ATTENTION AMAZON please make available the alien nation movies available for download. I love this series and will buy, the download is what i have been waiting for.  Thank you.",1337990400,8,177,4.9
2479895,5,B000E1DUKM,I have always loved this show.,1468800000,,30,4.166666666666667
2479896,5,B000E1DUKM,I watched this series when it came out originally  and was always disappoint that it didn't continue. The series had a lot of lessons to teach on tolerance.,1462320000,,156,4.571428571428571
2479897,5,B000E1DUKM,"This show's relationship between Earthers & the Aliens that they suddenly have to give refuge to is a conversation on immigration in the US and super with our government's current struggle to be fair to both the hungry masses ""at our shores yearning to be free"" (to paraphrase the Statue of Liberty) and the needs of the existing population. 10 stars if I could. The 5 movies made after the one and only season are excellent as well, but unfortunately are not streaming on prime; well worth getting on DVD, I did.",1450137600,3,513,4.586956521739131
2479898,5,B000E1DUKM,needed to see again,1446163200,,19,4.0
2479899,5,B000E1DUKM,One of the best sci-fi shows located in comparatively current times. The clothes and some of the slang is dated. But for those of us who lived through the Eighty's and Ninety's it is great fun. I would love to see the TV Movies that were made to continue the story after the show was prematurely canceled be made available on streaming video.,1438819200,,342,4.444444444444445
2479900,3,B000E1DUKM,A solid sci-fi film with a message that may seem tiresome today but considering this was made in the 90's it is great.,1437868800,,118,4.173913043478261
2479901,5,B000E1DUKM,"One of the seldom mentioned, but best sci-fi series broadcast in the 1990's. A blend of a cop show/sci-fi series with excellent characters that you come to love. No wonder it became a cult hit!",1432339200,,193,4.542857142857143
2479902,5,B000E1DUKM,I wish they would have continued this... it was cool back in the 90's. Season isn't finished and it leaves you with no idea how things turned out.,1423612800,,146,4.25
2479903,3,B000E1DUKM,"The series is pretty good, but some of the seriousness got lost on me because some of the lingo is dated and then the dialogue didn't seem as clever. I'm not sure if I will watch any more past season 1. I think the concept was pretty good. The execution was mostly good. I was not very taken with the subplots of the alien kids.",1414195200,,328,4.061538461538461
2479904,3,B000E1DUKM,was hopping it pick up where the last one ended.  but it didn't .,1412294400,,65,3.642857142857143
8103854,5,B000E1DUKM,"Still as entertaining as when I was a child watching it for the first time, if not more so. If you have seen the original movie and enjoyed it, this should also be a treat.",1526515200,,172,3.942857142857143
8103855,5,B000E1DUKM,No complaints,1525478400,,13,6.0
8103856,5,B000E1DUKM,"I watched this series when it first came out and I loved it then. To rediscover it now  on Amazon was like a big birthday present to ME :D Although some of the language and situations are obviously dated, it holds up really well and watching it again was a joy beyond words.",1523923200,,274,4.169811320754717
8103857,5,B000E1DUKM,Liked it when it first came out.. Like it just as much now..,1519776000,,60,3.6923076923076925
8103858,5,B000E1DUKM,One of the best 1 season TV series available. Just wish the TV movies were available.,1508803200,,85,4.375
8103859,5,B000E1DUKM,Love this show,1493078400,,14,4.0
8103860,5,B000E1DUKM,Either you love it or you hate it.  I loved it when it was on TV and enjoy it more decades later! Sci Fi at it's best!,1491868800,,118,3.3703703703703702
8103861,5,B000E1DUKM,Great,1484784000,,5,5.0
8103862,5,B000E1DUKM,"This series never got the ratings/press it deserved. Unlike most other alien books and films, there are aliens that act in many different ways with many different motivations. They get confused or act out of character. In short - they are much like humans. There are different nutritional needs, a different method of reproduction, different beliefs, different holidays, a different language, etc. The main characters are a human police officer and a newcomer (alien) police officer who are partners. Each of them has much to learn about the other one - both individually and as a species. As a police show, it officers action and whodunit mysteries. As a partnership with such vastly different backgrounds, there is a mix of culture clash, really funny moments when the cultures mix in funny ways (such as the words ""dork"" and ""sikes"" in the alien language).

The show also offers a view of the aliens family life with the newcomer police officer's wife, son and daughter. Within the home, you find out some of the problems the family faces from hurtful ignorance to outright hatred. You also see the process involved when the family decides to have a baby, the issues typical with a rebellious teens with a new twist added from the alien-human conflict, and more.

Even if you are not into science fiction, the series has a lot to offer for anyone who likes to watch shows about social issues, mysteries, a love story that threads throughout the series, and mre.",1481932800,,1464,4.852
8103863,4,B000E1DUKM,"First few are good,after that the episodes are cornier,but somewhat entertaining",1474243200,,80,6.363636363636363
