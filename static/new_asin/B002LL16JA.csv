8373181,1,B002LL16JA,My granddaughter LOVES Mickey Mouse.  However we were unable to use this dvd because it was from the UK and is not compatible with American players.  Very disappointing.,1435190400,,169,5.0
8373182,2,B002LL16JA,"When I purchased this product I was very excited because my son had not yet seen this one and he loves Mickey Mouse.  It was shipped from Scotland so when it arrived it did not work because my DVD is not set up to that region.  I sent a request to return the product, but the seller says it was listed on the website identifying that it was UK oriented. I did not pay attention to this and would not have know what it meant anyway. They did suggest I try to google a code that I could put in my DVD player so it might work. I have not yet done this.  It was my fault I guess, but I was very disappointed.",1367020800,9,604,3.8548387096774195
