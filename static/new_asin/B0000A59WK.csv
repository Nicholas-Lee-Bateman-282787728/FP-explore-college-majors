7995977,5,B0000A59WK,"I liked the US version of ""Times Like These"" for years (The one where they are under a bridge, having everything dropped on them: T.V.s, cars, even a house!).  When I went to buy this particular video from iTunes, they did not have it.  When I bought the ""Greatest Hits"" album by the Foo Fighters, they had an accoustic version (which is also awesome), I was disappointed it wasn't the original.  So, when I found this copy, I was so excited!  There are 3 versions of ""Times Like These.""  Also the music video ""Low"" which is my least favorite (and is on the ""Greatest Hits"" album as well).  I am just happy to get the video I finally want.",1318204800,,639,4.3277310924369745
7995978,5,B0000A59WK,"This Dvd is fill with all three version of Times Like These, And lets not Forget the Music Video that got Banned from MTV, Low. If you've never seen all three Version of Times like These then you've gotta grab this while you can. I love this Dvd wish the Foos would make a DVD set of there music Videos. FOO FIGHTERS RULE!",1202774400,,322,4.126984126984127
7995979,5,B0000A59WK,"there you can find the video o Low with Mr Black and Dave Grohl which has not been broadcast a lot on tv. If you're a foo fighters' fan , that is an item to get!",1142726400,,161,3.5
7995980,5,B0000A59WK,"It's not the greatest DVD but it's well worth the money and really funny. Low is the 3rd funniest Foo Fighters video (1st-""Learn To Fly"" 2nd-""Big Me"") and a little disturbing. ""Times Like These"" is one of the greatest hit songs of this year and the video is awesome with Foo Fighters fans dumping cars, a gameboy, a skateboard, a house, and whole bunch of other stuff, off a bridge aiming near the Foo Fighters. The other 2 ""Times Like These"" videos are also cool. One of my favorite things on the DVD is the Extras which has the ""Coming Soon"" icon. It shows you a preview of all their albums and some footage from all their videos.",1070064000,8,632,4.364406779661017
7995981,5,B0000A59WK,"Who knew that ""self-pleasure"" and using the restroom could get you banned from MTV? Other than these two ""moments"", the video is rather tame. Funny as they come, but tame. I'm willing to watch anything with Dave Grohl and Jack Black, and this is no exception. Sexually experimental red-necks having a night of fun in a hotel room = surefire hilarious time.
In addition, three videos for Times Like These are included: The original US version, the UK version, and an acoustic in-studio version. The in-studio version is amazing, almost better than the regular version of the song, slow moving and heart--wrenching.
All in all this is worth the ""low"" price--get it? hahaha--okay its a lame pun, reference thingy. Hilarity and emotion on one disc. For any fan of the Foos or Tenacious D, or for anyone who is willing to witness the more ""natural"" body functions. Parents of Young Foo fans may be leery about it, though, I guess.",1061510400,13,925,4.7875
