3959162,5,B002NALPFY,I really only ordered it for Salvage because I'd been trying to find it since i watched it a few years back. But why turn down 3 more horror movies that could potentially be as good for the same price?,1381276800,,201,4.05
3959163,4,B002NALPFY,"If you like independent movies with a cutting edge, then this is a good start. In this collection you will get everything, from dark comedic to very serious horror drama, from rural killers to global apocalypse .

This last one is not so bad, is entertaining and the main character is very interesting. Great collection and best of all great price.",1380499200,,2101,7.433734939759036
3959164,5,B002NALPFY,Low budget but Backwoods BloodBath is really entertaining. The other movies were not bad either. Worth the price for me.,1377216000,,120,5.05
3959165,3,B002NALPFY,"I have the Horror Collector's Set (4 films) that includes Bloody Mary, Mortuary, Memory, and Wages Of Sin.  The set I'm reviewing here does not have Wages Of Sin, instead it has Salvage.  I couldn't find the set I own here on Amazon, so I'll review this set that includes Bloody Mary, Mortuary, Memory, and Salvage.

These are low budget B horror movies.  Some are awful, some are mediocre, some are pretty good.  I'll do a breakdown:

Salvage - I haven't seen this, as it's not on my 4 movie DVD set
Mortuary - *** stars
Memory - **** stars
Bloody Mary - ** stars

The best movie is Memory, which stars Billy Zane (of ""Titanic"" fame), Ann-Margret, Dennis Hopper, and Tricia Helfer.

If you're a fan of B and independent horror movies, you might want to give this set a shot.",1367020800,,775,4.408450704225352
3959166,4,B002NALPFY,"All four of these films are well made and at least watchable, and I particularly liked ""Salvage"", which is quite an original film.  ""Mortuary"" was pretty lame, but ""Memory"" was good and ""Bloody Mary"" might be worth watching just for the high T&A count.",1323907200,3,252,4.7272727272727275
3959167,1,B002NALPFY,"In these four movie sets from The Midnight Horror Collection, there is usually one film thats fairly good, while the rest stink. This set, by far, is the worst collection to date.

There are bad movies that entertain, then there are bad movies that never should have been made. That's this set, save for one.

The one that's just ok is The Dead Sleep. It's a bizarre story that tends to lose itself from time to time in it's complicated plot. It's about a guy who has been dead for five years that dreams his way back to his daughter to explain clues he left when he was alive and was haunted by his own ghost, which in reality he was being dreamed of as the ghost five years later. Did I hear you just say ""What?""",1316304000,4,714,4.204379562043796
3959168,5,B002NALPFY,"Buy this double-sided DVD because it is cheap and because it has the movie ""Salvage"".

The DVD has no commentary tracks or special features, but it does contain four movies:

* ""Bloody Mary"" is a passable film with a standard plotline and predictable characters.  No surprises.  2 stars.
* ""Memory"" or ""Mem-(o)-re"" is less predictable than ""Bloody Mary"".  Good actors and effects, a few twists in the tale.  3 stars.
* ""Mortuary"" is more predictable than ""Bloody Mary"" and is a bog-standard, low-budget film.  Tame with little gore. 2 stars.
* ""Salvage"" is creepy, moody, and has some squirm-in-your-seat moments.  It moves along in an almost predictable way until the last few minutes of the film.  Outstanding. 5 stars.

Honestly, you may wish to purchase a single DVD of ""Salvage"" that has a commentary track and other special features.  However, this bare-bones DVD collection gets 5 stars for value, most of that because of ""Salvage"".",1316217600,6,939,4.993548387096774
3959169,4,B002NALPFY,I get upset when i have to keep reviewing over and over again this is the 3rd time i have done this with this one to and i pray i don't have to keep doing this as before its a so so movie,1307923200,,187,3.372093023255814
3959170,3,B002NALPFY,"Many of these sets have movies in them that are either medicore at best or they have one good movie amongst them that inflates the rest. Also, you know the specials ar enot going to be there and that most of these are copies and not original pieces. Still, these are nice things in some ways, allowing you to look at them and enjoy the movies. While I will not say that these are good by themselve,s they are good as a piece that is not really costly. If I had to buy them all alone, I would rate this a 3.2 or so becuse i like it and I do not see myself buying it all. In a set I give it a 3.4 or so, still a 3 but a little better.

About the movies (shortly)

Live animals is about a group of kids that are about having fun. Then they run into a slavery, a white trader that deals in flesh, and they have to decide how much living is worth to them.

Bloody Mary is the story based on folklore. It takes place in a nice medical facility and, after asking Boody Mary in, someone disappears. Then others start to go, then others, then fear sets in. Never trust the other side of the mirror - it isn't nice like the other sid eof the pillow.

Wages of sin is a ghost story that ties into an inheritance tale. A woman gets a home and decides to check it out, only to find out it fits her more comfortably than a glove. In fact, the fit seems to make her see things, and the things are madness, pointing to a death that happened here. Can this beremedied, is it madness, or is it all something else?

Skeleton Man is one of those things where you find out that messing with the dead is bad news. You see the people doing it in the Indian Burial ground, yell no, and yet they dig. Then the S.M. appears, killing and having its way.

Live Animals, bloody Many, Wages of Sin, Skeleton Man are the films and i hope this all helps. Thank you.",1297468800,6,1833,4.008219178082192
3959171,5,B002NALPFY,"This collection is worth the purchase just for ""Salvage"" alone.  That truly has one of the best storylines, and one of the most surprise endings, I had ever seen.  It's not only my favorite Indie movie, but in my top 20 of all-time films.

The other 3 are noteworthy, and for the price, you cannot beat this!",1295568000,,308,4.368421052631579
8374889,3,B002NALPFY,"KRAKEN

Released to TV in 2006, ""Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep"" chronicles the adventures of an expedition led by archaeologist Nicole (Victoria Pratt) to find a legendary Greek Opal, which turns out to be guarded by the very beast that murdered one of the team member's parents (Charlie O'Connell), a giant squid. As they come face to face with the creature they are forced to tangle with a ruthless treasure-hunting mobster (Jack Scalia), who will stop at nothing to steal the treasure.

While the BC locations are great and the squid looks pretty good for low-budget CGI, the acting of the protagonists is too flat and the villain is overly cartoony. Fitness model Pratt comes off as a more buff Kate Hudson, but doesn't do much for me. Michal Yannai as Sally is equally blas. The stunning Nicole McKay is on hand as the heavy's babe for all of 20 seconds. I realize a lot of work went into making this movie and it's worthwhile if you favor Pratt, O'Connell or sea monster flicks, but it's just overall too prosaic.

The movie runs almost 90 minutes and was shot in Britannia Beach, Squamish & Vancouver, British Columbia.

GRADE: C-

HOWLING IV: THE ORIGINAL NIGHTMARE

Released in 1988, ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" chronicles events in the Southern Cal desert town of Drago, where a writer (Romy Windsor) goes to heal after a mental breakdown, which is hard to do when she gets caught up in a mystery about demons and werewolves. Michael T. Weiss plays her husband while Antony Hamilton plays her hunky friend from Los Angeles. Susanne Severeid appears as a fan of the writer who becomes her assistant sleuth while Norman Anstey in on hand as the aloof sheriff. Lamya Derval plays a shop-owner with cat-like eyes and torpedo breasts (sorry).

The movie's subtitled ""The Original Nightmare"" because it's more faithful to Gary Brandner's original novel, which doesn't mean it's better, not even close. The low-budget prevents it from being anything more than a decent sequel with a rushed, awkward ending. Unlike the classic ""The Howling"" (1981), werewolves are scarce, but it's superior to ""Howling II"" (1985) and ""Howling III"" (1987) in that it throws out Phillippe Mora's goofy camp and general eccentricities.

I like the slow-build mystery and the cast. There's some quality full moon ambiance as well and Windsor & Severeid make for an effective female team. Moreover, Weiss is one of the few actors who could get away with a mullet. While the bulk of the movie was shot in the sticks of South Africa, and you can tell, it's not THAT bad of a substitute for the desert wilderness of Southern Cal. Actually, it makes for an interesting change of pace for the barely-connected series of stand-alone werewolf flicks.

The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in South Africa with some parts in Fresno & Los Angeles, California. It was directed by John Hough from a script by Clive Turner and Freddie Rowe. Clive would continue serious work with the franchise on 1989's ""Howling V: The Rebirth"" and 1995's ""Howling: New Moon Rising.""

GRADE: C+

====================

NIGHT SHADOW

RELEASED IN 1989 and written/directed by Randolph Cohlan, ""Night Shadow"" (originally titled ""Lycanthrope"") concerns a humble Los Angeles newscaster (Brenda Vance) who returns to her home town on vacation as several people crop up dead, as if by a vicious animal. Alta LaFlame plays the sheriff, Rick Scott a mysterious hitchhiker, Stuart Quan the protagonist's kung fuey brother and Kato Kaelin his friend.

This is akin to a modern Syfy creature feature, but with a production quality a notch below that prosaic level. The serviceable score, for instance, sounds like it was performed entirely on a Casio keyboard (and no doubt it was). There's also too much marking time. Still, the cast is likable, the small town setting is quaint and the monster is pretty effective for a man in a suit, but you have to wait till the final act to see him.

Vance is a more-than-agreeable protagonist, but the film drops the ball in the female department, as far as taking advantage of the resources (and I'm not tawkin' 'bout nudity or sleaze). But there's a lot of martial arts action due to the presence of Quan; and the late 80's ambiance is to die for (take, for instance, Quan's absurd bra-like billie shirt and Kato's hideous mullet).

THE FILM RUNS 91 minutes and was shot in Hanford & Fresno in the heart of California.

GRADE: C

RAGING SHARKS

RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2005 and directed by Danny Lerner, Raging Sharks concerns an extraterrestrial object that crash-lands in the Bermuda Triangle, which releases an alien substance that causes sharks to go crazy and attack an oceanic observatory station, beach goers and anyone else nearby. Corin Nemec plays the leader of the station and Vanessa Angel his wife, who runs the station in his absence. Corbin Bernsen appears as a wise sub commander and Todd Jensen a dubious government agent.

This aint your typical Jaws-copy shark flick; the plots way more ambitious. In fact, theres well over two hours of material here crammed into an hour and a half. The production quality is akin to the usual Syfy fare but with a lot of cussing, which shows that it was released to video rather than TV.

The creators mustve been targeting 12-14 year-old boys because theres zero character development or suspense build-up. Something exciting happens every couple minutes, whether a shark attack, an explosion, a compartment flooded, someone getting knifed, shot, drowned, etc. Despite the continuous thrilling events to appease those with ADHD the first hour is relatively boring with zero artistic tact. Imagine if Conan the Barbarian knew how to play guitar and crudely tried to play the moving classic Stairway to Heaven. Thats a good description of this movie as it freely borrows from several sci-fi and shark films to barbarically fashion its own adolescent action flick.

Thankfully, the last act finally delivers some genuine excitement and suspense, which is the main reason my grade is as high as it is. Plus Elise Muller as Vera is showcased effectively in a couple of scenes, but they couldve done a lot better considering the female resources at their disposal. So, this is a bad movie, but the final act is impressively kinetic and entertaining, as far as action-oriented sci-fi goes. Too bad its such a challenge to make it that far.

THE MOVIE RUNS 93 minutes and was shot in Sofia, Bulgaria. WRITER: Les Weldon.
