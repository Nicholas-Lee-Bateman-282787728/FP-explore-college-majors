172243,5,0941283186,"Within the opening frames of this relaxing but engrossing video, one is transported to both a new manner of teaching as well as just great basic instruction.  This video acts a great teaching tool for everyone from green  circle to double black diamond. You can review portions of the instruction  all season and learn excellent technique over and over again.",939340800,22,359,4.95
172244,5,0941283186,"I bought 1 st DVD, loved it so much.  I then bought 2nd DVD, loved it too. Then I just bought the 3 DVD and still love it so much. The techniques and methods of teaching in this DVD are very clear and easy to understand.  Worth the money.",1299888000,,238,3.836734693877551
172245,5,0941283186,It is a classic that you can view over and over again for reinforcement and never get tired of it.  I am planning to watch more before our Alta trip.,1297123200,,149,3.966666666666667
172246,5,0941283186,"I really love this DVD as well as the first one in the series.  I've had them for several years and I watch them so often I fear I'll wear them out.  While they were made in the late 1990's when the skiing style was a bit different, anyone can see that most of his principles transfer quite nicely into what skiers do now on the much wider skis.  Because in the first video he skis with skis close together doesn't mean the turning and practice principles are all that different.  And this 3rd video was obviously made when the new shaped, wider skis first arrived so you do see a bit of a change in how he skis.  I absorbed an incredible amount from both videos.

One thing that sets Lito's DVDs apart is the stunning photography, which is incredibly well filmed and head and shoulders above any other ski instruction video I've seen....and I've seen and bought quite a few.  On Lito's DVDs most of the skiing is shown at a slightly slowed down video speed so that you can easily observe exactly what he is demonstrating or explaining.  All the other videos I've seen from other instructors are shown at normal speed where people ski extremely fast, with the result that you can't really see exactly what they are doing.

When ski season starts each year, I begin watching these videos over and over, little bits of them before every ski day.  Then each time I ski, something inevitably pops into my head that I remember from the video....tips, techniques, practice drills...and I work on that particular thing.  I've also had a lot of ""ah-ha"" moments when I've figured something out that I realize came from a point I absorbed from one of Lito's videos.  I've taken lessons, but I can honestly say that cumulatively, I've learned far more from Litos #1 and #3 DVDs.  When I feel ready to do moguls, I'll get that video as well.  Some people may find it hard to believe that you could learn much about skiing from sitting and watching videos, but I completely disagree.  There are a lot of things to learn and absorb from each DVD, which is why it's useful to watch it a great many times.",1294704000,3,2089,4.4605263157894735
172247,4,0941283186,"I love the teaching technique and photography of Lito Tejada but this video is old - made in 1998.  Most of what is shown is relevant but the lifting of the ski ""concentrate on lifting the heal of the foot..."" is no longer recommended.  However, with that knowledge you can still learn a lot from this video and it is beautiful to watch.  Also recommend Harald Harb's book for more updated information. Lito's book on Soft Skiing for older skiers states that ""I just leave both skis on the snow"".  Wish Lito would put out a new DVD with his new techniques!",1294185600,,556,4.421568627450981

172249,5,0941283186,"The DVD was recorded with very stunning background.  The use of a perfect day with perfectly groomed slopes allowed you to focus on the lessons being taught.  After reviewing the DVD approximately 3 times, I then went out onto the slopes.  I began as a low intermediate.  By the end of approximately 3 hours I was able to comfortably, not expertly, handle single black diamond runs with choppy spring snow at Mountain High Ski Resort in California. I clearly still need practice but I am not afraid and now I actually look forward to these difficult runs.  Lito's techniques have given me the missing tools to improve my skiing and with practice I will become an expert!",1266796800,,670,4.6923076923076925
172250,4,0941283186,"This is a very inspiring video that discusses and shows carving techniques and how to ski with more ease. During a short skiing holiday shortly after purchase, the effects have been noticeable! More fun on skis with less effort!",1235520000,,228,4.871794871794871
172251,5,0941283186,"Okay...I'm not a fantastic skiier, but watching this dvd before skiing last year totally improved my skills. I wish I had seen this years ago before my bad habits began!!! Also, relaxing and beautiful, almost hypnotic. Buy it!",1225324800,2,226,4.973684210526316
172252,5,0941283186,"I watched all the video in the series. This is very similar to the first video in the series but instead of older skis he is using the new shaped skis that make carving and turning much easier. This is more of a recap of the previous videos but will also stand alone and be just as worthwhile as a teaching tool. You will get a lot of excellent information and be skiing better after just one viewing. The approach to skiing is very mellow, the scenery and music in the video are very beautiful and quite relaxing. The skills and techniques are amazingly simple to master and your skiing should improve considerably. When you hit the mountains you will incorporate the techniques from the video and be sking better from the get-go. It's an awesome feeling to gently glide down even the more difficult slopes.",1198886400,2,808,4.541095890410959

172254,5,0941283186,My wife and I have both improved our skiing technique and our enjoyment of skiing through the use of this DVD and the original breakthrough video. The lessons are clear and easy to follow. We watch the breakthough videos every season before we hit the slopes. Highly recommended.,1173830400,,279,4.833333333333333
172255,5,0941283186,"As this was filmed after the advent of shaped skis this is the best of Lito Tejada-Flores videos to buy.  His graceful moves down the slopes at Aspen will inspire you.

If you are trying to be a better intermediate skier watch this video every day and memorize the pictures.  Then when you go down the slopes think of Lito and his wife and try to emulate them.

Practise, watch, practise, watch, ... - over and over again.  Every time I watch it I see something new. I must have watched it at least 15 times and the words get a bit tedious - but I'm never bored with the skiing technique.

I'd get all three if you can afford it, but if you only get one, this is the most comprehensive and its not necessary to have the earlier videos to appreciate this one.",1169856000,9,758,4.1931034482758625
172256,5,0941283186,This DVD is excellent.  The points can be practiced and lead to clear improvement and more enjoyment of skiing.  The instruction is private lesson quality.  The author does not overwhelm you with details.  The lessons learned apply to all levels of skiing.  A great purchase for those looking to bump up from intermediate to expert but also really good for beginners and children,1169078400,6,379,4.9523809523809526
172257,4,0941283186,Great tips for intermediate level.  I wish I would have seen it last year before I twisted by leg - I might hv avoided it and hv more fun.,1168560000,,138,3.7586206896551726
172258,2,0941283186,"""Breakthrough"" was one of two ""media"" purchases I made to improve my skiing ability. As ""Breakthrough"" is sold in DVD format, it presented itself as an attractive purchase. Unfortunately I did not find the presentation and material particularly helpful.

As a result, I then purchased the ""Essentials of Skiing"", a book by Harald Harb and found it fully instructed me on the fundamentals of successful skiing.

In conclusion, although the DVD appeared attractive, the essence of improving

my skiing lay in the pages of Harald Harb's book.",1168300800,6,539,5.172413793103448
172259,4,0941283186,"I've been skiing now for nearly 10 years and during this time I've had many ski instructors with different styles of teaching but nothing compares to the information prodived by this DVD. Lito goes straight to the point and tells you exactly what you need to know from early weight shift to correct body position for the various runs from easy blues to serious off piste.

Within a day or two of practicing his techniques I found myself carving more arcs and in more control of my skis. Which face it, is the real reason we all wanted to ski in the first place. Not only am I in more control but for once I feel like I am progressing out of the intermediate rut. This DVD gives lots of freeze frames and easy to understand instruction which you can practice the minute you hit the slopes.

I found the DVD so useful I ended up buying his book as well which gives you even more insight into the different techniques from small radius arcs to mogul runs. Thus I had to go for another ski holiday which I've just returned from and boy does this book complement the DVD. I'm more of a visual learner myself and reckoned that the book wouldn't add any more additional information but I can safely say that I was wrong.

The total running time for this DVD is just under 60 mins and he does repeat himself alot but this just proves to concrete how important some of the core aspects of his ski technique are.

Anyway I highly recommend this DVD and believe me you won't be dissappointed!",1142553600,15,1481,4.355072463768116
172260,4,0941283186,"This video was a good length, and ad lots of helpful demos & info for an intermediate skier like me. I would recommend it.",1137369600,2,122,4.125

172262,4,0941283186,"Seems a little weak compared to Lito's first 2 videos. This one basically says that the skills from previous videos are still good for the ""new"" shaped skis (well of course).

However the first two did not have this new school skiing demonstration. If you like to complete your collection, go for it by all means.",1113264000,9,313,4.589285714285714
172263,1,0941283186,"I bought this video first and found the first five minutes of the video useful. But then I got got the first of the series and found it to be just incredible (I will be rating that video five stars). This video is first of all...boring. I almost fell asleep drinking a glass of wine about halfway through. I just found this video to be a mapping of the techniques in I & II to the shaped skiis. Basically, the techniques Tito speaks of don't change from I & II but he stresses that the shaped ski is more responsive than the older skiis. Don't waste your money on this one. I recommend the first in the series if you want to ski the groomed slopes and the second for bumps and powder.",1039564800,24,684,4.150375939849624

7793521,2,0941283186,"The video (with the exception of racers' runs) teaches all the bad habits - skis together, inner hand pulled inside, rotating the arms, often with balance point behind, lifting the inner leg completely.
He talks about perfect carving turn in slo-mo while actually not showing a single nice carving turn without sliding.
This video is ancient - those ""new"" shaped skis are actually carving skis which have been the standard shape for the last 15 years.
The only valuable thing are the videos of racers skiing (luckily they don't follow the instructions tought in this video) and skiing the moguls.",1451088000,,596,4.97

7793523,5,0941283186,"I have purchased all three of the Breakthough On Skis videos.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each one of them.  The instructional dialogue was clear and concise, matching the accompanying video segments.  I started with the ""Breakthrough On Skis II and utilized this during the ski season.  My ability and confidence levels increased considerably. I then purchased the first video and subsequently the third.  I am looking forward to the next ski season with anticipation.  As a ""baby boomer,"" I feel that the lessons presented in this series are extremely useful.
