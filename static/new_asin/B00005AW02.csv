1418723,5,B00005AW02,Good  movie.  All  the  actors  were  good.,1404691200,,43,4.428571428571429
1418724,5,B00005AW02,"I loved A Texas Funeral!  The actresses/actors are great!  The music score is great!  The storyline is great!  And the family.......well, they aren't a Brady Bunch family and I loved the Whitt's because of that fact. They all come together for a funeral and their flaws and secrets are revealed.

There are some tear jerker moments in this movie as well as some humorous ones too.  In particular, the scene where one male family member tells another of how he became a man.  I laughed out loud at how it was told!

Little Sparta and the camel!  The awesome power of the Whitt ear!  Big Sparta's secret!

You have to see this movie! It's one I won't forget for a long time.",1357171200,7,672,4.426229508196721
1418725,5,B00005AW02,"I just finished watching this movie (which I never heard of until I picked it up in a cheap Walmart bin) and I was so impressed that I rushed to my p.c. to write this review.

Watch it. You will not be disappointed. The direction, photography and music are well done, and the actors perform beautifully.

But the writing by W. Blake Herron is transcendent. The script is filled with lust, shame, flawed ancestors' ghosts, present challenges, and with hope for the future.

Mr. Herron's poetical script touches on the profound, again and again.",1298851200,7,543,4.75531914893617
1418726,5,B00005AW02,"This is a modern-day Texas  western.
 If you want to watch an excellent story of family life in a most unusual family in Texas,this will certainly fit the bill.
 I had never heard of this film before. It is called a western adventure ,but is hardly typical of a western with,cattle ranches,gunfights,horses,and such. It has a well thought out storyline that keeps your attention from start to finish. The performances by Chris North,Robert Patrick,Martin Sheen Isaiah Washington,Joanne Whalley and others are all excellent and the characters they portray are all interesting, though be it,very unusual.
If you like westerns,and particularly life ,Texaz style,I strongly recommend it. Though I found it a very different type of movie and story;I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to rewatch it as I feel there is a lot more to this movie than first appears and I am sure I'll find much more from a second watch.",1251849600,4,907,4.953947368421052
1418727,5,B00005AW02,"My family is from Texas, and I thought that we were dysfunctional!!!  Ha! Ha!  This film is so real--good people and bad people and crazy people, but always love.",1250294400,4,162,4.551724137931035
1418728,4,B00005AW02,"Ok, I admit it.  While most kids grew up sucking their thumbs, I was more interested in the ear.  It had a soothing quality that would put me to sleep.  Needless to say, when I read that this family had an ear fetish, I just had to see what this was all about.  No, this movie is not just about sucking an earlobe that belongs to your husband's corpse, though I was laughing so hard during this scene, nor is it just another film trying to come across as artsy with an overdose of weirdness that just cannot seem to blend well.  Instead we are presented with a rather strange and different story of a family and their haunting secrets.  It captures a well deserved four stars.
What was supposed to be a family reunion for the reading of the will, due to Jeremiah Sparta's (Martin Sheen)death, turns out to be a weekend that reveals just how little they all knew about each other.  Seen mostly through the eyes of Jeremiah's grandson, who decides to be mute after being told to shut up, we see him interact with Jeremiah and his ancestors in the spirit world.  They unload all the juicy tales of the past and it's quite fun to hear all the live folks' interpretation.  After the will is read, this sets the stage for everyone's personal struggle with their haunting secrets.  With solid performances and an engrossing script, you can't help but be drawn into everyone's life as you see all the anger, pain, jealousy and even an unquenchable fetish dissolve.
Definitely a keeper.  One you could watch again.  Good sound and picture quality too.",1067558400,17,1542,4.527075812274369
1418729,4,B00005AW02,"A wonderful film, by a talented (new?) writer/director.  A well crafted, intimate portrait of an old Texas family, it's history, and the ghosts (literally & metaphorically) in the family closet.
Fine performances all around.  M. Sheem & Robert Patrick are SOLID.
Refreshing change from the slick, impersonable films from hollywood these days.
I look forward to future films by B. Herron.",1002758400,9,387,5.327868852459017

1418751,5,B00005AW02,"I had never heard of this moving until today.  I thought it was a great movie...quirky, well-written, and very well acted.  I'm from Texas, so some of the dialogue concerning racists comments and religious radicalism was on target.  Unfortunately, it is again part of the Texas culture with Confederate flags and overt racism rearing it's ugly head, again.

1418782,3,B00005AW02,"I enjoyed this movie and thought the acting and storyline were ""pretty okay"". Characters were interesting and sufficiently developed. The film is, of course, an all-out vicious attack on conservative values generally and Southern culture in particular--but we're used to that. Nevertheless, the film was entertaining because the caricature of Southerners was so grossly distorted and misrepresented as to be amusing. This ""nice try"" at insulting us conservative-leaning folks failed, once again, IMO, and resulted in a reasonably funny parody.  I wouldn't watch it again, but I found a number of laughs the first time around and understood it to be a ""roasting"" so it was all good fun. If you've nothing else to do on a Sunday afternoon, it's worth watching, if only to see what the South is not like at all. And to Texans everywhere, a great big God Bless Texas from this Florida girl. :)",1500768000,2,889,4.966442953020135

1418801,3,B00005AW02,"Not a movie I'd watch twice...

Basic story is of a patriarch passing away...and coming ""back"" in visions to help the grandson deal with the loss and help him become a ""man"" so to speak.  I found it to be a little over acted...and the writing and plot thin.  I wouldn't really classify this as a comedy...although there were amusing parts.  To me, there were too many subplots...and in the end, they didn't really bring the cast together.  While the actors weren't bad...I didn't think they connected well.

For me, this is a background movie for a boring evening...when you can't find anything better to watch.",1499472000,,611,4.716981132075472
1418802,4,B00005AW02,I enjoyed.,1486252800,,10,4.5
1418803,5,B00005AW02,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It's an original plot with a touch of surrealism.

All the characters were well acted by the actors, each one giving the character a shady past that comes out in the end.  The characters develop as the plot unfolds, with a few pleasant twists thrown in.  Setting, lighting and pace are well-timed.

Martin Sheen plays the deceased grandfather Sparta. He led quite a colorful, controversial life.  The family gathers together on the Texas ranch to prepare for the funeral and the reading of the will, during which the truth about the past comes out.  Everyone harbors a little secret that they learn to deal with.  Everyone can be seen as crazy and not living in reality. There really is no bad guy in this film, which makes every character believable and likeable.  For me Isiah Washington's role as  Walter was the most influential, but one sees that only slowly. He's the only one who never tells a tall tale, a tall tale that grows into a lingering lie that morphed into the truth.

There's a message in this well-acted film and that is that blood, that family is stronger than money and oil.  There is a nice ending to this fable that must be savored.  If you like action and little dialogue, this movie will disappoint.  If you like original scripts and storylines, this will delight.",1483056000,2,1332,4.660944206008583

1418861,2,B00005AW02,"Having grown up in small-town Texas, I have an affinity for films set in mostly rural locales of the Lone Star State. The landscape and the people make for unique stories, specific to the region. However, this ambitious, well-cast effort failed to take advantage of those elements and offers up a mishmash full of weird shifting tones and forced comic moments. My biggest problem with the film is that we're supposed to believe that deceased patriarch of the family (Martin Sheen) is a role model for his nervous, nearly mute grandson. PLOT SPOILER: Sheen's character spends most of the film, dispensing life lessons from the grave, to his grandson. And this is a grandfather who, years before, killed his handy man--shooting him in the back as he flees over a misunderstanding. Like I said, weird.",1434412800,2,798,4.9185185185185185

1418906,3,B00005AW02,"This could have been an excellent film. Great acting, very well made and wonderfully quirky story, however they milked some of the quirkiness far too much. It is like they were trying to hit a nerve that wasn't there and came across as silliness and unconvincing.",1421107200,,263,4.739130434782608

1418910,2,B00005AW02,"I got bored watching it and had to stop about half way through.
I found myself wanting to watch something else.
It has an inverted time line so you know what happened ahead time and then it fills in the blanks.
There are some good actors.
However, I got tired of the plot and all the flashbacks.",1419984000,,295,4.192982456140351
1418911,5,B00005AW02,"Interesting characters, wonderful ending!",1418688000,,41,9.5
1418922,1,B00005AW02,"CONS: Sorry. I just didn't like this movie at all. I found it odd and most of all, none of the characters were likable. I couldn't locate the humor either. I rechecked a couple times to see if it was really listed under comedy. I didn't feel there was any richness or depth. No growth in the characters. Just a bunch of weird characters doing weird stuff. And the ending was corny. The ending also seemed contrived. I liked it better when the kid didn't talk.

PROS: Now the camel was very good though. He showed anger, grief and gentleness. I hadn't seen this camel act before, but I'm betting the camel will have a promising career. It was probably one of the best camel performances I've seen since Lawrence of Arabia. Definitely the only character in the movie I liked. Possibly up for best supporting camel.",1417996800,2,812,4.523809523809524

1418926,5,B00005AW02,"This is an authentic portrait of some folks whose roots and lives are bigger than the silver screen.  I am happy to say my family tree was watered in the blood shed at San Jacinto against Santa Anna!  I was reminded of Lyndon Johnson's ranch on the Perdanales in the Hill Country, which I was privileged to see back about 20 years ago!  This is a sweet movie with some poignant and well acted and written scenes of one boy's recollections of his family and childhood when his Paw-Paw dies!",1416528000,2,489,4.411111111111111
1418927,4,B00005AW02,"Missed this movie when it first came out and glad that I caught it here.  It's an intriguing cast of diverse characters that kept me waiting to see what each one was going to do next.  Great acting, photograply and story-telling.  It's a step above the usual mo;vie drivel you run across and the whole thing slowly grabbed me up from the beginning. I highly recommend it",1416441600,3,370,4.492537313432836

7935932,2,B00005AW02,"Eh. Very odd, not-engaging film with two actors who are pretty accomplished - Chris Both and Martin Sheen.

Grandpa is dead and his family gathers for the funeral. The rest of the film is simply weird.  This is coming from an old (past retirement aged) woman with a disabilities whose favorite film is Apocalypse Now Redux. I know weird. Look up old Law & Order, Sex and the City, The West Wing, Grace & Frankie TV shows. Then find Badlands and The Way for Sheen films. You'll be much happier.",1508716800,,493,4.466666666666667
7935933,1,B00005AW02,Extremely boring and stupid. This is not a comedy. Just a drama that really drags on. I turned it off after 30 minutes. I can't believe an accomplished actor like Martin Sheen would do a movie like this.,1503705600,,203,4.368421052631579

7935935,5,B00005AW02,"Great feel good movie about family, friends, and yes, a funeral.  I recommend taking the time to watch this movie.  It is a mixed bag of a child coming of age, family secrets, taking care of each other, dealing with death, and forgiveness. It is funny, sad, and even has a touch of romance.",1502582400,,290,4.351851851851852
7935936,2,B00005AW02,"This movie mistakes quirkiness of characters with excellence. You might be taken in by it in the beginning, but it gets tiring fast because there simply isn't anything beyond any character but the quirkiness. I watched until about 45 minutes until the end and then just gave up the ghost. Somebody tells me how it ends because I sure as hell ain't gonna watch it, and I'm from Texas, y'all!",1502323200,,390,4.585714285714285

7935938,2,B00005AW02,"Wasted opportunity due to shallow characterizations that spend so much time trying to force stereotypicality over dimensionality. It has moments when, if only the actors could feel any depth-of-humanity toward their own characters, the movie might have been great. This obvious shortcoming meant I didn't feel up to enduring the last part of the flick; it just wasn't engaging enough to be worthy of watching.",1502236800,,409,5.3076923076923075
7935939,3,B00005AW02,"Could have been a great movie, but the writer(s) and director tried waaaay too hard to achieve a quirky, eccentric but lovable family that somehow exemplifies the checkered uniqueness of Texas.  And it didn't work.  Just came across as a very self-conscious movie, and not very true to what Texas is really like.  And I say that as a fifth-generation, native-born Texan.",1502236800,2,370,4.935483870967742
