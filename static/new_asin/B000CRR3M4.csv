2471921,2,B000CRR3M4,"O.K., for an ultra-low budget film the clown makeup of the character Shivers was good and the lighting was done well but that's about it.  The story was really dull and allthough you had some really promising scenes the payoff was always lackluster.  The thing that really ruined this film for me was the stupidity of it.  As the clown attacks his victims none of them screem and as the clown walks over to them they just stand there staring at him.  There's a scene when a police officer handcuffs the wrong clown, now this all happens in broad daylight and in a residential neighborhood, Shivers comes from behind the cop with a big ax and cuts of his head(It looked really cheezy), Shivers walks away and the handcuffed clown on the ground never once screems or even tries to get up and run.  I wanted to like this movie but it was just too dum, but I think with a little more practice Kevin Kangas could become a good director, just have someone help you write the next script, please.",1141948800,2,989,4.441988950276243
2471922,1,B000CRR3M4,"I just finished watching this movie on DVD. I couldn't wait to review it so I could give it a 1 star rating! Geez.... what a cheap movie with horrible acting, poor filming, low budget and a silly plot!!!! How misleading the box to this movie was. I can sum the movie up very simply: a woman who paints clowns is going through a divorce, suddenly she starts having visions of one of the clowns she has painted. Oh, and get this..... she has a fear of clowns!!! Anyway, when murders begin happening to people who are close to her, she suspects the clown is the killer. We do see the killer clown throughout the movie. I do have to say that I said ""cool"" to 4 short scenes in this movie only because they were very short bloody killing scenes. Oh, and the ending....... one of the stupidest endings I've ever seen in a movie. If there is a Fear of Clowns part 2 in the works, here is someone who won't be watching it!  PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JOKE OF A MOVIE!!!!!!",1141430400,4,975,4.213903743315508
2471923,4,B000CRR3M4,"Kevin Kangas's 'FEAR OF CLOWNS' is not only one of the very best ultra low-budget slasher films ever made it's also right up there with Victor Salva's 'CLOWNHOUSE' as one of the best of the psycho-clown horror flicks.  Much respect to actor Mark Lassise who shoulders this film as Shiver's The Clown,one of the most visually frightning additions to the list of great horror villains. Although the film has its flaws it always seems to redeem itself with a brilliant horror sequence that makes you forget about any minor budget issues(like bad acting!). 'FEAR OF CLOWNS' is an excellent new horror film & Kevin Kangas is a Director that horror fans should watch out for!  UPDATE: the numbskull bad reviewer's on this page are NOT fans of ultra low-budget horror so there opinions are useless BUT if your are a fan then after you view this film you will see what all the hype is about!",1141171200,4,883,4.653846153846154
2471924,5,B000CRR3M4,"I was looking forward to this movie since 2003, I finally got to see it in May of 2005. Let me say I was NOT disappointed! This movie is freakin' AWESOME. The acting is uneven at times (some of the actors are REALLY good, some of them seem to have flunked out of elementary school drama class), but the story is original, and solid, not to mention the effects are great considering the budget. You MUST purchase this film, if you don't Shivers the Clown, may target you next!",1137196800,5,475,4.348314606741573
2471925,1,B000CRR3M4,"I have to agree. I got to see this movie and it's equally terrible sequel for free as I worked with a guy who knows Kangas and worked on both movies in a small way. Pull out the thesaurus entries for horrible and godawful for both!  Not even the 5 second gratuitous nudity helped this one...bad writing, bad acting...just bad.  The Plan 9 from Outer Space of killer clown movies, without any of Plan 9's redeeming factors...oh wait, that didn't have any either.  They're just lucky the MST3K guys had already packed it in when this came out....perfect fodder for Mike and the bots.",1271980800,,581,4.5673076923076925
2471926,1,B000CRR3M4,"Just watched this horrible flick last night and after watching it, I think the budget for this movie was $1.29.  I did not enjoy a single actor or actress in this movie whatsoever.  It seemed to me they were porn stars pulled right out of a porn set to film this.  Great idea for a flick but the bad acting ruined it for me.  I couldn't wait for it to end, really.",1246406400,,364,4.013888888888889
2471927,1,B000CRR3M4,This was one of the worst movies I'v ever bought through amazon. Low budgeted and BOOOORING.,1210982400,4,92,4.8125
2471928,1,B000CRR3M4,THE GIRL IN THE MOVIE WAS CUTE.. THE ACTING SUCKED AND THE STORY LINE WAS TERRIBLE.. AND THERES A 2ND MOVIE.. I THINK I WILL SAVE MY MONEY,1207612800,4,138,3.9642857142857144
2471929,1,B000CRR3M4,"Ok, this movie....horribly boring!  Death scenes are not exciting or gory!  The make-up on the face of the ""clown"" was the only cool thing.  What was he trying to be, a clown who escaped from a male strip club?  For god's sakes, why shirtless?  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!",1204502400,6,269,4.520833333333333
2471930,5,B000CRR3M4,"I almost feel as if I have to apologize for giving this movie 5 stars. Clowns are one of my biggest fears, and when I saw this on the shelf I had to rent it. I loved it! It scared me silly, when so many horror movies recently have barely made me cringe. Yes, it's a B or idependant film, and some of the characters, especially Lynn, I would have like more in depth character development. But come on! This is a crazy clown who stalks and murders with an axe! I bought this movie and have watched it several times, and I can't wait to watch part 2 when it's released.",1186099200,2,566,4.0625
2471931,1,B000CRR3M4,"It deserves ZERO stars! This thing was hyped to death and like most horror fans I anticipated the release of Fear of Clowns. Okay, I know B-movies can be fun, like Killer Klowns from Outer Space. But that movie was supposed to be silly. This film was trying to be scary!! What??!! I'm all for laughs with a good cheesy horror flick on a weekend but you have to draw the line somewhere. This was a waste of my time as well as the director and the dreadful actors. I hope I never see those people again in anything! I thought Shivers had potential but the whole concept was totally wasted. The storyline didn't make a lick of sense and nothing was believable or frightening at all. And how about that technicolor blood? I thought we've outgrown that since the 60's and 70's! There is nothing fun or scary about this piece of crap whatsoever, and it totally mocks what indie horror should be. Either you're a spoof or you're not. Make up your mind before you make it people! This is a huge let down! I dozed several times during it and prayed for it all to be over. Please ignore this when you stop by the video store. The case and all of it's 4 star ratings are deceiving. Fear of Clowns is nothing to be afraid of.",1181952000,3,1213,4.278260869565218
2471932,1,B000CRR3M4,"I'm not a big fan of clown movies, but my friend rented this film for a ""scary movie night"" (lame, yes). Five minutes into the movie, my friends and I started laughing hysterically at the incredibly bad acting in this film. This is by far (and without exaggeration) the worst movie I have ever seen. I couldn't even watch the entire thing because it was incredibly stupid. Terrible, terrible acting and a horrible plot.

Do not purchase this movie unless you're looking for a good laugh. Actually, just don't purchase the movie at all.",1156896000,4,535,4.691489361702128
2471933,2,B000CRR3M4,"Order pizza/invite your most sarcastic wise cracking friends over/laugh your arses off. This movie was very very bad. Wooden acting with plot holes a mile wide and a ridiculous deranged ""monster"" who is neither scary nor believable. There's juvenile gratuitous nudity and lots of blood. Awful but still recommended for a good chuckle.",1154908800,9,334,5.320754716981132
2471934,2,B000CRR3M4,I love horror movies and i am afraid of clowns so i thought this movie would be really good.  so i rented it with my money and boy was i dissapointed.  The acting sucked you don't see anyone being killed (well you sorta do) but don't waste your time with this unless you like to waste it!,1150502400,3,288,4.035087719298246
2471935,1,B000CRR3M4,"This movie was just dreadful. From it's turtle pace and horrible acting, to the ill-concieved notion that a half naked, muscular man in clown makeup is frightening. Nothing worked in this film. There are so many fantastic indie horror films out there, please save your dollars and pick something else as ""Fear of Clowns"" is just a bottom of the barrel horror film.",1149724800,4,364,4.7936507936507935
2471936,1,B000CRR3M4,"Jacky Reres plays a painter woman who's assigned to paint a picture of a grandfather of some guy and he'll give her lots of money if she does it right for him. She meets Rick Ganz (Life 101, Hunting Humans) at an art gallery and they hit it off nicely in which they become more and more closer to each other until she finds magazines in his place with articles on her and what not. Meanwhile a sadistic dude named Shivers The Clown played by Mark Lassise (Vampire Sisters, The Watcher) is after her killing people left and right, flexing his muscles whilst swinging his axe. It is an Indie Horror movie but it's bad. Sorry for the lame summary (forgot names) but still this movie is beyond boring.  Shivers is trying to be scary when in actuality he looks dumb, retarded and to add it all on a not so good actor is playing him. Kevin Kangas is a horrible screenplay writer....bad dialouge down the middle man, sorry buddy. Skip this and watch Jeepers Creepers or something. I said my words and I'm sticking to them",1149120000,4,1014,4.422459893048129
2471937,1,B000CRR3M4,"I am a huge indie horror fan and I must say that film was a sad piece of work. The script... well I'm not sure there was one. I have seen trees act better than these actors... On the cover of this the quotes say ""Freighting"" (they must be talking about the dialogue) and ""Intense"" (I couldn't wait for the film to end, so that was kinda intense).

I saw a review that said Shivers the clown will be an icon such as Freddy or Jason... The only way this will happen is if Shivers dies and is reincarnated as Freddy or Jason.

I gave it one star for using a mini Jib and Dolly and for at least pointing the camera in the right direction.

Horrible film unless you love extremely long, slow, drug out scenes with no pay off. There was more blood shed in Fraggle Rock.",1147219200,3,763,4.10738255033557
2471938,5,B000CRR3M4,"I wonder what movie some of these reviewers watched, because it certainly wasn't Fear Of Clowns from Kevin Kangas!  I also wonder how many of these reviewers have ever watched Indie horror before?  I could write a doctorate's thesis on some of the ignorant comments made on here, usually by people who are knocking the film.  But why  waste the time on these people?

Fear Of Clowns is an intense and disturbing film from a promising filmmaker.  Shivers is one of the most original bad guys to have graced the screen in a long time. And, this movie has something for everyone.",1145404800,7,576,4.598039215686274

It's ok , to watch & than forget & watch a real horror .. movies, about clowns ""ClownHouse"" or even the movie ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"". Yes!..Tobe Hooper ""The Funhouse"" just to have fun .. with a good horror movie. Where my ""Dawn Of The Dead"" ....",1145145600,,316,4.112903225806452
2471940,5,B000CRR3M4,"I've read the online reviews--going into this thinking its the second coming of IT you are gonna be disappointed. If you like B-movie stuff though I think you'll have a good time.

Shivers is gonna be a new horror icon someday like Freddy and Jason. He is SCARY.

Other acting is a little uneven--the lead actress is good, while the Bruce Campbell look alike detective tries too hard to be over the top. By the end of the movie he is a little more tolerant though.

If you like B-movie horror and clowns scare you then check it out!",1144108800,6,532,4.353535353535354
2471941,1,B000CRR3M4,"This is a great movie if you find humor in horrible acting, lousy plot, and bad editing. A one star rating is being kind. If your considering buying or renting this one. Do yourself a favor and don't.",1143158400,4,200,4.2894736842105265

2471943,1,B000CRR3M4,"WOW! I have always been a little frightened of clowns myself, which is why I wanted to see this movie. Mercifully, I'm not afraid of wretched acting or I would have had a massive coronary. Simply put, this movie makes little to no sense and if you want gore, go to a store and squeeze some ketchup on a mannequin(since that's what the effects people did).",1142899200,5,355,4.393939393939394

8101293,1,B000CRR3M4,"There really is a dearth of clown horror films. I had high hopes for this. But, it is an amateur production without a story line. The director simply wanted to make a slasher horror film with a clown theme. He essentially says this in the Extras [The making of Fear of Clowns]. It is not enough to have a ""general idea"" to make a coherent film. Yes, I agree with the director that there really are not too many clown horror films. It's a good niche, if you can develop a good idea. This director claims to like horror films -- but, he can only cite the famous ""slasher""  horror films (Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc.) as his inspirations. Let's put a clown mask on Micheal Meyers, and call it a day! Very original. Let's be clear: originality is not this director's forte. If you want to see a guy in clown makeup kill people with an ax, for no apparent reason, and without any interruptions by nosy neighbors or police, then this is what you will get. It ain't interesting.

No, this film is not worth watching. I wish I could give it 2 star rating -- but, there really is nothing to see here. All the acting was strictly amateurish EXCEPT for the lead character (Jacqelen Reres), who was excellent. She actually is a good actor. The other lead (Rick Ganz) was satisfactory, but his character was not developed and the script was bad.",1515283200,,1336,4.426829268292683
