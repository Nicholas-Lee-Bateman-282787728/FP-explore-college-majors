7962130,4,B000066C70,"Quality of DVD was poor and looked old, but I went from a bad golfer to an ok golfer. Once you learn and practice the grip method a beginner golfer will hit long and straight. Thank you Bob Mann.",1434844800,,195,4.0256410256410255

7962135,1,B000066C70,"The  disc would not play. There was no regional code information on the package, so I don't know if it was a wrong code or just a bad disc.  Amazon refunded my purchase, however, without me having to return the package.  I might add that this was the first problem I've had.  All other purchases have been fine.",1364256000,,311,4.310344827586207

Now have a DVD player so I needed a new copy.  This DVD is my top instructional video.  It is the GOTO reference for me.",1363824000,2,277,4.150943396226415

First time I tried watching it literally put me to sleep, the second time around I watched standing up with clubs nearby and a Cappuccino. If you like vintage this will be easy, otherwise hit the coffee first!",1315872000,,325,4.52542372881356
7962138,5,B000066C70,"Bob Mann's original program was on tape and I had them.  These DVDs in my opinion are the best instructional videos on the market bar none and I am amazed at the low price.  I have videos by Butch Harmon and David Ledbettor and others,most of which are very good but are also a lot more expensive. When Bob Mann talks about an automatic golf swing you can take it to the bank.",1264550400,5,376,4.136986301369863
