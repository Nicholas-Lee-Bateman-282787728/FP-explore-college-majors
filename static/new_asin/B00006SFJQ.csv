7973173,5,B00006SFJQ,"You go into a special concert at the House of Blues in LA and you follow them at for interviews.  Plus you get the making of ""Why I Love You"" and how it was made.  I loved it!",1129939200,3,175,3.5789473684210527

7973175,5,B00006SFJQ,"This dvd is hot. if you have never went to any of their concerts you need to buy this dvd. b2K will keep you rolling all day.
I have seen this dvd about 1,000 times maybe even more. that's my advice to ya'll so go cop that.",1068595200,2,223,3.765957446808511
7973176,5,B00006SFJQ,"If your a B2K fan, this is a must have. Not only do you get live performaces from the boys, you get to know each member a little better. This DVD also has the making of ""Why I love you"", the video for ""Why I love you"", 4 hidden moments with B2K you have to find on the DVD, and more.
I personally have watched this DVD at least 30 times since I got it a little over a month ago. It's very entertaining, and I'm constantly laughing. I love it. It's probably the best DVD I have. Don't forget to get B2K's first DVD Single ""Introducing B2K"" as well.",1040947200,13,547,3.981818181818182
7973177,5,B00006SFJQ,"First of all, before I tell you about the DVD don't forget December 10,2002 B2K NEW Album ""Pandemonuim!"" in stores!
Okay this DVD is HOTT! If you have B2K's First DVD,Well... Lets just say ""Introducing:B2K"" has absolutely NOTHING on ""B2K:Live At The House Of Blues""
""B2K:Live At The House Of Blues"" is 90 minutes long, It shows chapters from each of the guys of B2K, it has a Bonus Feature (which is the making if ""Why I Love You"") and it has ""Hidden Scenes"" This DVD is well worth the $21.50 I paid for it! I have watched it over and over, and every time I watch it I notice something new! If you love to see the funny side of B2K I SERIOUSLY suggest you get this DVD it had me laughing through out the WHOLE thing! I don't wanna give away to much but for the those of you who have it...... ""Look at for J Boogs  95,000 city tour!"" LOL :P GO GET THIS DVD NOW!",1037664000,21,860,4.088757396449704
