8318035,5,B000E3731W,"As childhood friends attest, Andrew Cunanan had always been obsessed with living above everyone else's means and drawing attention to himself.  Having started out in life as a relatively poor person, his Filipino father's business success led to a series of moves to better and more affluent California locations.  Having been exposed to the lap of luxury, Cunanan was obsessed with living that type of lifestyle for himself.  The interviews with childhood friends and former classmates from the ritzy, private Bishop School he attended prove most revealing, for it was in his early teens that Cunanan began making a name for himself with his attention-craving behavior.  One classmate pretty much says it all when he describes Cunanan as the type of person who wore a dime in his penny loafers.  It was also at this time that he became openly gay and possibly began engaging in sex with older men.  When his father was charged with embezzlement and fled the country (leaving his wife destitute), Cunanan  turned his back completely on his family, willing to do anything in his determination to continue living a privileged life and to make a name for himself in the world.

Dropping out of college, Cunanan became a male gigolo, enjoying the perks of being the gay lover of a number of wealthy older men.  He began using a number of different names, entertaining friends as lavishly as possible, and creating different histories for himself.  When the inflow of money stopped, though, Cunanan became desperate.  No longer the boisterous life of the party to his friends, Cunanan took off to Minnesota to ""take care of some business"" in Minneapolis.  Soon, two of his former friends and love interests were dead.  A few days later, a real estate tycoon lay dead in Chicago.  As Cunanan headed east, he was brazen enough to use the phone in the dead man's car.  To avoid detection, he killed a cemetery caretaker in New Jersey and headed to Florida in the dead man's truck.  Gianni Versace would be his last victim, killed by two gunshot wounds to the back of the head as he was climbing the steps to enter his own house.  Eight days later, his murder spree was over.  Cunanan had killed himself, saving taxpayers the expense of keeping his worthless carcass alive for decades - but at the cost of denying us any substantive understanding of his motives.  Despite what the editorial review on this page says, there is no mention anywhere in this documentary of Cunanan even suspecting he had HIV (which an autopsy determined he did not have), let alone his seeking revenge for such a fate in the form of his awful crimes.

This A&E Biography presentation provides viewers with an excellent summary of Andrew Cunanan's twenty-seven years on Earth.  With the man's psychological oddities revealing themselves at such a young age, his story should be of particular interests to parents, educators, and counselors looking to get young people the help they need before it's too late.  None of Cunanan's friends could see his bloody murder spree coming, yet this summary of his life shows that plenty of warning signs were there all along.  There's really a strange sort of disconnect in the interviews with Cunanan's friends in San Diego, as they remember a boisterous yet caring man who loved life; it was all an act on Cunanan's part of course, but this shows exactly why this type of deranged killer is so hard to identify early on.  It's just too bad we actually have to remember this brazen murderer in order to learn from his experience because that means Andrew Cunanan, to some degree, got what he always wanted - fame.",1224460800,,3621,4.82200647249191
