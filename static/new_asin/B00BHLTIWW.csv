8568571,5,B00BHLTIWW,"Another 8 movie pack from Mill Creek Entertainment, and another home run quality-wise. Most big budget studios aren't that smart when it comes to what the fans want on DVD, so they dump them off to a smaller company to do what they will with them. Luckily for us, Mill Creek DOES know what we want on DVD, and this 8 movie pack proves it. While these films may not be luxurious deluxe edition DVD 9's, we do get each film at a fairly decent bit rate (2 films per dual layer DVD), all in anamorphic widescreen, and all with Dolby Digital sound (some in 5.1). So go ahead big studios, keep shuffling off your unwanted gems to Mill Creek. They'll make sure we get them in good, sturdy additions, and our hard-earned cash can go to the company that cares about their customers. Here's a list of the films included and a brief synopsis.

Hollywood Homicide:
A pair of detectives investigate the murder of a rap group while pursuing their other full-time professions. Welcome to Hollywood Homicide - the only profession where a guy can come to work hungry, horny, thirsty, and broke, and resolve all four by the end of the watch.

Hudson Hawk:
An ex-cat burglar (Bruce Willis) sets out to steal a series of priceless artifacts in this globe-spanning caper.

Lone Star State of Mind:
Joshua Jackson and Jamie King star in a hysterically rowdy look at small-town life and big-time trouble...deep in the heart of Texas.

The Fan:
When the San Francisco Giants pay centerfielder Bobby Rayburn $40 million to lead their team to the World Series, no one is happier or more supportive than #1 fan Gil Renard. So when Rayburn becomes mired in the worst slump of his career, the obsessed Renard decides to stop at nothing to help his idol regain his former glory.

Stealth:
The world's three best pilots are partnered with a state-of-the-art, fully-automated, pilotless, super stealth warplane - inhuman and invincible. But once in the air, it goes haywire, leaving them with one final mission - bring it down.

Vertical Limit:
An action-adventure tale of a retired climber (Chris O'Donnell) who must launch a treacherous and extraordinary rescue effort up K2, the world's second highest peak, to save his estranged sister (Robin Tunney) and her summit team.

XXX: State of the Union:
Take the action and adventure of the first XXX - triple it - and you've got the sequel starring Ice Cube, Scott Speedman and Willem Dafoe.

Simon Sez:
Basketball superstar Dennis Rodman stars as a hip Interpol agent attempting to defeat the deadly plans of a crazed arms dealer.

This is a great set of movies for the man-cave, and a great time-waster for those rainy weekends at home. I hope Mill Creek keeps up this quality of work. They've really moved on and up since their early days of public domain movie pack. While those hold a special place in my heart as well, its good to see the company striving to give the consumers what they want and deserve;a good quality product at a fair price.",1371772800,,2967,4.679462571976967
