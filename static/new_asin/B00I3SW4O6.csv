6248523,4,B00I3SW4O6,"You may have noticed there are a ton of bigfoot horror movies out there. Hopefully my reviews help. I was impressed with this title. First off, it is a found footage type of movie. There are other bigfoot FF movies but this is one of the better ones (i.e it's very competent, has good continuity, and there are no 3rd person shots which doom FF movies.)

A reporter and videographer are sent to cover a story in a rural area and we get some back story (reporter fooled around once too many times and is assigned to these types of stories.) What they find while joining some locals is that it is not a bear that is killing livestock and causing locals to go missing.

The acting is good (have no idea what one of the 1 star reviews is talking about), the story moves at a good pace, the action is good & there's a fair amount of blood. Others have criticized the bigfoot costumes but I liked them (they kind of have baboon faces) and the producers at least tried something different and succeeded (IMO.)

The DVD is barebones (movie, trailer, commentary track.) Easily one of the better bigfoot flicks to come out in the last 10 years.",1428364800,2,1134,4.390476190476191
6248524,3,B00I3SW4O6,"Effective, fast-paced, low budget shaky-cam Bigfoot movie. I liked the creature costume, plus its great speed and strength. Movie resembles Exists , with a little Legend of Six Fingers sans the humor. Recommended!",1428019200,,213,5.484848484848484
6248525,4,B00I3SW4O6,pretty good movie,1426204800,,17,5.0
6248526,2,B00I3SW4O6,Really annoying characters and the creature was not very good.  I was very irritated that I even bothered to watch this one. Also it was one of those filmed with a video camera found footage type movie which I do not like. Nothing and no one memorable in this mess of a movie.,1425513600,2,276,4.2075471698113205
6248527,3,B00I3SW4O6,"This could've been a really good foundfootage bigfoot movie...it had a ok cast,great forest scenery,bodys mutilated,pretty good scare scenes, including as the search part was looking for whatever was killing cattle and humans,a search dog got thrown thru the air about 30 feet high and about 50 feet in distance right at the feet of the search party! Alas,its one flaw was a big one..the monster was one of the poorest monsters of all time!!What were the film makers thinking as they put together this pretty good film,only to have bigfoot look like a Neanderthal man!! And a ridiculous one at that!!The beast did not match the carnage he was causing(torn off limbs,bodys ripped in half,and it didn't match his blood curdling growl. It seemed to small and wasn't scary at all. I could only imagine kinda laughing after hearing these scary howls coming out of the forest and then aiming my rifle shaking in fear.when out jumps neanderthal man!!! This actually coulda been a 4 star movie,the guy(or gals)did a pretty good job and it held my interest ...but the design of the creature was BAD!!!",1425513600,7,1092,4.8449197860962565
6248528,2,B00I3SW4O6,"Not the best, but okay,  typical ending",1424217600,2,39,4.571428571428571
6248529,4,B00I3SW4O6,"This movie could have been great.  The acting wasn't bad, it had a decent plot, and it definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.  HOWEVER, the creature looked TERRIBLE.  I think I could have drummed up a better costume myself.  They didn't even attempt to make it look like a bigfoot costume.  Why do these bigfoot movies keep doing this to us? I really wanted to give it five stars but just couldn't after looking at that pathetic costume.",1424044800,8,441,4.395061728395062

6248532,1,B00I3SW4O6,This dvd is absolutely stupid! Can't even watch the movie! The only way we can watch it is with the producers commentary on. Who wants to watch a movie like that?! Can't hear the movie but the producers voice is definitely overwritten onto the movie!,1422576000,,250,4.5777777777777775
6248533,3,B00I3SW4O6,"Well, certainly not anything spectacular, but not a bad film, over all. Starts out rough, though, and none of the characters are the least bit likeable until you get into the movie a ways. Acting was stiff starting out, too. Beautiful scenery, though -- the mountains of Montana made a nice change from the usual California or Washington forests or south eastern swamps. Of course, the found footage schtick is an old and tired one now, but it isn't too bad here, although I found Willow Creek to be far superior. About my biggest complaint would be the sasquatch -- it was weird looking and not very effective. Didn't like it at all, although the movie's format meant that you only got quick glimpses of it, so that worked in their favor.

Could have been better. Could have been worse.",1421625600,7,787,4.621428571428571
6248534,4,B00I3SW4O6,"One of the better Bigfoot movies, along with ""Abominable."" Good set up and introduction to the major characters, good build-up to the action, lots of suspenseful scenes, and the creature is actually pretty well portrayed. Better than most of the Bigfoot flicks out there!",1420588800,2,271,5.181818181818182
6248535,1,B00I3SW4O6,"ok... a review that is written by an unpaid reviewer that is not connected to the movie. The best part of the movie was the box cover... then it went downhill! acting was atrocious, as was the casting. Absolute crap! Don't waste you money on the film.... come to my yard sale this summer and I will give you my copy, as I wasted the money to buy it, and the time to watch it. I could have made a better movie by filming in my yard!

I followed the raving reviews on this and other sites and am left to wonder what movie the reviewers actually watched.... because it could not have been this movie... truly a very bad amateur attempt at selling a crappy movie. They got my money... don't waste yours on this garbage.",1420588800,6,715,4.218978102189781
6248536,5,B00I3SW4O6,Wow a found footage creature feature where they actually show the beast!!! Awesome Bigfoot on the loose flick with gore and great action. Found footage done right.,1417996800,,163,5.074074074074074

8638886,5,B00I3SW4O6,"There are so many bad Sasquatch horror movies out there. I was actually surprised by this one, it was actually good! The effects were top notch and the Sasquatch looked very well done. The creature looked very ugly too. The camera is shaky at times, but it works for this movie. This is definitely one of the better Sasquatch/Bigfoot movies Ive seen. Nice scenery too and great acting as well. I would definitely recommend to Bigfoot horror fans. I would also recommend Exists if your looking for another similar good Bigfoot found footage flick.",1459987200,,546,4.819148936170213
8638887,2,B00I3SW4O6,"as a movie buff of B rated movies, this I must say was a touch below my standards. The acting bad, the Bigfoot bad, The country side beautiful. Go a head and get it for your collection of Sasquatch movies. It came on time.",1457049600,3,222,4.068181818181818
