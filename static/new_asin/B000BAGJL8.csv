2409515,5,B000BAGJL8,"This dvd is great! It has over 14 songs, very bright colors, and educational. My five yr. old loves it, and our baby dances and claps to it! Must buy!",1199923200,,150,4.033333333333333
2409516,2,B000BAGJL8,"This DVD is infuriating. Can't the menu come up right after the disc loads? I often let my child watch a video while I'm doing chores elsewhere in the house. That means I need to put the thing in the player and walk away - - not stand there waiting for Barney to talk for five minutes before the darn menu pops up. My DVD player doesn't allow me to fast forward it, either. Some other Barney videos similarly hold the parent hostage. Why is this necessary?",1179792000,3,456,4.252873563218391
2409517,1,B000BAGJL8,"As Barney shows go this isn't a bad one but it gets a low rating because this is an old show being sold with a new name. If you want to save some money just buy a used copy of ""Barneys Beach Party"" which is the exact same show.",1134864000,10,227,3.6530612244897958
2409518,4,B000BAGJL8,"(...)

It's just Barney's Beach Party with bonus features. If you people who hated the original DVD for not having bonus features, it's your lucky day! I loved the original and I know I'd like this too.",1134259200,7,202,4.45945945945946

2409528,5,B000BAGJL8,"""One"" of the times we watched this video it was raining outside.  I put my grandson's little chair close to the french doors.  I opened the door and let him touch the falling rain and sit and watch the rain. Then when I put on the video I pointed out that he had rain like the kids on the video.  He really liked that.",1391385600,,318,3.9375

2409536,4,B000BAGJL8,"My 19 month and 3 year old grandchildren loved it.  It's sweet.  Adults, it's not for you... it's for the little ones, so if you find it syrupy sweet just try and get over yourself.  Barney would have said that nicer than I did.",1363478400,,228,4.136363636363637
2409537,5,B000BAGJL8,"Grandchildren enjoyed watching and pretending to enjoy the beach with Barney.  They love the beach and. Barney!
Great price for quality item.",1351814400,,141,5.409090909090909
2409538,4,B000BAGJL8,"I am sure Barney is wonderful for getting children to use their imaginations and getting up and dancing and singing, but it does get old to the adults in the room after multiple viewings.  I don't blame Barney.  Children like the same thing over and over, adults don't! I also realize that actually going to the beach might increase the cost of production, but the fake one looks really fake.  Is this part of using the imagination?",1247616000,,432,4.584415584415584
