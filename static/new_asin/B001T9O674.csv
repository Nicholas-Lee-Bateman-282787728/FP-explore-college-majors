3788674,4,B001T9O674,"This is a gem of a film.  It captures one of those nooks of America that most people never hear about, never mind see.  We often think of back country skiing as a modern, dangerous sport that few people would ever think about engaging in.  This film helps to shed light on an area that has been used by thousands of people to back country ski for nearly a century.

This film does leave a few things out and you will enjoy it most if you have hiked Tuckerman's Ravine or at least have knowledge of Mt. Washington and it's incredible history.",1449187200,,541,4.2745098039215685

8340857,3,B001T9O674,It's an okay film but lacks in not having enough actual skiing film footage.  So much dialogue but not enough action.  You'll learn a lot about this skiing location if one ever desires to go.,1462233600,,191,4.428571428571429
8340858,4,B001T9O674,I hiked up the head-wall circa 1978. I had my skis with me but as I ascended I realized that I was way out of my depth. I continued to the summit (it was early May) sat down and had a long lunch with a little red wine. As I sat there I thought something is wrong with this picture. Then it dawned on me: there was NO wind at all. Extremely unusual for Mt. Washington. 100 mile visibility. It was a great day and this doco helped me remember.,1458000000,,441,3.911111111111111
