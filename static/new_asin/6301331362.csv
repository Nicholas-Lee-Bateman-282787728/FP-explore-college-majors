325068,5,6301331362,"I couldn't believe my eyes when i read this movie was finally being released on dvd next year; i had to blink and read it again!  A minor gem, w/great acting across the board. I believe this earned Mason her first Best Actress nom, and boy it was well-deserved.  Caan is great as always.  I would love to hear a commentary by director Mark Rydell, but will settle for just a good, cleaned up dvd transfer; the VCR version looks pretty shoddy.  Highly recommended!  (Look for some other great actors in smaller parts too!)",1167350400,2,521,4.5
325069,4,6301331362,"The uncertainty of life in the early 70's is on display in this movie and James Caan and Marsha Mason handle the tough assigment with outstanding performances. This is not a formula romantic comedy by any stretch of the imagination and thank goodness for that.

Caan stars as John Baggs Jr, a Navy man, who finds the freedom of life on the seas very much to his liking. That is, until he meets Marsha Mason's character Maggie (possibly named after Stephen Crane's charater Maggie: A Girl of the Streets) a troubled single mother and barfly. The two meet naturally enough in a bar, end up at Maggie's place for what both accept will be a one night stand, but turns into a real relationship soon afterwards. It's at this point when the movie really excels and allows the two stars to work their craft. Many issues are tackled and the director pulls no punches in illustrating life at the bottom of the socio-economic level.

This movie is a must see for anyone interested in seeing two actors who can really act, in a story that makes you think, and is well supported by several fine supporting actors (especially the boy playing Maggie's son).",1141948800,22,1142,4.620689655172414
325070,4,6301331362,"Liked it every time I have seen it - except! - the producers/director/wardrobe/etc., had the Navy characters fairly correct, lotsa hair. There are a few well executed movies out there with this same malady - trying to run a few Marines through it and doing it very clumsily. Anyone, never mind former Marines, that has ever seen a Marine would recognize that those folks trying to play Marines in these movies are simply laughable, if not down right insulting to the way actual Marines look! Even in 1973, any PFC seeing another Marine with as much hair as these actors displayed would have ushered them to the nearest barber! Only drawback/regret with CL is that they didn't bother to get the Marine players at least cosmetically correct...",1102032000,2,741,4.84251968503937
325071,5,6301331362,I remember watching this movie when it first came to the theater and thinking that the actors were exactly as I had envisioned them while I was reading the book.  Great movie.  Marsha Mason is a delight and deservedly got the Oscar nomination.  James Caan is perfect as the put-upon sailor whose records have been misplaced causing him to be land-locked.  Mason is wonderful as a hooker who is perpetually down-on-her-luck.  This movie should be on DVD.  I'll add it to my collection.,1034035200,28,484,4.771084337349397
325072,4,6301331362,"The beginning was kind of boring, but as it dragged on it got a little interesting. Let's just put it this way, the movie climaxes then tires out. But the fact that it was released in 1973, it had done good addressing the interracial bond between the mother, Marsha Mason and her son, Kirk Calloway. When James Caan, the navy officer stepped in and took on the role of fatherhood, because the mother decided she couldn't take it anymore and bolted out of the relationship; it was a little strange but touching. All in all, it was a good movie.",1029283200,2,543,4.44
325073,4,6301331362,"Very good movie, probably James Caan's best role other than Sonny Corleone.  Oscar nominated Marsha Mason is perfect!  Good songs by Randy Newman.  A litle dated in spots, but worht it for Mason alone!",1025395200,3,201,4.852941176470588

I'd remembered how great Marcia Mason was (she got the Best Actress Oscar for it) but now see how amazing James Caan and child actor Kirk Calloway were. The plot is seamless, with lovely satiric hooks. It's a romantic, funny, visually stunning and uplifting film . . . about a really nice Navy guy, but it also has more social bite than most present-day romantic comedies.",1408838400,2,413,4.75

325259,4,6301331362,A little seen gem with James Caan playing a sailor on shore leave who's paperwork gets lost.

325260,3,6301331362,"This is a gritty and thoroughly depressing film about a sailor on leave who becomes involved in the life of a prostitute who is also a single mother and newly pregnant. The only thing one can say about it that is positive is the presence of Marsha Mason in her third film and first starring role. She is a standout and gives the film its only life. For this she earned her first Best Actress Oscar nomination and it was most deserved.

325262,4,6301331362,"I am a veteran of the navy, and even though I served as an officer onboard destroyers I found the storyline and acting by James Caan to be extremely credible. Yes, there is some Hollywood in the film, but the general flavor and tenor of Cinderella Liberty is very much in keeping with the lifestyles of ""squids"" I the 1970s and 1980s US Navy.

325325,5,6301331362,"The terrific '70s film Cinderella Liberty is a study in loneliness between two rudderless people - a sailor on leave (James Caan), and a bar girl/hooker with no illusions (Marsha Mason).  Their lives intertwine beginning with a pool game, and their up & down relationship really draws you in emotionally.  The music underscoring the movie is jazzy and haunting, particularly the track ""Nice To Be Around"" sung with such pathos by Paul Williams and written by the great composer John Williams (""Born Free""), and a gorgeous harmonica version of the same song done beautifully by the great Toots Thielemans.  CD versions of the soundtrack are out of print and very pricey, but you can still find the soundtrack LP record at reasonable prices.",1378166400,3,739,4.991869918699187

325331,5,6301331362,"I have hunted for a VHS or DVD of this movie for years. It is a wonderful story with a wonderful cast.  I was in the Navy...enlisted and at sea.  This movie gets the Navy right...I don't mean out to sea, but life on a navy base between ships, the Shore Patrol duty, the all ""navy"" characters.  Perhaps it was only because I identified with a lot of the scenes but I found this film, for lack of a better word, ""Charming""...and of course nostalgic...the good and the bad about being in the service and in the navy in particular. Don't misunderstand, I enjoyed the navy though sometimes life at close quarters is not easy especially at sea. This film centers on liberty, life in the transit barracks, what happens when they lose your records, and how some old salts could not live ""on the outside"" while others would prefer getting out early.  I would be surprised if anyone who saw this would not find it enjoyable. Marsha Mason was wonderfully authentic as the tough down on her luck single mother, and her son, both of whom fended as best as they could. Caan was the perfect Squid.  He looked the part and acted the part like he had been in for a decade. Maybe you hadda been there...but I really enjoyed it.",1354320000,7,1209,4.403587443946188
325332,4,6301331362,"This is a delightful film, perhaps lesser known than some, with great performances by James Caan and Marsha Mason. Caan is a sailor, a career Navy man, who because of a minor medical problem, becomes stranded without records and pay in Seattle, Washington. Mason is a single mother of a bi-racial son who ""accepts favors"" from men like Caan to survive. Caan, wandering the seedy streets of downtown Seattle, becomes attached to Mason and begins to care about her son. The story is filled with humor and angst, and is character driven as Caan and Mason are pulled together and apart. The conclusion is touching. If you like good acting and interesting, colorful characters, you'll enjoy this one.",1349136000,,695,4.898305084745763
325383,5,6301331362,"I enlisted in the Navy at age 17 in February, 1945 and became a ""lifer,"" staying for over 20 years. This movie was made in the 70's but depicts much of what it was like when I was in. As I watched it I was reminded of the time I spent in the old Brooklyn receiving station waiting for transportation to a new ship, and the liberties in Brooklyn, New York in the early fifties.

I don't recall ever seeing a ""bar girl"" that looked like Marsha Mason but I have seen hundreds of them, not only on New York, but in seaport bars around the world, and miss Mason played the part as though she had lived it, with all the pathos and exuberance one would see in those sad and lonely women. She deserved her nomination and should have won.

James Caan could have been me or any number of sailors who found a home in the Navy and loved the life at sea. He was a Bos'n Mate First Class, the senior right arm rate when I entered the Navy, one that was all Navy and much admired by by the rest of the crew. His predicament of having his service records misplaced, while not a usual occurance, did happen at times with all the accompanying problems. I got a kick out of the pay line scene. They used to post the pay list on bulletin boards showing how much money each man had coming and he would then fill out a pay ""chit"" which he presented to the paymaster who would dole out the money, usually including several $2 bills.

So now my reminiscences  are over and I am feeling all nostalgic, and that should tell you that this movie is a classic portrayal of part of Navy life as it was in the past, when  sailors had to pick up their liberty cards before leaving the ship or station, when the Master At Arms was king and when no civilian clothes were allowed. Watch the movie and enjoy it as much as I did. I waited for the DVD to come along and I will order one. My VHS tape is worn out, as am I.",1287619200,20,1883,4.064690026954178

I would really love to find the movie Chaper 2 they did together. I especially the part when he calls her by mistake when he mixes up a publisher's number and the number of a callgirl his brother is trying to hook him up with. or when Marsha's character comes back early to her apartment and finds her friend played by Valerie Harper and her future brother in law Joe Bolona making out.

James Caan and the movie's dialog is as unforgettable as that best movie of all time-The Godfather.  Watching this will show anyone the extent that the movie industry has deteriorated.  The slow cook method of making a masterpiece does not happen today.  The scenes were shot on location or modified locations. You will agree that Caan and Mason are not just perfect.  They are a glorious treat.
  The baby delivery scene was of a real person of poverty giving birth.  Many other break-through, (first ever filmed) events were introduced in this picture.  Even though the screen play was written from only one chapter in a book, every scene is a masterpiece.  It is a story of the hopelessness  of a past history loaded with heavy baggage. The clawing and slipping is as tragic as a Greek play, but so real and gritty.  Falling back to the sloppy comfort that is safe (but still damaging) happens all around us but is all most never filmed.

beautiful scores I've ever heard.  ""Nice to be Around"", from the film, is just gorgeous. John & Paul Williams
wrote the wonderful jazz based score & song.  The soundtrack was released on vinyl when the film came
out in 1973, and can still be readily found. The harmonica solo's by the great Toots Thielemans comprise
some of the best playing he's ever done, and powerfully enhance the emotionally touching scenes in the
picture. John Williams' masterful orchestral scoring and Paul Williams' lyrics for the love theme, along with
his three vocals on the soundtrack, helped earn them two Grammy nominations for their work on the film.
The ""Cinderella Liberty"" soundtrack was released on cd by Intrada in 2008 in a limited edition (3000 copies)
release with a wonderful booklet containing photo's from the film, production background, and information
on the score's creation along with each of the twelve tracks (same as the vinyl version). It's a fine military
film directed by Mark Rydell with excellent work from James Caan and Marsha Mason in a doomed romance,

I will just say that if you ""get"" this movie, it will be one of your favorites.  To me, it is a classic that should be taught in film school.

325391,4,6301331362,"""Cinderella Liberty"" is another example as to why the Seventies were so great.  Filmmakers could tackle more provocative subject matter but not at the expense of character.  James Caan's turn as John Baggs, a loner Navy lifer, couldn't be anymore different than Sonny Corleone.  This is a nuanced performance of quiet understatement that holds your attention as well as the film together.  Caan was inexplicably overlooked by the Academy.  Why I don't give the film the full five star treatment is I didn't buy the central romance between Baggs and Maggie the streetwalker played by Marsha Mason, who was nominated.  Outside of a plot convenience I didn't get this relationship at all.  For that matter I didn't buy Mason as a worldweary lady of the night.  There is more chemistry between Baggs and Maggie's bi-racial son Doug played by Kirk Calloway.  There is a streetwise naturalness to Calloway's performance that you almost believe he was plucked from the mean streets.  Another debit is the god-awful warbling of Paul Williams on the soundtrack.  Williams won an Oscar for his treacly ""Evergreen"" in 1976.  Randy Newman had to wait 16 times before he won.  Go figure.  Of note is that this is one of two naval flicks released in 1973 based on Daryl Ponicsan novels, the other being ""The Last Detail"" starring Jack Nicholson and directed by Hal Ashby.  I give ""The Last Detail"" the edge here but both would make a superb double-bill.",1175385600,3,1439,4.8884297520661155
