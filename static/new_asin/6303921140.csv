7855691,4,6303921140,"We first rented this from the video store. I didn't know if my daughter would even sit to watch it - since she loves Minnie Mouse (and I DIDN'T see Minnie Mouse anywhere on the cover...)
She watched this movie over and over - I watched little bits at a time and thought it was pretty cute. Well, upon taking it back to the video store to turn in - she cried... and cried... so I promised her we would get it again. I purchased it for her birthday and here I finally sat down to watch the entire video with her and in one of the skits - Mickey is expected to 'capture' the Mean Giant... I was alittle ASTONISHED  to find Mickey Mouse being 'somewhat' violent to the Giant - but I guess in this day and age - it's OK......(?) Also, one other part that I had to EXPLAIN was what the Giant was doing when he rolled up some straw (like a cigarette), lit it and began to smoke it. I know, I know - it's pretty basic but I guess because there are no cigarette ads on tv anymore - I just didn't think I would have this conversation with her yet, (at 3!)
It's a good movie - but just a word of warning - you may be explaining some things to your kids after they see it.
Have a GREAT day!
