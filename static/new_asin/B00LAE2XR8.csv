6478580,3,B00LAE2XR8,"What a wonderful enchanting film that resonates with the power of not giving up, going through adversity, and truly finding the ability to move forward in life despite the obstacles that stand your way.  Director Conner really emphasized a real personal and empathetic touch to this film, with a cast that cared to be in the film, with a message that really hits home.  Great film.

6478585,3,B00LAE2XR8,"Not sure where the disconnect was but something was off about this movie . Not sure if it was poorly written, the actors suck, the director didn't really have a good  vision or if most if it ended up on the cutting room floor but whatever it was it took what should have been a great movie with a lot of depth and made it one dimensional, predictable  and left a lot plot holes/questions. I just felt  cheated  cause I can see the potential  for a great movie but whatever it was it made the statement  ""one bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch"" a lie.",1439510400,,555,4.188679245283019

6478591,4,B00LAE2XR8,This was a nice message on forgiveness and about women staying on top of their health early detection for breast cancer.
