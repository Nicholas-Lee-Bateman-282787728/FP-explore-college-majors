1850275,2,B00008L3WX,As a dancer I was looking for a video to help me improve my technique for fall auditions. If your even a slightly trained dancer pass on this video. The pictures on the back and front of the case do look complicated; but they're not IN the video. The video is hella easy. And i didn't feel the burn. Now if you have no dance experience then it might be different for you.,1059436800,19,371,4.095890410958904
1850276,4,B00008L3WX,"I am a ballet dancer, and when I wanted to audition for a ballet school she told me I wasn't ready yet and should work on my strength, and told me to buy it. Now when I went to the store all I found was Ballet Workout 2. So I bought it.
If you didn't go with the first tape, it is alright! The tape had no advancing from workout 1. The Previews are a little bit long, such as the intro and dance magazines, but yet again, it could be worse. It goes stright into combinations, which they try to break it down for you, but yet again lets not fool ourselfs, it is a video, they are the New York City Ballet, and we are just trying to look for a fitness kick.
It can be diffcult since they go stright to plie into positions, 1, 2, and 3, then goes into relives, tundus, and other begining combinations with walks. But you will get lost, so it takes practice to fully get it. After some combinations, mostly working on your body line like proper torso and pelvis alignment known as brazing, where you push in your stumach to your spine and rotate your pelvis up. Beware! You  must stay in that position for the rest of the workout, ok so you don't have to, but it would work better if you do. All dancers must braze their stumachs in dance, and hello, this is a ballet workout.
Then they go into floor work, like crunches and leg workouts. The crunches are crative, such as circle crunches, bicycle crunches, and regular crunches. They don't over work you, only doing at leat eight at the time and at least five different crunches. Believe me, you will feel the burn but it won't wear you out. Then you will focus on leg work, then the buttocks, and then back muscles.
Next is mostly bar work, without the bar. You will do mostly tundus in different postions, batmas and deleges, (Excuse my spelling) And you arms  will get tired from holdin them in first postion! Next is a cool off segment, where you'll do simple piles with so walks and arm movements. Very Simple. Next you'll be learning a small portion of a dance by Geroge Balinchine, founder of the New York City Ballet. It mostly for cardio work, with fast movements and a hard combitions for those who lose themselves in fast workouts. They break it down, but still it was confusing to me. It takes work, and believe me the results will be great. Your butt will firm, your abs will shrink, your thighs will becaume thighs again, arms will be defined, and most of all your metabolism will rise.
And at the end if you get totally confused on ballet terms, there is a dictionary sort, in the back, going over plies, declages, and postions. It take about six weeks for a real dancer body. I'm not gurateeing anything. You must work it to make it work! Really push yourself, and it will get simplier over time.",1058745600,207,2759,4.324324324324325
1850277,4,B00008L3WX,"I purchased the first volume of this series almost 3 years ago and became so utterly consumed by it I signed up for adult ballet classes and still take them!  I recommend this video for anyone toying with the idea of getting in shape using ballet and think this one is probably more ideally suited to a true beginner than its predecessor (due to glossary & more instruction).  However if you already own and love the first volume, then by all means buy this!  It is very similar, and I think I may enjoy the floor & barre work more on the first one, but the dance sequence from Tarantella is so much fun to learn & will make you feel like a true ballerina!",1056931200,33,656,4.232
1850278,5,B00008L3WX,I have the New York City Ballet Workout Vol 1 and I really enjoy it.  This is a good low-impact workout and it's relatively easy to follow.,1405382400,,139,4.148148148148148
1850279,2,B00008L3WX,This was simply not any fun to do.  I tried it 2 or 3 times.  I have no background in ballet and found it was not an appropriate workout for me.  I also found the way it was shot to be off-putting.,1383696000,,197,3.642857142857143
1850280,3,B00008L3WX,"Good delivery time. The core of the DVD is well done and well demonstrated, but there is much too much annoying expository footage.",1379462400,,131,4.739130434782608
1850281,4,B00008L3WX,I really love the floor work in this work out video  - I don't have patience for the rest of it though... but the floor work is amazing and my abs feel very flat when I stand up at the end.,1373241600,,189,3.6097560975609757
1850282,5,B00008L3WX,Replaces and updates VCR tape that finally broke.  Spouse favorite for many years.  Now she does yoga and pilates combined.,1369267200,,123,5.1
1850283,5,B00008L3WX,"I already had the Vol 1 workout DVD but was annoyed at the sections where the music drowned out the instructor or there was simply incomplete instruction given. The Vol 2 version took care of all those problems and even added some great new moves. I really love it! The sections are broken up into do-able sessions or you can play them all at once or you can even customize to your liking. The instructions are clear and easy to follow and a booklet is included that has great pictures and explanations of the ballet moves. It was very helpful for me as I have never experienced a ballet class but wanted a longer, leaner look and to move in a more graceful fashion. I have only practiced this program for a short time (2 months) but can see and feel the wonderful results. Another great DVD I can recommend is from Mary Helen Bowers - Ballet Beautiful - Total Body Workout. Both of these workouts were well worth the reasonable price I paid. No, I will never dance like a Ballerina but maybe I can look like I could!",1363046400,5,1017,4.3578947368421055
1850284,5,B00008L3WX,it helped my fat ass loose 20 lbs in a few months. lengthens muscles and works that ass out hardcore.,1359936000,,101,4.1
1850285,5,B00008L3WX,"This DVD was excellent. I do not get the opportunity to work out that often, so when I do, I want it to count. This DVD takes it one step up from the first DVD. Having danced when I was younger, I want to keep the ballet legs and posture through my 50's and I believe this tape will help me achieve this. I also noticed my arms ached a little bit during the workout from all the arm movements, so that is a red flag for me to do this workout a little more often. While I did not break a sweat, I feel that the muscle control and coordination are essential for my current needs. I strongly suggest this DVD for anyone who thinks ballet is easy and for those of you that already know it is not, it is a real mood enhancer.",1356912000,2,720,3.9383561643835616
1850286,3,B00008L3WX,"I am a beginning adult ballet student and bought this to supplement my classwork. It is clearly very well made and has very good tips for ballet posture and form and is a good ballet-inspired work-out. The visuals of the dancers are inspiring and I enjoyed seeing them. HOWEVER I will probably never do this work-out again because I find the narrator's voice kind of creepy. In other work-out videos I have done I find that the energy, personality and fun of the person leading the workout is what keeps me coming back and in this case the dancers themselves do not speak, you just hear the voice of an off-screen narrator who sounds .... creepy. I don't know how else to describe it. Again, there are a lot of high-quality elements so Its worth checking out -- others may not feel the same way as I about the narration.",1356825600,,820,4.473333333333334
1850287,4,B00008L3WX,it is cheaper than taking actual classes in person. it is not exactly what I wanted but it is ok.,1355356800,,97,3.9
1850288,5,B00008L3WX,It's  a great video .  Love every combination and all the exercises.  A great opportunity to workout with all these stars from the New York City Ballet.,1348704000,,152,4.555555555555555
1850289,4,B00008L3WX,"You know the drill-- ever since the 80s, workout videos are either filled with a ponytailed blonde bouncing around and barking at you in her ""boot camp"" OR a ponytailed blonde chanting ""om"" as she sweetly beckons you to open up your heart chakra. If neither one of these is your style, you must get this workout. I've been working out regularly for about 13 years and have seen far too many videos and DVDs than I care to admit, and this is the only one that seems ""grown up"" to me. It's shot beautifully, the music is lovely, and the gentlemen are, ahem, pleasing to the eye. If you're injured, this workout is a boon. It teaches you to use your body to increase strength and flexibility while avoiding injury, and the floor exercises are especially useful if you have a bad knee or are recovering from a physical malaise.

Why 4 stars? I wouldn't recommend this workout as a way to lose weight, per se. I add it to my normal regime to lengthen and strengthen, but in and of itself, there simply isn't enough to raise your heart rate to an intensity required for results for people who need to lose more than 20 lbs. However, it absolutely will strengthen everything and aid in increasing your metabolism through muscle toning. It's also fun to do and makes me feel pretty. So, if you need to lose more than 20 pounds, I recommend doing something a little more intense and cardiovascular in addition to this workout.

However, I think everyone could benefit from this fun and pretty dance-based workout. I enjoy it quite a lot.",1321574400,3,1528,4.512635379061372
1850290,5,B00008L3WX,"Enjoying ballet and choreography generally, I wanted to learn more by doing.  It's far better as both exercise and learning to do the moves, and I've found NYCB2 the GoTo DVD for daily exercise, both as a warmup for anything else, and in conjunction with other workout elements.

It is a big improvement over Vol 1, and I do hope they'll do a Vol3 and more.  But for now, I know of no other product- book or audio-visual, that offers as much as this one.

Of course, there are limitations as with any home instruction.  One tends to find a move or jump that seems to work and right or wrong, to repeat it.  If right, great, ""good job"" as Peter Martins would say, but if wrong, Peter will still say ""good job,"" but then he's not really there!

Starting with one, then two mirrors, and being more critical about it, one realizes an in person class with a teacher is the proper way to go.",1317427200,,885,4.295180722891566
1850291,4,B00008L3WX,"I've used this DVD a few times and have been very happy with it. It's calming, and feels very elegant. The stretching segment is wonderful, and I've often just done that after biking. My only complaint is that they don't stay in the stretching poses long enough, but pausing the DVD until I'm ready takes care of that.",1299283200,,318,4.5
1850292,5,B00008L3WX,"I am a person in average health. I have enough muscle to be able to do a quick sprint and open a pickle jar, with some extra fat around my belly and thighs. I am also a bit  more flexible than the average person. I had been looking for a good workout, that was challenging, but not overbearing for a long time, and this one fits the bill.

The workout starts out with a warm up and keeps your heart beating throughout.  The floor work is not unbearable but will make your abs burn.  the standing toning area is challenging - especially if you have issues with balance but you can feel it working.  While there is not much upper body work, for mostly all of the standing routines you leave your arms in the air making them work of of their own weight. It's a graceful workout forcing you to push yourself and your muscles. For me, by the end of this video my limbs felt jelly like, my back could feel the strain, my joints much looser, and I was lightly sweating.

I don't believe this video would be challenging to someone who was already in shape, and toned.  For the rest of though New York City Ballet Workout, Vol. 2 is just right.",1292544000,,1135,4.226851851851852
1850293,3,B00008L3WX,"The exercises and narration are extremely slow.  The stretches are OK.  I expected more stretching exercises which would lead to better flexibility in ballet, such as how to improve Grand Battement or how to improve your Arabesque.  I was a little disappointed.",1270252800,,261,5.166666666666667
1850294,5,B00008L3WX,"This video helps strengthen and tone. It is very relaxing. I love the stretching segment,that is the part I use the most!",1236038400,,121,4.545454545454546
1850295,2,B00008L3WX,"I was actually looking for a video that would take you through an entire dance class.  The warmup at the barre, floor work, and then onto combination work across the floor.  But it was way too much like an instructional video... and yet their combination was more like a jazz/tap combo routine instead of ballet.  The real reason I wanted this video was because I was a dancer from age 2 1/2 (tap, ballet and jazz) until college, when I began to teach.  I opened my own studio in my late 20s.  Then moved to the West coast, and taught for 10 years as a ""traveling dance teacher"" to schools and daycares.  By age 42, I stopped dancing.  I gained weight going from a lifelong adult weight of 125 lbs (at 5'6"") to 170 lbs.  I'm now 48 yrs old.  I can't function at this weight... feel terrible all the time.  But I DO know one thing... that when a body starts dancing again, it ""remembers"" how to get back in line.  So I was looking for a ""dance class on video"" for adults.  Anyway, this was a waste of money for me.",1235433600,,1013,4.191709844559585
1850296,4,B00008L3WX,"Growing up I was a ballerina and quit when I got married. When I saw this video I was excited because I have just had my first child and need a good workout video to tighten up. The lessons get your heart going but are not very aerobic. I love this video for the floor workout, especially the ab routine. I have not learned the combination at the end of the video yet, but it does look like it would really get you to sweat!(lots of jumping)",1195948800,,441,4.080459770114943
1850297,4,B00008L3WX,"I'm a 27 yr. old male, and not a professional dancer.  I have taken no classes.  I enjoy ballet and figured this DVD would be a good way to get some exercise while learning more about an art that I love.  NYC Ballet Workout 2 is the volume I prefer.  I have both 1 and 2 and 2 gives much better instruction and pushes you along more effectively.  You can sweat as little or as much as you like, I've found.  Sometimes it's hard to get over the dancers' ability while you struggle to keep up, but once you get over that you're in for a demanding but rewarding workout.  The very first time you do this workout you will be frustrated.  I promise that you will improve steadily each time you perform the workout.",1190937600,7,709,4.2
1850298,4,B00008L3WX,"With frequent pacing changes, you are working out slow one minute and fast the next. The rapid movements get your heart beating faster, but the graceful flowing movements make you feel more relaxed.

The narration made me feel very relaxed, so the entire first two-thirds of the second workout seemed more relaxing and centering than invigorating. The exercises begin with a warm-up and progress to dance steps, floor exercises for the abs, legs and arms. During the exercises you do have to count for yourself and there are bonus exercises later in the program that you can add in to your own routine.

While I found it much easier to follow the first DVD, the second DVD has much more complex moves and you need a much higher degree of intense concentration and precise balance to enjoy the exercises. Having some split-sole sneakers might help with the jumping, but you can do most of the workout in bare feet or with ballet slippers.

The booklet in the second DVD shows more of the exercises and has a glossary for Turnout, Demi Pli&eacute;, Grand Pli&eacute;, Releve, Tendu, D&eacute;gag&eacute;, Pass&eacute;, Fondu, Grand Battement, Changement de pieds, Pas de Basque and Piqu&eacute; Arabesque. On the DVD, all of these are shown in detail in a section in the special features.

After trying the workout a few times, you may also want to personalize it and there is a way to select specific exercises and then play them all at once for your own personalized routine. The sections you can choose from include:

Upper Body

Lower Body

Comgined Movement

Stretches

Abdominal Strengthening

Floor Barre Supine

Floor Barre Side Lying

Floor Barre Prone

Pli&eacute; & Tendu

D&eacute;gag&eacute;

Pass&eacute; & Fondu

Grand Battement & Little Jumps

Reverence

An inspirational ""Born to Dance"" segment features all the dancers in their daily life and there is also a behind-the-scenes bonus feature as well as a number of promos for fitness studios in New York. What do dancers do after exercising? The first DVD gives a more detailed look into the dancers' lives, but this DVD has a combined section that briefly explores the dancers' interests when not dancing. Overall, the second workout is more complex and progresses into real dance steps so you can feel like a real dancer.

~The Rebecca Review",1175817600,13,2309,4.966145833333333
1850299,4,B00008L3WX,"This workout DVD is laid out in very good segments that you can mix on your own.  The degree of difficulty in the movements is not overwhelming for people like me who have always wanted to be ballet dancers but never could.  This is a challenging, but not impossibly complex, workout that will stretch you, strengthen you, and make you feel more graceful and balanced.  Some of the combination movements are more suited to experienced dancers, but fun to try nonetheless. I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1175558400,4,510,4.839080459770115
1850300,5,B00008L3WX,This is a great product for former dancers who don't or can't do regular classes anymore.  Might not be the best for beginners as proper ballet terms are used but the exercises are great for easing back into dance and keeping in shape.,1168300800,5,235,4.465116279069767
1850301,5,B00008L3WX,"My daughter has been taking ballet, dance, jazz, tap, etc. since she was two.  While she's no expert, I'm sure, she loves this DVD.  I may start doing it with her.  She was really impressed with it. I randomly bought this for her for Christmas.  It was well worth it and she uses it daily.

** edit, 4 mos. after Christmas, and she is STILL loving this and using it regularly (sadly I haven't joined her.. LOL)",1168300800,7,410,4.2727272727272725
1850302,5,B00008L3WX,"This is a beautiful, satisfying workout. Although the video doesn't simulate a ballet class, the excercises presented are excellent preparation for one. The video is narrated by Peter Martins, ballet master in chief of the New York City Ballet, and the excercises are performed by members of the corps (though I believe that at least two have left the company since this was filmed). The dancers perform the excercises impeccably! Users are given the option of dancing to classical or contemporary music and a comprehensive dictionary of ballet terms used in the video is included. I was not in great shape when I started this program and I found that with consistent practice my cardiovascular efficiency and muscle tone and strength improved more quickly than they have with the use of any other product. In the section where it outlines proper body placement this video addresses the concept of bracing which increases the effectiveness of primarily abdominal excercises but also helps to stabilize the body during other excercises. The guide included in the video suggests that one wear dance sneakers when doing the excercises, which I found actually provide more support and engage more muscles than bare feet or ballet slippers. The dance combination at the end of the video is a variation of Tarantella, a dance from the Nutcracker ballet which was presented in a step by step, easy to follow format; it was decently challenging and a great cardivascular workout. In general I found this video to be worthwhile and effective.",1166140800,11,1533,5.063241106719367
1850303,5,B00008L3WX,I really like this DVD.  I work out eveyday and this is always included once a week.  I have gained strength in my core and legs. My legs have a great shape from these exercises.  It is easy to follow.  The music is beautiful and relaxing.  Just like a ballet class.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1159056000,10,296,4.196428571428571
1850304,1,B00008L3WX,"I am an adult ballet student. I've been dancing for 4 years and wanted to be able to workout at home when I couldn't make a class. This video is not a ballet class workout - there is no bar, center, across the floor setup. There is no music for you to feel as you watch the few exercises they guide you through. It is more of an aerobics class workout. The dancers are wearing dance sneakers!  I'm very disappointed and glad it cost me less than $10 to buy this - I'd return it if I could!  The voice on the tape is horrifically monetone and the dancers are not moving to any type of music - there's the same background music playing the whole time so you can't even feel a pattern. Do not waste your time on this if you are looking to mimic a ballet class workout.",1157328000,14,765,4.059602649006623
1850305,5,B00008L3WX,"I won't go into detail about the breakdown of the workout as others have more than adequately done this - I wanted to address some of the UNFAIR CRITICISM.
Firstly those who say there is no instruction (especially the dance section at the end) may not have used the very comprehensive menu. Choose the 'play all' option and skip until you find the 'teaching combination' sections.  The dance combination is taught in 4 sections - each move is shown in slow motion with excellent voice over instruction then goes 'up tempo' and shown in the speed that the end dance has.  These segments can be repeated over and over until you 'get it'.
I have no dance experience and the grace and poise of a lame duck but it only took me no more than 5 attempts to learn most of it (by replaying each section).  I have had longer learning periods with my Cathe Friedrich step workouts!  Why do you want a dvd that you can do when you first put it in? That is just a waste of money as you will get bored quickly - I want to be able to progress.
Another criticism was the lack of explanation of ballet terminology - rubbish!  DVD comes with a booklet that shows each one and explains, and the glossary on the dvd does the same. As Peter explains, you can go to that glossary at any time in the workout if you need more help with positions.  Remember these people had years of training to get the bodies they have, it is crazy to think you will have their grace and mastery of the movements with one workout!  But with many uses of this workout you will come close, the instruction is EXCELLENT and the closest thing to one-on-one instruction you will get.
And to address one other unfair comment - you CAN skip through sections and program any/all parts of the workout USE THE MENU!!
I'd rate this workout 11/10 and only wish they would release no. 3.  A lovely change of pace from high impact aerobics and step for me - but still a challenge - especially if you do the 'dance' at the end twice!
A beautifully produced dvd, excellent quality, great menu system (especially being able to choose the music) and voice over instruction is calm and soothing to listen to.  You won't regret buying this one.",1148860800,63,2183,4.397022332506204
1850306,4,B00008L3WX,"I like this video quite a bit, but I have had a lot of issues with the DVD, which I admit could be the fault of my roommate's cheap player. Namely (and I have this problem with the first ballet workout also), if I try to skip through the chapters, it doesn't skip in a linear fashion, as with a normal movie dvd. So for example, there is a long intro that talks about the core, posture, etc. but naturally I don't want to see that every single time. But clicking next chapter doesn't skip the intro, it skips me into some weird shorter workout that cuts out the first couple of warmup exercises, and part of the workout routine at the end. Sometimes, I think this is useful, but there's actually no way for me to do the whole workout without letting the whole long intro play (fastforward can cause the same problem.)

anyway, that's a very strange thing, and hopefully not going to be the case once I get my own dvd player, but figured I should warn people. Other than that, the workout is pretty great. not sure how much I like the routine at the end, but it is a good change up, and more aerobic.",1148515200,4,1099,4.233333333333333
1850307,5,B00008L3WX,"I'm in many dance classes and on a dance team.  I was looking for a way to condition on my own outside of class and this is the best thing i have found. At the end of the workout my muscles feel like i've just been in class for an hour.  There are great excercises for everything.  It will be harder to learn if you have never danced before, but it's a good workout for anybody.  It deffinately makes you sweat.

If you're trying to decide between one and two there are only a few differences because i have both

-the first one is better organized and has more ""workout"" sections, but really they are just the overall workout broken up.

-the second one includes a choreographed dance like excercise that is very fun and challenging and broken into sections to make it easily learned

-the second one has a handy dandy glossary for people who aren't enrolled in ballet class

Other than that their the same mostly except for the actual excercises which vary.  But their both a great workout",1148083200,21,991,4.425414364640884
1850308,4,B00008L3WX,"This is good if you want something different.  I enjoy this DVD though I find it more of a taxing than a challenging workout- it's more strength than cardio.  The music, setting, and dancers are all great.  One of the female ballet dancers is so incredibly flexible that it's motivating.

It isn't an intimidating routine either.  I have no real knowledge of ballet- I didn't buy Volume 1 because the reviews for Volume 2 seemed better, and I haven't done ballet since I was about 5 years old.  I'm also not particularly coorinated but this didn't seem to be too much of a problem.  There are moments where detailed instruction wouldn't have hurt and I definitely rewind it to try to figure out some movements.  However, that just goes with the territory of ballet- it takes practice.  Granted, the elegance of ballet comes with time so mostly I started out quite clumsily but it's coming together.  Overall, a very good DVD.  I would particularly recommend this to pilates/yoga types who want something new.",1147046400,11,1008,4.76878612716763
1850309,5,B00008L3WX,I agree that it is a myth that true ballet is not done at the barre.  This is truly a ballet work out and will get you great results.  I have a friend that dances with the new york city ballet and she said that these are the excersises they use only modified (somewhat) for non-professional dancers.  You will love the challenges in this dvd and you should never need to use a barre in a realy ballet class when performing floor exercises (which is what these are).,1144627200,11,465,4.261363636363637
1850310,4,B00008L3WX,"I am a ballet dancer and I want to clarify what one reviewer said about how this DVD is not worth it because it does not teach true barre work (since none of us have a barre in our homes). While ballet is often associated with having one hand on the barre at all times, the barre is actually supposed to be used for balance checks only, with your hand lightly resting on the barre. In fact, ideally none of us would use the barre because we all have great balance. I encourage anyone interested in this DVD to try it out and know that you do not need a barre to do plis or anything else. You will actually have better balance and quicker results by not using a barre. Oh, and the best studio I've been taught at asked us to hardly use the barre at all (except when on pointe).",1144022400,17,776,4.078431372549019
1850311,5,B00008L3WX,"I really think people ought to actually WATCH or PERFORM this workout before leaving a bad review simply on their experience with the first title.

That said, I also enjoyed the first one but I do admist that this one is better.  I enjoyed the dance routines at the end.  This is clearly stated on the back cover that this one has more dance routines.  This is kind of your reward for advancing from volume 1 to volume 2.

The toning is excellent and the dancers are inspirational.",1143936000,8,481,4.420454545454546
1850312,4,B00008L3WX,"I have no dancing experience, but have enjoyed the challenge of this workout DVD.  I find the dance number at the end of the stretches and exercises is a good cardio boost, though it won't compare to time on the treadmill.  This is a good workout for toning and stretching.  And fun!",1141689600,,283,4.403846153846154
1850313,1,B00008L3WX,"So, we all know that the core of the dancer's strength, power, grace, and posture is the basic work done at the barre.  And we all know that the first dvd in this series was a complete lying dishonest ripoff because there was no true barre work (just some stupid pointless exercises that you were supposed to do lying flat on your back).  We all know that you will never achieve the beautiful dancer's body and posture unless you put in time at the barre.  We all know that any ""ballet"" workout that lacks barre work is a lie.  So tell me, is this dvd as dishonest as the first ""ballet"" dvd in this series?  Does this dvd also completely lack any true dance basics, such as real barre work, which can only be performed standing at a real barre?  Please let me know.  I don't want to throw away money on a complete waste of time with this dvd, as I did with the first one.  I'd be better off with Richard Simmons than that lying worthless misleading ""ballet"" workout that the first dvd promised.  Oh, and can you fast forward between sections in this one?  You couldn't even skip around in the first dvd.  Total ripoff.  I didn't even complete dvd #1 even once because it bore no resemblance at ALL to a real ballet class and didn't even provide the dvd advantage of letting you skip around.",1140825600,2,1290,4.329166666666667
1850314,5,B00008L3WX,"Though I don't find this workout any more challeging, except for the dance sequence ""movement combination"" at the end, I do think this one is an improvement on the first. The cueing in clear, and the narrator tells you what muscles you should be working and how to execute the movement properly. I also enjoyed the contemporary music on this dvd more (compared to the available contemporary track on the first one.) I don't think this is any more advanced than the first, though, so you could just buy this one and be happy! Anyone can do it or modify it to do it, and the low-impact movements are challenging.",1137715200,10,610,4.554545454545455
1850315,3,B00008L3WX,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be a good addition to my current yoga and running program. I was hoping it would be filled with the toning exercises that I remember from ballet class, but I was very disappointed. I did not feel as though I got any real exercise from the class. For me there were too many dance sequences and not enough toning exercises. I returned the DVD.",1137283200,9,377,4.323943661971831
1850316,5,B00008L3WX,"I Loved the Workout DVD.  I (...) am highly considering becoming a professional dancer.  If your like me and are deciding to pursue ballet as a career make sure to watch Born to Dance under special features.  This DVD has helped to drive my dream farther and I would reccommend it to anyone, even if they aren't a dancer.  It's pretty easy because they lead you step-by-step. It's a great buy.",1124236800,7,393,4.492957746478873
1850317,5,B00008L3WX,I would recommend this video over one because it offers more of a challenge.  I especially like the end portion with the dance routine. Buy this video it is worth it.,1120780800,6,166,4.354838709677419
1850318,5,B00008L3WX,"I have owned and used the first workout in this series for several years now and enjoy it thoroughly.  I have no ballet training and purchased the video after getting interested in Pilates.  I bought the second workout on DVD despite one reviewer's comment that it is virtually the same workout as the video I already own.  I was glad to learn this wasn't true.  The first workout is far easier as it requires less coordination while the second workout incorporates dance steps and arm movements in a much more complicated fashion.  It also transitions from one type of move to the next much quicker than the first workout which broke each type of move (plies, tendu, etc.) into separate segments.  Furthermore, I find the abdominal work and floor bar exercises much more challenging in this workout than in the first.

Perhaps what most distinguishes this workout from the first is the dance routine included at the end.  The first workout has little cardiovascular work and this segment (which I skip to before Reverence) really kicks up the intensity of my workout.  I also feel like I'm really learning how to dance ballet - not just engaging in ballet exercises.  I get better at the routine each time I do the workout and find myself motivated to work out more as I attempt to master the steps.  This routine is difficult to follow for those of us without dance training but equally thrilling when we amateurs find ourselves keeping up with the professionals (even if we aren't quite as graceful).

I recommend that non-dancers buy both workouts.  The first allows you to concentrate on learning rudimentary postures and moves.  The second increases the challenge with a more dynamic workout, preventing plateaus.  I now alternate between the two workouts, doing each about once a week as a supplement to my other fitness activities.",1114560000,58,1839,4.8493589743589745
1850319,5,B00008L3WX,This is a great workout video. I have taken ballet for 14 yrs and have been away from dance for about 5 yrs so it was quite easy for me to get back into the routines and exercises. I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. This has been very helpful for balance and flexibilty after having to quit all physical activites for the last year. It is better prepared than the first version with great extras and customizable exercise routines. It may be a little difficult for beginners or those who haven't taken ballet before. The routines are a little more complicated than those in the first version and at a faster pace. It has a termanology and instruction section that is of great help if you are a beginner but I would start off with nyc ballet vol 1. great stretches and instructors. I loved it. It is a great workout and has a dance routine at the end.,1113004800,4,858,4.40251572327044
1850320,4,B00008L3WX,"The contempory music choice instead of classical was a great help. Even though I have NO ballet experience whatsoever, I had no problem following. I had done many other latin, belly dance DVDs as well as yoga to help me keep up with this DVD both in following & in keeping up for 45 min.

The plies really felt good to my overcontracted muscles/tedons in my knees that keep me from doing leg lifts, etc.  I felt really toned after, even in my arms from keeping them up which are my weak spot. The floor abs workout also was a killer as well as the floor back workout.

I will however say that these videos have the best stretching excerises that I have ever done. and this dvd offers you the option of choosing how you want your work out to progress.",1088035200,50,328,4.466666666666667
1850322,3,B00008L3WX,"I started exercising daily 8 weeks ago and have been buying different workout routines to try and vary my program. I only workout at home. I like my exercise programs to be challanging and *fun*. This is semi challanging (I never broke a sweat). This is *not* fun. Now, I will preface this by saying I am the type who enjoyed Denise Austins ""Pilates for Every Body"". I thought that because I liked the standing ballet work that Denise did that I would love this one- more ballet, right! I also enjoy motivational vocal cueing. Even Veena and Neenas ""Bellydance""  voice over instruction is more enthusiastic than this. Here in NYC Ballet 2, the dancers are expressionless, and the entire instruction is done by a voice over from someone who remains completely monotone the entire video.
They are beautiful.
You may feel challanged (If you do pilates you won't feel challanged- though the exercises on the abs were unique, they work the same sort of core groups as pilates does).
Its dull if you like fun workouts.
Its way too long to have such a monotone speaker.
If I want to be serious, challanged and do mattwork- I will do a pilates routine. If I want to relax, I do yoga. I don't have a place to fit this NYC ballet program in.
If you are someone who wants ballet style toning, ***serious*** and focused on the exercises, you will enjoy this. If you want to have fun while learning ballet moves and enjoy vocal cueing and enthusiasm, you will like Jody Hoegstedt's ""Balletone"" better- which incorperates ballet style toning with enthusiasm.
But as I said, I am a person who likes motivational, fun cueing. If that doesn't matter to you, and you want to ballet tone with professional dancers you will like this.",1081900800,28,1714,4.6381578947368425
1850323,5,B00008L3WX,"I ordered this item expecting a good ballet workout, and that's what I got.  This workout focuses mostly on strength, balance, control, and flexibility, but there is also a segment at the end that contains a more aerobic workout.
If you have ever taken a ballet class, and you enjoyed it, then this would be good for you.  However, I'm not sure I would recommend it for people who have never taken a ballet class.  Without prior training, it might be more difficult to catch on, but after a few times I'm sure that a beginner would catch on.  Some of the ballet terms used are not fully explained during the workout, but there is a video glossary that should explain the terms if you are unfamiliar.
This DVD might also not be appropriate if your goal is to lose weight.  It's not designed for quick fat-burning.
One good and rather unique feature of this DVD is the ability to design your own program.  You can choose and arrange the different elements of the workout in any order that you want, making it however long you want it to be, and focusing on whichever areas of the body you want.  It's really cool.",1081728000,18,1111,4.443349753694581
1850324,3,B00008L3WX,"If you like ballet, and enjoy working out at a very ""relaxed"" level, this DVD is for you. If you like to ""feel the burn"" and enjoy motivation from your instructor, you will hate this DVD! The voice of the narrator could put me to sleep. I am so relaxed duriung this workout, that I forget what I am doing. On a more positive note, it is a complete ballet workout, and is easy to learn.(I have 10 years dance experience)I do, however, find it a bit too long. Don't bother with reviewing chapters on this one. The menu has sub-menus, and it's very easy to get lost in there. My suggestion: just push play and go with it! Good luck, and drink plenty of caffine before you enjoy this DVD!!!",1077580800,6,686,4.244274809160306
1850325,5,B00008L3WX,"(See my review of Volume I)  I enjoyed the first NYCBW so much that I got Vol. 2 shortly after its release.  Basically, it's Volume 1 at a faster pace, contains corrected technical glitches from its predecessor, and has a couple of new exercises not found in Vol. 1.  I also believe that anyone in some semblance of physical shape can do the exercises in this volume.  One thing I really appreciate is the dancers mirroring your movements.  For example, when you're instructed to move your left leg, the dancers move their right legs because they are facing you.  Nice touch.
The content is well-balanced and well-paced.  I don't have a problem making time for a nearly one hour workout.  The dancers are superb once again.  There are more features contained in Volume 2 than the first volume.  But I don't know if I'll ever get the Balanchine dance at the end!  They make it look so easy.  A little bit at a time, perhaps, and I should have it down in a year.
Anyway, I mentioned NYCBW to a friend.  She purchased Vol. 2 and was glad she did.  If this type of workout is new to you, I suggest getting the routine in Volume I down first before Volume 2.  Experienced dancers can obviously get right into this volume.
These workouts are educational, too, in that you learn the names of particular ballet steps and poses, thanks to the video glossary included.  It gives you a greater appreciation of the art form.  Athletes from a variety of sports would find this program beneficial, even football players.  It helps with coordination, posture, and balance, among other things.
I do the workout three times a week and has given me noticeable results in strength, stamina, toning, and posture.",1074556800,41,1692,4.620805369127517
1850326,4,B00008L3WX,"After trying this video twice, I've basically got the steps down and can keep up with the dancers without constantly stumbling about. I have no prior experience with ballet but I still didn't find the video too fast or daunting for an absolute beginner (with very little practice). Watching it for the first time, I couldn't keep up, so I would rewind the video watch the move one more time, pause, and then try the steps on my own with my own pace. By the second time watching it, as I mentioned above, it took little effort to keep up. But, this is omitting the dance combonation at the end - I'm completely lost here!
There is only one complaint that I have about this video, there could be more instructions involved during the excercises and a bigger glossary at the end.
The video is great for those who want to improve flexability and posture (it's amazing how after going through the workout you still maintain the posture) and for those who are not looking for a cardio workout and fast music to workout to.
If you enjoy the idea of dancing/ballet and want to actually feel relaxed and good after working out -  this is the video for you!",1073433600,27,1147,4.461904761904762
1850327,4,B00008L3WX,"I bought this with the NYC Ballet Workout Vol. 1.  Don't buy both, they are very similar and buying both is really a waste of money.  I am a HS/MS music teacher, and I was very satisfied with some portions of this and very unsatisfied with others.  I may be a musician, but I am a HORRIBLE dancer.  I was relieved to find out that you don't have to be very coordinated to to do the regular workout (which is much better than the original...better descriptions, better use of tracking and sections, a glossary of ballet terms for the dancing impaired, etc.)  However, the cardio dance routine at the end is a disaster.  The dancers don't ""teach"" anything....they just show the movements without breaking them down, and you are expected to pick them up.  They also don't do a very good job of showing you how many times you are going to be doing a particular step.  If I was trying to teach my marching band this way, they would be running into each other on the field.  One other downer, it is very long.  The basic workout is about 1 hour, and if you want to do the cardio as well, you are looking at about 1 hour and twenty minutes.  I do like the slow methodical way that muscles are built though, and it does work. even my husband noticed that my legs looked alot better!!",1066348800,27,1275,4.315126050420168
