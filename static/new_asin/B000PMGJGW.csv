8192657,5,B000PMGJGW,"Excellent film for incorporating the Bible into an adventure - with classic good and evil struggles.  The Fibbler, the bad guy, might be a little scary for younger children (ages 3 - 5), but otherwise the movie is appropriate for any age - our 7-year-old granddaughter is captivated by it!  Scripture is a central focus of all of the Bibleman stories and as our granddaughter noted - ""this movie has lessons in it!""  Recommended!",1370390400,,429,4.77027027027027
