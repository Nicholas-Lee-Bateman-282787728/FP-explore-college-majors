4701934,5,B005HK13SQ,Worth every penny.  The chemistry captured in this video is timeless.  I'm sure there were better concerts out there but this is another great moment in time preserved.,1325721600,5,168,4.964285714285714
4701935,5,B005HK13SQ,"Can't add much to what has been said, but this has Women Do Know How To Carry On, which to my knowledge is not on any live Waylon recordings or videos, bootleg or commercial.",1323820800,20,174,4.147058823529412
4701936,5,B005HK13SQ,"I'm a huge Waylon fan and I am always looking for anything Waylon that I don't have.  I picked up this and don't regret it.  It is cool to see Waylon playing in a festival session, I don't have any other Waylon videos where he is playing in the daytime.  the first Two songs have some errors in sound and video but they seem to get in under control and the rest of show is good quality.  There is a interview with Waylon before the show that gives you a look at Waylon during a time that he was obviously abusing some heavy substances.  If you are a Waylon collector this is a great addition.",1323561600,31,592,4.113043478260869
4701937,5,B005HK13SQ,"Not much more needs to be said about this concert dvd other than:  Willie Nelson, in what appear to be black sweat pants, playing the hell out of Trigger on an 8 minute jam-laden version of Bloody Mary Morning. This is Willie and Family at the top of their game, folks.  A must-have for any Willie fan.",1321747200,3,302,4.280701754385965
4701938,5,B005HK13SQ,"This is an absolutely fantastic show -- the set list is perfect and Waylon is in top form. The interplay with the band (and with Jessie when she comes on stage) is amazing as well. Like the amazing Waylon Live album from 76, this shows everything that made him great. There are a few video glitches, but this is such a fantastic set that you have to overlook them. Fans need it, but it's also a perfect introduction to Waylon Jennings, better than any ""greatest hits"" record could do.",1319500800,25,484,4.449438202247191
4701939,5,B005HK13SQ,"I haven't received it yet, but I went ahead & gave it a 5 star. I have tons of Waymore & enjoy every one of his cd's & dvd's. I know this will be awesome he hasn't steered me wrong yet, & I've been listening to the Hoss since early 70's. Hey Amazon soon as ya receive this, don't forget me. Thanks, Rich!! If it's live, it gots ta be good!!!",1316908800,6,341,3.816901408450704

4701964,5,B005HK13SQ,"When I was 17 I used to see Waylon close the show at JD's in Scottsdale, AZ.  I got in because a lady friend would tell the bouncer I was her husband.  Always been a great fan.  The US Festival shows Waylon's stage appearance and how great he was as an entertainer, musician, singer and person.

If you are a Waylon fan, you will enjoy this DVD.

4701965,5,B005HK13SQ,Nobody ever gave me the listening pleasure that Waylon did.  I listen to him continually and have a large collection of his music that I would gladly build on if there are any more re-releases of his early day cuts.,1379980800,,215,4.375
4701966,5,B005HK13SQ,"The quality of this DVD is very good.  It shows Waylon in his outlaw prime.  I love Waylon Jennings so seeing him in mid-1983 and knowing that in June of 1984 he kicks his cocaine habit made seeing this video very special.  Even in the height of his addiction he was performing and doing an admirable job.  I loved the entire video and kept wishing the camera would pan around to whatever he was doing when Mooney's hands were being shown.  The band is great and so was he.  He and Jessi are so in love and she was such a marvelous influence..without her, I'm sure he would have continued drugging right up to the end.  As it is, they had 18 wonderful years after.  I liked him as the outlaw with the long hair and hat.  He was so special!  I read his autobiography and learned just how special he really was.  There'll never be another Waylon! If you like country mu8sic, you've got to get this DVD.",1369440000,7,900,4.266272189349112
4701967,4,B005HK13SQ,"Mistakes and all Waylon delivered what the audience had come to see,a non stop show of real country music and having Jessi on stage really made it for me. This is a DVD every fan of his should have.",1363478400,,198,4.102564102564102
4701968,5,B005HK13SQ,Great performance and good quality . A great honest talent that did not pretend to be something he was not.  I never realize how good he was till after he death even though I saw him before the seventies.,1362268800,,204,4.230769230769231

4701980,5,B005HK13SQ,This is one of Waylon's better performances...his backing band is spot on! About halfway through the show he invites his wife Jessi Colter to come out and sing a song...they sound great together...this is a must own for any true fan,1358380800,,232,4.682926829268292
4701981,5,B005HK13SQ,"We all love Waylon Jennings, great to be able to watch and listen to him perform, would recommend to any of his fans",1354492800,,116,4.086956521739131
4701982,5,B005HK13SQ,This DVD keeps Waylon alive in my home. I love it. Waylon is so fun to watch. He plays with his audience and makes me feel like he is singing to me alone.,1353888000,,154,3.696969696969697
4701983,4,B005HK13SQ,"as for Waylon, he gives a GREAT steller concert, he gets 5 stars easy. But the DVD, for this to have came out in late 2011, there is no excuse not to remix the audio in 5.1....I'm not even sure this is a stereo mix! I heard no stereo separation in my speakers. What a shame! This DVD could have been the BEST DVD ever for Waylon. The Picture quality is 5 stars, very crisp and clear! The show was performed just  few hours before dawn and it looks great, you can see the landscape and all the fans out there, was a huge concert! This is still a MUST OWN DVD for any Waylon fan, just wish they took the audio and remixed in 5.1 but beggars cant be choosy I guess. The Best DVD out there for Waylon (in my opinion)is Waylon Live from Austin 1989.",1348876800,3,744,4.027027027027027

4701985,4,B005HK13SQ,"Once again Waylon Prooves himself as a Great Artist, his music will live on forever, thanks to dvd's it's a shame he didn't live a long life, it's nice to watch him in action, on this dvd.",1338163200,,188,4.108108108108108
4701986,5,B005HK13SQ,"I enjoyed this dvd performance. It has found a place in my Waylon dvd collection. He was great on stage during this performance. Waylon was so unique and was the epitome of one being ""tru to his music."" He really had no musical boundaries, he was great and just loved a good song. This concert was shortly before Waylon beat some demons on his own, proving again the will and strength of this man. I particularly like the fact that a lot of his early 80's songs are on the list, as some of them now are hard to find. Waylon was the best and his music and legacy continues on.",1334275200,10,575,4.1891891891891895

8473165,2,B005HK13SQ,It shows that I should have received two CD's but I only received the Willie Nelson CD. I was kind of disappointed!!!,1497052800,,117,4.363636363636363
8473166,4,B005HK13SQ,"I attended a Waylon Jennings outdoor concert at about the same time this recording was made in 1983. I was only able to get a bench seat in one of the back rows of the crowd. But I was hopeful Id get a good view  because I had brought binoculars. However, early in the performance, the man in front of me asked to borrow my binoculars. I saw them pass away from me out of sight from there, being handed off from one fan to another.

Miraculously, the binoculars circulated back to me  but only at the tail-end of the concert. So I missed my close-up view of almost all of the performance. But this DVD makes up for my loss all those years ago. This DVD provides the best of actually having been there.

The sound isn't as engineered to perfection as youd find on a record or remastered CD. But its very good. In addition, you get great views of Jennings and his band members up close and personal, including a few revealing shots looking forward from the back of the stage.

My one disappointment with this video is that it seems to have been made a few years past the point when Jennings was at the height of his enthusiasm for the music he was making. On video snippets Ive seen made a little earlier, he radiates more good humor and outright joy in the process. Here, he seems to be more doggedly going through the motions  with a bit of a Lets get through this gig and get on to the next attitude.

However, Jennings is still in excellent voice and he still manages to do justice to the 22 songs he sings. I doubt that he ever gave a bad performance or a performance that wasn't worth attending. With this DVD, you too will get to see all the action you might have missed if you had actually been there  without binoculars.",1494288000,,1727,4.259938837920489
