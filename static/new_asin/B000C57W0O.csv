2452866,1,B000C57W0O,"I had just purchased the OMG Tour on Blu-Ray and was surprised when I saw the Truth Tour was available on Blu-Ray as well, except this is not a blu-ray at all but rather the 3 DVD set that I already own.  Description needs to be updated ASAP.",1320710400,,242,4.041666666666667
2452867,1,B000C57W0O,"I bought this DVD for only 21.99 (on sale) and even that was too much.  His last DVD in Concert was much better.  I expected the same, but this DVD did not deliver.  The 2 bonus disks are worthless and boring.",1134432000,3,209,4.048780487804878
2452868,4,B000C57W0O,"First off, I am a big fan of concert DVDs because of the way you can play them and choose to ignore them (say in the background of a party or while you're doing chores), and they will still be instantly engaging.  I'm also a big fan of R&B, though less so with Top 40 R&B.

That being said, Usher's Truth Concert is spectacular.  Easily my favorite concert DVD in my collection.  On a visual level, the effects and lighting are amazing, and Usher's performance is highly entertaining.  The dancers are exciting to watch, and the overall visuals of the concert are wildly colorful and eye-popping... All of it is shot with amazing clarity and quality, and the select an angle segments offer a nice bit of replay value.

As far as the sound goes, I was fairly impressed with the musical arrangements, and even impressed with Usher's vocal talent, although he barely gets to show it off in this performance, because there are times when he chooses to breathe/let the audience sing for many of his song's most challenging notes.  This I think is largely due to the fact that his dancing is aggressive and competing for the air in his lungs.  Still, it's a bit disappointing to hear Usher cheat his way through the more exciting parts of his songs.  Oh, and it may be my system, but the DTS track on this disc just plain sucks!  Possibly even worse than the 2.0 Stereo track.  Sadly, the best sound you will get is a passable 5.1 track that you will need to blast to truly enjoy.

And why oh why did they put the last song of the concert on a seperate disc?????  I know it's the encore performance, but it's the true finale to the concert and having to switch discs for just one more song is a complete pain, as it really is a great finale.

As far as his interviews and documentaries, I've watched almost none of them.  I personally don't care to see them, so to me the first disc is useless.  (fortunately, the concert portion of the DVD set justifies the amount I paid for it) I find that Usher is only worth watching while he's performing on stage.  Usher as a person (and especially as an actor) is just simply not at all interesting.  Therefor I couldn't offer you an opinion on any of the ""Behind The Truth"" material, and honestly I couldn't care.

Bottom line: There's mostly only one disc that's worth it out of the 3, but on sale, the concert disc would be worth the price of admission.",1133654400,3,2391,4.405466970387244
2452869,2,B000C57W0O,"Ok now when I think Usher I think ABS! I think Chest! I think great dancing. When I watched this concert I got nothing. For anybody out there who was hoping to see him like he his in his videos, you are out of luck. This was horrible. If you want to hear the songs listen to the cd. He takes of his shirt ONCE!! the dancing was mediocre. Try out the 8701 concert it's hot, or better yet try out the Michael Jackson Bucharest concert and get the originator instead of the imitator. Don't waste your money on this, Unless you are a die hard fan.",1133308800,7,543,4.08411214953271
2452870,5,B000C57W0O,"skip MJ.  If you're the slightest fan of Usher maybe even like one or two songs he's ever done you need to get this set.  It's better than his 8701 tour dvd and that was an awesome dvd as well.  I got mine from best buy and theirs interactive camera angles during the concert portion and a documentary ""you think you know but you have no idea"" type mtv bit to what his days consists of on the first disc.  His dance moves are incredible and really.....you just need to get it.  replay value is high.  I've only watched 8701 a few times. must buy.",1133222400,5,546,4.152380952380953

8095707,4,B000C57W0O,"The concert was wonderful, great songs, great staging, great dancers.  I just missed some of the songs! I was kinda disappointed because I wanted Usher to really sing ALL the words of ALL the songs.  He often held out the microphone to the audience for them to sing along, or for him.  I am sure that was fun for the concert goers, but I wanted to see HIM sing and dance his socks off!  It is a great price and I would not hesitate buying it again.",1366588800,,448,4.114942528735632
