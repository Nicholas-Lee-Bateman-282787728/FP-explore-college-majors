785149,3,6304111282,"Right from the start of the titles you know this film has high production values. The visuals are quite rivetting backed by John Lewis' orchestrations.  The film is based on (then) hot cop shop writer McGivern who also wrote THE BIG HEAT. The dialogue is crisp and witty and philosophical. The photography stylish with much of it shot on location;  Add to this Mr Ryan playing an ageing ofay tortured racist ex-vet killer; Mr Begley a larger than life ex-cop out to make the one big score; Mr Belafonte cool black boy racist ex-vet; plus a gaggle of hot women including Gloria (just this once) Grahame; plus some fast cars; plus some cool jazz and a nice blues vocal from Mr Belafonte; plus a theme or two eg, racist hatred will surely have an apocalyptic end, or, when we're dead, your can't tell one man from another.  Yet, it doesn't quite come off - maybe because of its didactism.  Still, it's worth a look, but do not expect to be either thrilled or otherwise moved by it.

785150,5,6304111282,"Excellent, hardbitten crime drama brilliantly directed by Robert Wise about three men planning a bank robbery. Ex-cop Burke (Ed Begley) recruits bitter, aging racist Earl Slater (Robert Ryan) and urban jazz muscian/singer Johnny Ingram (Harry Belafonte) for the big heist. The money will change and better all of their lives for different reasons. Ingram especially, as he's indebted to a brutal gangster with his gambling debts. Burke is hopelessly enthusiastic but Slater and Ingram are skeptical and don't trust each other because of Slater's blatant racism towards Ingram.  As the tension of the planning of the robbery mounts, so does the antagonism between the two men. That such ignorance should exist between people who have the same goal is intelligently played out with a realistic script. Belafonte, Ryan and Begley give convincing performances as do Shelley Winters, Gloria Grahame and Kim Hamilton as the women in Slater's and Ingram's lives. Haunting b&w photography expresses the bleak and depressing world of the men and the individual anxieties experienced by each. A smoky jazz club, stark city streets, cramped apartments, the stares of strangers---all contribute to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film. The tense, moody jazz score underlies the tense feeling that something is going to go horribly wrong. When it does, the brewing hatred between Slater and Ingram finally and (literally) explodes.  Don't miss this exciting film if you like good, gritty adult noir crime dramas. The DVD is a good print and you can't beat the price.",1070496000,25,1558,5.303643724696356
785151,5,6304111282,"Odds Against Tomorrow is arguably the final entry in the ""film noir"" genre, filmed in exquisite shades of gray and black that underscore its truly dark tale of bigotry and class alienation.
Ryan scores again in his corrosive portrait of a loser from the South strapped with Dust Bowl angst, able abetted by director Robert Wise. Wise, lest we forget, directed Ryan ten years earlier in The Set-up, another classic entry that is now compared with Raging Bull as the best film about boxing.
Ryan allied himself with Wise because the two shared the same ethical belief systems: both were avowed Liberals, and both were committed to making films that not only had a message but which also bore a distinct artistic imprint: from cinematographer John Alton's subtle exploration of black and white film to his daring use of infrared film in the film's opening minutes; to Abraham Polonsky's stark screenplay of desperate people living on the edge, Odds Against Tomorrow achieves its goals in a grim, humorless expose that indicts greed and prejudice. Holding the film firmly in his grasp, Ryan proves again that his acting skills traverse the origins of his psychopathy in a spine-chilling tour de force. Reprising his disturbing portrayal of the cagey, Jew-hating bigot in Crossfire, his role as the loser Earl Slater in Odds Against Tomorrow allows for more complexity to explain his motivations.
Besides Ryan, ""noir"" stalwarts Ed Begley and Gloria Grahame elevate the film considerably. Grahame, as many ""noir"" aficianados are aware, was also featured in Crossfire, achieving fame as one of filmdom's ""noir"" females, duplicitous, alienated and jaded. Ed Begley turns in another realistic portrait as the disgraced ex-cop with an axe to grind, while Harry Belafonte's down-on-his-luck gambler emerges as a man afflicted with a gambling addiction that covers up his deep insecurities. Viewers should also take note that the film is chock full of secondary players, including a very young Cicely Tyson and Wayne Rogers, along with character actors, Will Kuluva, Lew Gallo, Richard Bright (possibly the first depiction of homosexuality in the cinema), and William Zuckert. The score by the Modern Jazz Quartet is aptly spare, underscoring the grim tale. Finally, observant viewers may notice that the nightclub bouncer who lends Belafonte a pistol in a smoky Harlem nightclub bares a striking resemblance to James Earl Jones (in fact it is his brother, Robert Earl Jones). Kudos to all involved in this ""noir"" masterpiece.",1050796800,5,2514,5.194581280788177
785152,4,6304111282,"Prior reviews of this movie (see below) cover its style and substance very well, so I won't attempt to duplicate their efforts. I will only add that while this is a fine film, it moves excruciatingly slowly by today's standards. So if you're expecting fast-paced action, this isn't the movie for you. The pacing and style -- and even the ""twist"" ending -- reminded me of the old ""Twilight Zone,"" which was produced in the same era. It's not too far off the mark to think of this as a triple-length TZ episode! Worth noting, however, is the great moody soundtrack featuring the Modern Jazz Quartet.

785153,5,6304111282,"Director Robert Wise is probably most identified with his two Oscar  winning musicals West Side Story and The Sound of Music.  Wise's Odds  Against Tomorrow, a 1959 film produced at the end of the noir cycle, should  have earned him his first Oscar.  Unfortunately that year, Ben Hur's  unprecedented eleven Academy Awards left little in the wake of cinematic  honors.  Odds Against Tomorrow may have been slighted by the Academy and  the box office, but it unassumingly remains as one of the first films to  address racism towards blacks in American society.  Wise's casting of  African American Harry Belafonte as jazz musician Johnny Ingram and Robert  Ryan as the bigot Earl Slater revealed the racial tensions that marked the  social undercurrent of the 1950's. Odds Against Tomorrow may have been an  emblematic precursor to the racial violence that exploded into the  consciousness of mainstream America during the 1960's.  The film's plot is  structured around a planned bank hiest involving a retired police officer  Dave Burke  (Ed Begley), a gambling night club singer,Johnny and a  psychotic loner Earl. The three protagonists are drawn together for the  lure of money; each thinking that a lucrative monetary score will dissolve  their personal demons.  Unlike other noir films their well devised plan  unravels from within.  Earl's seething malevolence and resentment towards  Johnny causes the caper to disintegrate.  James Coburn deservedly won an  Oscar for his role as an alcoholic, abusive father in Affliction; Ryan's  portrayal of an emotionally unstable, violent racist is equally noteworthy.  Noir critics often cite Richard Widmark's screen roles as Tommy Udo and  Alec Stiles as the most paranoid psychotics to shock American morality, but  it is Ryan who with only a cold silent stare or a few callous words could  bring buried hatred to a bubling boil. In Odds Against Tomorrow, Ryan's  scenes in the tavern, elevator, and gas station deliver convincing glimpses  into the tormented mind of a dangerous man.  Shelly Winters is cast as the  insecure loner who desperately smothers Earl with love that is not  returned. Gloria Grahame appears as the strange apartment neighbor who  inexplicably is drawn to the abusive Earl.  Wise craftfully places  characters in scenes that drip with realism.  The mob boss, the homosexual  henchman, the bartender, the black elevator operator, and Johnny's  estranged wife, create a multi-dimensional atmosphere that does not  distract from the flow of events.  Wise's  extraordinary camera work  allows viewers quick angle frames of hallways, city streets,  highways, and  city complexes. An opening shot of a desolate city street corner, marked  only by a fire hydrant that is suddenly invaded by windswept newspaper is  chilling. Wise is not adverse to draw his camera away from city settings  where noir scenery could easily be captured.  Instead he mixes urban  concrete and smokey club interiors with panned shots of cold November  landscapes and highways dotted with leafless trees. Wise also incorporates  the contrast of day and night into the climax of the picture.  Not  constrained within the limits of shadows, darkness, and night which  characterize most noir films; Wise utilizes the impending nightfall as a  scenic metaphor for the doomed hiest.  Odds Against Tomorrow is one of the  greatest noir pictures ever made. It may have well been the last true noir  film.",960249600,3,3443,5.245841035120148

785297,4,6304111282,"In Melton, in upstate New York, on Thursday evenings, a waiter habitually slips over to the side door of the 1st National Bank and drops off his delivery of coffee and sandwiches. Thursday is payroll day and also when the deposits from the stores come in, meaning there's routinely $200,000 in untraceable cash floating around in 1st National being sorted by a small staff of stay-late clerks. A would-be mastermind's picked up on this routine, and he sees that side door as the entry point for a heist he's hatching up, if only he could convince two other ne'er-do-wells to throw in with him.

The two accomplices he's eyeing are tricky birds. Earle Slater (Robert Ryan) is an ex-con, one of them hard men who's mad at the world and who's been waiting for his big break all his life without doing anything to help along that big break. For having dished out brutality in excess, he's done two stretches. Oh, yeah, and he's racist.

Makes you wonder what the heck dirty ex-cop David Burke (Ed Begley) was thinking, making his pitch to Slater and then to Johnny Ingram (Harry Belafonte), a nightclub singer but also, regretably, a gambler down on his luck. Johnny owes $7,500 and he's just made the bonehead mistake of pulling a gun on the shark what he owes money to. So now he's got until tomorrow night at 8pm to fork over the whole wad or it's curtains.

Both Slater and Ingram initially want no part of Burke's caper, but one's restless need to make good and the other's dire circumstance at last convince them to throw in. So this is a noir thriller, but also a fascinating character study. Robert Wise's taut direction draws charged performances from Ryan and Belafonte, and, really, their heated interplay is what drives the narrative. See, we know how angry Slater is. But Johnny Ingram himself nurses a short fuse. As for Ed Begley, the old actor channels his inner Willy Loman to construct a character who thinks he's got the angles worked out and who's pinned all his hopes on one big score only to- well, watch the movie.

Rounding out the cast, Shelley Winters and Gloria Grahame have small but important roles as, respectively, Slater's faithful girl and their flirty neighbor.

In his time Robert Wise tried his hand at noir cinema. I think it's a toss-up as to which is better: this one or 1949's THE SET-UP which features a more sympathetic Robert Ryan. 1959's ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW drives home a tutorial on the doomed futility of the perfect heist, ratchets up racial tensions, introduces characters whose seeds of self-destruction had already been laid in even before we meet them. There's the moody jazz score to punctuate the noir atmosphere and, in the nightclub scene, there's Belafonte himself pounding on the xylophone and snarling out the bluesy ""My Baby's Not Around."" Burke caps off his pitch job to Slater with this remark: ""I want a serious guy in trouble, and that's you, that's me, that's the both of us."" By the end of the film, nothing'll have changed. It's film noir, after all. Say hello to bleakness and to fatality.",1378857600,,3054,4.711610486891386

785300,4,6304111282,"One of the last black and white film noir productions that painted big cities as crime infested traps to nowhere, Odds Against Tomorrow matches 3 desperate down and outers willing to compromise. Robert Ryan is an unemployed ex-con with a wife (Shelley Winters) who tells him, ""you're old now"" and Harry Belafonte a musician deep in gambling debts. Disgraced ex-cop Ed Begley talks them into a ""sure thing"" -- holding up a bank when lots of smaller denomination untraceable bills are being processed.
The film is a study of each. Ryan's character's dislike of blacks builds slowly into hatred; Belafonte's character's addiction to gambling unravels his life bit by bit; and Begley's character's thirst for evening the score becomes worse than one who has not had liquids for a few days. Unique for film noir, in that the characters are not easily pegged as evil or good. Rather, they are basically good men sucked into evil because of weak wills.
The sequence of Belafonte playing a vibraphone and singing as he fronts a jazz band and his nemesis walking in is classic. Little is said but the feeling of doom is thick.",1360540800,,1117,4.822916666666667

785372,5,6304111282,"He's just got to be one of the best actors of his time, and Earl Slater just may be his best role ever. It's the meatiest, most complex role in the film and I can't see anyone but Ryan pulling it off. Yes, he's a racist, bigot, yet we see how comfortable he is with his prejudice in his early encounter with the little black girl, a key scene to Slater's psyche, as is the elevator ride which immediately follows. His attitude toward women and relationships could use some work as well. So even though he's bigoted, his mental illness spans several levels, including male, as well as race, superiority. And Robert Ryan, with all the mental tics leftover from BEWARE MY LOVELY, should have garnered an Academy Award nomination here. His scene with Wayne Rogers in a bar is priceless. This is one confused, embittered character, hanging onto life and sanity and even the demise of classic Film Noir, before such a thing was ever known.

As for the film itself, I won't give anything away. It's a heist plot devised by an vengeful ex-cop wonderfully played by Ed Begley. Along with Ryan's Slater Begley cuts in Johnny Ingram, a smooth nightclub singer up to his !!! in gambling debts. He's likeably played by Harry Belafonte who also turns in a strong performance and could have and should have made far more movies than he did. His is a complex character in his own right, a nice guy, a loving father who just happens to have a bad gambling habit and loves to party and spend money he doesn't have. He agrees to pull the heist in order to save his little daughter and his ex-wife from mob retaliation.

Shelley Winters is great as always as Ryan's long suffering girlfriend who does her best to make him feel like a man, and even Gloria Grahame chimes in a whacky little bit part as the seductive neighbor down the hall in Ryan's appartment complex. But really, it's all Bob Ryan's show here. He steals every scene he's in. ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW may be one of the last great Film Noirs and Ryan holds on as if there were no tomorrow.

BOB RYAN HEADS NORTH PART 2?
He begins the movie deep within the foul inner city and escapes northward for breath of fresh bucolic air and a much needed second chance at life.
This was not the first time...

BOB RYAN HEADS NORTH PART 1 happened a few years earlier. Bob was a hard-bitten punk-beating cop in ON DANGEROUS GROUND, who was sent on assignment north of the foul inner city to escape for the first time to the land of clean snow and hunting caps, to clean up his act (and head), to find some sense of being and redemption. This first time around it worked for him. The second time...well I guess you just can't go home again.

Both ON DANGEROUS GROUND and ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW are sterling examples Film Noir offering great Bob Ryan performances. Watch them both as a double bill on a winter's afternoon rather than shoveling out the driveway. There's a lot to be learned about life here.

The MGM dvd is great. Sharp, clear picture. It's as though you were seeing it in a theater in 1959, maybe even better. I can't recommend this classic enough. Just buy it.",1346457600,3,3105,4.477031802120141

It has great tension, an interesting cast , a plot in which racism is central, and some great and fascinating shots.

Ryan to me, had no business being a part of that heist simply because he had strong feelings against blacks and it was a disaster to the end. To me Begley should have kept on till he got someone who just wanted the dough and wasn't worried on the color of his comrades skin. From the very start of the movie, Ryan is calling a little black girl that accidentally ran into him ""a pickaninny"" setting the tone to what he would bring to the movie. Everything he touched or said just went straight to the toilet. Shelley Winters tries to love him but he resents it and screws that up. Gloria Grahame is sexually attracted to him in spite of the fact she's neighbors and friends to Shelley Winters & Ryan. Yet, the money on this heist will bring him back sort to speak and less dependable on Winters. Then you have Begley. He set up the whole thing, but he picked the wrong horse in Ryan knowing he's a keg about to go off every time he deals with Belafonte. Half the time, he's going between Belafonte & Ryan for some bigoted foolishness Ryan says. Belafonte is a cool guy but he is a terrible gambler and Begley gets the folks that Belafonte owes to put the screws on him so that he could join up on the deal. What should have been a simple heist turns into a disaster for all men and in the end, no one wins. the most ironic thing at the end of it all is that at the end of movie, the cops couldn't distinguish as to who was who. the lesson was there right before you but if you couldn't pick it up, you just couldn't see it. great movie.",1331251200,,1790,4.252199413489736
785375,3,6304111282,"Odds Against Tomorrow, 1959 film

The movie starts with a water-filled gutter in New York midtown. A man enters the Hotel Juno. Elevators have operators. Slater is on time. Burke was on the force thirty years until he was made a patsy and did a year for contempt (he wouldn't talk). Burke wants a man with guts who isn't known. Another man visits Burke. Ingram needs money for gambling debts. ""Its easy money"" says Burke. [Note the few locks on his door, and the lack of traffic on the streets!] Burke meets Bacco, they talk. Dave Burke visits Earl Slater. The city of ""Melton"" is 100 miles up the Hudson. Burke and Slater watch the bank's operations. The bank has over $200,000 in deposits on Thursday night for Friday's payrolls. It is not well-guarded (compared to NY city). Johnny Ingram sings at a nightclub. Bacco comes in for his money. Johnny doesn't have it. Pay or die? Johnny calls Burke to make that deal. We see how things work.

Boys pop a balloon. There is conflict in a bar. ""I didn't mean to hurt him."" ""You are old now"" says Laura. Earl calls Burke. Johnny tells Rose he will go away ""for a few days"". She hopes for a better world. Earl has a visit from a neighbor. ""How did you feel when you killed that man?"" ""I enjoyed it."" Earl closes his door for his visitor. Burke plans the robbery carefully; they must work together. Johnny solves the problem of the chain on the door. Laura cries, Earl comforts her. Burke has an old station wagon with a souped-up engine. Men carry guns in upstate NY. Johnny rides the bus to Melton. An accident brings a cop around. Three men meet by the railroad tracks on the edge of town. ""Its gonna work."" They wait for evening. The sun sets, its time to go to work. Note how they work on schedule. Tension when the door isn't opened right away! [Note how the men dress to fit into small town culture.]

They force their way into the bank and tell the clerks to sit still. The cash goes into a deep bag. The real waiter knocks on the door. A cop notices something funny and investigates. The alarm goes off, shots are fired. Dave is hit, he has the keys to the car. [Only one pair?] More police arrive to surround the bank. Johnny and Earl fight among themselves while the police gather around them. They have no place to run to. Shooting by a gas tank results in an explosion. ""Which is which?"" ""Take your pick."" It's a dead end.

This is slow-moving while it builds up its characters and background. It shows life in the late 1950s. Usually these crime stories show a successful caper where the conflict arises over splitting the loot, as in ""The Asphalt Jungle"". While a plan may be perfect, you need to improvise when there is a hitch. The robbers couldn't do that when somebody noticed an unusual occurrence that was implicit in their plan. You see a young Wayne Rogers as the soldier in the bar. Was the fictional ""Melton"" really Hudson NY? It is a river city with a reputation, a whaling port in the 19th century. Whaling ships recruited farm boys who wanted to earn a stake. ""Two Years Before the Mast"" has a few paragraphs about this.",1329091200,,3092,4.428822495606327

785377,5,6304111282,"Odds Against Tomorrow (OAT) is only nominally about racism, though it does confront it's reality. What OAT is really about is the existential facts and fate each of these men chose, and were cast into, as a result of their past actions. Wise's directing and cinematography serve to cement, in as little time and space possible, both the chilling and human reality of what this means for each of the protagonists. The noir effects are obvious, but it is the existential drama portrayed in the cinematography that clinches both the sparseness, drama, barreness and yes, human warmth each is offered but rejects in realizing their fate. Begley's life (I will use the actor's names for ease of presentation) with his dog, barren as it seems, opens to a room that gives him all he really needs, if he will accept it, like all of us, but won't. Ryan's insurmountable frustration and rage are countered by Winter's actual love, warmth and understanding, that pierces even his hardened hearts pain, as he tellingly reveals. The psychological depth of her character, the dialogue, and the human level of portrayal of her scenes with him are everything good film-making is about, which is completely missing in contemporary American film. Belafonte's character is one of real talent and ability, on screen and off, that never achieves its full potential in this character for his lacking personal habits. But again, he, like all the rest, is offered redemption for his past and present actions, as portrayed in his wife, if he will only accept it, which he foolishly chooses to opt out of. And of all the characters in the film, his has the most to offer those around him if he will, which he doesn't. In one sense all three are American protagonist's who want to be larger and better than the world around them, but are forced out of personal circumstance and cultural reality to live roles in life far less rewarding than their actual potential. Even Ryan's character, who is as racist and rigid as can be, has redeeming qualities of resourcefulness and energy if he would only use them positively, rather than negatively, e.g., the skill of his automobile engineering. Begly has a lifetime of experience that could be positively accepted by himself, if he'd allow it, to benefit others, but instead is consumed with ""getting even"" for his police betrayal. And Belafonte's real feelings towards his wife and child reveal a deep appreciation of love for them, he endeavors to carry with his child, but stumbles with his wife. Yet again, she offers him the opportunity, revealing her conflicted ""push-pull"" feelings towards him also, because of her past vis-a-vis her pregnancy with him--a mutual obligation. In conclusion all three suffer from the chronic feature of fate, typical of noir, that comes to haunt them in everything they do. Even the bank heist is a positive, though criminal attempt to overcome their pasts, which backfires. Winter was the perfect season to make this film, for its stark clarity, but also for the telling details of breath vapor, crystalline light and clear long-distance panoramas. The shots in the country, the most telling for this viewer, offer a perceptual and physical opportunity for redemption that the characters confined city lives could never offer, which are suitably lost again, within the confines of yet another smaller town, i.e., space. All in all, OAT is a superb example of human drama on a human scale that does nothing to negate the quality of the film or of its characters in its portrayal. The ending was, if one can denote it as such, the weakest point in the film, save for the grace comment of ""which one is which,"" concluding the real point of the entire film. That all three men, in spite of their social differences, faced the same existential opportunities, problems and outomes all of us face in our own personal dramas. Watch OAT for its superb casting, nuanced bitter/warm dialogue, it's human-scale portrayal, and for its clear brilliant B & W cinematography. As a caveat, the Modern Jazz Quartet's presence and score is a telling reminder of a time in American life when creative energy was abounding, and opportunity still available for all, regardless of rank. No more. Enjoy. GJC",1276387200,,4239,4.921787709497207
785378,5,6304111282,"Oftenly sited as the last film noir picture along with TOUCH OF EVIL. Not only that, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW is arguably one of the finest films noir of all time. It also should have recognized as one of the best films of director, Robert Wise. For this one, Wise took a job of producer to make sure that the whole thing would be HIS FILM.

As a dedicated film craftsman, Wise always was innovative making his films great, and made them quite memorable. His ingenuity particularly reflected strongly on ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW. Beautiful quality B&W photography is still astonishing today, sharp editing is stunning, use of John Lewis' jazz score is entirely artistic, and the characters' mood is perfectly suited to lead us into a grim, nihilistic, yet a very poetic noir environment.

785379,5,6304111282,"What a brilliant, dreary, and heavy film. I finally saw it this evening... after years of wanting to see it, i finally added another great film noir jewel to my collection.

Some reviewers say this is a film soaked with racial and social commentary, others say this is a jazz music-mood, period piece film, but I understand it to be much more than those minor, typical observations. Odds against tomorrow is about three men from three different generations, who are desperate for money reluctantly coming together for one big score that could set them straight. Yes, the racist character of the great Robert Ryan, and Harry Belafonte's character posturing at each other with anger and hostility definitely oils the gears of the plot, but I sensed the real depth lay in the bleakness of all three men's desperation and turmoil of their daily existence. It's a heist movie,  a hold-up, quite realistic in fact, that it seemed that this could very well happen or be based on true events.

All of the actors were brilliant,and especially Ed Begley as the older man who did all he could to really make it happen, pleading with Ryan and Belafonte, to do the job. The New York City, and upstate landscapes and cinematography were superb. This is a film noir by all means, and of course the social commentary is relevant, but I ask you to look deeper into the three main characters agonies to really grasp the power of the film. The mood of this film is priceless, It is so saddening that films today lack the atmosphere of these black and white treasures.

Peace.

P.S. I believe that the woman behind the bar in the jazz club is a young Cicely Tyson.

UPDATE: A few years back I drove up to Hudson NY where the movie was filmed. The town is merely a shell of what the bustling downtown ""Melton"" NY looked like in the film, but the bank with the infamous side door (the one where Belafonte enters dressed as the diner employee) is still there, and even the little park area where Begley reads the words under the statue still exists. Any folks who are in love with this film as much as I am who live and/or visit the Tri-state area, should drive up to Hudson and connect the film, it's a special experience.

785380,5,6304111282,"ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW is oftenly sited as one of the last film noir together with TOUCH OF EVIL. Sadly, it has been overlooked for years. The critics favored it, but it was unpopular among the public. Nevertheless, because of its creative experiments, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW remains arguably one of the finest film noirs of all time.

The film also should have recognized as the one of the best films of its director, Robert Wise. Wise, always had been an innovative film maker, was successful making many of his films efficiently memorable. His ingenuity was well used for ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW. Joseph Brun's beautiful B&W photography is forcefully astonishing, sharp editing is stunning, use of John Lewis' jazz score is cool, and characters' melancholic mood is perfectly suited to lead us into the grim, nihilistic, yet very poetic noir environment. The technical merits are very high, and not only that, you cannot ignore the artistic value of the film. Wise carefully assembled each scenes with aesthetic compositions and connected the scenes with provocatively irregular, yet breathtakingly dynamic rhythm.

Players were perfectly chosen too. Robert Ryan, Harry Belafonte, Ed Begley, Shelley Winters, and Gloria Grahame are all wonderful. Espesially, Ryan proves himself again as an effecive noir anti-hero as he was in THE SET-UP, ON DANGEROUS GROUND, or INFERNO. He succeeded to inject urgent pain of a troubled man who feels fear, hate, loneliness, and possibly a little hope. Begley is also great. His presence and forceful manner is another key to the films dynamism.

Whole thing is undeniably stylish due to the technical out put and highly professional cinematic senses from whom all concerned. All together, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW should be remembered as one of the most artistic contribution for the film noir genre, as well as one of the masterworks from the great director, Robert Wise.",1266192000,2,1904,5.215686274509804
785463,5,6304111282,"Okay have to say right off best check with other reviewers, consider mine more as a curiosity - most likely I'm incorrect.
From what I've read it's of the ""film noir"" variety and kind of a commentary / theme on racism-which it is and does.

Where I differ, the filming itself threw my whole take on this movie. Kind of like the ""carousel scene"" -the kids in the beginning seem to more circle float in. The facial shots / expressions effects. Other things too lighting and angles with the streets and stuff. Very subtle but pretty interesting effects really added to the movie.

Looked more like an aside jazz take on life than anything ""noir"" or good vs. evil or racism commentary. I love it for that get a kick out of it every time i see it.

BUT - to be on the safe side figure i'm wrong, check other reviews. Treat my review as an idle curiosity, something to try looking for after seeing it a few times. If anyone else sees it great some pretty amazing film work.

Not being a real critic, I can only write of my personal reaction after seeing this movie for the first time in 50 years. Being a jazz buff I bought this movie because John Lewis (of the MJQ) wrote the score which included ""Skatin in Central Park"", and because I remembered it as a good movie and an early use of the zoom lens in movies. I was unaware that it was also considered the last of the Film Noir genre, and I had forgotten Belafonte miming Milt Jackson's vibes solo.
Those elements for which I bought the movie were not nearly as predominant as I remember them, but the movie stood up well in spite of its age, and neither the script nor the acting were cringeworthy. The story moved relentlessly towards its conclusion, and the black and white shots of New York streets added a chill that reinforced my premonition of a disastrous outcome.  I realised that I had forgotten the story.
It is an excellent movie and it stands up well in spite of the years, and does so without the assistance of colour, surround sound, digital enhancement or gratuitous violence.
If my ""review"" is coloured by nostalgia, that is a condition common in those of advanced years and possibly an aid to enjoyment. However I would like to know what younger viewers, seeing it for the first time think of it.",1246492800,3,1451,5.020746887966805

Director Wise and writer Abraham Polonsky add complexity to both characters, detailing the gnarled emotions Slater has for well-meaning girlfriend Lorry (Winters) and sexy upstairs neighbor Helen (Gloria Grahame), while depicting Ingram's barely concealed desperation, as he attempts to revive a marriage that's crumbled due to his gambling habits. It's all downhill from there, as everything goes awry on the day of the job.

785466,4,6304111282,"Watch those early city scenes, they foreshadow a cultural shift then underway. The cool jazz score, the hip sports car, the dominant racial theme-- all suggest the urban chic of the Kennedy years, no longer Eisenhower's small-town middle America. Noir enthusiasts peg this film as the last true noir of the era. Certainly there are the icons: Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame, Ed Begley, and blacklisted scenarist Abraham Polonsky (Force of Evil; Body and Soul). But it's not classic noir. The usual light and shadow give way to a gritty gray look, the calculated result of winter filming. The bleak landscape is heavy with machinery gone to rust, mirroring the desolation of the plotters as they reach for the big score.

Given the talent involved, the results are surprisingly uneven. Gloria Grahame's role is intriguingly kinky, but dangles like a loose appendage-- a favor to someone I suppose, her looks fading now as quickly as her skills in a badly performed part. Belafonte too looks the part, a frustrated yuppie, yet he deadpans his way through the crucial robbery sequence. And whose idea was that final `message"" scene . They should be forced to sit through a hammer blow, the same way as that piece of obviousness slugged the audience. Director Wise's lacklustre pacing doesn't help eirher, draining the film of much needed snap and suspense.

Nonetheless, the film has the great Robert Ryan in a tailor-made part. Who else could smoulder anger or distance alienation better than this gangly near-forgotten performer. The bar scene alone is worth the viewing. Watch the subtle tics flicker across an anguished face as the rage builds. His despairing Old South confederate remains a scary symbol of decades of Jim Crow, not about to give up without a fight. There's also the telling reaction in Begley's apartment after Belafonte comes up with a clever solution. Ryan looks away, the disgust all over a pained visage-- shouldn't it be he, the white man, who solves tricky brain problems. It's just one more frustration for a man emasculated now by a wife earning a living for the two of them. Blacks and women!-- between them, he's dying inside. And underneath it all is the feeling of  ""the natural order betrayed"", a very contemporary grudge that lives on in the likes of call-in radio.

This may not be a very good caper film, nor a very compelling example of film noir. But as a reflection of a society in transition, the powerful sub-texts endure and are well worth a look-see.",1178496000,5,2489,4.890995260663507
785467,3,6304111282,"An ex-cop, a chronic loser, and a lounge singer with a serious gambling problem join forces to commit a crime.  Ed Begley plays the ex-cop, who is also an ex-con and the mastermind of a robbery planned against a bank in a small city in upstate New York.  To pull it off Begley recruits two accomplices.  The first is Robert Ryan, an aging, two-bit hood who views the job as his last, best chance to make a big score.  Presently he's a `kept' man, tenuously attached to Shelley Winters.  The second is Harry Belafonte, a jazz singer whose addiction to the ponies has put him deeply, and dangerously, in debt to Bacco, the local loan shark.

 Robert Wise directed the black-and-white ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW on the mean streets of New York City in 1959.  The movie is appropriately seedy and run-down looking, a quality that is enhanced by the kool jazz scoring of pianist John Lewis.  There's a certain ragged edginess to the look and music which, unfortunately, is undercut when the `message' of the movie hijacks the plot.

 You see, Robert Ryan's character is a racist, Belafonte's character has some tolerance issues of his own, and what looks like a juicy heist movie  loses itself somewhere along the way, forgets about the crime and turns its attention to its two lead characters.  What ought to be five minutes of backstory is brought to the front and consumes most of the movie.  Ryan's wife/girlfriend Shelley Winters has a job - he doesn't - and she has afternoons full of housewife-y tasks for him to do.  One of which she should have kept off the list was having upstairs neighbor Gloria Grahame come knocking when she needs a baby sitter.  Typically Grahame plays the ripely seducible Other Woman, and ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW is not an exception.  I'm not complaining.  Well, not much, anyway.  No actor was better at going from faux charm to sincere menace than Robert Ryan, and Grahame always had a tough fawn quality about her.  Their scenes together are very good, but... they feel false, superficial, and melodramatic. The movie really didn't have to keep telling me the many ways Ryan was a creep. At least Belafonte's character, who we spend roughly the same amount of time with, is more three-dimensional.  Divorced from his wife yet still a devoted and doting father, his intolerance is more subdued, more reactive, and more understandable.

 ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW isn't a bad movie, but it's a little too preachy for my tastes.  I enjoyed it more as an example of the treatment of race relations in the late `50s than anything else.",1146009600,3,2551,4.745454545454545

In the tradition of classic film noir, luck turns against them and they wind up being in way over their heads.  Director Robert Wise uses his black and white photography to great advantage.  The film is fascinating as it shows us the pressures that work on the initially reluctant Ryan and Belafonte to force them into cooperation on the heist.  Unfortunately, this otherwise nearly flawless film becomes too heavy-handed with its anti-racist theme in its final moments.  Still, it's well worth watching.",1134777600,6,693,5.207207207207207
785469,4,6304111282,"""Odds Against Tomorrow"" is based on the novel by William P. McGivern and was adapted for the screen by Abraham Polonsky, who was blacklisted at the time, so he wrote under novelist John O. Killens' name. The film is sometimes cited as the last film noir of the classic era. Moving into the 1960s, it's a crime film with a social agenda. In contrast to film noir, the most striking visual aspect of ""Odds Against Tomorrow"" is that it is white. Joseph Brun's cinematography often includes large areas of white or near-white, which I found unusual for black-and-white cinema and quite beautiful at times. The cinematography also tends to open spaces and wide lenses, avoiding the claustrophobia associated with film noir.

During a cold, windy winter in New York City, ex-cop Dave Burke (Ed Begley) has plotted the heist of a bank in the town of Melton, but he needs 2 men to help him pull it off. He turns to an ex-con named Earle Slater (Robert Ryan) who, like Dave, is frustrated by being penniless so late in life. For the other man, he wants jazz singer and gambler Johnny Ingram (Harry Belafonte) who is up to his eyeballs in debt to a bookie. Earle has never stolen anything in his life, and he at first refuses to work with Johnny because he's black. Johnny won't agree to the job until his bookie threatens him. Eventually one pathetic criminal mastermind and his two reluctant accomplices -who hate each other- set out to rob a bank.

""Odds Against Tomorrow"" is a classic story of fools doing foolish things with predictable results. The film draws attention to the issue of racial bigotry by making Earle an unabashedly racist Southern farm boy, while Johnny is a suave, stylish, middle class man whose gambling habit compels him to deal with unsavory characters. But that is not the film's overriding theme. It's a character drama with three notable performances. Robert Ryan is a more 3-dimensional bigot here than he was in 1947's ""Crossfire"". Earle isn't a bad man, but he's an angry, egotistical hick. Robert Ryan had the extraordinary ability to evoke absolute sympathy or total hatred from his audience. Ed Begley makes his pitiful nice-guy crook sympathetic. Harry Belafonte sings (once), and Johnny is driven to desperation by his own flaws. ""Odds Against Tomorrow"" is a visually interesting film and a picture of doom and gloom among the desperate and criminal, which had become rare at the movies by 1959. No bonus features on the MGM DVD (2003). Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, and French.",1133222400,7,2522,4.822170900692841
785470,4,6304111282,"""Odds Against Tomorrow"" was recommended to me by Netflix, based on some of the other films I rented recently. I had never even heard of the film before but am glad that I saw it.

Dave Burke (Ed Begley, ""12 Angry Men""), a disgraced former cop now living in a dingy one-bedroom apartment, asks Earle Slater (Robert Ryan, ""The Professionals""), a bigoted white Southerner recently moved to New York, to meet him. Earle is anxious to get some money of his own; he doesn't want to depend on his girlfriend (Shelly Winters) for financial support. Dave's plan is to rob a bank in Melton, a small town in upstate New York. He assures Earle that the plan is foolproof, like snatching candy from a baby, and will net each of them at least $50,000. (The film was made in 1958.) Earle doesn't want to have anything to do with it. Dave then meets with the other member of the group, Johnny (Harry Belafonte), a singer with a small jazz group. After hearing the plan, Johnny also passes. But events in the lives of Earle and Johnny conspire against them, forcing them to take part. When they meet, racial conflicts arise threatening the job and their lives.

Directed by Robert Wise (""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""The Sound of Music""), ""Odds Against Tomorrow"" is not really the crime drama it is billed as, which is a surprise and benefits the film greatly. Almost two thirds of the film is about the lives of the two central characters, Earle and Johnny. Because so much time is devoted to them, we really get a sense of who they are, we get to know them, and they become real.

The film was produced by Harbel Productions, a production company owned by Harry Belafonte. It is easy to see why he was so interested in the project. Produced in the late 50s, ""Tomorrow"" uses the story of a bank robbery as a vehicle to tell the tale of two men and their racial conflict. This seems a more effective way of getting the message across; gradually introducing it, creating characters, letting their conflict seep into the storyline. So often, films with `morals' or `messages' make these all encompassing, beating the viewer over the head. Think back to your school days. If a teacher assigned a book like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" to you, it probably felt like you had to struggle through every word. If you discovered it on your own, you probably realized what an outstanding piece of literature it is. The same is true of film, perhaps even more so. If we enjoy the film, the story, the setting, are interested in the characters, we are probably more likely to retain any messages or morals the film might be trying to convey.

Earle is the first person we meet and he immediately uses a racial slur. This is shocking and unexpected, more so because of the delivery and the circumstances, robbing the scene of artificial theatricality. Ryan's portrayal of Earle is very interesting; on the one hand, he is a deeply bigoted man, on the other; he is in a very dysfunctional relationship. The dysfunctional relationship with his girlfriend, Lorry (Shelly Winters) balances out the occasional outbursts his character displays.

After we meet Earle and Lorry, we witness how their relationship works. She is desperate to love him, but recognizes that he is also flawed. She wants him to have the independence a job and an income of his own would grant him. But since he doesn't, she isn't above asking him to pick up her dress at the dry cleaners. She is working a job and he isn't. Why shouldn't he help out with the errands? There is also a next door neighbor (Gloria Graham), a lonely woman who flirts incessantly with Earle.

Johnny (Belafonte) is also created with a vividness we often don't see in films. A member of a jazz combo, there is almost a feeling that if he didn't have all of the extraneous influences on his life he might be a famous singer. (Gee, that's a stretch.) But Belafonte brings a quiet earnestness to the role which helps the character become three dimensional. Johnny is divorced, but still very much in love with his wife, and still very involved in her life due to their daughter. He spends as much time with his daughter as possible, taking her to parks, merry go rounds, the like. He loves his ex-wife, but is a little bothered by her attempts to become assimilated with the mostly white PTA of their daughter's school. Their relationship is difficult, but it is evident that each still holds feelings for the other.

As Johnny's life becomes influenced by elements at the nightclub, everything becomes increasingly unsettled; he is an alcoholic, using liquor to quell his problems, he is a gambler, always hoping for the next horse to win big, to settle his loses. But his bookie becomes anxious and this ends up working to Johnny's disadvantage.

After we spend a significant amount of time with each of the characters, we can see the noose tightening around each of their necks, forcing them to take part in Dave's plan.

When they eventually make the journey to Melton, the film becomes a more traditional heist film. This part also works well because Wise takes great pains to make the setting and place very realistic. We have all seen small towns like Melton and know of the large central bank, where all of the tellers know all of the customers. Dave learns of a kink in the system which they intend to take full advantage of.

Robert Wise directed some of the most popular films of our time, yet people aren't aware of him as much as they are aware of other film directors. I think the key to this is that Wise directed a wide range of films, covering many genres and other directors became famous for concentrating in a particular area. Wise has directed science fiction (""The Day The Earth Stood Still""), musicals (""West Side Story"", ""The Sound of Music""), horror (""The Haunting"", a film and book which both still give me chills), drama (""Executive Suite"") and of course, crime dramas. Did you know that he started out as a sound editor working on ""Top Hat"" and ""The Gay Divorcee"", two of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers best films? Then he moved on to film editing, working on ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" with Orson Welles. A pretty impressive pedigree. It seems a shame that a film director who worked in a variety of genres should be remembered less well because of this. More film directors would benefit from working on a series of different films. Wise is a director worth remembering, a director who made a series of very impressive, very memorable films.

785472,4,6304111282,"Not quite the last film noir--that honor would probably go to either or both of Blast of Silence (1961, Allan Baron) or Underground USA (Samuel Fuller, also 1961)--this Robert Wise-directed 1959 movie fuses racial issues into its crime story and pulls it off really well.  Robert Ryan and Harry Belafonte go head to head in a heist that's planned by old retiree Ed Begley in one of his better roles; he gives just the right juice to his portrait of a bitter cop who's out to even the score.

Ryan is, as usual, terrific in his role.  What's interesting about him is that in real life, he was the exact antithesis of the roles he often played, which were nasty brutal men full of hatred, cynicism, and the urge to kill.  Ryan was actually a leftist, one of the first organizers of the Ban the Bomb movement in the 60s out in California.  Knowing that, it's absolutely fascinating to see him portray a vicious racist in this film who, as well, gets it on with his sleazy neighbor played by none other than Gloria Grahame, sleaze queen of film noir.

Belafonte is a revelation here.  This and his role in Robert Altman's Kansas City, decades later, will probably be seen as his best.  Here, dressed in shades and turtleneck, he epitomizes cool, but is in deep s**t, owing a chunk of change in gambling debts.  He's got every reason to join up with Begley for the heist of a bank in upstate New York, a so-called easy score.

Heists in film noir never go off as planned and this is no exception.  While some of the elements here are standard noir fare (old embittered cop, heist that goes wrong), the addition of the theme of racism, as well as the brilliant acting, sets this apart from a bunch of other similar films.  Odds Against Tomorrow can be perceived as a transitional film in the film noir canon, seamlessly bridging the gap from pure noir to social drama, a staple of 50s and 60s film.  In that it does a great job.

Director Robert Wise, interestingly, started off his career working with Val Lewton in the great horror series typified by such films as I Walked with a Zombie and Cat People.  Wise directed Curse of the Cat People and Body Snatcher in this series, then graduated to Westerns (Blood on the Moon) and film noir (Born to Kill, Odds Against Tomorrow).  This last film was a transitional point; he then moved on to big budget productions like The Haunting, West Side Story, and Sound of Music.  Odds Against Tomorrow is definitely some of his best work; this is a tightly plotted, crisply executed film whose actors get the whole picture and do a great job.

Great piece of film noir and at the current price, a real steal. Excellent addition to your film noir DVD collection.",1111363200,7,2696,4.512345679012346
