8223522,3,B000WI8OMG,"If you're a big fan of Death Note & can't wait for the complete series of dvds to all be released, then this is a good option for you.  Be warned, though, that the subtitles can reach comical levels in some places (Near is referred to as ""Neo"" & Mello as ""Maylou"" through all of vol. 2, then reverts back to the correct names in vol. 3--just as an example).  If you're not already familiar with the story, I wouldn't recommend watching these--it can be super-frustrating with subtitles this bad; you probably won't understand half of what is happening in such a dialogue driven story.",1211414400,2,584,4.552380952380952
8223523,5,B000WI8OMG,"volume 2 of this excellent series.  Death Note picks up the pace in this volume as the showdown with Light and L continuing in this volume with a few interesting twists.  Not going to spoil the story or anything, but you'll be pleasantly suprised if you haven't watched the series before.  A solid purchase just be warned of the spelling errors that you will find throughout.  But it won't spoil the overall premise.",1200528000,,416,4.657534246575342
