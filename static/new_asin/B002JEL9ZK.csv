3937738,5,B002JEL9ZK,"This is ingenuous, very innocent, stuck in a time bubble and sorry to say, sort of boring.  Mollie Sugden is the only reason to buy this DVD and to watch it.  She carries the entire series by herself, all the supporting actors are just that, supporting, almost unneeded...

But despite everything I like british comedies like this and I like Mollie Sugden --- and she does not disappoint although the writing and everything else does, sort of.  This is the type of show that you can close your eyes, listening to it and take a nap --- not saying this in a bad way --- but it does have a soothing quality about it.

The first time I saw this I yawned a lot, got up and did things around the apartment --- and then told myself that I would send this in to amazon for it's trade-in program --- but, surprising myself --- I am watching it again right now --- smile...

If you like Mollie Sugden, you will like this DVD --- simple enough... and, despite everything I have written --- it is deserving of its 5 stars...",1275782400,6,1012,4.3

I am positive without a doubt that until the world is no more there will never be anyone to fill these shoes. Thank God for the invention of DVD so that I can enjoy their comedic talents over and over and over again!!! They are the only antidepressant medicine I ever need. FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY.

8371394,5,B002JEL9ZK,"I had never seen this program previously, so I was uncertain in purchasing it. Am I glad I did! I have been enjoying this during times when only reruns or reality shows were on regular programing. This is excellent if you like British comedy which is more subtle than American comedy.  I enjoy it very much. Buy it, you'll like it.",1398384000,,331,4.426229508196721
8371395,4,B002JEL9ZK,"It stars Mollie Sugden - how could you not like it?

It's not as funny as Are You Being Served? and I would have liked to have seen more difference between Mollie's roles in each, but it's very worth watching - and re-watching.

In series 4 and 5 they move to the country.  I expected to dislike this and find the episodes losing their vigour but they don't.  Robert's ""other mother"" and uncle still turn up frequently enough that they're not really missed.  A very good Brtish comedy.",1390089600,,485,4.465909090909091

Mollie Sugden, known to the many fans of Are You Being Served?, stars as a woman who gave up her son for adoption only to be hired years later by his wife to be their housekeeper.",1363824000,,216,4.166666666666667
8371400,5,B002JEL9ZK,"Molly Sugden and hilarious comedy talents go together like gin and tonic, (and you don't even have to pass the tonic bottle over the gin like Molly used to do).  That's My Boy is no exception.  Molly has done it again with a supporting cast that only adds to the laughter.  Ida's brother Wilfred is a real character, too.  Treat yourself to another good source of British comedy.  Your funny bone will thank you.",1318204800,,412,4.513513513513513
8371401,5,B002JEL9ZK,"This Yorkshire Television comedy showcased the superb comical talents of the late Mollie Sugden. Fresh from her success on BBC's Are You Being Serves, That's My Boy was a Friday night hit for the UK's ITV network running for five seasons. The first of these five seasons introduces Mollie's character Ida Willis to the son she gave away for adoption years ago. With a fantastic supporting cast including the late Christopher Blake as son Robert (or Shane as Ida prefers to call him), Jennifer Lonsdale as Robert's wife Angie, Clare Richards as Robert's ""other mother"" and the late Harold Goodwin as Ida's brother Wilfred.
From season 4 Ida and co are relocated from London to a medical practice in Yorkshire. I felt the episodes in Yorkshire were not as amusing as the London ones.
If you like classic British comedy, this is for you!
Well worth the purchase.",1314230400,3,859,4.8108108108108105
