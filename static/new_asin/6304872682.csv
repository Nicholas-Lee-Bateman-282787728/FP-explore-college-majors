8277428,5,6304872682,"I recently purchased this video because the one I once owned from these games,(taped from tv), was taken to the dump, by mistake, but not by me!!! I hasten to add. I live in the UK and it is impossible to buy these videos here, the only ones we can generally get are the Torvill & Dean tapes....I was delighted to be able to purchase this through Amazon and I bought it primarily for the Tara Lipinsky programme(unforgettable!)....A couple of previous reviewers noted their irritation at the Scott Hamilton commentary, but for me it was the opposite, I found it enhanced my viewing of the tape, I like to hear the commentators getting caught up in the moment and expressing their joy or otherwise at the programmes.  I thought this tape was excellent, very enjoyable from beginning to end, with plenty of highlights, and although we get a limited number of full programmes the main one was there for me, and the very reasonable price I paid for the tape and shipment to the UK was well worth Tara's programme alone..I love figure skating and I have many competition tapes which I have taped from tv...unfortunately, it is a minority sport here and not held in the same high regard that it is in the USA and Canada....so I say for anyone thinking of purchasing it, go ahead, I found it great value for money.",1155254400,2,1307,4.561702127659575
8277429,3,6304872682,"I taped everything during the actual Olympics, but I like to purchase videos like this because sometimes they cut the commentary out, which is what I would have enjoyed on this tape. Scott Hamilton although he may be a  great skater is so annoying in this video that everytime he screached over  a clean jump it made me angry. What I didn't like was that Scott contradicted hismelf several times in this video and it was obvious he had favorites. If you are a fan of Michelle & Tara and missed their  programs this tape provides what you are looking for.",961113600,5,554,4.465346534653466
