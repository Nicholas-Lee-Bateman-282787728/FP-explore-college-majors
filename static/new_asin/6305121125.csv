7883133,1,6305121125,"There is nothing wrong with this video, however, it is EXACTLY the same video as ""The Art of Hitting Slow Pitch Softball"", but that one has 15 extra minutes of instruction.  Don't waste your money by purchasing both like I did - just buy ""The Art of Hitting Slow Pitch Softball"" and you're getting what you need at half the cost.",1094601600,,329,4.39344262295082
7883134,5,6305121125,"This video is, undoubtedly, one of the best videos on how to connect with a slow-pitched softball with impact!  It will have instant appeal to all ages of players because its presentation is easy-to-understand, and can be immediately applied. Each phase of the softball ""swing"": the stance-the stride-the swing itself is clearly illustrated, and explained  in plain, simple language. All the  critical mechanics  of the batting technique-which enable a hitter to hit the ball with authority-are now available to every player.  It's a great video!",982540800,26,546,5.376470588235295
