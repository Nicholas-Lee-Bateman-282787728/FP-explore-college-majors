6708203,5,B00O2QWDY4,"I've watched all (or I think all) of the ANCIENT ALIENS first series, so I took the chance on this DVD set. Well, I watched it completely in two nights and then started over again. This is great fun with good production quality. Although there are some rehashes from the first series, they are snippets and/or reused bits of better graphics sewn in nicely with the new investigations. In every episode I learned something new, which pleased me because these are topics I have researched and followed for a long time. I cannot wait for more episodes.

Ancient Aliens Debunked on youtube by Mr. White is a good start but he was strangely disappointing as a guest on Coast to Coast AM.  He seems better at producing thoughtful films rather than thinking on his feet.,1454889600,3,302,4.357142857142857

6708227,5,B00O2QWDY4,"As an Ancient Alien fan myself, this is the frosting on the cake!!
I absolutely love Tsoukalous in his own series!! He gets to explain the theory behind the Ancient Alien Theory, and we follow him around the world in his hunt for answers. Even if the themes presented are not new to me, the material are presented in an explanatory way that makes you understand why Giorgio searches where he does. It's kind of a treasure hunt from the couch.
I would probably choose this over the Ancient Aliens DVDs if I had to (but I will always have space for both of them so the problem is imaginative), everyone needs to understand why something is brought into a conclusion and it is to the point what Giorgio does in his In Search of Aliens, in his own awesome, Girogio way.
Keep it coming!",1441670400,,781,4.393103448275862

6708229,5,B00O2QWDY4,"These were fascinating shows. My only complaint is that there weren't more episodes! They offer ""possible"" explanations and ask more questions. REALLY interesting! Either the ancients had ""help"" from ""someplace"" else, or they were so far more advanced in technology than we are today and that technology was lost. You just can't ""debunk"" some of this stuff.
If you like Ancient Aliens, you should REALLY like THIS show. There ARE English subtitles for the hearing impaired and they list bonus features. I certainly hope there will be a season 2.",1437264000,4,545,5.066666666666666

6708233,4,B00O2QWDY4,"Georgio T.'s unbridled enthusiasm for history makes me smile.  As for his absolute refusal to kowtow to those schools of thought that won't even consider alternate theories, I say, 'right on'!  He seems like a kid at heart which,  in my opinion, we should all get to be, regardless of our ages.  I find science fascinating but sometimes 'the experts' could benefit from being a little more like Georgio and a little less like parental figures telling the rest of us that we've had enough fun for one night. You don't have to agree with all of his conclusions in order to get something from these films; just keep an open mind and enjoy the ride!",1432857600,2,645,4.5344827586206895
6708234,5,B00O2QWDY4,"The series arrived on time and in perfect condition. If you like ""Ancient Aliens"" you'll love this series. It continues with just ""Giorgio"" doing his own exploring. He visits facinating places. He studies strange objects and does research on them. Love it!!!",1432598400,,258,5.166666666666667
6708235,5,B00O2QWDY4,"I love this. It's kitchy, although it doesn't mean to be. The opening sequence to each episode is unintentionally hilarious! (he's all tan, and reaching for stuff...)

Do I ""believe""? Yes, I whole-heartedly do. Do I buy everything Giorgio is selling? Oh, hellz naw. But I do get to see some incredible places, and yes, he gives you something to think about...sometimes.

The clarity of the items shown and people was perfectly clear on my 47"" 1080P TV. The subject matter was well presented, and included some items that had not been brought-up on the Ancient Aliens series. I SINCERELY hope it continues to put out new seasons, at least until we get the WHOLE story from the ones who actually made and/or did the things the show covers!  :)",1430524800,,479,4.382022471910112

6708246,5,B00O2QWDY4,"I enjoyed watching all of these episodes. I enjoyed them so much, I am going to watch them again! It doesn't matter how much our wild-haired host Giorgio Tsoukalos speculates about aliens coming to our planet; he actually travels to ancient and intriguing places in the world and shows real footage of these exotic places. That is educational and worth watching alone. The interviews with the ""kooks"" and locals seem credible and add to the entertainment value.
I will admit I have a sort of sentimental appreciation for Giorgio. When my father was dying in the hospital, I noticed he was watching Giorgio's ""Ancient Aliens"" show on TV. I asked him what he thought of the show, and he said he liked it because Giorgio's ""voice is soothing."" My Dad was really scared, and I will forever be grateful to Giorgio for helping to make his last days here a little more comfortable.",1425859200,,874,4.718954248366013
6708247,5,B00O2QWDY4,Awesome,1425859200,,7,7.0
6708248,5,B00O2QWDY4,"Giorgio A. Tsoukalos was so popular on Ancient Aliens that its creators decided to give Giorgio his own spin-off show. In it he takes to the road and goes In Search Of Aliens.

The show is well thought out and very entertaining. I find it interesting how Giorgio can take pretty much any subject (The Loch Ness Monster for example) and somehow tie it in to the ""Ancient Alien Theory"".

Season One's subject matter is a mix of:
1. Fresh topics (The Mystery Of Loch Ness, Searching For Bigfoot, The Mystery Of The Cyclops, and The Roswell Rock).

2. Not-so-fresh topics (Puma Punku, Atlantis, and The Nazca Lines have already been covered a lot on Ancient Aliens).

3. Episodes that lift old footage from Ancient Aliens and add a little new information. (Nazi Time Travelers uses footage from the AA Season 2 episode Aliens And The Third Reich and The Founding Of America uses footage from the AA Season 3 episode 'Aliens And The Founding Fathers'. Watch both and compare.)

I would have preferred all new topics but I still find these entertaining even with the rehash and I highly recommend the show to fans of Ancient Aliens. The ten episodes are spread over three dvds as follows:

Disc One:
01 The Hunt For Atlantis
02 Nazi Time Travelers
03 The Mystery Of Loch Ness
04 The Roswell Rock

Disc Two:
05 Searching For Bigfoot
06 The Mystery Of The Cyclops
07 The Mystery Of Puma Punku

Disc Three:
08 The Founding Of America
09 The Mystery Of Nazca
10 The Alien Code

Video: The episodes are presented in a more or less solid 1:78 anamorphic widescreen transfer. The bright sunlight in some of the outdoor scenes cause faces to look a little washed out. Turning the contrast on my TV a little lower than usual pretty much solved the issue for me. The fine lines in Giorgio's forehead are still washed out but I not that bothered.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 2.0 Dolby Digital. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are English SDH subtitles.

Extras: There are ten ""bonus pieces"" on disc three. These are outtakes/deleted scenes from the episodes that were not shown on TV.",1424995200,19,2123,4.587301587301587
6708249,5,B00O2QWDY4,"Since Georgio is part of the Ancient Alien team, this DVD is supurb.
If your interested in finding out your true origins and have an open mind,
and can get past the brain washing of organized religion, then you've got
a good chance of waking up.",1424995200,2,245,4.3478260869565215
6708250,3,B00O2QWDY4,"This DVD would be of a higher rating if it was not for the poor video quality !  In general the picture quality looks somewhat washed out and a person should not have to make adjustments to the TV settings in order to get a reasonably good picture when other DVD's of all kinds play perfectly well when watched with the settings that were made initially for this TV in order to receive the best quality picture performance for this particular unit..

It was to be expected that because of the fact that the presenter, Giorgio Tsoukalos, has participated in numerous episodes of the History Channel's programs of the same kind, that there would be some sort of duplication in certain  episodes. He brings however a new approach to them and presents some new views and perspectives to certain subjects that it makes the series still interesting to watch and might promise some hope for future episodes. We'll wait and see.",1424649600,8,920,4.701863354037267

8681752,5,B00O2QWDY4,"This was excellent!  We think that everything has been discovered and then wow - they come up with something more.  Atlantis is out there somewhere and we will find it.  I suppose that some government may have it hidden somewhere like what Roswell got caught up in, but that is the beauty of it all, we just don't know.  I thought this may just be more of the same but not so - new stuff - great.

  I was interested in the actual composition of the Roswell Rock.  Was it made out of indigenous Rock by a visitor from afar?  Or is the actual Rock made of something ""Not of this Earth""?  I cant imagine  leaving that out by mistake.  But suppose they had said it was made of something ""Not of this Earth"".  It would likely wind up in some Area 51 warehouse or Wright Patterson AFB Hangar.  Again the beauty of it all, NO ONE KNOWS.

  Some day we will truly understand the true meaning of ""take me to your leader"".  Maybe they will land in the middle of an ISIS battlefield.  That would truly be a interesting day.",1528329600,,1013,4.209424083769633
