3002153,5,B000XECFXS,"It took a lot of guts on the part of the Coppola family to release this documentary in the first place. Not many people would make public filmed footage of a family's patriarch losing his mind and coming dangerously close to total mental meltdown while making a movie. And in this case we are talking about a highly respected and honored director.

Francis Ford Coppola's descent into madness during the plagued filming of ""Apocalypse Now"" wasn't entirely the fault of the Philippines Army, horrific weather, Martin Sheen's heart attack during filming, or Marlon Brando's prima donna attitude. It wasn't just the rampant use of pop drugs on the set. Much of the trouble, including the lack of a cohesive script, falls directly on the shoulders of the director. And ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse,"" shot by the director's wife, Eleanor Coppola, and released 12 years after the original movie, never turns away from the truth. It is a fascinating account of how everything went wrong and still a remarkable film ascended from the madness.

Anyone who believes FF Coppola either botched or somehow missed great opportunity with the compound segment of the film can upon viewing this begin to understand how chaos during those dark days on the set in the late 1970s led to the final outcome. The director said, his film isn't about Vietnam; it is Vietnam. That statement is somewhat validated with this documentary.

It is amazing that such a powerful piece of filmmaking could come out of such a calamity. But, flaws and all, it is among the best films produced out of Hollywood. And this companion piece is a vital part of the story. It is a MUST SEE for fans of ""Apocalypse Now."" It is engrossing for all.

The late coming DVD release (November 2007) reportedly includes an update piece (""CODA: Thirty Years Later"") that is most welcome. It's icing. Buy this one.",1193184000,17,1877,4.85625
3002154,5,B000XECFXS,"Why it took so long for this fascinating documentary to be released on DVD I don't know, but at least it finally has been. Taking us inside the making of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now,"" it mixes interviews with the principals (including Coppola, his star Martin Sheen, and others) with footage shot by Coppola's wife during the actual production. As the shooting dragged on and the budget skyrocketed and Coppola dealt with everything from Third World leaders to heart attacks to nervous studio heads, a drama unfolded that was every bit as captivating as the one he was trying to capture on film. An indispensable look at movie-making in the Decade of the Director, and worth half a dozen Masters courses in film. Plus, just plain fun to watch.",1155859200,2,766,4.9

3002156,4,B000XECFXS,"As a fan of storytelling, I have to admit that Ive been overly eager to watch the documentary on the making of Apocalypse Now for quite some time.  Apocalypse Now is almost the epitome of storytelling, at least in its creation, as Coppola and Co. faced every single possible challenge in making this film, and came out of it with something that still stands the test of time.

But Hearts of DarknessHearts of Darkness is the real story, the story that seems to get all too close to the novel Apocalypse Now attempted to emulate, as we watch Coppola slowly drift into madness whilst attempting to figure out how to tell the story he wanted to tell.

On the surface, Hearts of Darkness really is a fairly straightforward making of movie.  From the start, we are told to expect Coppola to go insane.  In fact, the movie opens with Coppolas own words, We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.  Honestly, all of the build up was probably a bit too much, considering all he really did was have a fairly substantial mental breakdown as  the shoot stretched onbut who wouldnt after being stuck in the jungle for 238 days battling actor egos, government militia, and incredibly inclement weather?

What I found most interesting about this film, however, is the concept of trying to tell the story.  Coppola went into the jungle not knowing how he was going to end the movie.  He had a grandiose ideal, but no idea on how to wrap it all up.  He spent the better part of a year living this movie in the jungle, and still had absolutely no clue how to finish it, resorting to shooting three weeks of actors just winging it during the short time he had Brando on set.

And this is where I found this movie itself lacking.  They were trying to tell the story of how Coppola went insane (a story that doesnt really have an ending itself anyways), but we really telling the story of a man trying to tell a story that doesnt have an endingwhich didn't get an ending.  I mean, there wasn't even a nod to the editing room where someone (according to Wikipedia, not Coppola) was left with miles and miles of film with the need to somehow put it all together into a cohesive narrative.  I suppose the end of the story is the movie Apocalypse Now itself, in which we find that the ending isn't really complete (in fact: side note: the ending was so incomplete in the original version that Coppola had included shots of random explosions for the credits just as a bit of visual pizzazz, which people believed told of an ordered air strike which would change the tone of the end completelywhich Coppola then pulled the film to change the ending to basic white text on black background normalcy).

In the end, this documentary is a fun view into what all can go into the making of a film, especially if the film is intended to be done in a manner well outside of the standard studio method, by a filmmaker who is consumed by his vision.  Its very similar, in some ways, to what happens inside my head when writing a novel.  You know, without the malaria shots.

Have fun out there!",1426550400,,3155,4.436741767764298

3002163,5,B000XECFXS,"Can't say much more than what's already been said. But I can relate to Francis' unrelenting obsession. And how it was almost by divine providence that the movie is as good and simplistically pure as it is. So many other Viet Nam movies - though very good, seem somewhat dated now. But Apocalypse Now I think will forever be timeless in itself. Coppola's 'Viet Nam', for all it's detail and conflict, is almost like a Disney animated backdrop. As if the soldiers are in a burning movie theater while Bambi plays on the screen. And I think it's safe to say that's how Francis wanted it to be as well, without being so obvious.  As much as Kubrick successfully changed 'the form of sci-fi' with 2001. Francis was as 'maniacal' if not more so to change how we perceive 'war movies'. And though still under contention if Apocalypse Now is an overt war movie, or a suspense film on a epic scale? Just a great, powerful, and timeless movie that will be enjoyed by generations to come.

The film is a collection of behind-the-scenes footage, audio recordings, and recollections from Francis Ford Coppola's wife Eleanor during and after the making of Apocalypse Now.  The result is an extremely intimate insiders look at moviemaking.  It is eyeopening to hear one of our greatest filmmakers - in the middle of making arguably one of the greatest films of the past 50 years - seemingly on the verge of a nervous breakdown and suicidal as the production crumbles around him.  This is a story of persistence, of risking everything, of facing insermountable obstacles... and, ultimately, of not just surviving but triumphing.  By the way, it is interesting to note that the Coppola's recorded a current commentary track for the movie that seems to be an attempt to rewrite history; contradicting some of the spontaneous and unguarded statements Francis Ford Coppola made within the documentary.

Nor does it chronicle very effectively her husband's legendary 'descent into madness' that those of us of a certain age read so much about in the press at the time as one comes away with the impression that Francis wasn't anything more than vexed at any given point during the movie's tortuous production.

3002180,5,B000XECFXS,"This is a fascinating documentary and a fitting footnote to Coppola's mesmerising Apocalypse Now - still the most ambitious (and possibly the greatest) war movie ever made, flawed though it may be in parts.

Hearts Of Darkness - which takes its name from the Joseph Conrad novella on which AN is loosely based - is the story of the making of the film, shot on a handheld VCR by the director's wife Eleanor. It's an honest and uncompromising visual diary, showing her husband's many frustrations and crises on location in the Philippines - think devastating hurricanes, leading actor having a heart attack, helicopters requisitioned to fight a civil war, etc etc. And as if all those problems weren't enough Coppola then had to deal with a massively overweight Marlon Brando turning up for his $1m cameo appearance, towards the end of shooting, not knowing his lines and threatening to quit on the spot if the camera showed his enormous girth!

All the interviews and anecdotes are highly absorbing especially those with scriptwriter John Milius, Martin Sheen and Coppola himself, whose closing monologue, recorded over 30 years ago, is still just as profound and relevant today. Also of interest is the famous 'plantation scene', edited out of the final cut of AN at the last minute although included in the later (inferior) 'Redux' edition. But perhaps the most dramatic moments are of Coppola on the phone to Hollywood, desperately trying to keep the lid on Sheen's heart attack so that his studio doesn't pull the plug on the whole shebang.

Spellbinding stuff - very possibly the best documentary ever made about the process of film-making and a pure inspiration to anybody who has a goal and wants to find the drive/determination to make it come to fruition, no matter what the obstacles.",1359590400,,1793,4.95016611295681

3002183,5,B000XECFXS,"I saw ""Apocalypse Now"" when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in the Fall of 1979, when I was 19. To say the movie made a big impression on me would be the understatement of the century. I've seen the movie multiple times since (inclduing in the ""Redux"" version). But incredibly, I had never seen this documentary (which I knew was out there) until recently, when I saw it at my local library's DVD documentary section. Don't ask me why, I don't know (even though I am a huge movie buff).

""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" (original release from 1991; 96 min.) brings the story behind the making of ""Apocalypse Now"". Even though I was generally familiar with all of the problems encountered during the movie's production (troubled script; changing lead actors weeks into the shoot; typhoon destroying the sets; Martin Sheen's heart attack, just to name those among others), it never resonnated completely with me until now how deep those problems were. Eleanor Coppola filmed much of the on-set documentary footage, and what we see here is just beyond belief, and fingerlicking good, pure paradise really, for any buff of movie history. The things that resonate the most for me: how the opening scene of the movie (Martin Sheen in his Hanoi hotel room) really came about, with Sheen so drunk for real he couldn't stand up properly and then cutting his hand when he smashes the mirror but refusing to stop shooting, just wow. Then there are the scenes with Dennis Hopper, brought in at the last minute and unable to remember his lines. But the cherry of the cake is to see how utterly clueless and desparate Francis Coppola is when shooting scenes with Marlon Brando, as Coppola is trying to figure out a way to make sense and find an ending to the movie, improvising all along the way.

I am just floored by this documentary. It should be required viewing for anyone going to film school (maybe it is, I don't know). But for anyone who is a serious lover of movie history, this is required viewing, and you'll enjoy it immensely from start to finish. ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalyse"" is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1340582400,2,2147,4.722666666666667
3002184,5,B000XECFXS,"During the mid to late 1970's, Frances Ford Coppola asked his wife Eleanor to document the filming of ""Apocalypse Now"" primarily for purposes of promoting the film.  She did and in 1990, additional interviews were conducted with various cast and crew members who worked on the film.  The documentary details with great depth the difficulty of the shoot and the near despair and collapse of Coppola.  It is if hurdles were thrown at him from God.  Everything from the weather to the Philippine government to the lead actor's (Martin Sheen) heart attack to the miserable and cantankerous Marlon Brando.  It does what great documentaries do.

3002186,5,B000XECFXS,"In his treatise on strategy and warfare, On War, Carl von Clausewitz explains that ""Everything in war is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult.""  He goes on to explain that ""the difficulties [in war] accumulate and end by producing a kind of friction that is inconceivable unless one has experienced war... Countless minor incidents - the kind you can never really forsee - combine to lower the general level of performance, so that one always fall far short of the intended goal. Iron will-power can overcome this friction; it pulverizes every obstacle, but of course it wears down the machine as well.""

Friction is the difference between real war and war on paper, he says.  It is the difference between the plans drawn up by political and military leadership and what actually happens on the battlefield.

The concept of friction, however, is applicable to any sort of planning exercise.  We've all planned events or projects that sounded great on paper, but once we began carrying them out, we realized it wasn't at all as we had initially hoped.  Remodeling a kitchen that went from being a summer project has now crept into Christmas time.  Or perhaps a project at work that ended up costing much more than originally anticipated.  Friction is all those little unforeseen delays, costs, and obstacles that impact the timeliness, price tag, and overall quality of a project or an event.

The practical implication of friction was beautifully illustrated in the film, Hearts of Darkness: a Filmmaker's Apocalypse, which documents the filming and production of Director Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now.  It shows how Coppola went into the filming of the project with such high hopes, but so many unforeseen variables, many of which were out of his control, ended up almost wrecking the project and ruining Coppola.

The filming of Apocalypse Now took place in the Philippines, which at the time was engaged in a civil war.  Coppola was renting helicopters from the Philippine government for one of the most famous scenes in the film.  However, filming was often interrupted because the government would take a few of the helicopters back to fight the rebels.  Martin Sheen, who played Captain Willard, the film's main protagonist, had a heart attack midway through the filming and needed several weeks to recover.  Typhoon Olga came through and destroyed much of the set and forced the closing of production.  And finally, Marlon Brando, earning a then-unprecedented $1M a week, arrived on set much overweight, not prepared, and unhappy about the ending.  The film ended up being $30M over budget and four times over schedule.  In a recorded phone conversation with his wife, Coppola confessed that he no idea what he was doing and even contemplated suicide.

In the end, Coppola successfully managed the immense friction of the production.  Apocalypse Now is arguably the best Vietnam War movie ever made and the film is one of the best in history.

But how did Coppola pull this off?  How did he overcome the insurmountable obstacles that were thrown at him and create a masterpiece?  In other words, as Clausewitz asks, ""Is there any lubricant that will reduce this abrasion?""  He immediately answers: ""Only one, and a commander and his army will not always have it readily available: combat experience... Habit hardens the body for great exertions, strengthens the heart in great peril, and fortifies judgment against first impressions. Habit breeds that priceless quality, calm, which... will lighten the commander's task.""

Clausewitz believes, thus, that experience is what reduces friction.  Experience is what instills a sense of realism into the outlook of an initiative.  An experienced leader understands that there will be problems that crop up and add delays and increase costs of the project.  Experience teaches him to not get ruffled by these problems and to take the unexpected in stride.  Experienced leaders not only maintain an even keel when the unforeseen hits, but also use it to their advantage through natural gestures and improvised courses of action.  The friction forces them to be innovation and creative.

By the time of the filming of Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola already had several Academy Awards under his belt.  He won Best Picture and Best Director Awards for The Godfather and The Godfather Part II; two other films he directed and produced, The Conversation and American Graffiti, respectively, were nominated for Best Picture; and he had won three Best Screenplay Awards.  Coppola had begun his film career 17 years earlier and was, at the time, at the peak of his career.  Needless to say he was an experienced film director.

In The Hearts of Darkness, you get to see how such an experienced professional and leader handles the immense friction that happened in the production of Apocalypse Now.  He improvised the entire beginning scene when Martin Sheen, who at the time was very drunk from a birthday celebration, punches the mirror in his hotel room in Saigon.  He worked around Marlon Brando's weight by dressing him in all black and only shooting him in the dark.  And lastly, he worked the torrential downpour from the tropical storm - it rained for many days straight - into the shooting.  I couldn't imagine the film without these improvisations!

Only a director of Coppola's experience and will power could have managed the magnitude of friction that was inherent in the production of Apocalypse Now and successfully turn it into one of the best films of all-time (and even he almost failed).",1312243200,5,5574,5.042576419213974
3002187,4,B000XECFXS,"Francis Ford Coppola's film APOCALYPSE NOW was one of the most infamously troubled productions in the history of Hollywood, so resonating in collective memory that it can still be parodied in recent films like TROPIC THUNDER. A typhoon struck the set in the Philippines, local officials were difficult to work with, Martin Sheen had a heart attack during filming, and Coppola was constantly troubled how to bring his script to a powerful ending. The 1991 documentary HEARTS OF DARKNESS: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse chronicles these trials and tribulations through audio recordings that Coppola's wife Eleanor made for her filming diary, informal footage of life on the set and interviews with cast and crew.

If all HEARTS OF DARKNESS did was rehash the same general trivia one can get from Wikipedia, like so many documentaries, it wouldn't be very good. I was pleased to find that it reveals a lot about the story that I never knew before. The genesis of the screen adaption of Joseph Conrad's novel in earlier attempts by Orson Welles and George Lucas is charted. Dennis Hopper's maniacal performance is placed in the context of his own nervousness at a career slump and his thankfulness that Coppola was giving him a second chance.

Perhaps the strongest point of the film is how it reveals the mind of someone tormented by his drive to create, and how a film can result from spontaneous choices on set that go far beyond any script. When the film was first shown at Cannes, Coppola said of the production ""little by little we went insane"", and indeed his highs of inspiration and lows of self-doubt are captured here. The opening of the film where Sheen's character drunkenly breaks a mirror and slumps, bleeding and crying next to his hotel room bed, is shown to have resulted from the cameras rolling when Sheen did drunkenly stumble on set.

Upon its 1991 release this documentary must have been even more interesting as it contains much footage that appeared only in the APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX director's cut in 2001: the French Plantation scene, the interlude in the abandoned, muddy camp, etc. I was surprised to hear Coppola insist on cutting the French Plantation scene because he was unsatisfied with the quality of the French actors and the lighting, not because of its place in the story. But what remains remarkable about HEARTS OF DARKNESS is that it betrays nothing of the scenes out of the 5-hour workprint that remain cut from commercial release, such as the prominent role given to Lt. Colby and his murder of the American photographer. There's also absolutely no shots of Harvey Keitel as Captain Williard before he was replaced.

This particular DVD release contains a second feature, ""Coda: 30 Years Later"", which documents Coppola's shooting of YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH in Romania in 2006.",1293667200,,2805,4.936440677966102
3002188,3,B000XECFXS,"Ha haha...sorry about the title of my review...I guess I need to get out more.

Anyway, I don't see how this is a 5 Star movie.  I was eager to see this behind-the-scenes look at the wild overruns in the making of ""Apocolypse Now"", but was I disappointed.  The documentary is a high level overview, glossing over key incidents  with little introspection.

So..ok...there was a hurricane, the Phillipine govt. borrowed back its helicopters for a day and Martin Sheen had a heart attack.  Clearly setbacks, but they don't add up to the debacle reportedly surrounding the making of ""Apocolypse Now"". As the footage is average, even these events do not raise this documentary above a typical ""making of"" film.

Narrative is added after the filming, so the it loses any ""you are there"" feeling.  The narrative has the typical pompous, self-important ring of people involved in the film and tends to break any tension that may be there. Francis Ford Coppola never admits to doing anything wrong or lessons learned from the experience, adding to the pomposity.

There is much that could have added needed drama ....Why was Harvey Keitel fired in the first two weeks? Also, we are told this, but not shown...imagine a documentary that showed the firing of a major star...now THAT would be five stars!  Or even the meeting where this decision was made.  However, there is only commentary on this and even that is missing key information.

Similarly, we are only told Francis Ford Coppola was surprised that Marlon Brando did not read the book, ""Heart of Darkness"", on which the movie is based and of Mr. Coppola's surprise at Mr. Brando's weight gain.  Watching these and other conversations between the high profile director and major star would have been great, but there is no filming of any exchange of dialogue between the two of them.  It's likely that one of them (take a guess) didn't allow these events to be filmed.  So, the Marlon Brando footage is mostly filmed from approximately 25 feet back and there are a few outtakes.

I imagine there was tremendous tension on the set, short tempers, illness, backstabbing...perhaps even marital strife between Francis Ford Coppola and his wife, who made the documentary.  I mean, is it actually possible that there was less tension in  making ""Apocolypse Now"" than in the reality program ""The Survivor""?

Ultimately, it's an adequate ""making of"" documentary on the caliber of the extra disk on a two-disc ""special"" release of a movie, hardly a landmark documentary on a landmark film.",1277683200,4,2528,4.905882352941177

The songs ""Suzie Q"" and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" have been replaced with some corny, cheap imitations--to save money, I suppose. Likewise, in one scene in the original version of the film, Francis Ford Coppola serenades a little girl sitting on his lap--the song? ""Anything Goes."" In the DVD version of the film, Coppola's singing has been removed, which makes the footage pointless. I don't know if the song was removed because of the potentially immoral implications, or due to more fees for the rights to the song ""Anything Goes."" Either way, I feel that someone has messed with a masterpiece. Of course the film is still great and should not be missed. Perhaps you have to have seen the original as many times as I have to notice these changes. I only hope I encounter no more changes as I resume watching the film.

Francis Ford Coppola's wife Eleanor is responsible for much of the footage and it's a combination of interviews from 1975-76 and those from 1990. It fills in many blanks that will fascinate fans of Apocalypse Now. The interviews with Martin Sheen were superb as was the discussion of the peculiarities (and blatant irresponsibility) of Marlon Brando. The unkempt and passionate Coppola was something to see on the original set, and I had no idea the types of chances he took in the hopes of getting his film made. Also of interest, was the method by which the John Milius's original script was synced with the vision of Coppola. This documentary provides viewers with great inside baseball and may even appeal to those who haven't seen Apocalypse Now.",1248825600,,838,4.826388888888889
3002192,3,B000XECFXS,"Hearts Of Darkness glosses over one of the more important aspects of the film's creation, the hiring and firing of the first actor, Harvey Keitel, to portray Lt. Willard. We are simply told it was not working, and cut to Francis's hiring of Martin Sheen. But, we never see any of the footage shot with Keitel, we never learn if he was simply too different from Francis's vision of Willard to work, or was he simply doing a poor job, a malcontent, or clashing too frequently with Francis. For a so-called documentary to leave such wide open says much of the aims of the documentarian, in this case Eleanor. Also left open-ended is a much talked about aspect of the filming that the documentary does not cover, and that is Francis's infidelity on the set, and how that contributed to the distance between the couple. How this affected Eleanor's documentary, much less Apocalypse Now, is certainly ripe for discussion. This is the rare instance where such is not mere gossip for gossip's sake, but pertinent information about the director's state of mind in the improvisatory aspects of the film. Was his film more gloomy because of the infidelity's consequences? Hearts Of Darkness does a great disservice to its viewers by totally avoiding such questions, even as it claims a rare intimacy, due to Eleanor's claim to have surreptitiously recorded conversations without Francis's knowledge.

Overall, the DVD package is barely worth an investment, especially if a Coppola fan, but once again the studio that put out the DVD could have offered so much more for so little an investment. Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse is a good and worthwhile 'Making Of' feature for a DVD release, but, as a stand alone documentary, it is rather lacking. Thus, with two making of documentaries, and no real feature, the package is saved by the aforementioned pluses alone. Better than nothing, but most viewers will wind up asking, 'Well, that's it?'

It gives essential insight into the creative process and bedraggled production of one of the greatest films of the 20th Century.  The interviews are sometimes intense, some of them with cast members describing their surrealistic experience on the movie, many with a frantic, enraged Coppola (not aware of himself being taped), grabbing for a branch on the shore as the river hurtles him downstream towards an ending he hasn't even written yet.

This film documents a man with a wish to bring Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" to the screen while bringing it up to date and satisfying a generation by making the War in Viet Nam his allegory.  The only real problem with the production of ""Apocalypse Now"" seems to be the man behind the project.  Francis Ford Coppola, coming off his well-deserved reputation from directing ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather II"" set out to make ""Apocalypse Now"" well before he was prepared to.  His artistic concepts seemed well-thought out but his inability to convey them to his chosen cast left him throwing out scenes because the actors just didn't get the idea.  Well, whose fault is that?  We get ""tragic"" stories about monsoons (What! In the Phillipines?!!!?), temporary losses of essential equiptment, unexplained cast changes, and many other causes of unfortold delays and cost over-runs.  This is the stuff of which comedies are made.  ""Day for Night"" is a great example of a movie made about making a movie.  It suceeds because the director is able to touch the audience with joy and sorrow while involving us with the characters.  ""The Heart of Darkness"" could be subtitled ""My Husband is a Genius and I Want to Show You Why All That @#%&## You Read about the Making of 'Apocalypse Now' is not His Fault"".

I rented this movie solely because I saw it listed on the ""NY Times 1000 Best Movies"" (or something like that).  This movie should not even make the top 10,000.  I see, from the overwhelmingly favorable reviews, that many others would agree that ""The Heart of Darkness"" is a great film.  My guess is that they were of the opinion that ""Apocalypse Now"" was one of the great movies of all time and they just can't get enough of it or anything about it.  To me, nothing else makes sense.  Hopefully it is not too late for Mrs. Michael Cimino to produce a movie on her husband's creation of ""Heaven's Gate"".",1230336000,8,2151,4.62532981530343
3002195,4,B000XECFXS,"Like the other reviewers, I found this documentary to be fascinating.  If you are a Coppola fan, it's a can't miss.  That said, I have a couple of caveats to the unconditional raves given by other reviewers:  First, if you already have the VHS version, the DVD ""extras"" are pretty weak (of course, if you no longer have a VHS player, you may want to pick up a copy of the DVD anyway).  The ""Coda"" is actually about Francis's recent film ""Youth without Youth,"" not about looking back on the making of ""Apocalypse, Now"" from the present.  A good chunk of this short documentary consists of Francis reclining in bed pontificating about what turned out to be a pretty weak film.  Both Francis and Eleanor Coppola (Francis's wife) provide commentaries on ""Hearts of Darkness"" - the commentaries are mixed together, although recorded separately.  Unfortunately, neither commentary is very interesting.  Francis apparently contributed his mainly so he could assert multiple times that the unfavorable press he received while filming ""Apocalypse, Now"" was unfair.  He argues that he should have been seen as an artist risking his own money following a dream, rather than a filmmaker descending into psychosis.  Fair enough, but he didn't need to keep repeating the point, and after all these years with the film having turned out to be a huge critical and commercial success, why does he still care what the trade papers were writing about him 30 years ago?  In addition, the commentaries are pretty skimpy; there are long sections where the film plays with no commentary.  Francis passes on the opportunity to provide additional insight into such things as the replacement of Harvey Keitel with Martin Sheen during the early days of filming.  Second, although this documentary relied heavily on film shot by Eleanor during the making of ""Apocalypse, Now,"" she wasn't actually the director - Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper were.  Apparently, they were responsible for the interviews with all of the film's stars - except Brando, who refused to participate.  As far as I could tell, the two directors don't seem to receive credit on the commentary track.

So, certainly worth picking up if you haven't seen it before.  But not a DVD to buy for the extras.",1224374400,3,2248,4.952

-  Harvey Keitel was originally cast to play Capt. Willard and was fired and replaced for Martin Sheen.

-  The part in the hotel room where Capt. Willard is spiraling out of control was just as much Sheen.  It was his 36th birthday he was drunk and actually punched and broke the glass mirror and broke down.

-  Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack while filming and was actually given his last rights, halting filming for a couple of months.

- Coppola mortgaged his own house and used his own money to make the film.

-  The boat going down river and the crew specifically Sam Bottoms character was actually under the influence of drugs while filming most of the time.

-  Some filming was shot during a typhoon that killed nearly 200 local people.

-  Hearts of Darkness was supposed to be Orson Welles first movie instead he did Citizen Kane when it fell through.

-  Some of the script was written and altered by Coppola while filming influenced by his dreams and most of the movie he did not have an ending for.

-  A civil war was taking place in parts of the Philippines while shooting and helicopters used for the film from the Philippine govt had to be taken straight out of filming and into battle.

Writer-directors Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper took this raw material and assembled an amazing, intense documentary that takes the viewer about as uncomfortably close to the utter madness of filmmaking as most of us would care to get.

It's a miracle a movie that good came out of this whole situation but for me, the film's weak link is the Brando part and after seeing the level of irresponsibility he showed during filming, it's far from surprising.

As a result, I eagerly watched HEARTS OF DARKNESS on DVD after last seeing it more than 10 years ago.  I was very nervous that Coppola would be releasing a butchered form of the documentary.  After all, he bares his soul in a way that few real artists do in public -- the picture of him holding a gun to his head (and not all in fun) is pretty intense stuff.

I am happy to report that the whole film is here, there doesn't appear to any cuts and the run time (96 minutes) matches that of the official times listed on the Internet. Thank you, Francis!

Now to the DVD extra, an hour-long documentary called CODA: THIRTY YEARS LATER.  It's this new documentary (40% of the total DVD content!) which explains why Coppola is finally re-releasing HOD.

Rather it is a documentary on Coppola's newest film YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH.  Perhaps because YWY looks to be an essential parlor piece with lots of dialog, CODA is, unfortunately, tedious.  In fact, YWY has not yet been given a wide release in the US, so what we really have here is a (you guessed it) ""Making of..."" film for marketing purposes.  Sure, it would have made a great extra on the YWY DVD, but it is a huge letdown after HEARTS OF DARKNESS.  In fact, CODA didn't leave me wanting to see YWY and initial professional reviews reveal that the film itself is a letdown.

Instead, rejoice that Coppola decided to re-release HEARTS OF DARKNESS to home video to market his new film.

Not many people would make public filmed footage of a family's patriarch losing his mind and coming dangerously close to total mental meltdown while making a movie. And in this case we are talking about a highly respected and honored director.

Francis Ford Coppola's descent into madness during the plagued filming of ""Apocalypse Now"" wasn't entirely the fault of the Philippines Army, horrific weather, Martin Sheen's heart attack during filming, or Marlon Brando's prima donna attitude. It wasn't just the rampant use of pop drugs on the set. Much of the trouble, including the lack of a cohesive script, falls directly on the shoulders of the director. And ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse,"" shot by the director's wife, Eleanor Coppola, and released 12 years after the original movie, never turns away from the truth. It is a fascinating account of how everything went wrong and still a remarkable film ascended from the madness.

Anyone who believes FF Coppola either botched or somehow missed great opportunity with the compound segment of the film can upon viewing this begin to understand how chaos during those dark days on the set in the late 1970s led to the final outcome. The director said, his film isn't about Vietnam; it is Vietnam. That statement is somewhat validated with this documentary.

It is amazing that such a powerful piece of filmmaking could come out of such a calamity. But, flaws and all, it is among the best films produced out of Hollywood. And this companion piece is a vital part of the story. It is a MUST SEE for fans of ""Apocalypse Now."" It is engrossing for all.

3236653,4,B000XECFXS,"As a fan of storytelling, I have to admit that Ive been overly eager to watch the documentary on the making of Apocalypse Now for quite some time.  Apocalypse Now is almost the epitome of storytelling, at least in its creation, as Coppola and Co. faced every single possible challenge in making this film, and came out of it with something that still stands the test of time.

But Hearts of DarknessHearts of Darkness is the real story, the story that seems to get all too close to the novel Apocalypse Now attempted to emulate, as we watch Coppola slowly drift into madness whilst attempting to figure out how to tell the story he wanted to tell.

On the surface, Hearts of Darkness really is a fairly straightforward making of movie.  From the start, we are told to expect Coppola to go insane.  In fact, the movie opens with Coppolas own words, We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.  Honestly, all of the build up was probably a bit too much, considering all he really did was have a fairly substantial mental breakdown as  the shoot stretched onbut who wouldnt after being stuck in the jungle for 238 days battling actor egos, government militia, and incredibly inclement weather?

What I found most interesting about this film, however, is the concept of trying to tell the story.  Coppola went into the jungle not knowing how he was going to end the movie.  He had a grandiose ideal, but no idea on how to wrap it all up.  He spent the better part of a year living this movie in the jungle, and still had absolutely no clue how to finish it, resorting to shooting three weeks of actors just winging it during the short time he had Brando on set.

And this is where I found this movie itself lacking.  They were trying to tell the story of how Coppola went insane (a story that doesnt really have an ending itself anyways), but we really telling the story of a man trying to tell a story that doesnt have an endingwhich didn't get an ending.  I mean, there wasn't even a nod to the editing room where someone (according to Wikipedia, not Coppola) was left with miles and miles of film with the need to somehow put it all together into a cohesive narrative.  I suppose the end of the story is the movie Apocalypse Now itself, in which we find that the ending isn't really complete (in fact: side note: the ending was so incomplete in the original version that Coppola had included shots of random explosions for the credits just as a bit of visual pizzazz, which people believed told of an ordered air strike which would change the tone of the end completelywhich Coppola then pulled the film to change the ending to basic white text on black background normalcy).

In the end, this documentary is a fun view into what all can go into the making of a film, especially if the film is intended to be done in a manner well outside of the standard studio method, by a filmmaker who is consumed by his vision.  Its very similar, in some ways, to what happens inside my head when writing a novel.  You know, without the malaria shots.

But Apocalypse Now I think will forever be timeless in itself. Coppola's 'Viet Nam', for all it's detail and conflict, is almost like a Disney animated backdrop. As if the soldiers are in a burning movie theater while Bambi plays on the screen. And I think it's safe to say that's how Francis wanted it to be as well, without being so obvious.  As much as Kubrick successfully changed 'the form of sci-fi' with 2001. Francis was as 'maniacal' if not more so to change how we perceive 'war movies'.

3236677,5,B000XECFXS,"This is a fascinating documentary and a fitting footnote to Coppola's mesmerising Apocalypse Now - still the most ambitious (and possibly the greatest) war movie ever made, flawed though it may be in parts.

Hearts Of Darkness - which takes its name from the Joseph Conrad novella on which AN is loosely based - is the story of the making of the film, shot on a handheld VCR by the director's wife Eleanor. It's an honest and uncompromising visual diary, showing her husband's many frustrations and crises on location in the Philippines - think devastating hurricanes, leading actor having a heart attack, helicopters requisitioned to fight a civil war, etc etc. And as if all those problems weren't enough Coppola then had to deal with a massively overweight Marlon Brando turning up for his $1m cameo appearance, towards the end of shooting, not knowing his lines and threatening to quit on the spot if the camera showed his enormous girth!

All the interviews and anecdotes are highly absorbing especially those with scriptwriter John Milius, Martin Sheen and Coppola himself, whose closing monologue, recorded over 30 years ago, is still just as profound and relevant today. Also of interest is the famous 'plantation scene', edited out of the final cut of AN at the last minute although included in the later (inferior) 'Redux' edition. But perhaps the most dramatic moments are of Coppola on the phone to Hollywood, desperately trying to keep the lid on Sheen's heart attack so that his studio doesn't pull the plug on the whole shebang.

Spellbinding stuff - very possibly the best documentary ever made about the process of film-making and a pure inspiration to anybody who has a goal and wants to find the drive/determination to make it come to fruition, no matter what the obstacles.",1359590400,,1793,4.95016611295681

3236680,5,B000XECFXS,"I saw ""Apocalypse Now"" when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in the Fall of 1979, when I was 19. To say the movie made a big impression on me would be the understatement of the century. I've seen the movie multiple times since (inclduing in the ""Redux"" version). But incredibly, I had never seen this documentary (which I knew was out there) until recently, when I saw it at my local library's DVD documentary section. Don't ask me why, I don't know (even though I am a huge movie buff).

""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" (original release from 1991; 96 min.) brings the story behind the making of ""Apocalypse Now"". Even though I was generally familiar with all of the problems encountered during the movie's production (troubled script; changing lead actors weeks into the shoot; typhoon destroying the sets; Martin Sheen's heart attack, just to name those among others), it never resonnated completely with me until now how deep those problems were. Eleanor Coppola filmed much of the on-set documentary footage, and what we see here is just beyond belief, and fingerlicking good, pure paradise really, for any buff of movie history. The things that resonate the most for me: how the opening scene of the movie (Martin Sheen in his Hanoi hotel room) really came about, with Sheen so drunk for real he couldn't stand up properly and then cutting his hand when he smashes the mirror but refusing to stop shooting, just wow. Then there are the scenes with Dennis Hopper, brought in at the last minute and unable to remember his lines. But the cherry of the cake is to see how utterly clueless and desparate Francis Coppola is when shooting scenes with Marlon Brando, as Coppola is trying to figure out a way to make sense and find an ending to the movie, improvising all along the way.

I am just floored by this documentary. It should be required viewing for anyone going to film school (maybe it is, I don't know). But for anyone who is a serious lover of movie history, this is required viewing, and you'll enjoy it immensely from start to finish.

The documentary details with great depth the difficulty of the shoot and the near despair and collapse of Coppola.  It is if hurdles were thrown at him from God.

3236683,5,B000XECFXS,"In his treatise on strategy and warfare, On War, Carl von Clausewitz explains that ""Everything in war is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult.""  He goes on to explain that ""the difficulties [in war] accumulate and end by producing a kind of friction that is inconceivable unless one has experienced war... Countless minor incidents - the kind you can never really forsee - combine to lower the general level of performance, so that one always fall far short of the intended goal. Iron will-power can overcome this friction; it pulverizes every obstacle, but of course it wears down the machine as well.""

Friction is the difference between real war and war on paper, he says.  It is the difference between the plans drawn up by political and military leadership and what actually happens on the battlefield.

The concept of friction, however, is applicable to any sort of planning exercise.  We've all planned events or projects that sounded great on paper, but once we began carrying them out, we realized it wasn't at all as we had initially hoped.  Remodeling a kitchen that went from being a summer project has now crept into Christmas time.  Or perhaps a project at work that ended up costing much more than originally anticipated.  Friction is all those little unforeseen delays, costs, and obstacles that impact the timeliness, price tag, and overall quality of a project or an event.

The practical implication of friction was beautifully illustrated in the film, Hearts of Darkness: a Filmmaker's Apocalypse, which documents the filming and production of Director Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now.  It shows how Coppola went into the filming of the project with such high hopes, but so many unforeseen variables, many of which were out of his control, ended up almost wrecking the project and ruining Coppola.

The filming of Apocalypse Now took place in the Philippines, which at the time was engaged in a civil war.  Coppola was renting helicopters from the Philippine government for one of the most famous scenes in the film.  However, filming was often interrupted because the government would take a few of the helicopters back to fight the rebels.  Martin Sheen, who played Captain Willard, the film's main protagonist, had a heart attack midway through the filming and needed several weeks to recover.  Typhoon Olga came through and destroyed much of the set and forced the closing of production.  And finally, Marlon Brando, earning a then-unprecedented $1M a week, arrived on set much overweight, not prepared, and unhappy about the ending.  The film ended up being $30M over budget and four times over schedule.  In a recorded phone conversation with his wife, Coppola confessed that he no idea what he was doing and even contemplated suicide.

In the end, Coppola successfully managed the immense friction of the production.  Apocalypse Now is arguably the best Vietnam War movie ever made and the film is one of the best in history.

But how did Coppola pull this off?  How did he overcome the insurmountable obstacles that were thrown at him and create a masterpiece?  In other words, as Clausewitz asks, ""Is there any lubricant that will reduce this abrasion?""  He immediately answers: ""Only one, and a commander and his army will not always have it readily available: combat experience... Habit hardens the body for great exertions, strengthens the heart in great peril, and fortifies judgment against first impressions. Habit breeds that priceless quality, calm, which... will lighten the commander's task.""

Clausewitz believes, thus, that experience is what reduces friction.  Experience is what instills a sense of realism into the outlook of an initiative.  An experienced leader understands that there will be problems that crop up and add delays and increase costs of the project.  Experience teaches him to not get ruffled by these problems and to take the unexpected in stride.  Experienced leaders not only maintain an even keel when the unforeseen hits, but also use it to their advantage through natural gestures and improvised courses of action.  The friction forces them to be innovation and creative.

By the time of the filming of Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola already had several Academy Awards under his belt.  He won Best Picture and Best Director Awards for The Godfather and The Godfather Part II; two other films he directed and produced, The Conversation and American Graffiti, respectively, were nominated for Best Picture; and he had won three Best Screenplay Awards.  Coppola had begun his film career 17 years earlier and was, at the time, at the peak of his career.  Needless to say he was an experienced film director.

In The Hearts of Darkness, you get to see how such an experienced professional and leader handles the immense friction that happened in the production of Apocalypse Now.  He improvised the entire beginning scene when Martin Sheen, who at the time was very drunk from a birthday celebration, punches the mirror in his hotel room in Saigon.  He worked around Marlon Brando's weight by dressing him in all black and only shooting him in the dark.  And lastly, he worked the torrential downpour from the tropical storm - it rained for many days straight - into the shooting.  I couldn't imagine the film without these improvisations!

Only a director of Coppola's experience and will power could have managed the magnitude of friction that was inherent in the production of Apocalypse Now and successfully turn it into one of the best films of all-time (and even he almost failed).",1312243200,5,5574,5.042576419213974
3236684,4,B000XECFXS,"Francis Ford Coppola's film APOCALYPSE NOW was one of the most infamously troubled productions in the history of Hollywood, so resonating in collective memory that it can still be parodied in recent films like TROPIC THUNDER. A typhoon struck the set in the Philippines, local officials were difficult to work with, Martin Sheen had a heart attack during filming, and Coppola was constantly troubled how to bring his script to a powerful ending. The 1991 documentary HEARTS OF DARKNESS: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse chronicles these trials and tribulations through audio recordings that Coppola's wife Eleanor made for her filming diary, informal footage of life on the set and interviews with cast and crew.

If all HEARTS OF DARKNESS did was rehash the same general trivia one can get from Wikipedia, like so many documentaries, it wouldn't be very good. I was pleased to find that it reveals a lot about the story that I never knew before. The genesis of the screen adaption of Joseph Conrad's novel in earlier attempts by Orson Welles and George Lucas is charted. Dennis Hopper's maniacal performance is placed in the context of his own nervousness at a career slump and his thankfulness that Coppola was giving him a second chance.

Perhaps the strongest point of the film is how it reveals the mind of someone tormented by his drive to create, and how a film can result from spontaneous choices on set that go far beyond any script. When the film was first shown at Cannes, Coppola said of the production ""little by little we went insane"", and indeed his highs of inspiration and lows of self-doubt are captured here. The opening of the film where Sheen's character drunkenly breaks a mirror and slumps, bleeding and crying next to his hotel room bed, is shown to have resulted from the cameras rolling when Sheen did drunkenly stumble on set.

Upon its 1991 release this documentary must have been even more interesting as it contains much footage that appeared only in the APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX director's cut in 2001: the French Plantation scene, the interlude in the abandoned, muddy camp, etc. I was surprised to hear Coppola insist on cutting the French Plantation scene because he was unsatisfied with the quality of the French actors and the lighting, not because of its place in the story. But what remains remarkable about HEARTS OF DARKNESS is that it betrays nothing of the scenes out of the 5-hour workprint that remain cut from commercial release, such as the prominent role given to Lt. Colby and his murder of the American photographer. There's also absolutely no shots of Harvey Keitel as Captain Williard before he was replaced.

This particular DVD release contains a second feature, ""Coda: 30 Years Later"", which documents Coppola's shooting of YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH in Romania in 2006.",1293667200,,2805,4.936440677966102
3236685,3,B000XECFXS,"Ha haha...sorry about the title of my review...I guess I need to get out more.

Anyway, I don't see how this is a 5 Star movie.  I was eager to see this behind-the-scenes look at the wild overruns in the making of ""Apocolypse Now"", but was I disappointed.  The documentary is a high level overview, glossing over key incidents  with little introspection.

So..ok...there was a hurricane, the Phillipine govt. borrowed back its helicopters for a day and Martin Sheen had a heart attack.  Clearly setbacks, but they don't add up to the debacle reportedly surrounding the making of ""Apocolypse Now"". As the footage is average, even these events do not raise this documentary above a typical ""making of"" film.

Narrative is added after the filming, so the it loses any ""you are there"" feeling.  The narrative has the typical pompous, self-important ring of people involved in the film and tends to break any tension that may be there. Francis Ford Coppola never admits to doing anything wrong or lessons learned from the experience, adding to the pomposity.

There is much that could have added needed drama ....Why was Harvey Keitel fired in the first two weeks? Also, we are told this, but not shown...imagine a documentary that showed the firing of a major star...now THAT would be five stars!  Or even the meeting where this decision was made.  However, there is only commentary on this and even that is missing key information.

Similarly, we are only told Francis Ford Coppola was surprised that Marlon Brando did not read the book, ""Heart of Darkness"", on which the movie is based and of Mr. Coppola's surprise at Mr. Brando's weight gain.  Watching these and other conversations between the high profile director and major star would have been great, but there is no filming of any exchange of dialogue between the two of them.  It's likely that one of them (take a guess) didn't allow these events to be filmed.  So, the Marlon Brando footage is mostly filmed from approximately 25 feet back and there are a few outtakes.

I imagine there was tremendous tension on the set, short tempers, illness, backstabbing...perhaps even marital strife between Francis Ford Coppola and his wife, who made the documentary.  I mean, is it actually possible that there was less tension in  making ""Apocolypse Now"" than in the reality program ""The Survivor""?

Ultimately, it's an adequate ""making of"" documentary on the caliber of the extra disk on a two-disc ""special"" release of a movie, hardly a landmark documentary on a landmark film.",1277683200,4,2528,4.905882352941177

The songs ""Suzie Q"" and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" have been replaced with some corny, cheap imitations--to save money, I suppose. Likewise, in one scene in the original version of the film, Francis Ford Coppola serenades a little girl sitting on his lap--the song? ""Anything Goes."" In the DVD version of the film, Coppola's singing has been removed, which makes the footage pointless. I don't know if the song was removed because of the potentially immoral implications, or due to more fees for the rights to the song ""Anything Goes."" Either way, I feel that someone has messed with a masterpiece. Of course the film is still great and should not be missed.

The interviews with Martin Sheen were superb as was the discussion of the peculiarities (and blatant irresponsibility) of Marlon Brando. The unkempt and passionate Coppola was something to see on the original set, and I had no idea the types of chances he took in the hopes of getting his film made. Also of interest, was the method by which the John Milius's original script was synced with the vision of Coppola.

3236689,3,B000XECFXS,"Hearts Of Darkness glosses over one of the more important aspects of the film's creation, the hiring and firing of the first actor, Harvey Keitel, to portray Lt. Willard. We are simply told it was not working, and cut to Francis's hiring of Martin Sheen. But, we never see any of the footage shot with Keitel, we never learn if he was simply too different from Francis's vision of Willard to work, or was he simply doing a poor job, a malcontent, or clashing too frequently with Francis. For a so-called documentary to leave such wide open says much of the aims of the documentarian, in this case Eleanor. Also left open-ended is a much talked about aspect of the filming that the documentary does not cover, and that is Francis's infidelity on the set, and how that contributed to the distance between the couple. How this affected Eleanor's documentary, much less Apocalypse Now, is certainly ripe for discussion. This is the rare instance where such is not mere gossip for gossip's sake, but pertinent information about the director's state of mind in the improvisatory aspects of the film. Was his film more gloomy because of the infidelity's consequences? Hearts Of Darkness does a great disservice to its viewers by totally avoiding such questions, even as it claims a rare intimacy, due to Eleanor's claim to have surreptitiously recorded conversations without Francis's knowledge.

Overall, the DVD package is barely worth an investment, especially if a Coppola fan, but once again the studio that put out the DVD could have offered so much more for so little an investment. Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse is a good and worthwhile 'Making Of' feature for a DVD release, but, as a stand alone documentary, it is rather lacking. Thus, with two making of documentaries, and no real feature, the package is saved by the aforementioned pluses alone. Better than nothing, but most viewers will wind up asking, 'Well, that's it?'

This film documents a man with a wish to bring Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" to the screen while bringing it up to date and satisfying a generation by making the War in Viet Nam his allegory.  The only real problem with the production of ""Apocalypse Now"" seems to be the man behind the project.  Francis Ford Coppola, coming off his well-deserved reputation from directing ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather II"" set out to make ""Apocalypse Now"" well before he was prepared to.  His artistic concepts seemed well-thought out but his inability to convey them to his chosen cast left him throwing out scenes because the actors just didn't get the idea.  Well, whose fault is that?  We get ""tragic"" stories about monsoons (What! In the Phillipines?!!!?), temporary losses of essential equiptment, unexplained cast changes, and many other causes of unfortold delays and cost over-runs.  This is the stuff of which comedies are made.  ""Day for Night"" is a great example of a movie made about making a movie.  It suceeds because the director is able to touch the audience with joy and sorrow while involving us with the characters.

I see, from the overwhelmingly favorable reviews, that many others would agree that ""The Heart of Darkness"" is a great film.  My guess is that they were of the opinion that ""Apocalypse Now"" was one of the great movies of all time and they just can't get enough of it or anything about it.  To me, nothing else makes sense.

3236692,4,B000XECFXS,"Like the other reviewers, I found this documentary to be fascinating.  If you are a Coppola fan, it's a can't miss.  That said, I have a couple of caveats to the unconditional raves given by other reviewers:  First, if you already have the VHS version, the DVD ""extras"" are pretty weak (of course, if you no longer have a VHS player, you may want to pick up a copy of the DVD anyway).  The ""Coda"" is actually about Francis's recent film ""Youth without Youth,"" not about looking back on the making of ""Apocalypse, Now"" from the present.  A good chunk of this short documentary consists of Francis reclining in bed pontificating about what turned out to be a pretty weak film.  Both Francis and Eleanor Coppola (Francis's wife) provide commentaries on ""Hearts of Darkness"" - the commentaries are mixed together, although recorded separately.  Unfortunately, neither commentary is very interesting.  Francis apparently contributed his mainly so he could assert multiple times that the unfavorable press he received while filming ""Apocalypse, Now"" was unfair.  He argues that he should have been seen as an artist risking his own money following a dream, rather than a filmmaker descending into psychosis.  Fair enough, but he didn't need to keep repeating the point, and after all these years with the film having turned out to be a huge critical and commercial success, why does he still care what the trade papers were writing about him 30 years ago?  In addition, the commentaries are pretty skimpy; there are long sections where the film plays with no commentary.  Francis passes on the opportunity to provide additional insight into such things as the replacement of Harvey Keitel with Martin Sheen during the early days of filming.  Second, although this documentary relied heavily on film shot by Eleanor during the making of ""Apocalypse, Now,"" she wasn't actually the director - Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper were.  Apparently, they were responsible for the interviews with all of the film's stars - except Brando, who refused to participate.  As far as I could tell, the two directors don't seem to receive credit on the commentary track.

HEARTS OF DARKNESS has moments that absolutely spellbind you, particularly the scenes with Brando as he basically riffs until stating that he has nothing left to say AND the scene where Martin Sheen basically melts down in front of our eyes as Coppola eggs it on.  What makes this so special is that you realize that both the film and the film about the film are rare gems that we may never see again.  There will never be another APOCALYPSE NOW--the times and the industry have radically changed.  ""Just recreate the jungle with CGI.""  And, there will not be another HEARTS OF DARKNESS.

The interesting thing about Apocalypse Now is that with probably over 1,000 reviews here on Amazon counting the different versions you could probably get a different interpretation for each review.  It's so good and so deep and has so many metaphors that it could mean any number of different things for viewers and nobody would be wrong.

I'm not going to try to analyze this documentary however because you have the people involved with this masterpiece giving their own perspectives on the doc.  What I will do is list some things I found interesting in hopes of generating some curiosity for people to see this fascinating work.

-  Harvey Keitel was originally cast to play Capt. Willard and was fired and replaced for Martin Sheen.

-  The part in the hotel room where Capt. Willard is spiraling out of control was just as much Sheen.  It was his 36th birthday he was drunk and actually punched and broke the glass mirror and broke down.

-  Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack while filming and was actually given his last rights, halting filming for a couple of months.

- Coppola mortgaged his own house and used his own money to make the film.

-  The boat going down river and the crew specifically Sam Bottoms character was actually under the influence of drugs while filming most of the time.

-  Some filming was shot during a typhoon that killed nearly 200 local people.

-  Hearts of Darkness was supposed to be Orson Welles first movie instead he did Citizen Kane when it fell through.

-  Some of the script was written and altered by Coppola while filming influenced by his dreams and most of the movie he did not have an ending for.

-  A civil war was taking place in parts of the Philippines while shooting and helicopters used for the film from the Philippine govt had to be taken straight out of filming and into battle.

3236695,5,B000XECFXS,"And you thought you had a bad day at the office! Francis Ford Coppola went way up the river (and pretty much around the bend) during the making of ""Apocalypse Now"", and his wife Eleanor was there to watch (while shooting some of her own footage, and at times, even secretly recording intimate conversations with her hubby). Writer-directors Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper took this raw material and assembled an amazing, intense documentary that takes the viewer about as uncomfortably close to the utter madness of filmmaking as most of us would care to get. Many feel that this film is even better than ""Apocalypse"" itself. This DVD includes a new documentary about the making of Coppola's recent theatrical release ""Youth Without Youth"". Gluttons for punishment might consider a double-bill with Les Blank's ""Burden of Dreams"".",1203033600,2,832,5.125

Despite being aware of the final result which is APOCALYPSE NOW itself you'll feel the tension and unease about what will eventually happen and that I think is HEARTS OF DARKNESS triumph. It's a miracle a movie that good came out of this whole situation but for me, the film's weak link is the Brando part and after seeing the level of irresponsibility he showed during filming, it's far from surprising. To Coppola's credit, he made the best from what he had.
I read a review of this DVD and came very close to not buying it due to the suppossed mediocrity of video and audio. All I can say is that it looks exactly the way it should.",1199750400,5,911,4.396449704142012

I have been looking for this movie on DVD for years and I am really glad it is finally available. Apocaypse Now is one of the best movies of all time and this documentary only increases your appreciation for the movie. The scene where Martin Sheens character flips out and breaks a mirror and starts smearing the blood all over himself is all the more powerfull when you realize that that wasn't scripted and is actually his blood. He had actually cut himself pretty badly.,1196640000,,629,4.384615384615385
3236699,5,B000XECFXS,"HEARTS OF DARKNESS is one of the few documentaries on film making where you get to see a true artistic process.  After watching this, you will find nearly all ""Making of..."" pieces found on DVDs for what they really are:  marketing fluff.  As a result, I eagerly watched HEARTS OF DARKNESS on DVD after last seeing it more than 10 years ago.  I was very nervous that Coppola would be releasing a butchered form of the documentary.  After all, he bares his soul in a way that few real artists do in public -- the picture of him holding a gun to his head (and not all in fun) is pretty intense stuff.

I am happy to report that the whole film is here, there doesn't appear to any cuts and the run time (96 minutes) matches that of the official times listed on the Internet. Thank you, Francis!

Now to the DVD extra, an hour-long documentary called CODA: THIRTY YEARS LATER.  It's this new documentary (40% of the total DVD content!) which explains why Coppola is finally re-releasing HOD.  The title ""CODA"" it misleading (especially in this context) because CODA has nothing to do with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/B000FSME1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>.  Rather it is a documentary on Coppola's newest film YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH.  Perhaps because YWY looks to be an essential parlor piece with lots of dialog, CODA is, unfortunately, tedious.  In fact, YWY has not yet been given a wide release in the US, so what we really have here is a (you guessed it) ""Making of..."" film for marketing purposes.  Sure, it would have made a great extra on the YWY DVD, but it is a huge letdown after HEARTS OF DARKNESS.  In fact, CODA didn't leave me wanting to see YWY and initial professional reviews reveal that the film itself is a letdown.

Instead, rejoice that Coppola decided to re-release HEARTS OF DARKNESS to home video to market his new film.  Every single student of film should see HOD -- it is also a perfect companion piece to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-La-Mancha/dp/B000096FUD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in La Mancha</a>, another documentary that shows that most of Hollywood isn't the glitz that it sells.

8228133,5,B000XECFXS,"Released in 1991, ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse"" chronicles the making of 1979s Apocalypse Now, combining footage shot by Eleanor Coppola during the shooting of the film with more recent interviews with the cast & crew.

Documentaries or commentaries on how a particular film was made don't interest me because Im not a filmmaker and only care about the final product. As a writer and former musician Im familiar with the creative process and understand how some ideas fail to deliver the goods and must be thrown out, etc. As an example, I heard some demos of a couple of my favorite songs and they were lousy compared to the final product and almost ruined my view of those songs. This explains why Im generally not interested in the harrowing details of how my favorite movies were made and the parts that were thrown out, etc. This documentary is an exception because (1.) Apocalypse Now is my all-time favorite movie (the original theatrical version, that is) and (2.) the documentary is just so well-done. In fact, its fascinating from beginning to end.

Hearts of Darkness shows the monumental problems Coppola and crew encountered in making the movie: The sudden firing of their leading man (Harvey Keitel) after three weeks of shooting and replacing him with Martin Sheen; the delays in filming due to the Philippine Army taking back their rented helicopters to quell an uprising; a hurricane that ruins the sets; Sheen having a heart attack at only 36 years of age and the corresponding delay; overweight Brando arriving to the set totally unprepared and making $1 million a week with an unwritten, improvised ending; the amusing tiger incident; Francis venting in genuine uncertainty at various stages of the creative process, particularly the entire ending; etc.

The interviews with cast and crew are also very informative and entertaining, like Frederic Forrests commentary on the tiger sequence and John Milius insights on his original screenplay and his encounter with Francis during filming where the latter convinced him that itd be the first film to win the Nobel prize.

This documentary came out ten years before the Redux version of the film was released and, as such, it was the publics first glimpse of various scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor, like the French Plantation sequence and the typhoon-with-the-bunnies sequence. In my opinion, Redux is a failure and those scenes shouldve never been inserted into the movie as very little of the added footage works, but those sequences ARE interesting as deleted scenes or viewing them (in part) in the context of Hearts of Darkness.

For some good laughs, be sure to check out the spoof of this documentary: Hearts of Hot Shots Part Deux: A Filmmaker's Apology, which was released in 1993 and is available on Youtube in a couple parts.

The film runs 96 minutes.

8228139,5,B000XECFXS,"Apocalypse Now is my favourite movie and as one fellow reviewer says correct  I am a fanatic.
I also love Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse (Hearts of Darkness) and cannot understand how so many people are commenting on Apocalypse Now Redux and yet have not watched Hearts of Darkness. For example one reviewer who gave the original movie 5 star asks
 I wonder why Coppola deleted the French Plantation scene from the original movie?
One important aspect of Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse is that there is Commentary to the Commentary. Blink and you will miss it. That is Eleanor Coppola actually comment on the documentary. Fans of Francis will get an important insight into the man. For example, he is to this day embarrassed about certain scenes in Apocalypse Now. We are not directly told which scenes but Eleanor hints at which ones.
Like some reviewers, I remember the original release of Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse as being longer and more in depth. Eleanor Coppola answers this by saying that she did not want to embarrass Martin Sheen (Captain Willard) about his real heart attack and there was more discussion about narcotics. I agree with Eleanor as she says talking about drugs detracts from the documentary.
I think its fantastic that a documentary exists on possibly (and I highlight possibly) the greatest movie made. I could not believe it when I heard in 1991 that Hearts of Darkness existed, Eleanor goes on to say that people like myself, people in the early teens when Apocalypse Now a released in 1979 urger her and Francis to release Hearts of Darkness.
John Milius: wrote part of the script. ALL the parts concerning John Milius are extremely humorous, especially, his preferred ending where  this rime I will NOT spoil this scene. You have to watch it to believe and the fact that George Lucas was initially going to film it. Wow .
The documentary ends with Francis reflecting on movie making and says words to these effect a .. a fat girl from Ohio will probably beat a well-known director/cinematographer by using a hand held camera.
 Francis does not have to worry for the following reasons:
 Apocalypse Now will never be re-made, OR, more importantly have a sequel

 The cinematography is so beautiful and perfect that CGI cannot duplicate or replace it

 Labour Of Love:  Apocalypse Now was such a personal labour of love for Francis that no studio to this day would allow a director that much autonomy. (Francis suffered greatly due to Apocalypse Now and his other hit Dracula 11-12 years later was filmed indoors on massive studio lots and sound stages)

Once again if you are a hard core fan, there is so much in Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse that a 7,000 word review would not do it justice AND hopefully clarifies the three points above.  There are interviews with all the actors. You will laugh out loud at the parts that contain Dennis Hopper and Marlon Brando. Perseverance.  The one thing that I learned from the documentary and the movie Apocalypse Now is persevere until the end.  All fans owe it Francis who put everything on the line  admits he was frightened . to bring us  the timeless masterpiece,
Apocalypse Now.",1429920000,3,3212,4.823315118397086
