3611824,5,B001GJ4U5K,"Anything having to do with ""Best Friends Animal Sanctuary"" is an automatic 5-Star in my book!  Best Friends is an incredible place for all the unwanted animals that humans so easily discard or abuse.  I only hope that I can actually visit the Sanctuary at some point in time.  The DVD verifies everything I've stated here.",1235260800,4,322,4.714285714285714
3611825,3,B001GJ4U5K,I like DogTown. It is full of amazing stories of animals who need assistance to make it in this world.,1381190400,,102,4.15
3611826,5,B001GJ4U5K,I love this series and this season.  The employees of Dog Town are interesting and compelling; they love dogs and are doing wonderful work with them.,1373932800,,149,4.730769230769231
3611827,5,B001GJ4U5K,"So sorry Dog Town was taken off the air but while watching the series I realized some of their stories were over several months. That can't be cheap to do. But the series did accomplish Best Friends getting a lot of publicity and that is a great thing for the animals they save. As I watch this show I'm amazed at the lengths these people go to help these animals. While this series only covers dogs, check out their website and see how many other animals they help. Truly compassionate people.",1371254400,,494,4.43956043956044
3611828,3,B001GJ4U5K,"This is the only DogTown episode the I've not given 5 stars to simple due to its subject matter - the Michael Vick dogs.  Numerous parts of the episode show some of the more unpleasant aspects of dog fighting and the resulting damage to the dogs.  There is nothing gruesome shown, however, I had to look away from the television several times and was left with an overall feeling of anger and sadness for what these poor dogs had to go through while owned by Mr. Vick.

Of course the staff at Best Friends was able to help the dogs both physically and emotionally, but were also fully aware that these innocent creatures will carry, both physically and emotionally, the scars of their violent past for the rest of their lives.",1370390400,,726,4.526717557251908
3611829,5,B001GJ4U5K,"I watched this episode to find the name of an illness one of the dogs had.  I thought my pitbull might have obeshia.  i don't know if the spelling is correct.  Anyway, I watched it mostly with my eyes closed as they kept showing dogs fighting.  That makes me sick as it is descusting and I cant forgive anyone that would put any animal through something like that.  Having a pitbull and knowing how loving they are breaks my heart that they can be treated so cruely  I am so thankful for dogtown that helped these dogs get a better life.  Keep up the goood work Dogtown.  Yes, my pitty is a rescue and he was dumped after he was tortured. It took some vet care and rehabilitation, but he is living with 3 other dogs and a cat with no problems for the last 8yrs.",1365638400,,761,4.164383561643835
3611830,5,B001GJ4U5K,"I first was able to go to Best Friends Animal Society in mid Sept of 2010. But sadly due to time change between AZ and UT unable to arrive in time for the free tour which would have allowed me to see Dog Town. The series was taped at Best Friends by National Geographic film crews.  But this DVD set allowed me to see I am pretty sure areas of the kennels, and vet clinic.  As well as the inside look of the lives of the men & woman who help these dogs not shown on any tour.

The dogs these people help weather through training, patience or just the love for these poor dogs shows in these episodes.

Be warned it also shows the story of a few of the Michael Vick dogs that Best Friends rescued. 44 of the dogs found homes and a new life thanks to Best Friends. Some may never leave the place, but at least they are loved and cared for.  These Pit Bulls only did what was asked of them from their owners. As I have learned since this watching this it's the deed that should be punished, not the breed.

Be warned actual footage of dog fighting is shown in this episode due to fact the case was the first real look the world got of Dog Fighting.  Also a certain piece of equipment was used on one dog, and the fact a veterinarian who was supposed to protect animals did a horrible thing to one female dog.",1288396800,,1305,4.07421875
3611831,4,B001GJ4U5K,"Because of its length, you pretty much have to be a serious dog lover to stick with and appreciate this series, which recounts multiple episodes of rescue, rehabilitation and retraining of neglected, wounded or misbehaving canines of all shapes, sizes and ages.  Most of these doggies are pretty cute and appealing.  The caregivers, themselves, are an attractive and idealistic bunch who are clearly making major contributions to animal (and by extension human) welfare.  The Michael Vick saga plays a role in all of this and adds to the up-to-date feel of the film.",1255651200,8,566,5.064516129032258
3611832,5,B001GJ4U5K,"First, I want to address the price issue.  I was wondering myself when I purchased this set why it is so much more expensive than the first one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-Dogtown-Second-Chances/dp/B0016OM3X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic: Dogtown - Second Chances</a>.  Here's the answer: this one has 5 episodes.  Second Chances has three.

In these 5 episodes, watchers get a very in depth look at leg amputations and how they affect the dog, the therapy involved, the surgery.  I especially liked watching the determined pooches do the underwater treadmill.  Episode one has a leg amputation as does episode five.  The second episode introduces a very loveable, but very hurt dalmation.  This one is not for the faint of heart, as his wounds get treated and restitched.  Neither is a tumor case in episode five.  Both of these dogs were rescued from two separate hoarding situations.  (That crazy cat lady is no longer a laughing matter, people!)  Episode three is about the much publicized Michael Vick dogs.  The Vick dogs are pit bulls that have been trained to fight and have never known a loving or kind hand in their lives.. until now.  There was one particular dog in this episode that touched my heart, Cherry.  Cherry has self esteem issues as a result of having been a ""bait"" dog.  Cherry also educates DogTown and its viewers about a disease called Babesia, much similiar to the human HIV.

My own dogs want to give a ""bark out"" to Knightly from episode four.  I kid you not when I say they perked up and paid attention everytime this loveable weimaraner came on screen.  His human parents grew too old and frail to take care of him.  DogTown sees he gets a new home.

Why do I need to go live in Oregon? Cause all my favorite dogs on this show end up in Oregon!

An added bonus that certainly doesn't hurt this shows 5 star rating is the adorable, cute, sexy John Garcia.  I think Paul Walker has some competition.",1254614400,8,2014,4.981981981981982
3611833,5,B001GJ4U5K,A heartwarming video about the realities of abandoned and needy dogs. After watching this you will understand the need for more resonsible pet care and want to help Best Friends in their effort to make a difference.,1251417600,2,215,4.837837837837838
3611834,5,B001GJ4U5K,"I had the pleasure of spending a few days volunteering at ""Best Friends Animal Sanctuary"" this past summer.  It is the most amazing place in the world!  The animals and employees are like a family. Each wonderful dog, cat, bird, horse etc. is known by name and is given so much love that I had a very hard time leaving each day.  ""Dogtown"" is a wonderful series and I am so happy that Best Friends and the staff are finally receiving the acknowledgement they deserve.  I hope to make volunteering there an annual pilgrimage! I urge all viewers to visit and to volunteer, if possible.",1250467200,3,583,4.523809523809524

8305669,5,B001GJ4U5K,"Love this!
This series really shows the love and commitment that goes into the training and rehab of supposedly un-adoptable dogs.  The positive reinforcement methods do work and they prove it time and again.  Their dedication is amazing!",1446508800,,238,5.2368421052631575

8305671,5,B001GJ4U5K,"While the events that brought the Vicktory dogs to DogTown were horrendous, to see the love, care, compassion, and patience the Best Friends community gave them was so heart-warming.  Those that participate in dog fighting should be locked away forever, and certainly not allowed to go on to make millions playing a sport they love (goes without saying who I'm referring to).  Knowing  there are people like those at Best Friends restores your faith in humanity.",1418860800,,462,5.052631578947368

If you missed them on NatGeo you can get them here to revisit the gentle caring of the animal care-givers and how they gently bring abused, scared dogs back into happiness and joy. Wonderful!",1399507200,,257,4.711111111111111
