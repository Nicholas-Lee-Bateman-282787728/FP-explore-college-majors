8678528,2,B00NJ1Z1ZG,"The story ""The Best of Care"" was NOT included in this film, which I purchased.  Further, be warned, the film is gay-themed.  The plot stumbles along with the guys playing scary jokes on each other for most of the 55 minutes.  No SFX to speak of.  No Blood, no gore.  Typical ""grindhouse"" scratchy film effects.  White outs and yellow outs of the film to simulate age.  I'm not happy.  Apparently, the director has suffered for his films, and now it was my turn.  :-(",1451779200,,466,4.4523809523809526
