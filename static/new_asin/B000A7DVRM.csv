2377636,4,B000A7DVRM,"My daughter is 2 and loves this movie, she's enjoyed it since she was 1.  The care bears look very cute in cgi form.  The songs are decent, there's nothing scary, there's a good lesson although it takes a while to get to it.  Perfect for a toddler-age group.  However, i have to say when i was a kid, the care bears were way less wimpy than these.  In the old 80s movies, they fought evil villains, had special powers, and helped people on earth who were lonely & troubled.  Here they face very non-confrontational problems that affect only them.  They seem a little watered-down.  But after screening the 2 original care bear movies from the 80s, i couldn't recommend them for children under 5, due to some frightening scenes.  This movie is a better choice for little ones.",1390953600,,775,4.517985611510792

2377640,4,B000A7DVRM,"This movie is MUCH better than ""Journey to Joke A Lot"". The Care Bears stay in Care A Lot this time and the focus is on caring for and thinking about others rather than just yourself. The central character is Wish Bear but all of the other care bears play a part, including three new bears. This movie was much more tolerable than the first CGI. I still don't like it as much as the 80s movies (where's the Care Bear Stare for example) but it's a cute movie.",1360713600,,458,4.157303370786517

2377647,5,B000A7DVRM,"I was looking for a better Care Bears movie, one better than Joke-a-Lot. I really liked the CGI animation, and as other reviewers mentioned, this movie had absolutely no unnecessary or bad words, no evil characters, just nice and lovely bears which my toddler likes so much! I really don't want my baby to watch anything which would contain any kind of violence, rude behavior or language, and it's hard to find cartoons which are completely innocent and cute in the same time. The Big Wish movie is one of them, it's so nice and colorful and so much fitting for an innocent child's imagination. I like that it has a good moral too, to care for others! Among other new Care Bears movies, this is the most pleasant. I don't like Joke-a-lot, because of those grotesque characters and other movies also have some evil characters. I would recommend this one.",1330300800,,854,4.662251655629139

2377649,5,B000A7DVRM,"It is hard for me to give this a 5 star given that I have watched it basically every day for the last 2 months.  My two girls love this movie and when they aren't watching it they are giving each other the care bear stare or rubbing belly badges or stealing belly badges or singing about wishes.  This movie really struck home with the girls (2 & 4 yrs old) it has really unlocked their imagination and created some great playtime when the TV is off.  I highly recommend for any care bears fan.

It is also worth noting that this is the newer CGI style carebears and that some of the older 80's stuff is actually a little creapy and not ideal for 2yr olds.  I recommend sticking to the newer stuff for the little ones.",1326067200,,718,4.173913043478261

2377651,5,B000A7DVRM,"My niece loved it, and I think her mom loved it more.  It had a nice story line and it is very nice that there are still movies for kids that teach them values not how to grow up to fast.",1296777600,,187,3.5609756097560976
2377652,5,B000A7DVRM,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter really likes the Care Bears. But the other animated series and films are too complex and sometimes inappropriate for her age group (except Journey to Joke-A-Lot but that one didn't hold her interest). She loves this movie and will say many lines along with it. There are no villains, and it's all about Care Bears and how they learn and grow, with many fun songs and total cuteness along the way.

In the newer Care Bears films made after this one there were some scenes in them that bothered her; she was upset when the villain got tied to a chair and said ""they're hurting him!"" and she was also upset about a large robot cleaning machine that kept trying to clean the bears because she thought it was hurting them.

So for now, this one is the one and only!",1296259200,,787,4.346938775510204

2377654,3,B000A7DVRM,"I bought this for my 6 month old twins because they LOVE the original CareBears movie2.

This looked colorful and even though I don't think the new bears are a cute as the old ones, I wanted to give it a try.

My twins were not interested in this, it just isn't as cute as the old movies. Plus the New style of Care Bears are kind of snotty acting.

This was ok but I wouldn't recommend it. Go with the Old Style CareBears.",1255910400,,423,4.011904761904762

It's in the DVD player in the car, and she won't let me switch it for another movie - she's been watching it for weeks now, and still loves it.  She's singing the songs (one or two of which are actually pretty good), and she loves Twinkers (the wishing star).  I'm going to get her the other movies since she loves this one so much.",1212192000,,434,4.08235294117647
2377659,4,B000A7DVRM,My daughter (2) is a HUGE care bears fan and LOVES this movie.  She knows all the songs and sings with them.  She always asks for this Teddies Big Wish (what she calls it)  She seems to like the newer ones rather then the older movies/shows.  The colors are more vibrant.  I wouldn't exactly recommend it for an adult but my 2yo loves it.  My boys (7 and 5) watch it too.,1196812800,,371,4.083333333333333
2377660,5,B000A7DVRM,"My 2-year daughter absolutely loves this DVD!!  She owns about 5 Care Bear stuffed animals, which come with a free DVD which are low quality 30-minute cartoons.  This DVD, on the other hand, is a full-length movie using modern animation and it grabbed my daughter's attention immediately. The story is sugary sweet as is typical of Care Bears stories, but I think it demonstrates good lessons for children.  Very appropriate for the youngest crowd. I wish there was more of a soundtrack because my daughter loves music; there are only 2 or 3 songs throughout the entire movie. OVerall, I highly recommend this item.",1178236800,,615,4.894230769230769
2377661,1,B000A7DVRM,"I only watched this movie to see how bad it would be. Unfortunately I was proved right. I absolutely loved the original care bear movies from the 80's but this was awful compared to them. To borrow an old saying: ""out with the new in with the old"".",1176940800,,248,4.1875

(and i'm an adult) I know i don't have much of a life but still i recommend this dvd not just for kids but adults as well because I think the message within the movie applies to everybody not just children. It's not quite the carebears you remember from the 80's but they are still all about caring for everybody. I think we could all use that once in a while esp. now with everything that is going on in the world. don't you?",1175299200,,479,4.052631578947368

2377664,5,B000A7DVRM,"My 2-year old daughter prefers this Care Bears movie to ""Joke-a-Lot,"" probably because this movie is all Care Bears and there are no distractions coming from other characters or creatures.

This movie is totally harmless, non-violent, and perfect fare for toddlers, plus the morals are something anyone could agree with.",1169078400,8,320,5.4

2377666,5,B000A7DVRM,We also taped this from the TV and soon our tape will wear out! My 3 year old girl loves this movie. I missed the Care Bear craze growing up and was actually surprised that the movie was so cute and so positive. I didn't realize the strong positive message behind the bears. Now I'm a big fan. I noticed stuffed toys with dvd's in the stores lately and we've aked Santa for one. We are hooked on Care Bears now. :),1162080000,,414,4.060975609756097
2377667,2,B000A7DVRM,"The carebears big wish movie was horrible.  THey never should have used CGI to make what use to be a wonderful show.  I'm scarred i'm scarred for life there is just no other explination for it.  They killed the carebears!  The carebears big wish move is on disney right now and it has gone CGI.  WTF they ruined it.  They really killed them there colors are all wrong( cheer bear isn't even pink and tenderheart isn't brown),the only facial expressions that they can do is open and close there eyes and mouths, Carealot looks like a barren wasteland instead of warm cuddles of clouds and joy,and the stars look like demon monsters.  I hate it.  What have they done!  Carebears are suppose to be cute and fluffy and cuddly and not look like emotionless statutes.  I hate CGI with cartoons i prefer animation.  sure live action special effects use cgi but leave my cartoons alone **crys**  WHAT HAVE THEY DONE!",1143244800,4,908,4.60625
2377668,5,B000A7DVRM,"This movie is a fun story about how to work together to solve problems, instead of trying to do it by yourself with magic.  It shows how things can get worse by going it alone.

2377671,3,B000A7DVRM,"This  movie is great, and my 3 yr. loves it, but as for the DVD itself, for some reason it won't allow you to repeat chapters, entire movie or use the a/b function on your remote to repeat a smaller part of the movie. I have tryed on 3 different dvd players, and still nothing. This may sound nitpicky, but if your a parent, you understand how a little one will find a certain song, or part of a movie, and want to watch it over, and over, and NOT being able to repeat the dvd is very frustrating( when your used to it on other dvds)- So just a word of caution on the no repeat--",1137283200,4,579,3.948717948717949
2377672,5,B000A7DVRM,"Big Wish is one of the best Care Bear movies made in a while. I saw the last one, Journey to Joke-A-Lot and was nearly soured on trying this one because of the poor quality of the last one. But I'm glad I saw it, it was really really good. I particularly like the song ""It Takes You and Me."" And even though it still has a small case of Me-Syndrome, it still had a good message and at least came close to what the Care Bears were originally meant to be. I grew up with the Care Bears and I am STILL a big fan, so I reccomend this for anyone who has an hour or two to spare.",1136419200,2,573,3.783333333333333

2377674,3,B000A7DVRM,"At first I was rather disappointed, but then I noticed how intently my son watched this movie.  The bright colors and friendly voices seem to really draw him in, and, cheesy and it may seem, there's a mood message to the story.  My son would sit and watch this movie repeatedly if I let him.  I personally am not a big fan, but if it keeps my usually very busy son occupied, then it can't be too awful.",1131148800,3,402,4.128205128205129
2377675,5,B000A7DVRM,"""Big Wish Movie"" is the second ""Care Bears"" CGI feature and it's even better than the first, with great features for the DVD! Although Wish Bear is the main focus of this feature, all of the Care Bears are present and there's three new friends as well!

The film opens with a great sequence in which we see Wish Cub meeting her good friend Twinkers for the first time. She lures him out of hiding with some sandwich crumbs and they make fast friends. Wish Cub wishes that they could be together forever and at first, Twinkers misunderstands and sticks himself to her tummy. Wish Cub clarifies and so she gains her tummy symbol and a new friend.

Back in the present-day Care-a-Lot, we see that this was a story that Wish Bear was telling the Care Bears. The next day, Wish Bear is out and about using Twinkers' power to help her friends. At least --- that's what she wants to do, but what she doesn't know is that all of her wishes are actually creating disasters. When it comes time for the Care-a-Lot Steering Committee meeting --- there's a startling announcement. It turns out that the Care-o-Meter that measures how much caring there is in Care-a-Lot has been trending towards the ""not-so-much"" side. The Care Bears decide to have a special ""Show How Much You Care"" month. It's generally agreed that this is a good idea, but Wish Bear is left feeling bit upset because she didn't know her friends didn't like her wishes. She wishes for some new friends and lo-and-behold, three new bears appear in Care-a-Lot. I won't spoil their grand entrance here --- you're going to have to see this to believe it!

Big Wish Movie features five new songs --- ""Big Wish Theme,"" ""I Wish,"" ""Get a Lot,"" ""It Takes You and Me"" and ""The Power of Wishing."" The movie is staffed by many of the same cast and crew who did the first CGI feature, ""Journey to Joke-a-Lot"" (and there's a nice, brief nod to this feature in this movie as well) and many new staff as well. I thought the voices were generally well chosen and the music was absolutely performed. ""Get a Lot"" is a hilarious stand-out, while ""I Wish"" is a touching solo piece performed by Wish Bear. And for those who have seen the show ""Franklin"" --- see if you can figure out who's voicing the star Big Wish before seeing her name in the closing credits.

The DVD special features are as follows:

Care-o-Meter --- This special feature is intertwined throughout. As you take part in different ""caring activities"" (and watching the movie counts as one), the meter rises until it hits 4 and then you are automatically taken to a very nice bonus, which I again won't spoil here.

Audio --- There's no close-captioning for this film, but you can get subtitles. The are also Spanish and French audio tracks.

Caring Activities --- There are three ""Caring Activities"" that allow you to raise the ""Care-o-Meter"" --- Build a House, Sing Along (Vocals and No Vocals) and Rocket Hunt. The first one allows you to assemble the house that the Care Bears made for the three new bears. There are five pieces to choose from, but only three go on the house. This didn't seem very intuitive to me because the pictures were a bit small, but it was still kinda fun.

Sing Along --- This is pretty nice. It's actually only a sing-along for one of the songs, but it's a good choice --- ""I Wish."" Both versions display the lyrics of the song with bright yellow lettering at the bottom and Twinkers bouncing along with the lyrics. Selecting the No Vocals option allows for a sort of karaoke, although it's not entirely vocals-free because although Wish Bear's singing is removed, the backup singers remain.

Rocket Hunt --- Fairly straightforward. The player takes off in Grumpy Bear's rocket and searches behind stars for objects in space. They then do one last search to find Big Wish. Very simple game, but still worth the while, I thought.

Trailers --- There are quite a few trailers. You can't select them individually and they play before the menu comes up, but you can fast forward or skip them. The trailers are for ""The Koala Brothers"" on DVD and Video, ""Maya and Miguel"" on DVD, ""Spookley the Square Pumpkin"" on DVD, ""Clifford the Big Red Dog"" on DVD and video, ""Journey to Joke-a-Lot"" on DVD and video, ""Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends"" on DVD and video, ""Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever"" on DVD and video and finally ""Pinocchio 3000"" on DVD and video. I hadn't seen any of these trailers before and so I was surprised to learn that there's going to be a new CGI ""Inspector Gadget"" release, as well as a new spin on Pinocchio.

DVD Credits --- Ah, this is nice, because you don't usually get this. A special credits section for all of the people who worked on the DVD.

Overall, I can't really see anything to complain about with this DVD. It's top-notch in every way.",1130112000,17,4807,4.576744186046511

The songs are great and not overly cheesy like some songs from the previous 3D care bears flick & the animation is good. The film contains no bad words, evil characters or even insults(!) but yet AMAZINGLY enough manages to be funny & not so sugary you'd want the last 75 minutes of your life back. It has cute characters & jokes in all the right places with tons of bright colors. Also the special features are fantastic as it features a sing-a-long to the best song from the movie with a vocals or no vocals option, 2 games, a special feature you get when you complete the caring activities (the games), tons of trailers, 5.1 & 2.0 dolby digital surround sound which are also available in spanish, & animated interactive menus.
