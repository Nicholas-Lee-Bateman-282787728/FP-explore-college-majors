7827275,1,6302543967,"you don't want this one if you're a fan of this movie. It's WAY overpriced, and is the abbreviated version shown on American TV.
What one wants, is the British 2 tape version, that's uncut, and twice as long. This one is a joke.",1439769600,,228,4.204545454545454

Is it available on DVD?",1353456000,,110,4.0
7827278,5,6302543967,Richard Chamberlain was superb in this movie - the twist at the end remains in my memory.  An aging Casanova realizes the woman he's trying to seduce may actually be his daughter.  His realization of this is a remarkable piece of acting.  Well worth hunting down the original film.,1332806400,,281,4.6938775510204085
7827279,5,6302543967,Good entertainment but note that it is the rather sterile American version - it was much more explicit for UK distribution,1321315200,,122,4.857142857142857
7827280,5,6302543967,"This moviw has great performances, a wonderful script that balances action and romance, gorgeous sets and costumes and a haunting, lovely soundtrack that stays in my mind long after the movie ends. Why no DVD release?  I'd love an unedited DVD release, since the VHS appears to have been cut.

ETA:  I so want a DVD release of this and WITH an isolated music score.  I periodically look for both the dvd and the soundtrack, or even for Michel Legrand to put out some  mp3s of this lovely score -- he has other of his work available on Amazon.  Why not this???",1283990400,,559,4.431372549019608
7827281,5,6302543967,"Some people argue over who the best James Bond or Doctor Who is. Well, concerning Casanova there is no contest. Richard Chamberlain was and will forever be my favorite Casanova. I liked how the two hour movie breaks Casanova's life into three parts with a young actor playing him in his teens and twenties and Chamberlain taking over the last two-thirds his life.

Chamberlain's portrayal of Casanova was leaps and bounds ahead of Heath Ledger's portrayal. That is not a knock on the brilliant Ledger. The script Ledger had was nothing to write home about. Nevertheless, the movie was a delight to watch. The VHS I have does contain some brief nudity, but according to some other reviewers even the 122 minute version I have is a censored version. Perhaps, but I also remember seeing the movie when it was originaly aired in 1987 and there was nothing even remotely close to nudity broadcast on that prime time ABC show. So I'm content with what I have. But if in a few years someone comes out with an unedited DVD version I will be the first in line to buy it!

This is a Five-Star production because the writing, directing and acting are all A+. The female co-stars are absolutely beautiful! The emotion Chamberlain shows after being duped by the woman he loves was believable and hits any man hard. We've all been there, guys! Yes, overall I can think of no other Casanova production in the last 25-30 years that can compare to this one.

7827282,4,6302543967,I love Richard Chamberlain but I can agree that this video has been made less than it's original.,1266969600,,97,4.444444444444445
7827283,3,6302543967,"I remember watching this movie on ABC in 1987, and the videocassette version has been edited in several places.  In fact, I think (though Amazon doesn't give running times) that the VHS version is considerably shorter than the broadcast version, which clocked in at 143 minutes; the European VHS release was 168 minutes long and there's a Japanese laserdisc version which is a whopping 174 minutes.  Also, if you go by Playboy magazine's 1988 pictorial on the movie, there was a considerable amount of nudity which didn't make it (of course) into the original U.S. broadcast version, or (less explicably) into the VHS release.  It seems that the bare female flesh was reserved for the European version.  If and when this movie is put on DVD, I hope we'll get the full, uncut version.  It's a sumptuously shot movie with a lot of gorgeous actresses (Faye Dunaway, Sylvia Kristel, Hanna Schygulla) as well as the reliable Richard Chamberlain in the title role, and deserves a proper DVD version.",1131840000,12,993,4.886904761904762
