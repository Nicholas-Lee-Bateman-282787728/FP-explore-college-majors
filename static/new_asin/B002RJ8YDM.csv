3974486,5,B002RJ8YDM,"It's rare to find someone who is a self-taught genius. On his own, he has dogs figured out. Moreover, own his own, he has figured out how to repair human-dog relationships. As society becomes more modern, we have forgotten how to live with our canine companions. Mr. Milan's goal is to repair this relationship, one human at a time. Hail, Cesar!",1323302400,4,345,4.672131147540983
3974487,1,B002RJ8YDM,"After purchasing seasons 1-3 and season 4 parts 1 and 2 which were labeled as such, I was aggravated to find this was only episodes 1-14 of season 5; not anywhere near the entire season! I'm getting pretty fed up with this type of false advertising (it's not just Dog Whisperer DVDs). My order said ""Dog Whisperer, season 5"" and I got ""Dog Whisperer, season 5, except episodes 15 - 23"".",1319414400,73,386,4.450704225352113
3974488,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I have this plus all the other seasons of the Dog Whisperer. I have learned so much from these videos. Of course, every dog is different, so you can't use the same techniques on every dog. I've taught my little dog to heel at my side and not pull on the leash with these techniques. It takes time. But it does work. You just have to make sure that your intensity is the same as the dog's intensity. Trying to coerce a dog who is super excited using gentle techniques is not going to work. Likewise, being too forceful with a timid dog is most likely going to wreck the dog. Watching these videos has helped me to become a better observer of my dog to see what his intensity level is so I can match it better so that he understands the point with just one word from me.",1316822400,,768,4.126666666666667
3974489,5,B002RJ8YDM,Love to watch what approach Cesar takes to correct the dogs behavior... Every case is different and interesting... Love to have the dog knowledge he has and the means and methods to spontaneously react like he does...,1314489600,,217,4.891891891891892
3974490,3,B002RJ8YDM,"We have all of his seasons shows, and love them all.  I was sorry to see that they broke this season up into two discs... kind of greedy of them, but we bought them both anyway.  I hope Cesar pressures them into not pulling that stuff again.  It will lose him loyal buyers.",1314144000,2,273,4.113207547169812
3974491,5,B002RJ8YDM,"Cesar Milan is a true Guru, his knowledge and experience is explained in his own words and actions, there is no pretence, just good solid advice most of which, if applied with care, can be accomplished by an amateur although some techniques shouldn't be tried without advice or by a professional, this is clearly stated where it is applicable and if you don't feel confident in applying these methods, again you should call in some-one who is, but I would check first that that person is sympathetic to the `Dog Whisperer' and his methods, simply because they work and they are sustainable without unnecessary apparatus or cruelty.

Cesar Milan is not going to teach you how to train your dog to sit and stay, he is dealing with dogs that, through no fault of their own, have gone beyond everyday acceptable behaviour and turned into various sized monsters with issues and phobias.  Without exception, these animals have been brought back to be useful loving pets and working dogs, and he will show you how this was achieved.

A truly miraculous transformation can be attained with kindness and hard work.
I am honestly in awe of this man and his work and the videos in these series are a real testament to his ability.  I have owned and trained Rottweilers for over 40 years

3974492,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I also own Seasons 1-4 and wondered about why there were only 3 discs in Season 5.  I guess it is reflected in the price.  The other seasons were priced higher than Season 5.  I would have rather paid more to watch more.  Either way, I watched from beginning to end - man do I have a headache.  I don't have tv so I was being a DW glutton.  Nothing new I can say about the Dog Whisperer other than I wish I had that kind of aura.  May be short on the discs but he is never short on helping the dogs.",1307318400,26,499,3.7864077669902914

3974498,5,B002RJ8YDM,"Cesar Millan is really a people-who-have-dogs whisperer, IMO!  He is so simply correct in his approach and psychology- very helpful even to those of us who agree with his oft-cited truism:  ""Dogs are NOT people!  We need to speak their language to build a strong relationship.  This is not a democracy, these are domesticated wild thangs that came from wolves.  They need a pack leader and if it's not YOU, then they will be running the show!""

3974508,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I am a big Cesar Milan fan, tried his techniques on our new dog a few years ago and have had zero issues with her, though she had the potential to be a ""bad dog"" that ended up in the shelter, in the wrong hands (huge, a Mastiff-Boxer-? mix, VERY stubborn, high energy, dominant, destructive, easily-irritated, and quick to snap as a young dog).  I didn't know any of this, I found her on the Internet and chose her because she was pretty.  Lol.  I've had big dogs all my life and this was a situation where I was starting fresh with a new dog and didn't have any other dogs to ""show them the ropes"" (rare) and wanted to brush up on my ""training"" when I came across Cesar's DVD's.  Instead of just training her (which I also did), I like to say I ""Cesar'd"" her ;)...I started from the moment my husband walked in the door with her (I didn't greet her, I sat on the floor and let her come to me) and she is my favorite dog ever.  She's now 135 pounds of beautifully behaved teddy bear, but this dog would also protect me with her life.  Everyone loves her, the vet raves over how well-behaved she is, and I know it's because of the Cesar stuff.  I watched every DVD on Netflix when she was a puppy and applied where needed.  Too bad I didn't start off with my daughter's tiny dog the same way...he's still a work in progress.",1401062400,,1323,4.1607843137254905
3974509,5,B002RJ8YDM,These sessions are so helpful.  Have watched them prior to bringing our puppy home.  Will use them for resource material as she matures.,1398643200,,136,4.869565217391305

3974511,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I am so grateful to Cesar for his DVDs. I have all five seasons now and am always learning something new or being reminded of something that I could do better. There are often at least eight dogs at my home for family gatherings and they all get along beautifully. The largest is a Bernese Mountain dog and the smallest is a 4 lb, 3-legged chihuahua. Cesar's insights and ways of presenting informations are always pertinent, important and of value to any owner or anyone who has contact with dogs.",1389916800,,498,4.544444444444444

3974513,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I have learned so much from Cesar DVD's.  He is truly gifted in understanding dogs. I used to train my dogs in 'obedience' training, but now I use Cesar's Dog Whisperer method.  It has made all the difference in the world with my dog, he not only listens, but he WANTS to do what I ask.  Every one can learn from these videos if they will only do what he suggests. I would love to see some new DVD's from Cesar available.",1389744000,,421,4.109756097560975
3974514,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I will always recommend Cesar Millan for behaviour issues or just plain understanding dogs and what dogs need.  This isn't dog training, by the way and I'm not to saying he's the only one out there that can help you, just saying to take what you can with anyone who is offering and do what works for you.  He is a very valuable resource.",1389312000,,337,4.25
3974515,5,B002RJ8YDM,"Oh, I don't want to review this, because I feel that words won't do justice.

This is kind of a review for all seasons, so I'm sorry if you are looking to see about this season only.

I learn so much from watching this show. It's especially helpful because I live in a place where there are so many dogs, many of them unbalanced and without discipline. After watching his show, I know better how to deal with those dogs even though their owners don't do anything to help. I certainly don't go disciplining other people's dogs, and don't need to. ""No touch, no talk, no eye contact,"" and minding my energy truly goes a long way.

I no longer get jumped on by hyper and/or dominant dogs, and am also better able to help fearful dogs.

Thank you, Cesar, and those people who made the show!",1385337600,,786,4.326530612244898

3974518,5,B002RJ8YDM,"Great training video! I have had a dogs all of my live and I knew about 90% of what Cesar was saying, but this guy knows dogs really really well. There are simple principles that he is using in all of his training and if you will understand and apply those principles consistently your efforts would pay of a big time.",1370563200,,318,4.229508196721311

3974524,5,B002RJ8YDM,"Cesar is my main role model in working with dogs wholly, raising a family with animals, and just who God made him to be.
That said, I love what he does to inspire his audience and clients in this chapter of DVDs. Just look at Mr. President. He is a living example of what a bull dog can and should be, well balanced.  This DVD shows that with patience and much common sense you too can make your dog the best he can be instead of a nuisance. Cesar doesn't always know what to do, but as he studies that dog, he comes up with an individual remedy that each dog really needs.  And his extended pack is inexplicably an, aide, and help as an extension of Cesar's inner being.",1362009600,,671,4.153846153846154
3974525,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I really appreciate Cesar Millan and his show. Because of Cesar I had the courage to take in a rescued American Pit Bull Terrier and I believe it is the best decision I've ever made. My Pit Bull is my best friend, my love, my life. I may not follow all of Cesar's suggestions but I do try as best I can and watching his show makes me want to be a better dog owner.",1359590400,4,364,3.8666666666666667
3974526,5,B002RJ8YDM,"I love Cesar Millan. He is truely a good person with a gift from God to reach out and help people and their dogs. At the end of each program not only has he taught the ownner how to have a balanced dog, but the owner learns how to maintain balance in their life.  I highly recommend everything ""Cesar"" to anyone with dogs,  anyone considering getting a dog and anyone with a fear of dogs. Believe me, this good, wholesome educational programming for the whole family.",1358726400,,467,4.4186046511627906
3974527,5,B002RJ8YDM,"Cesar Milan has a unique way of dealing with problem dogs, and it works.  It's harder than it ought to be to put his methods into practice, but for us with our four previously dumped dogs plus one adopted from a friend he has been a lifesaver.  People rarely dump well-behaved dogs, so by adopting four dumped dogs we were adopting four sets of problems.  The fifth one, who we adopted from a friend who could no longer care for her, has been easier to manage, but dogs times five is a handful any way you shake it.
Cesar Milan has been a lifesaver.  I heartily recommend his Dog Whisperer series of videos.",1358467200,2,607,4.345132743362832

But we're huge fans of Cesar Milan and regularly binge-watch his program just because if you really listen to what Cesar is saying, he has a lot of wisdom not only about dogs but for humans too. It's rare that I don't see an episode that Cesar doesn't impart some ""pearl"" of wisdom that doesn't make me think about how it applies to my own life. This tape is greatoffering longer footage for each case than time allows on an episode on TV. A family member commented that they got more from an hour of Cesar than two years of seeing a therapist. I believe it and I know I've heard other people on Cesar's programs make the same comment. I think Cesar is a Human Whisperer too and this cat person is a huge fan!!
