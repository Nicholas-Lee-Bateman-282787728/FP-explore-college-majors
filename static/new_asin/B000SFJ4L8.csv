2884394,5,B000SFJ4L8,This lady was a true icon.  I am so happy that her performances were preserved for us not so fortunate to see her in person.  Each replay of this disc brings a new detail previously missed.  Recommend this for all dance buffs.,1288396800,7,226,4.333333333333333
2884395,5,B000SFJ4L8,"Wonderful!  These 2 DVDs allow you to watch 3 performances and listen to commentaries on them afterwards.  These commentaries help you to understand the meanings of the movements in the dances.  There is even older footage of Appalacian Spring which is compared to the newer version which I found interesting.  I was particularly interested in Martha Graham's techniques, and there is some filming of some of those with her voice narrating and explaining them.  It is a treat to hear her speak.  For people interested in the filming aspect of the performances and others at that time period, it is neat to hear what Nathan Kroll has to say on that subject.",1231459200,11,656,4.8125
2884396,5,B000SFJ4L8,"This DVD was absolutely outstanding for me (unfamiliar with modern dance) and exceeded my wife's  expectations (very knowledgeable and familiar with modern dance). The reasons for this very positive impression were: Martha herself narrates and explains the whole DVD, the film producer also provides insights into Martha's life and personality, and original dancers performing the original productions.

Very enjoyable either as an expert or as a beginner.",1211241600,25,456,5.791044776119403

8205219,5,B000SFJ4L8,"Captured this iconic dancer and innovator.  I appreciate the variety in the choreographed works on this dvd.  As a dance instructor, I also appreciate the glimpse into classwork in the Graham style and how it follows her work from the early stages through her later years.  The biography and interviews lent even more depth of her work.",1459209600,2,336,4.859649122807017
8205220,5,B000SFJ4L8,"It was wonderful revisiting Martha thru this medium.  Having just seen the company in concert, it was wondrous to see these dances again.",1440720000,,137,4.956521739130435
8205221,5,B000SFJ4L8,"I was fortunately to attend a performance of her company the same day she received a proclamation from Frisco ; following Supervisor Kopp's declaration she took the stage and spoke briefly, yet I was memorized by her time on stage. Similarly I find her spellbinding in these black &white images whether she is philosophical or dancing. Kudos to Nathan Kroll for superb production values that have not dimmed with the passage of time.",1426291200,,433,4.945205479452055
8205222,5,B000SFJ4L8,Martha Graham was the Mother of Modern Dance and this is an amazing look at both her dancing and her choreography.  She was the lady who started the movement of modern dance and even she helped get all the other choreographers' like Twyla Tharp get their start.  This is a superb look at the ethereal Martha Graham.,1411084800,,315,4.508771929824562
8205223,5,B000SFJ4L8,"Wonderful, really wonderful.  Not only do you get three of Martha's iconic dances, you get a comparison of two versions of Appalachian Spring separated by decades.  It that wasn't enough you a tutorial on the Martha Graham technique, a documentary on how the dances were filmed and extensive interviews with former Graham dancers.  This is a keeper!

The CD arrived timely and in perfect condition.",1408147200,,398,5.076923076923077
8205224,5,B000SFJ4L8,The film includes Martha  Graham and her philosophy of dance as well as several of her signature dances with her iconic artists,1391126400,,127,4.7727272727272725
8205225,5,B000SFJ4L8,"Martha Graham was a unique dancer and choreographer whose influence on dance is undeniable.  Nathan Kroll's ""Martha Graham Dance on Film"" captures that and more.  This compilation of performances, interviews, and documentaries makes it easy for anyone - not just dancers - to find inspiration in the work of dancers and the progression of Modern Dance through the twentieth century.

The DVD is conveniently broken up into different chapters.  Some document Graham's life; others are recordings of her dances and film productions she's made with her company and film industry colleagues.  I watch my favorite chapter, ""A Dancer's World,"" all the time.  It's so enchanting - kind of like being lulled to sleep to the cadence of your favorite bedtime story.  Also, if you pay close attention, throughout the DVD you'll see appearances from other awesome dancers like Merce Cunningham, Mary Hinkson, Yuriko and Paul Taylor.

Due to Graham's contributions to dance on film, this DVD is a great find for any cinephile.  It's awesome that Nathan Kroll put this together.  You won't be sorry you bought it!",1390089600,4,1099,5.123595505617978
8205226,5,B000SFJ4L8,"Martha Graham has never appeared as sultry and in control of her craft as examined here in this wonderful documentary.  It's part instruction, part documentary, part performance, and a totally fabulous look at what it means to be a dancer in the world of dance.  You get the definite sense that dance consumed Graham's life (which it did).  You see her put her dancers through their paces explaining each choreographed move in the poetic fashion only she could articulate and realize.  There are even segments of Graham herself in performance clips from some of her seminal works.  This Criterion transfer is luscious and re-digitized in glorious black and white.  You can tell its from a time gone by but the picture quality is crisp and absolutely artifact free.  Highly recommended and a wonderful tribute to an icon of American 20th century dance.",1381017600,2,851,4.950704225352113
8205227,5,B000SFJ4L8,This is a great video for dancers and teachers. Quality is excellent and I couldn't get enough of the footage. Loved it.,1357344000,2,120,4.5
