7959702,3,B000063URU,"Far less excruciating than the NYC 25 best dunks one from this same series.  There is some pretty cool, watchable stuff here.

Unfortunately, as with the dunks video, the producers/editors are WAY too in love with the instant replay, rewind, slow motion
effects.  Far too many plays aren't even shown once in regular time, but three times in slow motion.  It's like they don't have
enough confidence in it being cool/exciting enough on it's own, so they have to do all this effects crap.  Ruins it for me.",1334361600,,505,4.693181818181818
7959703,1,B000063URU,"I don't really need to say much because the other cat who gave 1 star said it all.  I don't know who made this, but I hope they go bankrupt.  This DVD was so bad I think I could sue for false advertising.  And the other two reviewers that gave 5 stars, have either never watched basketball or work for the distributor.  And it's so funny because they'd do slow motion replays of the most average uninteresting plays.  Like of someone just passing the ball.  I keep wondering if this was some kind of joke.  Anyways don't waste your money, you'll find it more entertaining to go and watch players at your local court.",1096848000,,616,4.350877192982456
7959704,1,B000063URU,"A warning for any true recipient of streetball, this Dvd is TERRIBLE! After watching the 1st 2minutes, I wanted to turn it off, I forced myself to watch it in the hopes it got better... The player profiles & street league table structure was a good idea though I wasted no time in studying it, I merely glanced. The commentary was irritating with so called ""Streetballers!"" running off at the mouth with regards to players supposed ""Ill"" moves which were not featured. The music was dull, and the film work featured continuous ""LETS SEE THAT AGAIN!"" replays which weren't even that special. I believe the commentators watched another game, and were duped in the thought that their voices would be used for some true baller games... Your much better off buying the ""And 1: Ball Access Mixtape tour"" Dvd for pure essential streetball quality, inclusive of: Freestyle Rhyming, ill moves, pics & [mess] ups, to name a few. As a baller myself I could get better frills playing on my local court by myself...",1053820800,,1002,4.764367816091954
7959705,5,B000063URU,"Slam from the Street is the best streetball tape I have seen. It shows us some truely amazing moves, especially the dunks, from some of the biggest streetball tournaments in the US with some of the best steetball players. This is truley authentic streetball action. You really get the feel of the neighborhoods these hard core streetball tournaments are played in, as well as the texture and lifestyle of the ballers represented. The footage at West 4th Street in Manhattan is especially fantastic (The world famous Conrad McRae slam dunk contest at West 4th was really sick). I think all basketball fans will really enjoy these DVD's.",1018137600,6,635,4.94392523364486
