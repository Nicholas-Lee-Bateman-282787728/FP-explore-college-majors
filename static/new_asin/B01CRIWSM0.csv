7689066,5,B01CRIWSM0,It's a true to life story.,1468540800,4,26,3.5
7689067,1,B01CRIWSM0,An excellent film. A tabooed subject is handled with sensitivity.,1467936000,,65,5.6
7689068,5,B01CRIWSM0,"This movie is based on a true story.  First and foremost, any kind of sexual abuse on a minor is wrong and the worst violation of the Natural Law viz.
universal right and wrong.  The value of this DVD movie is the revelation such unfortunate abuse occurs in different cultures, nations around the world and no institution where humanity exists is immune.  I admire the courage of the 13 year old actor Sebastian Aguirre Boeda who portrayed the 13 year old Seminary Student Julian Santos.  For Boeda to act out the role in such a movie is real bravery.  In Perfect Obedience, here is a nave boy just entering puberty with all the physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual struggles with raging harmones.  Then he is indoctrinated into a man/boy sexual relationship over one calendar year to be ""brainwashed"" into very warped principles of so-called obedience?!  The young actor Boeda portrayed all it with a real-life performance worthy of a five-star plus rating.  The producer demonstrated how dangerous power in an authority figure can progress without any checks or balances of decency and the misleading consequences for subordinates.  Satan thrives where he is hated most and the evil one's greatest weapon is denial of his existence - it can happen in any church or faith group.  Well done!",1466726400,12,1303,4.9631336405529956
7689069,4,B01CRIWSM0,just a ok read for me,1465776000,,21,2.6666666666666665

7689071,4,B01CRIWSM0,interesting movie,1494720000,,17,8.0
7689072,5,B01CRIWSM0,"Although the subject matter of the film is difficult to deal with the film itself is excellent. From the aspects of film direction, acting, and script this movie is incredibly well done. As for dealing with the challenging subject matter of child sexual abuse within powerful systems of control (religious in this regard, but it could just as easily be a state controlled system) it gave me the feeling of watching an expert horror film about a creepy stalker and an all powerful system protects him. The most disturbing aspect of the film is that the story it portrays is all too common and all too real; let it break your heart and remind you what too many children and young adults have had to endure at the hands of the powerful.",1494115200,4,733,4.5606060606060606
7689073,1,B01CRIWSM0,"I had to stop the film less than halfway thorough. The slow, steady,and scary monologue of the priest--well, I knew what was coming next, and it bothered me. People who are smaller or more sensitive than others sometimes have an abuser in their lives. Though it may not be sexual abuse, abuse is abuse,  and it is always shattering.",1493510400,2,332,4.627118644067797
7689074,4,B01CRIWSM0,"This movie is exactly what you think it's going to be like.  I think it was done pretty well...and sadly, I think this has happened and is still happening in the name of religion.",1493078400,2,179,4.264705882352941
7689075,1,B01CRIWSM0,This film is as creepy as its subject matter. It has a repulsive religious pedophile mafia where nobody is punished or even held accountable for their sexual crimes against young men. The film is almost a guide book on how to get away with pedophilia.,1490054400,,251,4.6
7689076,5,B01CRIWSM0,"I love hearing and seeing the truth of things being well played as it was done in Perfect Obedience!
Shocking as it was at some points it never was so overwhelming to the point of aversion but the sensitive nature of these individuals being corrupted in an on-going learning cycle made my heart heavy with great sadness.
The fact it was based on actual events and is condoned by a great church who is well aware of their vices and corruption.... negated the ""higher sensitivities"" of each younger generations devotions to each other....and God Himself!",1486080000,,552,4.821052631578947
7689077,4,B01CRIWSM0,Thought the acting was great and the story very realistic,1485734400,,57,4.8
7689078,4,B01CRIWSM0,Interesting !,1484524800,,13,6.0
7689079,5,B01CRIWSM0,All religious people should be required to watch this movie (especially the catholics).  The movie was very well done although the subject matter is difficult to watch at times. Learn to question authority.,1483574400,,206,5.242424242424242
7689080,5,B01CRIWSM0,"Very good movie. Nice storyline, acting was great. Sensitive topic handled well.",1483401600,,80,5.75

7689082,1,B01CRIWSM0,all around bad movie.,1482451200,,21,4.5
7689083,3,B01CRIWSM0,"This movie needed to be re-edited and then not so afraid to explore its theme within the actual scenes themselves.  The overall impact could have been a lot stronger without the ""social"" editing.",1481846400,,195,4.909090909090909
7689084,5,B01CRIWSM0,CHILLING STORY OF EVIL WITH STRAIGHTFORWARD PRESENTATION,1481587200,,56,7.142857142857143
7689085,4,B01CRIWSM0,"The preisthood has long been the perfect hiding place for young gay catholic boys to aspire.

I don't think that today's young gay catholic boys feel the need to hide themselves in the preisthood as they once did.",1481241600,2,213,4.605263157894737
7689086,3,B01CRIWSM0,"Difficult topic, but well acted",1481241600,,31,5.4

7689088,4,B01CRIWSM0,GOOD  MOVIE,1480982400,,11,4.5
7689089,5,B01CRIWSM0,This film approaches an important topic in a way that I have not seen before. The characters are portrayed as evolving throughout the scenes and flashbacks and leave the viewer with conflicted viewpoints in the end.,1480636800,3,215,5.0
7689090,3,B01CRIWSM0,"A little too real, believable, & shocking. See where perfect  obedience will take you.",1479600000,3,86,5.142857142857143
7689091,3,B01CRIWSM0,It's missing many elements in that genre of portraying scandals of the Church.,1478390400,,78,5.076923076923077
7689092,4,B01CRIWSM0,"It was well done, but dark and sinister.  In its own way it's as unpleasant as the violence in a Quintin Tarrantino movie.  VERY unpleasant but I believe the awful truth about the Catholic Church, though I know some good people affiliated with it in one capacity or another, but ultimately the church has done much damage in the world...it's role in colonial empire building, oppression of women, it's role in colonialism, the Inquisition, homophobia and money laundering.  Yeah the awful truth. The reality of sexual abuse is that too often perpetrators were former victims and many victims become the next perpetrators.  Scary stuff. I couldn't quite hang in to the very end.",1478044800,2,677,4.964601769911504
7689093,4,B01CRIWSM0,sad but true I am sure  bastard,1477872000,,31,3.4285714285714284
7689094,3,B01CRIWSM0,"This was a very serious and intense look at a Catholic Priest that took advantage of his power and position in ""mentoring"" young men chosen to attend seminary. The priest chooses one young pupil to personally mentor in the ways of Perfect Obedience. The taboo subject of pedophilia in the priesthood was handled in an appropriately dark and manipulative manner as the young student was groomed for sexual release and then thrown aside at the end of the year for another first year student.",1477612800,7,489,4.833333333333333
7689095,2,B01CRIWSM0,this is nothing compared to the Boys of saint Vicente,1476230400,,53,4.4
7689096,2,B01CRIWSM0,"This is an abuse case FAR different from that which random youths were assaulted in North America.  Far different because the victim entered into religious training seeking to become a priest, and to find ""perfect obedience"" to Christ in his life.  Instead, the leaders of the order inserted themselves into the ""God"" position, and defiled not only their charges, but the mission of their calling. And in the end, the Catholic Church used
the same remedy so often used in other abuse cases -- simply retire/reassign guilty priests, in an attempt to save the reputation of the Mother
Church.  Wolves in Sheep clothing is correct.",1475107200,2,628,4.961904761904762
7689097,4,B01CRIWSM0,thanks.,1472515200,,7,7.0
7689098,5,B01CRIWSM0,Came right on schedule. A new title. Glad to have it. Thanks!,1470441600,,61,4.166666666666667
7689099,4,B01CRIWSM0,A haunting look at the relationship between a boy and a priest. Shows the power that the clergy can have over those under their care and the willingness of the young and naive to obey those in authority no matter how corrupt or self-serving that authority may be.,1469750400,6,263,4.5
8753988,3,B01CRIWSM0,"First the good points; the cinematography, lighting, acting, score, and art direction are well done.  The movie, released under the production name ARTSPLOITATION,  (liberty to exploit a particular subject matter) in this case, the Catholic church and priests who sexually exploit children. With all the fore mentioned qualities you can watch this movie and be satisfied.  The short coming, however, is the film's lack of in depth characterization.  The story and characters that unfold before us are one dimensional and show only what's on the surface.  It's hard to develop empathy when we can't see below the surface.  Thus the writers and director exploit a serious subject.  The director leads us on with expectations but doesn't deliver; like taking a road trip to place you've always wanted to see and then getting there and finding it's a dud. Moral of the story: enjoy the journey.",1534550400,,890,5.096551724137931

8753990,4,B01CRIWSM0,Pretty good.,1517616000,,12,5.5
8753991,1,B01CRIWSM0,Is a terrible movie I hate it. Why did you don't put this movie in Gay section. It is all a Trash movie,1517270400,,103,3.5217391304347827
8753992,2,B01CRIWSM0,"This film's portrayal of a priest who abuses his power to prey on children seems to lack any moral point of view, which is wanted because it is creepy in a way that you want to wash it out of your mind with soap.  There is no redemption, no punishment.  At times, his victim seems happy with the relationship.",1514246400,,309,4.220338983050848
8753993,2,B01CRIWSM0,"If you have been molested, sexually violated, or raped, you don't want to watch this. The movie only portrays 'what happens' & 'how you get there', it does not show the consequences of those actions nor a form of justice.

Many have stated that it's true to life & they are right.",1511568000,,280,4.384615384615385
8753994,4,B01CRIWSM0,"Makes you think, what if?",1506556800,,25,4.2
8753995,3,B01CRIWSM0,I think the performances in this were fantastic.  The direction was amazing and the cinematography for me made this movie.  My problem is that this just felt at the end like a useless 90 minutes I can't get back.  This was definitely filmed with a very close up view of these relationship that took place between the priest and these pubescent boys.  I had a yucky feeling the whole time because I was so repulsed at this one priest.  Unfortunately with the ending I had to down grade two stars it really seemed like a waste of time.  Three stars for the writing on this.,1500854400,,571,4.390476190476191
8753996,4,B01CRIWSM0,"Great acting, superb writing, but a horrible story that is even more horrible when you think it has happened so many times to so many boys who believed in the Catholic Church. Impunity is clearly the most disgusting part of all that.",1500336000,,233,4.571428571428571
8753997,3,B01CRIWSM0,Thanks for quick delivery & good item,1499558400,,37,4.428571428571429
