8193034,5,6300156400,"I watched this more often than 3 Sesame Street Stories, especially when it got damaged.  Now all I had left was this tape (until I got the other sesame street golden book video from my friend Wendy), with breathtaking adventures of Super Grover.  One of them was a parody of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, in which Prairie Dawn played the part of Goldilocks in a play that Grover had gone to see.  Thinking Prairie Dawn was in trouble, Grover transformed to Super Grover and got rid of the ""bears"" he thought Prairie was frightened of.  But Prairie kept telling Grover that those weren't really bears; they were Ernie, Bert, and Herry, so Grover ended up ""taking them to the zoo.""  Then Prairie got angry at Grover because he was really kidnapping some of her friends; not sending wild animals back to where they belong.  Prairie Dawn took off her curly wig and decided that she would retire being a star.
In ""Big Bird Brings Spring To Sesame Street,"" Big Bird buys six different flowers of different colors.  One part was when Ernie said that Betty Lou had been sick with the flu, so Ernie was going to give the yellow daffodil to her.  And because Big Bird's purple iris had been somewhat bend he gave it to Oscar.  Also, Big Bird gave his rose to Bert to cheer him up about his lost paper clip.  When Big Bird had given all his flowers away, he realized he had ""brought spring to Sesame Street.""",1009238400,5,1399,4.47244094488189
