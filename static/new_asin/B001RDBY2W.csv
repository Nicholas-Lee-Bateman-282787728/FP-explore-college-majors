3774680,5,B001RDBY2W,Learning the piano very fast with this CD.  Most reviews are inaccurate but this one is for real.,1281139200,7,97,4.388888888888889
3774681,5,B001RDBY2W,"Rev. Collins may be relatively unknown to many, but he is perhaps the best piano teacher in North America. Having studied music theory from a variety of sources and encountered many music teachers over the decades, I was really fortunate to order this DVD sight unseen. I was hoping it would be a decent instructional tool but instead it turned out to be the best I've ever seen, and at this price it is worth its weight in gold. If you are serious about learning to play piano and are happy to learn without having to know how to read music or interpret various musical charts and other complicated and potentially confusing ideas and concepts, this is the only DVD you need. Rev. Collins makes it so simple that it could not possibly be any simpler, but he teaches enough piano to take someone from a less-than-beginner stage to the stage of being a fluent professional player. I wish every teacher had a fraction of his teaching talent.",1251849600,21,939,4.595238095238095
8337727,5,B001RDBY2W,"Wonderful teaching DVD.  Packaging is very minimal and CD style case; you may want to store it in a more protective and larger case or box. The DVD is detailed with its material for learning the piano.  It will take time to go through the entire DVD and fully grasp all the information. You need to be physically at the piano/keyboard while viewing the DVD so you can practice the applicable keys and put the DVD on hold/pause, until you master what's being taught.",1484265600,,465,4.523809523809524
8337728,5,B001RDBY2W,"I found the cd to be too basic.  The instruction of 1/2 hour is too limited.  What is there is clear and understandable, the seller quickly accepted a return and did not make me mail it back to get it.  For this I gave him all five stars.  The cd was not what I wanted but may fit some buyer's needs well.",1440201600,,305,3.870967741935484
8337729,5,B001RDBY2W,"Basically this is for the VERY beginner, although I am able to learn from the last to chapters on chords and scales.",1439424000,,116,4.318181818181818

8337731,5,B001RDBY2W,"Very helpful, excellent  clear and to the point",1419984000,2,47,4.875
8337732,5,B001RDBY2W,"This book is very good, for me, personally I bought this book without any background in piano or keyboard experience and within a few weeks I could play the tunes in the books and tunes in other piano music collection books. It's a good idea for someone who just wants to learn piano for themselves and either hasn't got the time or the money for lessons",1398124800,2,354,4.378787878787879
8337733,5,B001RDBY2W,"This is a good CD for beginners who want to learn basic scales and chords(major and minor) on the piano.  It will not teach you how to play the piano as it assumes you already have that knowledge and just want information on how to play and remember basic scales and chords.  So, this CD would not be helpful for those who want to learn how to read music or play a tune on the piano. Really, I thought this CD would go into greater details about scales and chords, so it didnt' suit my purposes, but I love the presenter and his easy-going style and will use it with my neice when she starts learning how to play the piano.",1356048000,6,623,4.140495867768595
8337734,5,B001RDBY2W,"My 10 yr old son has learned how to play piano very easily by watching this video.  I have him go over it every weekend and he is now able to play 8 pieces on his own now, by sound.",1354752000,7,181,3.525
8337735,5,B001RDBY2W,"I purchased this DVD because I had become so frustrated with the way I was being taught in my beginning college course.  Doug Collins, the instructor for this DVD, sure knows how to explain things in a way that makes it easy for me to understand.  There is no fluff, just straight to the point.  He urges you to repeat a lesson until you have it down completely before moving on to the next step, which is really helpful.  I am a singer and vocal instructor, so learning the piano for me is a must.  I am so thankful for this DVD, I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn how to play the piano.  Doug Collins is an amazing teacher and provided wonderful customer service.  You will not regret this purchase!",1352937600,6,717,4.3059701492537314
