8491240,4,B0062NAWX4,"This great blue ray gives us the opportunity to watch these three incredibly beautiful and magnificent places. I have been fortunate enough to visit Grand Canyon and I'm awfully happy to see it again in amazing HD. And I'd be thrilled if I could visit Yellowstone and Yosemite, even more after getting to know them better in this blue ray.",1355875200,,339,4.666666666666667
8491241,3,B0062NAWX4,"We are blessed with having visited the 3 featured National Parks and wanted this DVD as a pleasant reminder of those memorable occasions to supplement our personal photos. The programs are good, brief, being about 35 to 40 minutes for each feature, and the photography is of high quality. The narrative is enjoyable and we are satisfied with the purchase. The package contains a blu-ray disc and a another disc which contains a standard DVD version as well as a digital copy for a computer and/or mobile downlaod.",1342569600,7,513,4.840909090909091
8491242,5,B0062NAWX4,"America's National Park Collection -- Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon
This is an excellent DVD--Photography and narration.  The three sections leave you wishing for more.  I'd say this is one of the best of the National Park videos.",1335052800,3,236,5.351351351351352
8491243,3,B0062NAWX4,"The video of the national parks is very nice, giving a sense of the magnificence of these parks.  It doesn't quite jump off the screen like some of the Blu-Rays of other national parks, so if you have a Blu-Ray player, it might be worth it to get the Blu-Ray version over this DVD disc for improved visuals.

The audio is very mediocre, though, worth maybe 2 stars on its own.  The background music is merely okay, and the narrator is just plain bad.  The video is mostly matter-of-fact history, plus a bit of over-the-top hyperbole.  The script sounds like a middle-schooler wrote it, with far too many phrases saying this park is ""the most amazing {X} on earth"", without any variation of word choice or creativity.  You will get some useful factoids about the history of these parks and a few tips on visiting, but beyond that, you're better off playing this with the sound muted.  Unlike other DVDs in this genre, there's no option to play the disc with ambient music instead of the commentary track.

It's watchable, and perhaps even enjoyable.  It had the potential to be awe-inspiring -- but the poor narration & music make it fall well short of that.",1334188800,,1157,4.6048780487804875
8491244,4,B0062NAWX4,"The grandiose statement: what is America? with sweeping vistas introduces each of the 3 parks shown in this DVD: Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon. A cursory history of the park's geography and human history is given, but for each the show is more of a 1950's travelogue  on what can be seen and done at each park, including touching on the historic hotels that are in each one.

There are bonus features showing the parks' snow coach rides (7 minutes), rafting (7 minutes) and the giant trees (4 minutes).
Yellowstone (34 minutes) consists of; scenic Yellowstone, wildlife spectacle, wolves of Yellowstone, winter in Yellowstone.
Grand Canyon (27 minutes) has; natural stone landmarks, rafting the Colorado, the Grand Railroad
Yosemite (28 minutes) contains; landmarks, a storied past, John Muir, visiting Yosemite.
There are no closed captions.

The photography is beautiful, the narration is done well and it will make you long to travel to these 3 national treasures.",1332979200,11,980,5.189873417721519
8491245,5,B0062NAWX4,"This DVD is probably the best DVD I have seen on the big three national parks (Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Grand Canyon).  The content/footage is stunning, and I could tell that the angles chosen for many of the shots were carefully thought out and orchestrated. The filmmaker, Dennis Burkhart, truly has the magic eye, and anyone who appreciates our national parks like I do will, with 100% certainty, enjoy this.  I also enjoyed many of the historical points I gleaned from watching this DVD, as well.  I will simply end this with- WOW.",1331856000,,537,4.815217391304348
