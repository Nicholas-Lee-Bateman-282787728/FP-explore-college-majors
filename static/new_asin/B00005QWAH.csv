1651399,2,B00005QWAH,"O.K. I hate Freddie Prinze Jr.'s movies.  My girlfriend like most 13-21 old females loves them.  So since we alway watch the stupid comedies that I'm into I decided to please her for the night and give this one a try.  Stupid writing-as expected.  Freddie Prinze Jr. doing something for all the girls that paid $9.00 to see this one when it was out-as expected(running around in a thong)  It had a very pretty girl to co-star with him-as expected(Jessica Biel was her name and being the first time I've seen her I feel in love with her, geourgeus girl)  It was a bad movie-as expected but not horrible-complete surprise.  I thought I was going to completly detest this film which I did not.  Like I said it wasn't good but it wasn't unwatchable.  I guess if you don't have anything better to do it won't be a waste of time.  After telling my girlfriend how I felt she immediately took advantage of the situation and conviced me into renting another Freddie Prinze Jr. movie, this time ""She's all that""  Hopefully it would be like this one or even better(yeah right like Freddie Prinze Jr. can actually pick a good script)  Freddie Prinze Jr. fan you will love this film otherwise rent it first and see what you think.  My opinion rentable yes, owning it well not quite.",1010361600,,1269,4.5131578947368425
1651400,5,B00005QWAH,"Summer Catch is the story of Ryan Dunne (Freddie Prince Jr.) trying to make it in his Cape Cod baseball league. It has humorous incidents with Boxer stealers and little mascots. It shows the courage people can have and the willingness to help their team. Also, it has a very great part with Freddie Prince Jr. in a thong. If you like Freddie, be sure to see this movie.",1009670400,,369,4.36231884057971
1651401,2,B00005QWAH,"This movie is not good by any stretch of the imagination.  Some of the lines, including, ""You mow her lawn and you want to mow her lawn?"" and ""If I cut my left arm off do you think they'd let me be in the Special Olympics"" are just terrible.  The baseball action is far from realistic, with players diving over fences to save homeruns, and two guys on the same team batting in the low .400's in July.
What this movie does do well is bring exposure to the famed Cape Cod Baseball League, a veritable breeding ground for big leaguers including Frank Thomas, Barry Zito, Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell, Nomar, and many more.  Now every game is not the drunken fiesta as portrayed in the movie, but a more subdued atmosphere with knowledgeable baseball fans and the nation's best players.  Many of the dilemmas facing the players in the movie are real life issues facing America's up and coming crop of minor leaguers.
Regardless you should ""Catch"" this movie at some point, if simply to educate yourself on the league (and the authentic uniforms used in the movie).  Even better yet, come watch a Cape League came.  Before you come though please learn to drive first, especially around rotaries, because that is a very blatant issue facing Chatham's tourists.",1009497600,2,1252,4.668181818181818
1651402,2,B00005QWAH,"Is it me or does Freddie Prinze Jrs movies keep getting worse and worse. Fortunately Freddie saves all of these movies with his irresistable charm and likeablitity and only Freddie Prinze Jr fans will enjoy this movie. Summer Catch has to be his worse, and I have to say he is the only good thing about this poorly written, badly acted film. Jessica Biel lacks the energy needed and has no chemistry with Freddie at all. Matthew Lillard is rediculous, as he always is in films, as the loudmouth goofball of the team. Other cast members try hard but can't overcompensate for the weak script. Summer Catch has it's moments but nothing to great. Freddie Prinze is very charming and not a bad actor, he just needs to find the right film that can really show off his talent. Summer Catch is not it.",1007596800,,793,4.513888888888889

1651453,4,B00005QWAH,"Summer Catch is another group of teens go to university or make a sporting team important for being seen by talent scouts to the professional league (in this case a baseball team) who aren't that concerned with trying to make it career wise as they are with drinking and getting laid genre movie. This one also throws in the old economically struggling bad boy type who falls for the rich good girl with a promising future laid out by her dad that definitely doesn't include the bad boy.  It's very formulaic and predictable, but what makes 2001's Summer Catch a bit more interesting viewing is the sheer volume of actors in minor roles who would either already be a season or two into or later go on to become stars of TV shows that became really popular and part of popular culture.  Such as Wilmer Valderrama (Fez -That 70's Show), who is targeted by an aggressive cougar in Beverly D'angelo who he has been assigned to live with.  Gabriel Mann (Nolan Ross - Revenge), John C. McGinley (Dr Cox - Scrubs) are just a couple of the actors who went onto a lot bigger careers as opposed to the two stars on the DVD cover Freddie Prince Jr and Jessica Biel (of 7th Heaven before and after this movie), who although are still in movies and TV shows, they aren't ones that have had a lot of success.

The story itself could have been better, as I said you're not surprised by anything that happens but sometimes that's all your looking for to pass the time.",1483488000,,1452,4.447368421052632

1651502,4,B00005QWAH,"I watched Summer Catch yesterday and, must say, I enjoyed this movie. I think the message is just to follow your heart, accept the support of others, while at the same time, do not let others negatively influence you.

The main character in the movie is Ryan Dunne (well played by Freddie Prinze Jr.), an aspiring professional baseball pitcher who is playing for a Cape League team during the summer, namely the Chatham Athletics. After previous career disappointments consisting of quitting his college team and being kicked off another team, this is his last chance to make the roster of an MLB team. While playing for the A's, he also works for his father's landscaping company and falls in love with the daughter of a wealthy client, Tenley Parrish (played by the beautiful Jessica Biel).

While this is going on, he is getting both encouraged by his friends, teammates, coach to succeed on the baseball field while being discouraged by setbacks during two games as well as by constant taunting from a very strong rival pitcher on the team. In addition, Tenley's domineering father is trying to push her to pursue his career of choice although she longs for another career and does his best to destroy the relationship between Ryan and Tenley, including threatening to cut of Ryan's father's business if he doesn't stay away from Tenley. In addition, Ryan's father tries to convince him that a relationship between a rich girl and someone from his background is not possible.

Overall, a good movie. There are other good characters in the movie such as Ryan's teammates who bring humor into the movie such as Billy Brubaker (played by Matthew Lillard) and Domo (played by Wilmer Valderrama). This move is worth a watch.",1453075200,2,1723,4.873720136518771
1651503,4,B00005QWAH,"Released in 2001, Summer Catch stars Freddie Prince Jr. and Jessica Biel, the former a Cape Cod baseball prospect with hopes for the Major League who lands a gig playing for the Chatham Athletics, the latter a rich girl pressured by her pompous axx father (Bruce Davison) to move to San Francisco and work for a firm. Brian Dennehy plays the no-nonsense coach while Matthew Lillard, Brittany Murphy, Corey Pearson and Wilmer Valderrama play various youths.  Fred Ward and Jason Gedrick are on hand as the baseball hopefuls father and brother.

This is essentially a baseball version of 1999s excellent Varsity Blues and 1993s solid The Program. Its not as good as the former, but its at least as good as the latter. Everything clicks for a quality coming-of-age flick  the cast, story, acting, locations, cinematography, music and editing. The babe factor is strong with Biel leading the way with her stunning bod (actually, blowing all others out of the water); and Beverly D'Angelo still sizzles at 49 years-old in a small role. Im at a loss as to why Summer Catch rates only 4.9/10 on IMDb when its at least a 7/10 film.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Cape Cod, Cincinnati and Southport, North Carolina.

1651539,5,B00005QWAH,"Before any of you rant and rave at me for giving this five stars, all I have to say is Jessica Biel. This was the first movie I saw her onscreen and she just blew me away. I bought her falling for Freddie Prinze, Jr., so really what else did I need?

Having said that, I enjoyed the premise a ton and this despite my being a huge sports fan but not much of a sports movie one. The Cape Cod League is one of baseball's best minor leagues and I felt the movie totally captured the feel of that summer league. Loved them using Curt Gowdy as the Chatham A's radio announcer and there's even a Hank Aaron cameo that was a total out-of-the-blue surprise.

The supporting cast is solid from Brittany Murphy to Fred Ward. Now looking back you can see Matthew Lillard, Marc Blucas and Wilmer Valderrama (pre-Fez!) as well as Annie Potts made appearances. The girl who plays Jessica Biel's sister steals the entire movie with her attempts to become the mascot of the A's. Just wait till she finally nails the perfect mascot persona near the end of the flick.",1440806400,3,1048,4.369230769230769

1651571,5,B00005QWAH,"Adorable!!!!  This movie is just purely adorable.  Freddie Prince is excellent and his role as a minor league pitcher in the Cape Cod summer league is played extremely well, as the sometimes hot-headed, kid with tremendous potential, if he can keep his temper under control.  It's a wonderful Cinderella story in reverse.  Jessica Biel is at her most gorgeous and charming self, as the rich daughter who pursues the Cinderella-esque Prince, who works for his dad as a lawn boy, cutting grass and not seeing how his life as a servant to the rich is ever going to change.  Everyone believes in him, including Jessica Biel, but unless he can find how to get past his own internal low self esteem will he ever be able to pitch the game of his life, land the major league contract and be able to allow himself enjoy the most wonderful, gorgeous in the world, who adores him?

The other thing about this movie that is truly delightful is the other players and repartee between them as the young minor leaguers spend the summer partying off the field and trying to turn pro on the field.  Since buying this movie I have probably watched it six times.  It's just fun and a great shot in the arm at the end of a long work week.",1416960000,,1218,4.454954954954955

1651640,3,B00005QWAH,"I'm sure we all remember the late 90's when Freddie Prince Jr. was on everyone's tongues (not literally) and he was, to some, considered the `it' boy of the moment.  He was everywhere and he starred in everything, kind of like Jude Law was in the early 00's, except Prince Jr. was no where near as gifted.

This brings me to `Summer Catch', one of the countless teen romantic comedies that Prince Jr. starred in during his career heyday (where is his episode of `Where Are They Now?').  To be totally honest, this is one of the few that I liked.  I'll be honest, I liked this for reason that step outside of the bounds of `Freddie Prince Jr.', and two of those reasons are displayed on Jessica Biel's chest, but that aside, the film is fun and flirty and entertaining to say the least.  I'm not a baseball fan (I'm not really a fan of any sport) but the films baseball theme is lost inside it's desperation to be relevant to teenage hormones, and so the backdrop is really nothing more than that; a side point that is deemed irrelevant next to the crude humor and sexual innuendo.

Prince Jr. plays an aspiring pitcher who is riddled with talent and hesitation thanks to personal issues.  A relationship with a beautiful rich girl throws yet another wrench in his already severed relationships.

There are more than a few wrenches in this films plot though, or at least the script which fails to do the plot (which is clich&eacute;d and contrived on its own) any justice.  When you take a step back and think about what this film is `about' it becomes clear that Hollywood lacks much imagination since nearly every Freddie Prince Jr. movie kind of has the same plot.  Alas, the scenes here become uneven beings that a lot of them don't seem to have any bearing on the plots progression.  They just seem out of place.

Thanks to the supporting players, who all pull their weight, the film is entertaining and enjoyable.  While Freddie Prince Jr. has a tendency to be rather dull and boring, the same cannot be said for that `other' 90's goofball Matthew Lillard (again, where is he now?) who makes the most of his nonsensical scenes.  Jessica Biel is the main reason to see this movie.  I'm so glad that she is still relevant, even if she has yet to capitalize on her sheer talent (the girl can act, she just needs to pick better projects).  In the end, go ahead and watch this one, when it comes on cable that is.  It isn't really worth seeking out, but if the day is rainy and the mood is light, this may bring some afternoon delight.

1651642,3,B00005QWAH,"Satisfaction is about setting the proper expectations. This movie is a great example.

Without providing too much of the plot, this movie is not a baseball movie. In fact, baseball is nothing more than a sideshow for the trite love and social class struggle of a pitcher looking to achieve some level of success in life.

The scenes are set (on location) on Cape Cod and according to the infamous Cape Cod Baseball (amateur) League, a institution that boasts production of many future major leaguers. While the baseball scenes stick to the CC League traditions and many of the actual towns/teams, it is really just used as a premise or vehicle to set the format for the class struggle of a local pitcher (Freddie Prinze Jr)/college drop-out/landscaper to battle against the odds of winning the love of the rich hottie (Jessica Biel), beyond the dwindling confines of her summer vacation. Add in the usual formula of the rich and domineering father of Biel, the poor and dissatisfied-in-life father of Prinze, and the struggle for Prinze to make something successful of himself (despite the odds), and you have this movie in a nutshell.

What's wrong with this, assuming you are not put off by the usual formulas in movies? Well, Biel's 'acting' is atrocious, but she is just one of many awful performances. Beyond that, the movie just rushes through the character development and scenes on way too rapid a pace. It really needed an additional half hour. That and the baseball is just too nonsensical and contrived, in it's situations and performance, to be any value to a bb enthusiast.

1651644,2,B00005QWAH,"Remember when you watched Bull Durham, had that odd feeling, and asked yourself, ""Is this a chick flick in disguise?""  Well, look no further, because Summer Catch takes that concept, disposes of the authentic baseball all together, elevates the level of sap from ""argh"" to ""groan"", and follows a cheesy teen-comedy to the predictable end.

Ryan Dunne (Prinze), a college drop out with impeccable grooming, makes his way to his hometown Cape Code League, a place where college stars play summer baseball, and he mows adjacent lawns for his dad's landscaping business.  In roughly one encounter - in which he's embarrassed - he finds true, star-crossed love with Tenley Parrish (Biel), the incredible-looking, rich, smart, funny, nice girl who doesn't exist in real life, and whose daddy doesn't approve.  Immediately you're left thinking, will Freddie mow the lawn, or will he ""mow the lawn""?

What truly ruined this for me - other than the fact that it was disingenuously billed as a sports movie - is the unbelievable collection of sports realism.  How unathletic is Prinze if he isn't even shown playing baseball?  He's never shown in a full baseball action scene, and it looks like the director wanted to hide his limp-wristed throwing style.  Even that gawd awful throwing motion of Tim Robbins was included in Bull Durham...how horrible must Freddie have looked?  And that isn't even exploring the concept of a 6'3"", 120-lb. catcher in Matthew Lillard.  With one of the least athletic body frames in history (unless the movie is about distance running) Lillard is cast as a catcher, which just happens to be the most demanding position in baseball.  Despite providing the only real laughs of the movie, he should stick to the computer hacker genre, or another Scooby Doo sequel with his BFF Prinze.

The supporting cast fills out nicely.  Fred Ward as the dad who expects failure from Prinze (because he's seen Prinze throw), Brian Dennehy as an incompetent coach, John McGinley and Beverly D'Angelo in unimportant roles, Jason Gedrick unleashing a horrible Boston accent while trying to mimic Ben Affleck's role from Good Will Hunting (which should tell you quite a bit about Gedrick's performance and tone), and Wilmer Valderrama taking Fez from TV to the big screen by playing Fez, but with a different name and the same sexual insecurities.

It's all been done before, and better.  The only bright spot is the comedy factor, with several good laughs mostly coming from Lillard.  In the end, I was hoping for an ending that left Prinze's character (and Prinze) with a torn rotator cuff, Biel two months pregnant from a one-night stand with the ex-con concessions guy who sells those delicious pretzels, and every character in the movie searching for their next career choice (hint: it involves fries).

1651665,3,B00005QWAH,"Ryan Dunne (Freddie Prinze Jr.) has the chance of a lifetime.  This summer, he's part of the prestigious Nantucket baseball league, the league that the pro scouts use to find new talent.  Considering his tendency to crash and burn, he needs to cut all distractions out of his life.

But a beautiful distraction comes in the form of Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel).  Ryan and his father take care of the Parrish family yard work.  The two are definitely from different classes, but they connect right away.  Will they overcome their differences?  Can Ryan realize his dream of playing professional baseball?

I went into this movie expecting a romantic comedy and was surprised at just how much of a part baseball played in the story.  Still, those scenes never bothered this non-sports person.

What was weak was the writing.  The story is one cliche after another, not all of them believable.  And that definitely holds true for the climax.  Some of the characters made rather abrupt about faces with little to no explanation.

But the characters pulled me into the story.  I couldn't help but root for them to find their happy ending.  Heck, I even came to enjoy Matthew Lillard's Billy, and actor I often find hard to swallow.  The actors really did save the movie for me.

If you are willing to let yourself get swept up in the story, you'll enjoy it.  But you aren't missing anything if you skip it, either.",1234396800,,1410,4.704918032786885
1651666,3,B00005QWAH,"This is the story of Ryan Dunne (Freddy Prinze Jr.) and Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), and their summer together in Massachusetts.  Dunne is a poor, moody baseball player playing in the local Cape Cod League, while Parrish is the daughter of wealthy parents.  Despite the odds, they fall in love (surprise, surprise).  It has the potential to be the greatest baseball movie since the Rookie, but that possibility fades away after the first twenty minutes.  Despite being labeled a baseball movie, the baseball element takes a definitive back seat to the developing romance between Parrish and Dunne.  This can be disappointing if you are expecting something similar to For Love of the Game, for example.

There are several funny subplots-namely Parrish's younger sister's search for the proper mascot and Miles Dalrymple's (Marc Blucas) love for large women- but in general the storyline drags.  The dialogue is frequently corny or over-the-top, as are most of the scenes involving Prinze and Parrish together.  The main lesson of the movie is that it is important to believe in yourself, but I feel like the lesson comes too late for both characters. Prinze's performance in this film is okay, but I feel someone better could have been cast for Biel's role. The supporting cast was fantastic.

Overall, I would recommend this film. For the most part, I enjoyed it.  The few funny parts were funny enough to save the rest of the movie (in my opinion, anyway).  This is a good movie, as long as you know that you're paying for a romantic comedy.  As a romantic comedy, I would consider it a success.

1651672,3,B00005QWAH,"""Summer Catch"" is a baseball movie.  Local boy Ryan Dunne (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) has made the Chatham A's in the Cape Cod Summer League where he pitches for Coach John Schiffner (Brian Dennehy).  This is Ryan's last chance, having ruined two earlier ones, but he has a fear of failure and has been affected by the recent death of his mother.  But ""Summer Catch"" is also a romance movie, where Ryan is smitten by Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel).  He sees her getting out of a pool while he is cutting her father's lawn and if you did not get the message that Biel is no longer playing Mary Camden on ""7th Heaven,"" this moment will help persuade you.  Of course, he is from the wrong side of the tracks as far as her father is concerned.  Sound familiar yet?

It is interesting that Ryan has a major self-confidence problem because he has no problems running around in a thong belonging to Dede Mulligan (Brittany Murphy).  But there have to be obstacles to his pitching success, just as there are obstacles to his romance with Tenley, and we will all pretend to be surprised when the two of them are tied up at the end in one of the most anticlimactic endings I have ever seen in a baseball movie (although I will admit the tag scene was a nice touch).  It is just that we have seen this bit about the rich girl and the poor boy so many times, and the film does not take into account the boy wants to be a major league baseball player.  I can just see Tenley's dad (Bruce Davison) being introduced to Alex Rodriguez and saying, ""What does your father do, son?""  (Answer: ""Dad ran a shoe store in Manhattan and was a catch for a professional team in the Dominican Republic.  How come you make so much less money than I do?"").

If the romantic aspect is old hat, the baseball aspects of the film are not even up to minor league standards.  Ryan wants to be intimidating as a pitcher, but his brother Mike (Jason Gedrick) suggests that being rich is better.  Apparently we get to the final big game of the season and Coach Schiffner never suggested to his young pitcher that where you place the ball can be more important than how fast your throw it.  Meanwhile, the team has a star pitcher Corey Pearson who has no concept of being a team player and nobody wants to set this boy straight either.  The script by Kevin Falls (""Sports Night"") and John Gatins (""Hardball""), based on a story by Falls, should be stronger on the sports aspects given their other writing projects, but that is not the case.

The big question is supposedly whether Dunne can keep it together for an entire ballgame.  WHY?  The percentage of major league pitchers who throw complete games each year has been dwindling steadily for decades.  On top of that, Chatham supposedly has the best relief pitcher in the league (Ryan knows it even if his manager does not).  So when he blows a game in the 9th early in the movie, anybody who knows anything about baseball has to be wondering why he is still in there.  The baseball scenes are really hit or miss (e.g., if an outfielder picks up a ball at the fence and the running has rounded third, there is not going to be a close play at the plate).  Just explain to me why Hank Aaron, who could probably be in any baseball movie being made, chose to be in this one (Okay, I know why: because director Michael Tollin did the 1995 documentary ""Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream"").  But then why would they want a plot twist at the end that compels Curt Gowdy to say this is the damnedest thing he has ever seen in fifty years of broadcasting, because that is not necessarily a good thing.

The supporting cast is pretty good, with Matthew Lillard as catcher Billy Brubaker and Fred Ward as Ryan's father, along with Marc Blucas, Wilmer Valderrama, and Christian Kane as other players on the team.  Every one in a while they toss some comedy moments in because they are required in a baseball movie, plus the writers did research on the mythology of the Cape Cod League, but they do not always seem to fit, such as the quest of Tenley's little sister, Katie (Zena Grey), to come up with the ideal mascot for the team (but at least that one has a cute payoff).  Besides, the biggest sin in this film is wasting Beverly D'Angelo in an uncredited role as a cross between Annie from ""Bull Durham"" and Mrs. Robinson from ""The Graduate,"" and that is saying something given that Dennehy is almost totally wasted in this film.  There is also a nice cameo by Carlton Fisk that got cut that you can check out in the deleted scenes.

1651734,3,B00005QWAH,"...In the theatres, that is. But I'm not sure if anyone even knew this movie existed because the commercials just featured quick clips with barely any real dialogue. When the movie went to cable, there were most likely two types of people who watched it: teenage girls, because the movie featured heart-throbs (they're all there: Freddie Prinze, Jr., Christian Kane, Matthew Lillard); and ANY-age guys, because the commercial showed Jessica Biel in a bikini (by the way, that scene's not even in the movie).
Basically the movie is about a rich girl named Tenley Parrish (Biel) who ends up falling in love with a ""poor"" boy named Ryan Dunne (Prinze), who has ambitions to become a professional baseball pitcher. His life seems to be jaded due to his dull older brother Mike (Jason Gedrick), his father (Fred Ward), who seems to be pleased with failure, and the memories of his dead mother, who apparently was the only other person in the family that was normal. Tenley is afraid to tell her father about going after a boy who isn't rich, and that makes Ryan feel rather insecure and cheated.
The storyline isn't all that bad, but there were some things that needed heavy-duty work. Several of the characters seemed just plain useless. Ryan's sometimes-crazy best friend Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard) is featured in several scenes that don't seem to have a point, and it feels like the scenes are there only because Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard are real-life best friends, and there are few movies they don't do together nowadays. Also, the scenes with Mickey Dominguez (Wilmer Valderrama) seem like they're there just to get him in the movie. His scenes basically revolve around him being a virgin and getting close to actually losing his virginity but chickening out (doesn't that remind you of another, more POPULAR character Valderrama plays?), and it is a very big diversion from the focus of the movie, if you can even tell what that is any more. If you actually see a scene with Prinze or Biel in it, it'll be about ten to fifteen minutes before you see another one.
Another problem is something that Freddie Prinze, Jr. does in many of his movies. Just when you start to wonder why the movie is rated PG-13, Prinze starts yelling the F word. The problem with that is that he doesn't make it sound believable. Instead, it sounds more like a sixth-grader who says it just to get attention.
This movie would have been better if the plot was more focused. Also, someone should tell the director (and the writer) that the supporting cast should be there because they're actually supporting the main cast and not just because they want paychecks.",1029456000,4,2660,4.7973856209150325

1651740,3,B00005QWAH,"A pinch of baseball.  Three heaping tablespoons of a predictable teenage love story.  One half teaspoon of For Love of the Game.  Two teen heartthrobs.  Shake well.  Serve.
 So goes the recipe for Summer Catch, Hollywood's latest love story disguised as a baseball movie, starring Freddie Prinze, Jr., Jessica Biel, Jason Gedrick, and Matthew Lillard.  Drawing straight from the scripts of past baseball flicks, the love interest of a certain baseball player takes the foreground, while his ultimate success as a player coincides with his eventual realization of true love.
 Summer Catch, directed by Michael Tollin, spans a summer in the Cape Cod League, an amateur league for top college baseball players, and follows the on and off-field tribulations of left-handed pitcher Ryan Dunne (Prinze), a local boy with a troubled past.  When Dunne meets Tenley Parrish (Biel), a rich girl in town for the summer, a relationship slowly takes shape.  But as problems with his temper and focus give him problems between the lines, his social status gives him trouble off the field, and the question becomes whether or not Dunne will be able to salvage either part of his life.
 While Summer Catch was an entertaining way to spend a couple hours, it has its share of problems.  As is common to nearly all baseball movies, hitters were swinging wildly at mediocre fastballs and hanging breaking balls, and diving catches in the field were commonplace.  Casting was questionable at times as well; Billy Brubake (Lillard) is far too tall and skinny to make a believable catcher, and Prinze struggles in the role of ""boy with troubled past.""  His flashes of temper were always short lived, and came across as more spoiled whining than bitter anger.  Such scenes usually seemed to come out of nowhere, as he spent most of the movie playing his typical wide-eyed mama's boy character.  John C. McGinley turns in a strong performance as a clean-cut scout for the Phillies, however, and is joined in one scene by former major league slugger Hank Aaron, who plays himself in a brief cameo.  Lillard provides easy-going comic relief in his role as well, helping to give the team a realistic feel.
 Prinze and Biel also lack a basic chemistry, making many of their scenes together seem forced and unnatural.  The relationship is made even harder to swallow as Tenley Parrish originally comes across as relentlessly interested in Dunne, despite their first meeting consisting of Dunne being publicly humiliated.  Subsequent dates depict Dunne as largely indifferent toward Parrish, until, on one rainy night, they abruptly fall in love.
 Summer Catch does do a few things right.  The players' mechanics are generally sound, and the film manages to capture at least a hint of the basic camaraderie, vulgarity, and sexual depravity of a typical baseball locker room.  And the opening scene, in which Dunne arrives late to the team's first meeting wearing only a woman's thong, makes for an amusing start.
 And amusing is truly what Summer Catch is, and even what it is going for.  It is not going to win any awards, but that is clearly not the intention of this easy-going flick.  It should not even go down as one of the better baseball movies of our time, but nobody really expected it to be on a level with Field of Dreams or Bull Durham.  But if you are a baseball fan or a romantic with low expectations, a thick slice of Summer Catch will make for a pleasant dessert on a slow evening.",1016582400,2,3469,4.855442176870748

1651742,1,B00005QWAH,"Where do I start. Let me first try to figure out what this movie was even about. I hated this movie. The acting was horrible, the story was predictible and it was not funny at all. I was looking more forward to it returning it to the movie store then to find out how things would work out in the end. Who told Jessica Biel (or whatever her name is) that she could act? Maybe I'm wrong about her. This is the first movie I've seen her in. But I'm not so sure I would give her a second chance. Most of the actors were annoying and not funny at all. Not even the one-liners! Baseball fans don't count on this to be a good movie. It's not. Don't waste your time. So don't count on this to be a humorous movie. I will not see this movie again. I'd rather watch ""Roots"" straight through then this horrible movie again.",1013299200,3,812,4.08125
1651743,3,B00005QWAH,"""Summer Catch"" gets points for trying hard, but it is saddled with so many liabilities that it crashes and burns without getting much altitude.  The script is a mish mash of tired themes.  Small town boy makes good meets boy from the wrong side of the tracks meets baseball underdog gets big break.  The film tries to bill itself as another ""Bull Durham"" but it has none of the subtlety, comedy or insider perspective of that film.  Mostly this is just another lightweight Freddie Prinze, Jr. romantic comedy where Jessica Biel is the catch of the day.
Prinze plays his standard romantic hero role and tries to throw in some baseball.  He is fair at both but keeps getting outshined by his supporting cast.  I've never really understood the big sensation over Jessica Biel.  She shows in this film that her acting is far inferior to her looks.  Biel and Prinze interact like marble statues, nice to look at but no chemistry whatever.
The best performances were given by supporting cast members.  Fred Ward does a terrific job as Ryan's dad.  Brian Dennehy is always fabulous in supporting roles and does not disappoint as the coach of the A's.  Brittany Murphy does a fantastic wild thing, with a provocative earthiness that is simultaneously seductive and cute.
There is not much substance here.  The baseball scenes are weak and the romance is tepid.  The film has some endearing moments but fails to distinguish itself except that it gets goofy far too often.  I rated it a 5/10.  Fans of Prinze and Biel will enjoy seeing them look sexy for an hour and three quarters.  Others might want to miss it.",1011398400,,1603,4.691756272401434
