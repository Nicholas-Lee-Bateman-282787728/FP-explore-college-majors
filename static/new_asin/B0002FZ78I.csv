2098164,5,B0002FZ78I,"I was recently able to purchase this movie secondhand, and I have to say that it is a really outstanding film. The theme of the movie is forgiveness and the importance of family, and there is a little romance thrown in as well. It's an excellent family film with no swearing. The acting by Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds is superb.

Will is a young man who moves from New York to manage the family realitor business after the death of his grandfather. Will grew up with his grandparents because his parents were killed in a tragic car accident when he was very young. Therefore his grandparents were the most important people in his life, and Will knew that they were very close to each other throughout their married life. As he said, they were so close they were almost like one person. After his grandfather's death, his grandmother Ruth starts to read her husband's journals that he wrote in volumes, one for every year of their married life. In the journals it mentions that he goes to see a woman named Lillian every Christmas Eve and other times as well. It was a secret that he kept from Ruth and she and Will fear the worst. Ruth's Christmas wish is to know the answer to the mystery, and Will is determined to find out who Lillian was and why his grandfather would keep this a secret from the family. In his quest, Will finds the answer to this haunting family mystery and finds romance along the way. I would highly recommend this film.

Just an additional note that there is another movie called ""A Christmas Wish"" but it is a classic with Jimmy Durante & Terry Moore, and has a completely different storyline. I see that it is being incorrectly advertized on amazon as a Neil Patrick Harris film. So, I'm just mentioning it so that you get the one you want. I have both versions as I am a big fan of Christmas movies. This one, from 1998, is only available used at this time.",1157155200,39,1897,4.448275862068965

2098166,5,B0002FZ78I,"This movie is about a man that walked in humility and forgiveness.  It is not about 'Doogie' Howser OR Debbie Reynolds although they are both brilliant actors.  The main theme forms around a grandfather that leaves his grandson a wonderful legacy: how to live in humility and truly love your fellowman.  A mystery is uncovered by the Grandmother (Debbie Reynolds)and shared with the grandson (Neil Patrick Harris). A Christmas entry into the Grandfather's journal 'visit Lillian' has them wondering, who is Lillian?  The grandmother asks her grandson to please find out who Lillian is as her Christmas Gift from him.  So, the adventure begins.  Through his searching, he comes to know who his grandfather really is but it isn't until the last 5 minutes of the film that you find out who Lillian is...and, when you do, it will bring you to tears as it does to me every time I watch it.  I highly recommend this film ... have a box of tissues close by.",1102118400,71,950,4.686746987951807

watts plays the former loyal secretary of doogie's father & now

single mother of another precocious kid, like the ring.  she also looks good in tights as a ballet instructor.

2098173,5,B0002FZ78I,It is an superb story.  The grandson finally got the message his grandma was giving him on what matters most. Debbie Reynolds has been in so many delightful movies.,1506988800,,164,4.655172413793103
2098174,1,B0002FZ78I,"A businessman Will Martin tries to uncover a family secret for his grandmother Ruth Martin after he returns to a small town to modernize his family's real-estate company. During thanksgiving dinner his grandmother Ruth tells him she has discovered a woman named Lillian in her husbands Warren's journals. He had visited her every Christmas Eve. Will sets off to solve this mystery.

Now this film is all talk. It's also very quite. Not much happens and the mystery is interesting my not enough to hold most peoples interest.

However what got me through this film was a game. The film had many familiar locations that have been utilized in other films. This film in Southern California and most likely in the Summer. I recognized several locations that were used in ""Friday the 13th Part IV"" and ""Friday the 13th Part V"". The Jarvis home from ""Part IV"". There is also a location from Part V that is used. You will see Neil Patrick Harris by gas pumps. This location is where Lana worked at a diner.

Anyway this film is not boring but its not very interesting. Even Debbie Reynolds scenes are almost limited to one location.

This was not a bad movie but it could of been much better.",1505865600,,1184,4.623809523809523

These two actors are wonderful together, very believable.  The little boy is charming and a good actor.  There is just enough mystery to keep you interested and the solution is very touching. Also, just to see Neil tell off the snobbish boring girlfriend is worth watching it.

2098215,3,B0002FZ78I,"I've lost track of how many Christmas movies I've seen. I'm split on this one. What I liked about it I really liked. It wasn't cheesy or overly-sappy nor overly-sentimental. The casting of Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds was fantastic. I could have done without the social commentary on the proper way to run a business -- this bumped one star off for me. Where I'm really split:

MAJOR SPOILER

I had an idea of who Lillian was from the very beginning but poo-pooed the idea because it was a ridiculous notion. I was right in the end. Lillian was the woman who killed Martin's son and daughter-in-law -- and became an invalid. My biggest issue with this -- no way Ruth didn't know the name of the woman who killed her son. It doesn't matter that 24 years had passed; that name would be etched in her brain. This is the main reason for three stars.",1478995200,3,856,4.4113924050632916

2098310,5,B0002FZ78I,"I love Christmas movies that are romantic. This one wasn't just romantic, it was like an old fashioned Christmas story with a surprising mystery.
Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds were wonderful in this movie. Neil plays a guy named Will Martin, a real-estate agent, who was raised by his grandparents after his parents had perished in a car accident. His grandfather, Warren ran a successful real-estate business, and was a loyal person to his wife, Ruth (Debbie Reynolds), family, and his employees. When Warren passes on, Will comes and stays with his grandmother, Ruth, so they can settle Warren's estate.  One night at dinner, Ruth tells Will that she'd been looking through Warren's library of journals from all the years that they were married, and comes across one that mentions about a woman named Lillian, who he'd see every Christmas Eve. Ruth is anxious to know who Lillian is, and asks Will to search for answers. Will starts a search for the mysterious Lillian, wondering if she was a mistress, or perhaps a long, lost relative. Will begins his search by reading the journals, visiting business associates and friends of Warren's, going through Warren's personal effects, but always runs into dead ends.  On the way, he meets a woman named Renee, who once worked for Warren, and now runs her own dance studio.  She's also divorced with a young son, Justin, who immediately likes Will. (Will likes Justin too.) The two of them join Will on his search. Will and Renee also begin to fall in love!
At the same time, Will is also deciding whether or not to sell the family real-estate business. Fortunately, in the end, he decides to keep it. All the employees are overjoyed.
When it seems like Will is out of ideas in his search, the three go to a Christmas tree farm to buy a tree. Will meets the owner, Jose Rivera, who actually knew Warren, and said that Warren always bought two trees. One for him and Ruth, and one for a place called the Martha Fields Nursing Home. Will goes there later, and meets Mrs. Baker, the manager, who mentions about Warren's visits every Christamas Eve, and also that he'd always go upstairs to visit with a woman named Lillian. Will's eyes light up. Mrs. Baker explains that Lillian is the longest living resident at the home (she had no family), and has been in bad health for some time. It also turns out that she was the mysterious driver who had fallen asleep at the wheel, and caused the the car accident.  Warren probably always visited Lillian as a way of forgiving her. Mrs. Baker takes Will upstairs to see Lillian.  Back at Ruth's house, while she, Will, Renee, and Justin are giving each other gifts, Will tells Ruth he has one special gift for her. The four go to the nursing home, and Will tells Ruth Mrs. Baker's story, then takes Ruth upstairs to meet Lillian. Ruth sits by Lillian, who's in bed, holds Lillian's hand, smiles at her and tells her she forgives her. Lillian smiles at Ruth. Ruth got her Christmas wish! Later, she, Will, Renee, and Justin sing Christmas carols with Mrs. Baker, and the other residents. Mystery solved!
This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. I'll always cherish it.",1386460800,2,3166,4.697297297297298
2098311,4,B0002FZ78I,"This movie has two actors that I enjoy - Debbie Reynolds and Neil Patric Harris - which is why I chose it.  It was a different plot than many of the Christmas movies that are sold today, and epitomizes the concept of believing what is right and good, despite reasonable doubt.  Harris plays the grandson of Reynolds, who has inherited his grandfather's real estate business.  He is attempting to get the business into a position that he can oversee from his home in New York, where he is a shrewd Wall Street trader.  His grandmother tells him of her desire to know about a woman that his grandfather mentions in his journals, every Christmas Eve.  The mystery is the main plot of the story, as Harris plays novice detective, while trying to manage the real estate office.  As a result of both tasks, he learns more and more about his grandfather, his parents, and (of course) about himself.  The mystery of the woman in the journal doesn't come to an easy conclusion, and along the way to solving it, Harris develops a desire to be the kind of person his grandfather was...generous and kind.",1386460800,4,1092,4.597938144329897

2098340,5,B0002FZ78I,"This is one of my favorite Christmas Movies because of the beautiful family relationships. The journey the grandson takes to unravel a mystery for his beloved Grandmother, helps him reconnect to his grandfathers integrity and allows him to evaluate his own.  I love the way it stays a mystery to the very end only to find the beauty of forgiveness.  Wonderful acting, characters, music and storyline.

2098342,5,B0002FZ78I,"First, I love Christmas movies.  The Christmas Wish has about everything you could
want in a movie except Santa Clause.  This movie has mystery, romance, love of life
and tradition, how to forgive for a great loss, and what seems to be a behind the
scenes change for the characters for the greater good. It's not religious, but it
is just shy of it. This is one fine movie.  I gave it a 5 rating only because there
is no 6.  I bought mine in vhs, I wish it had been DVD, my only regret.",1344211200,,486,4.08421052631579

2098344,5,B0002FZ78I,"One of the most powerful stories about love and forgiveness I've seen. Appropriate for any season, not really a Christmas story. Acting is fine and the storyline moves along nicely.

2098347,4,B0002FZ78I,"I saw this last year as a partial program. I looked for it in stores and on the web. It was hard to find. I foud it this year and obtained it. It's not as mopey as a lot of this type program is. Good cast and the plot kept me guessing to the end. I enjoyed it. I've watched it a couple times now, and it will be a Christmas staple for me.

It's a made for TV program that's better than a lot of the progams that are shown over and over again. So far this year no cable station around here has run it. It costs a little more than most, but I think it's worth it.

2098348,5,B0002FZ78I,This movie the first time I watched it had me hooked from the first. You have to watch it just to find out who Lillian is. And the fact that the grandson reevaluates his life and realizes what is good and decent in people is uplifting. Well worth the watch.  Fair warning! Have Kleenex on hand.,1323216000,,294,4.25
2098349,5,B0002FZ78I,The video came before it was supposed too!  We were hoping it would be here before Christmas but ordered it a little late.

2098353,5,B0002FZ78I,"This,  as has been stated,  is a wonderful Christmas movie with an interesting story, and important messages about honesty, loyalty, tradition and forgiveness.  The characters find ways to go on with their lives and find happiness even though sadness is an ever present part of their lives too.  The movie offers no quick fix happy endings, happiness exists along side of pain, as it does in real life.  Also of note, among a good cast, all doing a great job,  is Debbie Reynolds doing her best acting work in quite some time.  She  is subtile, subdued and genuine in her performance.  The Reynolds glitzy persona is buried into her character, a recently widowed, somewhat reserved woman.  If you are a fan of Reynolds check this film out!",1292630400,,739,4.748031496062992

2098356,5,B0002FZ78I,"Before How I Met Your Mother, Neil Patrick Harris was in this lovely TV holiday movie. Part mystery, part love story, the movie stresses the importance of family, traditions, empathy and forgiveness.  Debbie Reynolds gives a lovely understated performance as the grandmother who asks him for a gift that requires him to search through his late grandfather's past and also decide what is really important in his own life.  Our family was thrilled to find a copy of the movie through Amazon that was in excellent condition and had never been opened.  Maybe some day the movie will again be released for purchase, so everyone can make it part of their Christmas movie collection.",1266105600,,676,4.912280701754386

I have ordered a variety of items through Amazon, from an electric skillet to a Sony Bravia TV and I'm totally satisfied with the quality of product as well as the awesome delivery.",1264118400,,449,4.555555555555555

2098359,5,B0002FZ78I,"This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It exemplifies what Christmas is supposed to be about. It is well written, performed well, and is uplifting and inspiring. There is a thread of romance through the story, but as others have written, the main storyline is a grandson coming home to take care of his grandfather's affairs after he dies. Grandpa had a real estate company and the grandson hires a manager to run it for him, but he clashes with loyal, long-time employees. His grandma is reading her husband's journals and sees repeated references of visits her husband made to someone named ""Lillian"", but there are no details.  She asks her grandson, as his Christmas gift to her, to find out who ""Lillian"" is.  He wants to get things wrapped up and get back to his real life, but between the problems in the real estate office , the mystery of Lillian, and his developing feelings for his grandpa's former secretary, he can't seem to pull himself away. Through it all, what they really learn is what the grandfather was all about. The ending took me by surprise the first time I watched it, and it continues to move me with each viewing.
This is not ""just another Christmas movie"" with a syrupy storyline and a too-good-to-be-true ending. This is a quality production about a life well-lived. I wish it was still available new, as it makes a great Christmas gift.",1256601600,6,1373,4.669421487603306

2098363,5,B0002FZ78I,"I won't spoil the mystery but this is one of those truly charming tales that will make you cry, smile, and shake your head in wonder.

A young man has come home to his small town roots to put his grandfather's affairs in order.  The man has been living in the big city and his attitude is one of snobbish sophistication...""Grandfather was a nice old man, but that was THEN...times have changed.""

He has every intention of selling off his grandfather's company (and the dozens of jobs) and going back to his grand city life.

Only he meets this young woman with a little boy...and Grandmother finds a little mystery that might make it real easy to leave his sainted grandfather's legacy behind.

As he falls for the young woman and her child, he finds himself wanting to keep the memory of the good grandfather intact...and all the clues that points to an unfaithful old grandpa start to irritate; especially since EVERYONE is so sure that a more wonderful man never lived.

Of course Grandfather wasn't having an affair.  Of course he was as wonderful as everyone thinks he is.

But...

But just how good the man REALLY was will leave the viewer breathless.",1193529600,21,1158,4.637254901960785
