It is made from dirt and special tubes that can be bought from Earth works or made from the bags you get from the grocery store. Anyway, the point is you can build a small shelter using the knowledge found on this DVD! If you have some land you can build this small shelter! If you watch this DVD closely, you can build your own emergency shelter, or make it bigger for a house! Its all made from dirt and the special bag/tubes!",1265760000,,482,4.138297872340425
8315017,2,B001KJAPVO,"Was very disappointed in this video.  First, it was expensive considering what it contained.  If you have ever looked into earthbag construction, save your money and don't buy this.  Buy the earthbag house book.  Nothing was in real detail and the filming was very poor quality, like someone took their home video and put it on dvd.  No sound and no real detail.  Guess it was made to be sent to 3rd world countries to give them the idea of sandbag building?  Good idea, bad dvd.  Wish someone would make one from start to finish of a real Earthbag house.  The book is informative but a good DVD would be exciting and inspiring.",1262563200,5,628,4.486725663716814
