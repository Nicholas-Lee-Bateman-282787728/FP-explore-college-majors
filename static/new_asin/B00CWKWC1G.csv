5743510,5,B00CWKWC1G,"Awesome, absolutely brilliant piece of work.  Courtney Brown is a true pioneer, this information is priceless.  His outstanding work validates we are more than a body, we do have a history, and this planet has had many advanced civilizations before us, humanity has to wake up and move off the current course we are on, and create a much better timeline for all, it is possible, the future is not set in concrete.",1381881600,4,413,4.6438356164383565

This is very scientific with absolutely no special effects, which I personally don't have a problem with

For most people it will seem boring since it is not in any way sensationalistic!",1379289600,2,292,4.705882352941177
5743512,3,B00CWKWC1G,"Not quite what I expected--it's just a person talking to the camera, then a few people offering drawings and observations. Yes, it is interesting, but I suspect some would find it rather dry.",1378166400,6,191,4.818181818181818
5743513,5,B00CWKWC1G,"I have been curious about Atlantis for a long time, but never found anything I would consider ""concrete"" evidence of what it might have been.  This amazing DVD tells a fascinating and startling story!  Using evidence provided by military-grade Remote Viewing, Courtney Brown describes the origins and demise of undersea structures seen via Google Earth.  There is a story here I have not found anywhere else.  It can be dry at times, the meat of the story is a couple of chapters in.  But when you get there hold on to your hat.  If you want to find out more about Remote Viewing, advanced technology on the bottom of the ocean, and what might have wiped out most of humanity 70,000 years ago, this is the DVD for you.  This is shot in the style of a documentary, so please note that if you are looking for a Hollywood-type movie this is not it.",1376611200,15,845,4.4480519480519485
8586956,1,B00CWKWC1G,"I have seed the DVD along with many OTHER DVD's put out
by Courtney Brown and can say for a fact there is no better
way to be bored to death than to listen to one. While it
is true that Remote Viewing is a reality, it is NOT true that
it is the ultimate truth about a subject especially one like
the Atlantis story. REAL honest remote viewing demands
verifiable data to back up the remote viewing session. There IS
no feedback verification for Atlantis. If you want to learn about
Remote Viewing and gain an insight about the many topics that
have been ""remote viewed"", then read the works done by the real
remote viewers: Joe McMoneagle, Paul Smith, Lynn Buchanan, Skip Atwater.
Most if not all the material I have seen so far advertised on Amazon regarding
remote viewing is misleading at best. I can honestly say this because I
have been involved with remote viewing for twenty years and know the
difference between authentic RV and shams. But we are all
entitled to our opinions aren't we? My advice to anyone who wants
to learn about Remote Viewing is ""do your home work."" Don't just
accept every book that you see written as fact. Most of the new
books out there on Remote viewing are written by late comers or
""want to Be's"" who stretch REAL remote viewing beyond credible limits.

8586957,5,B00CWKWC1G,I am on board with this idea after watching this movie as it is explained well and the alternative is not. We found it fascinating and dumbfounding to have this truth revealed as the pieces all fall into place. It is terrifying to realize that we are at the same place today that they were in Atlantis when they 'accidentally'  ended their civilization. Everyone should see this story.,1428710400,2,385,4.661764705882353
8586958,4,B00CWKWC1G,As always agreat job by Mr. Brown and his colleagues'. His R.V.'s are the best!!!!!!,1428451200,,84,4.666666666666667
8586959,5,B00CWKWC1G,Extremely informative and mind opening.,1421280000,,39,7.0
8586960,1,B00CWKWC1G,You would be better off going to website and reading the sessions. Courtney does way too much talking and not all the information is on the Dvd. Much more information at website. A little disappointed with Dvd.,1411862400,3,210,4.702702702702703
8586961,5,B00CWKWC1G,Very interesting perspective on past events that caused Atlantis to sink into the ocean. Correlating ocean floor Google mapping with remote viewing.,1410739200,,148,5.7727272727272725
8586962,4,B00CWKWC1G,"""The True Story"" may be stretching it a little. It has a lot of pieces missing.
But it is real evidence for the existence of that fabled place, what it looked like, and how it failed - almost taking the planet with it.
You should know the data in this DVD and you deserve to know it.",1397692800,4,283,3.982456140350877
8586963,1,B00CWKWC1G,"This is a video just like another he made about the ""ruse"" of Jesus Christ. In this DVD, Mr. Brown is the only  person shown and  speaking all throughout a very lengthy and drawn-out lecture. He claims that he has a team of Remote Viewers who have been hired by intelligence agencies in the past to travel though space (mentally) and draw pictures of what they see on sheets of paper. This type of RV does work in real life, but he claims that the remote viewers can actually see events in the future, and from the past. This claim has never been shown to actually work. Everything he says in the video is pure speculation.
Another thing, in past months, he has been touting a disclosure that he would make public in February of this year (2014) on Facebook. Now the real truth came out.
So the real fanfare of the ""February disclosure"" is nothing more than the sale of Mr. Brown's new video ""Atlantis the true story"". NICE WAY TO USE FACEBOOK to advertise by rising the public interest and rally the public's susceptibility and hunger for surprises !  Mr. Brown claims to be a Scientist, which I doubt; however, he is a good salesman though !",1392336000,3,1143,4.45933014354067
8586964,4,B00CWKWC1G,This is an interesting video that explores what may have happened to Atlantis. I like the video and I like the work of Dr. Brown so I think that it is a valuable addition to any remote viewing collection. It is also good to support the efforts made by people who want to get the word out about remote viewing. Dr. Brown has been getting the word out for years and so you will like this video!,1389916800,6,392,4.103896103896104
8586965,4,B00CWKWC1G,"An interesting take on the fate of ""Atlantis"". . whether you believe or not, it's still a different take on the distant past",1386201600,3,124,4.434782608695652
