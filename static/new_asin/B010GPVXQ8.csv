If you are expecting to hear all 19 songs from the CD, go with the CD instead.",1445731200,2,313,4.305084745762712

8722479,5,B010GPVXQ8,This was such an incredible behind the scenes look at one of my favorite new Christmas records. The Boy's Choir of St. Paul are so gifted. The music is hauntingly beautiful! I have the full album and listen to it outside of the Christmas season - it is that good. Great DVD - great for the classical music fan and for any music snob!,1441843200,,333,4.21875
8722480,5,B010GPVXQ8,Incredible Doc! The album is incredible and I love having the DVD with all of the behind the scenes. I saw this on PBS over Christmas and loved it. My kids love this album and the DVD is great addition to the album! Also the DVD was really well - done - high quality and they have extra features that I had not previously seen. 5-Stars!!!!,1435449600,2,339,4.151515151515151
