2869475,5,B000RMJ4EE,"To be honest, I thought this movie was really good.  For a low budget flick, I don't think Romero himself could have done better.  If you are a fan of zombie movies or books this has a little of both.  With the all important shot to the head to kill them.  This movie also got me thinking.  If i was in a zombie incident what kinda of zombie would I like to deal with.  Obviously the slow and moany ones.  I think it started with 28 days later.  All of a sudden we have zombie like creatures tearing after people like the Flash.  To much for me.  Kinda scares the heck out of me.",1204934400,3,579,4.0
2869476,4,B000RMJ4EE,This movie was a decent addition to the Zombie Genre. Had good gore. Lots of Zombies. What more could you ask for. Better acting? Of course. But what would you expect from a Zombie movie.,1204761600,4,187,4.371428571428571
2869477,4,B000RMJ4EE,"Well, I just finished watching Automation Transfusion and I can honestly say that I was entertained and satified. I agree with the other review about the acting and the plot, there both pretty lame.  But really, what do you watch a zombie flick for anyway?  The GORE right!  And plenty of gore there is!  The gore fx was done really well in this movie, so when you have good gore fx in a zombie movie, the plot and acting doesn't really matter does it? If you want good acting and a good plot also,  I recommend George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead. If your just all about the gore, then Automation Transfusion should satisfy.",1204675200,3,643,4.369747899159663
2869478,2,B000RMJ4EE,"Automaton Transfusion is an ultra low budget, gore-fest, zombie bash that has been made my some obvious zombie flick fanatics, but sadly any potential that it has gets squandered.  The story, for lack of a better word, revolves around a group of high school seniors that get caught in the middle of a zombie epidemic, and try to get out of town.  While story isn't really all that important in a pure zombie flick, it would be nice if we at least cared a little bit about the characters here.  We don't, at all, and instead just pray for their bloody demise.  It should also be noted that these zombies are of the running variety, which would mean that the action and scares would be aplenty.  Well, they aren't either, and the film as a whole just comes off as boring.  There are loads of gore effects, where most of Automaton Transfusion's budget seemed to go.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, as the gore effects are quite well done for a low budget flick, and are every bit as disgusting as any gorehound could hope for (one scene in particular will leave your jaw on the floor, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about), and are reason enough to check out this flick.  Other than that though, there really isn't much else to Automaton Transfusion.  Maybe that's all fine and good for you, and if so then by all means check this out.  If you're looking for something that has a little bit of depth to it however (and doesn't have a grainy picture either), then Automaton Transfusion is definitely not for you.",1204588800,19,1542,4.494623655913978
2869479,3,B000RMJ4EE,"This film is as easy as it gets to follow.  It's just one of those movies about a military experiment gone awry. There's no originality, suspense, it isn't scary, and you don't care about the characters at all.  There's also a problem with the films frame rate.  It looks like it's missing frames, or the frame rate is slow.  This frame rate problem gets more noticeable during the action sequences.  There's a lot of violence, gore, and fast running zombies; but the gore decreases during the climax.  Not only does it have a bad ending, but I was disappointed because I wanted more gore towards the end.  However, I still thought the film was pretty fun to watch, but a lot of people won't like it.  The pace is fast, and it has good gore FX.  It's one of those movies that isn't meant to be analyzed.

The quality is pretty good, but it's in non anamorphic widescreen.",1350259200,,871,4.455696202531645
2869480,2,B000RMJ4EE,"This movie started off really well.  The introduction was solid.  However, the movie fell apart along the way when you couldn't find the storyline.  And you didn't share an interest in the two lovers.  One character was remotely interesting and he was pretty good.  The african american actor who was very good in the film.  I admire the filmmakers enthusiasm and they did some very nice shots and setps but as a whole, it was empty and you didn't care or even remember the characters.  And for the film ""to be continued"" was a little pretentious of them, assuming they would have a hit and garnered interest for a second film.  Good shot, guys ... in places a lot of fun but fell short in the character and plotline",1349222400,,716,4.496124031007752
2869481,5,B000RMJ4EE,"This movie is bashed by most Amazon critics and rightly so. But to me it was the little details I enjoyed that gave the film a cult status. I will relate these to you and try not to ruin too much of the plot...if that is possible in a zombie film which are all pretty much the same...dead come back to life, kill other people, people fight off zombies.

The movie opens in a morgue where the mortician has a stethoscope! (add a star) A young man who can't stand the sight of blood barfs in a bio hazard container. A man gets bitten by a zombie as his blood squirts several feet into the air. After the credits we get a high school setting. Juliet Reeves stars as Jackie, who gets topless from a cheerleader's outfit (add 1 star). The movie has some great goth/grunge music (add a star). In high school math they were on page 649! What a progressive school. I don't even recall seeing a math book with that many pages in it. And the black kid just happens to have on a set of brass knuckles (not exactly allowed in most high schools) when the zombie attacks him.! These are fast moving zombies and not the slow, drag a leg, and can step out of the way, type of zombies. Mom, who bites the face off of her son wears a ""kiss the cook"" apron (add a star). Son is wearing a Ramones presidential seal tee. This is a rare variety as normally the lettering is either all white or all red. This one has white letters and a red ""O"" in the middle. Garrett Jones stars as Chris, a high school teen with a bad Mohawk and a Dancefloor Tragedy tee, who have a song about tipping your bartender. Chris ends up trapped in a bar. A zombie pulls a bloody fetus (or is it a doll?) out of a girl's stomach, girls' head getting ripped off, bloody skull on barroom floor, and head's being blown apart (add 1 star). The slowly opening garage door with a chainsaw in hand and William Howard Bowman saying, ""Ash would be so proud."" A reference to Bruce Campbell's character in the ""Evil Dead"" series (add 1 star). Zombies playing dead to trap their prey. Lee, the janitor, eventually explains the missing plot points and brings this thing home.

And of course there is a character named ""Tim."" Tim or ""Timothy"" as you may recall was eaten in a 1971 hit song by The Bouys. That song was written by Rupert Holmes, who also wrote ""Escape"" and both were referenced on an MST 3000 episode, where this movie really belongs. Coincidence? I think not!

F-bomb, underage drinking, drug use, sex, nudity, blood, gore, and no ending. Should go great with the funny stuff.

2869482,1,B000RMJ4EE,"I just watched this, I won't spoil it for you, the director already did.  It ends with buy part 2 if they ever make it?  Trouble is I don't care if they do or not.  I would not waste the money to see the ending.  Some of the acting was OK, but it a 75 minute dvd that will make a better skeet target then video.",1318118400,2,311,3.6666666666666665
2869483,3,B000RMJ4EE,"""What do you like, love, or dislike about it?""

I liked the better-than-average amateur quality of this fine zombie production. I liked the very slighty jerky quality of the camera work, not seizure-inducing mind you, but it gave an frenetic effect to the action and tenseness.

What did I REALLY dislike about it? That 75 minutes into the movie (SPOILER ALERT!) as the heroes are cornered outside the locked door to the morgue with dozens of zombies closing in on them...

""To Be Continued""

I don't mean my review will be continued. That's HOW THE MOVIE ENDED...!!!  That's B.S. man! Bee... Ess...!",1316736000,,600,4.8431372549019605
2869484,2,B000RMJ4EE,"I guess this is what you get with a paltry $30,000 stake. Or as I like to call it - Shaky Cam Nirvana. Visually, AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION is actually decent, with most of the money I'm guessing going to the gory, over-the-top special effects. And when I'm dropping descriptives like ""over-the-top"" when referencing a zombie flick, then realize that the filmmakers have exceeded even the generous leeway this genre allows. Munching on baby fetus is a mite too much. However, I did relish the scenes with the nasty back breaking and the jaw ripping and the cheek chewing. When it comes to zombie dining etiquette, Emily Post would be aghast.

Thankfully running at a mere 75 minutes, AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION strives for that lean and mean sensibility, and it halfway achieves it. The action kicks off just about right away, with not much of a set-up (although, with a zombie flick, how much back story do you really need?). Oh, there is an explanation for this zombie outburst, but you have to sit thru most of the flick before you get it. And wouldn't you know it, it's yet another government experiment gone horribly wrong. Someday, there'll be a government touting not an ounce of hubris, and ne'er will zombies darken that reality.

What's a horror picture without randy, frightened teens? This movie's writer certainly isn't willing to find out, and so he peppers in plenty of panicked high schoolers running around and screaming and crying, the more for the zombies to hear them with. It's not enough that these ghouls can smell living flesh. They also get auditory aid.

I'm of the school of not actually minding that the undead aren't of the George Romero persuasion, slow, shuffling, stumbly. And, in this case, these fleet meat-munchers are that much quicker to dispose of these uncharismatic young actors, so goody goody.

What I've learned from this film:

- When zombies overrun neighboring towns, they'll fix it so that the streets and highways are cleared of ALL vehicles, which will then allow the main protagonist to get all suspicious because there's not one friggin' car on the road during rush hour.

- A fat janitor will pass muster as an Army officer because he is chomping on a cigar, and this apparently lends him instant credibility.

- Zombie flicks are governed by scintillating scripts which compel one student, while seeking safe haven, to stridently ask his buddy while in his buddy's garage, ""How far to the school?!"" Even though he himself is a local and he'd been giving rides to his pal in that same neighborhood since forever. Maybe he gets lost a lot.

The story is barely one. To be fair, several of the teen actors aren't bad. It's the script that deals out flat characterization. You can distinguish the acting between most of the ""live"" cast and the zombies in that at least the zombies seem to go about their business with a purpose. The ones milling about, hysterically crying out: ""Oh, God, no!"" Yeah, those are the guys we're supposed to root for.

The film gets extra points from me for having the chutzpah to end on a cliffhanger. No guts, no glory. Who knows? I may even see the sequel once these guys get another $30,000.

This is the ""Unrated & Undead"" version (I actually don't know if there is any other version) and the DVD's bonus stuff goes like so: audio commentary by writer/director Steven C. Miller and producers William Clevinger and Mark Thalman; ""Trials and Tribulations"" - the Making Of featurette (00:25:49 minutes long); ""Suffer or Sacrifice"" - the 2004 short film shot, edited, and scored in 48 hours by director Steven C. Miller as part of the Florida 48 Hour Film Festival (00:04:54 minutes); 4 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary (totaling 00:02:33 minutes and including death scenes by the director and the producer, respectively); two music videos: Blinded Black's ""Can You Hear Me Now?"" and Dancefloor Tragedy's ""Arsenaholic""; and the movie trailer.",1307145600,,3928,4.875562218890555
2869485,3,B000RMJ4EE,"At first when I played this ,I thought it was a Bootleg or something. I bought it for $9.99 from Best Buy, part of a 2-Pack with Black Sheep. Bad News all around. This is Part 1 of a Trilogy. The Automaton Transfusion 2 is planned to be released in 2012. Maybe with all the sucker sales they'll be able to get a decent camera to use. Don't you feel like a sucker for buying this. If they had used a decent camera to film then this would be a decent Zombie Flick. I've seen worse Zombie Movies. Zombie Toxin for example with a cast of four. I've seen Zombie Movies where it looks like Melted Ice Cream was used for the Makeup. The Makeup effects for AT was better than average.

2869486,1,B000RMJ4EE,"I'll start by saying that I'm not easily offended, so anyone that would suggest that I am slighting this movie due to some bias towards either the zombie subgenre or feature-length independent films can rest assured that I am an avid fan of the former and occasionally enjoy the latter.

Purchased on a whim from Wal-mart [and sadly not the discount bin], this is the only ""film"" I have ever stopped watching. I made it to the fetus being ripped from the teen mother and another teen having her head ripped from her shoulders before I ejected the movie in a rage and threw it in the trash.

First and foremost, using children -- especially infants [and it should go without say, fetuses] -- is cheap, gaudy, and is often nothing more than a gimmick employed by non-creative people that want to shock their audience.

E.g., watching a baby carriage swept toward the camera by a massive wave during a scene from The Day After Tomorrow (2004)

These ""shocking"" visuals often do nothing to further the story, which is my biggest issue with their inclusion in the film.

It's quite frankly embarrassing, and makes for an awkward situation when someone walks into the room only to see that scene.

Pet Cemetery did an excellent job of this, as did -- to my surprise -- Dawn of the Dead (2004). Automaton Transfusion, however, did not. Don't try to shock me or make my care with a heavy-handed attempt to rip at my heartstrings... which leads me to my second issue.

The ~$30,000-$50,000 budget should not have been tapped until at least 3 people over the age of 18 that were not a parent/guardian of the filmmakers read the script. I fully support creative minds -- regardless of their age -- but the plot [up until the point when I admittedly bailed] was juvenile, awkwardly-constructed, and reeked of ""hey, what're you doing this weekend?"".

I wish the filmmakers all the best, but can not in good conscience give this movie more than 1 star and highly recommend that you stay far, far way from it.",1299024000,,1994,4.628895184135978

2869488,1,B000RMJ4EE,"I've watched a lot of low-budget zombie films, and this is truly one of the worst. It was more a loosely connected montage of gory set pieces than a fully realized film with an actual story, and when the story does seem to finally kick in, the movie pulls the rug out from under the viewer's feet. Absolutely terrible.",1294099200,,318,4.406779661016949
2869489,1,B000RMJ4EE,"I am a HUGE zombie movie fan, and I truly didn't think there would ever be a zombie flick that I would ever hate. I saw this at Walmart for $9 and I figured why not, it's a zombie flick, the cover looks amazing, and it's cheap. So I got it and my friends and I watched it a couple days later. Within the first 15 minutes my friends and I were heavily debating whether or not to keep watching. We decided to just to see if it would get any better. It didn't, and one of my friends fell asleep halfway through.

The camera work is POORLY done, and I mean probably the worst in any movie I've ever seen. It seemed kinda glitchy with a bad frame rate, like you were watching a low video quality on the internet with a dialup connection. Way too shaky too.

The acting was horrendous, I mean usually with zombie films that's to be expected but the acting in this was just annoying.

The story was...well...I don't even know what to say about that. Was there even really a story about it aside from zombies that were intended to be used for military purposes? And in the movie there's a large group of young adults attending a party, but at this point the entire world has seemingly been killed or zombiefied, yet NOBODY of the few people left knows anything about the attacks or what's going on. If the entire area was already dead or turned into zombies, how could not one single person know what's going on and be oblivious to everything? And they all clearly had access to phones seeing as how you see people using cellphones in the film. It was so boring too I thought.

My friends and I HATED, and I mean HATED this film. I will admit there were maybe 2 or 3 really cool SMALL zombie attack scenes that were well done, but that's it.

TRUST me when I say don't buy this. Go buy any other zombie movie and you'll be better off.

The film leaves off opening for a second film, as it says ""To be continued..."" I really hope it's never made.",1285113600,,1937,4.221621621621622
2869490,1,B000RMJ4EE,"This movie had the right quotes to catch your attention, on the cover, but did not live up to it.  It had potential, plot wise, if your a zombie fan, you know the basics, heres mine.

-do not watch a zombie flick with high expectations, so if its good you'll be surprised

-usually when the movie has a dark worn out look during the movie due to the camera it was shot with, get ready for sub par acting and a lot of ""WTF's!"" moments

the rest you can fill in with your personal taste

But this movie, did okay for the budget it was given, which is not really saying much. They did good job adding a lot zombies to make it look like a lots going on, just so they can cover up certain inperfections, one of the characters (the black guy) picks up a chainsaw but doesnt turn it on, you don't hear it, but somehow hes cutting down zombies.........??????? There were one or two cool effects, horrible make-up for the zomibes( white powder on the face and Fake blood) some scenes looked obvious that they squirted blood on sheets and on the wall, and the ending.....SPOILER ALERT!!!, SPOILER ALERT!!! It ends in a ""to be continued'..............  As if I want to wait for the second one to know what happens and waste my time.

2869492,2,B000RMJ4EE,"hmm. .

They went for the ""Shock"" factor, and that does work in some places.

But they had no idea how to translate the rest of their ideas into a GOOD film.

For gore-hounds, there are some outstanding scenes (the Morgue kill that opens the film, the jaw ripped off), as well as some things never done before in a zombie film (the ""baby"" scene that folks are talking about, as well as a GREAT ""Jaws"" riff).

Unlike others, I didn't mind the camera choices -- although yes, it does feel a bit too ""arty for arts sakes"".

But the Gore makeup is good, some of the ideas are good.

Unfortunately 3 things really kill the enjoyment of this short (1:15) film:

1) The Acting is really, really bad.  It's hard to take the characters seriously when the acting is so poor.

2) There simply IS no story until just about 12 minutes until the end of the film.

3) Plot holes galore -- some of them so major it pulls you out of the film.  The ""students"" all drive 50 minutes to get to this party. . yet the school is just over the hill and they can run to it?  WTF?

I got it off Amazon for .01 used (so plus shipping was about $3).  For $3 I don't feel cheated, but I certainly wouldn't pay more for it than that.",1281139200,,1202,4.103004291845494
2869493,2,B000RMJ4EE,"I'm a gorehound who is willing to accept gore for gore's sake - but Automaton Transfusion just struck me as a totally pointless film.  Yes, there is a lot of blood and gore, but it's nothing I haven't seen before, and what I assume was supposed to be the most visceral moment in the film came across as somewhat comical to me.  I also found it somewhat awkward that the filmmakers would suddenly decide to cram a storyline in to the film with about fifteen minutes to go.  It's as if they set out to make a film in search of a plot but chickened out at the last minute.  I guess they did achieve their goal of making a zombie film that starts out kicking it hardcore and keeps the blood flowing until the very end, but it came at the expense of both story and character development.  I only liked one character in the whole movie, and he ultimately let me down by going squirrelly on me.  As for the ending, I have to be blunt and say it totally sucked - a true WTF moment, and not in a good way.

This film was reportedly shot in nine days at a cost of just thirty thousand dollars.  That being the case, the gory special effects are impressive.  It's actually too much of a good thing, though, because all the pointless bloodshed eventually ends up boring the experienced horror movie fan.  Even the title bugs me because I have no idea what it is referring to.  Maybe I would have found out if I had bothered to watch the movie again with the director/producer commentary, but I really had no desire to sit through this nonsense a second time.  I tried watching the making-of featurette, but after about five minutes I decided that I really just didn't care.

The gore scenes don't last 2 seconds, the camera doesn't shake like crazy and you can see all of the details. Most of the gore scenes in this movie are so short and shaky that you can't really see the details. What's the point of spending a lot of money on an effect if you're not going to show it well?

Anyway, if you like brainless entertainment and gore, there's a pretty good chance that you'll like it, but if you need originality, good characters, good acting, etc... You'll probably hate it.

2869499,3,B000RMJ4EE,"""Automaton Transfusion"" is a mess, bottom line. But this type of film isn't meant to be high-quality, or even thought-provoking. It is simply a splatterfest. But fans of this type of film will enjoy, however perversely, the non-stop gross-out throughout the entire thing. It's as nasty as Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" only without the humor. And make no mistake, ""Dead Alive"" is a very black comedy.

One thing that works against this offering is the choppy camera work. The cameras are obviously low grade pieces of equipment, as is the film stock. Watching this is like having way too much to drink, and then trying to focus as you walk home. Anyone who has ever overdone it with the bottle will identify with this; even if you like this kind of movie, the constant jarring of the visuals is an extremely uncomfortable experience. Maybe it is intentional, but it really is to this film's detriment. But as I have said, the fan base of this type of film is of the mindset where low quality film, bad acting, and thin plots are secondary. It's about the on-screen carnage. And boy, does it have a lot of it! And this alone makes it a surreal experience.

But the real self-administered slap in the face this movie goes through, is the ending; it has no ending. I made myself sit through this, just to have it stop, the screen goes blank, and a caption says ""To be continued."" If it has a follow-up, it would have been worthwhile to indicate on the box that it is a first part. In its present context, it seems they just ran out of money and/or time, and simply hung it up.

Many reviewers on Amazon have panned this movie, understandably, but they seem to have expected more out of it. Just expect to see some of the most gratuitous, visually shocking scenes in any movie; don't read anything into it, and don't expect Romero's calibre, and see just how far a low-budget film can go over the edge.

In all candor, these types of movies don't do much for me, not any more, anyway, but I sat through it out of morbid curiousity, what with the caption on the label that says ""...The best zombie film in decades..."" This is probably a reference to George Romero's ""Living Dead"" series, which is obviously the template against which these movies are compared, but there is no comparison. The scenes of violence and evisceration do go beyond the former's scope, but the movie is patently inferior.",1257984000,2,2392,4.581775700934579

This movie has surprisingly very little in common with the films of George Romero, which include compelling themes and interesting characters.

I could have overlooked the bad acting if the film had been as zombie-violence heavy as I was lead to believe it would be, but for some ungodly reason much of the movie focuses on a nonsensical plot that seems to have been written as the movie was literally being filmed, and the movie, and its viewers, suffer because of which.

One star only because it delivers on the violence, gore, zombies and chainsaws, more but mostly less.  Expect nothing else, or you may end up like me at the end of the film: asleep.",1256342400,,819,4.699300699300699

2869503,2,B000RMJ4EE,"""One of the best zombie films in decades""...  ... ""The Holy Grail of true independent horror films""...

These are the notations on the DVD cover.  Excuse me if I think ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Evil Dead"" still stand on the altar of independent horror icons.  In fact, ""Automaton Transfusion"" has none of the endearing qualities that make independent horror so compelling; original story, new twist, a surprise or two and perhaps a little hint of ""off-beat"".  I'm actually challenged to think of anything NOT derivative about this film.  That said; if you've never seen a zombie horror film then perhaps some of this film's qualities might work for you.  For the zombie veterans, you'll know where I'm coming from.  Let me dismember this film so that I'm clear.

-SHAMEFUL LACK OF AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT
How's that for hacking into the jugular?  See if any of this sounds familiar to you;

-Government experiment to keep dead soldiers fighting goes awry.
-Kill by head shots and infection by bites and scratches.
-Dead eat the living.
-The zombies can run fast.
-Use of a chainsaw to fight zombies.

I would bet you're familiar with about a dozen films that contain these ideas.  I'm actually ok with that.  George Romero's Zombie rules have been used pretty much as standard guidelines for decades.  Fast zombies have been a trend for about the last 10 years or so.  Chainsaws have become a standard horror convention.  All of these ideas appear in plenty of good to excellent horror films.  The problem here is that those films added some sort of new twist to the genre or were wildly entertaining.  ""So what's the big deal"" you might say.

-WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
Empathize with the film makers of ""Automaton Transfusion"" for a moment.  Imagine that you've spent months, perhaps years, scraping together money so that you can put your blood and sweat into your labor of love; an independent horror film.  You gather a rather large cast of unknown but competent actors.  You actually have a large enough budget to pull off decent gore.  You've scored some nice locations and have a clue about film making.  At this point I say ""good for you Steven, Bill and Mark.  But why the heck did you waste your time with this derivative, unimaginative story!?"".  There is nothing about this film that makes me standup and take notice.  I've seen it all before with the only difference being that I saw it in better films.

-VISUALLY SPEAKING
I found this film annoying to watch.  I don't know what technique was used but, whatever it was, it was over used.  I've noticed this technique in other films, usually used during action sequences to increase the sense of confusion.  You might know the look; intense contrast with a strange and jerky frame rate so that everything looks like it's moving in a frenetic and confusing way, sort of a low quality video look.  This film uses this technique throughout which just got irritating.  At least there is a good effort put into the gore which did at least add some intensity.  In case you were wondering, there is not enough sex or nudity to even mention it.

-THE DVD
In addition to those totally misleading quotes on the cover there is a totally misleading image of a half zombie crawling around (which would have been a step up from anything else they did in this film) however it never happened.  The ""Transfusion"" part of the title doesn't make any sense either.  Besides my qualms with the packaging this is a decent DVD.  Included are deleted scenes, a rather rough ""making of"", some music videos, commentary track and a short film that was made in 48 hours for a film festival that lead to this film getting made.  The short film was actually more intriguing than ""Automaton Transfusion"".

-TRANSFUSION CONCLUSION
If you've never seen a zombie film then this will seem really intense for you.  However, if you've seen ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Return of the Living Dead"" or just about any other zombie film then this is a waste of time.  You won't get anything really new out of it and the story has nothing going on that will grab you as new or especially entertaining.  As a mild spoiler I will tell you that the ending is a ""to be continued"" which is just ludicrous since so few will commit to actually watching a sequel to a bad film.  In a vacuum it might have merit despite the annoying visual style.  However, we tend to watch movies in rooms filled with air.

everyone that gets eaten is chewy
the illustrate how barren the city is by not showing empty streets..but the tops of huge office buildings in the city from a down ward angle. if you're already on the street level shouldn't you see street level things?!?!??!
cameras look like it was filmed on a web cam; it's always moving faster than it should, and choppy too.
the sound is all animal sounds dubbed over
the dubbing is off so bad that i thought it was foreign and i had to change the sound options
where can i get a shot gun that shoots people in the face with red paint???
the guy on the cover is not in the movie.. the two best and only good parts are:
beginning guy gets folded wrong way in two and pulled into a wall frozen dead people holder (cant think of the name)
and
girl getting bottom jaw ripped off, although looked like a wierd sped up green screen/cg combo thing; and with the guy and the death freezer, his legs looked awful flat, like nothing in the pant leg flat.

The ending will just piss you off if you can call it an ending and if they're hoping for a sequel I'd stay away from it unless you just like wasting money and time watching poorly acted, filmed, directed and written films.",1244937600,,587,4.4953271028037385
2869512,1,B000RMJ4EE,"I know the movie was done on an incredibly low budget and a tight schedule, but that doesn't forgive the movie for being completely and utterly devoid of merit or redeeming qualities. The camerawork is damn near unwatchable, the acting is beyond amateur, and the plot... damn it there is none. There is nothing unique, interesting, or even coherent about it. It really feels like they were making it up as they went along. There isn't even an ending, just a sudden ""To Be Continued"" once the movie has reached what could be considered a feature-length, leaving every plot thread (including completely unexplained new situations introduced literally a minute before the movie is over) unresolved. The whole movie is a set-up for a sequel I sincerely doubt will ever get made.

So basically, if you want an unprofessional, unoriginal, no-budget, over-extended first act to a story that likely will never be finished, than I can recommend it. Otherwise, go and grab one of the million other zombie movies that have been made, its unlikely any of them are anywhere near as bad as this.",1242345600,2,1081,4.875
2869513,1,B000RMJ4EE,"The best word I have to describe this movie is ""benign.""

The most obvious problem with this film is the photography.  The feature seems like it was filmed with cheap mobile phones.  The frame rate is so low that the choppiness of the film makes it very difficult to keep your focus on the movie.  And far too many shots are blurry.  The acting is so bad that it leads you to believe that casting was of minimal concern to the filmmakers.  There's almost no story to the film, no creepiness and no scary or startling moments.  Even when a scene should have had a startling moment (zombie jumping out from the dark), the filming was not done in a way to lead you up to the scary moment, so it just isn't startling at all.

I can almost always recommend a zombie film to someone, even if it's ultra low-budget with bad acting (often that makes it better), but this film was so pointless and, ultimately, so benign that I cannot recommend it to anyone.",1241308800,2,949,4.3522727272727275

I really felt I needed to warn the unsuspecting zombie fans.  If the bad acting, lack of anything near a plot, and poor filming isn't bad enough, they had the nerve to end it with ""TO BE CONTINUED"".  To be continued???  Are they out of their minds?  I just subjected myself to 75 minutes of one of the worst films ever made--and I actually paid money for it!  Do they really think people will waste more of their precious life to see more of this?  In my opinion, they didn't know how to end it, so they put a ""to be continued"" as the ending.  What do they care?  They already got our money.  Please, avoid this trash at all costs.  It's 75 minutes of your life you'll never get back.  Root canal would be less painful.  Consider yourself warned!",1241308800,6,1053,4.242424242424242

The first thing i realized about the movie is how sketchy the quality it is. I've seen shaky camerawork (example: the Bourne trilogy) but this felt like i was watching a youtube video on an extremely slow computer. The second thing I noticed was this horribly animated smoke that just got annoying. This was all 30 seconds into the movie. Why did i give this 4 stars? Well, the third thing I noticed was how AWESOMELY GORY this movie is! It's wonderfully executed too. It's quite apparent that they spent most of the budget on gore effects.

The reason this is such a guilty pleasure for me is because i was able to look past all of it's low budget flaws just for the gore. Seriously, the first gory part is maybe a minute or two in and it doesn't let up until the ending credits.

The bottom line is that yes, it's a very low budget film... if i'm correct it was made for no more than $30,000. But the underlying truth is that it's a nonstop gorefest. Zombie film lovers should definately give it a shot.",1239148800,,1231,4.297413793103448
2869517,3,B000RMJ4EE,"I have to say that this isn't the best zombie movie I've ever seen.  However it isn't that horrible, honestly it really isn't.

This movie is also super low budget and the acting is about as good as a stale potato chip. The reason I enjoyed this movie is because it is what it is and it doesn't pretend to be anything it is not.  In other words, it is a gory zombie movie.  There is tons of blood, screaming, killing and violence.  There is a scene where a fetus is ripped out by a zombie, then eaten.  How is insane is that?  The zombies in this movie are also the ""fast"" type.  I also found the origin of the zombies to be rather satisfying. This movie is short and sweet (lasting only 75 minutes long).  In addition to the movie being short, the action starts rather quickly and keeps the action going.

Some of the cons, the characters are rather weak and I didn't really care about any of them.  I also felt like a panty hose was over the camera lens entire movie, there is this fuzz and/or lack of focus through out the whole movie.  Perhaps a diffuser filter was used to promote a hazy feel, if this is the case I am befuddled why it was done.  The title of the movie makes no sense at all to me.  In addition the ending is a bit abrupt and somewhat comical.

Again a very ""low budget"" movie that was filmed in parts of Florida (that were all too familiar to me).  For new zombie fans I wouldn't suggest watching this movie first, because there are many better zombie flicks out there,  however this movie is short, sweet, gory little horror movie that isn't a horrible way to pass 75 minutes.",1239148800,,2134,5.2082111436950145

BAD SCREENWRITING - Here they take the formula (one guy sick guy bites another and the whole city turns into zombies and four guys try to stay alive) and make nothing with it. Bad dialogue, ridiculous situations, idiotic turns. Clearly, the screenwriter did not care to give us anything interesting.

BAD ACTING - Horrible actors who cannot deliver a line. They never look or sound convincing. It is all laughable at best. Or irritating.

BAD DIRECTING - Clearly the work of an amateur. This director does not know what to do with his camera. The camera setups are poorly designed and the camera is always shaking - needlessly.

BAD CINEMATOGRAPHY - Unimaginative work at best.

BAD SOUND - Some dialogs are hard to understand. The music is awful.

BAD EFFECTS - Except for the girl whose jaw is broken, everything here is mediocre. Far below average.

2869526,1,B000RMJ4EE,"Kudos to the filmmakers of Automation Transfusion, Kudos. The effects are amazing. Maybe I should just be giving kudos to the sfx team. But again, the effects for such a low budget film are great. A little more could have been done with the looks of the zombies aside from some splashes of blood and the pasty face / sunken eyes, but the gore effects were pretty effective. The blood flows just as it should in a zombie film that ... really can't be taken ... seriously. Even if ... you're not sure if you're supposed to take the film seriously. Or not?

 I comment a lot on the effects because aside from that, Automation Transfusion has absolutely nothing else going for it.  You care not for the characters. You care if their demise is going to be bloody and better than the previous. You care not that one of the center characters randomly decides to ""heroicly"" sacrifice themselves because they are just idioticly doing it anyway. You can not if that woman's b....I won't even spoil this because this is the ""shocker"" of the film, but is so far out there and was so unnecessary and could never be taken seriously that it should just be seen.

 Really, there is nothing much to this movie aside from the effects. The story that was attempted just didn't work. Why explain that there are zombies running (the new millenium zombies, the literally running ones) around with a poor motive?

The movie was EXACTLY what I was expecting, and it certainly held its own in the way of brutal violence, with a dash of hilarity. Yes, the story defined everything that is lack-luster, and yes, there were more than a few scenes where you could see that a ready set assistant had splattered corn syrup on a bed sheet, or wall. However, the movie started and ended with a pure adrenaline rush, and did everything that it could to keep the viewer sitting on the edge of their seat (or in my case, the bed). With plenty of one-liners, and homages toward classic zombie flicks, as well as purely violent moments, the movie never slowed down, once the infection had been revealed.

The wonderful thing about the film is that, it never gives away a set location or identity to an area, leaving the viewer to believe that it could really be based anywhere. The concept of having high school kids fighting for survival is unique, although it DOES have moments where it becomes a pale reminder of movies such as Dawn of the Dead, or any other film taking place in a large, set location.

All in all, Automation Transfusion could have been a lot greater as a blockbuster film with a stronger cast, but for a limited budget and a young cast, you can't go wrong.",1219104000,,1411,4.5078125

Okay, first off, what's with all the screaming? I'd like to think that we're past that. It's just not realistic. Why would anyone in their right mind scream over and over instead of shutting the hell up when trying to hide from a horde of flesh-eating zombies? Here, both the men and women scream and scream and scream(either from fear or frustration). So, you're hiding under the table and there're zombies in the room, you shut the hell up and don't make any kind of noise, not sniffing so loud a sleeping baby the next room over can hear you.

It's just a movie. You can't expect it to be 100% realistic. I know, I know. But it has to at least resemble real life. You know...just a little.",1212278400,,902,4.460606060606061

On my HDTV being played through a HD DVD upconverter, it shows up as a smaller widescreen box on my screen. When switching between the other three DVD players I have, nothing changed....

Now as far as the movie is concerned, it was good for what it was, a zombie splatter bloodbath. It wasn't nearly as bad as most of the reviews on here, however the ending did kinda suck (I won't give it away, you can see for yourself). I would have rated this movie between a 3-1/2 and 4 stars but I docked it a point for not being an enhanced presentation...

2869545,2,B000RMJ4EE,"I know, I know, this is low-budget zombie cinema so why harp on the use of ideas that have been used and re-used hundreds of times before?  In fact, why watch these type of films in the first place if you're going to be overly critical right?  True, that's a good couple of points except... at one time, independent horror films weren't only awesome BUT also original and scary.  I suppose every time I pick up one of these movies I hope to find something different or special... oh well, maybe next time huh?  Automaton Transfusion is one of the newest(seems like there's at least 3 more every Tuesday release day) independent attempts at the zombie genre.  Sporting the controversial(to me at least) ""running dead"" approach and a filming style that could make for Epileptic seizures at worst and mild nausea at best, Automaton Transfusion features a military experiment gone awry(shocking!) and a town overrun by the infected for our protagonists to escape from.  As I said at the top, pretty basic stuff, with our leads being an even more basic mish-mash of high school types(i.e. cheerleader, outcast, overweight loser, lone black guy in entire town, etc.) that you've seen plenty of times before.  The gore runs from good, to at times even inspired(a torn off lower jaw still has me wondering how it was done so well?) but is so overly absurd that it's never really gross, but it's still entertaining(by the way, the scene on the cover unfortunately never occurs).  The acting... is to be expected for this type of picture, not always bad, but never really good either(probably a little better than most of it's kind though).  The zombies actually come off much more like the infected from the 28 Days Later franchise, mostly just regular looking people, except covered in blood and running around biting the living.  The pluses about the film are that it hits the ground running(pun intended) and doesn't bore us with too much buildup and other unnecessary drama(it knows what it is), basically just running from one undead attack into another(in a nicely scant 75 minute package), and the scene where a zombie rips an unborn baby from a mothers stomach and devours it in front of her(I'm a horror fan... what do you want me to say?  Loved it!).  I had high expectations for this and maybe that's why I'm so hard on it upon my initial viewing(but maybe not either)?  For fans of newer low-budget and independent zombie cinema this should provide enough goods to entertain, but still is probably only worth a rental first.  *SPOILER ALERT*  I never give away spoilers in reviews but this one is big enough that I figure I should(not to mention I kinda wish I knew about it before buying)... the movie ends with a ""To Be Continued.""

What was really disapointing is the plot could have work. A agent to reanimate the dead so that they are fast and some what smart as a weapon is a cool story. They would feast on their enemies and not have to use soliders is not a bad script. Then to test it on some small town is great but that is where it begins and end.

2869553,3,B000RMJ4EE,"Fast and furious zombie fun!!

1) ACTING: The acting in this zombie opus was pretty good. While the viewer is forced to deal with the usual stereotypical characters, (the cool dude, the dork, the hot chick, etc.) the actors, for the most part, made their respective characters pretty realistic. However, I must mention that I thought a number of the actors looked a little long in the tooth to be playing high school kids.

2) PRODUCTION: I think this is where there will be a lot of dissention between viewers. The blood and gore is plentful, and the action is fast and furious. The movie is filmed with a grainy film resolution, which combined with the jerky, fast moving camera movements and angles, made more that one scene difficult to see. The jerky, hand held camera movements did not bother me to the point of nausea, but I did occassionally wish for a NON shakey moment, just so I could focus my eyes. The zombie make up was minimal and looked more like individuals running around covered in blood. I appreciated all the homages to other movies that I noticed. It IS a zombie movie people, and a lot of zombie movies have already been done, so the chances of seeing something that we've already seen is pretty high. My biggest disappointment was the ending. The surviving heroes are on the run, they hit a dead end, (no pun intended) and...fade to black appears with ""To be continued..."" WHAT?!?!? If this was a tv show when next week I would be seeing the next part, or if the sequel to 'Automaton Transfusion' was already sitting in the can, waiting to be released in a month...okay. But to have an indie movie end like this when there may be no definite sequel in sight is a terrible way to end.

3) ZOMBIES: Nothing really new here is brought to the genre, just more of the shamblers and runners that we've come to love.

4) THE CAUSE: Military experiment gone awry...sigh

5) NUDITY: A few breasts appear.

FINAL:
I enjoyed this movie. I have heard and read a lot of reviews where you either hate it, or love it. While I didn't ""love"" it, I did think it was a fun visit to the zombie genre. When you realize that the director made this movie for such a low amount of money, you have to give props where props are due. Hopefully, there will be a sequel to this movie, so that we can find out what happened to the survivors, and maybe some Hollywood types will give the director some ample cash for a serious budget.

One indication that the money ran out is that the movie only lasted about and hour and twelve minutes, instead of the standare hour and  twenty-five to thirty minutes. The zombies were kind of too human like. There were some parts that served no purpose other than to entertain those gore fans like when the zombie did what he did to the pregnant girl. The formulaic star corssed young lovers was good. There were too many questions left unaswered though. What happens to the two soldiers in the school? What good would getting the syrum do if the zombies ate a whole in your neck? Did the young couple survive?  Why didn't the producers get a loan to finish the film.

2869557,1,B000RMJ4EE,"This ""movie""--and I use that term very loosely--is so bad that it almost defies description.  Supposedly released in 2006 (and now just making it to video), this gargantuan barf-fest is another shining example of why NO ONE takes horror seriously.

The premise is--and this may be stretching it--a bunch of high school kids decide to have a party (out in the middle of nowhere), but before they get there, most everyone else in their town has turned into ZOMBIES!  The zombies of the ""cheap makeup/no makeup and very bad acting"" kind, natch.  But these just aren't your typical zombies; oh no, they can run and think, which is more than the producer/director of this movie could.  Oh, I think they could run.  And I'm pretty sure they could think, but ne'er the twain did meet.

After arriving/leaving the slaughterhouse (formerly known as the party), the few survivors dash to the local high school (first place I'd go in this kind of emergency), only to find that no one seems to lock the high school doors and night and zombies DO need a place to rest...  The two survivors (oh, did I spoil something?) come upon two soliders--cleverly disguised as maintenance men--and are told about a horrible defense experiment which went horribly awry (don't they all?).  BUT, survivor A's father has an antidote and he and his girlfriend are going to get it, even if they have to do it by themselves.

After they go out apparently the ONLY LOCKING DOOR IN THE SCHOOL, they are surrounded by zombies, and you then get a ""to be continued"" ending.  Honey, this ain't ""Grindhouse.""

Horribly directed by Steven C. Miller, horrible camera work (he should have told someone to edit out the camerman's breathing), horrible makeup and effects, there really is no reason to make this trash.  All it does is drive another nail in the coffin of horror movies.  Running time is 75 minutes, but you'll swear you've been there a day.

2869559,3,B000RMJ4EE,"As far as independent zombie flicks go, this one is waaay above par.
But considering the multitude of unwatchable ones....that's not saying much
What made this particular film painfully frustrating, was its potential to be excellent.
The gore was remarkable!! Especially for a no-budget zombie flick!!
(There are 2 gorrific scenes that are off the charts.)
And with any number of nods toward it's influences. (Fulci, Romero, etc.) it should have been the next great independent zombie flick.
But.... cardboard characters and and a stale script
effectively killed any sort of tension the movie should have had.
There was no sense of dread, panic, or hopeless despair.
Which is really peculiar
considering how vicious the zombies in this flick were supposed to be.
In fact, the undead didn't look undead at all!
More like people just running around covered in blood.
The story (or lack there of)
takes a turn for the retarded about 10 minutes before the conclusion,
And the cliffhanger ""To Be Continued"" ending,
was the most insulting cop-out in recent memory.
Especially when you consider the 75 minute runtime!!
This mountain of shortcomings essentially nullified all the excelllent gore scenes, the films only saving grace.
The final nail in this flicks cinematic coffin was the terribly epileptic camerawork,
which I'm certain was done to make the film appear like it had a higher budget than it actually did.
It was almost like the shutter speed was slowed down, so everything appeared to be unbearably spastic.
(This technique would have been more effective if it was reserved specifically for moments of tension, and not used for the entire film.)
In all honesty, it initially made my eyes hurt.
So much, I considered shutting it off 3 minutes in.
And as unbelievable as it sounds, the cinematography actually had me & my wife sick to our stomachs. (And we sat through Tetsuo!!!!)

The movie was shot in Orlando on a $30,000 budget, which is impressive. It doesn't really look bad. Scenes are staged professional, shifts in character are seamless ... the mechanical aspects of the movie are pretty good, considering it was made by a bunch of amateurs on a shoestring budget. My one gripe was with the camera itself, which seemed to buffer the image from time to time. The story itself suffered. It brought nothing new to the zombie millieu, relying instead on cliched characters, settings, and plot developments. The soundtrack was way too loud. But sin of sins - it ended with a cliffhanger and a ""To be continued."" And when you look for ""Transfusion 2"" you find it's ""in development."" That was nine years ago. I would have given this movie three stars on the basis of its development on such a flimsy budget, but in my book ending a story with no promise of a followup any time soon is unforgiveable.

But when it comes to AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION, I kept seeing the movie everywhere, with that blurb on the front from Bloody Disgusting.com calling it ""One of the best zombie films in decades.""

Of course, if I'd been thinking clearly, I would have remembered that other than the Snyder movie, there haven't been any good zombie movies in decades, so being one of the best of nothing shouldn't have been too hard anyway.  Well, I found a used copy for about $5, so I finally broke down and just bought the thing.

Including the DVD's commentary track, I've now sat through this movie twice, all 75 minutes of it (that's 2  hours of my life), and I'm not sure that $5 was worth it.

The story is typical.  Life starts on a normal day, and all of the sudden, without warning or provocation, there are zombies tearing up everything and everyone in their path.  AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION could simply be a ""meanwhile"" to any other zombie movie, and in the end this movie meets another movie for one big massive lame zombie movie.

Our story deals with a group of high school kids in Florida.  Chris (Garrett Jones, PENANCE) is our male lead, a stoner rock guy with a cheerleader girlfriend, Jackie (Juliet Reeves, ""Treme"").  On this particular day, Jackie is headed to a party out in the woods while Chris and his buddies, Scott (William Howard Bowman, DEAR JOHN) and Tim (Rowan Bousaid, JUMPING UP AND DOWN), are headed to another town 50 miles away to see a band play at a bar.  On the drive, Chris mentions they've been on the road nearly an hour and haven't seen any cars moving either direction the entire time.  When they get to the town, they see why.  Or at least, they see more of the same.  The place looks deserted.

They get out of the car, wondering where everyone is, when suddenly a tide of zombies rounds a corner and comes after them.  Instead of getting back into the car they're still standing right next to, they run across the parking lot and into the bar.

Meanwhile, back at the party, Jackie is having a crappy time.

Back at the bar, Chris, Tim and Scott find the bartender is still alive.  They wait around a while, not sure what to do, then the three friends decide they have to get back to the car, which they should have just gotten back into right away anyway, but whatever.  The bartender covers them with his shotgun, finally sacrificing himself so they can escape, and the first place they head is back to Chris's house, only to discover Chris's father is dead.  So they go to the party in the woods instead, where they find the zombies have already devoured everyone in the area--except Jackie, whom Chris saves and the group of four wind up in what looks like a garage full of potential weapons, including a baseball bat, an ax, a shotgun and a chainsaw.  They rush out to face the zombie hordes.

Tim gets picked up in a car driven by one of the cheerleaders he has a crush on, Simone (Ashley Elizabeth Pierce, THE GAINESVILLE RIPPER) but they don't get far before running into a tree, throwing both occupants down a ravine and into a lake, where they're attacked by a zombie who does a kid-Jason Vorhees on them.  Tim's legs get eaten off and Simone escapes without him.  She meets up with Chris, Jackie and Scott back at their high school which Christ insists, for some reason, must surely have survivors.  Considering school got out early that day when one of the students attacked and bit a teacher, I'm not sure why there should be survivors at the school, unless there were a lot of after school clubs that had meetings that night.

What they find, however, is a gymnasium littered with dead bodies, which turn out not to be quite dead enough.  Scott is tired of running, so he powers up his chainsaw and heads into the zombie tide while the other three run away.  Simone is next to die and things look grim for Chris and Jackie, but they're rescued by an army officer who takes them to a military bunker under the school where their janitor, who is really another army officer, lives.

Wait, what?

Yeah, that was pretty much my attitude about this entire movie.  Do WHA???

Listening to the director and producer commentary, it's clear they weren't setting out to make a great movie, they just wanted something with lots of action.  They even criticize movies with too much useless dialogue, claiming the script for this movie, at a read-through, only ran about 26 minutes.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, they sacrificed a TON of story by eliminating so much dialogue.  I mean there are things in this movie that make no sense at all, like if it took so long to get to the bar in the first place, how the hell'd they get back to town so quick?

How come, when they get Jackie from the party--which they drove to in Chris's dad's car--they leave again on foot?  And how come Tim was the only one to get in the car with the cheerleader, when everyone was escaping together?

The holes in this movie's plot could fit the Death Star.

Writer/director Steven C. Miller (SILENT NIGHT) admits in the commentary to not being a very good writer, and at least he's honest about it.  The dialogue was ridiculous and this was very obviously the first movie this cast had starred in.  I'm sure they're all really nice guys, but actors . . . Umm . . .

My biggest gripe with this movie wasn't the script, plot or even the acting.  It was the camera work.  Miller says it was a conscious choice to use a lot of shaky cam because in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, a person's emotional state isn't going to be calm, but erratic and frantic, as expressed by the shaky camera work.  I disagree.  I mean, obviously in that situation emotions are going to run high and your mind is going to be reeling, I admit that.  But I don't think the shaky cam was necessary in conveying that to the audience.  The action onscreen by the actors was enough to get that across, and that should have sufficed.  All the shaky camera work did, for me, was keep tossing me out of the movie while I thought about what a terrible choice the shaky cam was.

The one things this movie had going in its favor were the effects.  While the budget didn't allow for a lot of really spectacular special effects, they made great use of what they had to work with, providing a dozen or more moments of awesome gore.  From a jaw being ripped off to several heads exploding and a fetus being ripped from a pregnant high school girl's stomach.  I'm not saying the effects were classy, but they were very well-done.

I tried really hard to like AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION despite its subject matter.  I'm all for being proven wrong when it comes to the things I don't like very much.  I'm dying to find a really awesome zombie movie that proves to me this subgenre has any worth whatsoever.  And even though I said I liked DAWN OF THE DEAD, let's be honest; that could have been anything coming after those people in that mall, aliens, killer animals.  The success of that movie did not depend on the zombies, it was just a well-made movie in general, with great direction, acting and writing.  The zombies in that movie, as far as I'm concerned, were inconsequential.

What I'm looking for is a great zombie movie where the zombies are just as vital a part of the story as anything else, something original where the entire point of the movie isn't just going in search of the girlfriend or kid that was left behind or spending the entire time moving from one location to the next in a desperate attempt to find shelter.  I had hoped this might be that movie.  The back of the DVD case claims this one ""shockingly redefines the zombie genre.""  Well, no, it doesn't.  A lame backstory and amped up gore does not redefine a genre.  I applaud the effort, but this isn't one I'll be revisiting any time soon.",1364688000,,8213,4.454119223040857
8201379,1,B000RMJ4EE,"I'm a zombie fan. Nay, a zombie connaisseur. And as far as horror movies go, if it's got a good premise, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  One reviewer on here hit it right on the head: can't judge a book by it's cover.  If you could, this would be the greatest zombie movie ever made.  But I assure you, the cover is the best looking thing about it.

The whole movie looks like it was filmed on a Hi8, which sometimes I'm ok with if it's got a good script and acting.  This fell short on both counts.  Superb low-budget indie horror like ""Colin"" and ""Absentia"" may have ruined some movies for me because they set the bar pretty high, but there's never a reason to overlook the necessities of a genre.  If you are zombie fan, and you do watch this movie, you'll note 2 specific deaths that are completely out-of-whack with how any self-respecting zombie horde would operate (I won't go into grisly, spoiler-filled details here though).

Lastly, they put 'to be continued...' at the end. No thanks.",1355270400,,1003,4.442622950819672
