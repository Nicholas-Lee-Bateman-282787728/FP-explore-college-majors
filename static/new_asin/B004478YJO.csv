I'm thinking they have no sense of humor at all; Not really going to light into these type of hacks that can ""yay"" or ""nay"" a new show but couldn't they have at least watched the episodes? There is just no way that they gave it an honest look.  A real shame that such a clever and funny show was passed over for a lame show like ""Outsourced"" for example. I'm betting these same brainless wonders were the same ones to say ""Nope"" to ""Firefly""  Where can I get that job checking out the new promising shows?",1304640000,,606,4.162393162393163
8415964,5,B004478YJO,"This has got to be one of the funniest comidies that has ever shown on any tv network. Throught the season you will never find the time to breath because you will be laughing to hard. All the way from ""the yanky bitch"" to leslies  obession with a pair of boots, you will find yourself in love with each charactor and the show.",1293494400,,326,4.174603174603175
