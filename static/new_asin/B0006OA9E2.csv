8041948,4,B0006OA9E2,"An essential archive with Kenton, Les Brown, Charlie Barnet and June Christie but unfortunately, no Dizzy!",1179705600,2,106,5.6875
8041949,3,B0006OA9E2,"I didn't realize that these were various films instead of a concert. However, I was pleased with this 40's material containing tracks from Charlie Barnet and Les Brown also.

Hard to come by material this old.",1173312000,4,209,4.805555555555555
