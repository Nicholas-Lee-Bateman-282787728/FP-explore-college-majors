3916655,5,B002EBCE98,"Hope, friendship, adventure, love, forgiveness, compassion, Paradise, all words that leave a subtle nostalgia upon watching Wolf's Rain; mere words cannot hope to come close to truly describing this anime. When I first saw a Wolf's Rain poster it seemed like an 'interesting' show to watch; but as I watched the first episode, then the second, then the third, and fourth, and fifth, then beyond, my initial impression of 'interesting' was drastically changed. From the first moment when you hear one of our main protagonists, Kiba, narrate the opening scene and hear the beautiful musical score behind the voice, it makes you feel as if you personally know the characters and you feel all the human emotions and struggles they go through their journey. In Wolf's Rain, Kiba is trying to find Paradise, a place that only wolves can open. However wolves were hunted down by humans and had extinct for over 200 years....needless to say being a wolf isn't exactly an option. So wolves adapted to human form and walked among humans. Upon reaching the city, Kiba tries to find the flower maiden named Cheza who can lead the wolves to Paradise. Little did Kiba know that in the city he would find more than a scent of the flower maiden; here he would find Hige, a wolf with a carefree spirit, Tsume, also a wolf with a bad-boy attitude that seems to have a haunted past, and Toboe, the youngest in the group who's sweet naive innocent ties them, and together these unlikely personalities come to form an unbreakable tie as progress on their journey to find Paradise. Their antagonists are Darcia, a man haunted by a curse and the loss of his beloved Hamona, and Quent who is a drunk, broken man convinced wolves took his happiness and family away. Yet while as antagonists their characters are very excellently developed, and while their actions are terrible and inexcusable at times, you understand them unlike other series where the explanation towards the villain or antagonist is brief or they are just so.

A great attribution about Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe, that while having different personalities and characters, all possess human emotions and through their journey, help heal each other and relive them of their burdens and sadness that they all carried. This, for lack of a better world, 'anime' gives a hope that while we might not find Paradise on earth, it shouldn't stop us from looking. You never know since along the way you might find unlikely people who show you what true friendship is. Then we can can all know the true meaning of Wolf's Rain is.",1309824000,2,2564,4.800904977375565

8367427,3,B002EBCE98,"This is definitely bootlegged, but at least it has the show in decent quality. However, they did also include a copy of Vampire Hunter D so all is forgiven.",1461628800,,156,4.413793103448276
8367428,1,B002EBCE98,"This is a fake. It is not any form of officially sold Wolf's Rain DVD sets (and contrary to what the seller tried convincing me, it is not some lesser known set not sold in the USA). In fact the art work on the front cover is from one of the real individually sold sets, and the back cover claims itself to be from a whole other set (a much larger in size one at that). There are no special features or such on the DVDs, they merely contain a list of the episodes on them which were ripped from the officially licensed sets.

Honestly if you're looking at getting the Wolf's Rain series and don't care about official sets or video quality, then you would be better off just going to Pirate Bay, or something like that, to find and download the same ripped content for free.",1461542400,,773,4.222972972972973

maybe go ahead and pay for the privilege and buy one of he other editions.",1455148800,,412,4.394736842105263
8367431,5,B002EBCE98,"For a Sci Fi / action / drama it is an Excellent series. I found the several plot layers very enjoyable. Though some may not care for the ending which does leave one wondering what may come next.  For clarification.  This is not a 'bootleg' but an ""import set"".  That meaning that while it is basically the same as a region one in it's presentation, audio, video, subtitles and dubbing, the compression ratio is higher than in a region one set.  (3 disks as opposed to 7 in the original release)  That being said I found the audio, video and subtitles to be very well done and plays great on a regular DVD player.  No Issues.  It is Great value compared to what is now available.",1452816000,3,679,4.341269841269841
