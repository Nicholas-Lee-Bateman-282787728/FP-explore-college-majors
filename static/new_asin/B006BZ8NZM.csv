4982638,2,B006BZ8NZM,"I expected a campy retro type of film from the title and write up. Instead I just got a bad film with a lot of promise and potential. The shark special effects was Asylum grade, and to be honest, I expected that. The science was horrific bad, although not the worse aspect. By far and away the whole drama surrounding the film was terrible. The dialouge was not entertaining. It was very plain and dry. The film also spends a lot of time introducing characters, building them up, just to turn them into food. All the women in the movie wear a bikini, which was perhaps the only real appeal of the film.

The shark itself was comical as it maneuvers on land. But by that point you just want the film to be over. Sarah Lieving who played an investigating agent in ""Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus"" did it so well she landed the same role for this film. She looks good in a bikini, too bad they didn't write her any decent lines. Produced, directed and written by Fred Olen Ray who did ""Bikini Time Machine"", ""Bikini Frankenstein"", ""Bikini Royale"", ""Bikini Royale 2,"" ""Bikini Jones and the Temple of Eros,"" ""Super Ninja Bikini Babes,"" ""Bikini Chain Gang,"" ""Bikini Drive-In"", ""Bikini Hoe-Down"", ""Bikini Round-Up"", and I think you get the picture.

Asylum grade entertainment at best.

the standard) but the shark is really big & the film is lots of fun.  The c.g. could be better, but lower-budget sharks usually suffer
from noticible overlay/pixel errors.  That's what divides the really scary sharks from the not-so-scary ones.  I love films that really
frighten me, but the fun-scary kind are good too.  So, bring on Supershark & his friends, & pass the popcorn.",1397174400,,511,4.816091954022989

I figured what the neck and watched the trailer, it was pathetic. Sharks can jump out of water, but not high enough to be considered flying. And all the bikini chicks it's kinda stereotypical for a beach staged movie. The acting did look really bad and the shark being able to walk on land is just dumb. Along with the shark vs walking tank thing, that was stupid. The cgi was terrible, made me wanna throw up.",1390867200,,552,4.3173076923076925

4982734,2,B006BZ8NZM,"This film is as excrementally awful as the other reviews have led you to believe, a steaming pile of digital manure that plops out of your TV and pollutes everything it touches. It's redeemed by the fact that it's hilarious in every respect.  The acting is beyond abysmal.  The script makes anything George Lucas ever did look like a Pulitzer-winning novel by comparison.  The special effects are anything but.  There's so many continuity errors that I lost count.  And don't get me started on the science of it all.  Yet somehow, it charms its way into your funny bones and makes you laugh out loud, frequently.  I cheered every time the shark ate one of the whiny, annoying characters - especially the stick-thin, pasty ""lifeguard"" who cries ""I wish I were dead!"" and has her wish instantly granted by Super Shark.

This film is best enjoyed while fairly intoxicated and with company at the end of a bad day.  Dreadful, dreadful film - enjoy.",1381276800,,944,4.7073170731707314

4982771,5,B006BZ8NZM,"Michael Butt's review in March 2012 was right on. Cheesy is the best word to describe this movie.

I gave this movie 5 stars because it is a perfect bad shark movie: absurd plot, bad acting, incredulous script, bikini-clad babes running around, and cheesy special effects. So if you are looking for a movie that you can have lots of laughs because it is completely preposterous, then this is your movie. My nephews (teenagers) and I search for the most ridiculous movies that we can watch together late on a weekend night to laugh at. There are so many scenes that just make you roar with laughter, like when a girl in a bikini uses an umbrella to fight off the enormous shark that looks as big as a house instead of just running to high ground where the shark can't get her.

There are so many annoying characters in this movie that at times you are rooting for the shark to eat them, and he usually does. Jimmie Walker is very loud and annoying as the DJ, but he fits in well in this movie. He just can't say Dy-No-Mite enough times to satisfy himself.

This is the perfect movie to just sit at home with family on a lazy Saturday and have a few laughs because it is so absurd. My nephews and I just loved it. I highly recommend it to those looking for a really bad and incredulous shark movie. You will be entertained! If you are looking for a Jaws-type movie that has a morsel of realism to it, then this is not your movie.

Yes, this shark can jump out of the water and catch aircraft in the sky and can even use his flippers to chase people down on the beach. The movie even has a walking tank that has robotic legs that can kick a shark in the face. It just doesn't get better than this!

I highly recommend this movie if you are interested in absurd shark movies.",1350777600,2,1771,4.243323442136498
4982772,3,B006BZ8NZM,"It's okay if you don't expect a lot from this movie.  Computer generated creatures, fake blood, generic acting, but it keeps you occupied if you're bored silly",1349913600,,159,4.888888888888889
4982773,4,B006BZ8NZM,"Pretty fun movie, though owning it is something only a collector may want.  The CG is pretty poor, but there is plenty of action.  One thing that actually surprised me is that i cared for the lead actors.  I felt that there was some well thought and acted characters.  Sure there were plenty of shallow characters and shark bait, but the leads did their job well and i really connected with them rather than them being there simply to move the plot or fill between set pieces.",1347580800,,476,4.436781609195402
4982774,4,B006BZ8NZM,"I'm a sucker for cheesy, low budget, horrible acting and dialogue monster movies. Well, this is a perfect example! Personally I enjoyed the campiness, most people probably wouldn't. If you truly enjoy these types of movies, then grab a sixpack and get ready to laugh until the credits roll! It even has a really stupid theme song to match the really stupid movie! Lol",1344902400,3,367,4.75
4982775,2,B006BZ8NZM,"OK. First things first: I am giving this movie two stars solely for the presence of Jimmie ""J.J."" Walker as DJ Dynamite Stevens. More specifically I am giving it two stars for his impressive collection of hats, which range from a simple yellow fez, to a purple sombrero (which is paired nicely with Bootsy glasses,) to a simply sublime metallic green and gold metallic sack of some sort which makes him look more like a psychedelic bag of Jiffy Pop than anything. When you combine that with the fact that he says ""Dy-no-mite"" a lot, I couldn't face giving it a single star, which is what it otherwise richly deserves.

If you haven't seen many Fred Olen Ray movies, let me clue you in: they are filled with decorative bikinis (which is by far their best feature,) ludicrous special effects, terrible scripts, and lack of acting ability as a rule. This one does not disappoint if that is what you desire. Besides J.J., the only thing in the film worth watching is Rya Meyers as lifeguard Cali, the shy lifeguard in the one-piece who looks better than all the other women in the film combined, yet is inexplicably the one with self-confidence issues. The film starts with a rollicking theme song by R&B legend Harvey Scales (an extra of the hilarious music video is included) and a flashback device that utterly gives away the entire film. I don't understand that directorial choice, but believe me it's safe to stop watching there: you have seen the good part. I particularly liked the walking (and kicking) Army tank, and the associated CGI.

After the titles our time is split three ways: there's a deep sea oil rig that's pumping bad chemicals into the ocean and is subsequently devoured by a very large shark; there's a rogue government investigator on a mission of vengeance; and there's a bikini contest. Guess which one is most interesting? Surprisingly, it's not the bikini contest, because Cali didn't (deservedly) win, and there is much gratuitous footage of a very unappealingly endowed contestant. The investigator from the ""Oceanic Investigation Bureau"" is Dr. Kat Carmichael (Sarah Lieving,) a zealot who oversteps her bounds often and commits a felony repeatedly (impersonating a federal officer.) She is insufferably self-righteous and makes the movie's political statement clear when she says that sharks ""are just like oil companies: mindless eating machines."" After some painfully contrived backstory, she enlists the aid of ""Skipper Chuck"" (Tim Abell) a charter boat captain, to take her to where the oil rig was destroyed. She takes some water home in a thermos and presents it to oil company bad guy Roger Wade (John Schneider!) He is mesmerized with her ability to squeeze a lemon into the water and alter the reading on a pH strip toward the acidic end of the scale. She, of course knows this is due to the presence of potassium feldspar, which is actually an alkali mineral more commonly known as moonstone. She claims it is a chemical used in chemical weapons; it is of course actually used in a lot of cheap jewelry (and is the state gem of Florida.) In other words, scientific accuracy is not the strong point of the movie. Not that you were expecting it to be.

While a US Navy submarine is getting destroyed by the shark, Wade calls Kat ""Catfish"" in one of the worst lines of dialogue in film history. The nickname is repeated several times, and never gets better. Not that Kat deserves better: every line of dialogue she delivers is utterly wretched. If you think John Schneider's dialogue will improve with running time do not be fooled: he shortly gets to say ""Oh, if only I had a moustache to twirl!"" There is a bunch of even sillier science-babble about the shark being attracted to radio (""plasmotic signals,"" etc.) A senator is concerned that the beach stays open for the upcoming July fourth weekend (""the local economy depends on it!"") in a subplot that seems familiar for some reason.... Arguing against that is the fact that the super shark now knows how to walk on land and fly. It defeats an F-16, and comes ashore to eat several people, including the unrightful winner of the bikini contest: ""They say it came out of the water and walked on its fins""...""It ate the Queen of the Beach!"" And her tiara! When it eats the F-16, Kat comments ""It flies,"" to which Captain Jackson (Randy Mulkey, who is way older than most Army Captains) replies ""That's bad."" Yes, folks. That's what the dialogue is like.

We learn in rapid succession that the shark is a prehistoric beast that spent millions of years in suspended animation, and is a Department of Defense priority. Because it's so important they deploy the following to deter the beast: four soldiers, one F-16, a walking tank, and a boombox playing J.J. Walker's drivetime show, which is, it turns out, what really disturbs the shark. Ponder that for a second. After some terrible acting and some even worse special effects, the film comes to a moronic conclusion with John Schneider quoting Sarah Palin, making the laughable political moral that much more ridiculous.

The credits roll over the great ""Super Shark"" theme song, and it turns out that everybody gets a credit: Key Makeup was done by Dawn Subhasiriwatana, while Bikini Contestants included Kylee Nash and Harmony Blossum; the producers even extended a special than you to the Elks Club, Van Nuys, CA, in what turned out to be my favorite credit. My point here isn't that any of these people did anything wrong (in fact the makeup was actually quite good) but that when the credits are the most interesting part of the movie you know there is a problem. And there is. The movie reeks of chum. It has its moments of camp classic eye-rolling amusement, but it is not one of the better giant sea creature films from recent years.",1339891200,4,5779,4.775
4982776,2,B006BZ8NZM,"Instead of being suspenseful, you can't wait for these cheesy and predictable characters to be swallowed whole. The shark is great due to its size, but the graphics do not let you forget its fake. Walking megalodon... walking tank... even the bikini contest was lame... this movie is definitrly a let down.",1337990400,,306,4.903846153846154
4982777,3,B006BZ8NZM,"SUPER SHARK is another entry in the never-ending series of mutant killers, so  you know you can't set your expectations high.
This particular shark can walk around on the beach and even fly!  It is released when drilling at an oil rig causes an earthquake.  Of course, a seductive marine biologist shows up to investigate while the shark eats up most of the cast.  Sarah Lieving (MEGASHARK VS CROCOSAURUS) plays the biologist; John Schneider from TV's Hazzard county is the shady oil company chief; Jerry Lacy (Rev. Trask in the original DARK SHADOWS) has a small role as Schneider's boss; and B-movie action hero Tim Abell plays the renegade boat captain who helps Lieving.  Jimmie Walker shows up as a deejay at the local club who hosts (what else?) a bikini contest.
The shark effects are appropriately cheesy and notorious director Fred Olen Ray obviously didn't take the movie seriously either.
