7934134,5,B000059TNY,"The quote used for another Amazon.com (also Amazon.ca) review of (and in much publicity for) this delightful DVD (in North America, Pride Video PRI-31036) gives a good general idea of what it is about. To quote it again as a point of departure, this highly sexually charged summer idyll is ""[i]nspired by [E. Waugh's novel], `Brideshead Revisited'.... `Hazy Days of Summer' features seven [interwoven] sensual [male gay erotic] scenes [without dialogue] filmed on location in England's beautiful Home Counties"", with classical 19th century Romantic Period orchestral ""classical"" music chosen for the soundtrack. The result is inebriatingly suggestive and arousing.

The core of the males filmed consist of a summer picnic group of young men, including a postulant for Holy Orders (who is as randy and sexually active as the other lads of perpetual lay status), over whom an elderly Catholic priest presides, in the gently verdant English countryside. (One of the scenes, however, is set by the swimming pool of a country residence.) Some of the cast members are not of the picnic group, notably a randy and sexually aggressive, rugged young gardener who is drawn into the sexual revels as the boys encounter him, and he them, in their excursions. The seven scenes weave in and out as the boys couple variously (with one off-and-on threesome in the poolside scene), while the old priest nods off on a park bench (fully clothed, of course) for an afternoon nap.

None of these young lads is strikingly handsome to an exceptional degree, but each of them is radiantly healthy, has an appealingly fit body, and is excellently ""endowed"" for tenderly joyous, vigourous gay amourous actvity. Together they comprise a choice of various ""physical types"", from dainty to physically robust (but not excessively bulky in musculature). The boys' sheer good-natured spirits and breath-takingly hearty love-making compensate for the lack among them of even one prototypically perfect Adonis.

The gorgeously Romantic 19th century ""classical"" orchestral music provides a rich and very suitable background, excellently performed, to the boys' wordless revels. Perhaps a soundtrack entirely chosen from Frederick Delius' refulgently pantheistic orchestral works would have been even more appropriate, but that is merely a personal opinion and certainly does not reflect negatively on the excellent taste of those responsible for the film's soundscape.

This is an utter visual and musical delight, highly recommended!",1302048000,4,2499,5.416452442159383
