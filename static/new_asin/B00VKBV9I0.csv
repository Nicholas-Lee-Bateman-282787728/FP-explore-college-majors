8710365,4,B00VKBV9I0,"Well, I was very impressed by some scenes in this film, I was shocked by some others, and I think some were simply indifferent. The out-of-the-blue forceful entrance of Charles XII's 18th century army in a modern bar was fascinating, as was the scene in the bar back in 1943. Wow! It's astonishing to realize what unbelievable effects a director can present without using any of the modern technology. These anachronisms in the bar were really terrific, pure magic! Other parts of the film were not so good or so novel, but just OK. The horrible scenes a little before the finale in the ""homo sapiens"" chapter were extremely cruel. Were they meant to shock the viewer? I felt they were out of place, even in a film that supposedly studied our attitude toward death in its many forms.",1440979200,3,783,4.640287769784172
8710366,5,B00VKBV9I0,"The last part of Anderssons brilliant, loose trilogy about being a human being (Songs from the Second Floor was the 1st part. You, The Living the 2nd).  Although there's no need to have seen the earlier films to appreciate this one, since there's no overlap of character or even story, just style, mood and theme.

This film re-visits Andersson's unique, hysterically funny and sometimes tragic world view, and his unique style.  Anderssons camera never moves, never cuts within a scene.  He finds a great frame, and the image sits there while his sad-sack characters, usually wearing ultra-pale make up like
psychotic clowns, or silent movie comics, go through whatever bizarre silliness Andersson has devised.  The locations are never real, but are always elaborate, and frequently amazing sets, adding to the comic-nightmare feel.

There are a few characters who reappear through the film, like the two desperate novelty salesmen peddling vampire fangs and a hideous Uncle One-Tooth mask they have great faith in, giving off a distinctly Waiting for Godot vibe.  But theres nothing like an overall story.  Just a series of blackly comic vignettes, that slowly add up in a generally thematic way.

Andersson has a magical ability to be Monty Python level funny (or, perhaps given his slower pace Monty Python on downers), until suddenly it isn't funny  for a moment, or a scene  and you realize how sad it is underneath, as Andersson shows us the cruelty that humans are capable of, especially those with money or power, and the desperation that most of the rest of us live with, before going back to his grandly comic surreal hijinks.

No one else makes films like these, nor should anyone try.  This is a one-of-a-kind artist, and we should just feel lucky to have his cockeyed brilliance, holding up a funhouse mirror to ourselves and our society.",1440288000,3,1852,4.974025974025974
