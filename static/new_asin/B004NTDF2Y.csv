4436419,4,B004NTDF2Y,Two classics that are deep and well made films. Can't go wrong with either one. Expert filmaking at a fantastic price! I love both these films!,1332547200,2,143,4.538461538461538
4436420,5,B004NTDF2Y,"I bought this set primarily for the 'Jesse James' movie, which is dark, slow paced and cerebral, and features fine acting by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. This film may bore you if you are looking for action or plot twists, and you'll know if  it's right for you after about the first 15 or so minutes. If you can stick with it, Casey Affleck's smoldering performance is a revelation.

I had not seen ""Wyatt Earp"" before and it proved to be quite a pleasant surprise. It came out a year after ""Tombstone"" and wasn't as successful I guess, but this film strikes a good balance between being too violent or too fawning/watered down.  It pretty much follows the same main storyline as ""Tombstone"" with the addition of showing events that mold the younger Wyatt into the man he becomes  by the time he arrives at Tombstone.

Dennis Quaid does a good job with the Doc Holliday role, but Val Kilmer's performance will always be more memorable.

The movie clocks in at a bit over three hours, however it never dragged for me.
The cinematography in ""Wyatt Earp"" is beautiful, and the Blu-ray transfer is excellent - there are many dark/shadowy scenes that are rich in detail and have very little or no noise.  The frequent daytime panoramas are gorgeous. Warner did a wonderful job here.

If you want to add two very different,  good westerns to your Blue-ray collection, this combo set is a steal.",1328140800,16,1389,4.6138211382113825
4436421,4,B004NTDF2Y,"These movies offer studies of two larger-than-life old west figures and the effects that their fame had on their lives.  The gunslingers of the second part of the nineteenth century were the first ""reality stars"" in American history.  Both men profiled in these films had admirers and detractors who were attracted or repelled (or both) by the mythology that sprung from their deeds.  Wyatt Earp was something of an entrepreneurial genius, and he went into law enforcement when he realized that controlling the local police force was the best way to arrange your own security.  Jesse James was a former Confederate state guerrilla who became a train robber after the civil war because he realized that it was the only practical way to employ the skill-set he'd acquired during the conflict.  Both men were presented in the contemporary press as something more than human, and each of them came to live and die in the shadow of his own legend.

Neither of these films are conventional westerns.  Both are contemplative, slow, and each is a little too long.  The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is the better of the two movies in this package.  Strong performances by Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt keep the gravitas from lapsing into silliness.  The movie's visual palette, combined with the subject matter, make for a dry viewing experience.  Don't go into this film expecting an action-packed cowboy yarn.  Andrew Dominik's direction borrows more from Terrence Malick and Paul Thomas Anderson than from Sam Peckinpah or Sergio Leone.

Wyatt Earp attempts a more romantic examination of it's subject matter, with sweeping music and lots of gorgeous scenery.  This is film-making on a grand scale, although it frequently falls short of stirring the emotional swell it aims for.  It isn't as dry as The Assassination Of Jesse James... but it's just as slow, with long dialogue segments and charcter-driven set pieces.  Keven Costner is very good as Earp, presented here as a man driven to coldness and spite when the loss of his young wife deprives him of his ideals and optimism.  The strongest performance in the film, however, belongs to Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday.  Quaid presents Holiday as a cantankerous, rowdy bohemian; something that seems more drawn from comic books than history.  Still, it is a performance that is all at once huge fun, deeply dramatic, and sometimes surprisingly moving.  If every performance in this movie were as strong as Quaid's, the film's very long run-time would breeze by.

Jesse James and Wyatt Earp are controversial, contentious myths, but both were also men.  These two movies present attempts to reconcile the men and the legends, and both succeed from a certain perspective.  Neither of these films is a masterpiece by conventional standards, but they feature very good performances.  And both offer much to appeal to those with an interest in the politics and motivations behind the icons of the American west.",1323302400,3,2974,5.010183299389002
4436422,5,B004NTDF2Y,"The Jesse James movie is the best of the two.  Very underrated movie that didn't do well at the box office.  I thought the acting was very good and the location filming was outstanding.  The sets, the props and the wardrobes were perfect for the time they portrayed.  The Wyatt Earp movie is okay, Tombstone is better as we all know.  But I like western movies and I will watch it from time to time.",1318809600,2,399,4.266666666666667

4436440,4,B004NTDF2Y,"Held off buying this for a long time since Tombstone is my favorite but it was worth watching a more thorough historical account of Wyatt Earp. Haven't watch ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" yet, but 2 for the price of one is a good deal.",1366416000,,240,4.355555555555555
4436441,4,B004NTDF2Y,"Wyatt Earp is a bit overlong but a well done western..Costner tries to ce real Earp...there are so many stories about the legendary lawman. One isn't sure what to believe...gene hackman is great as earps strict dad.....the other western, with the overlong and thoroughly forgettable title is average at best..Brad Pitt is the films only asset",1362873600,2,342,5.125

8436804,5,B004NTDF2Y,Buying the single Wyatt Earp movie was more expensive than buying this double pack with the assassination of Jesse James which are both great movies and seem to be a very good quality Blu-Ray,1509062400,,191,4.647058823529412
8436805,4,B004NTDF2Y,"Long slow moving film about how Bob Ford shot & killed Jesse James of Missouri (1847 - 1882) who started as a guerilla/bushwhacker for the South then was hardened by Yankee heavy handedness into a train & bank robber.

Ford was smitten with the legend of Jesse James then was terrorized by the real man",1508803200,,302,4.490909090909091
