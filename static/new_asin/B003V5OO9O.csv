Unfortunately, the agonizingly slow pace and utterly boring story make this film an absolute waste of time.  Basically, it is a story about four people playing a really stupid video game.",1291593600,,281,4.6938775510204085
4208108,1,B003V5OO9O,"I'm a Mamoru Oshii fan..I really am. But I made a mistake by renting this movie--this movie lacked a story. I was so disappointed, I just had to look up other reviews on it because I took a chance & rented it since I saw the AWESOME cover and since it was directed by Mamoru Oshii. For those of you who want to check it out for yourselves, good luck. There was no storyline, the ACTOR/actresses were just mumbling--like they just quickly remember their lines real quick & it was just confusing. Still to this day I sit as I'm typing and ask myself ""What the hell did I just watch??"" So, yeah...I don't recommend this anyone.",1289779200,,624,4.3418803418803416
4208109,2,B003V5OO9O,"Seriously.  During the boss fight one of the toons was just dancing.  If ever there was a time for shouting MINUS FIFTY DKP that was it.  Really it would be SWKP for Sand-Whale Kill Points.

This movie is weak on all points except silly costumes.  It has great silly costumes.

And it really is about the absurdity that you find inside an MMORPG.  The one girl just spends her time dancing.  There is ninja-looting, hardcore soloing, PvP, and sand whales.

I feels like this movie was filmed in English, but it also feels like only one of the four speaking characters can actually speak English.  The talking can be quite painful.

I originally described this movie as an empathetic DO NOT WATCH.  But I've softened my stance since then.  If you like MMORGs, and can view this movie for cheap, go ahead.  Just don't expect much.",1288656000,,828,4.582191780821918
4208110,1,B003V5OO9O,"I purchased this film, since the description sounded promising.  However, I was very disappointed. When researching this film, I saw several conflicting reviews of the films length.  It turned out to be only 1:10 (70 minutes).  The first 5-10 minutes comprise a lengthy monologue setting the stage.  The speaker seemed to mumble, so it was difficult to hear or make any sense of the opening monologue.  Then, we meet the four characters in a very superficial way, with the female lead, Meisa Kuroki ""Gray"" most developed.  The film moves excruciatingly slowly.  In the end, there were precious few moments of any action.  The director's style might of worked in a much longer production.  As it turned out, the film was cut short before it even got going.  Most unfortunate, as the concept for the film was most interesting.",1288483200,5,824,4.905797101449275
4208111,2,B003V5OO9O,"I usually have low standards for movies - I understand that not everything can be a ""classic"" and some movies are just stupid.. but fun to watch! They may lack in plot/story, acting or writing, but they're often at least enjoyable.

Unfortunately, even going in with low standards I was very disappointed in Assault Girls.

Being a big fan of Oshii - director of Ghost in the Shell (and Innocence), Avalon and a number of Anime titles - I really wanted to see this one despite the bad reviews. ""Maybe they just didn't get it?"" I though. After watching it, I realize I was in the wrong - the movie just was even tough to sit through (even at just 70 minutes!)

I will say that it looked nice! If nothing else, it's a nice ""show off"" piece for Blu-Ray. Most shots are very sharp, detailed and impressive. The camera (or editing style) does seem to vary a bit as some shots are more desaturated, grainy and less detailed. It uses a lot of CGI which is ""above average"" level - not the horribly done types you see from time to time, but nothing hollywood-level.

Audio is in English - there is a narrator who comes on from time to time (as someone mentioned - this is not subtitled). The girls speak english quite poorly (not even on the level that it may be a second language, more of a ""Say this"" and they repeat it. No tone to their dialog and it's sometimes hard to listen to -- if you've ever seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sukiyaki-Western-Django-Blu-ray/dp/B001CITQWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sukiyaki Western Django [Blu-ray</a>] - it's a bit worse than that). I felt that would have been much better if done in their native language. Their dialog is subtitled (on by default) since they're a bit difficult to understand at times. Either way, their dialog is a bare minimum (the narrator does most of the talking).

Video quality on the Blu-Ray is very good, audio isn't bad either. I'd say the video quality of the Blu-Ray would be the reason to watch this -- on DVD, it doesn't even have that benefit. Extras are also very minimal (trailers only - and seemingly just thrown on the disc as they're non-anamorphic (black bars on top/bottom/left/right).

Overall, I really wanted to like this, but it just didn't do anything for me. Going back now and watching the trailer, it even makes me want to see the movie again.. until I remember the trailer is basically the movie itself with 95% of the stuff that made it boring cut out.",1288396800,3,2483,4.736111111111111
4208112,2,B003V5OO9O,"""Assault Girls'"" concept and setting are something of a sequel to director Mamoru Oshii's movie ""Avalon"" from a decade ago, though there are no returning characters or need to have seen it first. I loved ""Avalon"", a twisty little story about a virtual reality gamer both inside and outside of the game, with both mind-bending and dramatic moments.
""Assault Girls"" is thus a disappointment. It takes place entirely within the game's virtual world, this time a bleak fantasy landscape of wasteland infested with giant worms. It moves at a turgid pace with lots of posing for striking visuals but very little happening in a very simple plot (four gamers find they must team up to take down the biggest, baddest giant worm, but first must negotiate how to split the reward.) It never takes us to these players real lives or the real world; this is completely a game scenario. It doesn't seem to have Oshii's usual intellectual flare, or a sense of drama. I hate to say it, but I found it dull.
Perhaps surprisingly, most of the dialog is in English (which is, we are told, the ""official language of the game"".) The narrator and the ""game master"" speak excellent English; the four Japanese actors (three female, one male) speak English with strong accents, so their dialog, even when it's in English, is subtitled, as it is when they switch to Japanese. (The narrator's and game master's dialog isn't subtitled; that will disappoint those with impaired hearing who depend on subtitles as close-captioning.)",1288310400,,1501,4.890196078431373
4208113,3,B003V5OO9O,"The movie is classic Oshii but with out much of a plot.  Long moments of slow scenic scenes punctuated by bits of action.  When I say long and slow, I mean it.  One potion of the move involves a sort of montage of the four characters walking through the desert and dealing with a snail... for 15 minutes.

The action is hokey and done more for imagery then the action itself.  Its fun to see the girls pose as they fire guns or spells.

The CG is obvious but sufficient for getting the point across.  This is not a big Hollywood blockbuster so don't expect King Kong or Avatar level effects, this is only a step above TV shows like Sanctuary..

The characters are only hinted at.  There really isn't any development and they have little dialog. (one has nothing but a few squawks)  They are simply defined by mannerisms and costume.

The story is bare one. Its only about the four putting aside their name calling for five minutes to defeat the end boss.  That is it. The story could have been done in thirty minutes (or 15) but its Oshii and he loves to draw out scenes of the characters cooking, or watching the sunset or spontaneously dancing.  It would have been much better if it had cut down on the sunsets and you could actually see how Grey convinced the other two to join the party.

This isn't a bad flick.  Its just not a good one either.  Everything is interesting over exciting or dramatic and the philosophical bit are out of place.  It has fun moments too, like the duel.  All in all, I didn't hate it, but it'll be a rare occurrence when I pull it off the shelf to watch it again.

One thing I want to add.  If you have ever played an MMO you will appreciate some of the strangeness of the movie if you catch it.  You have four players stuck trying to get past a boss to reach the next level.  A solo player who does his own thing and doesn't like to play with others.  A player who min/maxes stats and cheats when she can.  A player who is hardcore and 'better' then the rest. And one who doesn't take the game seriously and screws around during fights.

Now make them work together to take out the boss.

That amused me.",1287878400,25,2138,4.256218905472637
4208114,2,B003V5OO9O,"First off, what buyers need to know is, this movie has the entire opening narrator dialogue with the subtitles disabled. Subtitles don't come up until the first actual character speaks, which is a long time.
I usually turn on subtitles even for english language movies due to loud noises around my home and just in case the dialogue is a wisper, you still can see what was said.
Lets also look at this from a deaf person's point of view. A long time in the opening of the movie, they will have no way of knowing anything that was said by the narrator. This is unsatisfactory.
Now onto the actual movie. It was aweful. The ""gaming"" by the main characters was unrealistic and unbelievably poor even for todays CG standards. It was over-acted and just plain unentertaining.
I normally am not this hard on a movie but this was just bad. One example: A high caliber rifle/sniper does the same damage to a bird (crow) as it does to a jet-plane and a mech robot? A cliff hanger ending that tells you they want to make a second movie gave me chills.
No special features...at all? How can a movie in this day and age not have a single special feature, behind the scenes or even a commentary?

4208119,4,B003V5OO9O,"Clearly, this movie isn't for everyone, based on the reviews, but I like strange flicks, and I enjoyed this one.

Still, I see how other folks might not like it.  The tempo is languid if you're being pleasant about it, painfully slow to many though.  There isn't a lot of action, but what there is, is good.  And, of course, the general weirdness of the movie set inside a video game.

The introduction is eight or nine minutes of a narrator explaining how a virtual reality game came into being and became the center of some people's lives.  And I'll be the first to admit that this is the most challenging part of the movie to sit through, for me.

Jager, Grey, Colonel, Lucifer, are the players, who band together in order to advance in the game.  From the offset, there is a lot of tension between the players, and cooperation is neither natural nor easy for them.  I'm sure the story could be considered predictable, but I enjoyed the character development.

It was imaginative, original, and took risks in the presentation.  No surprisingly, it doesn't work for everyone.

Odd little flick.  I enjoyed, but can see how many wouldn't.

4208120,2,B003V5OO9O,"I first saw this at New York Comic Con 2010. What was advertised in the program book about this movie was totally misleading (for shame!). While I can give a run down about the plot, or the lack of, but just about every other reviewer has done so and I just don't want to... relive the movie. Again. So what if this movie is slow (fast forward!), makes you wonder where this is all leading to (get to the point already!) and the rare amounts of dialogue, well the less said about the script the better... but it does feature hot girls, awesome action in the few exciting parts it does have and the ending is pretty epic. Epic in the I-can't-believe-I-wasted-my-time-to-see-it-end-like-this, epic. So yeah, I give it a two for the graphics, girls and nothing much else.",1323561600,,768,4.572463768115942
4208121,2,B003V5OO9O,"The premise of ""Assault Girls"" is actually very cool and could have been very interesting. Unfortunately the execution of the movie is not up to modern standards and looks more like a well funded student film project rather than a professional, albeit low budget, movie release.

No plot spoilers from me: There really isn't much in the way of a plot, four players in virtual gaming world need to set aside their solo tendencies and work together to complete a level. The setting is a very bleak landscape that has the gamers interacting with CG (computer generated) elements, including ""gimmicks"" (like user transports), weapons, and monsters. The CG ranges from just plain bad to very good, which also throws off the feel of the movie. There really isn't much in the way of acting to comment on as there is almost no character development and little real dialog (an odd mix of English and Japanese, with erratic use of subtitles). The name is also not quite accurate, perhaps they should have called it ""Mostly Action Girls"" since there are four human players, three females and one male. The action, when it happens, is actually pretty good and there is duel scene that is somewhat amusing (probably my favorite bit). I did like the costuming\wardrobe as it caught the feel of what gamers would choose.

This would have made a great short, perhaps a half hour long, but it really has too much lag between action scenes to invest the time in to make worthwhile recommending it or seeing it again.

4208122,1,B003V5OO9O,"Wow, this movie sucks as a whole. All the reviews on here were right. It's super slow and boring. There was a 10 min intro with no action and just talk about the background story, which wasn't very interest and super boring. There things that I do like. I thought the main girl was very cute, and the other two girls were all right looking too. I really like their costumes they wearied. The graphics and special effects were pretty good. I like how the ending they wanted to screw over the guy player and that was very funny to watch.

Even though there were things I did like about the movie, it couldn't stop it from getting a one star. This movie is just plain boring! It doesn't need to be a 1 hour movie and could had been a 30 min show or so. There were just nonsense of things shown and they were shown way too long as well. Do you really need to see each character just walking around thinking for 10 mins? They're not doing anything, but sitting, standing, or just walking. WTF?

This movie also suffers for being a bilingual movie. They do talk in English and Japanese throughout the movie. I was reading the subs while they were speaking English. I was reading the subs while they were speaking Japanese. WTF? They should had just stuck with a pure Japanese because they know how to act while speaking Japanese and they know how to show their emotions about it. But, while they're try to act in English, they speak it with heavy accents and they don't know how to show their emotions on what they are truly saying.

The thing about languages is, it is not what you say, but how you say it!

When you say a bad word, you say it with feeling!!! Do you say it in a whisper? No, I bet you don't. But these actors did! In this movie, you don't see or hear the emotion when the actors were speaking English. They tend to just read off their lines and say it like it was a nice word. Doing so, does throw off the point of expressing the purpose of saying bad words or their meaning to them.

On the other hand, when they were speaking in Japanese and saying those bad words, you can hear and feel their expressions on what they really mean. They didn't say it like a whisper and act all casual about it like in English. They said it with feeling!!! Why? Because they knew what the words really meant, and so, they acted it out.

Only watch this movie if you just got nothing to watch, like I did. Remember it's still a 1 star movie, so you probably will not like it. Then, you will come back on here and write a 1 star review about it.",1315612800,2,2540,4.205338809034908

When I read the synopsis, I expected wall to wall action and hot girls. Well I want to tell you, this was a very boring movie with only 2 action scenes and both were just ok. Plot development or character development was virtually none existing. There were very long drawn out scenery scenes to fill in the very short 85 minutes or so of this movie. And what scenery? desert... plain sandy desert in the whole movie. Big budgets here lol.... If someone was to re-edit this movie and take out all the non essential parts, it would be a 10 minute short. This movie was obviously trying to satisfy the gamer fans which I am an avid gamer. But the movie failed, epic fail!!. There has only been 2 other movies I hated as much as this one which I won't mention. So if I could rate this with minus (-) I would give it a -5.

4208124,2,B003V5OO9O,"""Assault Girls"" takes place sometime after a global nuclear war, but you'd never know it if you weren't told that.  In the down time of folks trying to rebuild human civilization, people find pleasure and escapism in a unified world-wide hyper-realistic virtual reality MMORPG that links directly into the brain.

We are never shown the real world---only the game universe, and the film follows three women: Gray (.50 caliber Sniper), Lucifer (shapeshifting ""wereraven"" Magician), and Colonel (Warrior), as well as a single man: J&auml;ger (20mm Sniper), who all try to complete a level individually, but cannot because they lack the power to kill the end boss.  Eventually realizing they can't succeed on their own, they begrudgingly form a party to kill the boss to progress to the next stage.

The ""plot"" (and I use that term loosely) blatantly and tiredly borrows from many similar shows, most notably the "".hack//Sign"" anime series, but the film is set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi world instead of medieval fantasy, and it lacks the dynamism and polish of its various spiritual predecessors.  Instead, this film takes one single aspect of one single day, and tries to work a story around it.  But it doesn't work, because things are so tunnel-visioned and so myopic, that everything is reduced to near nothingness, and plot development is stalled and almost sacrificed altogether so we ""can"" exist in the same singular second the characters on screen exist in, instead of any type of plot progression past the immediate moment we are ""supposed"" to be locked into.  That might be an interesting experiment for a different type of existentialism film, but when we have guns, babes, dropships, mechs, and fighter bombers, it is wholly unacceptable because it wastes all of that.

Under a more clever or skilled writer, this movie still could have been workable and cool, but the film also inherently fails because it has no clear direction.  In addition to wanting to be nothing but a snapshot of a Player Character's life in-fiction, it also wants to be too much out of the fiction in real life---i.e., sci-fi, fine art, social commentary, combat, philosophical, action, comedy, girls-with-guns, sexploitation, mecha, but it fails on all counts because it lacks the focus to carry each aspect out.

The most glaring flaw, is the painfully boring down time in which the characters aimlessly wander the same exact 20 yards of film space on a hill in search of packs of badly CGIed ""Dune"" inspired giant sand worms (the only antagonists in the film, not including the main characters) that when killed, grant differing levels of experience points depending on the normal worms or the more powerful level boss.  The film is only about an hour and ten minutes long, but about 55 minutes of that IS the down time, and we are stuck literally watching someone walk back and forth.  When we do finally get some combat and action, it's very fast, and painfully CGI.

A second flaw, is the absolutely atrocious selection of dialogue.  Most of the movie is in English, but towards the last quarter, everyone starts speaking Japanese, and it stays that way up until the very end.  I'm not sure if this was done to grab a larger viewership market by speaking English over Japanese, but it fails.  And here's the clincher: the English wasn't even dubbed over, it was the actual actors and actresses speaking it.  But with the exception of the narrator/computer voice and Lucifer, everyone had such strong accents, spoke so slowly, and were so unfamiliar with English language, it was very difficult to understand what is being said half the time, especially scenes in which everyone is talking while also wearing a rebreather mask that muffles what they say.  (Thankfully there's subtitles you can turn on.)  Lucifer on the other hand, had no speaking lines at all. Instead, she communicated (?) to the audience by dancing in a very odd, almost autistic way, complete with her own ""music box"" sounding theme song.  It was weird, but she filled the typical role of the cliched and expected quintessentially aloof and eccentric character found in the majority of J-pop shows or J-RPGs that the creators and fans seemingly can't get enough no matter how often it's done.

This film was written and directed by Mamoru Oshii (director of the two theatrical ""Ghost in the Shell"" films), and this was billed as the first new live-action film he did since taking an 8-year hiatus from it.  He should have stayed away a little longer to hone his skills, because he's really rusty.  (That, or he spent so much time working with anime, that he can't make the leap back into flesh and blood film making.)  As stated, there is a distinct lack of any backgrounds except the top and side of a sandy hill the team decided to film at.  There is no real characterization except Lucifer's odd dancing.  Even the quality of cinematography is very plain and simple, and reinforces the ""boring aspect"" that the film radiates as a whole.  This felt like a bunch of cosplay friends getting together and making a low budget ad-libbed sci-fi movie on a Saturday afternoon on a hill overlooking a stone quarry, and then using a PC to add in the CGI effects later on.

The only aspect I thought was well done, were the costumes.  They were pretty cool, and next to post-production CGI, that's where a good chunk of the money went.  The ending was also very funny, but you'd have to be familiar with online gaming antics to fully appreciate it.  That alone almost made up for the sheer snooze-fest of the rest of the film.  Almost, but not quite.  Too much was already holding the film back.

If you have nothing better to do, or if your only options are watching paint dry, going to a wedding ceremony in a dry county for people you don't know, doing calculus homework, or watching this, go for this.  But if not, rent or buy at your own risk.  And if you do, be prepared for a 65+ minute unintended pseudo-nihilistic film that drags out and feels like three hours.",1310947200,6,6026,4.799612778315586

4208131,1,B003V5OO9O,"There was so much contemplative navel-gazing in this one, even Ingmar Bergman was fidgeting. ASSAULT GIRLS is horrid in its glacial pace and in its lack of content and just all around crap storytelling. The running time is 70 minutes but, really, the story, for what it had to offer, should've been boiled down to 15 minutes. Then it would've been a decent short. As it is, the film is broken up in chapters, with each chapter opening with some brain-hurting philosophical text caption. In the Why Should I Be The Only Sorry Bastard To Suffer Dept., here's one such bit of gobbelygook: ""Augury is not limited to fortune-telling. A god's will indicated through the results of augury conveys the meaning of that which will appear when the time has come. In other words, the characters used in augury will not end with augury. The characters seek augury to appear."" Even Confusius says, ""Huh?""

I had an ominous feeling from jump, when the film kicked things off with a voiceover narration from hell that droned on and on for more than seven minutes. The voiceover guy probably had some pertinent high concept stuff to impart, but his jibber-jabber was so soul-killingly dreary I don't see how he can maintain anyone's attention. Anyway, the plot revolves around four characters armed with heavy artillery and navigating a bleak wasteland, the setting for the virtual game Avalon (f). Meisa Kuroki (the stunning ""Gray""), Hinako Saeki (""Colonel""), and Rinko Kikuchi (black-winged ""Lucifer"") play three of the characters and then there's also some dude named ""Jager,"" who is an ace marksman. Their targets are these giant sand worms, with each pixelated kill earning them high scores. Eventually all four players team up to take down the End Boss, which is the uber-sand worm, the holy of holies in terms of amassing points. Mostly, though, these folks wander the desert more than Moses.

To say that there is good character development would be to say a lie. We don't learn squat about the gamers' real lives. There is minimal dialogue. One of the game's conceits is that participants must speak in English, except that the Japanese cast struggles mightily with English. Going by their delivery, there's a strong sense that they were merely phonetically sounding out their lines. The accents are so thick that without the provided English sub-titles, comprehension would've been nada.

The ""Lucifer"" character comes off as interesting, initially. She plays around with her bowler hat, likes to dance, can shapeshift into a giant crow, demonstrates an impish persona. But it doesn't go anywhere. ""Colonel"" is a complete non-entity. ""Gray"" is the most beautiful and gets the most screen time, and she and ""Jager"" - with their replay fight sequences - arrive at my one favorite bit in the film. By the way, in a virtual one-on-one match, with various hi-tech weaponry at your disposal, would you, like Jager, opt for a baseball bat? Not that it matters. Gray delivers an outstanding smackdown... over and over and over.

The film drowns in stark images and lingering camera shots and overwrought allegory (that statue and that snail, what's up with those?). I will say that the visual graphics are pretty decent, and that things finally do pick up in the last 15 minutes. Still, the best thing about this DVD is probably the trailer to IP MAN 2.

""It is impossible to defeat Desert 22 flying solo. You should consider joining a party,"" the game master's omnipresent voice suggests for the umpteenth time. That's probably the real reason why the gamers joined forces. To get that annoying voice to just friggin' shut it. ASSAULT GIRLS, avoid it like a vicious chop at your Adam's apple. Or, if given a choice, take the vicious chop.",1295568000,2,3724,4.914149443561208
4208132,4,B003V5OO9O,"Though I'm a fan of Oshii's movies, I'm always conflicted about recommending his movies to those who have made a diet of traditional Hollywood films. Many of his films integrate Hollywood style sequences with his preferred style of pacing; which is typically very deliberate and slow. ""Assault Girls"" is no different, although he does shake things up a bit with the movie's structure. Those who have familiarized themselves with Oshii's work know that extended takes and long monologues are signature of his films. With ""Assault Girls"" he modulates these elements into chapters. The pre-chapter introduction opens up with a 10 minute monologue that provides a basis for the story, the creation of the game Avalon, as well as giving Oshii a chance to make statements about ""Pax Technologica"" in a globalized society. The voice over is a bit mumbled and subtitles, which are disabled at this point in the film, would have helped in penetrating the dense editorial text of this narrative. However, after rewinding a few times for clarification, I found the lengthy introduction to be thought-provoking and my favorite segment of the film.

Following the introduction we get five chapters that take us through a sort of mini-plot that finds four competing characters having no choice but to put aside their quarrels in order to battle the big boss of the game Avalon, who otherwise could not be defeated alone. Over the course of the five chapters we get the three cinematic ""flavors"" that Oshii is known best for: a big-bang opening battle involving three sexy female gamers fighting off oversized sand worms; an entire chapter devoted to long silent takes of the gamers wandering the world of Avalon somewhat aimlessly; and finally, a very amusing chapter where two gamers settle a dispute in one-to-one combat (yes, Oshii does humor every now and then). Chapter 3, the infamous chapter that has our four gamers wandering the dessert of Avalon, feels like a skippable chapter (15 minutes in length), especially since the symbolism, that might make the sequence more meaningful, completely escapes me (there are numerous shots of a snail that, for all I know, could symbolize the slow nature of the sequence itself). But if you can get past Chapter 3 (or if you decide to just skip past it), you might decide that ""Assault Girls"" makes for an entertaining and even fun ""short-film"". Newcomers to Oshii's work might understandably be put-off or put to sleep. However, those of us who enjoy absorbing his philosophy through film and animation, have a better chance at being satisfied by this appetizer. I think.

4208133,1,B003V5OO9O,"I cannot rate this movie low enough. I know the trailer and the cover look cool, but it's a total lie. What I tell you now is not an exaggeration or a fabrication of any sort, it is 100% true. This movie is a 15 minute short film that has been padded in length to a feature film with shots of environments, clouds, posing actors, and french art house crap. I swear to God this is true, there is 15 minutes of actual movie, with 1.15 hours of screen saver.",1293840000,2,455,4.066666666666666
4208134,4,B003V5OO9O,"And that's pretty much what this is. 4 hardcore players that like to solo that need to come together to beat the last boss. There's not much dialogue from the characters but there are lots and lots of visuals. This movie points at the mentality of people that play MMO's so if you don't and never have played one it's easy to not understand what's going on or why.

I gave the movie a 4 because I enjoyed it. It wasn't cheap by any means and it had great and I mean great effects! The only problem I have with the movie is that this probably could have been trimmed down to 30 minutes only! Great movie idea but poor execution, I actually wish it carried on into a real plot or story aside from joining together to kill one boss to gain access to the next tier or whatever.

If they made a sequel I wouldn't mind watching I just hope it's subbed and it has more story and less imagery. I liked the concept of the movie a lot but I understand not everyone is going to ""Get it"" which is probably why the movie is rated so low. This is more of a renter than an owner but it's a good renter for mmo gamers.",1293753600,4,1102,4.0504587155963305

8406420,5,B003V5OO9O,"The end is the beginning - let the game begin......watched in reverse order this film is an experimental & dreamlike tone poem of otherwordly & mysterious solitude and imagination. I have never watched this film in it's straight through playthrough order.

Desolate wide open spaces, monster worms and battles, strange rules, isolation. This film explores a recurring motif in Oshii's work of disparate individuals being drawn together.

Reverse Order?? - On the Dvd menu, starting the film at chapter 9, then 7, 5 , 4, 3, 2, 1, provides the narrative tone mentioned above. This also coincides with the individual chapter start and end title cards within the footage itself, signifying when it's time to move back to the next section for it to play out, going from 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, then no chapter title card (think of it as chapter 0 perhaps) & finally the prologue - which is now a dramatically weighted & concluding Epilogue instead !

 There is a line through narrative that transitions nicely includ9ing the end of one chpater to the start of the previous all the way through until finishing with what is now an epic epilogue.  I was going to describe in detail the ialm's narrative journey when viewed in this way but i think i'll just mention the broad strokes: The four characters win a battle, cheat on each other, then being addicted to the game experience, start another quest to battle more monsters even though they don't like each other.

 That is the film's narrative which takes place with a uniquely atmospheric, otherwordly & haunting tone when the End is the Beginning - let the game begin ever after.

Another cool film as part of Oshii's conceptual virtual cinematic universe.",1498262400,,1695,4.8006872852233675

The first 8 minutes of this 70 minutes film is a monologue explaining the state of the world and people seek enjoyment in virtual video games. Then we see a snail, appropriately enough, then another 6 minutes of a guy walking in a barren wasteland. Four fighters team up to fight the end boss, because they can't fight him alone. I am sure there was some cultural aspect I was missing. What was Lucifer and the derby and dance thing? Might be good for people who like to watch gamers.

8406426,3,B003V5OO9O,"After watching the trailer on Youtube I just had to have this movie. I've always been a fan of Japanese live action sci-fi. Unfortunately, the trailer contains all of the great action sequences and what you get during the film is a whole lot of slow, plodding moments where the characters either stare off into the distance or dance for no reason while the narrator repeats his dire warning that the primary monster in the game cannot be killed by a single player. I actually fell asleep halfway through and had to re-watch the back half once I woke up. I only recommend this film for collectors of Japanese science fiction.

8406428,3,B003V5OO9O,"For myself, I would give it more stars, because I got it for the visuals -- the landscapes, the costumes, the atmosphere -- and Rinko Kikuchi. It's very atmospheric and has a strange loveliness to it, the beauty of deserts and empty places. And Kikuchi is adorable and beautiful. The other ladies in the film are also gorgeous with wonderful costumes and very strong, determined, independent personalities. And there are some funny moments -- I laughed aloud a couple of times.

If you're looking for a film with things like a plot, or character development, or suspense, or big action scenes? Well, it has a plot, but it's so ridiculously simple it barely counts. There's very little character development -- and by ""very little"" I mean I didn't see any. You learn one or two things about a couple of the characters, but it only comes in brief moments of dialog and is never followed up on. There's a tiny bit of suspense as you wonder whether [spoilers], and the action scenes provide just enough action to highlight the overall quietness of the landscape and the film. It's set in a virtual reality MMO, and I'll tell you, if my game had so little actual action in it I would probably stop playing.

I can't recommend it for most moviegoers, but if you're drawn to movies that are beautiful to look at and you don't need much more, well, this one is, in my opinion, beautiful to look at. I only wish I could find out where it was filmed.",1385769600,,1440,4.5346153846153845
