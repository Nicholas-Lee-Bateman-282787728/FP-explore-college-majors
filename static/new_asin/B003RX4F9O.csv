8471855,5,B003RX4F9O,"Blitzkrieg in the Streets is a must for the serious street fighter! This DVD demonstrates real world scenarios where the understanding of probable reaction dynamics is critical to dominate and end a street fight or violent confrontation. Throughout this DVD, Sammy first gives an example in real time of a confrontation, then breaks it down in slow motion to explain the reason why the primary attack blow/strike was chosen, how it is executed and what the follow up secondary attacks could be, or the exit strategy if needed. The strength of this DVD lies in being able to study both the action and reaction to the strikes and counters. By taking time to study both, the street fighter not only becomes proficient, but also tactical. Great DVD!!",1386374400,,746,4.881889763779528
