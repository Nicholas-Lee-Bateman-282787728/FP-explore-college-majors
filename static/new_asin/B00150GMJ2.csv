8256873,5,B00150GMJ2,"To this day my favorite documentary on Napoleon, and the highlight of the series.  While it is not long enough to go very in-depth on Napoleon's past, its focus on the Austerlitz campaign shows Napoleon's tactical and strategic planning processes that allowed him to outfight so many opponents.  Excellent narraration, and superb choices for commentators (particularly the late David Chandler) do real justice to the events and the men who lived through them.  I find I much prefer the ""Ken Burns-esque"" maps and paintings versus re-enactors, but that is a personal preference so if you want costumes and actors you should look elsewhere.  Have watched multiple times, and a great choice for school presentations due to its short length.",1407196800,,737,5.168067226890757
8256874,5,B00150GMJ2,"The Great Commanders:  Napoleon Bonaparte has a running time of 45 minutes, and is narrated by Brian Cox, with expert commentary from a number of scholars such as David Chandler, Jay Luvaas, Christopher Duffy, and Major-General Huw Pike.  As the title of the series implies, the video focuses more on Napoleon as commander (in general, through the course of the campaign, during the battle) than 1805: The Battle of Austerlitz does.  The images are all paintings, sculptures, engravings, and drawings of the era.  The narration and commentary are excellent, and as in the case of 1805: Austerlitz, the map graphics are very clear and informative.  Additionally, the film's chapters  ""The Army,"" ""Strategy,"" ""Tactics,"" ""Motivation,"" etc. clearly present the variety of factors that contributed to Bonaparte's victory.  The wider array of experts, the superiority of the images, the better organization and the total lack of ""quirks"" gives this video the edge over 1805: the Battle of Austerlitz.  In sum, The Great Commanders: Napoleon Bonaparte is an outstanding documentary.",1256428800,,1075,5.395209580838324
