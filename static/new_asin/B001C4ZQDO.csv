8286118,2,B001C4ZQDO,"I ordered this DVD in Spanish because they stopped releasing the normal DVD's right in the middle of the series. Instead of completing the set and releasing the rest of the season, FUNimation started to release the ""widescreen"" version of the show in the orange boxes. The Saiyan Prince was the last disc released in the Ultimate Uncut series and can only be found in Spanish. Amazon's description said it comes with English subtitles, which I would have been fine with. However, the English subtitles do not exist on this disc. It is Spanish audio and text. Nothing else.",1356393600,,572,4.787878787878788
8286119,3,B001C4ZQDO,"If you read the description and think this has an English Audio Track...
IT DON'T!!!!
It has no menu. and its in 16:9 widescreen...

But if you speak spanish, You Lucky Bastard.. This is for you, your only 2 away from a complete set.. And it'll be that way forever..LoL

The three stars doesn't rate the actual DVD, cause i couldn't watch it... Its about the wrong description...",1345334400,,379,4.5588235294117645
