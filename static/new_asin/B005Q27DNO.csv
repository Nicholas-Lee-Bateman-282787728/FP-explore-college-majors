4857835,5,B005Q27DNO,my favorite show i have every season. show is just as good without Stabler (Chris Meloni) as it was with him,1352505600,,108,4.190476190476191
4857836,5,B005Q27DNO,"I thought this show would really suffer without the old Olivia/Elliot chemistry, but it has remained interesting.  They were able to take Benson's character to some new places this season.  It doesn't all work, but it's fun to see the writers and actors experiment a little with the formula.  The DVDs themselves are of excellent quality, although I *really* wish we could some extra features once in a while!",1351987200,,409,4.898550724637682
4857837,5,B005Q27DNO,"I am a SVU addict and own all 13 seasons, too bad you can't buy them in HD (Unfortunately in Europe you can't buy them one by one). This one as a great one although I miss Elliot and Dr. Huang (he is only seen on one episode and is great as always). The new detectives are just that: NEW, each with his/her own personality and agenda. All in all I enjoyed it very much!",1351641600,,369,3.933333333333333
4857838,5,B005Q27DNO,"At the begining of season 13, we see Olivia Benson (Emmy and Golden Globe Winner Mariska Hargitay) has lost her partner Elliot Stabler after 12 years of working together, due to his sudden ""retirement"". What happens over the next 23 episodes is some of the best dramatic network television produced last year. Why it didn't receive several Emmy Nominations is a case that needs solving.",1350518400,3,386,4.953846153846154
4857839,5,B005Q27DNO,"After season nine, I felt that the show changed in more ways than with the cast. Most of the episodes weren't even about rape, abuse, pedophilia, etc. Some of the episodes I did not like include ""Swing,"" ""Lunacy,"" ""Babes,"" ""Wildlife,"" ""Liberties,"" ""Zebras,"" ""Solitary,"" ""Hammered,"" ""Spooked,"" ""Turmoil,"" ""Anchor,"" ""Shadow,"" ""Savior,"" ""Beef,"" ""Shattered,"" and for season 12 it would be easier the names the episodes I did like. But the worst I've seen of any of the Law & Order shows was ""Bombshell"" from season 12. It was the worst of any show ever. The plot was stupid, the outcome was worse and I saw the incestuous relationship coming a mile away.

The changes in season 13 were a must not only for SVU, but for everything that is Law & Order. SVU has had the same principle characters since season 2. The show needed new characters, but not a psychiatrist or an ADA or a Medical Examiner (though varied and fresh actors for those roles would help), but the show needed new detectives. Kelli Giddish is fun to have as Det. Amanda Rollins. Other than having another female Detective in a Sex Crimes Unit, her character's history and flaws were interesting as well. A Sex Crimes detective from another state who moved because her affair with her boss and a gambling problem. Danny Pino on the other hand plays Det. Nick Amaro. Another Narc transferred to SVU. But this one wears a suit, unlike Fin. Nick's wife fought in Afghanistan and Iraq and they have a daughter. Their marriage is a little rocky and have issues involving trust. Nick does feel almost like a rehash of Stabler, but hopefully, the writers will work on avoiding that symmetry in season 14. The ADAs are all recurring, because there is never never just one case and there there are multiple people in the ME's CSU and TARU showing that there are more people in those departments than just Morales, O'Halleran and Warner. Sease 13 is worth watching. Don't let Stabler's absence stop you from enjoying this breath of fresh hair.",1349308800,7,1995,4.749279538904899
4857840,4,B005Q27DNO,"I have in my film/TV DVD Collection ALL of the available ""L&O"" DVDs of the entire Franchise, naturally inc. all 12 pervious years of ""L&O-SVU"". So, making this purchase was a no brainer. However, I didn't expect to miss Christopher Meloni's Det. Elliot Stabler as much as I did. The new additions to the cast; Kelli Giddish as Det. Rollins & Danny Pino (""Cold Case"") as Det. Nick Amaro are ok (Pino, who played Det. Scotty Valens on CBS' ""Cold Case"" might as well still be playing Valens).
The saving grace of this Season is 1.)excellent story-lines, especially for a show in it's 13th Season! There are some really fresh plot-lines in many of the 23 episodes (spent over 5 discs). & 2.)the amazing guest stars that this particular ""Law & Order"" branch has become famous for. All of the ""L&O"" shows have brought in great guests, but 'SVU' has always been the leader of the pack in that regard! Kevin Pollack, T.R. Knight, Chloe Sevigny, Treat Williams, Faanco Nero, Harry Connick Jr., Dan Lauria, Andre Braugher, & Eric Close all play incredible guest-starring roles! For those interested, the cover-art/packaging is in the same format & design as the last 7 Season Sets (the design that started w/ Year 6); 3 slip-sleeves in a clam-shell type box. For those die-hard fans/collectors of the ""L&O"" Franchise (like myself), it's really a must-have! For the casual fan & occasional buyer that loved Meloni/Stabler, you might want to sit this 1 out. 1 last note-I was THRILLED to see Det. Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters) return for the Season Finale. Die-hards might remember that he was Munch's 1st SVU partner in Season 1, back in 1999-2000!!! Enjoy!",1349308800,,1645,4.81625441696113

4857843,5,B005Q27DNO,"Wow! Just Wow! As soon as Season 9 ended with the departure of Casey Novak, SVU went downhill fast. Seasons 10-12 gave many episodes that were either horribly written, horribly acted, completely unbelievable, not about Special Victims or a combination of the four. While the season finales were all generally better, they all had at least one of those flaws and paled in comparison to the season finales before it. Now with Warren Leight taking the reins and two new actors (Pino and Giddish) coming in, (It's very relieving and not sexist when there's one more female detective as part of the whole which helps even out the reverse-harem these shows seem to have.) this season gets back on track to become one of the top 5 seasons in the franchise. The cases are good and only 3 episodes are really bad with only one of them (Strange Beauty) being horrible. Considering half of the other seasons had horrible episodes, this is a great change of pace. This also is the first season in SVU that I can remember that had some nice continuity. Many small things that happened in one episode carry over into another (Sometimes much later) episode. And let's not forget that finale. It is the best and I mean the best season finale in all of SVU. It had everything you ever needed with the return of a much more jaded Brian Cassidy, a sense of dread over the whole case and Captain Cragen of all people being framed for murder in an escort service's twisted game. There's no question that season 14's premiere will be the most watched in a while. There are some bad habits though that carry on here. Danny Pino's Nick Amaro is becoming Stabler again with all his marital issues and anger problems (I'd even argue that they are worse that Stabler) and the detectives some times make stupid mistakes, but you learn to accept it as the reality they live in and you wouldn't still be watching this if you hated these things. All in all Season 13 was near-perfect.",1348099200,15,1953,4.582857142857143
4857844,5,B005Q27DNO,"Season 13 of this excellent drama is by far the best season yet of this award winning series.  Mariska Hargitay (Olivia Benson) does some career-best work as the solo leader of a group of aggressive yet beleagured detectives who ply their craft in a world that sees human beings at their worst.  Danny Pino (Nick Amauro) has been expertly cast as her new partner, and his arrival has created a whole new level of complexity and revelation for the characters of the SVU, and watching the progression of Benson and Amauro's professional partnership and personal friendship is both intriguing and compelling.  Whether you have never watched the show before, or if you are a long-time fan, this season is incredibly compelling television and worth every penny.",1347667200,15,756,4.984126984126984

But I think that the lost of Christopher  Meloni has sent  the show in a different  turn of events. It's like  watching  the Chicago  Bulls  without  Michael  Jordan. Christopher  brought  balance  to the cast which is priceless. What ever  differences  they may of had with  his contact  they should  of worked  it out.

4857913,4,B005Q27DNO,"Season Thirteen is the game changer.  Because of the departure of a main cast member, it was hard to tell where this season would end up.  But I think they pulled it off.  Certainly the stories were just as interesting and the new characters were decent.

Law and Order SVU details the special crimes.  Offenses against the elderly, children, and sex crimes.  The tough crimes that no one really wants to deal with.  And it takes special detectives to handle these crimes.  This season was really a smooth everything out after the fiasco of the last season and the shooting in house of a young girl.  The detectives are struggling with a loss of their own and trying to play nice with the new detectives that come as a replacement.  There were some really good episodes in this season too.  ""Educated Guess"" involves a rape in a mental institution, which not only hard to prove, is sad because they cannot defend themselves.  ""Theatre Tricks"" involves witnesses who see a rape happening, but do nothing to stop it because they believe it as part of the show.  And ""Strange Beauty"" involves amputation in a most disturbing way.  All of these are just on the weird side but believable, and kind of scary.  Sure there were a few episodes in there I wasn't thrilled with, like the season finale (although it had a decent cliff-hanger), but largely this season was pretty good.

Characters:

  Mariska Hargitay as Det. Olivia Benson
  Danny Pino as Det. Nick Amaro
  Kelli Giddish as Det. Amanda Rollins
  Richard Belzer as Sgt. John Munch
  Ice-T as Det. Fin Tutuola
  Dann Florek as Capt. Don Cragen

Hargitay on her own is still just as good as Hargitay with Meloni.  She's got the chops to act without him and be just as strong.  And that's lucky for the series.  Belzer and Ice-T are in this series a little more as well, although Florek only bounces in here and there.  The new cast members, Giddish and Pino I'm undecided on.  They did ok, but I never really enjoyed Giddish's character.  Just didn't have an interesting backstory for me.  And Pino I started out really liking but then midway through the series they started writing his character differently and I slowly began disliking him.  I don't mind if they stay in the series of course, but I think they need stronger writing to really get on par with where Meloni was and where Hargitay is now.  In this season, a lot of the bad guys are pretty clear cut, which is unusual.  A lot of times they try to humanize the bad guy to get you thinking, but there are some pretty evil people running around in this season.

It's a violent series although I think it has tamed a little bit.  There are graphic photos, descriptions of rape and other hard topics to wrap your head around and witness.  But as always, they're out there for justice and the film-work is more about the detectives hunting for clues than it is about showing graphic brutal scenes.  Still, it's not one that you let those sensitive to such things watch.  But if you're watching the 13th season, you probably already know that.

The fourteenth season should be interesting.  If nothing else, to see what happened with the last episode in this one.

Just like I think it's stupid for people to give a 1GB capacity player low stars because it can't hold 10,000 songs, it's not fair to give a TV series I don't like a low star rating here. So, all that being said, SVU is a show I can take or leave. It's my wife who loves it and can go through an entire season in just a few days. I can watch a few episodes here and there and it's ok, but I'm more of a Sci-Fi kind of guy. So, my review is more about the purchase experience here on Amazon rather than what I personally think of the series. The purchase experience was very good. I ordered this season as a late Christmas gift and it was delivered as expected, very fast,, the right packaging, ETC. So, for that I give it a 5 star rating. If you want a review on the series itself, there are plenty of well-written reviews both here and in other places on the Intertubes which you can read.",1358899200,,1263,4.015873015873016
4857939,5,B005Q27DNO,"Started watching this series from day one, and got my daughter to start watching it with me. We have ""mom/daughter"" nights where we watch a full disc sometimes. While we REALLY miss Stabler being gone (he's such a hunk!), we're getting used to him being gone. We are, and always will be Law & Order: SVU fans, and are very pleased with this so far. The packaging was great for this item!",1357516800,,387,4.388888888888889
4857940,4,B005Q27DNO,"First many of the people you grew to love are gone from Season 13 noticeably Elliot Stabler.  The replacements are a closer like southern belle and a smooth talking gel haired brute.  The jury is still out on both of them because; their characters have yet to be fully developed.  Whats worse is the gritty filming is gone.  They remodelled the SVU station house and with the old station went the raw filming style that made SVU and the Law & Order Franchise so realistic.  Now all the perfectly lit scenes scream the fact that these are just sets and the acting appears as forced and artificial as the new surroundings.  Because; I love Law & Order I will endure this change but; I don't like it.  Many of the story lines in Season 13 are extremely weak and totally predictable.  The only great episodes in Season 13 are those that lead to the cliffhanger at the end.  This season lacks the sudden plot turns and twists that used to be a Law & Order Staple.  The writing is weak to the point where you don't invest yourself in the pain and struggle of the ""special victims or their families \ friends!""  There are no characters like Lenny Briscoe to liven up horrible situations with his characteristic sardonic wit.  In Season 13 they sucked all the juice and flavor from the series and replaced it with a pale boring mix of people.  The sets look great unfortunately they look very much like sets.  The sets look too damn perfect.  The grunge of the old sets and the somewhat blurred filming style let the viewers imagination fill in the blanks when going to the station or other places.  I must admit the Rikers Island visits look amazingly good as if they are the real thing.  If the Rikers Island shots in Season 13 are sets they completely fooled me they look so bad I can almost smell the urine, mixed with body odor and funk that is ever present in prison no matter how clean the floors are!  Is Season 13 of Law & Order SVU worth buying if you love Law & Order of course buying the set is worth it.  I'd wait for the price to drop because; its just not the best work in this franchise.  Season 13 brought lots of sudden radical changes and the NEW writing, acting and sets just haven't caught up to the QUALITY we fan's demand and expect from Law & Order SVU!  I think Season 13 is and was the shake down cruise for many new changes.  I hope the lighting people and the realism people learned their lessons so the set's look a lot less like sets in the future.  The new Law & Order SVU sets are beautiful but they lack that lived in used appearance that everything in New York City seems to have even when it is brand spanking new.

New York City is Gotham because; no matter what you do to it life in New York has that hurried heavily used look that is just dark enough to let you know you are in THE BIG CITY!  New York City is the uncredited star in every Law & Order Episode.  Prior to the Season 13 instalment of Law & Order SVU, New York had a hardcore charm I enjoyed seeing.  Because of watching LAW & Order my visit to New York City was not shocking at all.  I was ready for the frantic pace and people all in a rush to get their business done.  I was ready for the noise and hustle of a BIG City compared to the slow southern weird charm of Baltimore, Maryland.  New York City is awesome and Law & Order brings out the joy of living in such a huge city with huge buildings and huge egos.  Law & Order brings out the darkest parts of Gotham without losing the joy filled bright lights glitter and glamour of New York City at twilight.  Yes Season 13 is good but not the best offering of Law & Order Special Victims Unit.  The new actors have to grow into their roles then start feeling comfortable in those roles before the L&O SVU franchise regains the polish and tightly written fast paced dynamic action filled scripts we true L&O SVU junkies thrive on.  I took off one star just because; so much is new and still being developed.  Law & Order SVU is still good it's just the sheer number of changes in this one season dragged down quality to a point it clearly showed!  Buy Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Thirteenth Year because; its good but if you can wait for it to get cheaper do so the episodes are not really up to past Law & Order: Special Victims Unit high standards!

UPDATE:...  Season 14 of SVU is coming so be ready!

Oh and by the way, THAT CLIFFHANGER IS REAL LIVE SUSPENSE FILLED ONE HUM-DINGER BABY... I would buy Season Thirteen of Law & Order Special Victims Unit just to have both sides of this amazing unexpected Cliff Hanger!  Season 14 took its time playing out the resolution which was beyond satisfying in my book.",1357344000,5,4670,4.280501710376282
