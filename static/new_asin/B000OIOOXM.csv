There is some questionable language, but we all enjoyed it and love to watch parts of the series over and over again. You can take a week and go back and reexperience the whole thing or just pick two or three episodes to relive a specific moment in time. Like rereading your favorite chapters in a beloved book.
Solty Rei and Roy Revant are our anime heroes and we haven't found any other anime production that has captured our imagination like this.",1197763200,3,528,4.453608247422681

Solty Rei is recommended for thos into more of story than a kick but anime, it does have a med. replay value and a little eyecandy for the masses. This anime is in my Top-15 list so I do recommended it for tho's just geting into the anime world!",1189987200,3,403,4.10126582278481
