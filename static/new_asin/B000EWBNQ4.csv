2542509,3,B000EWBNQ4,"Produced by the Disney Channel in 1990 as part of it's Christmas programming, this musical version of ALADDIN pre-dated the eventual animated movie by two years.  It's based on a popular stage production by the Prince Street Players, with music by Jim Eiler and Jeanne Bargy; and book and lyrics by Eiler.

This version of the fairytale restores the locale to it's original Chinese roots, with Aladdin (played with youthful zest by Brent Sudduth) discovering the lamp with the help of a scheming old magician (Richard Kiley), who aims to exploit it's magic for his own ends.  The lamp contains a Genie (a most charming Barry Bostwick) who bestows upon Aladdin the riches he requires in order to marry lovely Princess Mei-Ling (Susan Egan).

This TV movie virtually screams ""Broadway Musical"", for not only do we get seasoned musical theatre vets Richard Kiley, Barry Bostwick and Susan Egan amongst the principals, but also dance dynamo Donna McKechnie, who all but steals the show with a fun turn as Fatima, the dancing doll.  Directed with flair by former ""Monkee"" Micky Dolenz, ALADDIN will appeal to musical lovers, who'll be charmed by it's attractive score (""Fly My Kite"", ""A Lovely Day in China"", ""Up Up High"", ""Tea Time"") and the overall design of the piece stays true to it's musical theater origin.

Well worth seeking out.",1289260800,9,1333,4.928571428571429

There was no charm or kitsch to hold this almost arbitrary version of the musical together.  The characters simply bounced around from scene to scene.

2542526,4,B000EWBNQ4,I liked this.  To call it a movie isn't exactly correct.  It's more like a filmed play with CGI special effects added in.  Also it isn't exactly the same as the animated Disney classic.  It does have similarities.  I haven't seen the Broadway play so I don't have a comparison.  The actors are recognizable.  I have no complaints regarding the acting.  Also it doesn't fit my definition of a musical.,1443312000,,400,4.614285714285714

2542538,4,B000EWBNQ4,"With Kiley's sinister wizard and Bostwick's whimsical genie, miss-able jokes, fun songs and charming bits-of-business, it is a nice production by talented  p e o p l e.

Just don't expect visual bling, because there isn't any. Which -  sadly  - may be why it has been overlooked or overshadowed by the subsequent Disney extravaganzas named for the same hero.

Myself, I prefer this version to the animated ones. First seen in 1992, it is still a nice  way to spend time with family or friends or by oneself, and the proof is I bought it in 2013.

For more information about the production read both Byron Kolln's and Keith Robey's reviews. Never having seen the original stage production, my enjoyment isn't hampered by Robey's disappointments.

Enjoy!",1401235200,,752,4.866141732283465
2542539,1,B000EWBNQ4,"In 1967 I watched a series of stage plays by the Prince Street Players, Ltd. aired on CBS as specials for that year.  They were very original and beautifully executed productions.  The music was ""orchestrated"" using a true orchestra and the productions stared Will B. Able (1923-1981).  This TV movie was ""based"" on the the Prince Street Players work.  And the word ""based"" should be emphasized.  No, they didn't do any rewriting, but like other stage works the scripts appear to have some alternate scenes from one to the other.

Produced by the Disney Channel in 1990, I thought it would be a decent alternative to the original which I have wanted to see for decades.  Given Disney's reputation, I believed the work would be worthy of my attention.  I have rarely been so wrong.  They did do this as a movie and used special effects for the work -- low quality SFX I must say.  This is a complete departure from the ""Chinese theater style"" that is a major element of the original work.  The role of the ""Stage Manager"" is completely discarded along with the stage narration and stage hands who worked on the stage to make the many stage effects happen.  The stage effects of the original were beautiful, especially with the UP, UP, UP, UP HIGH segment.  There was none of that with the special effects execution in this film.

Richard Kiley, cast as the Magician really doesn't help -- he was a good actor, but given the intended style of the work, he was a wrong choice.  The entire cast is wrong!  Barry Bostwick as the Genie of the Lamp & the Genie of the Ring was horrible when taking Will B. Able's original performance in comparison.  This was supposed to be set in ancient China, yet all the actors are Caucasians wearing Chinese costumes.  They made no effort to even try to look the parts.

Finally, there is the music execution.  With this film, they must have had a limited budget, and it is most evident here.  Instead of an orchestra, they used a synthesizer.  The score was completely ruined!  Some music just doesn't translate from orchestra to synthesizer.  Gone is any feeling or depth to the music -- it all comes out flat.  Even a small orchestra would have been better than what they gave us with this.

A good story and script isn't enough when the execution of the work is done poorly.

I wasted my time with this.",1397001600,,2338,4.5443645083932855
