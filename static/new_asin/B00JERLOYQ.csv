8650307,5,B00JERLOYQ,"Compared to other travel DVDs available for New York City, this one is the best I've found. What makes it work so well is that they divide the city into sections and then detail sights in each section. Certainly helps a first time or returning visitor plan their trip to the Big Apple.
Also enjoyed the information about the memorial in the foot print of the Twin Towers.
This is likely the most up to date DVD on New York City.",1403481600,7,428,4.296296296296297
