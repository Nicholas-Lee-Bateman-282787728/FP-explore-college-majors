that will transport you through the breath-filling beauty that is the
American Southwest.  You will be heightened, soothed and inspired by
the amazing and insightful narration that will draw you ever forward on
your own personal journey.  The melodic musical cords allow you to

3873401,5,B0028RXZYG,"This video is amazingly beautiful and will put you in a relaxed state of mind. The images are SO colorful and captures the true beauty of certain places here on earth. I was deeply moved and find something new each time I watch it. A ""must"" see in my opinion.",1242086400,2,259,4.2
3873402,5,B0028RXZYG,"Perhaps the most insidious drift in our social consciousness during at first the industrial revolution and now the information age has been our growing spiritual estrangement from our own earth. We have elevated rational thought to gain short-term social benefits and shunned our mystical connection with the land we live on. We have paved it with concrete and punched oil wells through its skin to build our economies. Now we have sensed the errors of our ways, but we remain locked in a quest for a rational solution. However, it may well take more than our rational thought to heal the earth from the insults we have visited upon it. We will need both our rationality and our heart sense in this ultimate challenge.

Jan Nickman has created a film, ""Living Temples"", which searches for our lost spiritual connection with the land. David Lanz and Gary Stroutsos have created a score that pulls from ancient connections and energizes for present. Their film does not dictate nor does it preach. It does not romanticize the past. However, it does remind us on some subliminal level, of what we have come to ignore. It does ask questions of the heart. The questions that it asks are the heart sense questions that we will need to heed as we move towards an uncertain future.",1241913600,4,1273,4.760180995475113

8356763,5,B0028RXZYG,"Beautifully done!!! The music, scenery, dancing and all of it was so spiritually uplifting. I found myself in a place of meditation, peace and the Presence of the Lord. Thank you and God's blessings to all who are responsible for this beautiful presentation.",1371340800,,258,5.023255813953488
8356764,5,B0028RXZYG,"This is a powerful video.  Watch it in the ""spoken word mode""; it will inspire you to reassess what you find sacred in life.",1267660800,,124,4.166666666666667
8356765,2,B0028RXZYG,"When I saw the previews of this DVD, I was expecting a spiritual experience and was greatly disappointed.  The photography was excellent.  It appears that the sites were in Arizona.  If I would like to visit these places and experience the energy first hand, I wouldn't have a clue where to go.  It was more like National Geographic than spiritual.",1247270400,,348,4.75
8356766,5,B0028RXZYG,"It is a brilliant display of sacred beauty.  The simplicity of it is breathtaking.  It is powerful in a way that just drew me in totally and I felt a connection in my heart chakra.  The question was asked does the S P heal us?  No, in my opinion it gives us the space to heal ourselves.  What is more powerful than that?

The haunting music is a perfect accompaniment.  The simple but elegant photography doesn't detract from the feeling or knowingness of the ""message"" which you feel rather than hear.  It somehow reinforced to me that I am here for a purpose and God gave me eyes to see beauty while I am here.  And if the land can exist and flourish, so can I!

I came away with a sense of peace - a calmness turned inward, a knowingness or sense that everything is going to be okay.  I love how you tie our atoms together with the past, and perhaps the future as well.  There is an implied responsibility there and I feel like we are ready to take it on.

Everything is a part of us, we affect and effect all.  I feel mindful, courageous, responsible and peaceful, all at the same time.  It is a fabulous journey that you have captured.  Thank you!",1243209600,2,1152,4.215596330275229
8356767,5,B0028RXZYG,"While watching ""Living Temples-Sacred Land"" I felt I was being transported to another level of Consciousness. I felt I was taken into the Theta brain wave, where all things are possible and where instant healing is possible. The Beautiful landscapes were majestic, glorious and I became more aware of my own ancient and eternal self. Watching this DVD expanded my understanding of ancient truths and stilled my mind. I recommend watching ""Living Temples-Sacred Land"" over and over to heal, to connect to your eternal self and/or to quiet your mind.

8356768,5,B0028RXZYG,"I grew up in the southwest and have lived and traveled through many of the places shown in the video.  It has always been a place of comfort, support and healing energy for me and I have been missing it greatly.  Watching this video allowed me to feel like I, too, was touching the beautiful rust colored walls, walking the sandy floor of the desert, exploring the vastness of the hills and curves of the ancient structures.  It brought many moments of deep sighs of joy coming up from within me, bringing great peace.  The music, the cinematography, the dance, narration and images were so wonderfully woven into the texture of the land that I feel it completely evokes the beauty and transcendent experience of walking on that land.",1243123200,2,734,4.666666666666667
8356769,5,B0028RXZYG,"I found watching Living Temples to be very soothing - I have been to quite a few of the places and so it was sweet to see the land forms and colors in this format.  My favorites were the desert sequence with the sand dunes and the cliff dwellings with the pictographs. I could look at those ruins endlessly!  I will watch it again, I am sure!
