This is Tiger's only major win NOT available on DVD.  Even with his personal issues at the time, it would have been a huge seller.  The quality is lacking on VHS certainly, but an excellent video that deserves to be in golf fans and Tiger fans DVD libraries - get it done USGA!",1396656000,,457,4.416666666666667
8361931,5,B0000507Q8,"If you are interested in golf enough to buy a video, you are interested in seeing the best golf.  This video showcases the World's #1 golfer, Tiger Woods, at the top of his game.  Use a jog-shuttle feature on your VCR to slow down golf's best swing. (If you don't have a jog-shuttle feature...get a VCR that does.) Educational, inspirational, positively amazing golf.  Is there another reason that you are considering buying a golf video?",974937600,7,438,4.8133333333333335
