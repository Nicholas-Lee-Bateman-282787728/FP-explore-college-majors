8030682,5,B0002Q9VVG,This show is definitely unique and enjoyable. There is a story here for the protagonist and at the same time the viewer themselves. It will pick at your mind make you think about your own situations in your ordinary or not so ordinary lives and make you pause to reflect upon the. I am very happy to know that these are available on dvd.,1403913600,,337,4.28125
