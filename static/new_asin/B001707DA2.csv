The part that I could make it through was some retired-looking non-scientist person sitting at a desk and rambling. Perfectly awful. Please do no help fund this sort of amateur garbage and perhaps someday it will go away.",1460678400,,315,4.962264150943396
8326153,4,B001707DA2,"Overall, I found this DVD interesting, considering that I found nothing else on the market (I am a novice). I just wish the ""Fossil Cleaning"" part were more detailed. This is a home-made video (this is at least my impression), so the quality is not always 100%. In addition, they film on one specific location in the US, Utah, I think. Yet, I was able to learn something from it.",1327190400,,379,4.428571428571429
