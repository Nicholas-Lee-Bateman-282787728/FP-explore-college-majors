5980238,5,B00FEI085A,"Great messages, good animation, kids loved it.  My kids were singing the songs jumping around enjoying it.  The stories are simple messages that my kids were able to relate to the corresponding Bible messages easily.",1399248000,,216,5.142857142857143
5980239,5,B00FEI085A,"Finally--a high quality kids series so well produced that it will captivate both kids and parents alike.  As an early fan, I would encourage anyone looking for safe and entertaining family entertainment to bring Iesodo into your family.",1392249600,,236,5.2105263157894735
5980250,5,B00FEI085A,The grandchildren love the movie.  Looking forward to buy more from the Iesodo dvd collection.,1417651200,,94,5.266666666666667
5980251,3,B00FEI085A,Nice message but a little too veiled for younger children unfamiliar with the scriptures.,1417219200,,89,5.428571428571429
5980252,5,B00FEI085A,Part of a package deal. Kids love.,1409011200,,34,4.0
5980253,5,B00FEI085A,"Having grandkids we like to give them a good Bible base teaching and this DVD is one of the best method for kids to learn, is fun and they love it. I recommend this DVD to any parent or Grandparents with interest on the kids Christian development.",1407110400,,247,4.276595744680851
5980254,5,B00FEI085A,Excellent!! Kids learn in a variety of ways- Iesodo teaches in the truths of the Gospel of Christ.  Proud to support!,1407110400,,117,4.571428571428571
5980255,5,B00FEI085A,I highly recommend this series for all.,1406332800,,39,4.714285714285714
5980256,1,B00FEI085A,"Again, it twists Biblical stories that is a concern in and of itself. Biblical stories are interesting as they are whether for a Christian or non-christian. Why change it?",1401753600,,171,4.931034482758621
5980257,4,B00FEI085A,I loved the bible truths being taught through the characters but it was hard for me thinking of Iesodo as Jesus. God is never explicitly mentioned but is referred to throughout the video. This movie works for believers and emerging believers. I'm not sure how it will go over with my adamant non believing grandchildren but I want to have them watch it.,1401148800,2,353,4.619047619047619
5980258,5,B00FEI085A,"Got ""Believe"", ""Faith"" and "" Love"" for my granddaughters, ages 2 and 3.  They love the birds and learning, ask a lot of questions.  Very creative.",1399852800,,146,4.576923076923077
5980259,5,B00FEI085A,Our grandchildren loved it and so did we - so nice to see gospel related stories made especially for children,1399248000,2,109,4.5
8614842,5,B00FEI085A,My son loves Iesodo,1513814400,,19,4.0
8614843,5,B00FEI085A,"We own all the Iesodo movies. We keep them in our van and every day, really every single day the kids want to watch one of them.",1493337600,,128,3.7777777777777777
8614844,2,B00FEI085A,I found it odd - I would believe if someone/child or not that had no previous Bible experience would have a hard time following this.  My 8 and 6 year old liked it but they go to a Christian school so they're constantly told stories from the NT and it clicked for them.  My husband and myself thought that if someone with very little to no knowledge of Christ would have a hard time piecing it together to God.,1459036800,,410,4.177215189873418
8614845,5,B00FEI085A,Love these DVD's !,1448236800,,18,3.75
8614846,4,B00FEI085A,"I don't have the DVD, so I can't comment on the film and sound quality of this product. I like animation; I decided to watch this on Netflix and it looked and sounded good. Iesodo: Believe has two animated musicals (The Gathering & Believing Is Seeing) that teach about trusting God, and having a positive outlook in life. A nice film choice for homes and Sunday school classes.",1433894400,,378,4.573529411764706
8614847,5,B00FEI085A,"We bought all of them, we love them all, the songs are wonderful and the messages help toddlers to understand a lot of things! Super recommend",1431216000,,142,4.5
8614848,5,B00FEI085A,Great animation and very entertaining for my 2 and 4 yr old!,1430179200,,60,4.083333333333333
8614849,1,B00FEI085A,I bought this for my toddler. It's very slow moving and the stories are very weakly put together. The animation looks nice but that's it. The dialogue and songs had my husband and I rolling our eyes at each other. It was so saccharin.  It made me uncomfortable seeing Jesus depicted as a bird also.,1425427200,,298,4.418181818181818
8614850,1,B00FEI085A,This movie TOTALLY STINKS!!!! I have NEVER seen a more PATHETIC and LAME animated movie!!! The animation is TERRIBLE!!! The actors REAK and when they start singing the songs I just have to leave the room!! The movie is pointless if all it does is make what to run up to the television and turn it off two seconds into the movie!!! Someone needs to tell the people who make these movies to quite wasting their time or make a worth while movie.,1421193600,,442,4.337349397590361
8614851,4,B00FEI085A,Great series! Great message!,1421107200,,28,6.25
