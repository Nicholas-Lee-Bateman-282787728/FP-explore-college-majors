3726995,5,B001O4C6K8,"If you are a big James Burke fan, be sure to check out 'Apollo 11 - A night to Remember"". This documentary recaps the original broadcasts of the Apollo 11 moon landings aired on the BBC. James Burke provides helpful-and sometimes hilarious-demonstrations of spaceflight technology, experiencing zero gravity, and by wearing a the spacesuit the same as the ones used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin for walking on the Moon. I watched this show with my two young sons who absolutely loved it.

James Burke is also famous for the series 'Connections' and 'The Day the Universe Changed' which are the best documentary series ever made in my opinion. Back in the 1990s both series were aired on The Learning Channel (TLC), and it was at this point I originally saw them. Both of these series should be required viewing in high schools and universities. The message they present never ages, which in itself is amazing for a documentary.

James Burke is an excellent presenter (with a great sense of humour as well) who keeps you interested all along the way. To better understand the world we live in today, and how we all got here, I strongly recommend both of these series. You will never tire of watching them. You will not look at the history of science and technology the same ever again.

I have ordered the sequel series 'Connections 2' and 'Connections 3' as well. I will be reviewing them once I have gone through both series.

James Burke is also the author of several books, from both these series and other topics as well. Be sure to check them out.",1337472000,3,1557,4.650909090909091
3726996,5,B001O4C6K8,I very much enjoyed this DVD and added it to my Apollo video collection.  The coverage provided by Sir Patrick Moore and James Burke is excellent.,1327276800,2,146,4.615384615384615
3726997,3,B001O4C6K8,"Since I am a fan of the work that James Burke has done for television, I found his surviving filmed segments the best part of this DVD.  It is too bad if his in-studio video explanations got wiped.

Most of the rest of the DVD's running time covers the lunar landing and walk, which is interesting in itself, but needs a more well rounded introduction and epilogue.",1318032000,,365,4.432835820895522
3726998,5,B001O4C6K8,"I was quite looking forward to this title as it would give a different perspective on the Apollo 11 moon landing from the standard NASA stock footage videos that are out there. Little did I know how good it would actually be.
Most of the actual footage in this DVD is black and white taken directly from the live feed that the BBC broadcast. Most DVDs give you Neil Armstrong coming down the LM ladder, his first step on the moon and maybe a couple of more short clips. This DVD contains a good 45 minutes or more of Neil and Buzz's moonwalk, a lot of footage which I had previously not seen (I have most of the DVDs relating to the Apollo program).
There is also footage during the voyage to the moon that I have not seen anywhere including a tour of the LM and command module (in color).
Also on the DVD are interesting asides like a presenter taking off the spacesuit and showing you all the different pieces that make it up.
Overall a worthy addition to any Apollo or NASA fans collections.",1297209600,7,994,4.320855614973262
3726999,4,B001O4C6K8,Interesting look at the first moon landing from a British perspective.,1289865600,,70,5.454545454545454
3727000,4,B001O4C6K8,"I have seen most of the Apollo 11 documentaries made in the last several decades, but, amazingly, ""Apollo 11 A Night To Remember"" unearths some archival material (mostly from the BBC) that I had not seen before. It is a charming production, even though it's not particularly elaborate. I think of this as the British perspective on Apollo, and personally far prefer it to the Walter Cronkite-intensive material most commonly seen in the US.

The special is hosted by noted British astronomer Sir Patrick Moore, who was early to arrive in the business of covering the lunar program, and features commentary by the great James Burke, who is always interesting, and is better at explaining complex things in simple terms than most anyone. I must admit that the modern footage of Moore (complete with a very aristocratic monocle) is a bit jarring in the way it's edited in to the final product, nonetheless, his observations are spot on.

There is a lot of black and white footage in the film, much of it grainy, but that's obviously a problem with the source material. My favorite segments in the documentary by far were of James Burke demonstrating various things. His ride in the zero-G ""Vomit Comet"" is amusing, but his tours of the Command Module and his explanation of the EVA suit, including modeling it and doffing it for the camera make a very complex piece of equipment much more readily understood than reading about it and looking at diagrams.

Aside from the jarring edits between archival footage and the modern Moore footage, there are a few other detractors in the production: the film spends a lot of time on the surface during Armstrong and Aldrin's EVA, which is great, but much of the time is of comparatively trivial technical events (unspooling the cord for the television camera, etc.) while it could have been better used elsewhere. This was driven home by the abrupt end of the film: after spending a long time covering relative minutiae of the EVA, after ""Eagle"" enters lunar orbit for rendezvous, the film just ends with a note that since Apollo 11 other missions also went to the moon. I think it would have better had they spent less time on the details of the EVA and spent at least a bit on the journey home, recovery, quarantine, and historical perspective of the mission.

Overall the DVD rides the line between four and five stars, but I settled on four, as the editing and abrupt conclusion were rather jarring. Nonetheless, I highly recommend ""Apollo 11 A Night To Remember"" as it has a different viewpoint than is commonly seen, and the archival footage, and especially the material with James Burke makes it hugely worthwhile.",1276473600,5,2660,4.801310043668122
3727001,5,B001O4C6K8,"On this side of the Atlantic we are well acquainted with the news coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing which occurred nearly forty years ago now in the form of the Walter Cronkite coverage for example. But how did others around the world view that amazing feat? Well here's a chance to do just that.  This DVD which originally aired in the UK in 2006 as part of the famed and long running science fact series The Sky At Night, from the perspective of the coverage of UK's famed BBC.  It is an intriguing and even captivating documentary experience to say the least.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about the documentary is the BBC footage itself. Due to a BBC policy of the 1960's and 1970's the BBC regularly destroyed or wiped footage it saw as unnecessary (including much of the 1960's episodes of Doctor Who for example) in order to save  valuable storage space. As a result of that policy sadly destroyed materials included virtually all of the BBC's twenty-seven plus hour coverage of Apollo 11 for reasons that boggle the mind. Thankfully audio recordings were taken by average people of that coverage and it is those recording when coupled with the original live TV transmissions saved for posterity on this side of the Atlantic and filmed clips inserted into the live coverage that make up the bulk of the 1969 footage used here. The reconstructions of the coverage are an amazing feat and while it might not be the coverage in exactly its original form it is still fascinating viewing and listening due to its alternate perspective.

The alternate perspective's biggest highlight, outside of the reconstructed BBC footage, is BBC reporter James Burke's filmed segments which makes up the bulk of surviving material. Burke's segments include a section on the escape tunnel and bunker that would have been sued by the astronauts in the event of an emergency with the Saturn 5 rocket which includes a rare look at the bunker itself (which is something completely new that I haven't seen anywhere before). There's also a guided tour of the command module, Burke's experiences on NAS's Vomit Comet plane used to simulate gravity and even Burke trying on one of the suits similar to the ones worn on the Moon. Burke's footage is both insightful (such as in the emergency situation segment) and even humorous at times (the Vomit Comet being a fantastic example).

Then there's Sir Patrick Moore. Moore, a world famous astronomer and host of the BBC's The Sky At Night, was one of the BBC's main presenters during the original mission and he not only hosts this documentary but even supplements his own remarks from his perspective of nearly four decades alter (keeping in mind this was originally aired in the UK in 2006). It is Moore who links together the various pieces of material across the two hours with great authority and, surprisingly enough, humor at times. Just as intriguing is the inclusion of a 1960 episode of The Sky At night talking about the first images to come back from the far side of the Moon and a younger Moore's discussions with a fellow scientist on what the Moon's surface may be like some nine years before the Moon landing. It is with Moore as the program's front man this two hour compilation of the BBC's coverage makes for fascinating viewing.

While the story of Apollo 11 is well known it is always interesting to get a fresh perspective on a major event. This DVD is exactly that: a fresh and alternate perspective on what has been called Man's greatest adventure. With great authority and humor it is a journey back in time and across the void of space to an incredible moment in history. If you're looking for a different and captivating viewpoint to that event look no further then Apollo 11: A Night to Remember.",1247616000,11,3761,4.732824427480916
3727002,5,B001O4C6K8,"This DVD is a nostalgic retro-space event for those of an age to remember the moment. It sticks, like Kennedy's assassination, and the 9-11 terrorist attack. Take quick advantage of ordering this DVD and have it on-hand for the 40th anniversary of the moon walk.

WHY THIS VERSION?
The BBC put together this special, largely made up of actual footage of the mission's days from July, 1969. Houston space command video was sent around the world, so the US views are included. What's also added is the British coverage, the BBC presentation, of what they referred to as the height of American technology. Thus, THE BEST OF BOTH WORLD, both sides of the Atlantic.

The BBC coverage begins where the US TV network coverage started, at lift off, July 16, 1969. It carries on to the 20th when ""The Eagle has landed"" and to the Eastern Daylight Saving time, almost at midnight, for ""That's one small step..."".  For the first 2 1/2 hours of Monday the 21st, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong walked the moon (Mike Collins orbited the moon in the command module). The significant footage is on this DVD, including film from the Lunar Module (LM) camera that was not viewable live back in 1969.  The special ends with splashdown on the 24th, but little of that part of the mission, after the moon walk, is included in this DVD.

It is exciting, fun, and almost as suspenseful, to again watch the coverage, as it was 40 years ago. Better for this reviewer, because at the time I was a poor college student without color TV. It brings back the pride and astonishment of the early activity at Cape Kennedy (now reverted back to the original name of Cape Canaveral) and Houston Mission Control.

Presented by Sir Patrick Moore, noted astronomer and BBC personality, it provides educational/scientific insight into the events of the late 1960s.  Also provided is FUNNY, factual, and colorful features from the BBC coverage in 1969 through James Burke, reporter, who's segments included the astronaut's escape slide, a weightless simulation, and an explanation of the space suit, during which Burke disrobes one piece at a time, down to the scientifically produced underwear, highly absorbent (for you know what) which ""works like baby nappies.""  In this bit, Burke looks something like Buzz Lightyear, action figure from ""Toy Story.""

BONUS or SPECIAL FEATURES are:
_____""The Sky at Night"" a segment from Sir Moore's monthly BBC program which has aired since April, 1957. This part aired September 27, 1960 and shows photos of the far side of the moon taken from the Russian Lunik 3 moon photo launch in October, 1959. Interesting conclusions were made then, prior to the American's actual moon landing in 1969.
_____Sir Patrick Moore Biography
_____SUBTITLES for the feature AND for the biography.

Fantastic for schools and teachers. Awesome for those old enough to remember watching the live nighttime TV coverage in the USA.",1243209600,18,2910,4.920408163265306

8329388,4,B001O4C6K8,"This is an interesting perspective about the Apollo 11 mission as it was happening.  It is from the British view instead of the American networks or NASA.

The narrator admits in the show some of the original video was lost and he can only talk about what happened.  This make the DVD less exciting and the reason I only give this presentation four stars.  On the other side, there is a better look about the equipment and history behind the Apollo moon missions instead of just an entire film about ""Go USA"".",1453334400,,509,4.5
8329389,4,B001O4C6K8,"As I have many Apollo 11 documentaries as well as the complete TV transmissions and 16mm film from that flight there was nothing new to me in the NASA footage. But that is not why I purchased this disc. I was more interested in seeing how the flight was covered from the BBC perspective. I very much enjoyed the James Burke sections and of course the seeing the late Sir Patrick Moore in his prime was a real treat.
The only fault I found was that the post production titles that were added when this disc was put together had the wrong days of the week for July 1969. The historical footage begins with the title reading Sunday July 16th. The day Apollo 11 launched, July 16th 1969, was a Wednesday. All subsequent titled days are also wrong, matching the days of the week for July 2006, the year this disc was published.
Despite this mistake I would highly recommend this disc to anyone interested in how this historical event was covered at the time.",1438905600,,953,4.451428571428571
