697864,4,6303593186,"I obtained this DVD (through Amazon.com) from an outfit called Disco Viveros. The DVD is made in Mexico and has the original sound track in Spanish (no subtitles) thus fluency in Spanish is a must. Transfer of the movie to DVD is visually excellent; it does justice to the expressionistic cinematography of Gabriel Figueroa. The sound is fine although there is a little extraneous noise in some scenes. Delivery by Disco Viveros was lightning fast and the pricing very reasonable.

Nazarin is one of the best of Buuel's Mexican movies. Although maybe not at the level of his later work (El ngel Exterminador,  Viridiana, La Voie Lacte, Tristana...) is a moving piece of work excellently acted by the Spanish actor Francisco Rabal and a good supporting cast.

I obtained in the same way another two of Buuel's Mexican movies, Los Olvidados and Ensayo de un Crimen. The technical specifications are the same (no subtitles) and the transfer to DVD is of good, if not outstanding quality (a little less so for Los Olvidados). These two movies (as well as Nazarin) are must-watch. Besides their intrinsic quality they are essential pieces in the Buuel puzzle; it is fascinating to discover themes that reappear in some of his later masterpieces.",1298678400,2,1240,4.951923076923077
697865,5,6303593186,"I love the absurdity and biting humor of Buuel's surrealist films (such as ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" or ""The Exterminating Angel"", to name two). Other, earlier works (like ""The Forgotten Ones"", about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in Mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message.

However, I believe it is ""Nazarin"" which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer. While it's true that it's brimming with irony, it nevertheless reveals a side of Buuel that would appear to be intrigued by the solemnity of the spiritual quest. Here, while the director (quite typically) throws countless jabs at the Catholic Church, he also appears to show, surprisingly, a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and its practice of selfless love.

What?? Luis Buuel praising a Jesus-like figure?? I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue... that is, until I watched ""Nazarin"". My appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following Christ's example in a society infested with meanness, ignorance and sin; but he also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness. Without a doubt, by the end of the film I was looking up to him and not down on him.

Some would argue that Father Nazario's doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values. (Alas, if he can't do good in this world, who can?) But I would say that this 'flaw', his frustration, precisely makes his character all the more heroic, because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be. And who says the priest wouldn't eventually emerge from that 'dark night' and regain his confidence? Perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey.

I recognize in Buuel the aggressive, self-professed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social awareness; but after having watched ""Nazarin"", I also sense a certain warmth and maturity that's not so evident in his other work.

For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend watching his short film ""Simon of the Desert"" (also made in Mexico, several years later). It deals with a similar subject matter, only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style.",1287187200,5,2326,4.984536082474227
697866,4,6303593186,"Spanish director Luis Buuel career spanned almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. Arguably, his best films were those he made during his exile in Mexico - from the late forties to the early 60s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets, and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences, yet he somehow managed to make interesting, thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time. This movie is based on a novel by Spanish author Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the setting is now early 20th century Mexico instead of early 20th century Spain. The protagonist, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by Christ. The question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible, without incurring in the hostility, incomprehension and mockery of your fellow human beings. As it happens, he suffers a lot of indignities, yet he remains stubborn (until the controversial final shot) to this objective. I think Buuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) comes out as admirable. In any case, a great film.",1175904000,14,1254,4.837209302325581
697867,5,6303593186,"Octavio Paz, Mexican poet, writer, and diplomat, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said about ""Nazarin"": ""Nazarin follows the great tradition of mad Spaniards originated by Cervantes. His madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly"". A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) attempts to live by the principles of Christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder. Nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th-century Mexico, offering help to poor and begging for food. His two followers, a murderous prostitute Andara and her sister Beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love, consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road. He ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker.

Bunuel tells the story in a manner of a Christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic, and heartbreaking.

I consider Bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever. I've only seen fourteen of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch, the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor, and his dark and shining fantasies. With great pleasure I am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic-comedy ""Nazarin"" to the list of my favorite films.",1170374400,3,1796,5.043771043771044
697868,4,6303593186,"In the past 100 years, there have been several attempts to film the life of Jesus. I believe that none have been as successful as this masterwork by Luis Bunel.  Understanding that traditional movie biographies set in Roman Jerusalem have been saccharine or melodramatic  Bunel updates the story to 19th century Mexico. (For some reason, the cinematic Jesus story works better when the time and costumes are changed...see, for example, the Tom Hanks Movie ""The Green Mile"" which portrays a black Christ-like figure)

What I liked about this move is the convincing way in which the Christ story is retold.  Jesus, (or as he is now called) Father Nazario, cares for those who are sick and prays for them.  Should the person remain ill, nothing is said;  but if the person recovers, Father Nazario is celebrated for bringing about a healing miracle.  Like the original Jesus, Nazario is cruelly executed by the authorities who misunderstand his actions.

  The best scene is the one in which Father Nazario does farm work along with other Mexicans but unlike them, seeks merely to be paid enough for his daily sustenance.  This angers his co-laborers who feel threatened by a man who does not ask as much as he can get from the bosses.  Only the outcasts seem to understand Father Nazario's gentle message of giving and tolerance.

  There is noble grace in Father Nazario's love for the common man and the downtrodden.  This Nazarite is not potrayed as the Son of Man who can turn water into wine or walk upon water.  Instead, his miracles are those that anyone dedicated to practical compassion can do.  If someone wants to get a handle on what the historical Jesus may have been like,  Bunel's characterization of Father Nazario is a good examplar.",1121644800,4,1748,4.824915824915825

697870,5,6303593186,"The sad news spreads that you have left this planet, Ofelia Guilmain, at age 81.  Born in Spain, you became a naturalized Mexican in the 1940s and embarked on a stellar career on the stages of Mexico City and provinces and in a series of Mexican films, among them several by the Spanish emigre Luis Bunuel.  We recall you best of all in NAZARIN, as the sometimes cynical, sometimes credulous landlady of the inn where Nazarin stays.  As Chanfa, Ofelia Guilmain's acting in what might have been a rote part shows you once and for all that there are no small parts, just small actors.  The wronged girl who finds herself pregnant tries to hang herself from a beam in the ceiling.  In a typical Bunuel set-up, the beam snaps and the girl lives.  Sobbing, on the floor, she looks up startled as she is discovered by Ofelia Guilmain who smirks and comments on ""if you wanted to kill yourself, you should have found a better beam,"" a wry comment on the virility of the girl's cowardly suitor. Chanfa provides the note of the ""real world"" in contradistinction to the saintly impulses of the tortured priest, Father Nazario.  Bunuel revered Ofelia Guilmain and used her again to good stead in his 1962 epic THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL, and she appeared in several classic Mexican horror films including most memorably THE BRAINIAC, where, as the wife of a foundry owner she becomes the victim of the Terror Baron's revenge (warning, this is a pretty gruesome film).  In person she was lovable, courageous, modest about her amazing career.  She kept on working right until the end.  Lovers of Bunuel will miss her, but we know that in NAZARIN you light up the skies of realismo with your passion, Senora Guilmain.  Viva Ofelia Guilmain!",1105660800,5,1723,4.71

7852270,5,6303593186,"Review: Nazarin (1959). Mother Teresa spoke of her moments of loss of FAITH (its paucity: DOUBT). To contemplate good and evil would itself be judgmental. But to feel, think and live acts of faith is human, personal. I knew a great man who struggled with the weight of his public persona and the Man he was, where mysteries and mysticism did not abide. Catholicism puts great stock in Faith, Faith in the Mystery, the dogma. His bare feet, his meager diet, his ""look at the birds"" were starting to wear thin. Like Buddha he made the happy mistake of venturing outside his comfort zone. He discovers women followed him, a cute allegorical device, and he might have been attracted to one of them. We now this because Buuel made the point of having them pass each other, each unaware of the other. Suggesting the opposite was true. He wanted the ""pia"" because he desired it. She is feminine, a poor stand in for the beautiful Beatriz. As for this good and evil. He had no inner battle. Mazarin says while engaging in that great philosophical debate with two prostitutes, As es la vida / Thats life And later his solution to superstition is, Reza / Pray."" Remember what does prayer entail? Altogether: FAITH. Scorsese made The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) whose themes were FAITH (and LUST thrown in for the box-office) Just kidding  lust desire or passion were vehicles by which this FAITH could be tested. He is not distraught (IMDb) He is calm, there is a glint of happiness, resolve, in his eyes. His faith is restored, but with the certitude that it's OK to be human - ergo the two are inseparable. Of course there is the foreshadowing of his satirical view of religion, neorealist tendencies (better yet let us call it Mexican Social Realism) especially evident in the Indian-Mexican mix of dialects (Exceptional) which produce the funniest of lines, like Andara describing her ""putita"" firend, (Said affectioately) and Buuel saying through the Priest's lines that the traveler also, Tiene su dignidad como cualquier dspota pasado, presente o futuro. Clearly taking a stab at organized religion and dictators of Mexico (Porfirio Diaz). Buuel employed Ignacio Lpez Tarso not just because of his renown voice but because he has always played roles that dignify the Hero Mexican Man that comes to the defense of the downtrodden.

7852272,5,6303593186,"Luis Buuels 1959 Mexican film, Nazarn is one of three Benito Prez Galds adaptations made with screenwriter Julio Alejandro. Together with Viridiana and Tristana the collaboration marks probably the highest peak in the Buuel canon. This is a bold statement to make, but Galds and Buuel/Alejandro make for a perfect combination in their position on religion and the meaning it has (or doesnt have) for Man. There is an eloquent yet deeply complex intellectual rigor to these films which is hugely impressive. Nazarn is usually approached as a typical Buuel scathing dissection of the hypocrisy of organized religion and the way people practice their faith. After all, a healthy anti-religion aesthetic had been in his films from his surrealist beginnings onwards. From the priests and the tablets containing the Ten Commandments being towed across a room in Un Chien Andalou through to the boozy poker-playing priests of The Phantom of the Liberty religion (especially Catholicism) is attacked mercilessly. However, its important to see how important Galds was in shaping Buuels world view. His novels and plays pre-figured Buuel taking almost an identical position of protest against the way Catholicism in Spain had resulted in a centuries-long history of heresy which had stultified the country in an ingrained culture of dogmatic repression. It would be mistaken however, to assume Galds and Buuel were atheistic. Buuel got tired of his remark (Im still an atheist, thank God) being quoted by people and in truth both of them never rejected Mans need for faith. While attacking the dogma of the Spanish Roman Catholic church, both Buuel and Galds recognized this need and throughout their work there are sympathetic characterizations of nuns, priests and those who attempt (usually without success) to lead Christian lives. Such a figure of sympathy is the main character of Nazarn, the Man of Nazareth, Father Nazario.

Nazario (Francisco Rabal) is a Spanish-born priest practicing from a poor hotel room in a dingy quarter of a Mexican city at the turn of the 20th century during the military dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. He embodies the Christian values of love, compassion, forgiveness, humility, non-violence, purity of heart, poverty of spirit, faith and hope. In every respect Buuel makes him an imitation of Christ, following the ideal of the medieval monk Thomas  Kempis (1380-1471) who wrote: He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, saith the Lord. These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of the heart. Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ. This overwhelming emphasis on imitative practice rather than rhetoric dooms Nazario to a life of daily victimization which (because he must always show love and forgiveness) leads to his hotel room being constantly burgled, people using and abusing his person, people helping themselves to anything they want from him, and his involvement with two prostitutes which compromises his position and leads him to flee the hotel, one of them having set fire to it. Most of the film is devoted to depicting the hapless priest peregrinating around the countryside seeking to bring help to various people, but in fact only causing trouble wherever he goes. He first agrees to do construction work only for bread which causes a labor dispute and bloodshed (he is walking away when we hear gunfire). This peregrination deliberately parallels the life of Christ as he bumps into Beatriz (Marga Lpez) and Andara (Rita Macedo) - the two prostitutes who got him into trouble in the first place - and is forced into performing a miracle which saves a child and convinces the two women they have to follow him in the manner of two apostles. Both resemble Mary Magdelene as former worshippers of the flesh turned faith-seekers. Nazario and his unwanted apostles enter a plague-ridden village and try to help a stricken woman, but are told to go away  she wants her husband, not some priest. Sanitary engineers arrive to emphasize the irrelevance of their position. Eventually the police catch up with Nazario for the arson of his hotel room and (it is hinted) his radical Christian teaching and lifestyle (sharing the company of not one, but two whores). Like Christ he is imprisoned, tortured, offered a chance to escape and has to wear a crown (of bandages). It is in prison that the key encounter with a fellow inmate who has protected him from a cruel thug takes place. Nazario thanks him and wants to save him by applying his usual Christian teaching, but the man just says, Look at me, I only do evilBut what use is your own life really? Youre on the side of good and Im on the side of evil. And neither of us is any use for anything. Nazario is forced to admit that his Christian teachings have been a complete failure, the whole film laying down scene by scene the complete irrelevance of his religious position in the miserable, poisoned and cold world of pre-revolutionary Mexico. Even his two apostles are shown to desire him more as a man than as a vessel of Jesus Christ and he is doomed to a lonely trudge along a road with a guard and the receipt of charity (a pineapple from a street vendor) for the first time. The drums on the soundtrack connote the drums of Buuels birthplace of Calanda which started on Good Friday and went through to noon on Saturday in recognition of the shadows that covered the earth at the moment Christ died as Buuel says in his autobiography, My Last Breath. Unlike some viewers who see a positive ending here in which the priest finally learns how to accept charity rather than administering it, for me I think this final image is overwhelmingly negative. It is an image of the death of Christ in Father Nazario, a rejection of Christian teachings and the beginning of a true understanding of the world in which he lives. The ending of Viridiana reaffirms this position.

Father Nazario is a fool in Buuels relentless demonstration of his irrelevance in the real world, but he is made sympathetic by the way his pure belief is contrasted with the hypocritical belief of the official Roman Catholic Church  the main target of Buuel and Galdss attack. When his room burns down he flees first to his friend, Father Don Angelo who politely, but pointedly tells him that his presence in his house is an embarrassment to his mother (he means an embarrassment to him and the church he represents) and that he must leave in plain clothes. Later on his peregrinations Nazario meets a stagecoach whose horse is stricken and a Colonel and a priest are waiting on the side of the road. Nazario offers to help and observes how the Colonel upbraids a peasant for passing by without greeting him and the priest. The peasant has to go back and pass again, greeting in the proper manner. Nazario protests furiously to the Colonel  for him (and for Christ) all men are equal. The Colonel wants to shoot Nazario for his impertinence, but the priest stops him, dismissing him as a heretic priest. This alliance between the military administration and the Church is shown again later when another priest addresses Nazario (with a portrait of Porfirio Diaz on the wall), telling him that hes an embarrassment to the Church and that he will be escorted to Mexico City separately from the other prisoners in order to lessen this embarrassment. Buuels point is that although nave, Nazarios faith is pure, good and worthy of respect. Its the official Roman Catholic Church that is corrupt, non-Christian (!) and worthy only of attack. Buuel doesnt attack Nazario for his naivety. In fact Rabals sensitive performance makes his plight rather tragi-comic in the manner of Cervantes Don Quixote, while its the society within which he exists that is depicted with unflinching harshness. Buuel sets about wringing the neck of organized religion which is a pillar of this bourgeois society which both Galds and he railed against all their creative lives. It is ironic then, that in addition to winning the international prize at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, Nazarn was also nominated by Catholic film critics for a major prize and to this day is considered an important and inspiring contribution to the religious discourse of our time. This of a film which demonstrates the irrelevance of Christs teachings in the world and the hypocrisy of organized religion!

Buuel/Alejandros muscular scenario is supported by a plain and direct mise-en-scne worked out with cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. Each scene is rendered simply with the minimum of fuss to give the impression of a series of Biblical parables playing out before our eyes. The only surrealistic touch depicts Beatrizs erotic desire for Pinto (No Murayama), the man who drives her to epileptic-like fits, eye-lids all a-flutter and body writhing in orgasmic convulsions. Otherwise this is Buuel at his most pure and austere, though compared with Robert Bresson, for example, the film still teems with the visceral energy of everyday life and the human circus with all its hypocritical emotions. Its difficult to find fault with the film, hugely challenging and enthralling cinema as it is, but I have to take one star off my evaluation because of the rough transfer of this Yume Pictures DVD. The b/w images are not ideally sharp and there is blur when the camera pans or dollies across dark backgrounds. The 4:3 aspect ratio is in place with no distortion of the image, but the vertical sides of the image seem to have been sliced away as shown by the opening credits sliding out of frame and many set-ups where characters are squished too far to the edges. Foot fetishist as Buuel was, he wouldnt be happy to see the naked feet of the plague-stricken woman sliced off by this careless transfer! Still, the film is highly watchable and I warmly recommend it to all lovers of cinema. Nazarn absolutely demands to be seen, representing as it does a great director at the top of his game.",1411430400,2,10078,4.900410076157001
7852273,5,6303593186,"I first saw this at a college cinema in the 1970s. The English subtitles were hard to read because they were white on a black and white film. Some of the letters disappear when they were imposed over the white areas of the film. This new version has outlined words in yellow letters. Even if the dialog goes by faster than you can read it, you can always reverse the DVD to see it. Now that is just the technical improvement of this presentation. The film itself is one of the more exalted in Bunuel's catalog. The story concerns a priest who is so determined to live a Christ like life, he gives almost everything he has away without thinking. He begins to help downtrodden people. In his quest to raise them up, He lowers his own status to that of a criminal . Priests and police look down their nose at the would be Christ as if he were a fool. While he tries to administer spiritual aid to a dying woman, all she wants  is to hold her lovers hand while she lays in bed. Another woman who diligently followed him, re unites with her lover. They pass him on the street without even noticing him. The message from Bunuel is love is the answer. Religion seems to have no place in reality.

7852274,5,6303593186,"First and foremost, this review is for the Alters Collection edition (the one with Vive Mexico on the cover), and that edition DOES have English subtitles.

Released in 1958, the film is arguably Buuel's first masterpiece; based on a Galdos novel, it is the story of a Christlike country priest and his interactions with the harsh world around him, with some noticeable similarities to Dostoyevskys The Idiot. That might all sound a bit dreary, but Nazarn is anything but; there is a subversive bite to the film even as it paints a portrait of a completely good man (with a great performance by Francisco Rabal, incidentally). Good acts have bad consequences, bad people become likable characters, and everywhere we see the paradoxical and two-faced nature of mankind. This mixture of morality and perversity would be seen again in Viridiana and Simon of the Desert.

The picture quality of this particular DVD is fairly good; the print itself is sharp and clear, though there are occasional scratches and other defects in the film. There is also some occasional flicker as well, as though it were not quite mastered properly, but this was very minor and barely noticeable. The sound is poor, however, and the translation in the English subtitles is a bit dubious at times.

7852275,4,6303593186,"Based on a novel by one of Spain's most celebrated authors, Perez Galdos, ""Nazarin"" tells of a young, idealistic priest who attempts to live as closely as possible the life of Jesus Christ, giving away all worldly possessions, denying himself even food when he can aid the needy instead, and ultimately going out into the world and preaching by example to mostly ungrateful (and in some cases downright indignant) people. Director Luis Bunuel made the film while in self-exile in Mexico, and although his ""Mexican period"" is dotted with humdrum melodramas and light comedies, this film and at least two others (""Los Olvidados,"" or ""The Forgotten Ones"" and ""El Angel Extermador"" or ""The Exterminating Angel"") illustrate astonishingly the filmmaker's observation that Mexico is the most surreal country on earth.

7852278,5,6303593186,"Luis Buuel`s self-imposed exile in Mexico from 1946-1964 yielded a fruitful harvest, and his films from this period are, arguably, his most organic and economically composed.  The director listed Nazarin, based off the Benito Perez Galdos novel, as a film he felt much affection for, and that affection extended to the character Father Nazario (Francisco Rabal).  Buuel's paternal attachment to this child/film was sincere enough that when the film failed to win the Prix de l'Office Catholique (Catholic Film Prize), he could express a sense of relief.

The saturnine Fr. Nazario lives in a phantasmagoric haze, imagining that he is following the commandment of Christ to ""take up one's cross,"" but only disaster lies in the stations Nazrio visits.  Nazario does not build his house on rock, but on mud.  He keeps company with a menagerie of freaks: beggars, thieves, whores, and a dwarf.  Nazario refrains from bolting his door, despite the fact that his mob plunders his abode daily.  He is relieved of all possessions, save his Sunday best and crucifix.  Thank God for that.  He befriends the suicidal Beatriz (Marga Lopez), whose self destructiveness is birthed from her incessant need for the abusive man who regularly deserts her.

Nazario provides shelter to Beatriz' homely prostitute sister, Andara (Rita Macedo) after she is wounded in a knife fight.  Andara has killed her rival and is hiding from local authorities.  The local Church learns of the living arrangement and accuses Nazario of improprieties.  Beatriz and Andara become Nazario's Mary and Martha, but the paradox of the priest's hypocrisy is that he pragmatically shuns Andara's imaginative qualities, labeling it a ""sickness.""  Yet, Bunuel invests this setup with an inviting sense of irony.  Nazario is himself the product of a delusional priestly calling.  Imagining himself to be an imitation of Christ, Nazario projects a disdain for his own welfare that is not self-contempt, but rather the publican advertising his asceticism.

In this, Nazario is a bland, literal-minded interpreter of Christ' personality. He is unable to comprehend and assimilate the Jesus' quixotic ""that which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the spirit is spirit,"" synthesized with the value of the messianic claim of gifted joy, abundantly imparted.

Nazario's provision of sanctuary for his female disciples results in a house fire.  The loss of asylum and the sanction of the Church catapults the threesome into agnostic stations as they are pursued by the law.  A young village girl is believed to be healed by Nazario, despite the fact that medicine had been administered to the child before Nazario's arrival. The three wayfarers come upon another village, ravaged with the plague.  Nazario seeks to assist a dying woman (in a scene clearly patterned after de Sade's Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man), who refuses the priest's impassioned and persistent offer to administer extremes unction. Rather, her dying desire is for the touch of her husband.  Much to his confusion and exasperation, Nazario's priestly function is rendered impotent.

Nazario's offer to join a road crew and work only for food creates a labor dispute which ends with the workers killing their foreman.  Beatriz' mother accuses her daughter of carnal love for the priest.  Hysterical, Beatriz denies it, collapsing in a frenzy.  Of course, her fervent denial masks truth, which she belatedly realizes, rejecting her savior in favor of her abusive boyfriend.

Caught and imprisoned, Nazario encounters the two thieves on the side of his symbolic cross.  The unrepentant thief beats him.  The penitent thief confounds Nazario, telling him, ""You are a good man.  I am evil, yet neither of us are of any use to the world.""  The wanderer, freed from prison, is offered a choice in the form of manna.  Nazario's hesitant decision justifies Bunuel's placid sympathy for the impoverished padre.

Buuel once said that if proof of the existence of God was available, then his own approach to art and life would remain unaltered.  Simultaneously, if God were proved a complete myth, the aesthetic qualities of Buuel's existential letters remain the same.  Buuel's messages are neither Christian, nor atheist, but a synthesis.  He categorically denies the agendas of the agnostic, the seeker, the devout, and even the Surrealists in Nazarin.

There is reason Orson Welles astutely claimed that Buuel was the most religious of all filmmakers. There is a story (most likely apocryphal--not that it matters), that a male acquaintance ""caught"" the famous atheist philosopher Martin Heidegger genuflecting before an icon.
