8289870,3,B00004RYO6,"Reasonable acting; it's sort of cool to see Richard Burton and Helmut Shwieg reinterpreting James Coburn and Maximilian Schell's role respectfully, despite the numerous plot holes and other shortcomings in this sequel to Peckinpah's genius first film.  My chief complaint was that the English version has less scenes than the German version, which has more dialogue and character sequences and therefore more context.  I say, if you can speak German or read Polish subtitles, watch the German cut because it is better.  But if you need to get the basic gist of the film without the hassle of learning another language, a film that you're only watching to see how badly it doesn't live up to its predecessor, then Breakthrough (English) is the film for you.  Also, its kind of cool to finally see Stransky get what he deserves, but I preferred the more ambiguous ending of the first film.  Interesting side note; according to [...], Richard Burton was so drunk during the production of the film that most days he had to be carried on set.  Ha, maybe not as grim or cool of a Steiner as Coburn, but Burton has his charms.",1273881600,3,1119,4.742268041237113
