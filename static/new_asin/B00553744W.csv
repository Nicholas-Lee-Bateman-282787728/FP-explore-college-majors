8457346,5,B00553744W,"I watched Somebody's Hero with my 8 year old nephew and was pleasantly surprised to find that I was as entertained by it as him.  Unlike a lot of movies that plod on in the beginning with needless exposition, Somebody's Hero sets up the main theme and the action very quickly and cleanly.  No muss, no fuss, and before you know it, you're rooting for the every man superhero whom we all wish actually existed!  The actors are all very good and the guy from Ugly Betty who is the lead was is just perfect for the role - vulnerable but strong.  The personal bonding story between the lead actor and the kid is very well played and comes across as realistic.  The personal drama is a slow burn but it fits in well with the fast pace of the superhero sequences, which also have plenty of comic relief to keep the mood light, especially for younger viewers.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for family fun which will excite the kids but without boring the adults to tears.",1370563200,,983,4.403314917127072

8457349,5,B00553744W,"I truly enjoyed this delightful, family friendly film.  The versitile and always believable Chris Gorham, of USA's ""Covert Affairs"" plays a regular guy who finds himself playing a make-believe hero to draw a traumatized little boy out of his shell.  There is a sweet romantic sideline as well.  Our hero doesn't always triumph, but he is always honest and true to himself.  Well worth viewing.",1344297600,4,393,5.0
