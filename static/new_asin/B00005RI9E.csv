1655509,2,B00005RI9E,"I can't handle the ... girls in this DVD & the instructor guy really annoys me.  I do like the recommendations for workout ""gear""  and that they break down the equiptment required prior to starting the workout, but that hardly saved it.
The other thing is that the girl working out in the front appears to be talking to herself, and it doesn't look like she's counting reps!
However the work out is tough.  But not my favorite.",1048896000,3,427,4.448717948717949
1655510,4,B00005RI9E,"I agree with a previous review about the models.  I have only tried the first workout, and yes, from what I can see, the exercises and ""super-set"" format are going to be effective.  However, you just CAN NOT watch the screen.  These models are really really weird-looking.  My boyfriend thought they were all trans-sexuals. They never smile, they do not look confident doing the exercises, actually they look scared to death!
I will do the routines, but only listen, not watch.
Try the Quick Fix series instead; very professional fitness experts lead the routines!  and they work!",1017964800,16,580,4.938144329896907
1655511,5,B00005RI9E,"I purchased all three Look Great Naked videos (abs, butt and thighs) and they are terrific. In the short time I've been using them I've definitely noticed a difference in my body--especially my thighs and abs. My clothes fit better and my muscle tone has improved. I had used the Firm series for many years, but these videos are even better.
Each tape has three workouts so you can change up your routine and achieve variety. Although the workouts are short in time, they are tough. Expect to work up a sweat during the routine. But don't worry, the results are well worth it.

7952262,1,B00005RI9E,Boring.  The guy instructor counts so slow.  Girls are so unenthusiastic.  Easy exercise.  I wrote down the 3 exercises per routine and just did them on my own.,1514851200,,160,4.607142857142857

7952264,4,B00005RI9E,I love this on dvd (have it on video but it looks bad. Dvd looks a little better but much easier to access and the exercises are old school but great!!!,1465430400,,152,3.935483870967742

7952266,5,B00005RI9E,"These exercises really target the area they are meant to, and are tough but effective. Isn't that why we exercise, to achieve results? Why does anyone really care if the models look bored or are ""weird looking""? Who watches these for pleasure?",1222214400,2,243,4.809523809523809
7952267,5,B00005RI9E,"Yes, this video could be more interesting.  It is quite repetitive.  The repetition is more than likely what makes it so effective because you are building on the same muscles.  Eventually, for the more advanced program, he recommends leg weights and dumbbells.  Overall, I would  recommend this product but not if one gets bored easily.",1210550400,,337,5.054545454545455
7952268,5,B00005RI9E,"I have practically every exercise DVD ever made; I have to say this is the one I grab; especially if time is limited (if you are in a hurry, skip one set) This purchase was well worth the money and more! The reviews I read prior to purchase made me reluctant to purchase, but I took a chance and am glad. Who CARES if the models are smiling or not?? They have incredible bodies and that in and of itself is motivating! If your butt improves instantly (which it will), does it matter who is smiling?! Each section is three exercises, and each is done in three sets with a stretch after each. If you have limited time skip a set, but don't skip an exercise. You won't be smiling when you're done working out, but once you look in the mirror you WILL be! Easy to follow workout. Could have been laid out better (exercises lying down, jumping up, then down again), but it's a minor annoyance.",1183593600,,888,4.291666666666667
7952269,4,B00005RI9E,"As a Professional Trainer, I am a big advocate of home fitness routines. This DVD is pretty good for that reason, it gives you a decent (lower body) workout at home.

About the 'dull' models - that doesn't matter, the information (the exercises, etc.) is what is most important.

A good tool to have in your home fitness toolbox.",1140134400,4,329,4.559322033898305
7952270,5,B00005RI9E,I started seeing results in 2 weeks!  Who cares if the models don't smile! They seem serious to me and appear to be listening to Brians instructions.  They are fit and if the routine looks easy--thats because these girls are in shape--and You out there will be too if you follow the workout.  I advanced to leg weights in 3 weeks and now I can really feel my muscles working! The routine seems like a class and the instructor walks arounds and gives training tips...he is NOT supposed to do all the exercise--thats why he has 4 models do it!,1114992000,4,541,4.39
7952271,4,B00005RI9E,"I like this video. Exercises are basic, simple and easy to do at home. It's very easy to follow, and also has a demostration of the exercises before each workout.
The 12 minutes workouts are extremly motivating for me. It's hard to find an excuse to do not spend 12 minutes on yourself.
And about the models...well...
they are weird, they never smile, they dull and unhappy  but they have great bodies, wich is very motivating.
I don't really like videos were people is jumping, laughing at anything and touching themselves all the time. This video is very simple and clean.
I'll recommend it to anyone who enjoys a peaceful workout.",1074988800,6,633,4.702702702702703
