7479701,5,B016S45JA2,"Back in the late 90s/early 2000's, Cartoon Network was at an all time high; hitting one home run after the next with their list of cartoons, including ""Powerpuff Girls"", ""Dexter's Lab"", ""Ed, Edd, n' Eddy"", and many others. But out of all their benchmark shows, the weirdest one out of the pack was, no question, ""Courage the Cowardly Dog."" Taking place in the fictional town of Nowhere, Kansas, the series was about a dog named Courage, who lived on a farm with his two owners; a kindly old woman named Muriel, and her grumpy husband, Eustace. Unfortunately for the tiny family, their farm seems to constantly be a magnet for trouble of all kinds, including monsters, magic, aliens, and other worldly happenings. So in spite of being terrified all the time, Courage must always summon his bravery to save his family and his home--often with both creepy and hilarious results. (Because remember folks, 'courage' doesn't mean you're not scared--it's doing what you have to, despite being afraid.)

Simply put, this was a horror show for kids, with a wide range of stories with unconventional heroes and villains. You never quite knew what you were in for, be it something cute, funny, or outright disturbing. Although you always knew Courage would save the day, you never quite knew HOW he was going to do it, making each episode filled with constant twists and surprises. The cast and crew behind the show really knew how to use the off kilter animation and artwork to their full advantage, along with music that would appropriately set the mood (often sounding classical and/or very old, unlike the electronic/techno music that seems to dominate most cartoons). It also wasn't afraid to push the boundaries of what could get past the censors, often throwing in dark and/or adult subject matter, but disguising it under a ton of symbolism and metaphors that a younger audience could understand.

After owning the first two seasons, I was thrilled to find out the third season finally saw a release. Included are the next thirteen episodes (meaning two 11 minute cartoons to make up a half hour). I'm particularly excited, considering this was the season that spawned some of my all time favorite episodes, including ""The Sandman Sleeps"", in which the Sandman steals Muriel's ability to rest so he himself can get some shut eye; ""Hard Drive Courage"", in which Courage is beamed into his computer ala 'Tron' (with some nifty CGI effects), ""The Snowman's Revenge""--a funny and heartwarming sequel to an early first season episode, and ""Night of the Scarecrow"", in which a friendly scarecrow tries to earn his keep around the farm by trying (and failing) to be scary. (And if my choices are any indication, it's proof that not all of this show's episodes aimed for scares. Some could be outright sweet.)

Unfortunately, there's no special features what so ever. It would've been nice to have at least a featurette of some kind talking about the show's creation, or the lasting impact it had on the fans. But despite the cut and dry release, if you loved the show, this two-disc set is a must have! Here's hoping they not only release the last season, but start bringing the other Cartoon Network shows onto DVD.",1458777600,10,3206,4.868131868131868
7479702,5,B016S45JA2,"Another courageous DVD, to add to my collection, only need Season 4 and collection complete. Also, one of my favorite shows as a teenager.",1458691200,5,138,4.791666666666667
7479703,4,B016S45JA2,"Call him a stupid dog if you want, but Courage the Cowardly Dog keeps living up to his name by reluctantly conquering his fears and save his owners Muriel and Eustace Bagge from danger.  And there are 13 more classic episodes of the pooch's adventures on yet another 2-disc DVD set such as:

""Muriel Meets Her Match"" - A woman that bears a striking resemblance to Muriel frames the real Muriel for stealing a priceless gem.
""Courage vs. Mecha-Courage"" - A brainiac builds a robot version of Courage and it gets more attention than the real dog.
""Stormy Weather"" - A storm goddess mistakes Courage for her real pet Duncan.  As a custody battle brews between the goddess and Muriel, it's up to Courage to find Duncan and fast.
""The Sandman Sleeps"" - The Sandman needs a good night's sleep, so he steals it from Muriel finding her a perfect specimen.
""Hard Drive Courage"" - Muriel accidentally gets sucked into Courage's computer and Courage goes in there, too, in order to save Muriel.
""Scuba Scuba Doo"" - Courage and Muriel discover a wondrous underwater village where tiny sea creatures live.  However, that same village is under attack and Courage must protect it at all costs.
""Conway the Contaminist"" - A strange old man visits the farmhouse telling Muriel and Eustace the only way to live longer: By being filthy.
""Katz Under the Sea"" - Muriel goes on a submarine cruise.  But Courage discovers the truth behind it from overhearing Kaptain Katz and his plot to blow up the submarine.
""Curtain of Cruelty"" - A weird wall of light engulfs the citizens of Nowhere making them mean and nasty... like Eustace.  Looks like Courage has to find the source of this light and fix this problem.
""So in Louvre are We Two"" - It's a night at the museum for Courage.  Particularly the Louvre in Paris where the Mona Lisa and The Thinker come to life and switch places with Muriel and Eustace !
""Watch the Birdies"" - It's an adventure in babysitting for Muriel and Courage as they keep an eye on a mother bird's babies while she's away.
""Fishy Business"" - A ""fish-onary"" takes the family on a trip where they must live like sea creatures for the rest of their lives.
""Angry Nasty People"" - Remember Benton Tarantella, the zombie filmmaker ?  Well, now he's back from the grave and turns Eustace into big TV star by being mean and rotten.
""Snowman's Revenge"" - That sinister Snowman is suffering global warming.  He decides to make a new arctic home at Courage's home by the use a new freezing gadget he invented.
""The Quilt Club"" - First rule of Quilt Club, you do not talk about it.  Second rule of Quilt Club, you DO NOT talk about it.  Especially when there's a two-headed crone who's actually out to steal your soul !
""Swindilin' Wind"" - When Shirley the Medium get conned by Eustace, she casts a spell on him and Muriel by making them swindle each other.

Interesting fact: Disc one features the last episodes where Eustace is voiced by Lionel Wilson, the original actor, while disc two has episodes where Eustace is voiced by Arthur Anderson who also voices Eustace in Cartoon Network promos as well as the Cartoon Network Racing video game.  And since there's no word on other ""Hall of Fame"" releases of other Cartoon Network shows, I suppose they'll finally make it so after season four of Courage is released on DVD.  But I'm not holding my breath.",1457568000,8,3345,4.618887015177066
7479704,5,B016S45JA2,"Ok, I am just going to say right off the bat.. I do not yet own this, but I pre ordered it.. I know I will love it because I own the first two and I loved the show!!! My child hood consisted mostly of these shoes! Now what bothers me is.. is why aren't the releasing the full series of most of the 90s cartoons.. Ed, Edd, N Eddy got like only two seasons released ( the Thailand imports are scams. )... only one season of Johnny Bravo, one season of dexter Laboratory.. the only full series release was power puff girls!!! I want all the 90s cartoons released! Like now.. I will gladly pay like 150 dollars for each series ! Just RELEASE THEM ALL TO DVD or blu ray!",1455840000,13,665,4.045454545454546
7479705,5,B016S45JA2,"I am very surprised they haven't given Ed Edd 'n Eddy a proper release yet! It was obviously one of their most popular shows and for them to disrespect it is just saddening.

Anyways, at least they aren't disrespecting Courage the Cowardly Dog and are still putting some resources out for the remaining fans.

Hopefully they will do the same for our favorite trio!",1453852800,10,364,4.671875
