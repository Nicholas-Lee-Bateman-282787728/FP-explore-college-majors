8139042,4,B000HEV7SS,"This is obviously not a normal movie.  I don't want to be a spoiler here, but there are no people in it or even objects.  The movie is moving shades of light, gray and black.  Still, it's really good for what it is.  The music that goes with the film is very nice, cagey, mysterious, haunting music.  I watched about 20 minutes of the movie intently then did some reading while the movie and music were playing.  It was very nice for that and I would say I really enjoyed it as a whole.",1317945600,7,486,4.117021276595745
