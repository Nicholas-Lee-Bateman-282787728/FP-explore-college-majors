8389803,4,B0036BN16A,"I can't believe that this film is forgotten by the general public.  I had to buy a region 4 disc to get this in widescreen.  Thank the Muses for this disc!  Any Sherlock Holmes fan will love this.  A beautiful film with scenes shot in Austria and England, and at Pinewood Studios located just outside of London.

We have a comedy full of serious issues - taken seriously.  Women as property:  tie them up and force-feed them drugs then you can take them anywhere.  Hazing and dueling:  a men's club can be treacherous for a psychiatrist with new ideas.  Drug addiction:  friends helping friends stop drugs.  And of course, there is murder.

Vanessa Redgrave is a French ""mezzo-soprano"" and the heroin (pardon the pun) of the subplot.  I have to admit that I was not receptive to the idea of Williamson as Sherlock Holmes, but before the end of the first scene I was won over.  Laurence Olivier is terrific as usual, as Professor Moriarty.  Alan Arkin is superb!  I am not his greatest fan, but this is Arkin's best performance (Yes, I am counting Get Smart.)!  He is fabulous as Sigmund Freud.

PLEASE NOTE:  I was lucky enough to have seen the film in the theater before I knew who Robert Duvall was.  I remember thinking that he was younger and more fit than previous Watsons, but I thought he was very good.  Perhaps he is closer to the character in Sir Arthur's books than other ""Watsons"" are.  Mr. Duvall has since demonstrated his acting prowess as some very strong American characters.  That is why I encourage American viewers to think of him as his British cousin of the same name.  Otherwise you'll never get used to the accent.

Watson is our narrator.  He begins by telling us of Holmes' addiction to cocaine and it is time to stop it.  He and Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother, make a plan to help Sherlock stop taking cocaine.  Professor Moriarty, who is actually a professor rather than the supreme criminal mastermind of other episodes, is talked into helping... and the game is afoot.
Sherlock and Watson follow Professor Moriarty to Venice, but it's just a trick to get Sherlock to Sigmund Freud.  Freud is a recovered addict himself and offers to guide Sherlock through the process.  Mrs. Freud assists while Sherlock goes through withdrawals, Freud and Watson pass the time by going to a men's club. While there, Freud is insulted and threatened by Baron von Leinsdorf and Freud demands satisfaction.  Instead of a traditional duel, Sigmund challenges him to a game of squash.  Both survive (I'm not going to tell who won.) and all is well for the time being.  Sherlock can't be kept inside all the time so Sigmund takes he and Watson to see another patient, Lola Deveraux.  Holmes quickly determines that Lola was abducted and then escaped from her abductors.  Previous to her abduction she was a recovered addict, but she was force-fed drugs by her kidnappers.  What abomination!  It's just what Holmes needs to keep his mind off cocaine.  The three men go off to solve the crime.  Occasionally, Freud takes some pointers from Sherlock on how to deduce.  Holmes sees that a man, Lowenstein, meets Lola's description and they follow him.  It's not long before they realize that ""The Pasha"" and the Baron are involved.  Lola is kidnapped again and the three sleuths pursue the kidnappers.  Someone is murdered.  They catch up with Lowenstein and get some answers.  Soon, the three are on a train chasing The Pasha's train.  Well... I can't tell you the whole story now can I.  Happy sleuthing.

To the industry: get this film ready for Blu-Ray and put in subtitles.  Put widescreen and full screen on the same disc.  Issue it in regions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8!  Make good on the crime.",1276732800,4,3703,4.70625
