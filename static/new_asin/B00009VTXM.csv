It's not CKY2K and CKY3 put on one DVD, it's a collection of CLIPS FROM BOTH VIDEOS. Why did they do this and where can I get the originals on DVD you ask?

Well, it all started with the release of CKY2K. After the success of Landspeed CKY Bam and crew decided to make another skate video, and they did. For the first one they used solely music by CKY and they had the rights to use it because CKY the band are members of the CKY crew. For CKY2K though, they used music by other bands ofwhich Bam did not license the music from. These artists include Rammstein, Bjork, and a few others. This video didn't really get much of a wide release so nobody noticed, but then Bam did the same thing with CKY3. He released that without getting clearence for a lot of the songs and he got a few cease and desist letters from the bands and then they took notice of CKY2K and more letters were sent. Bam was forced to pull CKY2K and CKY3 off shelves and cease production of both DVDs. After that they stopped production of the CKY Box Set (which was still available on CCS.com until December 2005) and released this. My suggestion to you is that you DO NOT buy this and you look for the original CKY box set. If you find it for $128 don't buy it, but I've actually seen it around for like $20 so you could very well strike it big.",1151193600,,1512,4.178082191780822

7993510,3,B00009VTXM,"This is the second CKY DVD I've seen (after #4). Some of the stunts featured here were later revamped; such as the hilarious gay roller-bladers & Raab Himself peeing on an electric fence, but personally I found this version to be much funnier.
Other bits include the guys kicking footballs at passing cars, tying string to a bee, breaking wind in each others faces (fart gags always fare well)& a guy dressed as a bird up in a tree & dropping eggs out of his butt onto the walking stack of hair known as Rake Yohn while he's trying to impress some babe on a picnic (but I guess Rake COULD easily be mistaken for a bird's nest, so you can see the twisted logic in it).
There's also a whole string of stunts having to do with faeces- memorably a guy picking up a dollar bill off the ground that has dookie smeared on it but when the guys let him in on the joke he goes ape. Some people have no sense of humor. Other poop stunts include Raab Himself doing his biz off the top of a four story building after consuming 18 laxatives- even though there is a warning on the box not to take more than 2 at a time!
Inevitably there are also the skateboarding scenes, which I found boring so skaties will raise my rating by at least a star. And of course, no CKY DVD would be the same without old Phil Margera taking a pounding! (But the stuff here is nowhere near as funny as the hilarious stunt of Phil mowing the lawn in CKY4). Man! And you thought Ozzy's family were dysfunctional!
But to cap my review off, what makes this installment special is that it's a pioneering work. It's to JACKASS what THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1919) is to the horror film genre. I just hope the best is yet to come. Check it out. Again I will add that this DVD is NOT recommended for prudes or the elderly. I just hope these DVDs help open the floodgates to more liberal censorship laws in NZ...",1066348800,4,1870,4.226256983240224
