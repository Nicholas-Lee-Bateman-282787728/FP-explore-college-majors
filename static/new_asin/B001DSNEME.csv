3538261,5,B001DSNEME,"If you are a fan of Fred, you'd be a huge dummy not to buy this box set.  My boyfriend and I watch an episode almost every day.  Comedy just isn't as good today as it was back then.  It's a great product for a great price :)",1228262400,,224,3.625
3538262,5,B001DSNEME,"Even after over 35 years,Sanford & Son is still the funniest show ever. Based on the british sitcom,Steptoe and Son(featuring Wilford Brambell best known to Americans as Paul McCartney's grandfather in A Hard Days Night),a show about a cantankerous junk dealer and his long suffering son who was his business partner. Television producer Norman Lear who had a hit with All In The Family(Based on another British sitcom Til Death Us Do Part),bought the American rights to Steptoe then changed the format and lead characters to African American featuring bawdy comedian Redd Foxx as Fred Sanford and Demond Wilson as the son, Lamont.
Although the first season lacks such memorable characters such as Grady and Aunt Esther(who would make their debut in the following seasons),the chemestry between Foxx and Wilson is undeniable magic. The funniest episodes of the season(many were based on Steptoe episodes were We Were Robbed,Here Comes The Bride,There Goes The Bride and A Matter Of Life or Breathe (the scene with Fred entering the set with a surgical mask is priceless).
After the hilarious first season,the second season of Sanford and Son raised the bar considerably,and set the tone for the rest of the show. This season marks the apperence of the classic supporting cast,including Bubba(Don Bexley),Rollo Lawson(Nathanial Taylor),Julio Fuentes(Gregory Sierra)Officer Hopkins a/k/a ""Hoppy(Howard Platt),and of course Fred Sanford's greatest nemesis,Aunt Esther(LaWanda Page).Unfortunately it would mark the end of Melvin(Slappy White),Officer Swanhauser a/k/a ""Swanny""(Noam Pitlik),and Aunt Ethel(Beah Richards).
Classic Episodes includes By The Numbers,The Card Sharps,The Dowery/Sanford & Son & Daughter(both written by Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney),Blood is Thicker Than Junk,and of course Rated X.
Sanford & Son's third season not only debuted Grady Wilson(Whitman Mayo) but boasted many classic episodes including The Chameleon(Blind Mellow Jelly),Lamont, Is That You?(The Gay Blade),Introducing The Three Degrees,This Little TV Went to Market(Guy's Groovy Grabbag),Fred Sanford, Legal Eagle,and many others. Although brilliant, The Third season of S&S was marred by the abscence of Redd Foxx who walked out due to contract disputes. The show carried on for six episodes with Fred Sanford in St. Louis for a funeral as Grady (Whitman Mayo) looked after the place and took care of Fred's over 30 son/business partner Lamont (????).
In the beginning of the fourth,Fred was back(although some ""Grady"" episodes were aired later on),and for the first half of the season the show was back on track with classic episodes, The Surprise Party(Fred's hilarious return home), There'll Be Some Changes Made (Lamont's sensitivity group), The Stand-ins (featuring Scatman Crothers and Billy Eckstine) and The Masquerade Party (Fred's entrance in the gorilla suit is priceless).But by the latter half of the season, the show started to run out of fuel as the plots became more ludicrous, and the show became a former shell of itself. The fact that Foxx's new contract may have given him a huge ego as he had more creative control of the show (as well as Demond Wilson's own contract disputes and substance abuse problem).
By the time the fifth season of Sanford and Son came around,it was obvious that the show was on it's last leg. Despites some funny episodes (Earthquake II,Steinberg and Son,My Fair Esther, Sanford and Rising Son, The TV Addict and The Director featuring George Foreman) we get a ton of stinkers (Sergeant Gork, The Oddfather, Can You Chop This?, Greatest Show in Watts and A Pain in the Neck). The supporting cast becoming more prominant, as season five also introduces Janet,Lamont's new fiancee, Hutch and May Hopkins (Hoppy's Mother) , two resident of the new Sanford Arms. Even with the new recurring charaters,it's obvious Sanford and Son was getting tired.
By the time Sanford and Son returned for it's sixth season in 1976,not only has issue oriented sitcoms(All In The Family,Good Times) lost their foothold in the Nielsons and replaced by more family friendly shows (Happy Days,Laverne & Shirley,What's Happening!),but the show's quality had erode to the point that it's audience had tuned elsewhere. After four high rated seasons,S&S sucumb to poor writing, gratuitous guest stars(like celebraties would visit a junkyard), and cheap ratings catching gimmicks (the Hawaii episode and the Redd foxx lookalike contest).
At the end of the 6th season,the two stars quit,and the next season the show was retooled as The Sanford Arms featuring Teddy Wilson along with the supporting cast. The show only lasted few episodes before it was officially cancelled. In 1980,Sanford premiered sans Demond Wilson. Lacking the chemestry of the previous show,it was cancelled after a year a half later.
The first four seasons were undeniably the best. The show was plagued later by ego trips,salary disputes,and Foxx's walkout. Even after Foxx's return,weak writing and bufoonery lost veiwers. Even with it's erratic history,S&S first four seasons was the greatest African-American television comedy,if not overall",1228003200,134,5123,5.437185929648241
3538263,5,B001DSNEME,"Its been many years since I've seen any of the Sanford & Son shows, this is another great comedy series that vanished into oblivion years ago, but for practically nothing, you can own the entire collection, a little piece of history, every show, 136 episodes, all put together by SONY (Thank God its not one of those cheap second rate recordings that are out there for difficult to find titles) Redd Fox has that dry humor thats fun to laugh at, his jokes seemlessly fit into the scripts of the shows, he pokes fun at everything and he manages to keep off racial issues or sensitive matters that can excite hateful feelings. This show in my opinion, blows away the Archie Bunker mentality we all know from All in the Family or the Jeffersons, and makes the viewer feel less threatened or intimidated by racial issues. I enjoyed this series mostly because of the humor and the brevity of the shows. Redd Fox was a great comedian, one that comes along very rarely. Lamont, his son and partner on the show (Demond Wilson) is not a comedian of the Foxx calibre, but he's a good side kick for Redd Fox and complements Foxx's humor, as do the other characters, Aunt Esther and Grady. Each episode without commercials runs approximately twenty minutes, one or two episodes during dinner keeps me occupied and gives me my fill of comedy for the day.",1228003200,,1341,4.591666666666667

3538265,5,B001DSNEME,"I am a big Sanford & Son television viewer.  In today's syndication market, I have increasingly purchased the shows I really enjoy on DVD,--simply because the networks cut so much of the original show out to add more commercials.  In another 10 years, they'll be playing the opening and closing credits with a ""you big dummy"" thrown in as the show.
My one question is: Do these shows play consecutively; or does one show play and then you have to highlight another show and then press ""play"" for it to run.
Does anybody know how this format is going to be set up for this set?
Any information would be appreciated.

3538266,5,B001DSNEME,"Fred G Sanford is the funniest character I've ever seen on any television show. Sanford & Son has countless classic episodes, I could watch many over and over. Everyone in the supporting cast, Lamont, Aunt Ester, Grady, Julio, Skillet, Bubba, and all the rest are all great.  Fred easily takes the cake here, but I often times find myself laughing at Smitty & Hoppy (the 2 cops) Hoppy's attempts to connect with the black people of Watts - always failed and always got a chuckle out out me.  Fred's interactions with Lamont were typically great, and his battles with Aunt Ester - CLASSIC!
To have one Mega box set with all 6 seasons is epic, even if you can buy them all individually. There are a couple not so great episodes, especially some of the ones without Fred. But there are so many outstanding ones I can't be mad at this collection. And no matter how many times I see Fred break out into one of his fake ""this is the big one! I'm comin to join ya Elizabeth!"" I still smile.  Redd Foxx was a legend and he played Fred G Sanford perfectly.

I especially love the episode where Fred accidentally gets 2 checks from Social Security, Lamont being the reasonable, honest one begs his father to call and report it.  NOPE!  In typical Fred fashion, him & Grady jet out to Vegas and proceed to blow both checks haha.  He returns home and a man from the Social Security office shows up saying there's been a mistake.  Fred hit's his que for a fake Heart Attack perfectly thinking he's been caught. But instead the man says they didn't send Fred a check at all and apologizes while giving him a 3rd check.  All the while Lamont's eyes are rolling in the back of his head.",1220486400,10,1670,4.413680781758957

3538278,5,B001DSNEME,"This TV series was made when the world wasn't full of overly sensitive people!! This is whats missing in the world and why we are living in the times we are. People today focus too much on making words have more meaning than they have and not focusing on what is being said. Example, I was reading a review online of a room, the person was asking if its set up to accommodate very large people, she asked if it was a normal size door opening, everyone jumped on her not to use the word normal to describe the door and she should use the term standard, meanwhile her question wasn't answered. (The meaning of normal is conforming to a standard)
So if you are one of those people (did I just say those people...yes, I did, lol) who nit pick words to create drama, then this series is not for you. You will hear ya big dummy, you heathen, Puerto Ricans ruin the neighborhoods (Im Puerto Rican and find this hysterical as it is a back at ya for when people say blacks ruin the neighborhood), if you take offence to are you saying he is portraying homosexual attributes....no, Im saying he may be turning into a sissy; if you misread that and thought he said homosexuals are sissy then you are one of those sensitive people because when he was asked yes or no is he portraying attributes the answer was NO, if the answer was yes, he is turning into a sissy then you could say he was calling homosexuals sissies, but he does NOT, so if thats what you understood then save yourself and try to find another comedy, this one will not be to your liking.
But, if you're looking for tell it like it is comedy, politically incorrect way of speaking from back in the good old days, and playing on the different stereotypes (one episode Fred was reporting a fake robbery, when asked what the subjects look like he said it was four white dudes, this is what I mean by playing on different stereotypes) then order this today!!!",1521417600,,1910,4.367977528089888

Season 1 is in order.
Season 2 starts with Episode 14
Season 3 starts with Episode  6
Season 4 Starts with Episode 11 and episode 24 is actually on Disc 1 of Season 5
Season 5.... they managed to get the correct episodes and order, but Episode 24 of Season 4 is on Disc 1
Season 6 is Close... but no cigar

Really good show... but if you like to watch these shows in order like I do, just check IMdb and watch them that way.  It's terrible that you pay for something and then have to work to enjoy it.

Choosing some performers who were obviously everyday people with little or no professional acting experience gave the show a special quality.  Very, very, funny.  Nothing like it on TV since and as much as I wish there could be, I doubt there will be.  Redd Foxx created a character as unique as W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx.  And equally as funny.

Second star removed because many episodes are out of order. Generally that doesn't matter on a sitcom. However, in the case where Redd Foxx left the show over a dispute and then later returned, the ""welcome home"" party for Fred Sanford should have been at the beginning of Season 4. Instead, they mixed up the order of those episodes, so Fred's ""welcome home"" party happens after episodes where he was already back on the show.

One major plus is that this set is NOT edited. I've read other claims that the ""N Word"" was edited out. No ton my discs.

So, if you don't mind video that stretched out of proportion, and if you don't care about the order of the episodes, then go for it. The two above reasons are not deal breakers. They're just annoyances.",1506384000,5,918,4.479041916167665
3538370,4,B001DSNEME,Having all the discs stacked upon one another is kind of a pain but it's a trade off to save some money. The nostalgia was there but not quite how I remembered it.(I was a young child when this was originally on the air.)If it's selling for under $18.00 or so go ahead. If the price edges up to $25-$35 then wait. Check often. 1 day it was $16. I waited. Checked again & it went to $24. Have a laugh *if* you can get it cheap.,1506038400,,426,3.9080459770114944

3538372,5,B001DSNEME,"I'm not going to tell you about the show; if you're this far in, you know if you like it or not. This set was a steal at less than $25 for the entire series. It's more for my mother than myself, though I enjoy it also. She only had one season on DVD and  another still on VHS (yea, she doesn't even have a VCR anymore).

The package arrived about a week and a few days after I ordered it, bundled with other orders. Still in the plastic. They call this the slim case, and I'd hate to see the normal case because this is only relatively slim. See the photos. After I pulled the plastic off, I had to make sure I didn't tear up the case opening it. There's a small tab slotted into the box to  open/close it. BTW, they crammed all those episode titles onto that box. Not smart when the target audience's eyesight is failing but to save space, OK. Pull out the discs - BUT WAIT; THERE'S MORE!! Plastic, that is. Plus cardboard on top of the discs. OK, that's fine. The  discs are protected and unblemished. The cardboard leaves a few fibers behind bit OK. The plastic case that the discs are held in, be careful. The bottom edge, if you hold that and not the top, seems to be able to inflict paper cut damage. That case does have ridges on the inside which hold the discs in place but can make it slightly frustrating to get them out. Just press on the round part in the middle if that happens.",1505692800,,1391,4.140740740740741

3538377,5,B001DSNEME,"Do I start with ""you big dummy"", ""it's the big one Elizabeth"", ""you heathen"" or ""ain't nothing on earth uglier than a 90 year old white woman?""  I don't know where to begin but i do know that a prototypical 1970s sitcom achieved immortality because of a small group of extraordinarily talented group of individuals such as Redd Foxx, Demond Wilson and LaWanda Page.  Only these individuals took the same material over and over and through sheer talent and facial expressions made it seem as funny and fresh as the first time.  I like to look at the fourth season episode ""The Stand In"" that showcases the true talents with Fred singing and Lamont doing a mean tap dance.  These were really talented people and while some episodes fall flat (especially the 9 episodes without Redd Foxx who departed during an unsuccessful salary dispute - Grady, you ain't no Fred) this show has always been one of my favorites.  The picture is more decent than one would expect from a show of this vintage - a slight graininess and very few artifacts.  This is the show to buy - WARNING - IF YOU DON'T LIKE POLITICALLY INCORRECT HUMOR THIS SHOW AINT FOR YOU - if you do, you will laugh your @$$ off.

As to the packaging, quit yer whining.  I bought this for $20 as a lightning deal but would have gladly paid the regular $25.  Sure the case is cheap, but the discs don't move and they are safe especially when the discs and the spindle is secure in the box.  Or you can do I what i did - put 'me in sleeves up on the shelf to save room.

So lighten up and enjoy this blast from the past.",1504224000,,1571,4.32764505119454

3538400,5,B001DSNEME,"Well, for the price it was worth the purchase. A few shows had pixels running thru them. I wish the shows were recorded so that they had chapters. My DVD player always was able to advance to the next chapters on shows. These were either at the beginning or if you tried to advance to the next chapter it would go to the very end of the show. Also some lock up issues in the recordings when trying to start playing a show. I had to turn the player off, eject the disk then reload it. The show then took. I would say to give the disks a couple extra seconds to load to the show you want to view, then hit play. Hey, likely recorded overseas somewhere. But at the extremely inexpensive price for these shows, it was well worth the purchase. My young daughters like the shows that I watched when I was a kid. Classic series on disks worth buying at this price. Buy some cheap disk cases to hold each one and protect them. At this cheap price, no one can complain about the spindle packaging. But just get to us a decent recording. Haven't viewed all the disks yet, but otherwise most of the shows look clear and sound good. Also, the menu has no auto play. After each show it takes you back to the menu again. But at only a little over $1.00 a disk, man Fred is King of Junk. I had these all on VHS from years ago from TV. It was nice to see the episodes in their full run. I saw scenes I never saw before. A must have for Sanford fans !",1495411200,3,1433,4.049295774647887

3538484,5,B001DSNEME,"I bought these a few months back and have been very happy with the purchase. I have to say that the episodes bring back many fond memories from my childhood. Many days I would come home from school in the evening and watch the days episode with my late father. And who doesn't like the 'junking' lifestyle? It's all trendy these days with folks buying old junk items to put in their million dollar homes. If you watch any of todays junking shows (like American Pickers) and you enjoy laughing, you'll probably enjoy this series. Now, back to the show. It's basically a grumpy old man who has trouble showing his feelings. He's quick to fire off a sharp (and often witty) comment but, at the end of the day, you can tell that it's just an act and that he's a caring old man. Not sure who wrote the series but they did a great job as it's become timeless and I can see folks getting just as much enjoyment watching it 30-40-50 years from now. One of my very favorites and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1468108800,9,989,4.351351351351352

3538564,4,B001DSNEME,"I love this series and am very fond of it, however the packaging really puts a damper on the enthusiasm. When I first opened the DVD box set, the DVD's were skittering around the inside of the box, perhaps because they were held too loosely together by one peg. Meaning the whole series is a set of discs stacked atop one another instead of having one peg per disc. Why skimp on what could make the disc potentially unwatchable?! Next, there is no ""play all"" feature, just a single option menu where you MUST choose an episode EACH TIME to get it to play. I won't even mention the lack of any special features (whoops, I just did ha-ha). It still doesn't take away my love for the show, it just adds a bit of bother to it, hence my less than perfect star rating",1446508800,,761,4.255172413793104

3538630,5,B001DSNEME,"I purchased this collection from a store, but I feel that I have to give a review of one of the greatest black comedies ever. I grew up watching this show every Friday night on NBC.  Redd Foxx is simply four words:  HI-LA-RI-OUS!!!.  Foxx and Lawanda Page, WOW! I call them the Dynamic Duo.  Their actual real-life friendship made their onscreen animosity come to life, it was a stroke of magic.  There will never be another show like this.  Foxx's portrayal of cantankerous, but loveable Fred G. Sanford is one for the ages.  Demond Wilson, who starred as his long-suffering son Lamont, held his own with the powerhouse Foxx, and their onscreen father and son love came off so real. This set is the ultimate Sanford and Son, completely uncut, and commercial-free. This and other sitcoms like this from the 70's may be dated, but they are well written and funny as Hell. So get ready for a Laugh Fest!  DONT' BE A DUMMY, GET THIS PRICELESS COLLECTION!",1433203200,,951,4.619047619047619

it is a remake of an older English show  ""Steptoe and son"" it is a great show also

3538642,3,B001DSNEME,"For The Price (23 Bucks With Amazon Prime Free Shipping)This Was Great Buy For Me But ti does Have Its Pros And Cons
Pros
The Whole Series For One Low Price
Picture And Sound to Me is the best it can get for a show this old
17 DVDS full of Classic Sanford And Son That Will make you bust a side laughing
Cons
Packaging is OK With the cardboard Case that opens and Reveals What Episodes Are On Each DVD
The Disc Holding Idea Of A Cheap Plastic Tray/spindle Was The Worst Packaging i have ever seen this is something even Mill Creek Entertainment doesn't do. Even mill creek entertainment Cases have a sleeve that holds each DVD inside a plastic case although some are stackable case designed to hold 3 to 5 discs on  some mill creek Releases. which is ok for a season of a show but for a whole series mill creeks layout is so much better..That is my biggest Complaint a Budget DVD Company can get it Right But a Big Wig Company Like Sony Really Dropped the Ball On This
While not a Big Con For Most it is For Me they never Put the Episodes in Order of Showing they used production dates which is Stupid.
No Booklet To Tell You What the Episodes guide booklet like was released with the Other Sets

Ok I Rate it a 9 for the content
a 3 for Packaging
What i did Was Bought Some Paper Sleeves and Ditched the Tray which is the way to go",1431388800,,1332,4.099616858237548

On the other hand, I got a high priced series, took the fourth disk out, it broke because it was a little tight. So, either way you take a chance.  The price is what counts if you are like me. I get three series for the price of one. If there is a little flicker who really cares. If you like the show a person shouldn't care that much. If it was music, I want perfect, but eyes, blink, it's the same thing, you don't stop blinking.

3538701,4,B001DSNEME,"I know of no comedy series that attracted people of all types, young and old, black and white, etc.  Other great comedies, Cosby, Seinfeld, etc., had certain age groups and political subgroups in mind.  Sanford and Son was written for the timeless stage, almost like Vaudeville...
The shows always featured Fred G. Sanford(Redd Foxx), a lovable, if irascible, old proprietor of a junk yard who, with his long-suffering son[Lamont], had to scratch out a tough existence.  We get to meet a coterie of friends, relatives, and customers, each one playing 'straight man' for Redd Foxx and his constant banter.  The battles with Aunt Esther alone were worth the price of admission.
 If you miss the 'insult humor' of the years before political correctness, then this is for you.  If you'd rather be 'nice' and see a nice harmless comedy, then just skip this altogether...",1422921600,,865,4.972222222222222

3538731,5,B001DSNEME,"OMG!!! The funniest show ever!!! I used to watch Sanford and Son every night as a kid and always loved the show. Just the theme music alone got you running to the living room... and now having the complete series, watching every episode made after all these years, brings back such fun memories. Hysterical, deep belly laughing the entire time. Fred, Lamont, Ester, Grady and all the rest of the crew are the best! They will keep you in some serious stitches. My 7 year old son, who didn't grow up on the show absolutely loves it!  We've watched the episodes over and over again so much that he literally knows every line of every person on just about every episode. As a small toddler, he would watch the shows with me when they came on the TV Land station every now and again... and would get so excited when he heard the show theme music, running through the house yelling Mommy, the ""grandpa"" show is coming on...I guess Fred looked like a ""grandpa"" to him...LOL!  Never get tired of watching the episodes of this show... all 136 episodes do we watch over and over again, just about every day. So much fun to watch and a ""MUST HAVE"" for every Sanford and Son fan! I read a lot of complaints about the packaging, that it was cheap and not durable. It is slim packaging as the item description informs, but who cares about the packaging, it contains the entire DVD set fine enough for me. If a casing is that much of an issue, then by a CD/DVD Case. This is an excellent product for the price... full of years of enjoyment!",1418860800,,1525,4.385159010600707

She will bring your chuckle up a notch or two. Fred and Lamont bounce off of each other as ""father and son"" and bring on a world of laughs. This series will bring a smile to your face, a chuckle to your laugh, and a overall warm hearted feeling with the father and son duo. Love it!",1418428800,,423,3.988235294117647

I am very careful with my DVD as a rule anyway so the single spindle storage is not an issue for me.  What you get is a true classic comedy in as good of quality as it has ever been broadcast and get every outrageous episode including those of the infamous ""Aunt Esther""... ""You Fish-eyed Fool"".

3538763,1,B001DSNEME,"This is one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and watching episodes always lifts my spirits and calms my soul, but the cheapo packaging of this set makes this one to avoid. It is basically a single stack of discs with no sleeves stacked on a single spindle in a very cheap and flimsy extruded plastic tray. The whole is then slipped into a flimsy box. No liner notes or info about casts or original air dates. Just the shows to speak for themselves. Spend a little more for the season sets with better packaging.",1411430400,11,516,4.329896907216495

3538765,4,B001DSNEME,"If you're interested in buying this, you probably know how amazing this sitcom is. Easily in my top three. The reason this set doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that the episodes are slightly out of airdate order. There's even a mixup with one of the episodes of season 3 on the season 4 disc. There are errors on each season. Also, the discs are on a spindle, but I reckon that what the 'slim packaging' means.",1411084800,,409,4.256410256410256

Although the dvd's are not individually packaged in plastic cases, I am still happy with the purchase. I bought a black zip cd case that holds all of the dvd's and still room for more. I easily flip through the plastic and material enclosures and see which dvd I want to watch. Overall, if you like 'Sanford and Son' and want it on dvd I would recommend this.

3538854,5,B001DSNEME,"I remember watching this show when I was a kid growing up, thought it was funny then, and it still remains one of my favorite Sit-Coms.  For those of you who think of Redd Foxx as a comedian who told dirty jokes, realize this, he was never censured for what he said on the set during filming this show.  Everything is here so if you have any doubts or have never seen the show before, due to age or whatever, then you will want to get this box set.",1388448000,,448,4.022471910112359

It would be nice if played automatically.  Other than that, it was well worth the money to hear my son laugh!",1387929600,,276,4.055555555555555

3538861,5,B001DSNEME,"What a great deal on the complete series of a great classic.  The only drawbacks are the packaging Sony decided to use and the fact that they omitted the period after SANFORD.  This set does not use pockets or sleeves, but uses a spindle which is as ugly as Esther's face.  No DVDs were damaged in the shipment in my case, but if one had been damaged I would probably have had a heart attack.  I would recommend using some plastic CD cases or paper sleeves for storage; the only good a damaged DVD will provide is as a coaster for your soda and ripple while watching the roller derby instead of Sanford and Son.  There is no insert contained in the set (hence the low price).  The only track information you will find is on the inside of the box or online.

Overall, highly recommended for fans of the show with only those small reservations on the packaging.",1387584000,5,859,4.364779874213837
3538862,5,B001DSNEME,"This is a great classic comedy.  Buying the complete series is wise, because purchase of the individual seasons will end up costing more.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone who needs a good laugh or just unwind.",1387584000,,224,4.717948717948718

3538866,4,B001DSNEME,"Love this show! The only gripe I have with this DVD set is that it doesn't have a Play All option.  Can't even lay down and relax without getting back up to go thru the Show Episodes and play the next one manually.  Other than that, great show.",1386288000,2,244,4.0625
3538867,5,B001DSNEME,"Few shows come close to Sandford and Son, even 35 years after it has left the air. The raw humor of  the late, great Redd Foxx is second to none. I can have the worst day, feel down and even a few minutes of S&S has me rolling over. Some of these episodes I have seen multiple times over the years..the magic is still there. Additionally, the supporting characters such as Aunt Ester, Smitty, Grady, Bubba and so on will have you reeling from laughter. This show isn't for everyone and it's had it's share of detractors through the years. ZFor die hard fans such as myself, however, you know when that classic S&S themesong comes on you are in for a treat.",1385337600,,656,4.333333333333333

3538902,5,B001DSNEME,I like the compact packaging for such a large number of discs. It is a real space saver. It was a good price for so many viewing hours of classic TV I love it.,1379548800,,159,3.7058823529411766
3538903,5,B001DSNEME,This was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it.  The packaging initially had me concerned but after all of the DVDs were accounted for it made sense.  Besides I hate clutter and keeping up with the DVDs are much simplier.,1379289600,,223,4.285714285714286

We don't have a DVD in the house, so we use these in our RV, where space is at a premium. This entire set takes up the same amount of space as 3 regularly packaged DVDs . The picture quality is pretty good considering the shows are almost 40 years old. Now if only I could get Andy Griffith show packaged this way!!!",1379203200,,437,4.214285714285714

That's not good, when it's supposed to be the whole series.  :(  Everything else about it is great:  the packaging is slim-line, which we love, and it's still a funny show.  We love that it has not been edited for political correctness (i.e., the 'n' word has been spoken once so far), which is fine and dandy.  Thank you for asking.",1378512000,3,504,4.242105263157895

3538937,5,B001DSNEME,"I purchased this set for my father. He absolutely loves this show...it is quite hilarious. They do not come with cases however, I purcchased a pack of CD/DVD paper cases to put them in and labled them and put them back in the box before giving them to my dady.",1371772800,,260,4.22
3538938,5,B001DSNEME,I love the complete series of Sanford and son. I hope we can get more of the old tv series in the complete series,1371686400,,113,3.75

 THIS IS JUST GREAT ENTERTAINMENT !",1371600000,,125,4.208333333333333
3538950,5,B001DSNEME,This is so much better than having all 6 seasons and having it fill up a foot in my DVD shelf. Now I have all the episodes and a slim case. Perfect,1371081600,,147,3.625
3538951,5,B001DSNEME,I finally found this complete series!  I have been looking for this in tons of stores around town!  Now that I have it I am enjoying every minute of every episode!!!,1371081600,,165,4.290322580645161
3538952,5,B001DSNEME,Well package and excellent working condition. Completely satisfied. The package came earlier than I expected so that was great. Also no problems so far with DVDs. I'm at the end of season 3.,1370995200,,190,4.787878787878788
3538953,5,B001DSNEME,These were purchased for my dad's birthday.  He absolutely LOVES them.  I bought my set from Sears online for $23.95 and they deliver to your closest store for free or you can pay $3-4 for shipping to your home.,1370563200,,211,4.384615384615385
3538954,4,B001DSNEME,"You will love reliving the humor of this ground breaking show. The video quality is pretty good, it doesn't seem to be as perfectly restored as other shows, but remember these shows weren't shot in hd, so it's at least as good and probably way better than you would have seen it on tv in the 70s. The price is right for getting the complete series. But the packaging is cheap, all discs on a big spindle in a soft and bendable plastic shell. Fred would never sell such crap packaging in his junk shop. But overall, I'm happy with the purchase, good to have Fred and Lamont back in my life.",1370390400,,589,4.267857142857143
3538955,4,B001DSNEME,my husband really love this series he is absolutely a fan of Sanford and Son although I really don't like the way came packaged but for the price you can't beat it all the CDs are stacked on one of another you need to buy separate disk case just that you don't get damaged. cannot play it on the Blu ray because there's a delay in the speech,1370390400,,341,4.029411764705882
3538956,5,B001DSNEME,If ur a fan you'll love it. If not ur not a Fan U won't. I must say good memories.,1369872000,,82,3.15

3538959,3,B001DSNEME,"Love the Sanford & Son and gifted both my husband & brother for Bday.  The very first DVD was/is scratched and we're unable to fix them. Therefore, a few chapters stop playing and basically shuts down the player. Screen goes black. However, all the other disc seem to have NO damages and are playing fine. I would rate higher if that one is replaced. :(",1368662400,,353,4.430769230769231
3538970,5,B001DSNEME,"I've always love this comedy show but I  couldn't remember the title of the shows. I scanned the customer reviews here and couldn't find a listing of the titles either. Well, I purchased this set and decide to list the titles myself for someone else so that they could determine if they had certain shows already in their library. It would be a great appreciation if amazon or the publisher from any company selling dvd sets on amazon, would list the titles of the dvds. I notice that at some other dvd sights on Amazon, good kind hearted customers went out of their way to list the titles of DVD sets they've purchased. Well I have joined their ranks and decided to list this set of Sanford and Sons 17 DVD titles.

3538971,5,B001DSNEME,"I loved this series as a child and I still love it now. Fred reminds me of my dad so much; old ,miserable, says whatever is on his mind even if it offends others, and stubborn but has a big heart and loves, just doesn't like to show it but it is understood. Every time I watch this I smile with thoughts of my dad.",1367625600,,314,3.8461538461538463
3538972,5,B001DSNEME,This collection brought back memories.  You just can't beat the price.  Do yourself a favor if your're a Redd Foxx fan...BUY IT!,1365724800,,128,4.7727272727272725
3538973,5,B001DSNEME,Purchased as a gift and all i hear from the other room is laughing. Makes me happy. Good purchase for a gift.,1365206400,,109,4.0
3538974,4,B001DSNEME,"One of my favorites. DVD's arrived on time and were bundled together with no sleeves around them, but they have all played fine and for the price you can't beat it.",1365120000,,164,4.32258064516129
3538975,5,B001DSNEME,I grew up watching this series & when  I was able to find the complete series on DVD I just had to have it.  It arrived earlier than expected & wrapped in a plastic covering.  I have yet to open it as i am using it as a classic collection.  I hope whenever I open it it will work as promised.,1364774400,,292,3.737704918032787
3538976,3,B001DSNEME,It has all episodes... but you have to play them one at a time it doesn't run the whole disc It's very annoying.,1364601600,,112,3.9130434782608696
3538977,5,B001DSNEME,The price on this complete series of Sanford and Son was great.  My dad loves this series and he watches it daily.  The quality is great.,1363824000,,137,4.230769230769231
3538978,5,B001DSNEME,"I ordered these and they are great quality DVDs, only thing is i wish all the disc had their own little sleeve instead of being put all on top of eachother, i worry they could scratch from spinning in the package. Overall very impressed and got them within 3 days :) Watch them all the time haha",1363046400,,295,4.192982456140351
3538979,4,B001DSNEME,"I got it for my son and he LOVED it.  I wasn't too thrilled with the packaging, but so far the DVDs seem to be OK.",1362700800,,114,3.3846153846153846
3538990,5,B001DSNEME,This was a gift to my son for his birthday and he has enjoyed it tremendously!  He always loved the show and now he can watch them over and over again.,1361491200,,151,3.870967741935484
3538991,5,B001DSNEME,This is for those who like clean comedy not the trash that exists today so you have to go back a few generations so worth it!,1361318400,,125,3.8461538461538463
3538992,4,B001DSNEME,"Yes, it's definitely Slim Easy Packaging, because all disks are on a spindle type thing and just on top of each other. If you keep your things clean and safe, its not that much of a hassle. You can't beat the price! So, in that case 5 STARS *****",1361232000,,246,4.040816326530612
3538993,5,B001DSNEME,I bought this for my husband for Valentine's day. He used to watch t h e show with his dad growing up. He was very pleased and felt it was reasonably priced.,1361059200,,157,3.9375

3538995,4,B001DSNEME,"It's a pity but only season 1 and 2 have english subtitles...the others haven't, the cover doesn't say that...so it's a disaster for me.
Update 02-17-2013, i found out this DVD-set has Closed Captions in English, lucky i have software for it. I ripped it all and now i'm busy translating all for the dutch fans. So tyvm.",1360281600,,320,4.5344827586206895

3538998,5,B001DSNEME,"My grandfather, 92, loves Red Fox, so I bought these episodes for him to enjoy during the day rather than watching the news all the time!  Now, he's addicted and walking around the house saying stuff like Fred Sandford! Lol lol lol....love it!",1359590400,,243,4.651162790697675
3538999,5,B001DSNEME,"I am very pleased with my purchase. Would've like a piece of paper or protectant between the dvd's, but it's still a great deal for an entire series. I watch them everyday!",1359331200,,172,4.40625
3539010,4,B001DSNEME,A great retro story. Covers some topics not dared talked about today. I like that the product is all in one folder.,1358985600,,115,4.2727272727272725
3539011,4,B001DSNEME,The series itself and the price was good enough for me. In my opinion it was a great value. Having said that the packaging was a disappointment. I mean the dvd's themselves weren't individually wrapped. But still I would make this deal 7 days a week and twice on Sunday. Sanford & Son is in my top 5 of my all-time favorite tv shows and it takes me back to when I was a kid. I remember the snow days or sick days away from school. Sanford & Son came on each weekday morning on reruns. I truly enjoyed the laughs and pure entertainment the show brought. I'm thrilled to finally get this entire series and introduce it to my daughter! She is loving it already!,1358812800,,658,4.23015873015873
3539012,5,B001DSNEME,"My favorite series was no longer on television,so my husband suggested that I try amazon.com.

3539019,5,B001DSNEME,"No it wasn't a fancy boxed set, but I've got enough old CD cases lying around to hold this collection. I love the show and content mattered more to me than the box holding the content. Seems kind of silly to rate a wine by the shape of the bottle.",1357689600,,247,3.96
3539030,5,B001DSNEME,"Great product. Even though the DVDs are stacked right on top of each other, none of them were scratched. The DVDs (in the first season at least, probably all the seasons) didn't have a ""play all"" on them, but that's fine with me.",1357603200,,229,4.348837209302325
3539031,5,B001DSNEME,"My husband has always been a fan of Sanford and Son, but could rarely find the show on television. I purchased this set for him and he has thoroughly enjoyed it. The seller shipped the package in record time, and in above average packing material. I was very pleased with every aspect of this purchase - quality, price, packaging and shipping. No complaints at all.",1356998400,,365,4.630769230769231
3539032,4,B001DSNEME,"Wondering why the price difference between the WHOLE series and each individual season? No bells or whistles. The discs are stacked inside the box, but this is no ""Box Set"" - no individual season disc covers. This was great for my father in law, who just likes the episodes, but may be a little disappointing to a ""true collector"".",1356739200,,331,4.627118644067797
3539033,5,B001DSNEME,"show was a great series.
This is enough said, this survey means next to nothing. I see absolutely no meaning to all this stupid  writing. Little or nothing would be done if there were something wrong. Not much can be wrong with DVDs",1356566400,,232,4.395348837209302

""Sanford and son"" is a sitcom in which a junk dealer, and his son. Try to live together and run their business, but the father is always coming up with some crazy ideas, and getting them into some funny mischief. One of the best sitcoms I've ever seen, Redd Foxx truly shines as a old junk dealer. I think that if you put this show back on the networks against the today's shows. ""Sanford and Son"" would reign as king.",1356393600,2,488,4.258064516129032

I highly recommend this box set to ALL Sanford and Son fans.",1356393600,,347,4.4375

3539040,4,B001DSNEME,"SANFORD & SON-THE COMPLETE SERIES: Cantankerous ""salvage entrepreneur"" FRED SANFORD was the TV role that raunchy night club/party album comic REDD FOXX was born to play. The scheming, stubborn, but ultimately lovable old man had a fondness for creature-feature flicks, ripple wine, and fake heart attacks as he regularly locked horns with his hard working partner and son LAMONT (DEMOND WILSON), whom he referred to as ""Big Dummy"". Their modest Watts home, a crammed-to-the-gills collage decorated in ""early junk"" hosted a dizzying array of colorful characters including FRED's ever present cronies GRADY and BUBBA and bible-toting, purse swinging AUNT (""Watch it, Sucka!"") ESTHER, who regularly traded barbed-wire insults with her argument-baiting brother-n-law (FRED didn't play favorites; he insulted EVERYBODY). QUINCY JONES provided the funky opening theme music for this NORMAN LEAR-produced juggernaut second in popularity only to ALL IN THE FAMILY. Somebody once proclaimed, ""There's nothing but junk on TV""...this critic was obviously hooked on a little diamond in the rough called SANFORD & SON for six side-splitting seasons.

RATING: FOUR BIG ONES",1354838400,,1159,5.699421965317919

3539049,5,B001DSNEME,"The quotes from this 5-star series are endless. The title of this review is a lonely sample of the hilarious zingers that Fred (Redd Foxx) would make in reference to Aunt (""watch it sucker!"") Esther.

Laughs abound in these wonderfully crafted episodes that covered all issues from family values to cultural difference and made great fun of every subject.

Sanford and Son was way ahead of its time for a 1972 debut. Creator Norman Lear (The Jeffersons, Good Times and more) had a great formula with All In The Family, and he applied it perfectly to Sanford and Son.

If you're unfamiliar with this sitcom, bottom line is that Fred runs a junkyard with his son, Lamont, and Fred's wife passed away leaving the two men to also run the household. But who could possibly not have at least seen a rerun of this classic show with its memorable theme tune?

This collection is as ageless as it is priceless. Some of the season 3 and season 4 episodes are without Redd Foxx due to contract issues, and that was a shame and absolutely effected the genius of the show. Thank goodness it was only a total of 8 or 9 episodes.

Hit the add to cart button. This is the big one! I'm comin', Elizabeth!",1346112000,,1187,4.476851851851852

3539062,5,B001DSNEME,"Sanford and Son has to be one of the greatest U.S. comedy's of all time. My brothers and I still mimic the dialogue:

Fred to Julio in Mexican Restaurant: ""What does Sangria mean?"" ""It means blood!......It is only a name! ""Oh I thought it was something that they brought back from the bull fight?

Fred to Lamont going around the world on a tramp steamer:  ""Don't be too surprised when you get out on the high seas and the first-mate says, WOULD YA SWAB THE DECK HONEY!""

SIMPLY CLASSICS.

I think that the writing was purely genius. The entire cast was pure chemistry. Aunt Esther, (You ole fish eyed fool!) Grady, Lamont, Rollo etc...

Fred always felt the Big One was coming. loved the Black Cop and White Cop routine as well. I use to do that one all the time. Julio was cool as well. dug when Scatman Scruthers performed on there. a very talented cast indeed.

3539113,4,B001DSNEME,"First of all, let's just ALL GET OVER the fact that S&S: The Complete Series comes without the discs being individually cased--go to the store and buy the cases!!  Okay, now that that's settled, let's talk about Domestic Syndication operations.  After a show makes its 100th episode (in prime time), it becomes eligible to be ""picked up"" in syndicated (i.e. ""local"") markets if the original broadcast network (NBC, for example) decides to offer the program for syndication.  Once a show goes syndicated, it is EXTREMELY RARE to see the show in its original, unedited form (due largely to the fact that local stations WILL trim episodes in order to sell more commercial time).  That said, one must realize that ORIGINAL S&S episodes ran about 25 minutes UNCUT (including opening and closing credits); this left about FIVE minutes for ALL commercial breaks (national and local). When S&S was on NBC's daytime syndication (14 June 1976 to 21 July 1978), the episodes were pretty much left intact.  However, the current syndication version of S&S episodes feature an average program runtime of 22:25 (about 18:00 to 20:00 on TV LAND). The good thing about this box set is that the episodes ARE about 95% complete; ""Happy Birthday, Pop""(Season 1 Episode 2) does NOT feature a scene between Fred and a shapely hat check girl (although the actress, Indira Danks, is listed in the closing credits).  A rather pleasant surprise is featured in the episode ""Rated X""(Season 2 Episode 24); at the end of the episode as Esther reads from the Bible while Rollo, Lamont and Fred are behind bars, they groan and turn away; the syndication version fades to commercial, but the DVD version features additional dialogue! Finally, in ""The Masquerade Party"" (Season 4 Episode 18) there is a weirdly cool scene (NEVER shown in syndication) featuring the actor Dap ""Sugar"" Willie (as himself) as a neighborhood acquaintance of Lamont and other cast characters.  If your only exposure to ""Sanford and Son"" is from TV Land, you're gonna be amazed; if you remember this show from prime time, you won't be disappointed--you'll just wish it was 100% complete--there ARE only 135 episodes (136 in syndication)--""The Hawaiian Connection"" (Season 6) was originally shown in only TWO parts (a one hour episode on 24 September 1976 and a 30 minute episode on 1 October 1976).  Regardless, the S&S purists out there will smile EVERY time they witness a scene on the DVDs that you NEVER see in syndication!! What would've put this set over the top is if a booklet containing rare pictures of the cast and crew (along with some interviews) had been included. I'd love to see the original tapes restored, remastered and uncut, but for the price, this collection is very good.",1311120000,10,2738,4.9369565217391305

3539131,5,B001DSNEME,"I am so glad that I finally got the chance to buy this set. I had watched this program quite a bit when TV Land and Nick at Nite showed this program in recent years. The show became an instant favorite, and now I can finally throw away the VHS tapes that I had recorded the show onto. Any person who is a fan of this program should go ahead and buy this complete series. When I got mine, I was surprised at the slim packaging. The discs were piled up on one another, and when I put in the first disc of the 1st season, a couple of episodes froze during play. The result was that the disc had a scrape on it. Nothing could be done to fix it, so I went out and bought a replacement 1st season. I went out and bought some slim line DVD cases to put these discs in. The spindle was flimsy (it broke at the top), so I tossed it, but kept the picture box. There might be some episodes that are edited, but that doesn't mean that this set is not worth buying. My advice to anyone who buys this set and discovers frozen play due to scrapes on a disc: try to fix the disc. If it is not possible, find out which season the certain episode is from and order that season (the good discs will replace bad ones, and any extra discs can be used as a backup). Keeping the picture box is a good idea, because it is a very handy reference as to what episodes the seasons had. For those of you who don't like the slim packaging, get some slim DVD cases and transfer the discs to the cases (but don't throw away the box). A must have for any fan of Sanford & Son.

3539138,4,B001DSNEME,"I have always been a fan of Sanford and Son, ever since I was a small child able to sit up and watch television. I am now 17 years old and when I saw this Sanford and Son: The Complete Series set at Walmart for $29, I picked it right up.

Pros:

+ This is the Complete Series in one DVD set

+ For the Price of $29 buying this set is a steal and you will save money over buying each season individually.

+ The spindle packing saves money (But creates a problem with scratching and finding discs)

+ Unedited versions of the episodes that you will not see on Tv Land (I have found that at least one episode ""Lamont Goes Karate"" has had part of a scene missing)

+ Sanford and Son is another great Norman Lear show full of laughs

Cons:

+ The DVDs are NOT indvidually packed in their own jewel cases. Instead, all 17 discs are set on a spindle with a piece of cardboard holding the discs in place

+ If Sony is going to spindle pack, they at least need to make the discs easier to tell apart as some in the set look very much alike.

+ The Sound of the DVDs seem a little low once the episodes start so you will need to turn up the volume

+ Season 3 Disc 3 has a notice on the menu that says ""Episode 319 Never Produced, See Insert for Fun Fact"" but apparently the insert has been left out of the Complete Series packaging.

+ Until you reach the first disc of the Fourth season, you cannot play all episodes without selecting another one at the end.

+ Neither the picture or the sound seems to have been remastered (But still a pretty fair picture for the age of the show)

+ As pointed out before, one episode seems to have had part of a scene edited out that remains intact on Tv Lands syndicated version.

 All in all, this DVD set is going to be for those who want to own the entire series of Sanford and Son on DVD, but do not want to have to pay a lot of money. The DVDs sitting all together on a spindle like this can cause a problem with the discs becoming scratched if one is not careful, and a problem getting to the right disc as you get toward to the end of the series. And it might be a good idea to pick up some disc sleeves for the DVDs. Sony, we appreciate you trying to help us save money, but really this can cost us more money and more headache than we really want. Pack the discs is some sort of individual cases next time please and also be sure that all episodes are uncut as at least one in here is NOT UNCUT!",1289088000,41,2435,3.9896907216494846

3539148,5,B001DSNEME,"Although ""All in The Family"" is known for being the most popular sitcom of the 1970's due to it being the #1 rated series in the nation, we can't forget how popular ""Sanford and Son"" was during its heydey: from 1973 on the show was the #2 rated series behind ""All in The Family"" for three straight seasons. Norman Lear, like ""All in The Family"", adapted ""Sanford and Son"" from a British sitcom and Americanized it by making the leads African/American. Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson were wonderful as the father and son who run a junk yard in the Watts section of southern Los Angeles. Although not as well-written as ""All in The Family"", ""Sanford and Son"" was funny, hilarious, and didn't take itself too seriously which was a welcome change from most Norman Lear sitcoms of the seventies that bordered on serious issues. Lawanda Page, a friend of Redd Foxx's and standup comedian with a mouth and mind of a sewer, became Aunt Esther, Fred Sanford's sister-in-law who carried a Bible with her, who despised Fred with a passion. When you watch the series and Aunt Esther's scenes, you can't help but notice Lawanda Page stole every scene from her co-stars. Lawanda played one of the funniest, yet underrated characters in situation comedy.
 This splendid boxset contains all 135 ""Sanford and Son"" episodes, uncut, and restored from their original master prints. Generations will enjoy this gem from the '70's over and over.",1273449600,,1420,4.819672131147541

If you are a fan of the series (and Redd Foxx in particular) you can't go wrong here.  The video quality is adequate and I have seen no video or heard any audio glitches so far.  The only complaint I have is the really poor quality of the interior packaging.  They have dropped all of the discs in a single pile on a center spindle that is so weak you can crush it without trying.  This is really sad.  I assume they cut corners to keep the cost down and I might not have bought it at a higher price (like pushing $200.00) so I won't complain too loudly.  Slappy White, Lena Horne, Dianne Carroll, John Amos, etc. are all here and that's just through season two.

I have always liked this show, but watching it on TV in reruns with all the edits and deletions left some of the episodes lacking. Now I can enjoy each show in its entirety, minus the commercials, of course. I hate commercials. I must add, having the complete series in one box is a terrific improvement over some other TV series I've purchased. I happen to love the concept of having everything all together in one box. The discs are neatly stacked on a spindle in the packaging, and all the episodes are listed on the box, in order by season, for you to reference. Nothing simpler. I don't care about getting a synopsis of each episode because they're all funny, and the title usually says it all. If you want the synopsis that bad, find them on the Internet, print 'em out and stick 'em in the box. Personally, I'd rather save money--and my precious shelf space.

Fred is unaware of any of this and all he sees as he's coming home and looks in the window is LaMont strangling a white woman.  Talk about the big one!  Fred freaks out and hilarity ensues.

3539207,5,B001DSNEME,"Sanford and Son was about the misadventures of elderly junk dealer Fred Sanford, and his son, Lamont. It was one of the few 70s sitcoms, that had blacks as the main characters. Unlike other 70s comedies built around the lives of blacks, Sanford and Son never resorted to buffoonery, to get laughs.

The considerable comedic talents of Red Foxx as Fred Sanford, and Demond Wilson as Lamont, were what made this show so much fun to watch. Fred and Lamont were always aggravating each other, and it was hilarious to watch their father-son squabbles. And they (especially Fred) were always coming-up with hare-brained money-making schemes, to supplement their meager income as junk dealers. The viewer was always wondering how Fred and Lamont could get out of trouble, after one of their latest ill-conceived plots to make it big, fell-through.

On one of my favorite episodes, Fred decides to try and make quick money, by purchasing an old race horse. Lamont comes home, goes to the kitchen to make a sandwich, and all the while doesn't seem to notice that Fred's horse is standing right there in the kitchen. At least, the viewer thinks that Lamont doesn't notice-until he exits the kitchen, and dryly asks Fred; 'Pop, what's that horse doin' in the kitchen??' Though the chemistry between Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson was what made the show great, the supporting characters added much to this show. Especially Lawanda Paige, as Fred's wild, holy-roller sister-in-law, Esther. The knock-down, drag-out verbal battles between Fred and Esther, were always drop-dead funny.

Creator Norman Lear, had a well-deserved rep for crafting excellent, cutting-edge 70s sitcoms. Lear was, after all, the man who gave TV viewers the brilliant sitcom, All In The Family. Sanford And Son, wasn't as ground-breaking a show as All In The Family was. But it was still one of Lear's sitcom gems. I for one, hope that Sanford And Son lives forever in reruns, on cable TV.",1261958400,,1948,4.969325153374233

This is a great deal on a great show.

I've heard many complaints about the packaging but I love it. I hate digging through three layers of box set packaging to get to the disc I want and this set allows you to immediately place the discs in a DVD binder (which I inevitably do anyway). The complete episode list is also very useful, if you love an episode so much you want to see just the one, you should know the title, and if you want to know which ones you've seen and which ones you haven't, that's what wikipedia's episode list is for. And as for extras, there isn't much that can be done on a show as old as this. I have no real use for a 9 hour tribute to Red Foxx or commentaries by people who don't remember making the show.

Now I have to mention that I ended up paying about 22 bucks total for this whole thing, so I can't complain much. But here's the thing: if all the major companies that release DVDs were to hold a week-long convention with the sole purpose of devising the most useless packaging for a DVD set in history, they wouldn't be able to top this piece of crap. It's a spool, just like you'd get if you bought a package of 50 CD-Rs. But those CD-R spools are high-tech compared to this. The little piece of pseudo-plastic in the center is about as durable as an outdoor ice sculpture in August.

Again, I didn't pay much for this, and I'm glad. I would have been willing to pay a little more for real packaging. But don't take away anything from the show itself. Great stuff.",1234051200,6,880,4.238095238095238

3539248,4,B001DSNEME,"For less than half the price of all 6 seasons bought separately, it was a no-brainer.

As Sony's TV show releases have been fairly consistent (mediocre digital remastering, shoving 9+ episodes onto each disc, et al), I'll avoid that.

Most fans who were holding out for inevitable price drops will not be disappointed at all.

Now, why is the price 1/3rd that of buying all the discs separately?  They nixed a lot of original, higher quality packaging.  Open up the box and all 17 discs are in a flimsy plastic caddy, secured with a nice piece of cardboard.  Go out and buy some protective sleeves and nix the cheap plastic tray and you'll be set.  That $3.97 won't hurt.

These are the same discs that are found in the $25 boxes with the proper plastic cases.  No additional content has been made; just original cases and artwork thrown out.  There are probably more reasons as to why the net cost is 1/3rd that of the 6 individual seasons, but the more the merrier.

If you already own the original 6 sets, don't feel bad - for the reasons I mentioned.  But if you've been wanting, now's the chance to scoop up this set.  If anything, more thoughtful packaging and adding $10 to the price would have been nice, but I'm not going to complain -- this is a great deal for a great show.",1230422400,108,1284,4.435897435897436
