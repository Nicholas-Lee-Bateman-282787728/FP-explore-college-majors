4912733,5,B0060KGS6O,"I had not seen this program since it had gone from the air, but I enjoyed re-watching this one very much.  I am gong to order more of these episodes and I know that I will enjoy them all.  The program was very high class, not one with vulgarisims or sexual innuendos. Although they were very loving with their relationship it was not overblown, It is refreshing to once again watch a program that you can share with  your grandchildren.",1390608000,,436,4.425
