4593465,5,B00575GYUI,"These classic Westerns, with great casts are superbly restored, not the schlocky versions copied off of old VHS tapes. They look like brand new movies. The colour from the 1940's and early 1950's looks even better then today's colour. When this DVD is played on a Blu-Ray player these classic Westerns take on a Blu-Ray appearance. An excellent buy!",1319328000,38,349,4.932203389830509

This appears to be identical (at least in movie selection) to the previously released Classic Western Round-Up, Vol. 1. However, if you don't already have these westerns, you won't regret buying these. My 5-stars are for the movies themselves. I already own the CLassic Western Round-Up, so will not be ordering this duplicate and cannot comment on the current DVD's qualities.",1316304000,28,448,5.136986301369863

4593476,4,B00575GYUI,"I became a fan of director Jacques Tourneur upon seeing his work for famed B-movie horror producer Val Lewton.  ""I Walked With a Zombie"" (probably best movie ever made with terribly schlocky title) and then ""The Leopard Man"" were, certainly, smothered in shadow and noir ""atmoshere"".  He also directed another hard-to-believe-how-good-it-is horror, monster movie, for British producers, titled ""Curse of the Demon"", not so coincidentally, as it turns out, starring Dana Andrews!
And Dana Andrew is the star of CANYON PASSAGE the reason why I purchased this 4-movie set.  CANYON PASSAGE is worth the price of admission on its own!
Set in the pacific northwest the movie opens on a very rainy, muddy day on the streets of Portland, Oregon and the detail of this color, 1946 movie is gloriously underway.  Low ceilings, cluttered but well maintained, thick log cabin style mercantile stores; bars and busy, smokey dance rooms at multiple levels!  Crowded chandeliers.  By the time the film shifts to Jacksonville, Oregon I, honestly, don't think I have ever seen an old west town on display or represented like this.  In Jacksonville there is no dusty roads or tumbleweed; no little white church at the end of the street.  Jacksonville has redwoods all around, a creek nearby, mountains in sight and roads (in town) that lean as part of Jacksonville's slightly rising elevation.
It is one of the few times while watching ""a movie"" that I actually wished I could have visited that town at that time.  Or, at least, been on the sets or locations of Canyon Passage while it was being made!
As for the story it revolves around Dana Andrews (the local, well traveled, honorable business man) Brian Donlevy (his character having gambling issues), his wife to be Susan Hayward, her fondness for Dana Andrews (and vice versa), and supporting roles from Hoagy Carmichael (musician of course) and Andy Devine(?) which avoids, what could have been, cheesy comic relief nonsense.  It is not.  Throw in Ward Bond in a menacing, very large bad guy role and, again, CANYON PASSAGE is very, very good.
The surprise movie, for me, was the 1936 THE TEXAS RANGERS starring ""Double Indemnity"" and ""My Three Sons"" dad, tv star Fred Macmurray.  He's actually good as somewhat of a lowlife thief who tries to go straight and joins the ""Rangers"" to avoid arrest.  He slowly becomes a better person - as well as his side kick played by Jack Wahoo Oakie - but ex-gang member Lloyd Nolan cannot.  Nolan's entertaining as someone who is somewhat maniacal.  Some forced attempts at almost vaudeville style humor prevent TEXAS RANGERS from being an impressively gritty western, altogether.  Early on the movie has an authentic, documentary nature to it.  The humor seems forced as if to give the audience a breather:  These guys aren't THAT bad.
THE LAWLESS BREED is a mostly entertaining, Hollywood version of John Wesley Hardin.  This is based on his OWN novel, hence the very one-sided viewpoint.  But, then again, who knows?  For me it was interesting to see Rock Hudson (already respectable actor and quite young) as Hardin; and remember those old Time Life tv commercials:  ""John Wesley Hardin...a man so mean he once shot a man just for snorin'!""  And good to see Julia Adams pre ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"".  Her acting...?  I don't know.  I like her too much to pick on her..
The worst movie, for me, not surprisingly, was Audie Murphy's KANSAS RAIDERS.  He just was not involved in many good movies (check out The Quiet American for decent Murphy, and respectable movie).  Still, this is not bad and I gave him some credit for being a young and kinda' wild (kinda) Jesse James.  If I remember ok.  Watched it once, kind of.  I will try to watch again though.  It could be worth a second look.
Bottom line these 4 movies for under ten bucks is a flat-out steal.  Get away with it now!  Start stealin'!  And begin the journey at CANYON PASSAGE.",1455580800,2,3924,4.823353293413174

4593482,3,B00575GYUI,There is only one real winner in my option in this set. It is Kansas Raiders starring Audie Murphy. It is however worth buying the set just for this movie if it is about the same or a little more than buying Kansas Raiders alone. I already had Kansas Raiders so I would be interested in selling this. If interested you can reach me at southernpilot01@gmail.com I am pretty choosey about my westerns so this is just my opinion for what it is worth.,1442534400,,447,4.333333333333333

4593485,4,B00575GYUI,"Here are listed all 4 westerns with my rating system of 5 stars or less.
  THE TEXAS RANGERS 1936. 5 stars.
  This was for me the surprise of the 4 films. Its the only one in b/w but with young Fred Mc Murray an excellent story. You will really enjoy this one.
  CANYON PASSAGE 1946 IN COLOR. 5 stars (10 if it were possible)
  This is by far and away the best of the 4. With Dana Andrews, Susan Hayworth and an evil Ward Bond. It takes place in Oregon in 1856.
  It has great story, fine acting and beautiful scenery and good action. A really good different western.
  KANSAS RAIDERS 1950 IN COLOR  2 stars.
  This the worst of the 4 by far. With Audie Murphy and Brian Donlevy. If you can believe it baby faced Murphy plays young Jesse James as guerrilla for southern irregulars with a conscience. Completely unbelievable as is wooden Brian Donlevy as leader of guerrillas.
  Very good action, otherwise 1 star.
  LAWLESS BREAD 1952 IN COLOR  4 stars. With very young handsome Rock Hudson and a very young and pretty Julia Adams. It pretends to be sort of the life story of famous Texas Gunslinger John Wesley Hardin and it is Hollywood style. Complete nonsense but colorful and Rock and Julia make a beautiful couple. With some action.
  So, well worth buying. Three out of four at a good price ain't bad!",1433721600,4,1308,4.407563025210084

(I haven't watched the other two yet). The scenery & camera work in the two aforementioned movies is excellent! I had to laugh a little bit (being from Kansas, myself) at the beautiful pine-covered mountains of Kansas in ""Kansas Raiders""! Absolutely NOTHING like that anywhere in this state! Haha!

4593500,5,B00575GYUI,"Four classic westerns in one package. Texas Rangers is very good, Rock Hudson in the Lawless Breed is also very good, but I loved Canyon Passage! I have moved to Oregon and seeing places I have come to know, along with very well researched pioneer life as a backdrop to an excellent story make the whole package well worth this low price. Kansas Raiders was bad history, and not great acting. But you should buy this and make up your own mind.",1400457600,6,443,4.414634146341464
4593501,3,B00575GYUI,"The black and white ""Texas Ranger"" was made in 1939 with Fred MacMurray played a bandit with a pal turned good.
With not much of a story and actions with injections of some light-hearted moments typical of the time.  3 stars.
""Canyon Passage"" from 1946 was the best one among the 4 with detailed plot lines and gorgeous sceneries and photography and an unexpected ending(without a major gunfight).  4 stars.
""Kansas Raider"" with Audie Murphy was a rehash of Jesse James story but with a lot of actions.  3 stars.
Lastly ""The Lawless Breed"" by Raoul Walsh about John Wesley Hardin starring the young Rock Hudson.
It is a lean western with a good story and a very good Rock Hudson in one of his early role.  4 stars.
Average rating: 3 1/2 stars.",1397692800,3,743,4.522388059701493
