1690709,4,B000063K4L,"BORN ROMANTIC cuts a slice of life out of London life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types.  And it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive.  The homing center for these disparate people is a Salsa Club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not, they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue.  One woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance, another is a bisexual who fears relationships, another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male.  The men are equally edgy, from a Scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman, to a ATM robber, to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch. How they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey. The acting is excellent, the timing first rate, and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the Londoners, just turn on the English subtitles and you won't miss a thing.  A lovely film full of surprises.",1036368000,10,1082,4.444444444444445
1690710,4,B000063K4L,"You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good.  This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny.  The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked.  I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks).  That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people.  This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either).  Recommended.",1031961600,4,1094,5.05
1690711,5,B000063K4L,"i just rented this movie without hearing anything about it. i am a lover of foreign flicks to begin with especially anything the bbc films produce. this film combines humor, romance and the energetic salsa music together perfectly. i was intrigued by all of the various characters and felt that they all blended together in perfect harmony. i can't wait to find the soundtrack and keep it for my collection. a great surprise and heartwarming film about romance and love and its many ways.",1029628800,6,488,4.821428571428571
1690712,4,B000063K4L,"A delightful British comedy involving three couples attempting to get together, ""Born Romantic,"" written and directed by David Kane, is a lighthearted, feel-good film set to a heartbeat, as well as a ""Salsa"" beat.  It features a number of engaging performances, and offers a contemplation on life with moments that alternate between funny and poignant; enjoyable fare that leaves the ""baggage"" of the world behind for awhile to concentrate on the more personal, intimate aspects of what makes the world go `round, and a pleasant diversion it is.
A cab driver, Jimmy (Adrian Lester), and a Salsa club are the binding threads of the story, through which the lives of the individual characters intersect.  Mo (Jane Horrocks), jilted at the alter some eight years before by Fergus (David Morrissey), has moved on with her life, finding solace in men and the Latin rhythms of a local Salsa club.  What she doesn't know is that Fergus, regretting that long ago decision, is back in town looking for her.  Meanwhile, a somewhat passive petty thief named Eddie (Jimi Mistry), after a botched mugging ends up at the club, where he falls under the spell of a rather odd bird named Jocelyn (Catherine McCormack).  Then there's Frankie (Craig Ferguson), who happens by the club where he meets Eleanor (Olivia Williams); but Frankie fancies himself a latter-day Dean Martin (""Did you see `Ocean's Eleven?'"" he asks her at one point), and Eleanor is simply not having any of it.  And it all becomes a series of ups-and-downs, ins-and-outs and highs-and-lows, as these six attempt to connect with (or avoid) one another.  Along the way there is music and dancing, and without a doubt, love is in the air.
There are some subtle insights into human nature to be gleaned from this one, but mostly it's for fun and entertainment, a film that will put a smile on your face and occasionally cause you to take pause and perhaps reflect upon the state of things in your own life, as there are elements in the situations and characters depicted here that are no doubt going to hit close to home for many in the audience.  To tell his story, Kane sets a brisk pace and never lets it lag, and his transitions between the storylines are executed perfectly, which gives the film a rhythm and flow that takes the viewer along with it.  He has a terrific ensemble cast with which to work, and he makes the most of their talents, as evidenced by the succinct development of no less than seven characters, to the extent that you have a good grasp of who each of these individuals are and what makes them tick.  And with a steady hand, Kane exacts the kind of performances that really brings it all to life.
As Frankie, the guy who tries so hard to be cool a la Dean Martin, Craig Ferguson hits the mark perfectly.  If you were around in the days of the ""real"" Rat Pack, you no doubt knew this guy; he was the one with the affected smoothness, all the right moves (at least in his own mind) and the appropriate ""nomenclature.""  He could be fun for awhile, but any impression he made was mostly on himself.  Happily, Ferguson captures the essence of that guy, but only the good parts.  He manages to leave the boorish elements behind and opens up enough to let you see the ""real"" Frankie, who in reality is just a guy trying to get on with it and do the best he can.  Coming off a bad marriage, he simply wants to find something (someone) good to share his life with.  It's a good performance by Ferguson, who is probably best known as Mr. Wick on the ""Drew Carey"" television show.
Jane Horrocks (the phenomenal talent of ""Little Voice"") also gives a convincing performance, as does David Morrissey as Fergus.  Together they make their situation believable, rather than a depiction of some ersatz fairy tale.  The development of their relationship as they attempt to reconcile rings true, which makes the romantic angle all the more real and unaffected.
The most endearing couple of the bunch, however, is Jocelyn and Eddie, who prove that when it comes to romance, the odd and the eccentric will find each other, one way or another.  Catherine McCormack is a delight as Jocelyn, a role that is decidedly unglamorous, but a character in which there is a unique charm nevertheless; one which McCormack finds and displays in a sensitive, sympathetic way that shines through from behind an (unattractive) pair of glasses, a neck brace and an introverted, introspective bearing.  And it's touching to see Eddie, a misfit of the lowest order-- played perfectly by Mistry-- drawn to this quirky woman, in whom he is able to discern a beauty that is truly more than skin deep.
The most striking of all, however, is Eleanor, as played by Olivia Williams.  Adopting a rather hardened exterior as a way of avoiding any real intimacy or commitment, Eleanor is something of a mystery woman, and Williams has a charismatic screen presence that sells it perfectly.  Like Ferguson, she opens up just enough to let you see what lies beneath, and it adds a deeper perspective to her portrayal of Eleanor, and you come to understand why Frankie is drawn to her.
Finally, Adrian Lester is effective as Jimmy, the cab driver who bears the weight of a dramatic event in his own life, which is his secret alone.  Jimmy is a pivotal character in the play, and Lester's portrayal lends some of the more poignant moments to the film.
Rounding out the cast are Ian Hart (Second Cab Driver), John Thomas (First Cab), Kenneth Cranham (Barney) and Louise Delamere (Maria).  An upbeat story presented with music and a smile, ""Born Romantic"" offers a romantic interlude that cuts to the chase and leaves the baggage at the door; in all, it's a fun and satisfying experience.",1028505600,28,5709,4.697394789579159

1690738,4,B000063K4L,"A British romantic comedy centered around a London salsa club brings plenty of smiles and a satisfying ending.  The characters are interesting and the music is, as one would expect, lively.  The cab driver is especially charming, with a surprise personal story.

1690741,2,B000063K4L,"This wasn't my cup of tea but it may be yours, I seem to be in the minority.  For me, other than a handful of cute moments (the senile Dad of one of the characters), the writer strove to make everyone ultra-quirky and colorful, unsuccessfully, no-one seemed remotely real (EXCEPT the taxi-driver, whom I liked).  I'm a fan of Craig Ferguson, almost worth watching to see him, but the dialogue was just so poor he couldn't overcome it.  There were several elements I found distasteful **SPOILER ALERT**, e.g., the bed-hopping, Ferguson's shrewish ex-wife.  The scene wherein Ferguson sang fell curiously flat, not sure why.  Also, I'm a fan of films that treat death with dignity, and this wasn't one of them (though it tried, albeit with the opposite effect, trivializing it instead).

None of the romances made much sense, and no chemistry between anybody, not the slightest sense of why the characters would be remotely attracted to the targets of their affections.  I wasn't feeling it, ""isn't love glorious"" (no), wasn't inspired or uplifted, bored to tears, sigh.  The characters and situations were so contrived, I wasn't buying the kneejerk romantic message ""There's somebody out there for everyone"" for a minute.  The only character I liked or could identify with was the taxi-driver, one cheer for him at the end, but not buoyed enough to make up for sitting through all the rest, waiting for it to get better.

1690753,5,B000063K4L,"Absolutely adorable, totally un-schmaltzy British comedy about a bunch of hapless misfits looking for love at a London Salsa club.

If you love a romance without the saccharine, and laughing, lots, like, until you wee a bit, you're probably Born Romantic, too.",1357862400,,440,5.183098591549296

1690780,2,B000063K4L,"The most significant aspect of this Legacy DVD is its offering of three short independent films completed n the 1990s by young American directors, a worthy presentation that hopefully will be repeated.  The first is THE ""C"" WORD (29 min.), scripted by its director Michael Selditch, a comedy depicting a young man and woman who fall in love after he purchases her car (the ""C"" word), an acclaimed effort that nonetheless falls short in most cinematic categories; another is CHICKEN OF THE SEA (55 min.), NYU graduate thesis film for director Christopher Livingston, a work that enjoys a larger amount of funding and the highest production values of the trio but is jettisoned by a hackneyed script that deals with an interracial love affair in New York City.  Felicitous moments seldom appear in these two productions; however, the third item on the disc offers viewers more pronounced aesthetic value while certainly being the most audacious of this small anthology: THE SEDUCER (28 min.), director Sean Reilly's film plotted as a truncated paraphrast of Kierkegaard's powerful novel ""Diary of a Seducer"" (a section from the philosopher's work 'Either/Or').  Here there is overmuch tracking by a restless camera eye, and erratic sound quality, but Reilly's storyline is compelling and he utilizes his prepared players well for a film that borrows from the original only what is required to propel the narrative.",1144454400,,1412,5.157205240174672

1690782,4,B000063K4L,"I love this film (obviously being able to understand the dialogue helps a lot), to me it's the quintessential Brit flick - absolutely what we do best - but I don't consider it a Rom Com at all.  It's very bitter sweet, and if all you're seeing is the funny stuff on the surface then you're missing the point of this film.  Every character had a dark thread running through them, a secret pain or guilt or just sorrow at wrong turnings made.  But it's also about hope, and the message that I get from this film is that no matter what disasters lie in your past, you can always overcome them or redeem yourself.

Adrian Lester was, as always, wonderful at the emotional epi-centre of the film.  BTW if you ever get the chance to see him do Shakespeare on stage then move heaven and earth to go, he is a sensational actor who absolutely understands how to act 'the beats inbetween'.

So, my advice is to look past the tabasco jokes and see the real film.",1095811200,32,951,4.314606741573034
1690783,4,B000063K4L,"Hubby and I have finally solved our problem of being unable to understand English accents that are other than what one hears on the BBC and are referred to as ""posh"" or upperclass.  We now turn on the English subtitles and watch them that way.  It used to be that fifteen minutes into a movie like this we'd be turning it off because we had such trouble understanding them.  With the advent of English subtitles being on all DVDs, those days are over.  The film is a relationship film set in London and involves rougly 7 different men and women and their attempts to get together through the use of their local Salsa dance club.

Every character in here has relationship problems but they tend to be funny ones.  There is minimal contact with the world of divorce and even less with the world of single parenting.  Instead, these are all singles trying to connect and flopping fabulously at it most of the time.  Each character has his or her own eccentricity which is well handled too.  I can't say I need to own this film but for an evening's viewing, it was a lot of fun.  There are two men who play cab drivers in a restaurant who have some absolutely hilarious dialogues with one another.  They aren't part of the other action but as comedy sketches, their scenes together are gems.
