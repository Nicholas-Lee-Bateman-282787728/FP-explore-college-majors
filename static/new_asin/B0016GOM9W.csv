8262341,5,B0016GOM9W,"The less known about the plot the better for this movie.  In brief, Anand (Salman Khan) is admitted to a mental hospital in a childlike state where he is treated by three doctors, Tanvi (Kareena Kapoor), Sunil (Jackie Shroff), and Dr. Khurana (Om Puri).  His past is shown in flashback, and Rimi Sen plays Maya, Anand's love interest.

This fantastic drama is funny, touching, and sometimes shocking.  Khan plays the childlike Anand excellently.  Shroff and Puri give wonderful, believable performances.  Kapoor is a bit stiff at times,  but generally convincing.  The music is good, with some lovely lyrics.  Kapoor's costumes are beautiful.  The plot is gripping, keeping the viewer interested throughout.  Overall, it is a movie I would universally recommend.",1519344000,,762,5.266666666666667

8262344,4,B0016GOM9W,"Salman Khan is no Jack Nicholson, but he sure dances better!

How can such a serious subject as mental illness be so entertaining?  If you are looking for a realistic treatment of the subject, don't bother with this one. Nothing at all about this movie is realistic.  But if you are willing to release realism and embrace make believe, give it a shot.  You just might have some fun with it!

The ending of the movie is pretty pathetic, especially if you know anything at all about lobotomies and the brain.  Also, Kareena would lose her license quicker than she lost her mind if she practiced medicine like this in the real world.  Letting go of reality is a necessity to fully enjoy the comedy of this movie.

But isn't that last statement true about most Bollywood flicks?  Relax and enjoy it.  I certainly did.",1307491200,,813,4.544827586206897
8262345,4,B0016GOM9W,"Really Nice. Rimi acts so well and Salman and Kareena are cute. I can recommend this film to anyone without doubt. Actually a good film I've seen. Songs are very nice especially Jhatka Mare, Kyon Ki Itna Pyaar and Dil Ke Badle. The man is mad and the doctor is very cruel. The story of the movie is admirable. Everything is mixed up like Romance, Family, Cruelty. A successful film. Acting is superb but goes down in some parts. Priyadarshan has done well. Again all said and done I can give 4 stars for this movie.",1302048000,,515,4.375
