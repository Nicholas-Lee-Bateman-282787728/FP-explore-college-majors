Its sad the company was driven out of business but the movie great - I recommend it if you can find a copy.  My daughter is now 9 and still loves it.

BTW - you can easily convert this if you still have a VHS player with a number of products sold on Amazon.  Here are a couple as of my review date:

8260018,5,6305625697,"Got the video for our grandchild. He loves it and watches it over and over as do his friends.  He can't wait to go to a teddy bear factory to make his very own bear. Adults find it entertaining also.  We can understand why.  The music, the story, the animation are all excellent. The awards it  received are certainly well deserved. We highly recommend it for all  children.",948326400,,374,4.4411764705882355
8260019,5,6305625697,"This video was perfect for my nephew.
I am not a parent, and do not have much patience for those nasty tele tubbies, or that purple monster.  Yet, I enjoyed this video, and the music is a fun, catchy jingle that I  didn't mind hearing over and over again, as my nephew turned it on again,  and again, and again....(you know how it is).
The humor is funny, and  it is very informative at the same time.  This video was a huge hit as a  stocking stuffer for Christmas.",948153600,,466,4.179775280898877
8260020,5,6305625697,"Okay, I'm a bit biased - I'm the co-producer of this video. Thankfully, I'm not the only one who likes it: Parenting Magazinelisted it as one of the best children's videos of 1999, and the National Educational Media Network gave it their prestigious Gold Apple Award. We also won a Regional Emmy Award last year.
Here's a description: Join Freddy Bear and his friends as they explore the factory and learn about the history of the teddy bear.  Witness the fascinating process of teddy bear production, from design to completion.  Along the way, you'll see the fluff-n-stuff machine, the bear bath, and you may even catch a glimpse of the rarely-seen inside-out bear!",947721600,3,666,4.884955752212389
