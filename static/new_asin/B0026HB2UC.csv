If I wanted a musical, i'd get Oklahoma, Music Man, or any one of many musicals available. Why the load noisy, &%($# music in this movie. It's awful and very, very distracting.",1375574400,2,311,5.0

8352582,5,B0026HB2UC,"I loved this DVD.  i am a sculptor and found it extremely inspiring.  Gaudens pushed the creative envelope for all realistic figurative and portrait sculptors.  I will watch this DVD many times, I am sure.",1360972800,3,205,4.8
8352583,3,B0026HB2UC,"If you said, ""Name some sculptors!"", I would go blank, most likely after saying Rodin and Michelangelo.  (Then again, I want everyone to learn about Edmonia Lewis and James Richmond Barthe.)  So it was nice to learn about another artist in this medium, especially an American one.
The documentary reveals that the artist showed promise as a child and crafted his skills in Europe.  But then the work is like ""BOOM!  He became America's most famous and in-demand sculptor.""  How did he gain fame so quickly?  Was there competition for him in this country?
Sometimes, folk act like adultery didn't exist until the late 1990s Lewinsky scandal.  However, a ton of famous men have womanized.  Like Diego Rivera, Saint-G. included his mistress in his artwork.  Like Bob Marley, this artist had a child out of wedlock.  They don't erase evidence to make viewers feel comfy.
The work pays a lot of attention to a piece about the 54th Infantry, that Denzel's ""Glory"" was based upon.  Colin Powell gives a token rave about the work.  I'm African-American, but at first I must admit that the coverage may have been a bit P.C.  However, the work goes on to say that Rodin took off his hat at the sight of the work.  It took Saint-G. 13 years to complete the work.  When few sculptors in the West focus upon Black subjects, this work does merit the attention it receives.
Many folk like anything related to the Civil War.  Folk can be as passionate about that as they are about the Beatles.  Saint-G. seems to have done a TON of Civil War-related work.  Enthusiasts of that tumultuous period may really like this artist's work.
The documentary is diverse in terms of the genders of interviewees.  The sculptor had a crew that completed his works.  I think the British painter Gainsborough might have worked the same way.  In brief, I would say a viewer could benefit from seeing this documentary.",1244678400,10,1883,4.714723926380368
