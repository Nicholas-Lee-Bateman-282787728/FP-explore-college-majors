7861054,5,630404870X,"""Thomas Hart Benton"" is a revealing and immensely watchable biography of an artist who probably reached more Americans than any other.  As Ken Burns ably proves, Benton's work captured the spirit and history of  the average American man and woman.
Combining samples of Benton's work,  interviews with art critics, family, friends and enemies as well as footage  of Benton himself, Burns presents a perfectly balanced approach to an  artist's life and his statement of America as a struggling, vibrant land.
You don't have to like Benton's art to like this film.  In fact, several  of the critics Burns interviewed for this one-hour documentary dismiss  Benton as a serious artist.  However, what they say about Benton is as  revealing as the praise of critics who revere him.  Perfectly balanced and  entertaining.",958867200,22,814,5.176923076923077
