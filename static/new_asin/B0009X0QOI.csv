8068898,5,B0009X0QOI,"Before beginning a huge boat painting project, I purchased this DVD to see if it would actually show the procedure from start to finish.  It was pretty good explaining what steps to go through after the initial fiberglass work was done such as filling scratches, nicks ect. It covered the methods used for doing the primer and topcoat as well as the equipment needed and stressed the safety issues as well.  We watched it quite a few times, taking notes and writing lists of what we'de need to get.  It really helped us out and our boat turned out absolutely beautiful.",1178928000,8,569,4.6138613861386135
