2196606,5,B0006VCFB0,"Watching Jencarlos Canela playing Jesus, I imagined Jesus must have been also a likable, approachable, but serious young man with a huge vision and genuinely good heart. And it is overwhelming that such a man had to pay the price for our sins and die so young... People never realized who he really was. He looked like just a common man.
This show makes us realize the Son of God could be anybody on the street, on TV, or even in your family, if he lived in our time! Judas, Peter, Pilate, even Mary can be you and me!
But I think it's very important to know God is working in our lives right now, just as dramatically as thousands of years ago. It's up to us if we make mistakes again and again, or become ""heroes.""",1475884800,3,716,4.233576642335766
2196607,5,B0006VCFB0,"Love this.  I watched the program on Fox, recorded it and have watched it many times since.  The DVD is so much better than the telecast for one reason:  the acted scenes are shown in their entirety in the DVD.  The televised program kept cutting into the scenes to show audience reaction.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  This was extremely disruptive to viewing.  I can now delete my much-watched recorded version.  I applaud the DVD editors!
This program portrays the last days of Jesus on earth, but shows this in modern times and with modern dress -- as if Jesus had lived on earth today.  Also, the songs are contemporary ones.  I was skeptical about this before I saw the show.  The contemporary aspect of the program had a huge impact  on me and served to really bring Jesus and his message of love and salvation to life.  And it is amazing how well the songs fit the particular scenes.  The singers/actors did a great job.  I had never heard of Jencarlos (portraying Jesus) before watching this program.  He was a real revelation.",1475625600,22,1041,4.570652173913044
2196608,5,B0006VCFB0,"EDIT AFTER RECEIVING DVD:

I was so so pleased to see that the DVD version had been edited to focus solely on Jesus' story. The interviews, which were enjoyable once but quickly skipped upon future viewings, were gone and the time was devoted to the prerecorded and live scenes of Jesus, though all of Mary's songs were naturally kept in. Some of the cuts of Tyler's monologue weren't terribly well done and could have been a bit more carefully spliced to avoid jerky cuts of audience sounds or previous words, but honestly, it's perfect as-is. Seeing Jesus' scenes fully without interruptions is a huge blessing and gave so many more glimpses into His beautiful portrayal. I especially loved the little shot of Jesus putting His hands on Peter's back and giving a little squeeze while they're walking during 'Home', which was missed before. Also, Judas grabbing Jesus during 'Demons' was so powerful. I'm extremely thankful for the decision to shorten the show and focus on Jesus! An amazing production made even better by wise editing decisions.

PREVIOUS REVIEW:

When I first heard about The Passion Live on a commercial a few days before its airing, I was less than excited about it. I was certainly curious to see how in the world a live production about Jesus that was set in modern times and used contemporary songs sung by real historical figures was going to look, but I was certainly wary. Could they do justice to the incredible story of Christ's 'last supper', death, and resurrection? Surely not, I thought. And when I watched parts of it live, my lack of excitement continued. I watched with a sense of sarcasm and was chuckling at the song choices, settings, and appearances of familiar 'characters'. There were times when I was genuinely impressed, but I continuously changed the channel before returning to it sometime later because I wanted to see how they handled certain parts. Overall, I didn't see enough of it to make a solid judgement, though I was definitely intrigued, so I decided to check it out again later. And going into it a second time, when I was fully prepared for the appearances of Jesus, the disciples, and other people, the songs, and settings, I suddenly began to see it completely differently. With that initial surprise and, dare I say, awkwardness out of the way because of all the things that were visually unfamiliar to the story, I quickly fell in love with it.

Now, I'm not talking about the interviews, or even Mary's songs, because those could have easily (EASILY) been taken out and the whole 2 hours given to Jesus' story, and it would have been incredible. The interviews, while interesting, took away from the story and did not add anything to the show. Though the cross arriving at the stage was a beautiful sight.

What I fell in love with was the story of Jesus told in several scenes, some pre-recorded, some live, that gave us a glimpse into who Jesus really was: kind, filled with joy and passion, excited, and overwhelmingly loving. I say overwhelming because specifically in the arrest scene, when Judas is, in a sense, trying to justify what he's doing in song (Demons by Imagine Dragons), Jesus looks at him with the most heartbreaking love I have ever seen in someone's eyes. There's no hatred or disappointment or anger. Only love. Only heartache and grief and sadness for His friend's choice and destiny. I had never before considered how the One who did not sin would look at someone who was betraying Him. Our ever so automatic reaction would be hatred, but His love never wavered. It was stunning. The arrest scene certainly stands out as one of the most incredible scenes ever filmed, in my opinion, but the live trial scene between Jesus and Pilate is second to none. It was the first time in my many experiences of watching this part of the familiar story where I genuinely wanted to see Jesus freed. I'd never thought about just how innocent and undeserving He was of being in that position, of being condemned in my place.

The Passion Live made so many things clear to me and opened my eyes to Jesus' unconditional love. I have watched it easily 10 times fully and countless times only reviewing Jesus' scenes. It has impacted my life so greatly and I know others who have been impacted just as deeply. And clearly, I can talk about it for hours! But I'll try to sum this all up very simply: If you have not watched it and are curious about it, I urge you to watch, while keeping what I said about my own first experience in mind. And, even if you have watched and enjoyed it already, I would highly recommend to watch it a second time to fully appreciate the lyrics and meanings behind them, the incredible acting, and truly beautiful production. I can only imagine how many months of hard work went into the whole production and I could not appreciate that hard work more.",1473292800,8,4851,4.681125439624854

Emily Woof, as one of Grainger's protegees also turns in a compelling performance. The film explores some of the dark sides of Grainger, including his proclivity for bondage, so is not for the kiddies. The exquisite soundtrack includes Grainger as well as Grieg, Mozart and others. For the musicologist or Grainger-ite, this is a ""must-see.""

Tyler Perry narrates the gospel story as it is portrayed by a cast of impressive, high profile musicians and actors. No morbid fixation on the grueling circumstances of Jesus' death, but a nonetheless brilliant portrayal of all of the religious and political characters in the story. The songs chosen for each vignet were from modern music and yet they fit perfectly into the spirit of Jesus' last moments on earth. Even the audience participation was exciting to witness. I was an experience of the holy for me. The musicians and backup singers were animated in their performance and helped carry the forceful meaning the film portrayed.",1491868800,,772,5.0390625

This DVD cuts out the interviews with people carrying the cross and does not interrupt the scenes with audience reaction like it did on tv. My whole family loved it from my 76 year old dad to my 10 year old son.,1523664000,,481,4.2967032967032965
