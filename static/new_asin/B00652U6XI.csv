4960142,5,B00652U6XI,This is simply a great series! Though not as good as Reagan (which really stands alone) the telling of Bill Clinton's story is sympathetic and compelling.,1333843200,,154,4.961538461538462
4960143,1,B00652U6XI,"If the 60s had JFK, in the 1990s we had BILL CLINTON. I just got this today and even though PBS tries to do this impartial documentary, to me it was BIASED.

They didn't focused at all on his accomplishments as a president. Yet the focus mostly on the WHITE WATER and the LEWINSKY scandal.

THE BOTTOM LINE - He left this country in a SURPLUS which is something we CANT say about any of the BUSH'S administrations. Specially George Bush Jr, who left this country after 8 years in Shrapnel. Thanks to BUSH we are in the shape we are in 2012 with very high unemployment and I hate to admit it but Obama hasn't done much.

I don't know why TED SORENSEN(JFK's personal aide) before he passed way was always comparing OBAMA to JFK(I think he got paid off), where in fact Clinton was more like JFK. The only thing is that we didn't have to deal with a nuclear crisis like JFK in October of 1962.

JFK & CLINTON - Both suffered defeats, The Bay Of Pigs and Rwanda....and specially were womanizers. SO WHAT WHO CARES????? JFK I guess because of fortune of the 1960s, wasn't bothered with his private life which is the way it should be in a presidents life. Like Clinton will say once, even though he lied, ""It is time to stop prying into personal lives and get on with our national life"".

If Clinton banged Lewinsky like a Salvation Army drum. So what!! How many Republicans Senators, Congressmen and other politicians don't do the same and all the right wingers try to act as they were saints. HELL NO!

But all good presidents that stand by the people of this country and are against giving the RICH tax breaks always have to pay a high price.

This DVD is informative and GOD knows I wanted a copy, but I think a lot of it is emphasized in scandals and his personal life. Who cares!

JFK who was an amazing president did Marylin Monroe, his girl staff and anyone that came into the picture. Is not what he does in his personal life, is that he does for our NATIONAL LIFE like CLINTON DID and is what that counts.

I have to give this DVD a 1 star rating because it defeats the purpose of what it should've been. Yet the history channel did this documentary on Reagan like he was a hero. If this documentary was this hard and abrasive, I don't want to imagine what they did for George Bush who destroyed this country in 8 years. But for all we know PBS may be republican like FOX NEWS and made him look like a saint.

I hope someone comes forward one day and does a Clinton documentary the way it is meant to be a President stood by us and left us in great shape. As I write this in March, 30th of 2012, I don't know if Ill see a day in my lifetime like the Clinton years because thanks to George Bush we are so badly in debt, I do hope we don't hit a recession like we did in the 1920s where people are outside in breadlines asking for food. If you don't believe me youtube it. It is scary that a country this powerful went through it. But FDR got us out of it.

BILL C - If you read this, please don't be mad about PBS because believe me I am. I do love your books and Hillary's. To me Clinton will be remembered as the only president who did make a difference for us and was in fact set up with the Lewinsky scandal to damage his character. But in the end, who can resist women. They are the most beautiful beings on earth.

THANK YOU BILL CLINTON FOR ALL YOU DID FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DID OR WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH YOUR LEGACY!!

GOD BLESS YOU

RAY ST JOHN

P.S. Besides the fact that I hate this, I do recommend BILL CLINTON - BIOGRAPHY on DVD. That one is very good but it falls short. Is only about 50 mins. That one does cover all the GOOD he did an goes barely through all the issues. This one is the other way around!",1333065600,11,3765,4.145404663923182
4960144,5,B00652U6XI,"Whether you're a Clinton fan or detractor (unless you're at the extreme end of either pole), I think you'll find PBS's two disc documentary on the life of the 42nd President of the United States to be a fair and unbiased presentation of Clinton's presidency, the good, the bad and the x-rated.

The documentary traces Clinton's life from his Arkansas boyhood, living with his mother and his abusive stepfather, and follows with how he met and married Hillary, his early political rise leading to his time in the Governor's mansion, complete with the triumphs and disasters which accompanied his tenure in state politics. It describes how his national profile became elevated, how a long and boring speech at a Democratic convention almost torpedoed his political ascendency, and how he was able to learn from and get past that mistake. It goes on to relive his campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1992, complete with the first national publicity of his extra-marital affairs, and the masterful way in which he overcame that hurdle to become the Comeback Kid.

The segment on the 1992 election is a wonderful recounting of how the obscure southern governor was able to defeat a President who, less than a year earlier, enjoyed an unprecedented 90% approval rating by schooling everyone in the lesson that, when it comes to presidential elections, ""it's the economy stupid"", a lesson that subsequent presidents forget at their peril.

The documentary reminds us that even with a Democratic congress, it wasn't all sunshine and roses for the Clinton presidency, but when the tide turned and Newt Gingrich and the Republicans took over congress, a series of very dramatic showdowns brought government to a halt and how skillful political manipulation was able to bring about an end to the stalemate. It is amazing to watch how Clinton was able to make lemonade from lemons, leaving a legacy of being the last President to bring about surplus budgets. The program explains how Clinton was able to secure his reelection, but at a price of losing some support within his base by passing welfare reforms. The story of how the counsel of Dick Morris was able to help steer the Clinton Presidency away from political rocks is all the more interesting when recounted by Morris himself and other principal players of the time.

Of course the documentary also tells the story of the investigations against the Clintons: first Whitewater, which uncovered the sordid tale of a young intern named Monica Lewinsky and some bad behavior by a president. The filmmakers present the cases both pro and con of those who argue that the first impeachment of a President since Andrew Johnson was or wasn't about sex, as we're reminded of Clinton's grand jury testimony and his alleged perjury. They are careful to walk a fine line in presenting opposing viewpoints of what Kenneth Starr's motives were, while offering no conclusions of their own.

The selection of film footage is appropriate and outstanding. Complex issues are explained with remarkable clarity and the comments by some of the leading players and witnesses including Starr, Clinton's Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and politicians, cabinet members and journalists of the day add to the authenticity of this remarkable video chronicle. I found this to be an unbiased and very well presented documentary on the life of this intelligent, emotional, complicated and flawed president, and I recommend this documentary highly.",1330732800,28,3466,5.073684210526316
4960145,5,B00652U6XI,"Was very excited to see this available before it airs on PBS. I've loved the other presidential documentaries by American Experience and have been looking forward to this.
My favorite part was the old photos of Bill and Hillary. I enjoyed the profile of her as a strong educated female who fell in love with this charmer, and I felt bad for her when he time and time again was proven to be a womanizer. Clearly she had her eye on the prize of the White House, and was instrumental in making it happen.
Looking forward to Part 2!",1329523200,,528,4.343434343434343

Newsflash, their are so many better aspirations than a life of filthy politics and all of the messes that are created when you are haven't enough discipline to not make the trade offs.  Many will look at this story with nothing but admiration.  To me, it is so disappointing to see two people screw everyone, including themselves over in their mutual quest for power.  What a waste of two otherwise talented lives.  How would you like to be Chelsea, and not have any idea of what to expect from a parent because both have spent their entire lives chasing power.

It squeezes his pre-presidency life/the 1992 campaign into 1 episode; then focuses very heavily on the first term, devoting the middle two episodes to it; then spends the last episode on the impeachment process to almost the exclusion of anything else about the 2nd term.

4960222,5,B00652U6XI,"It was very informative. I feel the narrative was not selective on the details of the Clinton's lives. As such, while many documentaries seek to exonerate or incriminate the subjects involved, I didn't feel like I was being forced to choose whether I like the Clintons or not. I learned. I changed my opinions. I was moved. I was disgusted. I did like the ultimate narrative of seeing that even though people have made mistakes, as long as they keep trying, they can still make a positive difference.
However, that being said, and given the information within this documentary, I also came to understand the number of and magnitude of the scandals that Hillary and Bill Clinton have been involved with and feel I could not trust them in positions that would influence other people's lives en mass. Their lack of transparency and continual muddied scandals to this day leaves me feeling they need a constant oversight committee to make sure they aren't cheating the American public for personal gain.",1440720000,2,999,4.882352941176471

4960228,5,B00652U6XI,"Very enjoyable and eye opening documentary of Bill Clinton's Presidency. I admit to being a liberal Democrat who voted for him both times. And while I was vaguely aware of the disdain Washington had for President Carter (being a Southern peanut farmer), I wasn't aware that the  prejudice was still going on during Clinton's years as president. I do agree that Clinton loved the interaction with voters on the campaign trail. I saw him when he was campaigning for his first term. Even shook his hand. The man absolutely glowed as he went down the street greeting supporters. Bill Clinton was handed a country in the depths of a recession with 7% unemployment and a huge budget deficit. When he left office unemployment was down to 4% and there was a budget surplus. And this happened without touching Social Security, Medicare and some other social programs that the right is trying to cut to this day. That long, very expensive, investigation and prosecution of Mr. Clinton for his extra marital relationships was a disgrace. Ken Starr was like a dog with a bone. When he could find nothing in the Whitewater investigation he decided to investigate the President's sex life. (BTW, Ken Starr has defended a couple of pedophiles). Not only was President Clinton one of our most intelligent and well educated Presidents, he was one of the best presidents for the well being of the citizens of the US.

That being said, it's definitely a puff piece with spin designed to enhance his image, excuse his actions, and paint his detractors in an unfavorable but not totally unwarranted light.  One thing I it nails is the success of President Clinton's domestic economic policy and some of the other good things he accomplished.  It's very light on personal thoughts and feelings from the Clintons and uses mostly public video and news clips to carry the story.  I have to take a star away because of the way it glosses over all the bad things he did which, while expected expected from PBS, is less than faithful to the truth.",1430179200,,851,4.808219178082192

What hasn't been is the shameful blanket coverage by the press of Monica Lewinsky. She's coming out of the shadows to start the debate, especially because the Internet is finding new ways to hurt and shame people. I wish her the best.

I'm more politically libertarian and don't remember too much politically at that time. I did think that the SNL debate in 1992 between Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman was the real thing, so take that as you will.

This documentary is very well done. I honestly went in thinking it would be a worthless pro-Clinton piece (after watching some of the ghastly, hyper-biased Reagan documentary PBS made that only interviews liberal Democrats who never interacted with Reagan) but decided by the end that it was a very fair portrayal of him, his political strengths (because who can deny that Bill Clinton is one of the most talented politicians of the last half century?), and his personal weaknesses. He's a remarkably complex man, and somehow manages to expose all of that to the public eye, because he has very little personal self control combined with a lot of political grit. The fact that I finished this series feeling I knew more about him but hadn't been pushed by PBS into either sainting or condemning him was satisfying. I'd even recommend this documentary to my Clinton-hating family.",1407110400,,1219,4.832535885167464

At the same time , it is still not as bad as a Fox New Channel version would be if they had done one. If someone is looking for basic info about the 42nd president, they are going to come away with thoughts such as, ""Man, this guy had it all going for him why did he blow it so much!"" I strongly suspect that this program was produced in order to keep the hard-line conservatives in Congress from eliminating the Corporation For Public Broadcasting, almost saying to them, ""look we aren't ALWAYS liberal""",1373673600,,603,4.441441441441442
4960341,5,B00652U6XI,I love all your documentaries. I believe I have gone through just about half of what you offer us. They are all great and not too biased. Some have a few half truths but most are fairly accurate. Keep up the offers,1373328000,,214,4.119047619047619

4960344,5,B00652U6XI,I loved this series. It would be difficult to find a more human being than Bill Clinton and his humanity is on full display. His flaws are presented but not in a judgmental way. The good outweighs the bad every time.,1371686400,3,216,4.2926829268292686
4960345,4,B00652U6XI,This explained a lot of history that I didn't remember from the time. I would recommend anyone who knew Clinton as their president watch it and see the similarities between then and now.,1370908800,,186,4.666666666666667

Full of first hand commentary of those who were there. Dick Morris was particularly good.

Very well-handled portrayal of Speaker Gingrich's ""revolution,"" and the president's accomodation, even incorporation, of those efforts, to Clinton's ultimate success.

Was it needed to spend an entire hour on President Clinton's affair with Monica? Yes, it was important, but there were other things going on on this planet during that time ... Smacks of pedestrian sensationalism, not serious analysis.",1368576000,,657,5.55

4960349,3,B00652U6XI,"While this documentary does cover the political rise and presidency of Bill Clinton well overall there were some things that I felt should have been brought up. For example, if women problems were the reason Clinton dropped out of the presidential race in 1988 how was it suddenly not a problem in 92. Also there is far too much time spent on the Lewinsky scandal as if it was the only thing that happened during Clinton's second term. Many of the people interviewed, gossip journalists and the like have no place in a documentary like this.",1367280000,2,541,4.645833333333333

4960353,5,B00652U6XI,The series on former president Bill Clinton was veryr well done.  I did not realize all of his insecurities when he first entered office.

4960355,3,B00652U6XI,I felt that it went light on his mistakes.  Almost like the show tried to glass over his downfalls and highlight his good points.  I think he was portrayed as a better president than he really was.,1360454400,,197,4.297297297297297
4960356,5,B00652U6XI,"Having lived through the Clinton presidency, I watched the scandals and the witch hunts conducted by republicans real time.  Then and as portrayed in this video, many Americans were aware of the republican agenda, and this video tells the story very well.  Bill Clinton, in spite of the ongoing harrassment from his foes, still managed to leave office with a 240 BILLION dollar surplus in the US economy.  However, his accomplishments are still over shadowed by his personal failures.  This film is so important for those who have to rely on media and history books to tell the full story.  But MOST importantly, it is very telling of the way some of our elected officials behave after being elected to office.  Instead of working for the country (the reason they are elected), they spend countless hours and millions of dollars working to cause failure to one party over another instead of working to promote the growth and well being of our society.  I always enjoy PBS publications, and this one was as expected, very well done.",1353801600,2,1031,4.823863636363637

In its wider context, though, Bill Clinton's private peccadilloes occupy no more or less space than warranted given the pivotal role they played in diluting his presidency. Ultimately, writer-director-producer Barak Goodman has captured the essence of the man: A political natural whose uncontrolled appetites were, ultimately, as defining as his gifts.",1351555200,,596,5.862068965517241

You will walk away with an understanding of the course of his political life, and the major issues that shaped his two terms in office.

This man is perhaps least understood by people like me, who were very young when he took office and never experienced him ""live."" Before I watched this, I generally understood his tenure as one of a sex scandal and impeachment. Most of his other accomplishments and failures faded to the background. Thankfully, this video provides a vicarious catch-up on what happened a few years ago. Lest we turn Bill into a one-liner, it is important to watch this film, remembering what he accomplished as a politician and reflecting on his vision as a leader. Depth and fairness are really the goals of public broadcasting, and this program provides a great deal of both. The content is thoughtful and memorable.

That being said, the stylistic approach caused me to shake my head a few times in disappointment.

This film, though, at times strays into subjectivity, dramatization, and triviality. Some of the commentary takes on a tabloid style.

The problem is most noticeable with the coverage of the president's scandals. While you would hope the topic to be covered carefully and given due context, PBS seemed to adopt the popular approach - to make it an issue of book deals, high-powered wheeling and dealing, and attention-grabbing headlines. They had to have spent ten minutes of face time on the book publisher who wanted to expose the president for her own financial gain. Those kinds of people have no role in an objective documentary. It is something you would expect more from cable news, which will go to any length to make a story more than it is. You can also see the journalistic excesses in the bombastic language used by the narrator; he seems to seek drama out of every event.

This style reflects the 24-hour news cycle that began around the time Clinton took office and has degraded journalistic standards ever since. It seems the influence has spread even to PBS. If there is any degree of bias in the film, it comes from the mouths of these interviewees. Each talking head seems to have an agenda, be it defending the president or celebrating his decline.

Even with these objections in mind, I cannot but strongly endorse the program. It presents a remarkable biography that can add to the understanding of anyone who watches it. And it does so with a richness that makes the experience worthwhile. It is most of what you would expect from a quality documentary.",1334361600,10,2924,5.212765957446808

As an observant nonpartisan adult during both Clinton campaigns and presidencies, I was surprised by complete omission of AmeriCorps, student loan payment in exchange for government service, and many other accomplishments. It mentions his welfare reform only in a backhanded way. It gives the impression he was incompetent during his first term, which he was not. It exaggerates his minor flaws and omits his biggest mistakes--continued deregulation of the financial and banking systems despite opposition by the chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; getting involved in the centuries-old religious war in the Balkans. It does not address the irrational, malevolent, relentless defamation of President and First Lady Clinton by their detractors, which started while Bush 41 was still president and was a significant change in dirty politics at that time compared with decades prior (I typed ""decades"" not ""a century"").

Once the campaigns and the power dim those that surround these people tend to be more forthcoming. There is an honest assessment of their time in office. Corruption, lies, and inexperience are all on the table. Even when they admit to Clinton's flawed personality they are still attached to this over grow boy. A stereotypical politician promising everything to everyone yet so many fell for the good ol'boy in chief. Still much like JFK history we learn two things wrongs were committed, we know that now and they are admitted now, yet like Clinton he is strangely beloved. All of the presidents series on pbs have been good for a general overview of history. The more in depth thru reading you go the shallower they become. You can't expect a few hours to do a whole persons life justice. Good or bad, biased or not we see what we wish to see from our leaders and we get what we deserve.",1467763200,,999,4.649717514124294
