8346409,2,B001VH7A6S,"I thought that Remastered & Restored would make the copies better, but it seems that its just a hype to get you to purchase the DVD's. The picture quality is POOR at best; it reminds me of a copy of a VHS on SLP speed that was copied again. The sound was just adequate at best, not what I would expect from a digitally Remastered & Restored copy.  Don't waste you money.",1370563200,,370,4.138888888888889

Thanks a lot!",1240358400,3,226,4.512195121951219
