8549887,5,B000RH24AK,Too many docs fall short of the mark. Either the production values or the script or just the plain boring idea undermine them. But not so this one. We bought a copy as a gift for a relative who is a monster Joyce enthusiast. The fact that she has always had a crush on Brian Dennehy was a bonus. She invited us over to watch it. We especially loved that Irish fellow who addressed the crowd. Was he not a politician or a former actor? This doc would probably also work in a senior high school or college/uni english class.,1224979200,5,522,4.23
