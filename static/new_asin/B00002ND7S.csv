7916063,4,B00002ND7S,"In this volume, which covers Episodes/Sessions 7 & 8, we get to see a developing storyline begin to form within the episodic sessions.  Fans of heavy metal will not want to miss Session 7, as heavy metal music fills the  background sound of the episode.  The plot features an independent woman  who goes by the name of V.T., and everyone is trying to guess her name.  Truckers with C.B. radios will also grow very nostalgic with this episode,  as V.T.'s C.B. handle is ""Heavy Metal Queen"", and she uses that  handle to help Spike track down a very dangerous criminal.  But what is her  secret?  Stay tuned.  In Episode 8, we get to see Spike help a reputed gang  member with a bounty on his head-- but this member is not all bad.  Great  gag with helium in this one.  We also get to see a developing secret with a  music box that was first mentioned in Episode 5.  Overall, the video still  has breathtaking qualities to it, and is an excellent addition to the  series.",946252800,,969,4.403409090909091
