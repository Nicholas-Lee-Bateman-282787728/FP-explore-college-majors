2434573,4,B000BP86T6,"and Myron Cohen's Yiddish accent and sarcastic slaps take me back to a bygone error. No foul language.....just pure, wise tales like olden days. Nostalgic memories of a lost era.",1360972800,,178,4.966666666666667
2434574,5,B000BP86T6,My father in law loved this Myron Cohen comedy show.  He is a wonderful entertainer who mastered dry and silly humor - without having to resort to foul language and gimmicks.  So refreshing and a big hit with dad!,1360022400,,213,4.435897435897436
2434575,5,B000BP86T6,"He's absolutely wonderful.  Can you imagine......A comedian who stands
'still in one place and doesn't utter one profanity!  And still be very funny.
Amazing.

2434576,3,B000BP86T6,"... that neither this disk nor the 'Revisited' one contain the joke I wanted to see and hear Myron tell again, the one joke that inspired me to buy both DVD's, the joke often voted 'the greatest joke of all time,' the one whose punchline is 'He had a hat'. This joke has to be seen and heard in its extended version, and cannot be appreciated in print.

I agree with others that the video quality is not that great, and that this 2005 performance isn't quite up to his  performances of old. Still, the man is a treasure and a reminder of a time of more gentle humor.",1351555200,2,566,4.18348623853211
2434577,5,B000BP86T6,"Myron Cohen is one of the greatest story-tellers of all time.  He proves that a true funny man doesn't have to use filthy language or tell disgusting jokes, to be funny.  Unfortunately, there isn't much recorded material available.",1329609600,,231,5.052631578947368
2434578,3,B000BP86T6,"Needless to say I love Myron Cohen's work but this DVD is a low budget spinoff of an HBO show.  Way, way overpriced,something you'd find on a rack in 7-11 or Safeway.  Content OK one that misses the true Myron Cohen, this comes off as a quicky, ""cautious"" in and out gig.",1326412800,,271,4.1923076923076925
2434579,3,B000BP86T6,"I bought this as a present for my mother's 90th birthday and we were pretty disappointed.  too much time with Steve Allen and not enough with Myron who was not at the topnof his game,,at least as we remembered him.  He looked like a sleazy used car salesman!",1315440000,,258,4.354166666666667
2434580,3,B000BP86T6,The quality of the picture is poor. The introduction by Steve Allen is too long. Myron Cohen's performance was excellent and was to the level I expected.,1291420800,3,153,4.703703703703703
2434581,3,B000BP86T6,"I really got it for my step father. If you like Myron Cohen, & enjoyed him on stage & in the mountains. You will like the DVD.",1208649600,4,126,3.7037037037037037
2434582,5,B000BP86T6,Grew up with Myron Cohen on the Ed Sullivan Show.  Very clean and funny stand up comedy.  Helps if you are familiar with Jewish culture.,1168214400,12,136,4.4
8090455,5,B000BP86T6,"These jokes hold up even today. He is a great joke teller and I love Jewish humor, so it is 5 stars.",1501372800,,100,3.590909090909091

8090460,5,B000BP86T6,"Although several of the jokes are repeated, word-for-word, in Cohen's other live performance disk, ""On Location With Myron Cohen,"" there's enough different material for the fan to reward watching. The pointless introduction by Steve Allen on the other disk is replaced with one by Cohen himself, in which he expresses his appreciation for the audience and the hope that his performance will be ""funny."" I can't think of any other comedian who showed such genuine affection and gratitude for the people he entertained.

For fans of dialect comedy, or anyone who can never remember any jokes when an opportunity arises to tell one, this disk is not to be missed.",1403222400,,660,5.0
8090461,5,B000BP86T6,"Having only heard Cohen previously on several recordings, seeing him perform live added the additional dimension of his unique appearance and gestures to his act. The inexplicable pauses were revealed to contain facial expressions, head cocking, and hand movements that told a story in themselves. Unlike modern comedians with their ""routines,"" Cohen was a raconteur - he simply told jokes, one after the other, connected only by their typical subject matter of unfaithful spouses, funny accents, misunderstandings, and the gamut of human stupidity. Over everything was Cohen's genuine affection for his audience, expressed sincerely and with obvious gratitude that people were actually paying him to do what he had done for many years for free. It's not often one hears a performer show such appreciation for the people listening to him, in contrast with the contempt and disrespect for the audience that is part of some performers' acts.

This disc opens with a rambling, over-long introduction by Steve Allen that may be skipped without undue loss.",1403222400,3,1051,5.331325301204819
8090462,5,B000BP86T6,Without a doubt hilarious. This gentleman can keep you in stitches for hours. One doesn't need trashy talk to keep the audience in gales of laughter and enjoyment. JWD,1379635200,,167,4.793103448275862
8090463,5,B000BP86T6,"Clean, clever and hilarious. A story teller like no other, beautiful person as well. No comedians at this time can compare with good clean humor and exceptional dialect. JWD",1379635200,,173,5.0
8090464,5,B000BP86T6,"OK, so dialect comedy is no longer Politically Correct...  The PC police have drained some great fun from our lives! Myron Cohen was hilarious, witty, and lovable. Yiddish humor and storytelling at its finest!",1365033600,,209,5.147058823529412
