4906791,5,B005Z4ZCA4,"What great footage of the first wave of Marines through Iraq. Extreme Marine verbage, but, if you're not a Marine you wouldn't understand. Great documentary! Definitely worth checking it out! I'll be hanging on to my copy!",1325635200,9,222,5.027027027027027
4906792,5,B005Z4ZCA4,"""Here's the truth about being a marine you won't find on the local news."" Filmed in 2003 on his way from Afghanastan to Iraq to begin the march toward Baghdad during ""Operation Iraqi Freedom"", Lt. Mike Scotti of the Marine Corps shows the reality of what they went through. This is definitely the most accurate and truthful account of what the soldiers went through. From saying why they fight, what they feel, and what life is like. This is a documentary that is an absolute must see and the type that people will either love or hate, depending on their thoughts on the war. I say that based on the reviews that I have read of this movie and that makes me laugh because this is a soldiers home movie...not political at all but peoples opinions are so extreme on this that it becomes something that it's not intended to be. It shows both the good and bad. Iraqis cheering and wanting us out. The reason that I think people are giving this bad reviews is because the soldiers that are fighting are defending what they are doing and saying why they are there. Never once bad mouthing the president, although Rumsfeld gets a dig. Regardless of how you feel about the war this is a movie that needs to be watched. Overall, an absolutely captivating documentary that every American should watch. Like Tom Brokaw said ""It's OK to be against the war, but never OK to be against the soldiers."" This movie is the perfect example of that. I give it an A+.

Would I watch again? - I would, and would show this to people.",1317859200,4,1509,4.447653429602888
4906793,4,B005Z4ZCA4,"I found this documentary title on a list of recommended films as I searched for other ""raw"" documentaries about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.

I found it quite captivating from the moment it started.  It is filmed by a Marine Lieutenant who is a likable and dynamic character.  He pays adequate homage to his comrades and the editing is balanced to show both the chaos and horror of conducting war, while not missing the utter boredom and misery of waiting in the Iraqi/Kuwaiti desert frequently referred to as a ""sh*thole"" - and when you see it, you understand why they felt that way.

War is a nasty business and I'm not sure the American public is tolerant of this anymore.  This documentary does not flinch from portraying most if not all the aspects of conducting an invasion of a country.  Independent of your political views, this documentary showed first-hand what our volunteer military force faces when the politicians say ""jump"".  I should warn that there is footage that is hard to watch even for someone who doesn't easily turn his head.  But I accepted what I saw knowing that people die in war - sometimes the wrong people.  To accept this and achieve the objective is the only way to win a conflict.  Else you shouldn't get involved at all.

I highly recommend this film for military documentary buffs.  If you have the insight to understand all the circumstances regardless of whether you agree(d) with the motives, you will walk away with an understanding of what it was like to go to Iraq in 2003 as a United States Marine.  These men have my admiration.  Thanks to Lt. Scotti for taking the time to document his experience for those of us fortunate enough to not have to follow these kinds of orders.",1292889600,37,1721,4.655629139072848

If, however, it was supposed to be a critique of the lies and bravado that cost so many innocent lives, then it failed miserably.  The only part of this film that questioned the lies and deceit that sent this country to a war that's still costing us, was a very brief voice-over at the very, very, very end.

I have serve in combat in both Afghanistan and Iraq as an Infantry Officer, and not once was my focus on documenting my personal affairs or events on camera.  It was on my men, and solely on my men.  While this documentary may be a 'perspective,' and truthfully told, it was a perspective of a young man with little perspective, but seemingly a tremendous amount of hubris.  It was as though it was more of a plan to write a book, rather than honor the ethos of what a Marine Infantry Officer is supposed to do...win, without trying to create a celebrity.  I served with me in this 'movie,' I applauded the footage, but I do not applaud the intent or motivation that seemingly detracted the young Lieutenant from his primary focus.

4906905,1,B005Z4ZCA4,"Although some of the first-hand video is interesting, I felt disturbed by the attitudes of some of the soldiers, including Mr Scotti.  Some openly stated that they looked forward to killing people.  The video shows them killing a man who was trying to escape on his hands and knees.  You see him shredded by bullets and then lying in a large pool of blood.  I wondered if he could have been captured alive?  Have we trained people to defend freedom, or to be killers?  We don't get much context for the incident.  They used the F-word so much it made me uncomfortable.  I didn't think these soldiers represented the standards of the average American.  I think that they think it makes them sound hard-core.  Overall, I was disappointed in some of the people I saw representing our country.",1439769600,,789,4.6521739130434785

This is how it is and this is what it feels like.

With the tension and friction leading up to the taking of Baghdad, Capt. Scotti gives us the best look at what he and his company endured during this mission.  I think this is a fine representation of the conflict, and the essential concept of what it means to be a marine.

Civilians viewing this film will likely not understand how Marines can be proud to have served in a mistaken mission, what grew to become a fiasco, but once ordering to war, you worry about those around you, your brothers and sisters and innocent civilians.

I almost quit watching. The soldiers became increasingly disillusioned and angry as the war progressed. This was more difficult to watch.

4907001,3,B005Z4ZCA4,"I have very mixed feelings about this documentary.

On the one hand, it contains some of the best war footage I've seen. By war footage, I don't mean combat. The actual *combat* footage is pretty sparse. But Scotti does a great job of portraying the Marines when they're not fighting, which provides some insight into that unique sense of brotherhood that binds Marines. He also shows what Marines had to endure in Iraq: the severe elements, the boredom, the inability to distinguish friend from foe, the changing orders, etc. My heart goes out to to everyone who was there and the suffering they experienced in the course of trying to fulfill their mission.

At the same time, the film perpetuates so many myths and syllogisms, it's hard to know where to begin.

For example, when Scotti claims ""We're here for revenge (for 9/11),"" even though the the Iraqi government had nothing to do with 9/11 - something we even knew at the time, though the Bush Administration tried again and again to conflate the Iraqi regime with the attacks on the World Trade Center.

Similarly, the Captain boasts that the Marines were there to ""liberate"" the Iraqis, as if the Iraqis actually wanted to be invaded. What incredible hubris.

Or when Scotti claims the enemy ""has no honor."" What exactly did he expect the Iraqis - who had suffered terrible privations as a result of the most severe sanctions regime in history - to do? Come out and fight in the open in full military regalia? Seriously? Of course they're going to fight a guerrilla war.

Or my favorite quote: ""The sooner we go in and kick Saddam's *ss, the sooner we go home."" That didn't exactly turn out as planned did it.

Did I mention there were no WMD in Iraq?

So yeah . . . mixed feelings about this movie. I know the guy was young, I know he was just repeating the propaganda / party line, etc. but it's painful to watch and hear.",1388966400,2,1884,4.56973293768546

4907005,5,B005Z4ZCA4,"I am an OIF and OEF veteran. And while I was there in 2004-2005 this movie/documentary is how I remember the war. I actually put off watching it for a long time but finally sat down to see it, years later and many more deployment afterwards. It brought back a lot of memories and feelings for me. Some good and some bad, and even now its playing through my head and opened up memories I didn't remember I had.

This is a glimpse, just a snippet, of what war is. Its funny, both comical and gallows humor, its brutal, foul, sad. You can feel the anger, the hopelessness and the pride those who fought there felt, if only many times removed from how it was in person. This is a glimpse of the current way of war, which is totally different than the past, while also being very much the same. If you served there I wouldn't say go into it lightly. Though I'm not saying it should be avoided either, just go in with full knowledge.

My father served in Vietnam. He used to watch Apocalypse Now one a year and I never knew why. Now I think I may, and this might be my once a year movie as well.",1384905600,5,1089,4.132075471698113

The movie will renew your respect and appreciation for these Marines and out other troopers. More than that, I hope people who watch this movie and movies like it will translate their emotions into doing something to help our troopers when they return from battle.  Talking to politicians to get them to push the VA and other agencies to do a better job, getting involved in private organizations that help our vets, reaching out to the vet down the street -- whatever it is, we need to do much, much better.

4907012,4,B005Z4ZCA4,"This documentary puts you in the shoes of a group of U.S. Marines who went into Iraq in February 2003 with the initial assault to topple Saddam Hussein and his regime.  They are fully committed to their cause and put themselves in harm's way for each other and for the Corps.  After seeing this film, it is clear how we need to engage in wars only as a last resort and never take these young warriors for granted. Let's be 100% sure about the need to go next time; shall we? There is significant profanity but in the context you feel they are entitled to say what they want and a lot more.  These boys have earned it.

Whatever the motivation may be for getting our soldiers involved in any war, the impact it has on them is not fully comprehended by those who have not been there.  Captain Mike Scotti has provided a realistic picture of the horrors of war and its aftereffect on those who have been there and returned alive and broken. I would also recommend reading his book, The Blue Cascade, which details his experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Both the book and the movie brought tears to my eyes, as I remembered the little boy Mike was, when I taught him in fourth grade many years ago. Pat Gatti",1346025600,43,757,4.438848920863309

What starts off as Marines being deployed and sent overseas and them goofing off,joking and playing around in the first 30 mins.of the film quickly turns into a surreal nightmare as the dark,grim reality of war finally takes hold. Warning,some of the footage is extemely graphic,as it shows the horrific aftermath of bombings and the bloody results of firefights,it is not a pretty sight and definetly not for the squimish!!They show what the news on tv won't show you,the sheer brutality of war and.some of the victims that are caught in the middle of it. This show reminds me of HBO's ""Generation Kill""miniseries,which was about the same thing-I recommend watching both! Overall a good docu on the war in Iraq,and everyone should see this to get an idea of what is really going on over there,but I don't recommend watching this one with children because of the strong language and disturbingly graphic scenes!!",1335830400,19,1008,4.970414201183432
