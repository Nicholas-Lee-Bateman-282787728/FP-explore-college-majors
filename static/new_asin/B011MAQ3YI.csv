8724609,5,B011MAQ3YI,"I love Fit2B!  I used to have an online membership, which was great, but we decided to cancel our internet for a while, so I was so glad to be able to get this!  I use these exercises to help heal my diastasis, and they work great!  I love Bethany (the instructor); she is so encouraging!
