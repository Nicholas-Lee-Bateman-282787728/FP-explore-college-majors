4465975,5,B004TP55YI,Who doesn't love a movie where they just run around beating the s*** out of people all the time. I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I'm also a huge fan of Hiroki Narimaya & Hiro Mizushima.,1383264000,,194,4.27027027027027
4465976,1,B004TP55YI,"Drop was a massive let down. It is unfortunate to say, but this picture was lacking in so many aspects. I decided to give this movie a shot, mainly because being a huge Crow Zero fan I assumed this film would be similar in context and genre. Drop was not portrayed well at all. The characters did not have a special quality to them, like the ones from Crow Zero. To me, this film just simply felt like a cheap imitation of Crow Zero. Nothing really sparked my interest. It was a plain, dull movie, with no substance. Eww...Drop",1350000000,,527,4.333333333333333
4465977,5,B004TP55YI,If you like a movie with a lot of fighting and some humor then this is for you. Great movie. The actors were great and very expressive. It was just really fun watching them play out the story. I would recommend buying it.,1340150400,,221,4.162790697674419
4465978,4,B004TP55YI,I thought the film was going to be just over the top silliness with crazy action but the film has heart and serious drama toward the end. There are laughs and crazy fights but Drop has more heart than I expected.,1329350400,,212,4.195121951219512
4465979,4,B004TP55YI,"With Funimation best known for licensing action anime, it was only a matter of time before it ventured into the realm of foreign films, especially one as action-packed as Drop.

I've always seen casual mentions of school gang rivalries in titles like Yu Yu Hakusho and School Rumble, but Drop has been the first title I've seen to really delve into the subject. You're introduced to lead character Hiroshi, who (as the back of the box art word it) ""drops out of his upscale private school and enrolls in a gritty public school."" Given a premise like this, you'd think that the poor, sheltered teen would end up getting in over his head when he goes looking for attention from his new school's gang. However, you don't get much of that outside of the rude welcoming the gang gives him in one of the film's first scenes, making for something of a half-hearted, but still unique vibe--something the overall film gives off as you watch it.

As the film continues, you're slowly introduced to Hiroshi's delinquent friends, each of them with their own quirks and at the end of the day are alright people for the most part... the only exception to this being the gang's leader, Tatsuya, who comes off as cool yet bloodthirsty given the proper situation, always defending his random acts of violence by saying that humans don't die that easily. While we're given a good enough group of characters to work off from, however, we never truly get into the minds of each member outside of Hiroshi. We're never given a proper reason for why any of them decided to join a gang with the only explanation coming from Hiroshi's sister's boyfriend--apparently an ex-hoodlum himself who claims that school brawls acted as something of an extracurricular activity.

It would have been nice to see this point fleshed out better, but to have it replaced with scenes of actual school gang fights works fine, too. While watching the many well-choreographed (not on the level of 80's action movie cheesy, but not like any recent overly polished fantasy fights, either) fight scenes throughout the film, you become so absorbed in the action, that you forget the reason behind it all in the first place. But because it's so entertaining you don't really care for an explanation even though one is clearly given. In a way, I guess this serves as the insight into each gang-member's minds--they don't do it for any reason outside of fighting for the sake of fighting.

With such a meat-headed mentality behind everything, though, you'd think the movie would fall flat when it came to reaching a certain status outside of a popcorn flick. And in some respects, you'd be right. Outside of the gang, Hiroshi spends time with his sister Yuka, his sister's boyfriend Hideo, and Hideo's co-worker Ono. Naturally, his sister doesn't approve of him being in a gang, while Hideo and Ono shrug it off as a ""boys being boys"" type of thing. And for the most part, you tend to side with the men in the argument. The movie actually leans towards the comedic and even stylistically switches to manga-style drawings when transitioning between scenes. Most of the scuffles Hiroshi gets into early in the film are presented so comically that you don't really see the harm in the things they do half the time. So when things take a turn for the serious in the last part of the film, it's somewhat jarring and making for a rather sloppy job of saying how bad gang fighting is after building it up in such a positive light for a majority of the film. Still, it was a valiant effort in adding some drama to what would otherwise just be a comedic fighting comedy.

There were also some stylistic decisions that while probably not that big to the Japanese viewer stand out like a sore thumb for an American viewer. Besides the general Japanese lifestyle depicted in the film (schools, hot springs, ramen shops), the overall story-telling of the film comes off as clearly foreign. Without spoiling anything, a certain scene near the end of the film switches between locations with everything done not only in slow-motion, but with overly epic singing as its background music--something you don't really see in American films (though I could just be noticing it since it's in a foreign language). Throughout the movie, lead Hiroshi also tends to wear a shirt that proudly displays the words ""DROP OUT,"" which while not all that noticeable to the typical Japanese viewer can come off as a message being spread a tad too thick for English-readers.

Funimation also had the courtesy of dubbing the film, having English as a second option if you don't want to have to read subtitles while listening to the original Japanese version. For the most part, Funimation's dubs as of late have been pretty good, only taking some liberties in some of the more extraneous dialogue. This film's dubbing, while not the least accurate I've seen, doesn't nearly stick as much to the original Japanese script as I'd expect from Funimation's latest works.

Since this is a live action film, I guess Funimation figured they shouldn't stick to their core anime fans and try to appeal to a broader audience, explaining some of the script changes in the English version. Mentions of ramen shops, nearby towns, currency, and yakuza are all brushed under the rug for more generic speak (things like ""let's go out to eat,"" ""going out of town,"" amounts expressed in dollars over yen, and ""the mob,"" respectively). Even the rival gang's name is removed completely from the dub, replacing the ""Devil Soldiers"" to a nameless bike gang... even though the name is clearly seen (in English, no less!) on the members' jackets and flags. Thankfully, the same hasn't been done to the more nerdy bits of dialogue, referencing things like Gundam, Dragon Ball, and even the Terminator. Though there was what I could only think of as a flub on the English voice actor's part, where Hiroshi mentions the manga ""Torch,"" while the subtitle in the Japanese version clearly states the manga being named ""Touch"" (the high school baseball manga, if Wikipedia serves right). There's also a noticeable re-write in a certain yakuza-gone-cab-driver's line, changing it supposedly so as not to come off as a potential molester, while maintaining his same lines later on when the female's face (and thus age) is never known. Choice in English voices for the most part works fine, too, with the exception of gang member Lupin being given a generic tough guy voice while I always thought he was rather flamboyant in the original version.

Where the dub goes from forgivable rewrite to flat-out cringe-worthy in its inaccuracy, though, is when the tone takes a shift for the more serious. While it makes sense to re-word some of the more comedic scenes to work better for English-speaking audiences, I feel like the more emotional scenes work well regardless of the language barrier and as such should have been kept as accurate to the original as possible.

As a whole, Drop is an excellent movie giving a more mainstream perspective of life as a teenage delinquent in a way that only Japan can.",1325894400,,7083,4.808702791461412
4465980,4,B004TP55YI,"Judge Patrick Rogers, DVD Verdict-- Drop plays like a violent fantasy of a teenager who was never weaned off comic books, caffeinated soda, and Van Damme movies. Yet that's the entire point. At times, the film is like a tongue-in-cheek indictment of a vapid youth movement going through arrested development. This is only heightened by the fact that these characters are mostly caricatures whose lives have no meaning past fighting, stealing and cussing. And yet the film also has a heart to it. While some may take it as a sensationalized look at youth culture, it also heralds a certain philosophy of ""boys will be boys"" and that we only have one childhood to spend so why not live it with vibrancy? There's a sense of bonding happening between these kids. Just because it's a bond borne from violence doesn't negate the fact that it's meaningful and cathartic to feel a connection to another human being through similar fascinations. Those who take this film or the violence too seriously have missed the point of the film entirely.

The fight scenes are incredibly well staged and photographed. The director adopts a fluid, long take style to capture the hard hitting and realistic (to a degree) nature of these brawls. The cutting in action scenes is some of the most seamless I have seen in a long time. Fists look like they're actually pummeling eye sockets and the bats seem as though they're really cracking some spines. Never does a punch feel like it's being pulled and never does an edit look as though it's trying to hide something. Instead the editing helps to heighten the sensation of violence and struggle.

The most striking parts of the film, though, are how self-reflexive it can be and how it juxtaposes reality against comic book fantasy. It makes a point to show the audience that it's based off of a popular manga series.

The DVD itself comes in a spiffy looking package. The guys in the art department over at Funimation should pat themselves on the back. The image of the film itself can be soft at times though. But on the whole it does a nice job at reproducing the film's rich and varied color palate. The sound mix, however, is something else. Combining the hard crunching noises of the street brawls with the comedic dialogue and commanding voices of the actors, this audiotrack never sacrifices one for the other. All the elements converge to create a perfectly balanced sound capsule of fury and laughter. The only special features present here are a collection of trailers for such films as Alien Vs. Ninja and Vampire Girl Vs. Frankenstein Girl.
