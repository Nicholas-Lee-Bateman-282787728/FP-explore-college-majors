8190473,2,B000PC1PAC,"This anthology of seven films features low-budget films that look mostly like amateur movies. I liked Callous Sentiment--I took it to be about the main character's loss of innocence and his self-discovery of his own twisted nature. Says host Tiffany Shepis: ""I'll never see playgrounds the same way""

""What Happened To The Zombie Killers"" is a fun little shocker--I'm guessing the director had some kind of subtext message about how society forces difficult women to behave, but it's high energy and very funny. Not very scary, though...

I bought this brand new for $1, so I can't say that I'd rent it for $4.99, much less purchase it for $10-$14.

The best part of the feature might be the special features. Tiffany Shepis and Denise Gossett are both very pretty ladies who are very enthusiastic about their experiences in horror films and also what it's like to be a part of the horror festival scene.",1520726400,,904,4.819354838709677
8190474,3,B000PC1PAC,"5 stars, really creepy, guy in  bird mask has a ledger ... a ledger of death
3 stars for bad acting and dumb ending. The idea of a succubus sounds great, until ...
4 stars, zombie disco. Lol until the zombie killers show up. Who will win?
3 stars, the playground says Keep Out because bad things happen in there, but sometimes you can't.
1 star, hooligan's valley is just plain dumb. We have zombies, WWF types, and a midget. Could have been fun.
4 stars, trick or treat. The little goblin wants his treat, and you'd better give it to him, nice twist ending
0 stars, scream for me is just plain violent, no humor, no nuance, pretty much just a snuff film",1421366400,,654,4.274193548387097
8190475,1,B000PC1PAC,The only things worse than the horrible story lines were the bad acting and directing. It had to be the worst two bucks I've ever wasted. Which I will never get back nor the time I wasted watching this trashy tasteless flick. Avoid by whatever means necessary.,1377561600,2,260,4.553191489361702
8190476,5,B000PC1PAC,"As with any compilation of works from different people there will always be some stories that are better than others, but this will vary from person to person depending on taste.  As for me, I thought that the opening scene was done well and has kinda that art house feel and implies more that it states, quite enjoyable. The other scenes were about what you would expect out of Indie Horror.  However the one that I liked the most and personnaly makes me feel like the disc is worth buying just to see is the final scene.  A crazed killer and a rapist run into each other while pursuing the same girl....now that's an interesting scenerio, leaves you feeling unsure who to root for if anyone, well done, delvelopes at a steady pace leaving you hanging on waiting for the inevitable moment to happen, nice and disturbing to think about.",1326067200,5,836,4.56
8190477,4,B000PC1PAC,Typically when I go into Hollywood Video or Blockbuster I get tricked with slick box cover art and a bad movie.  The is one of the rare instances that go opposite of that.  I saw a cheaply made box cover and took a chance on the DVD cause of Tiffany Shepis.  Almost all the short films were entertaining and enjoyable.  Visions of Horror is much better than the Fangoria short film collection minus the slick box art.,1191369600,5,417,4.376623376623376
