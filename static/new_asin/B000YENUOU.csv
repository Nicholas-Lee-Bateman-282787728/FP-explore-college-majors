3028293,1,B000YENUOU,"This workout is really boring. Maybe I'm spoiled by Christi's previous ""it-takes-a-month-to-learn-the-steps"" workouts. Christi ""takes it from the top"" so many times I finally gave up and started improvising. It you want an easy-to-learn step routine and challenging core workout - give this one a try. But if you want a challenging step routine, try something else.",1217462400,6,365,5.421052631578948
3028294,5,B000YENUOU,"Christi has been doing this for awhile and does it better than anyone else I know. I own ALL of her DVDs and enjoy working out with her so much. The ball workout is excellent. I use this DVD more than any other right now and the benefits are showing. If you want to see results, get it!",1205193600,5,286,3.9482758620689653
3028295,5,B000YENUOU,I wasn't expecting much from this but find myself using it over and over...the ball workout is very good and you don't need to use the ball either which makes for a fun change.  Really liked it.,1203120000,4,194,4.243243243243243

8232468,2,B000YENUOU,"After doing Christi Taylor's Fit to Dance workout which I love, I was really looking forward to experiencing another one of hers.  Unfortunately I find this one difficult to follow and not very enjoyable, I still do it to mix things up but it is definitely not one of my favorites.",1482278400,,281,4.509803921568627

8232470,4,B000YENUOU,"Having gotten burned on my last purchase, I'm being super careful with the next one. In that spirit, I'm letting you know this whole workout is on youtube. I wouldn't do it from there, because it definitely needs a bigger screen than I have, but it's a good way to tell whether it's your speed or not. I think she cues well, but it's fast and challenging. Not for the faint of heart. Also, I think the ball probably adds a lot to the workout, so get one if you don't have one already.",1437004800,,484,4.159574468085107
8232471,5,B000YENUOU,"This is a great workout DVD.  You can do the entire video or just parts of it.  Good music, easy to follow and fun!",1430524800,,115,3.75
8232472,1,B000YENUOU,the moves are way too fast with not enough  Que when moves are changing.,1427587200,,72,4.142857142857143
8232473,5,B000YENUOU,My daughter thinks this is a fun cardio workout.  She really enjoys it and it's easy to follow while still making you sweat.,1366588800,,124,4.391304347826087
8232474,5,B000YENUOU,"This is a wonderful addition to my ultimate favorite DVD of Christi's ""Power Body: Fit to Dance"".  If you don't have a weighted ball, you can use a single weight in most of the segments.  Although the ball would be a bit easier to use.  Some movements are confusing at first but very fun once you finally get the steps down.  You will get a workout even while trying to figure out the steps.  She's really good at cueing you on upcoming moves.  Once again, you will get confused the first few times of trying the workout but it's worth the effort once you get the steps down.  I highly recommend this video.  However, Fit to Dance is much easier to follow if you happen to have two left feet and fear ending up on your nose.",1281398400,3,724,4.233576642335766
8232475,5,B000YENUOU,"If you don't buy this workout you will be sorry.  IT RULES!  I will say it again, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH BUYING ANYTHING FROM CHRISTI TAYLOR.  She is a Goddess!  This is so fun and goes by so fast I don't even realize that I am working out. I LOVE IT! BUY IT!",1251849600,,261,3.7777777777777777
8232476,5,B000YENUOU,I've done this workout 4 times already and it's super fun! The music is awesome too! I really like the ab workout at the end too.,1229212800,,129,4.0
