2585290,4,B000FTCLTE,"The fun is about to begin!!!! Our Martha has brought us her always top-notch DVD of holiday fun and ""education"" this time in the theme of Halloween, which seems to be one of her favorite celebrations!!

These enjoyable and fun idea's are from her former TV show format which have been transferred onto DVD's. They come with her demand for nothing but high quality picture and sound, let alone the idea's and projects that will keep you and the kids entertained and busy for hours, depending on what great fun you want to tackle first!!

The DVD is in 6 different area's of Halloween magic:

PUMPKINS:

1) pumpkin carving 101 ( I really loved the use of ""miniature"" lights to place inside a pumpkin; it was so pretty!)

2) pumpkin creatures (this was a really clever way of mixing different gourds and pumpkins to make creative creatures)

3) pumpkin owls

COSTUMES:

1) supermarket costumes

2) fleece costumes (such adorable idea's like the little tree)

3) baby chicken (this was such a great idea for little ones plus idea's of the things you can make with garbage bags and coffee filters!)

4) fish head costumes (there is a material called ""specialty sparkle film"" that's used in emergency workers outfits and it is just brilliant for this idea and can be easily purchased at craft stores)

5) pirate costume

DECOR:

1) clothespin bats

2) spider cone lanterns

3) window silhouettes (these were alot of fun and the kids can pose for the ones you make for big windows or long glass doors)

4) glow stick spiders

5) specimen bottles

6) shrunken heads (this was a blast with the use of Granny Smith apples that are sculpted then ""shrunken""!)

TREATS: (these are fun to make if they aren't all eaten first)

1) Halloween cupcakes

2) white chocolate ghosts

3) popcorn balls

TRICK or TREAT:

1) pillowcase treat bags

2) animal treat bags

3) reflective bags (these were a great and kid-safe idea because of the use of reflective tape, plus the kids will have fun making them)

MAKEUP:

1) frightfully scary makeup

2) bruises and scars

3) special effects makeup (this is the filming of how Martha was transformed into the ""Spider Lady"" that was on the October issue of MSL; it's an amazing episode that gives some insight into the world of special effects)

The price for this DVD is well worth it and all the idea's within can be easily made without needing alot of time and money. So if Halloween is as much fun for you as it is for Martha, then consider this DVD and have a safe and fun day!!",1160092800,24,2503,4.592760180995475
2585291,5,B000FTCLTE,"I already have the 3 set Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years DVD's and love them, so I decided to go ahead and spring for the Halloween DVD.  I was not disappointed.  The ideas range from easy children's costumes, to devilish ideas for decorating.  If you like kid-friendly and fun spookable ideas, this DVD is for you!  Even if you don't have children, this DVD will provide you with a lot of wonderful ideas to decorate your home.  Thanks Martha!",1159920000,12,450,4.6455696202531644

8126427,5,B000FTCLTE,I miss the old shows...this video had some if those great ideas and well presented by Martha as always.,1496188800,,103,4.473684210526316

8126429,5,B000FTCLTE,"Martha stewart is amazing at anything she does, so of course this dvd is amazing and full of information and ideas.",1441152000,,115,4.523809523809524
8126430,4,B000FTCLTE,"Good, but still missing some of martha's best Halloween moments from her show.",1410393600,,78,5.076923076923077
8126431,4,B000FTCLTE,"This is an excellent DVD that gives you great ideas on pumpkin carving, kid's costumes, recipes, etc. You can tell Martha really loves Halloween. It gets me in the mood for Halloween every time I watch it.

I minused one star because there was one idea that was really neat, but the instructions weren't very detailed. It was carving the opening at the bottom of a pumpkin, drilling holes, then putting Christmas lights in the holes from the underneath opening. Problem is, the inside of the pumpkin got crowded quickly with all the wires. And the lights tended not to stay in very well or get tangled. T-Pins or something to hold the wires in place while you keep adding lights is needed. A beautiful idea, but the execution is not that easy and the instructions on the DVD are very minimal for this idea.",1400371200,,806,4.558620689655172
8126432,3,B000FTCLTE,I've bought a lot if Martha's DVDs but this one was a real disappointment in my opinion this did not have a lot of the treats I've seen on her show so it's a waste if time !!,1379635200,,174,3.6052631578947367
8126433,2,B000FTCLTE,"Small clips of Martha showing you how to carve pumpkins, make shrunken heads... a few food ideas.. I expected a lot more. Don't think i'll be watching this again in future.",1376956800,,172,4.580645161290323
8126434,5,B000FTCLTE,"Ok, ok...I admit it....I'm a mature male who loves Martha Stewart. Dont look at me like that....it's perfectly normal.

Martha is a cool woman. She loves to celebrate life.

Her favorite Holiday along with Christmas, is Halloween, and it shows on this DVD.

 Pop this DVD into your DVD player (and NOT into your VCR like a blonde I used to date attempted...wasnt pretty. Oh the Blonde WAS pretty...she was so hot I wanted to.....well...let me get back to the DD...er, I mean DVD) and OH YEAH!

 You can have a Halloween party any time of year.

  Martha covers just about everything Halloween on this DVD.

  Do ya wanna carve awesome Pumpkins? Including the awesome Fun-kins that last forever?  Martha will show you how.

  Do Ya wanna give Trick-or Treaters a Halloween Candy Bowl scare that will scar them for life and have them in therapy indefinitely? Martha has you covered.

  Do Ya wanna make some easy, glow in the dark Spiders? These eight boots were made for walkin' baby!

  Do ya wanna see Martha dressed as a pirate (AARGH, that thar Marth be the sexiest pirate me eyes ever did behold) and see her threaten a peon that she will make them ""walk the plank"" if they don't get her craft right? It's here baby! It's here.

  Do Ya wanna make cool Bats out of clothespins?  Thought it couldn't be done? Thought clothespins were just for hanging clothes or attaching to your nose when your gassy uncle came for the family reunion? Think again, Einstein.

  Do Ya wanna see some poor kid humiliated by being forced to wear a ""Chicken outfit"" while clucking? Now we know the answer to that question: ""Why did the chicken cross the road""?  Because they wanted to get to the other side of the street, where some trees blocked the view of would be onlookers who would lay an egg laughing at their funny chicken suit.

  Do Ya want all sorts of cool (and some spooky) ways to enjoy Halloween?  Get this DVD.

  Do Ya wanna just relax and have a good time, and have your own private Halloween party anytime of year? Get this DVD, put it in the DVD player, and press play.

  And let the party begin!",1295395200,4,2100,4.4813829787234045
8126435,5,B000FTCLTE,"This dvd is classic old school Martha before she went Hollywood on us with live audiences and movie stars.

This dvd is the best of her Halloween segments, filmed in her old studio with Halloween music and great set design.

Also recommended are all of her holiday dvd's as well as summer.",1269043200,,289,4.538461538461538
