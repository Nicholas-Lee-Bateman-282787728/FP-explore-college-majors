8560756,5,B00B1FMZHY,"The video supplements the course I teach on the Old Testament very well.  The students really enjoy seeing how the actual places they have read about in the Bible look today. I like that the segments are done by person in the Bible, so I can use this as we cover each person.",1390003200,,275,4.188679245283019
8560757,5,B00B1FMZHY,"This report from the Middle East compares Christianity to Muslim and Jewish faiths.  It is very interesting, and also very neutral- no partiality is showed to any of the faiths.  Lots of history and filmed right in the Holy Land.",1389484800,,229,4.7

1. Every tribe has a creation story based on their premitive obserations. Some of them are more fantastic than others. Read the Genesis and you will find many inconsistancies. For example, God made man and woman according to his own image and told them to go multiple. Then God forgot about them and created Adam and Eve to live among animals but did not tell them to multiple. After God expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden, they just went elsewhere, met other people created by someone else, and had children.

2. There were farmers and cities all over Mesopotamia since 4500 BC and conflicts with restless nomads were often. Farmers thought herders were barbarians and herders thought farmers slaves. There were songs of Inanna loves farmers and songs of Ishtar loves herders. Of course the nomadic Israelites claimed God preferred Abel the herder over Cain the farmer. Daddy loves me best!

3. Israelites were a small wondering nomadic tribe who may or may not have went to Egypt during the frequent Asiatic migrations when there was famine in Syria-Palestine. Egyptians kept very detailed historical records and there was no mention of Joseph or Moses. Besides, Moses is not a name, it's a title during the New Kingdom, i.e. Ah-moses, Ra-moses, Thut-moses. And the story of Moses being pulled from the river in a reed basket is a straight pleigerism from the Akkadian story of Sargon the Great (2500 BC) which the Jews may have picked up during their captivity in Babylon. And it was Moses, the ""prince of Egypt"" who formulated Judaism based on his understanding of Akhanatan's monotheism.

4. Some snake venim sends people into a trance so some old religions think snakes are the messengers of gods. It was often used as one of the divination methods. And as snakes shed their skins, they were viewed as immortal thus making them special for the premitive people. When the Israelites returned to Canaan, many defected to the local religions. The Israelite priests, zealots, bigots, and prophets, not only had to make the local gods impetent idols but also make snakes the devil in an effort to stem the defection.

5. God was an angry vengeful violent intolerant self-centered and arbitrary tyrant without any redeeming value in the Old Testament while all the other gods of other regions were a ""family"" (some got along better than others). No wonder while various people accept all the other gods, they rejected this self-righterous small-minded jealous one as unworthy to be god. Read the Old Testament and it will make you sick with indignation. Watch the move ""God on Trial"", it's the  most intelligent explanation of what's going on with the old Judaism and how modern Jews (during WWII) try to cope with it.

6. The Israelites took advantage of the short lull between major empires and formed a small kingdom in 800 BC that lasted only 200 years. That's why they dreamed of a Messiah. Some even claimed that Cyrus the Great was a Messiah, not knowing that he released all deportees back to their homelands and helped them rebuild their temples to keep subjugated people content and obedient. Many had claimed to be the Messiah, that's why it was such a bothersome business to the Roman governor and the old Jewish establishment. We didn't tolerate Jim Jones or David Korash any more than the Romans and the Jews did with the many self-proclaimed Messiahs.

7. Christian faith survived because some of Jesus's desciples went to the gentiles. The Roman Church was a creation of Peter and Paul and the Greek Church a creation of John. With the help of a few crafty Roman popes in the Dark Age, they gained control of Italy after Western Roman Empire collapsed. They went about persecuting all religions and massacred everyone who disagreed with them with a vengence worse than anything the world had ever seen before. Then they build churches over old holy sites to prevent the revival of old religions.

8. After Constantine proclaimed Christianity the state religion, he sent his mother Helene to the holy land for a pilgrimage to identify the holy sites. Recognizing a fat cow to be milked, the local people showed her whatever she wanted to know. The business of pilgrimage and selling relics boomed ever since. Whatever you want, they've got it, for a price of course.

9. The Bible never said Jesus was born on 12/25. 12/25 was the birthday of Mithra, the old sun god of Persia, who was popular among the Roman soldiers and foreign merchants. And winter solstice was ""Saturnalia"" for the Romans and a holiday when anything goes. Christians took advantage of the chaos to celebrate. But it was still not the birthday of Jesus until St. Francis of Assis asked a nativity scene to be played for him. It became popular in Europe but it was never recognized by the Orthodox Christians as the birthday of Jesus.

10. Mohammud had great respect for the successful rich and learned Jews in his community. Linking up with the story of Ismael, he modeled himself on Moses and revealed his revelations based on the Jewish teachings. Because both Judaism and Christianity were closed and intolerant (the Jews were a guarded group of ""chosen people"" and Jesus was the ""only son"" of God), they both rejected him and denied his new revelations, thus setting up the continuous religious conflicts for supremacy. Closing the door like the Jews and the Christians did before them, the Muslims proclaimed Mohammud ""the last prophet"" so they too get to persecute anyone who disagree with them.

Our modern understanding of Christianity and Christmas were born in the Victorian era. That's the ""beginning"". But as the saying goes, ""For the faithful, no proof is necessary. For the nonbeliever, no proof is enough.""",1387929600,2,5916,4.869781312127237
8560759,5,B00B1FMZHY,"I think is an excellent program with many mistakes made by CNN. I set up the DVR to record the show because  I was going out but only the first hour holds the Name ""Back to the beginning"" and the following 4 chapters, that were showing continuously they have other program names, so it did not record them! What a Bo-Bo CNN!
Are you planning to show the series again!
