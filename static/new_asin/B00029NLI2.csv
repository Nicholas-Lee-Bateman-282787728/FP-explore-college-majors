This dvd changed my buttocks after doing it a coup0le times,.  My butt is perky and looks so good.  I am happy about that because I look good in jeans.",1364342400,2,223,4.0227272727272725
8024406,5,B00029NLI2,This is a great core workout. I have increased my strength and stability by using it for the last several months!,1357862400,2,113,4.428571428571429
8024407,3,B00029NLI2,"First of all, keep in mind that this is a repackaged workout; it has been marked as both ""Core Essentials"" and ""Pilates Core Essentials.""  This is definitely not a Pilates workout, so maybe that was part of the reason for the name change. Rather, it is a full-body toning workout similar to the first half of one of instructor Karen Voight's other videos, Streamline Fitness.

The workout begins with a simple, 4 minute warm-up to get your body moving; this is followed by 8 minutes of standing strength moves. The exercises consist of traditional squats and crunches, but Karen makes them unique by adding more movement. Although her cuing is excellent, the variety of the moves is a little hard to follow upon first viewing of the video, but you do get the hang of it. One problem I had with this section is regarding how Karen uses the arms: the arm movements often seem unnecessary and mismatched to the leg work.  The main body of this workout occurs on the floor. Karen continues the legwork with extensions done both on all fours and on the side; she sometimes uses her weighted ""genie balls""--you could also substitute ankle weights, but I found the moves to be challenging enough without the added weight!  She then targets the arms with a tough push-ups sequence as well as several exercises with dumbbells. The workout ends with abs and back exercises followed by a 6 minute cool down.

As always, Karen offers meticulous tips on form throughout. This was an average-to-good workout (I'd actually have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could), but I prefer Karen's Streamline Fitness, which offers additional arm work, a tougher abs section, and relaxing yoga moves as well.",1183852800,8,1677,4.768965517241379
8024408,5,B00029NLI2,"""I'll show you how to minimize wasted energy while maximizing concentration on the targeted muscles of your core essentials."" ~ Karen Voight

In ""Core Plus More,"" Karen Voight presents a workout to target the core muscle groups. She also focuses on the arms and legs by using weights to increase the intensity. The added resistance increases your efforts so on exercises for the abs, holding weights above the head while doing a crunches makes them super effective. As always Karen emphasizes proper form to optimize your results. The main sections of the workout include:

Aerobics - Warm up

Legs & Butt 10 minutes

Arms, Back & Torso 5 minutes

Abdominals 10 minutes

Cool down - Stretch

The workout begins with a brief aerobics section to warm up the muscles then moves right into leg exercises inspired by Pilates. She uses her green genies (weighted balls) to increase the resistance. The main workout is on a round blue platform and she is wearing a ruby outfit so the colors are interesting.

During the Arms, Back & Torso workokut she does quite a few sets of push-ups which I found challenging when combined with Plank. Next you use weights while you are on your back and then move into a cool down with unique side stretches and plenty of attention to stretching out the legs.

Overall, I'd say this is a challenging workout with unique exercises. Karen Voight's teaching style is very precise so the cueing is always excellent and you feel like you have completed a calorie-burning workout with an artistic appeal.

8024409,5,B00029NLI2,"Each of Karen's workouts are gems.  They provide enough toughness to be beneficial and yet through her clear instruction and great cuing, it's easy to follow and very motivating.  This is another one of her gems.  It's a great flowing workout that is done to develop lean muscles and good healthy joint mobility.  Some positions may be a little tricky to get yourself into, but with each go, you'll improve and it will be easier.  She always gives clear and precise instructions so you know what's coming up next without straining to look at the tv all the time.
This works all the core muscles - abs, back, [...], arms and legs.  There is nice jazz type music in the background that isn't annoying and helps you keep in rythym.  You'll need weights for this but it's so worth your while doing this because there are so many people who forget to stretch and strengthen muscles - we think that cardio is all we need.  This is so relaxing to do and beneficial that I recommend it to everyone.",1145664000,5,990,4.4916201117318435
8024410,5,B00029NLI2,"I have to give this DVD 5 stars for its wonderful uniqueness!  I am always searching for DVDs that give a new spin on toning exercizes - and this definitely fits the bill.  I truly feel that in order to continually shape and define your muscels, you need to find different ways to move your muscels.  And in addition to being unique, the moves and combinations are also challenging - you can feel the burn.  It's a fantastic workout at a great price!",1116892800,7,450,4.385542168674699
