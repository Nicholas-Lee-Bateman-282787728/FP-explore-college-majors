4159238,5,B003NIANM6,"The DVD and the two ebooks are really excellent. I purchased this product because I did not want to try the rites from pictures.  Being a fitness instructor, I know that a person can get injuries without proper person-to-person instruction whether in the classroom or on-screen. Ms. Witt is very thorough with the breathing component as well as the rites. I am very pleased that I was able to locate such good instruction. Additionally, her annotated copy version of Kelder's book gives much clarity. I'm sure Kedler would be happy with her knowledge and skill as it is  applied to his Tibetan discovery.",1304208000,,604,4.854368932038835

The customer service has been fantastic and the video and book are excellent an informative. I continue to get stronger, younger, and more balanced each day. I am very happy that I found this wonderful teacher after seeing her on youtube. I would highly recommend this for anyone no matter your physical condition. You will improve with daily practice.",1285718400,3,498,4.940476190476191
4159240,5,B003NIANM6,"I am a professional Corporate Trainer and am extremely impressed with the instruction in this DVD. I have never done any form of exercise like this before, but I found learning the movements with this DVD really easy to follow.
I felt confident when I realised that the teacher had so much experience.
I have had a number of sports injuries and I when I first heard about the Five Tibetans I was concerned that I would be somehow pushed into movements that I was not ready for - but I need not have worried.  This excellent DVD breaks each movement down into smaller steps so I can be sure about how to place my neck or how high to raise my legs etc.
I liked the fact that I could learn the Rites step-by-step in an uncluttered studio setting and then when I felt ready, I could simply move to a track and follow along with the instructor as they did their repetitions accompanied by very clear verbal instructions.
I can't imagine a better way of learning The Five Tibetan Rites and really enjoyed the settings as well as the music on two of the tracks.  I am very motivated to continue with this practice as I feel totally confident that I can do this correctly over the long term with this DVD.
I found the accompanying e-booklet a great easy reference tool if I had any special questions about my practice.  For example I am unable to lift my legs straight in to the air due to stiffness, and I simply referred to the booklet to find the answer in both the short-term and the long-term.  A very useful tool indeed.
I had an unexpected bonus when I discovered I could also improve my breathing by doing the suggested exercises on this DVD.  My energy and vitality has improved dramatically as has my strength and flexibility.",1280361600,36,1728,4.421383647798742
4159241,5,B003NIANM6,"This is the best DVD on the 5 Rites that exist in the market today.
It contains a well thought step by step 5 Rites demonstrations to prevent accidents and alternatives to practitioners with physical limitations.
No doubt that the experience of Carolinda Witt in teaching the Rites to thousands of students, her skills as a Yoga teacher and her experts' advisors from chiropractics to breathing and spine experts contributed to this unique masterpiece DVD.
The DVD enables anyone who is interested in getting the benefits of the Five Rites to accomplish his/her goal and overcome deficiencies they have in their body, muscles and spine.
I would like to add that I was very impressed from the aesthetic of the production, the attention to details and the knowledge that was demonstrated in this DVD.

I have been doing this style of T5T for close to ten years and have enjoyed the benefits immensely. The DVD is an excellent addition to the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore an easy, safe and yet uncompromising form of exercise.

This is the best on the market for doing the 5 rites and it's an affordable gift for family and friends who're too lazy to attend classes!",1280275200,44,626,4.3418803418803416

Together with the two bonus pdf books that come along with the DVD, I think the package will benefit greatly those who do not have enough time for long and strenuous exercises. T5T, is the way to go. With only ten minutes of your time each day you will start feeling great and at the same time feel younger and look younger. I strongly recommend. Logistically, the DVD arrived on time.

As a beginner,  it not only shows me the correct way to do the rite,  but it also showed some ways to ease into each exercise in a way designed to prevent injury as I get strong enough to do the moves full out. It's quite nice doing the movements along with the videos.  I sent an email because of one question I had and to my surprise Carolinda herself replied. I honestly don't feel as if my review does the product justice. I've never been one to buy this type of video,  but in this case,  it was a great decision.",1409616000,11,555,4.101851851851852

Watching this CD has given me new enthusiasm to get back into the practice, and it's SO much better to learn from an experienced teacher who can explain things clearly and simply. I also appreciate that Carolinda has done her own research to get some clarity on the somewhat murky origins of this tradition. So, I think that whether you're just getting interested or have already started, this is kind of a must-have. Happy practicing!",1399334400,2,601,4.472727272727273

Finally these ancient Tibetans rites have been made available and brought into the modern age whilst keeping to their original core essence, sprit and authenticity. Carolida has made a superb effort to create a system for practising these powerful rites safely , effectively and  gradually.
The inclusion of the concepts of creating inner core strength and stability and the introduction of a simple yet powerful breathing techniques makes this process of learning and practising the Rites clearly standout from the rest of the books on the Tibetan Rites currently in the market.
The systematic way the Rites are taught with the use of the DVD and its companion book makes this a through introduction for the novice as well as those who have been practising the rites for many years,",1387756800,,792,5.0458015267175576

4159313,5,B003NIANM6,"It has taken me some time to write this review because of a summer vacation that led to some back & neck injuries/pain. I was slow to want to try anything physical, so I spent more time with the breathing portion in the beginning. I found this study relaxing and confidence building. Subsequent slow progression through the warm-ups and exercises has made a positive difference in my body's adapting to the movements and I could feel my body's aches and pains easing. I have grown to appreciate and enjoy doing the Five Tibetan Rites, feeling an increased, supple strength that I haven't experienced in a long time.
The pacing and explanations were excellent, along with the references to the e-book for any problems you might encounter. I highly recommend this package, especially if you haven't been active in a while, or are recovering from some injury. I found this to be very therapeutic and rewarding!",1385856000,3,907,4.858064516129033
4159323,5,B003NIANM6,"I received the DVD and e-books several months ago and actually had to wait to start them due to a non-related injury.  I have been trained in somatic  (body oriented) therapies and was delighted to find T5T.  Before I say a bit about the DVD, I would like to note that I have sent and received several emails to/from Carolinda Witt with questions in connection with starting the Rites.  I have found her very responsive and very knowledgeable.  One of the qualities I look for in a teacher is that he/she embody his/her work and Carolinda, without doubt, does that.  You will find a natural peacefulness in her presence, along with years of knowledge, which contribute greatly to the overall DVD.  She has taken considerable effort to make the Rites easy to learn and safe for all who follow her clear instructions.

  Carolinda gives an excellent summary of the DVD in the beginning and takes care to make the Rites understandable.  For instance, the energy breathing is carefully broken down into three achievable steps, then put together to make a complete breath.  The instructions for the Rites are both verbal and visual.  The cinematography and locations give a relaxing backdrop for instruction.

  One of the things that is so helpful with the DVD is that it demonstrates the Rites for the beginner all the way through to the advanced student. The Rites are shown for each individual week up to Week 10 by which time you are capable of doing them without added help or modification.  It is also of note that the Rites are demonstrated by people of several different ages and thereby offer core development and the potential of increased energy to adults of many ages.  At the age of 62, I can testify to the importance of having a strong core and a vibrant energy field.

  I would highly recommend the T5T DVD for all those that would like to improve their overall health and fitness. I can definitely feel the difference in terms of energy once I have finished!",1383955200,6,1972,4.690962099125365
4159324,5,B003NIANM6,"Carolinda has put together an incredible and easy to understand presentation on the 5 Rites.

I heard about the Rites years ago.. but never really understood them until receiving Carolinda's program. It's easy to follow with the videos and accompanying Ebooks and Teaching Guides. This program will truly help you feel younger and be in better health.. both physically and spiritually. Where else could you find that in just a few minutes a day? I am very impressed with this series and recommend it to anyone looking for this information in an easy to understand (and put into practice) format.

4159325,5,B003NIANM6,"Carolinda Witt's T5T program has taken an ancient form of Tibetan Yoga and adapted it for modern users by incorporating modern techniques of exercise science, kinesiology and athletic training.
I have used the basic Five Tibetan Rites, as seen on many You-Tube videos, several times over the past few years with good success, however, it does not compare with the quality of success that I have attained by following the T5T program.  The benefits for me have been: increased flexibility; more energy throughout the day; better posture and a feeling of ease while standing, walking or sitting; a more positive outlook that is sustainable; and looking forward to my daily T5T session.
I would recommend the T5T program to practically anyone that wants to improve their health and fitness levels.  It is easy to learn and easy to incorporate into any schedule. T5T has become an integral component of my life and wellness plan.

4159329,5,B003NIANM6,"I used to practice the Five Tibetans twenty years ago and loved them, but I was plagued with persistent neck and lower back soreness that ultimately made me stop.  Now, with an older body, I'm using the DVD by Carolinda Witt and not having any issues with soreness.  Her careful, slow approach has helped me ease into the practice avoiding much of the stress I used to feel from practicing too aggressively.  I am feeling much stronger physically, more grounded, more resilient and interested in life.  My mind is sharper and my metabolism has sped up.
A very interesting side benefit for me is that it is helping me with an environmental sensitivity called electrosensitivity which I've experienced now for several years.  Especially affected by wireless signals, doing a lot of normal activities in the world became frightening and painful as the amount of wireless technology has proliferated.  I notice since I've been using Carolinda's program pretty regularly I'm clearly less sensitive to wireless.  It's probably not the only thing contributing to the improvement, but I feel strengthened in more ways than just additional muscular strength, and it feels like an inner ability to normalize from external stress is part of that.  I'm so grateful for the support.
I have to say also that any questions I've had have been answered quickly and thoroughly and with great care by Carolinda, and it's clear that her heart is in being of real service to her customers.  I feel grateful to have found her on the internet one day and pursued her work.",1379203200,6,1549,4.904214559386973

Performing these exercises provides peacefulness and physical strength. When I started doing the Tibetan rites I started with the 21 repetitions and remember being sore in my abdomen for a few days.

I still do the first rite in the morning for I gives me energy, since I worked from 6 AM to 2 PM. Then I received this DVD and the e book. It explains every rite, how to do it correctly; just like making sure that your elbow crease is facing front and having your pelvic and tummy in the right position when doing the exercise. And it also teaches you how to strengthen your weak muscles just like my wrist, which now is doing better. I am proud to say that I am doing now the 5 rites and my shoulders are doing better and wrists getting stronger. Thanks so much for this DVD.

4159361,4,B003NIANM6,"Many 5 Tibetian Rites or yoga videos/ DVDs claim to be for beginners or all levels actually assume quite a bit of familiarity with special terms, poses or some level of fitness to perform, making them inappropriate for true beginners. The T5T video guides people who don't have those skills but motivation to try out the Five Rites. It is encouraging and shows step-by-step how to exercise your body so one can do the Rites without injuries. This DVD will help you to build a safe practice from the ground up.
But because each person's needs and tastes are so different, what works best for me might be completely inappropriate, irritating, or boring to you. I started practicing the Five Rites back in 2004 with my yoga and qi gong (ch'i kung) teacher Dima and he was keen to explain details on how the exercises work and how to perform them properly. Therefore, the T5T system reached me later and ... it is difficult to skip comparisons.
While I still strongly believe that the best way to learn the Rites and yoga is from a good teacher, the DVD will fit to new beginners and from there one can build up the knowledge about oriental exercise practices in the comfort of their own homes.
Reflecting on what others said about the DVD... well, we all have different expectations and not all of them can be met. I'd prefere having no background music at all as I don't need any entertainment and am perfectly ok with silence and my own thoughts. But that is so easy to fix just by muting the device.

I particularly like the emphasis on breathing and the development of the core muscles, so necessary for a healthy spine.  I give patients the poster and some tips for doing the rites, but now I will direct them to the website and the complete study program.

I am amazed at the strength and energy 5T has given me as well as the balance ( from the spinning ).

Well, I was in for a bit of a shock when I started to incorporate the 5T's into my regime. The strength required for these series of exercises is paramount after the first time I executed them. And my strength kept improving week after week. But it didn't stop there. The effects on the mind are very powerful. Such clarity!

4159399,5,B003NIANM6,"The Tibetan rituals have existed for decades because they WORK.  If you are older, or easing into a fitness routine, this is the way to go.  I didn't exercise much last winter since I was so pressed for time.  However, I started doing these exercises because I could do them at home and it wasn't time consuming. I couldn't complete the required repetitions for a few weeks, but slowly built my way up.  They provided muscle toning and flexibility and were a great way to keep in shape.  Besides those benefits, I also increased my sense of balance, a factor you don't often see addressed in many fitness tapes.  The older you are, the more important to work at your body balance.

My body feels much more flexible, relaxed and my posture improved as well. Most importantly to me is the energy boost I get more doing the rites. We have a one year old who had a terrible time sleeping for the first 9 months of his life (up every 1-2 hours for 9 months). Doing the rites every morning were a lifesaver to help me regain clarity and function at work despite being sleep deprived.

I can't report any miraculous changes but slow gradual changes over time that seem to keep building on each other. I've noticed a general trend to eat more healthy foods, a calmer demeanor and just more happy in general.

4159428,3,B003NIANM6,"My experience with the first DVD I received was negative and I came to learn that it was just due to a defective DVD.  Carolinda was very responsive and her customer service was impeccable.  I recently received a replacement DVD that did not have the defects of the first one.  I will begin with the positive and hopefully end on a positive note as this is someone's life's work and I respect that.  The instructions are beyond clear and cleanly filmed in pleasant surroundings and with a great deal of intentionality and focus.  As someone who is older, a bit overweight, and who has read the original book and practiced the rites without needing much adaptation, the performance of the rites both in the section where one is 'learning the rites' and in 'week 1' seem overly prolonged, therefore(for me)it's a frustrating pace.  I also expected that there would be someone on screen performing the repetitions of the rites with me for weeks 2-10 and that is just not so.  It is not a follow-along DVD, it is not meant that way and so, it is probably my 'fail' for not reading the product detail closely enough (if in fact this was explained there).  It would have been oh so much more helpful to me to click on Week 2 and do the rites along with a teacher for 5 reps, and so on with each subsequent week, rather than have someone model only the rites that have adaptations.  I will undoubtedly make good use of the reading materials included, but the video is, as I've titled this review, 'not what I expected' and not something I will use. The final session, where 21 reps are performed, does exactly what I thought I would be enjoying on a weekly basis.",1371513600,14,1656,4.493333333333333

I did start to view my dvd yesterday, but now with the e-books, I'll just feel more confident. Again thank you very much. At first my star rating of my experience with the The Five Tibetans: An Expert Teacher's Insider Secrets Revealed was a three, but now it is a very enthusiastic 5-star rating. I am really looking forward to becoming more fit and energetic.",1336348800,3,675,4.322834645669292
4159445,5,B003NIANM6,"First the praise:

J. Carpenter is a brilliant reviewer who must make Amazon executives chest thumping proud of their entire review system.  Asked by a friend to take a look at one of his reviews, I ended up reading all of his reviews and, by the time you read this, will have ordered two of his recommendations.  Carpenter is a wonderful writer with a wonderfully acerbic wit.  His reviews are just plain fun.

Carpenter has reviewed Carolinda Witt's CD, ""The Five Tibetans: An Expert Teacher's Insider Secrets Revealed,"" along with Christopher Kilham's book, ""The Five Tibetans: Five Dynamic Exercises for Health, Energy, and Personal Power."" In these reviews, Carpenter also summarizes my book (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-EYE-OF-REVELATION-The-Ancient-Tibetan-Rites-of-Rejuvenation/dp/1601454198/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE EYE OF REVELATION: The Ancient Tibetan Rites of Rejuvenation</a>""), and states its purpose better and more succinctly than I could have.

Oh, sure, some will argue that I am being fulsome in praising Carpenter only because he was generous with his praise of my book.  Scientific research has determined, however, that those making such claims are usually of low birth.

And now the defense:

Even though we live on separate continents, I have come to know and respect Carolinda Witt.  She is both a colleague and a friend who is dedicated to the preservation of the original instructions for the Five Rites.  That said, Carolinda's approach to the Rites is different from mine  -- to which I say, ""Great.""  My book is a reprint of the ""lost"" 1946 edition of the ""Eye of Revelation,"" and a major purpose was to preserve the 1946 so others could test and revise the Rites (if found necessary or beneficial).  The problem with many modern reprints of Kelder's classic work is that changes were made without actually informing the reader of those changes.  In some cases, serious errors and omissions were made and fictitious quotes attributed to Kelder were inserted.

Carolinda, on the other hand, has been up front and open about her approach to the Rites.  She not only informs the reader of changes she has made, she also explains in detail the why of those changes.  Her approach is honest and scholarly.  I just wish that others would follow her lead.  No, I don't agree with everything she has done, but that's not the point.  The point is that she is honest.

About a year ago, I began having problems with severe upper back and neck pains with doing Rite 2.  Often I would just have to stop with the Rites for the day.  The problem was getting worse so I pulled Carolinda's T5T book off the shelf to see what she had to say about this.  Her recommendation was to use a pillow with Rite 2 and I have done so ever since without a single reoccurrence of the neck or back pain.  So, I know the value of her work.

Bear in mind that Carolinda and I are actually competitors for Five Rites dollars, yet I am giving her five stars.  If at all possible, I hope that J. Carpenter will revise his rating upwards as he thinks appropriate.",1320796800,4,3111,4.976744186046512
4159446,5,B003NIANM6,"The Five Tibetan Rites have a reputation for being the fountain of youth, and they were my baptism of fire into Yoga, I did a one-day workshop in Sydney about 4 years ago, and did the exercises for 6 months, building up to 21 repetitions of the rites.

During that phase I felt my core muscles build up helping my posture in general, as well as a better, deeper, fuller, slower breathing pattern, and more energy in general. When I first did the training, only the book and an audio CD was available, now a complete comprehensive DVD package is available. I moved away from the Five Rites and more towards traditional Yoga and Qi Gong. Somehow you body knows what it needs, and I revisited the Rites again by getting the updated DVD program, now I could look at the Rites again, but this time with a new perspective and understanding of Yoga and Qi Gong.

Most of us are not yogis or monks and in this day and age, we live stressful lives, we have poor postures, we have poor diets, we have poor breathing patterns. We have little time for exercise and spiritual fulfillment; we rely on addictive band aid health care solutions to fill in the gaps. Carolinda seems to understand this and provides a week by week progression building up to the whole rites after a period of 10 weeks.

The DVD comes with two E-Books (The Original Eye of Revelation book both the 1939 and 1946 version combined) and detail supplementary 82 page course material. It is particularly well structured. I particularly liked how the rites are taught in a detail incremental week by week progression, the integrated energy breathing technique, the warm-up exercises and the affirmations.

Detailed Week by Week Progression
Looking at the DVD I must say it is a thorough, detailed, step-by-step, week by week explanation on how to do the rites correctly. From Qi Gong, I know that ""forms"" evolve over years getting better and better as generations improve it. Carolinda has certainly evolved the rites, however still keeping true to the original essence and form, but adapting it to today's environment, considerations and lifestyle.

There is great attention to detail in the instructions given; this is a prime example on how to do a proper training course without the aid of any physical instructor. The author is quite active on her Facebook page and seems to be very responsive on any questions raised. She also maintains a very informative blog site [...] which has a wealth of free material on the rites.

A week by week program is provided, allowing one to build up to the strength, flexibility and focus slowly, which is required to do the rites properly over 10 weeks. For example the leg raises start with 1 leg at a time, breaking down the sequence from the breathing, to the first head movement, then the single leg movement up, the flex of the leg straight up.
The author focuses on alignment, awareness, breaking down the steps and sequencing them into smaller learning elements, then bringing all elements together incrementally. Particularly key is the focus on safety, as the rites done wrongly without developing the strength and flexibility first could be unsafe. Even steps on how to get down and get up are covered.
I liked the intermixing of various other elements of yoga to the original rites, for example rocking on the back before the leg raises, and the cat and cow pose after the leg raises in the week 1 training. The pendulum uses both the down dog and the up dog as a base to build the more dynamic pendulum movement.

The Integrated Energy Breathing Technique
The energy breathing is based on the complete yogic breath, including the diaphragms, the rib cage and the clavicles, the good thing is that it is not forced, a relaxed breath is emphasized, no breath should be ever forced, as subtle pranic elements are associated with the breath. I like the way the breathing is combined into the core stability ""tight jeans"" exercise, I have never quite seen the pelvic floor incorporated into a breathing exercise before.

The Warm up Exercises
I really like the warm up exercises. I feel they can be used separately by themselves. The shaking and tapping seem like they have been borrowed from Qi Gong. In Qi Gong they use shaking to expel negative Qi, I feel that this mental visualization can be adopted while doing the exercise. The tapping is particularly powerful exercise, these stimulate the meridian points all over the body, the demonstrations show how to do this properly, even getting to difficult to reach places such as the lower back.
On the warm up exercise with the spinal twist, according to Qi Gong a twist should be done moving from the waist.

The Affirmations
The affirmations are a particularly powerful compliment to the exercises. I feel that you could probably use these affirmations by themselves and they would still be useful. I think an audio affirmation track to do the rites would be very valuable.  These are:

- I am flexible and receptive
- My mind is clear and calm
- I am full of energy
- I am strong and balanced
- I am positive and motivated

Overall Review
Overall the rites pack a lot of punch in a 10-15 minute workout, Carolinda has improved the rites by adding a great energy stimulating warm-up, related affirmations, integrated core and breathing exercises, insider teacher tips all into a tight little package. It would be hard to get this sort of expertise in a live teacher, unless Carolinda or one of the Monks is teaching the class themselves
If you read about the rites and its reputation for being the ""Fountain of Youth"", and want to learn this, this DVD program is probably the most comprehensive instructional material available.",1316649600,39,5688,4.745951417004049
4159447,5,B003NIANM6,"The five Tibetan Rites have really helped me increase my energy, strength and flexibility.  But when I tried to do them from reading the original book, I often hurt my shoulders.  This video has three things that have made the Rites accessible to me and to everyone.

1) There is an exceptional warm up that I find useful anytime my body needs to get loose.
2) Many modifications are included so that if someone isn't strong or flexible enough to do the full exercise, s/he can do part of it safely and gradually improve to full strength.
3) It is easy to follow along.  The video includes a great section showing a group of people, each with different abilities, going through the Rites.

That reminds me of one other thing.  I'm not sure where this was filmed, but it is beautiful.

4159448,5,B003NIANM6,"I found this dvd when i was already practising the five tibetans what i  have learned by myself. I wish i had it at the beginning. It teaches you how to build up the exercises without getting injured what is very important and offers an easily understandable step by step way to learn it . What is good in it that Carolinda corrects all the possible mistakes we can do and prevents doing the exercises in a wrong way. She also adds core stability exercise and energy breathing so it makes it a more complete system.
If you have 12 mintes for yourself a day it is for sure that his is the BEST method for health keeping and sickness prevention. And what is more if you do that that after 3 months everybody will say that you look so much younger.
The dvd is really well done, the menu is very user friendly since you can search by the individual rites and warm ups as well.  A big plus to the dvd that after buying it you can get support from Carolinda through her home page what i have found and share here [...] It is a big advantage . And she answers . She corrected e.g. my breathing that it is better not only inhale through the nose but exhale as well.
I think it is a very usefull thing for those who just begin the rites now, those who want to find something for themselves and have 10 minutes a day and even for those who are doing the rites for a while and what to make a system out of it . I suggest getting it with full heart .",1314230400,22,1438,4.059859154929577
