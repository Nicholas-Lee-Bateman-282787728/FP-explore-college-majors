7832239,5,6302843812,"I live close to Vernon, Florida. I also know several people from there. I accidentally came across this movie while flipping channels, and recently purchased a copy for myself. This movie features the Good Ole' Boys, or at least that's how we refer to them around here. And yes, much of what you see in the movie is real, we really act like that around here. It's just a wonderful movie. I plan to keep this to show to my children and grandchildren when I get them. It's a great example of the way we live in south east Alabama, and in the edge of Florida.",1091318400,2,556,4.254716981132075
7832240,5,6302843812,"Errol Morris originally set out to investigate what insurance company officials called ""Nub City"", where the highest percentage of self-mutilating claims frauds resided. Deciding that the story wasn't what he was interested most in, he turned his camera on the people he met around town and simply let them be themselves: An old man who owns a raccoon which he believes to be a turtle. A pleasant couple who own a jar of sand they claim grows daily. A turkey hunter with near religious devotion to his sport; these and more folk, odd and not so odd.  A lost classic of sorts, this is only equaled by Gates of Heaven (also by Morris) for portraits of humanity in all their weird and wonderful glory. Someone PLEASE re-release these two movies.",1036281600,5,742,4.707692307692308
7832241,5,6302843812,"Maybe a warm blend of all.  While filmed in a small unsophisticated southern town, Vernon, Florida is for those with a more insightful and sophisticated sense of humor.
Some won't get it . . . for those who do, this is an enjoyable way to spend 72 minutes.",1029196800,3,256,4.333333333333333
7832242,5,6302843812,"Another great Documentary called Athens, Georgia/Inside Out was modeled after this film and it to is saddly out of print both this and Athens Georgia/Inside Out deserve 5 stars! Also check out Morris' first film ""The Gates of Heaven"", its great to!!!!",1010448000,5,251,5.0
7832243,5,6302843812,"Errol Morris is a genius and this finely crafted film is evidence of that. The fact that he typically uses only 1% of what he shoots,only heightens my respect for him and his integrity as a filmaker.",1001635200,2,199,4.405405405405405
7832244,5,6302843812,"I agree whole-heartedly that this has to be re-released.  Tosee ""Vernon"", I had to pay [additional] deposit to rent it (because of its status as out-of-print).  After watching ""Vernon"", I would have gladly exchanged the deposit for the tape.  This Errol Morris documentary is in my list of top three funniest films ever. There are so many great moments (only in fifty-five minutes)...The whole film is a highlight.  Hopefully, it will be released on DVD and include additional footage; my only complaint is that the film is too short.",989366400,7,534,4.966292134831461
7832245,5,6302843812,"I've seen this film 35+ times: I know it by heart, and each time I see and hear it (for it's a aural pleasure as much as it's a visual one), I'm struck by Errol Morris' genius for creating three-dimensional poetry.  Anyone interested in people, in the human condition, in language, in beauty, in the absurd needs to see this film.  Writers, musicians, film directors and editors -- this is a MUST-SEE for ya'll.  If artists are people who take the ordinary and transform it into the extradordinary, then Errol Morris is an artist in the first degree, and Vernon, Florida is the proof.  The people he finds are demi-gods, just waiting for the opportunity to tell their stories.  It is my sincere hope that this masterpiece become available again on VHS and DVD.  Do it, Industry.",989366400,20,778,4.642335766423358
7832246,5,6302843812,"I was forced to watch this movie over 8 years ago while in a college film class.  I am still telling people about it today.  It is one of the most true, funny films I have ever seen.  It brings a smile to my face just thinking about it.  I know people just like that in Oklahom.  They all want copies.",984009600,2,301,3.8688524590163933
7832247,5,6302843812,"I am saddened and appalled to see that this film is not currently available on video or DVD.  I mean, Christopher Guest's 'mockumentaries' are funny, but this is THE REAL THING!  It's just a bunch of people talking about their lives and their town, but it'll make you laugh until you think you might throw up.  It's the acid test for choosing friends.  If you show this to somebody and they don't think it's hilarious, don't waste any more time on them.  Somebody, please, reissue this gem so I can continue to expand my social circle.  Thanks.",979776000,18,544,4.556701030927835
