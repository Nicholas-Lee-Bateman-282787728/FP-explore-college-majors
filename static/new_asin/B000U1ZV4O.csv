2914513,5,B000U1ZV4O,"This is a great box set for those who haven't been getting the sets individually.  Concurring with other reviews here, I will say that you either get the show or you don't and if you get it, I don't have to tell you how enjoyable it is.  It may not be the most clever or smart sitcom ever made, far from it probably, but in terms of warm family fun that is rewatchable, you will be hard pressed to find any better.  For my generation there is also the added feel of nostalgia which really has only helped the show I think.  So here's to Full House-starring John Stamos, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, Lori Loughlin, Andrea Barber, Scott Weinger, and Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhout.",1189123200,16,734,4.496240601503759
2914514,5,B000U1ZV4O,I have a big fan of Full House since it dabuted in September os 1987- 1995.,1187395200,5,75,3.75
2914515,5,B000U1ZV4O,"If you are an avid ""Full House"" fan and/or a ""child of the 90's"" who watched the show regularly while it was on the air, then chances are pretty good that you have been loyally collecting the DVD's as they have been released season-by-season (at a remarkably quick pace, I might add). The individual sets have maintained a very reasonable selling price--no more than $22 or $23 at most places--so if you've grown up as a Tanner fan, then these have probably been tough to pass up.

Now, of course, if you've purchased the first 6 seasons and are patiently waiting for the last two, now you have another decision to make. Will you simply buy seasons 7 and 8 individually once they come out, or will you cave in to this deluxe full-series edition that has been penciled in for a November 2007 release? For some, it will be worth placing on your Christmas list this year, but for others, they will have no problem keeping the sets that they have already begun collecting. When these DVD companies go for the appealing ""complete series"" gift sets that are treated to more efficient packaging and (sometimes) garnished with some new special features, it's basically a matter of preference--and in many cases, it's tough to say no.

As for me, I am happy with the season sets that I have now, and I am looking forward to picking up the last two, so I don't plan on shelling out over $200 for this (partly because I also have my eye on a similar release being planned for ""Gilmore Girls""). However, if you love ""Full House"" and think you would enjoy owning this, then it looks like it might be a decent investment. Again, the specifics on the bonus features are still unknown, and although I personally don't expect that they'll add anything new for this collection, I suppose anything is possible. Some things to look for, though, include a fancy episode guide, cast photos from over the years, and things along those lines.

If you're reading this, then you most likely know the premise of this show, but in short, it is a sweet, simple, and deliciously saccharine story of a widowed father who enlists in the help of his best friend and rock-n-rollin' brother-in-law to help him raise his three daughters, who ranged from infancy to age 10 when the series premiered in 1987. You've got superachieving oldest daughter DJ, perky middle child Stephanie, and the ever-adorable (yet occasionally bratty) Michelle, the ""baby of the family,"" if you will, whose cute smile and professionally scripted catch phrases (think ""You got it dude"" and ""Whoa baby"") made young actresses Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen a necessary staple in the show's success.

Beyond the antics and plights of the growing Tanner kids, ""Full House"" maintained the attention of its target audience by producing sensitively written stories, with a twinge of humor and family-oriented messages sprinkled in each 30-minute episode. The three leading men (played by Bob Saget, John Stamos, and Dave Coulier) always worked well together, and as a slew of new characters gradually found their way into the plot, the charm was never lost.

Let's face it, though--there are a lot of people who will gladly take any opportunity they can find to bash this show, and if you've watched any of the episodes, you can probably guess what they don't like. The good news, however, is that given the impressive 8-year run that ""Full House"" achieved--as well as the plentiful television reruns and remarkable success in DVD sales--the critics' opinion just doesn't matter. If you have enjoyed this show, then the soupy plot threads and themes of family unity are probably right up your alley. There's no reason to be ashamed of it; this was a great series, filled with memorable performances, a youthful spirit, and a genuine wholesomeness that you can proudly watch with the whole family. It's nice that there is still something out there that children can see--something that can send out a positive message, reminding them that those common human values are still important.

With that being said, if the idea of having ""Full House"" immortalized on DVD sounds good to you, then you might want to save up for this set. Even if you've started buying the other sets and just like the idea of having this special edition collector's item, then go ahead--start setting aside your money, or ask for it when Christmas rolls around (hard to believe that time of year is arriving once again). Either way, this is a show that is certainly worth remembering, and if you're looking for something that satisfies your need for both humor and poignancy, there is perhaps nothing that fits the bill better than this!",1186358400,76,4641,4.809523809523809

2915013,5,B000U1ZV4O,"I grew up watching ""Full House"" and loved it for the most part. It was interesting to see an unconventional, but overall very loving family depicted, having real-life issues (at least as much as could be dealt with in a half hour episode, or the occasional two-parter). I was in between the ages of the oldest daughter, Donna Jo aka DJ Tanner (Candace Cameron) and middle child Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) so I identified with them both at different times. The baby of the family, Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) was adorable in the first few seasons, but she later became a rather know-it-all brat, reminding me of my own sister, and that grated on my nerves. Still, it's nice to re-watch the show and recall a time when sitcoms and television in general were funny and entertaining, but still family-friendly and not full of crude jokes and sexual innuendo. ""Full House"" lasted eight seasons, proving that it did have a lot of appeal.

Danny Tanner (Bob Saget, father of three daughters in real life), suffers a terrible tragedy when his wife, Pam, dies in an accident caused by a drunk driver. He asks his brother-in-law, Jesse Cochran, later Katsopolis, (John Stamos) and his best friend, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to move in with him and help him raise his children. This adds an interesting and very funny dynamic as all three men are very clueless (especially in the first season) regarding running a household and caring for small children. The pilot episode where Jesse and Joey are left alone with the girls and have to change Michelle's diaper for the first time is very memorable. While Danny is a loving and sometimes, irritatingly over-protective father, and kind of nerdy, he is the glue that holds the family together, even if his neat- freak routine is over the top. The rapport that the kids have with Jesse and Joey is very special, as both, especially Joey, are just big kids themselves. Jesse, with his daredevil reputation, rock star ambitions (accentuated by the actor's real-life musical talent) and occasionally bossy and grouchy exterior, is actually a gentle, sensitive soul who adores his family, and the girls know that he his always there for them. It was also evident in his relationship with Becky Donaldson (Lori Loughlin), the co-host of Danny's television show, ""Wake Up, San Francisco"", who would become Jesse's wife and the mother of their twin boys, Nicki and Alex (Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit). Joey, a struggling stand-up comedian, is reflective of Coulier's real-life background and his impressions and love for cartoons is also a hoot to watch. The family dog, Comet, is a welcome addition and has his own special and welcome scene-stealing moments.

The girls go through the normal stages of adjusting to the loss of their mother, having to share a bedroom (DJ and Stephanie at the beginning, and later, Steph and Michelle become roomies), making the transitions from elementary school to junior high and high school, crushes, peer pressure, etc. DJ, being the eldest, is the first to experience most of these, and in the later seasons has a boyfriend named Steve (Scott Weinger), who is a seemingly bottomless pit but is charming and cute, and her somewhat eccentric best friend, Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber), is also the next-door neighbor, and while she is often treated as an annoyance by the rest of the Tanner clan, she is oddly endearing and lovable.

Of course, no series is perfect, and ""Full House"" is no exception. It can be a bit saccharine and corny at times; there are, inevitably, continuity errors (glaringly how Danny suddenly becomes a neat- obsessed nut in the second season, with no explanation, among others), and as with most shows that feature very young children, as the kids get older the dynamic changes. Michelle, as I stated earlier, was the youngest and often got away with way too much, even as she became more and more obnoxious at times. Her cuteness wore off by the time she was about 5, and when I compare the acting of the Olsen twins at the age to that of Jodie Sweetin in the show's early years, I can help but think that Sweetin was a much more natural actress. Stephanie often suffers from the middle child syndrome but I actually found her to be the funniest of the three Tanner daughters. I found it increasingly annoying that Michelle was very jealous of anyone who Jesse spent time with, including his own sons. It was also inevitable that the cuteness factor would shift to Nicki and Alex, and some fans may have found that difficult to adjust to.

John Stamos, of course, was the heartthrob of the series (and who can argue with that?), although Jesse's Elvis obsession occasionally was too much of a theme. Although for several years, Stamos tried to distance himself from the series in order to be taken seriously as an actor, ""Full House"" was a great showcase for his talent in both comedy and drama. Candace Cameron and Lori Loughlin, like Stamos, appeared in many television movies in the 1990s, and were always very capable no matter what the material. Both Bob Saget and Dave Coulier had their own shows on the side - Saget ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" and Coulier, ""America's Funniest People"". The rapport between the actors was obvious and was still apparent when Netflix premiered the spin-off, ""Fuller House"", in which Cameron, Sweetin and Barber reprised their roles and the rest of the cast (with the exception of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who no longer act professionally), made guest appearances. ""Fuller House"" received mixed reviews, and while the chemistry is still there, let's face it - television ain't what it used to be. ""Full House"" lives on in syndication, on DVD, and in the hearts of its fans.",1475712000,,5725,4.856704196519959

2915206,5,B000U1ZV4O,"I picked up this Set today from my local walmart.  I already owned the full series of full house, but I had purchased it while it was being sold as individual seasons.  this one box set was mainly to replace that because some of the discs had started developing physical wear and tear over time and would no longer play  So it was a much easier replacement.  A new box and all new discs.  I checked my box for missing discs and am happy to report everything is here.  I noticed many of the older 1 star reviews had that as a complaint.

As far as a TV series, it's a fun show with good family humor and, while it may not  be the most realistic family show, there are still good things to come away with.  It was written to be a family comedy, and for that I think it was well done.

I enjoy more of the older shows compared to current ones today.  I was born in the late 70's grew up in the 80's and 90's so While I may not watch the shows a lot now,  I consider them good collector's items.",1468454400,,991,3.9746192893401013

2915555,4,B000U1ZV4O,"I LOVED Full House when I was a kid. It was very rare that there was a good quality show that had main characters that were my age (I'm only a couple of years younger than Candace Cameron.) This, along with Family Matters and Boy Meets World, were the exceptions. Great lessons, acting that was cheesy but a lot of fun, and comfort. This has always been one of my big comfort shows.

With the new sequel show, Fuller House coming out in a few weeks, I wanted to see the old episodes....not that the show isn't on 20 times a day as it is, but being able to watch it whenever I want is really great.

This set came out a few years ago, in a box shaped like the house (though it had a pointed roof when the actual house has a flat roof. meh), but this is actually much better. The contents are the same, but this house is much better because it has a picture of the cast on the front.

The dvds are in clear, slim cases, two discs to a case. I haven't watched much of the episodes as of yet, but the few that I have watched are great quality for being filmed on video tape just about 30 years ago. I didn't see any artifacts or compression...that I noticed. Even the unaired pilot with a different actor in place of the well known Bob Saget is in just about perfect condition. It was really weird, but cool, to see the episode with a different actor in the part. The lines are the same, though a few of the shots have a slightly different angle. It's fun to watch, but doesn't have the same heart that the regular version of the episode does. Bob Saget just emotes better.

The only real downside of this set is that there aren't more special features. I understand that back when the show was made, there wasn't really that much of a home video market, and so there aren't usually vintage special features to go with the episodes. But I really wish they could have gotten the cast together to make some new commentaries or memory documentaries. I do know that the cast hangs out from time to time, so it should have been easy to do. Oh, well. Considering that the show is so amazing and the enjoyment you get from it, lacking commentaries is a minor grievance. If you are in any way a fan of the late 80s and early 90s, especially the tv programs, you should pick up this set. It's well worth the price.",1452643200,2,2301,4.199095022624435
2915556,5,B000U1ZV4O,"how can you not love full house!!!!!  this is a nice box set, although the discs were all backwards, but with that said its a lot of fun.  its such a flash back to my childhood, and i was ahppy to get it at a great price.  worth it for anyone who loves the 80's/90's sitcoms.  and if you are very careful with your children and what they watch, you are safe with this.",1452556800,,368,3.9324324324324325

2915564,5,B000U1ZV4O,When this box set dropped well bellow the asking retail price I had to pick this box set up. I am a hug huge  fan of the tanner family a.k.a Full House I seen all the episodes already 100s and 100s of times  but there's nothing like having the complete show all in one box.  If you already own all the sessions separately there's no reason to pick up this box set because you don't get anything special from owning the sessions individually you only get the convenience of having the whole series in one box. I would definitely pick this up if your a big fan ASAP because it's still going for well under the retail price but if your a huge fan of the show your probably already own it or will likely buy it at full retail price regardless if it goes back up. Some of you may not  know this but I'm pretty sure this is a re release of this box set because the original box set actually came in a really cool house box which sadly they don't make. If you wanna check that out go to youtube and watch some unboxings. If your like me and most of your friends and family make fun of you for watching still pick it up your not alone. The best part of owning this box set is that you don't have to keep watching the same episodes over and over on TV.  The Complete series has 192 episodes which is 8 sessions on 32 discs and 4 discs per season. When watching it on a HD TV it actually plays in full screen 16:9 compared to 4:9 which it was filmed. There really are no special features with this some very little commentary is nice. The reason there is not to much bonus features is because they wernt really planing on putting the show on VHS or DVD. I really think it's a nice little box set expecially on sell.,1451520000,,1705,4.092814371257485
2915565,4,B000U1ZV4O,"Bought this 7 months before Christmas as a Christmas present.  Upon inspection (Dec 30th), Season 2 Disk 2 has a manufacturering defect in it.

Originally, I gave it one star due to the fact that it would probably take more than 30 days to get through all 32 disks to find one that may be bad, but Amazon saved the day and was able to help me out of that situation.  Therefore, because of the quality of programming on the disks, and so far, only one has a defect (affecting 2 of the shows), I will only take off one star.  But, beware that all disks should be checked when buying to make sure there are no issues reading them.  The defect was visible to the naked eye.",1451433600,2,669,4.1953125

I guess I had forgotten about some of the issues they dealt with in those early episodes. Jessie has a lot of interesting girlfriends and says hell several times. I guess it just surprised me a bit because we were going to watch with our 8,6,4 and 2 year old. I just want to warn anyone with really little kids. We will still be watching them with our kids because it is such a great show and I am so happy to be able to share this with my kiddos.

2915657,4,B000U1ZV4O,"This item arrived 2 days before it was slated to (and just one day after I ordered it), so I was pleasantly surprised to see it on my doorstep yesterday. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to do a quick check to make sure I had all the DVDs from all the seasons, as several reviewers noted that they were missing some DVDs and/or had duplicates of others. My only real complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because all the seasons had a really nice color DVD, whereas seasons 2 and 8 were really plain and didn't match the rest of the set. It should also be noted that some of the negative reviews were from people who bought this collection and watched it for the first time, and just didn't like the show. So if you know you like the show and just wanted the series, don't be too put off by some of the 1 star ratings. I took a picture of the case next to a soda can for a frame of reference for the size of the collection, as well as a couple of the set itself.

The packaging seems really sturdy and can be used for display when the DVDs are not in use. I particularly enjoyed watching the unaired pilot with the different actor playing Danny. It was interesting to see how that actor interacted with the rest of the cast. He seemed more at ease with the script than Bob Saget was (both pilots were word for word, so I assumed it was written with the other guy in mind). I've only watched a couple episodes so far, as I've been busy. This collection would be great for a rainy or sick day marathon.",1428537600,2,645,4.295081967213115

All discs were in the package, they had them separated into seasons and by discs. Which was a great help.

Just to re-iterate what you perhaps already know - This box set comes in a pretty sturdy cardboard box with 16 individual slim DVD cases holding 2 discs each (32 discs in total). Each DVD case has a nice box art that summarizes the episodes in it. It also has a pretty looking disc art (except the later seasons, 7 and 8).

2915947,4,B000U1ZV4O,"I've been trying to find family friendly programming for my children, and this does a good job!  Their are a total of 32 discs, each with 4-6 episodes, and some bonus features.  All the discs come in plastic cases and are stored in a sturdy cardboard house.  It is really adorable.  I don't imagine the house would hold up forever with children handling it, but with an adult in control, it should hold up fine.

I only gave it a four star, because the first season is not so kid friendly.  Jesse (John Stamos) is a womanizer and uses the words h*ll and d*mn in nearly every episode.  While he dates a lot of woman, it never goes beyond kissing, although there are some references to spending the night, etc. throughout the series.

After the first season, there is less cursing, but you will here it on occasion.  The show starts to focus more on the children and less on the love lives of the three men.

All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.  I do think that young children should watch with a parent, but for the most part, it is so much better than anything you would find on tv today for families.",1397001600,,1115,4.3125

2916022,4,B000U1ZV4O,"Just received this product in the mail. I was super excited but upon opening it I am curious if I didn't get a used/fraudulent product. Everything was sealed in plastic wrap like it would come from the manufacturer BUT there were dirty finger prints on the box. Also when I looked through the Dvds I found two issues. A little under half of the disks have minor scratches or big smears on them, including finger prints. If this were truly a new item there shouldn't be any of those on the disks. I also noticed that about half of the disks don't have the cover art that would have came adhered to a factory made disk, which is why I worry about fraudulence...
Since it is new I am going to watch them all and make sure that they all work (i'll make a new review if not), but it just seems a bit fishy too me.",1393372800,,808,4.1528662420382165

Was every single episode just as good as the last? Obviously no. But most of these offered clever writing, funny jokes, and a good ending.

2916046,5,B000U1ZV4O,the price was just unbeatable at $60. the box was smaller then i thought it would be since the DVDs were place in slim hard cover DVD cases only.

2916063,5,B000U1ZV4O,"I Stumbled across this series by accident and as I used to watch this as a kid, I decided to go ahead with the purchase. Full house is a series that brings back so many memories. It is humorous, touching and brings out some valuable lessons and advise in a very entertaining way. It is so refreshing to have a series that all the family can enjoy without all the senseless violence and swearing that are in a lot of our series today.  I am really enjoying this series and I highly recommend it.",1390780800,,494,4.25531914893617
2916064,4,B000U1ZV4O,"I loved the wholesome family type of show this was...and honestly John Stamos was not hard to look at either. When I bought the series, it was because it was shown in an email just before Christmas at an awesome price. The packaging is a box that looks just like the picture. The roof comes off (so you could easily put it on a shelf), and the front opens to reveal the dvd's in the skinny cases.

It's a nice way to spend some time watching TV with kids and not have to worry about language or content that is inappropriate. Even watching the old episodes by myself is enjoyable. I am very impressed with the quality of the packaging. It's cardboard, but sturdy enough to last and looks cute.

When there is nothing worth watching on TV, it's nice to have an ""oldy"" to go back and watch. This would be great for someone who has kids, or contact with them, who are too young to have known the show. I'm sure that the kids would get a kick out of John's mullet hair style in the beginning of the series (though I can't help but wonder how he feels about it now. ;-)",1390780800,2,1064,4.185365853658537

Videos come in a cute ""full house"" shaped box. They come in order of Seasons. There are 2 videos per video case, each of which is very thin, half the thickness of a usual video case. This makes it easier to take a few with you as they fit much easier in my daughters carrying case along with her travel DVD player. I would recommend this set to anyone who has a full house fan in their house.",1390521600,,547,4.121495327102804

2916081,5,B000U1ZV4O,"My daughter is a big fan of this show so my son wanted to buy this set for her for Christmas. She is 7 and he is 10. In early Dec. this set was not as expensive as it is now.  I am so glad it wasn't so expensive then because the look on her face Christmas morning was priceless. She was so shocked and immediately gave her brother a hug. This show is just fun entertainment for the kids with only Jesse's smooching on many different girls (until he gets married) as the raciest scenes. Of course, when DJ gets older she starts smooching on different guys (try explaining that to a 7 yr old girl). But, other than that, it is a show you can go to the kitchen to start dinner and trust that your 7 and 10 yr old child aren't being exposed to explicit adult themes.

The box is just as pictured - the townhouse that is the show's setting. It is easy for her to handle and the dvds are in slim line cases inside the box.  Wish there were a brochure with some history of the show and bios of the cast to answer her many questions about the lives of the actors.  The case isn't unsightly in the family room.

2916085,5,B000U1ZV4O,There's an episode where John Stamos (uncle Jesse) rides his motorcycle off a building in his younger days and wants to attempt it again. A nail biter. I liked his mullet days but John just looked way better when he 90s upped his hair. As he bonds with his family who tend to fade into the background while John takes center stage he learns that his wild days are behind him and it's time to raise his twin sons. This saga of uncle Jesse is one that really tugs at the heart strings but can also lead to much anxiety and frustration when he takes the wrong route to fix his problems. When he went back to school and was struggling you struggle with him and want him to be that honest guy we know lies at his core by telling people how he feels. I won't give away spoilers but I believe it's in the sixth season. Knowing John you know that the good in him always wins out. Bob Saget makes for an interesting joke here and there. John Stamos has many girlfriends throughout the early seasons and will make you jealous of them. Five stars John. Couldn't ask for more.,1390089600,2,1064,4.246305418719212

However, this series was purchased for my 5 yr old who looooooooooooves the show and looooooooooooves when Michelle was little. She doesn't get half of what is going on in the shows but she loves the little girls and, on the whole, it is a good ""family"" show... kind of like the Brady Bunch from the 90's. The 3 kids get into some kind of trouble and then *poof* they ""come clean"" and all is forgiven. Nothing too horrible happens in any given episode, no nudity or swearing etc...  Hence the 5 stars because the actual owner of this product thinks it is the best and if she could type faster than one word a minute would no doubt be telling you all how hilarious the show is herself",1389484800,,817,4.237179487179487

So what made it great for grand mother and father was how happy she was to receive the gift.  :)  The only downer about it was being delivered by UPS to the wrong address.  However Amazon sent another one out right away.  In the meantime before UPS delivered the second package the lady several houses down the street where the package had been erroneously delivered showed up with the package just in time for the graduation party.  When UPS stopped two days later with the replacement package I refused delivery explaining what had happened.  We did not want Amazon to suffer the expense of the second gift.  I hope you received the refused delivery back to your warehouse ok.  We definitely will use Amazon again!  THANK YOU.  Bob Mack,1372464000,2,852,4.6891891891891895

It arrived safely and undamaged in the mail and had all the discs in it (supposedly a lot of people got duplicates or not all of the discs) but mine came complete. I was disappointed this didn't come out on Blu Ray (maybe it will eventually?) because it looks kinda of bad on an HD TV but I can deal with it.

When I seen that Amazon finally carried it, I was very pleased. I was a bit hesitant at first because of some of the reviews that had stated that they hadn't gotten the complete set and were missing some discs, but in the end I decided to go for it anyway knowing(from a past experience) that Amazon was great with their customer service and would gladly help me if I were to have a problem. I am so glad I decided to buy this. I received all the correct discs, not one was missing or duplicated which I was very thankful for and as another reviewer stated the little house was shipped safely with no damage, everything was perfect.

I don't know how something like this could happen but you would think it would be kind of hard to miss as they were putting the set together. I know amazon.com has nothing to do with the putting together of this set so it's not them i'm blaming.

Since she got this collection for Christmas, we've had non-stop Full House.  The programs are wonderful, they teach good lessons for both kids and parents on how to handle situations.  The unique family situation is still so relevant as many households currently have blended and/or untypical living arrangements.  I'd forgotten how many special guests they had, and am enjoying the series too.  And the bonus, there is now time left on our DVR for me!",1294185600,,556,4.810526315789474

They have it still on tv all the time, and now that I have the series myself I have noticed that they do tend to put them on in order which is nice, although they repeat them too much.  But it's wonderful having it myself.  When I got it I watched it from beginning to end in the matter of a couple weeks or so.  It was wonderful!  I had forgotten why Jesse had cut his hair or why DJ and Steve broke up.  I also watched Aladdin not long ago and figured out that Aladdin was Steve's voice! :D  I got this on sale through a gold box deal, and it was definitely worth it.

2916270,5,B000U1ZV4O,"Full House has always been a part of my life.  I'm young enough that it was mostly reruns I watched growing up, but even in a dis-connected pick-and-choose television timeline, the Tanner family was always a joy to watch.  In every cheesy, sugar coated episode there was a lesson to be learned, a moment shared, some laughter, and above all - a memory.

It wasn't until I started watching this box set did I realize just how wonderful the show really was, however.  When you start at the beginning and make your way through the seasons, you have the ability to watch life go by.  You watch three adorable girls become three adorable, but challenged women.  You see young men make and break careers, relationships, succeed and fail at parenting.  And in a scary way, it's almost as if it's happening in real time.  ""Look how fast Michelle has grown!"" I hear myself say, or ""DJ's wearing MAKEUP? It seems like just yesterday..""

It doesn't matter what kind of family you have, because even if you aren't close with your own, you instantly become close with the Tanners and watching them grow and learn new things, you can't help but reflect on your own life and think - am I letting these small memories go too easily?  Shouldn't I cherish every moment of life because I know (like the unfortunate season 8) it's all going to come to an end someday?

I am a very picky person about watching television, I could name only a handful of shows that would be able to keep my attention for a season, much less 8.  Full House is probably my 2nd favorite of them all (Just behind I Love Lucy) because there is so much character growth and importance of each episode that missing a single one would be like missing a daughter's wedding.  Some episodes are ""better"" than others, of course, but that's true of all memories and strengthens the quality of the show.  There's not always a pole through Danny's wall, there's not always a near eloping, and that's what makes it special.  Sometimes it's just the first day of school, sometimes it's peer pressure.  Little things that families so often forget as important moments become highlighted in Full House.  It may make me sound like a lonely house wife, but many times (more than I care to admit) have I had a tear brimming in my eyes while watching these episodes.  As the girls grow up it only gets worse... I don't know if I'm strong enough to have children of my own.",1280188800,,2410,4.5265588914549655
2916271,5,B000U1ZV4O,This was a christmas present for my kids.  They are huge fans of the eighties TV show.  They continue to watch it over and over again.,1265414400,,134,4.115384615384615
2916272,5,B000U1ZV4O,"My 7 year old daughter can't get enough of it!  She's on her second time around watching 160+ episodes.  I can hear her laughing from the other side of the house.  It teaches kids good values about life in a real fun way.  I wasn't a fan of the show growing up, but now I realize what a fantastic TV show it really was and how talented those actors were.  My husband has even admitted he enjoys watching it too!",1264982400,,411,4.0875

I have to say when I was growing up I would watch the show and I could relate with some of the stuff that was on the show. I really enjoy watching the show even now when I'm older. Even though it was on for 8 years the show is still viewing every day across American.,1261958400,,450,3.649484536082474

2916277,1,B000U1ZV4O,"I remember periodically watching this show when younger and thinking it was ridiculous in the simplicity of the problems the family faced.  The characters oozed enough sugar that I'm sure long-term fans suffer from diabetes.  And yet, there was litle else on television of value.

Flipping through the channels the other day, I just so happened to catch bits of a rerun episode and was about to show my little kids until I discovered the subplot about DJ's friend, Kimmy - more annoying than Jar Jar Binks - and her non-stop makeout sessions with her boyfriend.  Forget family friendly, this show is disgusting and stupid.

You'd be better off teaching your kids life lessons through a good book.",1252368000,12,696,4.864406779661017

They always play the same few episodes on cable, so I never got to see my ""favorites"". Now, I watch them all in order, whenever I feel like going back in time. I love that I can find my faves, with no more waiting! And, I was a senior when the show ended, so I was always busy and never got to see the last episode! What a great item to buy!

But I must say, I still love watching the Tanners! I am enjoying each episode and I have not regret at all that I purchased the series.
Each and every character is great and brings back memories. And to see now the whole series is just great.

It has every single full house episode in a cute little collectible box. The only thing I wish is that there were more extras that came with the complete series. So sit back, relax, and enjoy hours of Full House entertainment with Danny, Jesse, Joey, Becky, DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle.

If you already have all of the seasons of this show then I don't recommend you getting the box set because there really isn't anything special about it besides the packaging BUT if you love the show and haven't kept up with collecting the seasons then make a wise purchase and buy the complete box set.",1233100800,8,767,4.478571428571429

Full House is a great family show.  I love their format of incorporating some valuable life lessons into each episode.

2916292,5,B000U1ZV4O,I was a fan of full house when growing up but didn't really remember much of it. Being in New Zealand meant that they basically didn't do re runs of it and the dvds are taking forever to get here so I got the complete series and  I LOVE IT! Totally worth the investment. Have already watched three seasons and its a trip down memory land. The fact it also came in the house made it just a little bit more appealing.,1209168000,2,415,4.060975609756097

2916297,5,B000U1ZV4O,"I love ""Full House"" so when I saw this complete series collection I asked for it and received it as a birthday gift.  I didn't own any of the season sets so this was a good buy, as it saved about 50 bucks from buying all of the seasons separately.  If you own most of the seasons already, don't purchase this (unless you think the box design is really cool, like me); it just packages all of the seasons together.  There are no extras; no extra features disc or booklet.  I recommend just purchasing the rest of the seasons separately if you already own more than half of them.  As for the features, this does contain the unaired pilot, a few trivia episodes, a couple of special featurettes, and  commentary on a few episodes from executive producer/writer/creator Jeff Franklin.  It also has an episode guide and interactive menus so you can easily access what you want to watch.  For those who complain about the lack of special features, this show was in production from 1987 to 1995.  They were not planning on releasing the series on VHS, let alone DVD.  Shows in production now are planning on DVD releases so they specifically create features for this purpose while filming episodes.  Just enjoy the features that are included, and if you really want to know behind the scenes tidbits look up the show on wikipedia.  If you want bloopers, just find them on youtube.  And if you love ""Full House"" purchase this collection.  You won't be disappointed!",1202860800,65,1457,4.640625

only the first 5 seasons includes spanish subtitles

EL PAQUETE ACABA DE LLEGAR! es una hermosa cajita (por su altura no cabe en mi estante para dvds!) la calidad es excelente, el menu entretenido, los episodios comodamente divididos por capitulos,
el unico ""PERO"" es que:

Solamente las primeras 5 temporadas estan SUBTITULADAS AL ESPAOL

la temporada 6 no incorpora subtitulo alguno (solo [CC] en ingles)
la temporada 7 incorpora solo subtitulos en INGLES
la temporada 8 incorpora solo subtitulos en INGLES

Espero que esto les ayude a la hora de determinar la compra.

When I saw the entire series in one collection, I decided that it would be a great gift. They were so happy and surprised. I decided to give it to them during a three day weekend,and I can see it is going to be 3 days of Tanner-laced fun. It seems so corny, but the sound of the theme song gives me this warm feeling.
