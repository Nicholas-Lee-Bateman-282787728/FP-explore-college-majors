8299945,4,B001EYV2YE,"I liked the quality but the film was very short, but well, its not like I didn't know about it, it said 43 mins lenght. Still as a mexican, I feel there are a lot of things missing, it is ok anyways and good for people who don't know a thing about the country and want to see some aspects of it.",1354406400,,295,3.774193548387097
8299946,5,B001EYV2YE,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this documentary on Mexico. I'm a 7th grade Geography teacher, and I showed it to my classes. They thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Not only does it highlight parts of Mexico's past, present, and future, but it also allows the viewer to get to know the people of Mexico. A Mexican wrestler, Acapulco cliff diver, chef, and woman celebrating the Day of the Dead are all featured in this work. It portrays Mexico in a positive light, and I really think it helped my students get over some of the negative stereotypes they had about our neighbors to the south. The footage of Mexico was spectacular, the stories were interesting, and I also liked the narration of Edward James Olmos. In my opinion, this documentary is definitely worth watching.",1322697600,,770,4.796992481203008

It doesn't just just feature places, but also the people of Mexico, both groups and individuals.  Well-worth watching.  :)",1251244800,2,280,5.925
8299948,1,B001EYV2YE,"This product is really disappointing, not to mention over priced!  It is basically like a very cheap promotional video of the sort you might expect to get for free at at a travel expo.  Very glossy, smooth American voiceover.  Just bad.  Don't bother.",1236643200,2,251,4.767441860465116
