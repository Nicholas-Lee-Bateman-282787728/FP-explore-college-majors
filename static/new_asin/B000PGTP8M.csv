2818981,5,B000PGTP8M,"Boo men is my favorite, vampire segment a close second and skeleton keys may actually scare even the most couragous horror film viewers. Using familar themes along with modern elements (awesome soundtrack, young teenagers (presumably the ones that end ""dead""), the director has created an overall awesome anthology that has stories that rival Creepshow. Definately reccomend this film for any horror movies fans that love being entertained and can look past the shot on video appearance.",1181433600,7,487,5.421052631578948

8191267,1,B000PGTP8M,"I was expecting way more than what I got.
When the first segment was done I was dumb founded.  Then when the whole movie was finished I still was.  There was nothing scary in this movie and the acting was bottom of the barrel.
Would not recommend to anyone to buy don't waste your money.
As for the other people that gave it rave reviews I don't think you have ever seen a real horror movie.",1396396800,,391,4.131578947368421
8191268,1,B000PGTP8M,"A bunch of bad actors got together to make 4 short want to be horror story's involving teens.

Clip #1. Face your fears; was a snore feast about 15 min's long about a teen menaced by a hooded figure that killed his abusive father, only to come to terms with the truth.

Clip #2. Werewolf; Ex-Girlfriend wants to resolve issue with ex-boyfriend, who confesses to her that he is a monster; she understands more than he knows.

Clip # 3. Skeleton keys; Teen girl has to prepare dead Grandmothers house for sale, finds some hand written music and plays the tune on piano for boyfriend in the house which calls forth the spirit of her hatch welding grandma.

Clip #4. Suckers; Teens have to clean their movie theater and discover a storage space with long box's and a film reel. (Hey lets watch it) Film is of a girl setting in a chair staring at the camera. Girl stalks main character and he decides she's a vampire, (Big surprise).

Final; Returns back to the guy in the library reading the notebook leaving him as the final story yet un-written.

This is another talentless attempt at conning us into spending money on a home movie.",1360368000,,1130,4.514705882352941
8191269,2,B000PGTP8M,"I would like to encourage the work of the horror-loving film student who made Dead Teenagers, but unfortunately this film written, directed, and produced by Chris LaMartina just isn't very good.  Not surprisingly, the film suffers greatly from the almost complete lack of a budget: it's shot on video with minimal sets, it features a lot of actors who really have no place in front of a camera, and it could use a lot more editing.  Trying to put all of the film's many problems aside, though, I'm starting to think that the vision of the script could have worked under better budgetary conditions and with a much more experienced filmmaker.  Unfortunately, that sort of what-if potential doesn't make Dead Teenagers any easier to watch.

We start with an anonymous college student (clad in a coat and tie for no apparent reason) perusing the bookshelves at the library.  A certain book sort of demands his attention, and he opens it up to find a composition book full of handwritten words and illustrations.  Curious about this book that all but threw itself at him, he decides to sit down and read the set of stories it contains.  Cue the horror vignettes.  We start with Boo Men, which is built around a decent albeit hackneyed idea but suffers greatly from an almost complete absence of dialogue and some pacing inconsistencies.  Next up is Full Moonlighting, a werewolf story with a twist that is pretty much done in by some really amateur acting.  Then comes Skeleton Key, which I find to be the best of the film's four stories.  A young woman goes to her dead grandmother's home to look over the remaining possessions before everything is sold.  When her boyfriend shows up later in the day, he tries to talk her into spending the night there, despite her reluctance to stay in the house where her aunt was viciously murdered forty years earlier.  Finally, there's a decent little vampire story that, like Full Moonlighting, suffers greatly from the quality of the acting (several bad lines of dialogue don't help much, either). At this point, we're taken back to our curious library reader for the ultimate and oh so predictable ending of the film.

It seems pretty obvious that Chris LaMartina had to scrounge around whatever and whoever he could find in order to make this movie.  I can certainly appreciate and applaud the college filmmaker's zeal and enthusiasm for trying to stake his own small claim in the horror genre, but Dead Teenagers is far too amateurish to entertain or please any horror fan.  Perhaps LaMartina will go on to make a decent horror film some day, but Dead Teenagers is clearly not that film.",1287878400,2,2628,4.768211920529802
8191270,4,B000PGTP8M,"Director Chris lamartina for those who don't know, is busy making another film, witch's brew, His latest slasher presidents day is currently touring festivals, and His latest dvd release Book of lore Is better then This film Dead teeagers Lamartinas first , what im getting at is this guy is not going anywhere so horror fans should get use to it and pay attention, lamartina knows what hes doing , i reccomend this film especialy at the price you can get it on here.

8191271,1,B000PGTP8M,"In the tradition of ""Creepshow"" and ""Tales from the Darkside""?? I Don't think so...

If you want to see how it's really done, rent TRICK R TREAT (2009), THREE...EXTREMES (2004)  or

8191272,5,B000PGTP8M,I was lucky enough to catch the premiere screening of this shot-on-video horror anthology and I can't wait to watch it on dvd. A must for any d.i.y. low budget horror movie connoisseur.,1224720000,,185,4.636363636363637
8191273,5,B000PGTP8M,"If you're expecting a big budget studio horror flick (and it looks like the other reviewers are), then, youll be disappointed. But if you like shot-on-video horror movies and campy anthology flicks (like the old Amicus or Tales from the Darkside shows), youll have fun with this Baltimore-made no budget flick. Not to mention the soundtrack is great and the stories are inventive. How often do you get a film with vampires, werewolves, and ghosts? Its a fun little movie and if you're expecting something else, go whine about the latest version of ""8 1/2"" on your blog.",1206144000,3,569,4.816326530612245
8191274,1,B000PGTP8M,This film is not really a film at all. It is a piece of garbage. Don't waste your time. I love watching good horror/slasher films. The director apparently has never seen one.,1205280000,,174,4.46875
