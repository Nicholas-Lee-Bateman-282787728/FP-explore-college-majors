6597828,1,B00MP2FG5A,"The film had a number of subplots and the initial restroom sex scene didn't seem to connect to anything else. There is a woods where people have been going missing for years with a serial killer. The detective hunting for him has English as a second language. Luke and Sarah have marriage problems and take Sarah's whining sister camping with them to said woods.

I was hoping Hanna, the whining sister, would die early and a horrible death, but such was not the case. We didn't get to know much about any of the characters. The acting and dialogue was bad and the soundtrack didn't work.

Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, nudity?",1451001600,,623,4.603603603603603
6597829,1,B00MP2FG5A,"Just the worst movie and I am dead serious about that, the fat girl was funny however, she did not like fresh fried fish, yet she would chase a candy bar like a lab rat with a piece of cheese all over the woods. Do not rent and if you have prime as i did, save yourself the time and by pass this POS.",1450656000,,300,3.703125
6597830,1,B00MP2FG5A,"After the early seen where the guy in the tent, runs out in broad daylight,  with his flashlight,  waving it all round..as if it were dark, I knew it was going to get worse...

DONT BE FOOLED ... a good description, even the cover ...its completely misleading and this movie is horrid.  I am a fan of B movies,  kinda low budget,  but still,  a good B movie can be great!
This is NOT even close,  the actors are Mediocre at best  !!!  The camera work is reminiscent of the early 80s....
 But even the 80s had great films,  this falls into its OWN class,  of just BAD !
A movie you will want that time in your life you lost...returned.
I hope I save you lovely people of Amazon movies some time.  RUN don't walk....",1450396800,,714,4.154411764705882

6597832,1,B00MP2FG5A,"I'm just going to start off by saying... I've never posted a review. I'm not by any means a film critic. This movie is absolutely lacking. If you're here for gore forget it, if you're here for actors... a big no. If you're here for a story... also no...stay away unless you're just looking to fill you quota of terrible movies, this is one.",1449705600,,340,4.328125

6597834,1,B00MP2FG5A,"This film was a major piece of s***! What a waste of money. In no way was this film like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or anything like that. Very bad acting, extremely bad camera lighting and camera handling. This movie was so bad I realized I fell asleep not even halfway through. Everyone do yourself a favor and watch trailers of movies like this before you buy it. Can't believe how bad it was..whoever made this film seriously needs to go back to directing/film producing school because it was bloody bad. Might as well sell this and hope someone likes Z films.",1427760000,8,565,4.549019607843137
6597835,5,B00MP2FG5A,"Quite Scary!! Scared me!! Slow start but keep with it. Some beautiful scenery of forests and lakes. A good Horror movie!! Not for children!!
Very suspenseful. A family of three, Husband, Wife, Sister, that all hate each other go on a camping trip in the forest. A mean killer lurks in the forest killing all strangers. Police have not caught him in 40 years! Excellent scary movie! Buy it.",1427760000,,389,4.6521739130434785

8673638,5,B00MP2FG5A,"A great supporting cast.  A great writer and director.  The vision of having someone watching you goes beyond the necessary bounds and make it all happen.  There are some amazing scenes with Matthew, Glenn, and Krista that makes the movie.  Its all about the way how family stands in unison in a dark hour.
