2069411,4,B000294U6E,"Even if the concert movie ""Wattstax"" had nothing else interesting in it, it would still be totally worth watching for the amazing sequence in which rhythm-and-blues legend Rufus Thomas (a bald, portly, middle-aged man who performs in a long-sleeved pink shirt tucked into red shorts over knee-high go-go boots) encourages the ecstatic crowd to spill out of the stands, onto the football field at the L.A. Coliseum, so they can do the Funky Chicken. They comply. At the end of the song, he tells the huge assortment of several hundred dancing fans that they have to return to their seats and, miraculously, again they comply. But when one odd, umbrella-twirling spectator is reluctant to leave the field, Thomas heckles and teases him then, fed up, asks the crowd to remove him. And, man, they comply; the umbrella man is gone within about 3.6 seconds.

Concerts like that just don't happen anymore and Wattstax, a 1972 festival held to mark the seventh anniversary of the Watts race riots, is a lot more than just a presentation of incredible music (by Thomas, the Staples Singers, the Bar-Kays, Albert King and Isaac Hayes). Director Mel Stuart (who, notably, also made ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"") filmed the entire concert but then decided to intercut footage of church services in the Watts area, man-on-the-street interviews about race (Ted Lange, who later went on to play Isaac on ""The Love Boat,"" angrily weighs in) and very off-the-cuff comedy by Richard Pryor.

The pieces don't always mesh together - and I really wish Stuart hadn't felt compelled to interupt the sets by Albert King and others -  but they're all fascinating in their own way and the music is tremendously good.",1096156800,38,1701,4.940559440559441
2069412,5,B000294U6E,"I was seven years old in the summer of 1972 and visiting with relatives in Harlem. While Wattstax was filmed on the opposite coast that same summer, I can tell you that it was a good time capsule of the sights, sounds, and attitudes of that era.

The Richard Pryor monologues were not as spontaneous as they appear. These were actually routines from his then-forthcoming (and Grammy-winning) album ""That N(egro)'s Crazy."" However, they truly fit in the context of things.

Ted Lange and ""Woodrow"" from Sanford and Son hold forth on Black life as do other everyday folk on the streets of Watts. While some whites have complained about the negativity of some of their statements, it is important to recall that this was four years after MLK'assassination and eight years after the Civil Rights act, so a lot of hostility was still in the air.

The highlights, such as the Emotions singing ""Peace Be Still"" at the sanctified church and Rufus Thomas' (RIP) interaction with the crowd have been discussed, but I also like where the young Jesse  Jackson, in introducing Issac Hayes says, ""I'm a preacher so I can't say it, but y'all know Issac Hayes is a BAD....."" He holds the mike to the audience as they gleefully shout the rest.

Overall, this film is an excellent time capsule of like in Black America, 1972.",1094860800,14,1307,4.714912280701754

2069414,5,B000294U6E,"I have waited years to see this.  I know that there have been bootlegs of this film floating around for years, but I never seen it.  I'm glad I've waited for a proper release as this has the true ending with Issac Hayes doing Shaft.

A truly amazing movie, which captures the essence of the culture, and gives you the insight of how things were during those times in the early 70's.  So much emotion in it that, you feel like you are taking part of the event yourself.

I love the footage they had with people talking. I saw a couple of people that would go on to have a acting career in the film. I saw Issac from the Loveboat up on there and Ned the Whino( I forgot his real name ). I guess this is what got their acting career started.

The skits with Richard Pryor were comedy classics.  So many people copied his style over the years.

I was amazed when Rufus Thomas got all those people to go back to their seats after they all came onto the field during his performance. It was one guy that didn't go back to his seat and Rufus was just clowning him and had everyone laughing at him.  Priceless.

There had to been 100,000 people that attended that show and not one fight. If this were to happen today you would have had body bags galore out there.  There is no respect in music now.

It's sad to think that Stax as record company would be no more just a few years later.  Watching this movie, you couldn't even see that as a possibility.  Probably the last great moment in soul music.

Just a classic film that I recommend to anybody that appreciates real soul music and its history.",1094601600,22,1591,4.2218543046357615
2069415,5,B000294U6E,"I feel as though the current editorial review perhaps does a slight disservice  surrounding the fact that the film does not exclusively feature the concert footage. When Mel Stuart originally looked at the footage from the show he has said that he felt as though the concert needed a context. It needed to be appreciated as being informed by (but not a mere reflection) of a distinct cultural experience. If he hadn't, we would be left with just the art and not the inspiration. Exploring these things together in his film makes for a rather interesting and fun time. So then, rather than offer a standard and totalizing explanation, he opted for interviews and episodic footage which includes among other things: churches, broken hearts, pimps, Love Boat bartenders, streetcorner philosophers, and Richard Pryor. The effect is the sense that blackness isn't a neat package. You see, while the film is a nice document of black power peaking, there are a lot of different definitions of blackness that are featured as much as there are the different kinds of music performed at the show.  I would also note that the DVD includes the original footage of Isaac Hayes' performance (which due to issues w/ MGM) was cut before the film's release. Overall its an incredibly nice film. There's a lot of good music and the film definitely has a lot more to offer beyond being tagged unfortunately as the Black Woodstock. It's STAX records. Come on. Rufus' shorts, the Bar-Kays? hair, Johnnie Taylor and the pimps parade, the woman in the red dress, the innumerable samples Public Enemy got from this film...Try it.",1090540800,36,1605,4.897058823529412

However, STAX records is hardly ever mentioned, much less remembered. I first saw the movie, WATTSTAX, in 1972. It was one of those movies, that one goes to see, that turns out, to be, better than one thought it would be. The fact, that WATTSTAX, will be on DVD, is long overdue. It is so wrong, to compare WATTSTAX to WOODSTOCK, because it's like comparing AMERICAN IDOL to STAR SEARCH...two entirely different shows. Just like WATTSTAX and WOODSTOCK, are two entirely different movies. Even though the Richard Pryor performances will steal the movie, the soul music is the heart, of the movie. The only thing, that is wrong, with WATTSTAX, is that...there isn't enough, of that beautiful, delicious, southern fried soul music.",1085443200,8,896,5.361702127659575
2069417,5,B000294U6E,"The Wattstax concert took place in 1973-- 8 years after the Watts Riots. It was a benefit funded by Watts Records to ""help the people of Watts, and give our artists exposure in Los Angeles,"" (quoted Al Bell, then president of Stax Records). Proceeds went to the Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, the Martin Luther King Hospital and the Watts Summer Festival.
This movie is a must-see. Aside from the [great] music, there are interviews with working-class black Angelenos which give you a look at the political and social climate at that point in time. Jessie Jackson's opening speech is inspirational. Richard Pryor's ongoing commentary is pure genius.
Isaac Hayes and Rufus Thomas' performances are big highlights as well as the sweet, soulful outpouring performed by the Emotions in a small chapel in Watts.

I just watched this and I see so many familiar faces of actors before they made it on television shows like Isaac from the Love Boat, Woodrow from Sanford and Son and many others. This was filmed when I was probably 4 years old so I can still relate a bit. This looked like a soul version of Woodstock. I think what most amazed me about the interviews conducted throughout this documentary were the stories blacks dealt with then is no different than what's going on today. And this was filmed in 1973.

By it's very nature, it is a political statement vis-a-vis the racial tension of Watts (as the title suggests), but, on a happier note, displays such delightful music that it is more of a celebration of black music than grieving over the politics of Watts in the 60's.

It's a magnificent tribute to the music and the community of that time and place; its purity makes you wonder what happened to the MUSIC; it's a joy to be transported back to the powerhouse that it was.

2069442,5,B000294U6E,"Wattstax is a documentary film released in 1973 on the concert that was staged at the L.A. Coliseum in 1972 to commemorate the 6th anniversary of the 1966 Watts riots. The concert featured acts from the Stax label.

This film jumps all over the place with random scenes of black neighborhoods in Los Angeles, various folks talking about all kinds of issues for black people, Richard Pryor working his comedic magic, and of course scenes of the concert.

What I enjoyed most overall is the visual style and vibe of this film. The clothes and style of speaking(along with the music) is so emblematic of the early 70's. A few of the brothers had that ""jive turkey"" way of speaking. And Ted Lange from the Love Boat had quite a few speaking scenes.

There are plenty of special features including 2 commentary tracks(first one is with Chuck D. from Public Enemy and author Rob Bowman; second track includes a whole host of folks including director Mel Stuart and Isaac Hayes himself). There's a 1973 theatrical trailer and a 2003 DVD trailer.

Performance by Isaac Hayes of ""Rolling Down a Mountain""(3:56) and an uncut performance of Albert King(3:28). And lastly there's an interview segment called ""Vocal Direct from the Soul"" with Chuck D. and Rob Bowman(4:52).

Keep in mind that there is strong language and social themes in this film that reflects the situations that these folks were in(and this film is obviously meant for a mature adult audience).",1358121600,,1452,4.838709677419355

2069448,2,B000294U6E,"I thought that this would be a concert film with lots of exceptional music. But it's as much social commentary, if not more, than it is a concert film. I found out about the concert by listening to an interview with Rance Allen and had hoped to hear him - he was not included. But instead there was a loong piece of three women singing in their church. Some musicians were not introduced and were shown performing part of a song outside of the concert setting, so you have to guess who the artist is.

There was a lot of conversation by men that contained the ""n"" word and supposedly this shows us the different ways the word is used. But none of that supposed instruction was clear at all, so it just seemed like the men used this word with impunity the women didn't. Some of the sexist attitudes expressed are disturbing to hear. I don't know why they belong in this film.

There was so little music and so many acts had their songs cut short that the concert itself almost seemed like it was incidental to the interviews that were included. Many of those interviews focused on men talking to each other about racism and women with a few women talking about men. As social history, it's cliched and superficial.

Probably Richard Pryor's act was heard more than anything else and that footage was not part of the concert. I'd say this was a strangely incomplete representation of the concert. I guess I'll have to buy cd's to get a better impression of the music. Basically this was somewhat interesting as a superficial introduction to the concert itself, but really failed to deliver the music. I almost wonder why it was assembled at all. Maybe as a small amount of period background to give us a flashback to 1972 when the concert happened.

The black power and civil rights movements had resulted in a certain educational pursuit that resulted in a great deal of intellectual and emotional uplift and knowledge along with a very heavy dose of both afrocentric fasion senses and gospel ferver. It was all part of what I call the 70's funk era and there would be few better ways to project that than seeing the southern funk/soul talents of 70's Stax/Volt do their stuff at this magnificant music festival. The performances are all kicking,particurly by seeing the vibrant,celebratory Bar-Kays performing ""Son Of Shaft"" followed,by the end by Ike Hayes-Black Moses himself performing his original hit ""Theme From Shaft"",the studio version of which was backed up by the Bar Kays. You also see Rufus Thomas performing ""Funky Chicken"" in pink shorts (move over AC/DC) and engaging in some strong and very witty report with a very hammish audience member. The Staple Singers,Luther Ingram,William Bell and even Kim Weston also deliver some classic performances here. But there's more here than that. Much in the same spirit as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woodstock/dp/B001NXDSLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woodstock</a>&nbsp;this is presented as a documentary film with Richard Pryor engaging in some very off the cuff (even for him) comedic observations on the black community of the day. We also talk to different people:men,woman (some of whom are observably well known actors) in the community who discuss everything around them from their persective. Womans lib,hair,civl rights and religion all get baught into the affair. We even take a break from the big music acts here to visit with a gospel group singing beautifully in a store front church. The overall effect is that your actually an active participant in the events rather than just watching a concert. Everyone who actually attended actually had (and shared) that same experience so when this was put together is was vital that the happily communal atmosphere of the event,essential to the very spirit of the funk era I mentioned be maintained as much as possible. It will make you tremble with happiness and empowerment to hear Jesse Jackson tell a watching and waiting audience ""I MAY BE ON WELFARE BUT I AM SOMEBODY!"". That one statement in particular had a huge impact on me and there's a lot of that sort of thing here. And much to my delight in particular it is. So anyone thinking this is merely a good performance with no other verbal commentary on the culture from which it came would be advised to check this out and enjoy the total experience.",1270944000,,2766,5.190156599552573

Chappelle apparently based his movie on Wattstax and I figured it would be worth checking out. I came out of the theatre absolutely amazed that I had never even so much as heard about it before.

This film is best described a documentary with some great music footage. It's a not a music film. Those who see it expecting mostly music footage may be disappointed. However, director Mel Stuart skillfully weaves interviews with locals from Watts and some comic relief from Richard Pryor throughout the concert footage to make for a riveting film.

Highlights are The Emotions' spectacular take on 'Peace, Be Still', Rufus Thomas' 'Breakdown/Funky Chicken', Luther Ingrams' 'If Loving You Is Wrong' and Pryor's take on African Americans in the U.S.

2069465,5,B000294U6E,"Wattstax is a concert film, based on the performance of the same name which was held in the summer of 1972.  Held in the Los Angeles Coliseum, the concert was the climax of what was then an annual week-long festival held in the African-American community of Watts commemorating the rebellion/riots that took place in 1965.  All of the music performers involved were from the now-storied Stax label, which gave the American pop landscape such acts as Sam & Dave, Booker T. & the MGs, and the Otis Redding.  A diverse selection of performers gives viewers a near-complete glimpse of the black music experience circa 1972:  Gospel, blues, R&B, and funk artists all on the same bill.  Promoted as ""The black Woodstock"", the full concert was six hours, here condensed to roughly 90 minutes.

The concert was hosted by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who speaks his now-legendary ""I Am Somebody"" sermon.  Highlights of the show include the Staple Singers (""Respect Yourself""), The Bar-Kays (""Son of Shaft""), Johnnie Taylor (""Jody's Got Your Girl and Gone"") Albert King (""I'll Play the Blues for You""), and Rufus Thomas (""The Funky Chicken"").  ""Shaft"" composer and future ""South Park"" icon Isaac Hayes got to close the show, and the DVD restores most of his performance (Warner Bros. Pictures controlled the copyright to the ""Shaft"" movie songs and refused clearance for the film, which was originally released through Columbia Pictures; the original movie footage of Hayes was rather brief, which perhaps damaged its box office run).

Interspersed between the concert footage are man-on-the-street interviews with assorted locals, who get to opine without censorship on various issues of the day.  A pre-""Love Boat"" Ted Lange is among them (his prematurely graying mustache lending unintentional humor to his young-guy rants).  Also bookending many segments is Richard Pryor, whose similarly uncensored dialogue make some affecting points about uncomfortable subjects, from slavery to police brutality to unemployment.  That he manages to find humor in the brutality of racism speaks to the genius of the late comic.

Wattstax, released in the midst of the ""blaxploitation"" movie trend, was a then-unheard of snapshot of the state of black America as buffered through the music of its artists.  There are many establishing shots of storefronts in black neighborhoods:  ramshackle churches abound, as well as other starkly blighted structures. As one resident puts it, ""some things have changed for the better... some for the worst... a lot of things have stayed the same..""  Whatever the physical costs of the civil rights movement (there is brief footage included of Dr. Martin Luther King's final speech) the emotional wounds were still fresh.  ""Black is beautiful"" was the catchphrase of the day, and Afrocentric styles of hair and fashion were at a pre-disco peak (however the flamboyant `players' who come to see a nightclub show anticipate the ""me decade"" excess that was to come).  Based on footage shown, the assembly team who put together the stage in the middle of the field is mostly white; however, according to commentator Rob Bowman, Stax boss Al Bell insisted that the private security be black as well as any LAPD involved.

2069480,4,B000294U6E,"I've finally got the chance to see this cool film on what was called the ""Black Woodstock"".  In 1965, the Los Angeles neighborhood called Watts went up in flames during a riot that lasted almost a week with dozens of people killed.  7 years after the tragic event, the community got together at the Los Angeles Coliseum for an all day music festival.  Put together by Stax Records, many of the artists would perform to a huge audience.  The film is about the event itself and the director interviews many of the residents and performers about the experience and the recovery of the area.  The film as a whole is a moving experience and the music is outstanding, but the real star of the film is a young Richard Pryor.  His comedy routine would be recorded more in detail two years later in the breakthrough album, ""That N*gg*r's Crazy"".  On the flipside, this movie reminded me of being in a time warp.  Those who are 35 and under will not understand the significance of the movie.  And it's just as well.  Everything that the movie was supposed to promote didn't happen (i.e. 1991 South Central Riots).

For a music fan, it can be frustrating - while the comments of the residents of Watts (including a pre-Love Boat Ted Lange) are interesting at first, they tend to bore after a while.  Furthermore, the interstitials of Richard Pryor do nothing to enhance his reputation as a comic genius.
Some of the performances are good - the Staples Singers smoke through a version of ""Respect Yourself"", and Albert King is great, and the Bar-Kays are funk personified, but the schlocky ""If Loving You Is Wrong"" and ""The Funky Chicken"" are pretty poor choices from the Stax archives.  Also, the grand finale shows Isaac Hayes to be a fairly average performer.
