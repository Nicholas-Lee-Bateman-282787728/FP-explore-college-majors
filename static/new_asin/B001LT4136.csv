8319719,5,B001LT4136,"Jim (Tony Brownrigg) fancies himself a script writer with style and integrity. His agent (Joshua Morris) demands he write horror, a genre Jim looks upon with disdain. He enlists the assistance of his low-brow friend Carl (Edward Landers) a horror film aficionado. Then Victoria (Arianne Martin) appears in Jim's life. Victoria is Jim's un-dead muse. Jim struggles to get rid of her and to write his screen play and tries to keep people around himself alive as Victoria is prone to do things to inspire Jim...like kill people.

The film is first and foremost a comedy. I love comedy-horror films and this one is no exception. I thought the film was very good, but seemed terribly miscast. It was border line cult classic.

Now my beef was with Carl who said horror films are not ""art"" and forget any meaning. That is hardly true. Zombies represent the mindless masses who travel in packs, killing anything that is different. They are attracted to malls, Facebook, and shop on Amazon. Vampires are blood sucking capitalist who suck the life out of everything...like Don and his 2 sons Uday and Qusay. Now there are good capitalists who try to save us from evil capitalists...and Hollywood has given us good vampires who try to protect us from bad vampires. Frankenstein represents man's quest for immortality while slasher films appeal to the primordial sex and violence urges in the hypothalamus. For some the stimulation is an overload, calming our aggression like Carl in the film. For others it is just a taste that creates a craving. I think I have gone on enough. I feel better now.

Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity. 4 1/2 stars.",1480464000,,1639,4.825622775800712

The plot: struggling writer needs a muse and he gets one who happens to be a zombie.",1405900800,,161,3.878787878787879
8319722,5,B001LT4136,"This is my favorite film to settle down with friends on the couch and watch for Valentine's Day.  Or for when friends renew their vows, get married, get divorced, get engaged, go on a date, tell me about a phone call, have a beer, smoke a cigarette or sneeze.  Perhaps not that often, come to think of it; but it should be!  Tasteful use of inference allowed me to see new things in the film the first 33 times I saw it.  To my eyes, the film is a labor of love and will be relevant to humanity so long as art - whatever form it takes -  is relevant to the species of Earth.  I am very pleased with this film; it is one of only a handful of DVDs I keep on my shelf and recommended the film to yet another friend just today.",1376956800,,723,3.9178082191780823
8319723,5,B001LT4136,Bought it just a recommendation and couldn't be happier. Excellent low budget movie with a great little story. Track a copy down for your collection.,1376265600,,149,5.0
8319724,2,B001LT4136,"Comedic horror films are a fine balance; too much comedy can overwhelm and kill the horror. Films that achieve this fine balance -- films with great laughs and true scares -- include AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, RE-ANIMATOR, and EVIL DEAD.

RED VICTORIA fails as horror.  It doesn't even try to scare.

Jim (played by Tony Brownrigg) is a mainstream writer who is pressured by his agent into writing a horror script. Jim hates horror, but does it for the money. Along the way, an evil muse appears in the form of a corpse (zombie?) and kills Jim's friends and associates to ""inspire"" Jim.

Some have compared RED VICTORIA to a sitcom, and it is -- a bad sitcom. The soundtrack is thick with upbeat songs and peppy music. Brownrigg's notion of acting is lots of zany mugging for the camera.  ""Ain't this wacky?!"" he seems to be winking at the audience.

Jim talks to himself when he's alone in a room, as if he were Woody Allen, or stuck in a Neil Simon play.

The film is full of clich&eacute;s, misconceptions, and old satirical targets. For instance, the clich&eacute; of the greedy agent who pressures a talented writer into doing horror, because it's a ""surefire money-maker.""  In truth, agents don't need to pressure writers to create horror -- horror writers are everywhere. And the market is glutted with indie horror films seeking distributors. Hardly a ""surefire"" money-making genre.

RED VICTORIA is also marred by self-indulgence. Since Brownrigg is the writer, director, producer, and star, nobody on the set held him back. Almost every scene runs on too long. Several times, I fast-forwarded, having gotten the gist of yet another ""scene that wouldn't end,"" and anxious to get on with the story.

Arianne Martin is much better as the muse, because, for whatever reason, she doesn't mug or overact. She's a subtle foil to Brownrigg's mugging -- but the contrast only makes Brownrigg look worse.

Christian Taylor has a funny bit role as Blake, Jim's pseudo-intellectual friend. Taylor delivers his satirical lines (which he improvised, according to the DVD's special features) in deadpan fashion -- a funnier choice than Brownrigg's mugging.

Yet despite Martin and Taylor's good efforts, RED VICTORIA needs less of Brownrigg, much less of Brownrigg's mugging, shorter scenes, and less peppy music.  It needs more darkness to balance the humor.

The first 70-75 minutes are a straight (and unfunny) comedy. Then about 5 minutes of romance. And then 5 minutes of darkness, where it actually begins to get scary.  Then the end credits.

I'm being generous with the 2 stars, but the film did get a little interesting toward the end, as the romance and darkness finally began to emerge. And the film's not so bad, provided you have a trusty fast-forward button on your DVD remote.",1313020800,,2791,4.906382978723404
8319725,3,B001LT4136,"Wow, the other two reviewers really enjoyed this......

I kinda enjoyed it, but it has one fatal flaw.... it totally loses it's way in the final ten to fifteen minutes and just about everything goes wrong...

This is a low budget flick, and the actress playing Victoria isn't truly up to the job.  The two males leads are quite good though.  The plot about a writer being forced to compose a horror title gets pushed to the side for the most part - instead the film is really about the writer trying to get rid of Victoria.

It tries to be all culty, and funny....  but it's just not happening.  There's no over-the-top gore, or really any great one liners.  And no nudity either.  Sorry, it's what I'd have expected of a cult movie wannabe (and if it's not trying to be a cult film, just whom is this for?!?!)

Look, you're got to see Shaun of the Dead, or Slither if you want to see how horror comedy should be done.  Because this one really doesn't work all that well.

And what they were thinking with that final ten minutes I don't know - way to bring the audience down dudes!",1238889600,,1081,4.297029702970297
8319726,5,B001LT4136,"My friend in NY told me about this movie and how good it is. He was right!
If you like movies that are uniquely original that are well made you'll love Red Victoria. This guy will be on the A director list soon. Also, the DVD extra's are great. Loved the special effects section..",1237248000,,280,4.203703703703703
8319727,5,B001LT4136,"Anthony Brownrigg, son of cult filmmaker S.F. Brownrigg (DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT, KEEP MY GRAVE OPEN, SCUM OF THE EARTH), wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this film. He spent very little money to create this film, originally as a ""resume"" piece to help him secure funding for another project. However, his film is so well done, the acting is so superb, and the story so fantastic, it has become a breakout hit and is generating a lot of buzz.  I was fortunate enough to attend the screening at Texas Frightmare Weekend 2008, where the film was made available for sale on limited distribution DVD, and it was awarded the coveted AUDIENCE CHOICE AWARD.

Arianne Martin plays an undead muse who comes to inspire Tim to write a good horror screenplay. Tim believes horror is low-brow opiate for the masses and hardly worthy of his intelligence. Victoria, the undead muse, inspires him by killing a few people, working to induce horrific situations, and teaching him about the emotion of horror. Carl, played by Edward Landers, is a horror fan and a friend of Tim's who is also enlisted to help Tim gain the knowledge necessary to write this horror film. Arianne, Tony, and Ed create memorable scenes, their acting is supreme, and their interactions are natural and very believable.

Memorable moments include a horror film adaptation of the infamous Who's On First, a finger poked deep into an eye socket, and the ending which I will not reveal here.

I will be purchasing the released DVD for the many new extras including a very fun ""zombie dance"" by the lovely Arianne Martin that are not available on the limited distribution DVD I currently own.

This film is a must-see for horror fans, comedy fans, and fans of great independent low-budget cinematic brilliance.",1232755200,5,1776,4.848184818481848
