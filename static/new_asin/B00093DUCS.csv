8057010,5,B00093DUCS,"The emotional vehicle here is a ""universal"" -- Handsome guy going crazy because of duplicitous women. Revolves around sex and pregnancy. This is not about felines and it is not a horror movie. The title can be misleading. The ""cat"" is a gimmick probably to say that we will be watching this guy as though the cat in the apartment is watching everything. But it might also refer to woman as cat stalking her prey.

The strongest part of the film is maybe the guy being driven kind of crazy by not knowing what the heck is going on and his mixed sex/love feelings for the two women in the film. Should he give up on the supposedly but maybe not dead heart throb and settle down with her best friend Gigi, or keep his hope alive and keep trying to figure it all out?  He does a good job of playing a frustrated half-crazed stud who is being jacked around. Nearly all in French, of course, with English subtitles.

It is sort of artsy and well photographed, all filmed in a small interesting apartment and revolves around the crazed guy Simon and a couple of women who were best friends and that he has sex with on screen. Then there is a colourful landlord and a neighbour thrown in that are entertaining to watch (but all this is very serious, not funny).

This is not just a ""who done it"" but a ""who done what?"" His heart throb Pauline is supposedly dead, suicide in Calcutta, but all the pieces don't fit and the more pieces accumulate the stranger the mystery gets. We see Pauline in flashbacks. Her best friend Gigi comforts him aggressively with her feminine parts as he goes crazy with frustration and confusion. What are friends for?

The plot is hard to follow because the facts show up in faxes in the trash, voicemails etc. But by the end it is very clear basically what has been going on.

I won't go into the ending because this is basically a suspense film. You may guess the ending as a general matter but probably as one of several possibilities for what happened with Pauline etc.

It is one of those European-type films where the who done it (what) is not as important in any event as going back and reflecting on the characters and on the game that was being played. Like at the end, poor sap what will he be going through emotionally when he walks in the door and sees it all? Has he not been through enough?

I thought the film was much better than most who done it (or done what) films but I do like the Hollywood types as well and this is not of that type. It is more low budget, though attractive with good production values. It is open to a bit of nit-picking on a few small details, but aren't they all?",1332806400,,2626,4.323170731707317
