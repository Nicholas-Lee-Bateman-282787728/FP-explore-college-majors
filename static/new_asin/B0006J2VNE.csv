8041809,4,B0006J2VNE,"This WORLD WAR 2 thriller boasts a good  yet misplaced  cast in a picture that should have been a lot better and certainly doesn't compare to McLaglens'  earlier work; especially with Burton, who wasn't too well at the time, and it reflects here on screen. It sure is a thrill, though, bunching these great actors together in this otherwise cheap looking affair ;sort of an incomplete feel about it .Looking really confused in this European  co-production indeed , has  the cast looking (acting) as though they're waiting for the next page of script delivery. Not on DVD and should be, this at least for me is pure fun to see these great older stars TOGETHER in one film. Robert Mitchum,  Richard Burton,  Curt Jurgens, (they were also in 'THE LONGEST DAY"" ""62 WAR-EPIC.) .Rod Steiger ,  and the neglected -through -the-years Michael Parks also star. This was near the ENDGAME  for films on this scale and type;  because for the icons--  and for that type of filmmaking, -- this  era  was swiftly put into past-tense ..",1513468800,,1019,4.721590909090909

8041812,5,B0006J2VNE,"I have never seen or heard of this until I came across it on internet. I love WWII movies that are more than just action and violence and gore.
This has action but it also has a great story and of course with Robert Mitchum and Burton along with Michael Parks and Rod Steiger it's
a great WWII movie. I have to say I wouldn't pay 99.00 for a VHS of this but I would pay to have on VHS or DVD at a reasonable price.
It's hard to believe this movie isn't more popular and not shown much on TV because as a kid I use to watch old movies on TV reruns
and I have never seen this. I have to say the ending is really good and not what I expected which  is always good. This is a must see
and have for fans of WWII movies and Mitchum and Burton. Hope it's released on DVD someday! they don't make this this anymore!",1459987200,,807,3.86144578313253
8041813,4,B0006J2VNE,"Epic KLUNKER makes satirical fun of what it did not intend to.
The major excuse for watching this is more Sgt. Steiner from the novel and amazing film version of The Cross of Iron. That movie has not been served poorly in home release and could use an American friendly blu ray, giving us the full movie. This knock-off sequel has been followed by plots to kill Hitler  containing  both realism and satire. This one is just a schlock excuse to resurrect Steiner, a legendary fictional German good guy who fought Russians and Nazi officer pigs.
I suggest you relax and enjoy the splendid cast, mostly coasting through this puffery. Steiner played by Burton is too old and too majestically cool without the fun of John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn. Expect the plot, acting, and effects to be bad. Just watch for the fun of it and shake your head.
For serious Steiner read the novel by Heinrich and see the film of The Cross of Iron. Don't wait for Breakthrough to appear on dvd, however. I doubt even Echo Bridge will include it on an 8-pack",1458345600,,1035,4.529411764705882

8041816,3,B0006J2VNE,"I first saw ""Breakthrough"" thirty years ago on HBO when it was one of the few movies that channel ever showed.  It was for me - a child of ten, my favorite film (next to ""ATTACK FORCE Z"" - which HBO also played repeatedly) of all time.  How I wanted to be like Burton's Steiner, and when we went outside to play with our cap guns, that's who my mind's eye always envisioned me as.  ""Breakthrough"" remained a favorite of mine for many years, garnishing many wonderful memories, and holding a special place in my heart.

A few weeks ago, the FILMZ channel actually showed it - albeit under the wrong film title (they displayed it as WILD GEESE - another favorite of mine)... well, what I experienced was not quite what my memory had held and cherished all these years, and my new opinion goes a little more like this:

A film can usually be judged on its own merits. But a film claiming to be a sequel to Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" and featuring some of the greatest actors who ever lived needs to be held to a high standard. ""Breakthrough"" is a waste of time and fails in virtually all departments.

The plot cannot be taken seriously. It begins in late May of 1944, during the German retreat on the Eastern Front. ""Cross of Iron"" is set in January of 1943, yet our sequel begins where it left off, yet it's almost 16 months later. We are immediately introduced to several familiar characters, none of whom seem to measure up with their personalities from the original film. Sergeant Steiner (Richard Burton) is ordered by Captain Stransky (Helmut Griem) to blow up a railroad tunnel in order to prevent the Russians from using it. Steiner's squad fails miserably. Stop again: Coburn's Steiner was a crack NCO. He wiped out several different Russian outposts, patrols and tanks - with style. It's out of character for Steiner to be defeated to easily by one lousy Russian tank.

Anyway: Steiner takes a breather in Paris, right as the Allies land in Normandy. His unit is transported to France, where they occupy the village of St. Bologne. General Hoffman (Curd Jurgens) appears and orders Steiner to cross the enemy lines and inform the American commanders (Robert Mitchum and Rod Steiger) that the German high command is plotting to assassinate Hitler and would like to surrender. This plan comes undone, and the American forces move to attack St. Bologne - which Stransky has planned to blow up - a plot which will wipe out the attackers and the civilian inhabitants.

That's quite a bit to cram into one film, and McLaglen doesn't seem to know where he's going with this material. This is a very open-ended film, with little to link the sequence of events except pure coincidence. The script is serviceable on its own, but nothing here compares to ""Cross"". For starters, this new film ignores the last ten minutes or so of ""Cross"" and picks up right after the death of Lt. Triebig. Steiner appears to have no remorse against Stransky and, along with Kruger (Klaus Lowitsch) and Anselm (Dieter Schidor), joins the retreating force. Burton's portrayal of Steiner is simply unacceptable. For one thing, he's a bit too old and haggard to be considered a combat sergeant. He never gets involved in any physical action for this exact reason. Instead, he merely delivers dialog with a phony German accent and kills just as many Americans as fellow Germans as he seems confused as to whose side he's on. Unlike Coburn's Steiner, Burton's fails to stand for anything: he is loyal to his men, but winds up killing several of them in order to keep a promise to Colonel Rogers (Mitchum).

The film also fails miserably because, despite a slew of Hollywood legends and some familiar German actors, the acting is banal and limited. Mitchum and Steiger are both wasted in mediocre roles as American officers. Steiger's part is particularly disappointing, as he always seems sincere but isn't given very much to work with. The only American actor in the ensemble who seems properly placed in Michael Parks in a small but seemingly-enjoyed role as Sgt. Anderson, who tags along with Mitchum on various dangerous outings. Dare I forget to mention the presence of the legendary Curd Jurgens, who gets little to do here but plays his typical typecast role of an aristocratic German General with gusto despite his obviously forced surroundings!

The cast is chock full of German supporting actors, all of whom are forced into roles beneath their acting ability. Helmut Griem (""The McKenzie Break"") is a pretty sorry stand-in for Maximilian Schell. He sure seems interested in getting his Iron Cross, but the theme is reduced to an occasional reference or gag. The new Stransky is nothing more than a typical, one-dimensional Nazi out for American blood. Klaus Lowitsch is back and is a lot of fun as Corporal Kruger, although his character has changed, too: now he's wearing a German uniform and it's hard to tell if his cynicism is sincere. Werner Pochath (""Wartime"") is a predictable pervert amongst the ranks of Steiner's squad; Gunter Meisner (""Is Paris Burning?"") pops up in his usual role as a creepy SS officer; Horst Janson (""Shout at the Devil"") is completely wasted as Steiner's company commander; even Joachim Hansen (""The Eagle has Landed"") has a minimal role as Hoffman's aide. This film yearns for James Mason and David Warner, whose characters are simply forgotten in the midst of the chaos.

On its own, ""Breakthrough"" still fails to make any sort of impression (unless you're a ten year old kid). The lack of budgetary restrictions show up in nearly every frame. The first few scenes are composed almost entirely of stock footage from ""Cross of Iron"" and ""The Battle of Neretva"", while the rest feature a tremendous lack of extras and flair. We rarely see more than half-dozen actors on screen at one time, and the battle in the St. Bologne uses many of the same shots more than once, alternate takes of some shots, and some rather shabby soundstages. The direction always seems pretty standard and unimaginative; McLaglen, who's usually at least a competent director, doesn't take any chances in this film. Nothing happens that we haven't seen before, and the lack of flair makes the whole affair seem even more pedestrian. The music score is ill-fitting and badly written. It's composed mostly of symphonic cues which belong in a spaghetti western - or perhaps one of Antonio Margheriti's early sci-fi adventures - but certainly not an anti-war film! Fans of the cast will be disappointed. Fans of its predecessor will be severely disappointed. It's even a let-down for me, and I carried this one in my heart as a favorite all through my youth on into adulthood.",1340496000,12,6665,4.797038327526132
