589945,4,6303165680,"It is so unfortunate that Andie MacDowell practically destroys, in the final seconds of this film, all that has been so carefully created up until that moment.  Hugh Grant and his merry band of friends are exceptional; the  premise beguiling, and heartfelt.  A gay relationship is of particular  note, and provides the movie its one throat-closing moment.  However,  screenplay and most performances must depend on the believability of the  Grant-MacDowell connection, and Andie is simply not up to the challenge.  By contrast, Kristin Scott Thomas is the most electrifyingly real as she  has ever been, in a slim but significant role.  Charming, diverting --  could have been a classic, if we were rooting for them in the end...",962064000,6,729,5.093220338983051
589946,5,6303165680,"This utterly charming, little British film took me completely by surprise  the first time I saw it.  I did not know what to expect going in, but I  quickly found myself falling completely in love with it.
The plot is  structured around the five events mentioned in the title.  A magnificent  group of seven dear friends attends a string of weddings, none of them,  unfortunately, involving any of the principles.  Our focus is on Charles  (Hugh Grant), a devilishly handsome man who is completely incapable of  committing to marriage.  He is, as an ex-girlfriend describes him, a  ""serial monogamist.""
There is some hope, however, that that might change  when Charles meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell), a beautiful American woman.  He falls in love with her, and we suspect she might love him, too, but  instead she gets engaged to Hamish (Corin Redgrave), a boring, but rich  man, twice her age.  Our hearts break along with Charles' because we know  that she is making a mistake.  He is too disappointed, though, and too  afraid to do anything about it.
There is something so pleasing about  friendship in a movie.  When it is done right, as it is here, it involves  the audience in a way that most stories cannot.  While watching this film,  I could not help but wish that I knew them all better.  Who wouldn't want a  group of such trusted and wonderful friends?  Because we like them, and  because we feel we know them so well, the events in the film aren't just  happening to somebody else.  They are happening to us as well.  That is why  ""Four Weddings"" is so touching and so moving.
The acting is  nothing short of brilliant, especially the work done by Hugh Grant.  Not  since Cary Grant has an actor displayed such suave, British charm and  natural good looks.  He is a delight to watch and, no doubt, has an  excellent future ahead for himself.  Andie MacDowell is equally enchanting.  She has never appeared as lovely in a movie before as she does here.
The  screenplay by Richard Curtis is extremely well written.  The scenes have  the ring of truth to them; the characters feel as real as anyone we know.  The writing always hits just the right note, striking a delicate balance  between moments of great humor and romance, as well as deep sadness.
Mike  Newell's direction is fine, never distracting us the center of the film:  the characters and their words.  At the same time, there are moments of  inspired visual artistry.  The sight of Charles arriving late for Carrie's  wedding, standing alone in a broad, Scottish moor, is touchingly sad.  Even  better is the funeral chapel, stranded in a bleak, industrial wasteland,  overlooking the dull, gray Thames.  It is a very evocative and poignant  moment.
I do not want to give the impression that this is a sad film  because it is not.  At times it is rather hilarious, the romance is always  enticing, and it does have a happy, if unexpected, ending.  More  importantly, all of its emotions are genuinely earned.  ""Four  Weddings and a Funeral"" is one of the most delightful films I have  seen in a long time.",959212800,20,3077,4.674199623352166
589947,4,6303165680,"This movie features memorable comic vignettes and great insights into relationships, love and fear of commitment. The mumbling Hugh Grant delivers an effortlessly charming performance, he is rapidly becoming the  British Cary Grant. Also extremely good supporting cast. Unfortunately  Andie MacDowell doesn't add enough life to her important character and  makes 'Carrie' almost lifeless and dull, which is the exact opposite of  Kristin Scott Thomas performance which is quiet but right on the money. The  whole movie is ultimately entertaining, fun and very funny at times. The  ending is out of place and doesn't seem as smart as the rest of the film.  From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!",956448000,5,698,5.0701754385964914

590004,1,6303165680,I tried to watch this oldie. I had seen in when it was released in the 1990's. Then I was bemused by the ethnicity of it. It is classic British comedy. I actually hate the movie now. It literally made me sick. Feckless British twits with nothing to recommend them as human beings. Irritating Americans with dollar signs in their eyes. And the never-ending idiotic wedding ceremonies with their oppressive religion ! Gag me!! I realize how many crappy movies have been released since the beginning of the film industry over a century ago. I saw this via Tribeca Short list.

590005,5,6303165680,"The film that made Hugh Grant into a movie star is just as delightful as it ever was. Four weddings and a Funeral  was a British import that took America by storm years ago, and for good reason. The writing is sharp, witty, touching, and delightful. As romantic comedies go you can't go wrong with this. The chemistry between the cast is electric, and ultimately even though Hugh is the star of the show the movie is at its very best when the ensemble is working together, because you believe whole heartedly that these people have been friends for years. Kristen Scott Thomas is Amazing as the icy but lovable Fiona, and Andie MacDowell works brilliantly against Hugh Grant.

during the nuptials, all held in wonderful old churches, and times of genuine anguish during
the send off for a happy, colorful British gentleman. Hugh Grant plays a guy who falls in love
with an American, played by Andie MacDowell, but can't quite land her. I love this film that

HOWEVER:

I watched this on STARZ add-on through Prime Video and the movie is compromised by the lack of subtitles at the sign language parts.  I'm confused as to why/how they have been stripped as they appeared in the original theater release and every version I've ever seen.  It really compromises the movie as there are important plot points (and funny parts) that occur in sign language only.  It's truly a shame!

Overall:
Movie itself - 5 stars
Playback through Amazon Video (STARZ add-on subscription) - 0 stars

So for character development we have a slut who enjoys the carousel getting married.  Approximately 85% of marriages with this kind of notch count end in divorce. And presto the marriage doesn't last a year.  I wonder how much she got in her divorce settlement.  Give Charlie credit on getting her to agree to live together without marriage.  He will save a lot of money.  There is another scene where Charlie is talking to a man he new and asked if he was still going with his girlfriend and was told no.  Charlie replies that the girlfriend was no great loss since she was shagging someone else.  The friend says he married her.  Latter we see the poor fellow sitting next to his wife completely at wits end.  Yes this is a delightful little gem showing the true nature of women.,1472083200,,951,4.402298850574713

590486,5,6303165680,"This was the first of several films by screenwriter Richard Curtis to feature Hugh Grant, following with Bridget Jones's Diary, Notting Hill, and Love Actually (also directed by Curtis) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. Curtis natural flair for witty romantic comedy and Grants boyish way with romantic attachments made the pairing unusually successful. Curtis achieved his breakthrough success with Four Weddings and a Funeral. The film, starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, was produced on a limited budget by the British production company Working Title Films. Inspiration for the film came when Curtis was flipping through some old diaries and realized that he had been to 72 weddings in 10 years. New Zealand-born English screenwriter Curtis, already a successful British comedy writer for TV and films, chose Mike Newell to direct the film after watching his TV film Ready When You Are, Mr. McGill. Four Weddings and a Funeral proved to be the top-grossing British film in history at that time. It made an international star of Grant, and Curtis' Oscar nomination for the script catapulted him to prominence. At one point, Alan Rickman was being considered for the role of Charles. Richard Curtis fought for him, but in the end it was decided he was too old for the part. While making the film, Hugh Grant thought the movie was awful. Grant had to learn British Sign Language for his scenes with his deaf brother, played by David Bower, who is deaf in real life. The poem read in the funeral is called ""Funeral Blues"" by W.H. Auden.  The film also features Simon Callow, John Hannah, Kristin Scott Thomas, Charlotte Coleman, Rowan Atkinson and Corin Redgrave. The film follows the adventures of a group of friends through the eyes of Charles (Grant), a good-natured but socially awkward Englishman living in London, who becomes smitten with Carrie (MacDowell), an American whom Charles meets at four weddings and a funeral. The original score was composed by British composer Richard Rodney Bennett. The movie also featured a soundtrack of popular songs, including a cover version of The Troggs' ""Love Is All Around"" performed by Wet Wet Wet that remained at number one in the British charts for fifteen weeks and was then the ninth (now twelfth) biggest selling single of all time in Britain. This song would later be adapted into ""Christmas Is All Around"" and sung by the character of Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) in Richard Curtis' 2003 film Love Actually. The film was very well received with critics, becoming an unexpected success with worldwide box office in excess of $245.7 million, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, as well as Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.",1466035200,,2726,5.030973451327434

590488,4,6303165680,"This a pleasant film to sit through, but was probably somewhat overrated at the time of its release back in 1994. The cast are uniformly good, and it does have some very funny moments; however it is also quite superficial and the character of Carrie is paper thin. Even in a film that's going all out to entertain, you need to feel there is some logic to the actions of characters, but here we are expected to believe that this American would marry a man when she has already met Charles (Hugh Grant) and realised they felt a mutual attraction; then when her marriage predictably falls through, she turns up on Charles's wedding to someone else. It is hard to believe in the ingenuousness of this and the film fails really. However if you take it very lightly, there is plenty to enjoy, outstanding ensemble playing, Grant as good as ever in his tongue-tied way, and James Fleet and John Hannah perhaps sharing the honours as moving characters who manage to give the screenplay more relevance to life that it strictly deserves. The funeral sequence is the most convincing - which is not a good sign in a comedy - nevertheless this part is moving and Hannah plays it perfectly.",1464998400,,1176,4.604761904761904

ANDYMCDOWELL: ""oh Hugh grant I know your madly in love with me and would do anything for me but I'm getting married so let me sleep with you and rip your soul to fowl bits, just for s***s and giggles of course!!""

HUGHGRANT: ""Um ok sure!""

I hate romantic comedies so for this one I watched for my mom whose just a 50yr old version of Taylor Swift. Please don't waste ur time or money on this- it's basically 500 Days of Summer only Zooey Dacheanel is WAY PAINFULLY more annoying. Also Andy's character was a pain she just kept popping up everywhere causing poor Grant such awkward agony. A good different kind of love story would be ""
""only lovers left alive""
""Conviction""

590624,2,6303165680,"The problem with this ""romantic comedy"" is that it's not as funny nor is it as romantic as it's trying to be. And it's far from being this classic that people are making it out to be. Maybe it was funny when it was first released, but it's painfully dated now. Some parts of it are funny (the first 20 minutes or so), but it loses steam pretty quickly and becomes less and less funny as it goes on. Four Weddings and a Funeral is all in all pretty boring, honestly, and in the grand scale of everything about it, it's just not realistic, relatable, or likeable.",1451692800,,561,4.252336448598131

Hugh Grant has played this character over & over again to the point where he has grown stale, but this was his first real comedy and if you've never watched him before, you'll enjoy his performance. The character actors are well-cast--especially Kristen Scott Thomas--one wishes she had been given more to do. The biggest problem in the film is Andie McDowell; she is painful to watch & is clueless in how to carry off comedy. Perhaps the small budget prevented the producer from casting someone more accomplished.

She put on a dress to appeal to Chopin, but her advances never worked--until she convinced him of her sincere love and admiration.

Am I really supposed to believe that this couple fell madly in love over four or five meetings in which they barely speak?  We can assume that they actually talk more at times we don't see them--i.e. before and after their rendezvous--but onscreen, their relationship remains utterly flat, the characters undeveloped, their relationship apparently based entirely on fantasy.  The actors did remarkably well with what little they had to work with, but I never once cared about these characters and was inexplicably more interested in the friends, whose names I had to look up on IMDb to know because they're so rarely named in the movie.  Then, by the end, we are expected to glean some anti-wedding/marriage message that the plot has no business invoking--not because there's no set up (although I'd argue that the film does a great job of depicting only the worst reasons to get married) but because the characters are untrustworthy for any meaningful commentary.",1432252800,3,1033,4.953757225433526

Acting is on the highest level, in fact it is much higher than the film requires and that is what lifts it from the sea of mediocrity that these films usually fall prey too. That is with the exception of the lovely, Andie Macdowell, who has shown such promise in Sex, Lies, and Videotape, and in a Calvin Kline Commercial or two, has left that promise behind and astounds with flat line readings and bland emoting that distracts more than it involves. Ms. MacDowell, isn't bad throughout, I'm a little bitchy, but it is a pity because she is crucial to the film. But, do not dispair, everyone else if phenomenal. From Hugh Grant to Kristin Scott Thomas to the delisously enthusiastic Simon Callow.  It is a lovely film, buy it, or at the very least, rent it.

591137,4,6303165680,"This film seems to have been 15 years ahead of time. Given the current belief that same-sex marriage is actually //promoting// other-sex marriage, it deserves a re-evaluation.

Love at first sight (for reasons //other// than sexual) does occur (it's happened to me), when you know in a moment //that person// is the one you've been looking for. This is virtually impossible to dramatize, because the audience needs to know //why// the attraction occurs -- and that requires understanding the people before they meet.

This is where the film falls down, particularly with regard to Charles (Hugh Grant). He's winsome/winning (in a clumsy sort of way), and it's obvious the women who like him aren't attracted //solely// for sexual reasons. But what are those reasons? Are they fond of puppies?

The attraction among the heterosexual characters seems almost taken for granted, as if ""that's the way things are"". They might be, but we still wonder why. It's particularly annoying that we don't really know why Carrie passed over Charles for Hamish, or why they broke up. It seems to be a convenient plot twist to throw Charles for a loop. (""Frasier"" had 11 years to develop its characters, and by the end we had a pretty good idea who they were and how they would react in a given situation. This is difficult to do in a two-hour film.)

Only Gareth and Matthew's relationship is convincing. Gareth (played by the gay-in-real-life Simon Callow) is a sweet/loud/vulgar person who could easily attract friends of either sex. We have no trouble understanding what Matthew sees in him -- in part because male/male friendships are more-comprehensible than male/female. When Matthew delivers the funeral eulogy, we are genuinely touched, in a way that doesn't occur when the hetero couples get married.

Ultimately, the film has little new to say about relationships and marriage. Perhaps it isn't supposed to, but that doesn't make it any less disappointing.",1401408000,,1950,5.062305295950155

591200,1,6303165680,"I was alarmed at how promiscuous the female protagonist is.  Since when has it been OK to be anything other than a female virgin on your wedding day?  The fact that Hugh Grant's character failed to see through this wanton woman is beyond me.  Non-virgin wives are bad bets for marriage.  Hollywood should stop feeding the urban leg-spreaders rom-coms like this if they hope to inspire young women to value chastity and modesty.

I don't recommend this movie for any kind of under-21 audience for the brief nude scenes, the profanity, and the rampant sexuality.  This is definitely inappropriate for our young women hoping to find role models in the media.  I recommend wholesome rom-coms from the 1920s to the 1980s, and especially those that feature such men as Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant.  Movies such as ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Casablanca"" prioritize values-based courtships over physiological responses to attractive stimuli disguised as ""chemistry""-based courtships and offer good instruction to young women who aspire to marry well.

Young girls, take heart: virtuous women who save themselves for marriage get attractive husbands, not promiscuous ones.  Aspire to become the wife of an important man, not a washed-up bimbo in an age heterogamous relationship with a penchant for stringing along innocent, hardworking men like Hugh Grant's character.  High-achieving men don't like women who play games, nor do they hope to marry an evil harridan incapable of respecting male boundaries.",1386115200,6,1499,5.256302521008403

Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell are just bubbling with chemistry and the rest of the cast is wonderful. It is a sweet, funny and intelligent film, with over the top directing and writing. Impromptu is a partly fictionalized version of the romance between the Polish Composer Fredrich Chopin and the woman writer George Sand. Judy Davis is amazing as Sand and Hugh Grant is perfect as the sickly Chopin. Emma Thompson is hilarious as the art starved Duchess. Again the exquisite writing and directing by James Lapine makes this a must see, and is much less fictionalized than  Amadeus, where 90% of the story is made up for commercial reasons, like so many movies on famous people, like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, where all the spy stuff is made up to sell tickets. The Paradise film is a flop as there is no chemistry between male and female lead. And the writing is clunky.

This film deserves nothing less than a full 6k restoration from the original camera negatives and audio elements.  What you get here instead is a wobbly, scratched, and dirty print with gobs of edge enhancement slapped on to try and beef up the inherent softness in the image.  Don't let the extremely high average MPEG-4 video bitrate listed on the package fool you... it's the old adage of garbage in, garbage out.

It reminds me a lot of the typical cruddy treatment Universal heaps upon its catalog titles (unless it happens to be named ""E.T."" or ""Jaws""... and then Laser Pacific does the work).

591376,2,6303165680,"This is the film that did it for me.  The story is so good, so darn clever, and I find Hugh Grant's performance utterly charming.  But Andie MacDowell spoiled this entire film for me.  Most pick on the final scene where she utters the film's last line as confirmation of her bad acting, but I think the problem existed long before.  It is just that she was so conspicuously bad in that particular scene.  You couldn't ignore it.  She absolutely shattered the mood, so I was picking off glass, and I could hear groans.  Her voice was so bizarre, it was like someone farted during a period of reverence.  Before watching this film, I had no opinion about Andie MacDowell, but afterwards, I concede I developed a definite animus.  I'm forgiving with actors - as long as they don't ruin the story or are at least entertaining, I really don't care.  I mean neither Jackie Chan or Jean-Claude Van Damme can act, but at least they have some modicum of credibility.  I can't say that about Andie MacDowell.  She ruined this entire film for me.  I realized she could not emote during the scene when she was recounting her lovers.  She was the star, the focus was on her.  You could see Hugh Grant's obvious distress, but her face was as blank as a plate.  No inflection.  No nothing.  Even her voice didn't sound natural.  I didn't believe a word she said.  If the producers had brought on someone who was at least human, or someone who could speak in more than a robotic voice, then this film would have been stellar.  Andie MacDowell was good in sex, lies and videotape, because the character was stiff, frigid and emotionally stunted, but she hasn't been able to duplicate that caliber of performance (or her just being herself).  Surprisingly, Andie MacDowell was actually nominated for a Golden Globe for this role.  The Golden Globes have lost all credibility, and I have no doubt it would nominate a shoe sole if it can nominate Ms. MacDowell.  The film could be good, but it was utterly ruined by Andie MacDowell, so I can't recommend it unless one wants to see how bad an actress she is.  What I mourn is the loss of potential.  This could have been a great film - only if she was removed.  I would hire Andie MacDowell's agent in a heartbeat.  He could sell anything.",1346198400,4,2268,4.519704433497537

591379,5,6303165680,"This generally popular classic film is so well-known that further comment as regards its content is neither necessary nor relevant to this update review which relates specifically to the new Blu-ray edition. Whether or not the film is liked is not the point of the following upgrade comment.

Although it is generally true that most Blu-rays offer extra image definition and sonics over the previous DVD version/s there is not always a huge difference achieved. This may simply be because the original DVD is so recent that most of the technical information is already encoded into the DVD. Sometimes the transfer to Blu-ray simply lacks due care to be worthwhile.

However there are occasions where extra effort has apparently been made and where all the above provisos no longer apply. This is one such film. The improvement is quite remarkable with a tremendous improvement apparent throughout the process of restoration. In particular the DVD letterbox imaging has been replaced with full screen imaging and the soundtrack has far greater range. Both imaging and sound have greater definition than offered on the previous DVD.

Provided that reasonable allowance is made for the age of the original film stock, it would be reasonable to expect most purchasers to be more than satisfied with this transfer to Blu-ray. In my opinion this improvement is a real 5 star achievement and the restoration team deserves success for their efforts.",1338681600,5,1441,5.123404255319149

591400,5,6303165680,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 'BLU RAY' REISSUE ***

I recently reviewed the BLU RAY reissue of ""Love Actually"" - commenting on how beautiful the picture quality had suddenly become over the preceding DVD versions. Well - somebody seems to be taking care of business here too - because the print on this BR reissue of ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" is exceptional also - especially given what's gone before.

Filmed in the summer of 1993 and released in the spring of 1994 - Director Mike Newell and Producer Tim Bevan took a big chance on a then largely unknown Hugh Grant as the male lead. Playing Charles - a nice but bumbling 32-year old British bachelor - he's the love interest for the sophisticated and sexy American socialite Carrie (Andie MacDowell hot from her successes in ""Green Card"" and ""Groundhog Day""). With six hundred thousand dollars lopped off their budget and only 38 days to shoot - it cost very little to make - and therefore when it became a global phenomenon it eventually grossed over $250 million in profit worldwide. ""Four Weddings..."" also made stars of Hugh Grant (and Liz Hurley in 'that' dress at the London premier). It laid the ground for so many British rom-coms to follow - highlighted the classiness of Kristin Scott-Thomas (""The English Patient"") - Rowan Atkinson as a comedic genius - John Hannah as the thinking-woman's crumpet - and of course properly launched the 'film' career of England's best scriptwriter - Richard Curtis. It was even nominated for 2 Oscars - Best Film and Best Original Screenplay.

Clarity - starting with spotlessly clean PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and MGM logos - the BLU RAY bypasses a menu and goes straight into the credits - and as the principal characters are established in the opening montage - its clear that some kind of restoration has been done here. It looks really great - bright, clean and amazingly fresh. The picture is also automatically defaulted to a 16.9 aspect - so it fits your entire screen without losing any definition to stretching.

So much is visually improved in this transfer, but moments that stick out include - the scene outside the church after the first wedding where Charles spots Carrie across the churchyard - it's beautifully clear. When they are making their way back from the tent reception - drunk in a Land Rover singing ""Stand By Your Man"" - and Charles gets out of the car under some trees at night - it's 'so' clear. Charlotte Coleman as Charles' eccentric sister Scarlett and her scary dress sense - orange hat and purple dress - Rowan Atkinson as the trainee priest conducting his first wedding service and blowing almost every line - when Carrie turns up at the end in the doorway in the rain - all of it - just great. There are only a few occasions when you notice slight haze and blocking (Bernard and Lydia getting it on in the bedroom as Charles hides) - but mostly it's a joy to look at and really brings out the summery feel of it all - smartly dressed guests in sunny garden locations etc. It also shows a London landscape that has no Gherkin building, the lovely Lady Di was still with us and a person gave you a Fax number and not an e-mail address.

It's very funny too - the script is fantastic in so many places - Charles describing one of his posh friend's new look ""Tom...disastrous haircut..."" - Scott Thomas describing the dress of the first bride Laura ""...She looks like a big meringue..."" - George the boor at the Boatman pub thinking he's in with the American sexpot - ""Damn fine filly..."" - Charles confiding in Matthew (John Hannah) about fluffing an attempt at wooing the same - ""Do you think there really are people who can say...Hi Baby! My name is Charles! And this is your lucky night!"" And Matthew replies ""Well if there is...they're not English!""

And when actual heart is called for (tears instead of laughter) - Curtis gives John Hannah the speech at Gareth's funeral complete with the W.H. Auden poem ""Funeral Blues"" at the end (""Stop all the clocks...He was my North, my South, My East and My West...my Sunday Rest...""). It's still evocative to this day. Even the gay relationship between their characters was handled with joy and class and didn't focus on disease and ostracization.

Niggles - we've seen it too many times and it hasn't dated as well as ""Love Actually"" or ""Nothing Hill"" when it comes to repeat viewing. The terrible Elton John at the beginning. The lack of language subtitles shows an amazingly cavalier attitude to audiences outside of English speaking countries. The 'Extras' listed below are good - the 2004 versions put out on the DVD double (interviews with Grant, Newell, Callow, MacDowell etc) - but it would have been nice to have something new. But apart from those small points - there's little else. If only Terry Gilliam's film legacy was treated with such respect and smarts...

To sum up - an evergreen movie and a very satisfying transfer to BLU RAY. So if you've any affection for this lovely British/American romcom - then acquire this version of it pronto - especially as its relatively cheap.

Recommended.

591401,4,6303165680,"It was the surprise hit of 1994.

""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", a film directed by Mike Newell (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", ""Enchanting April"", ""Donnie Brasco"", ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"") and written by Richard Curtis (Mr. Bean"", ""Bridget Jones's Diary"", ""Notting Hill"" became the UK's highest-grossing film in history at the time (earning over $245 million worldwide) and also earning an Academy Award for ""Best Picture"".

The film would also jumpstart the career of Newell but also its leading actor, an unknown talent named Hugh Grant who would go on to become an International star with ""Notting Hill"", ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" and ""Bridget Jone's Diary"" and also boost the career of actress Kristin Scott Thomas and John Hannah to name a few.

VIDEO:

""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  I tend to be one of the few who tend to get critical of films released in the late '80s and early '90s and brought to Blu-ray because a lot of film stock at that time used for films were not the best.  Some films tend to look their age, some tend to look a bit soft.  For ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", actually picture quality leaned more towards the good side.

For one, scenes shot outdoors do showcase a good amount of color but at the same time, it does show its age where colors look a tad bit saturated.  But just a bit.  There is a good amount of grain and I did see some white speckles but for the most part, the film does look good, just don't expect picture quality compared to today's modern films.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Dolby Surround and French 5.1 DTS HD.  For this comedy, it's a dialogue-driven film with some music, so you can expect a more center and front-channel driven soundtrack.  Fortunately, there is use of the surround channels as you can hear ambiance, especially birds chirping all around you at times.  But it's not an immersive soundtrack but for this type of film and considering the age of the film, the lossless soundtrack is good.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary with Filmmakers - If you owned the original ""Deluxe Edition"" of the previous DVD, the wonderful audio commentary with comments from director Mike Newell and Richard Curtis as well as Duncan Kenworthy are included.  An in-depth and fun audio commentary worthy listening to!
  Four Weddings and a Funeral: In the Making Featurette - (7:45) Featuring interviews with the cast of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" about their role and behind-the-scenes footage from the film.
  The Wedding Planners - (29:48) Featuring the making of the film, the challenges experienced while making the film and how casting was made for the film.
  Two Actors and a Director Featurette - (5:41) Mike Newell talks about hiring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell including interviews with the two cast members.
  Deleted Scenes - (9:56) Featuring five deleted scenes with optional introductions by producer Duncan Kenworthy.
  Promotional Spots - Featuring two never-used promotional spots by Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell and featuring optional commentary by producer Duncan Kenworthy.
  Trailer - (2:08) Featuring the original theatrical trailer to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I was attending college, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" was the ultimate guy film which I saw many friends watch over and over and being the only guy around the group who had a girlfriend at the time, I would listen and hear them talk about how this movie spoke to them.

Does ""true love"" exist?  Is it better to be single and have fun?

And I really don't know how many times my friends had this playing on their VHS but this was a film that spoke to people on various levels.  Gave them hope!

As for me, the film didn't speak to me in terms of relationships but it further enhanced my appreciation for British comedies.  What I loved about the film was its various characters and while the film was primarily about Charles and Carrie, its the other supporting cast that I found entertaining and helped enhance the storyline around Charles.

And sure enough, the film made Hugh Grant a star and Mike Newell, he would go on to make blockbuster films.  I was surprised to see Kristin Scott Thomas in a more smaller role but watching this film back then, I had no doubt in my mind we would be seeing more of Thomas in cinema and similar to Grant, we would see more of Thomas in films such as ""Mission Impossible"" and  ""The English Patient"".  And another actor who would also gain from being part of the film is John Hannah who went on to work on ""The Mummy"" films.

For the most part, everyone gave a solid performance in the film. If there was one person that actually irked me back then, it was Andie MacDowell's character as Carrie.  For someone who knows people of great influence and someone who looked as if she was an intellectual, somehow her character and the lines she was given were almost making her come out looking like an airhead.  But then again, perhaps I was too enamored by her in ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Short Cuts"" back then.

As for the Blu-ray release, I know that many people own the Deluxe Edition DVD that came out in 2006 which has the same special features featured on this Blu-ray.  So, is it worth upgrading?  Well, because it's a catalog title, more than likely you are going to find this release for a lower price and if that is the case, then yes, it's definitely worth it to upgrade to an HD version, especially if you love the film, then definitely Blu-ray is the way go go..  But at the same time, it is not necessarily a film that showcases an immersive soundscape when it comes to lossless audio and as for the picture quality, just don't have huge expectations and expected significant differences PQ-wise over its DVD counterpart.

But if you haven't owned or even watched the film before, then yes, definitely give ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" a chance!  It's witty, fun and highly entertaining!

Overall, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is a film that many people love, some place it high amongst their top romantic comedies and as mentioned earlier, for some guys, this movie speaks to them, especially those wondering if ""true love"" exists.  For me, it was just a fun British comedy, nothing more, nothing less and I enjoyed it.

So, if you really love this film, then definitely upgrade to Blu-ray!",1323993600,5,6589,4.734855136084285

The Film 3.5/5

Four Weddings and a Funeral was released in 1994 and was a breakout role for Hugh Grant. If you have seen Notting Hill, Love Actually or the Bridget Jones movies, you'll know that Grant plays similar characters in every movie. Writer Richard Curtis wrote all of those screenplays and understands what Grant can do. He typically plays eloquent characters who are a bit confused about what they want in life. He has great comic timing and plays his roles with a lot of charm.

The movie opens with Charles (Grant) late for a wedding. We see him dash around with his flatmate, Scarlett, and drive like a maniac to reach the church on time. He's the best man, but he's forgotten to bring the rings. This opening sequence is pretty funny and sets the scene well.

Almost all of the action takes place at the four weddings and the funeral mentioned in the title. We are introduced to Charles and his friends, and they appear at every wedding. Tom (Fleet) is one of the richest men in Britain, but is clueless about women and doesn't have a girlfriend. He's amusing and harmless and reminds me of Colin Firth's character in Love Actually. Gareth embraces life and throws himself into any situation without stopping to worry whether he's making a fool of himself, while Matthew is his lover.

The story is full of good observations about human behavior. If you have ever been to a wedding, you'll recognize the types of character portrayed in the movie. Some are there because they genuinely want to be, but others tag along as an excuse to get drunk or to seek romantic partners of their own. Some are touching and others are embarrassing or annoying.

At the first wedding, Charles encounters Carrie (MacDowell). He likes her instantly and changes his plans so that he stays at the same inn. They have a romantic moment, but it quickly ends when Carrie announces that she has to return to America.

The rest of the movie shows meetings between Charles and Carrie at each of the weddings. Their situations change each time, but it's clear that they like each other. Charles runs into previous girlfriends continually, but considers marriage as something to be avoided for the most part. In contrast, Gareth thinks marriage is a good way to get out of a boring conversation.

Charles has a brother, David, who is deaf and communicates through sign language. That sets up a few of the funnier scenes when Charles lies about what David is saying. Another interesting character is Father Gerald; a young priest played by Rowan Atkinson. Most American viewers will know him as Mr. Bean, but he's appeared in numerous movies of this type as well as Blackadder, which was a TV series also written by Curtis. Father Gerald isn't a very good priest, but he'll probably make you laugh.

The movie succeeds because the characters are believable and similar to people we have encountered in our own lives. It's easy to identify with the main characters because the story rings true. It's above average in terms of romantic comedies and also works as pure comedy. Even if you don't care about Charles and Carrie, there's plenty to smile at. I wouldn't rate Four Weddings and a Funeral up there with Love Actually, but it's worth seeing.

Video Quality 3.5/5
Unless you bought Target's exclusive version in January, this is the first time you'll have had the chance to see Four Weddings and a Funeral on Blu-ray. The result is a clear upgrade, as you would expect, but it's not a stellar transfer by any means. The movie is plagued with minor scratches and dirt throughout the 118 minutes. The image is soft at times and clarity never threatens to dazzle the viewer. Colors are accurate, but a little subdued. I briefly considered a 3/5 rating, but I think most of the presentation deserves the extra half point. Fans of the movie should buy it, but temper expectations.

Audio Quality 4/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is more than adequate, but this isn't the kind of movie that makes full use of sound. It consists of dialogue-driven scenes for the most part, although the surrounds do add depth in the wedding reception scenes. I thought I detected minor sync issues in a couple of places, but they were brief.

Four Weddings and a Funeral is a lot of fun, and works well for fans of British humor. Grant and MacDowell play their roles well. The Blu-ray offers a reasonable upgrade and is worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of the movie or if you like romantic comedies. The price is very attractive at the moment and is readily available for under $12.

591403,5,6303165680,"On my only trip to England, in 1994, this movie was played on the way over on the British Airways flight.  I found it funny then -- or, more to the point, witty -- and I love it still, 17 years later.  Hugh Grant is at his best here -- urbane, hapless, smart and comical all at once.  The funeral sequence I've used repeatedly in my college English literature class to illustrate the intense effect the reading of a ""death poem"" can have, as the deceased man's closest friend reads W. H. Auden's ""Stop all the Clocks"".  (Auden captures the essence of loss without wallowing in morbid, lugubrious, maudlin language; I've never seen a more moving funeral service.)  Andie McDowell is charming, and the additon of Rowan Martin (""Mr. Bean"") as a novice, bungling clergyman, was an hysterically funny touch.  I highly recommend this movie, even to someone (mostly men, I imagine) who find romantic comedy unappealing.  Believe me, this is not your average ""chick flick"", guys.",1305331200,,971,4.778443113772455
591404,5,6303165680,"Hugh Grant is wonderfully charismatic and a master of self-deprecating humor. Being on a Hugh Grant kick lately I watched three of his films all in the same week. Love Actually, Sense & Sensibility, and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. Fun way to watch these movies because of the overlap in players and to understand classic British style: themes include tension between being proper and true to oneself, a wide cast of characters all intertwined, somehow, uncertainty of who will end up with who, extreme, offbeat secondary characters that are almost caricatures, and everything wrapped up neatly in the last 5-10 minutes of the film. This movie combines British and American themes, some as expected match ups and other surprises. Also rather British in that it is easier to describe who the movie is about as opposed to what the movie is about. Who it is about is an American woman and a British man who meet up at various mutual friends' weddings, seem meant for each other, but the timing for one, the other, or both always seems to be off. It is about missed opportunities and that oh so British theme of the struggle to be true to one's self in the face of opposing expectations. Four stars plus a bonus star for Hugh Grant.",1304899200,,1225,4.649769585253456

591430,5,6303165680,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994) is one of my favorite movies: well-acted, a rollicking romantic comedy with one serious, touching scene, and an overall feeling of the vitality and the spirit of life. The movie creates a gang of friends, each one interesting and fun to be with. It may be Hugh Grant's best film where he's able to balance his boyish charm with a more ruminative side. The gang gathers at a series of weddings, and through wonderful vignettes we get to know each one: the hippie girl, the deaf mute, the Charles Addams Morticia-looking woman, the flamboyant, joyful gay guy and his devoted lover, and the clutzy millionaire.
 At the one funeral scene in the movie, Gareth's lover, Matthew, delivers a very moving eulogy that always tears me up. He reads W.H. Auden's poem ""Funeral Blues"" otherwise known as ""Stop All the Clocks."" With the lines ""He was my North, my South, my East and West/I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong."" As in other British movies slapstick comedy like Monty Python can be paired with the deadly serious.
 The movie begins with Hugh and his Platonic roommate hippie girl buddy late to a wedding, and at a fast pace the film travels through multiple lives and meetings. Charles (Grant) falls for Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at first sight, but he's always been unwilling to make a commitment to marriage, and has had a series of girlfriends. He's met the right girl but doesn't have the ability to effectuate. Grant can play flustered, irresponsible, self-absorbed, irritated, bedraggled, put upon, and still keep his impish, boyish charm.
 The multiple weddings are fun with their eccentric characters. Grant and his friend say awkward, indiscreet, funny things in wedding speeches. One of the film's hilarious highlights is when Rowan Atkinson (of Mr. Bean fame) officiates at his first wedding as a newly ordained priest. He says ""Holy goat"" instead of ""Holy Ghost"" and ""Holy spigot"" instead of ""Holy Spirit.""
 The film's dialogue is literate and funny. It's clever the way Charles and Carrie use ""skulk"" for example. The film has great photography.
 At the final wedding suspense piles up, we in the audience get more involved and tense as the scene plays out. Stick around for the credits at the end: they're fun. And the soundtrack is fine too.",1263254400,,2307,4.875
591431,4,6303165680,"Classic comedy. All the supporting case is stellar. Except Andie MacDowell. She's not believable (is she really attractive enough to follow around at all these weddings?) and at this point in her career, she wasn't that good an actress. Or maybe this is her being good and in that case I just don't think she's all that and a bag of chips.

The funniest scene in my opinion is Hugh stuck in the pantry.

As for the DVD, I have the 1999 disc and it's as bare-bones as you can get (i.e., non ""Deluxe Edition""), although it does include a 'Collectible ""Making Of"" Booklet'--wow! Hopefully the extra bucks get you some extras? Mike Newell did a fantastic Director's Commentary for Donnie Brasco so here's hoping.

It's hard to believe that a romantic comedy was nominated for Best Picture (1994). Then again it seems like the Academy was big into nominating a British film almost every year in the 1990s.",1252281600,,900,4.647798742138365
591432,4,6303165680,This movie wasn't as good as I remembered in my youth.  It is one of the cute movies about a man who keeps meeting a mysterious woman at several weddings and a funeral.  Are they in love or not?  Are they just teasing each other?,1246147200,,229,4.044444444444444
591433,5,6303165680,"Okay so I watch this movie at least once a year. Its about a dorky English guy who sucks at meeting girls and is always late for weddings. Charles has a horribly shrill ex girlfriend his friends call duck face who carries a torch for him, and is even more pathetic at dating the opposite sex than he is.(If you can believe it) He thinks he is doomed to be single forever, until Charles falls in love with an American Girl wearing a Giant hat at his friend Angus's wedding.
You have to love his friends too. Sarcastic Fi, who seems like kinda of a cold bitch at first , but once you get to know her, you see what she is all about. Bernard and Lydia who have epic sexual chemistry. Gareth who wears loud vests and love to chicken dance.
It also captures the time in your life where everybody  is falling in love and getting married but you and all the cheesy dances and costumes and stuff.",1244332800,,887,4.2176470588235295
591434,4,6303165680,"FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, made on a pauper's budget, is one of those little British films of which no one was expecting much. Surprisingly, though, it became the little engine that could and garnered much acclaim from fans and critics and cashflow in the theaters. It even shot up to the number one slot in the American box office. This was Hugh Grant's breakthrough film, the one which catapulted him to A-list prominence as a top flight comedic leading man. It made him a star.

Thru the course of four weddings (and one devastating funeral), the movie chronicles the on-again, off-again romance of Charles, chronically tardy at weddings and commitment-phobic (his pals call him ""a serial monogamist""), and Carrie, the lovely independent American girl. I got so into this movie that it wasn't until at the end that I realized I didn't even know what these characters - and those in Charles's inner circle - did for a living, only that they seemed to be fairly well-off blokes and girls and a tight-knit, fun-loving bunch of pals. But most of the story does take place within the confines of the weddings (and that one funeral), because those are the only instances in which Charles and Carrie ever interact. But for one exception, that being a sequence in which Charles accidentally bumps into an engaged Carrie and she invites him to accompany her as she tries on different wedding gowns.

The screenplay is ridiculously good. And Mike Newell directs it, and I've always liked his stuff (ENCHANTED APRIL, INTO THE WEST, PUSHING TIN, and HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE). The romance is nice enough, with Charles almost bemusedly wooing the ravishing Andie MacDowell. Back in 1994, when this movie was released, Andie MacDowell was the biggest name on this roster. At that time in her career, she was doing big things, what with GREEN CARD and GROUNDHOG DAY having done well, and this film only served to garner her even more notice. But if I were to nitpick, it'll be to say that we never do get to know her character as well as we come to know Charles. Even by the end of the film, Carrie comes off as enigmatic. But the love story is only one slice of a very savory pie. There's big heart in this terrifically fleshed-out supporting cast, these actors pitch perfect in their parts and most capable of winning over the audience. However, some are more pitch perfect than others, and so I point out Simon Callow as the gregarious Gareth, John Hannah who delivers a magnificent reading of W.H. Auden's ""Funeral Blues,"" and Kristin Scott Thomas who underplays it as the acerbic and sad Fiona. Meanwhile, Rowan Atkinson is simply hilarious as the flustered new priest who gets a chance at conducting his first ever marriage ceremony (in which he breaks out ""the Holy Spigot!!"" Hah!). But all the actors involved here are wonderful, and that I'd actually feel a measure of sorrow when one of their characters abruptly passes away is a testament to this little film's ability to affect the audience. Charles and his crew, they seem like a great bunch of folks, even if they teeter towards posh.

But Hugh Grant owns this film. Hugh Grant wasn't really on Hollywood's radar before this picture, languishing as he was in forgettable made-for-TV films and overseas cinematic no-hopers. FOUR WEDDINGS is the film which, for the first time, showcased Hugh's comedic flair and impeccable timing. If you think he stammers and flutters those eyelids now, brother, he was a lot worse back in the day. But Hugh Grant oozes such charm and demonstrates such a quick and self-deprecating wit that the awkward habits somehow become disarming. For two samples of the man's dexterity with delivering convoluted lines, check out Charles's wedding toast and also his declaration of love for Carrie, with mad references to David Cassidy thrown in.

What I have is the Deluxe Edition DVD, which offers these special features: Filmmakers' audio commentary, which is okay and sometimes interesting, although, frankly, I would've preferred Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell's two cents (and anyone else's in the cast, for that matter); 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary by the producer (including more with Rowan Atkinson's novice priest); ""The Wedding Planners"" and ""FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL: In the Making"" are two behind-the-scenes featurettes; ""Two Actors and a Director"" is a 5 minute segment of interviews with Director Mike Newell and Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell; a Behind the Scenes photo gallery; promo spots (pretty funny, actually, with Hugh and Andie each getting a 30 second spot to promote the movie); and the theatrical trailer. Not bad.

I can't help but bring up Hugh Grant's later film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notting-Hill-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000023VTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notting Hill (Collector's Edition)</a>, and partly it's because it holds echoes of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL. Both films feature an out-of-his-league Englishman romancing an American beauty, although NOTTING HILL is decidedly more fairy tale. Both films have wonderful supporting actors and that tiny whiff of elegance, and both films will make you laugh but then do a one-eighty and make you sad and make you reflect. Oh, but then NOTTING HILL doesn't trot out characters with names like Duckface, Vomiting Veronica, and Miss Piggy. For whatever bragging rights that's worth.",1240358400,6,5422,5.094488188976378

Anyhow, Grant fears he will never find the one, the lightning bolt one. Each wedding, his entourage of single friends, old school chums and a vagrant mop head dutifully attend, always late, always a little worse for wear. Every funny disaster at these loaded affairs are reviewed, Grant stutters through the pratfalls. He continues this technique through Notting Hill and Love Actually. The man is now very rich.

591471,2,6303165680,"I've finally seen what people have said is the ""best modern romantic comedy"" around.  They're joking?  There might be that movie in this mess somewhere, but the script and editing kill it.
Charles (Hugh Grant) is a very attractive character and nicely written in his strengths (friendship, openness to the possibility of true love) and flaws (perpetually late, a complete lack of discretion).  Carrie (Andie MacDowell) is less engaging. For someone supposedly so ""experienced"" (she lists 33 lovers), she apparently has no idea what she's doing in her relationships.  She's attracted to Charles from the beginning but does absolutely nothing to encourage him other than invite him to have sex with her.  (If Charles is a ""serial monogamist"" then she's a ""serial monogamist"" who cheats.)  It makes one wonder how much is really there, how long before she's explaining to Charles that it just isn't working out, and there's this new guy who's now the one.  After all, according to the script as shown, they've barely talked to each other.
The script is much too obvious. There are real clunkers of forced scenes including one where it feels like someone said ""oh wait, we haven't made this person awful enough for what's about to happen to her so let's give her one really bitchy line.""  Charles's friends are a fascinating group, but only good acting prevents them from being cardboard stereotypes.
The film has no idea whether it's making meaningful statements about relationships or being a screwball farce.  It could have been cut either way.  As it is, it feels as deeply real and as cheaply funny as the unmoving waves in one backdrop.",1220227200,9,1638,4.945255474452555
591472,4,6303165680,"Highly regarded as one of the finest British comedies of all time, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' started off rather harsh (with perhaps 20 F-Bombs before another word was even spoken) and ended on the other side of sweet (awwww, they're kissing in the rain).  In the end, `Four Weddings...' works rather nicely, and while it's not the best British comedy in my opinion (I prefer screenwriter Richard Curtis' very own `Love Actually'), it is very enjoyable and worthy of most the love and accolades it has received.

The film revolves around a group of friends who discover love, friendship and life over the course of four weddings and a funeral (or should I say, `three weddings, a funeral and half a wedding' to be more precise).  At the center of this group is Charles, a bachelor who is afraid of commitment.  His commitment phobia seems to fade away when he meets the mysteriously elusive American, Carrie, at a wedding.  They have a moment and then she is gone and he can't stop thinking about her.  The remainder of the film follows Charles as he tries to reconnect with Carrie, obstacle after obstacle falling into his path.

I've read another review recently that mentioned how Andie MacDowell was perfectly cast as Carrie for the very fact that she is a boring actress, and her lack of natural charm made Charles interest in her all the more interesting.  I can agree.  I have never found MacDowell to be a particularly intriguing actress, that is for sure, but here she draws me in, mostly because I find myself trying to see what Charles sees in her.

The film is littered with wonderfully full performances, especially by Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas, but no one can really be singled out as `worst-in-show' since everyone involved rises to the occasion and hands the audience a wonderful experience.  Grant though, should be singled out as `best-in-show' for he really personifies what he has been trying to personify since he first appeared on the big screen.  Some actors are always given a hard time for constantly playing variations of the same character.  Some do so wonderfully, others not so wonderfully.  Grant has made a career of, rather wonderfully, playing the commitment phoebe that unintentionally pushes everyone away with his arrogance.  Charles is the perfect example of this character because Grant has softened him to the point where his arrogance is an understatement and his gentle nature is his major selling point.  I am still baffled at the fact that Grant has yet to receive an Academy Award nomination, for he is constantly effortless in his roles and typically stands out in every film he inhabits as `best-in-show'.  Kristen Scott Thomas is also edible as Fiona, capturing the comedy within the script effortlessly, and inhabiting her character with real warmth and genuine heart.  Her secret desires for Charles help create a three dimensional character who is both easy to love and easy to understand.

It must be said that Richard Curtis knows how to pen a winning comedy.  His style of wit and poignancy help elevate `Four Weddings and a Funeral' from a generic romantic comedy to something much deeper and ultimately much more memorable.  He has a knack for giving his characters something to sink their teeth into, something to really embellish and deliver to the audience.  He creates characters that we can feel connected to, and we truly feel connected to the ones presented us in `Four Weddings...'.

In the end `Four Weddings and a Funeral' is a feel good romantic comedy that hits almost every mark and delivers a beautifully fulfilling cinematic experience.  It has its faults, sure, and it misses the mark in some areas, but not every film is aimed at perfection.  What every film is aimed at though is entertainment, and `Four Weddings and a Funeral' definitely entertains.",1219622400,2,3837,4.8842592592592595

591476,3,6303165680,"Mike Newell's stylish 1994 hit, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", expertly fulfills the traditional criteria of romantic comedy, the most important one being that unlike in real life, (almost) everyone finds love with the right person - a conclusion never really in doubt, so this piece of information won't spoil anything.  A fine cast that includes Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow, and John Hannah lends sparkle and charm to this tale of a group of long-time friends who, one by one, are crossing from carefree, single blessedness into the marital state.  Except for one: Charles (Hugh Grant), who just can't seem to get himself over that line, despite successive relationships with attractive women who all want to hook him.

Charles and his friends apparently occupy some blissful realm where little matters such as jobs and careers don't seem to exist.  Two (Phoebe and her brother Tom) are obviously wealthy aristocrats, but it's a mystery how the others support themselves as they float around, showing up at one wedding after another and co-mingling at receptions with a clearly upper-class crowd in which all the women wear large expensive hats.  All the same guests appear to show up at all the weddings.

I'm not a great fan of Hugh Grant, whose lip-biting, stammering, hair-pushing mannerisms drive me up the wall.  However, the role of the emotionally infantile and graceless Charles suits Grant almost too well, so it's hard to complain.  As the film opens, Charles and his elfin roommate, Scarlett (a wonderfully eccentric portrayal by the unfortunately deceased Charlotte Coleman), are off to the film's first wedding, where Charles, as usual, is the perennial Best Man.  Already troubled by his inability to commit, at the reception Charles meets a pretty American, Carrie, played by the mind-bogglingly talentless Andie MacDowell, whose casting is the only major flaw in this film.  MacDowell could give Tippi Hedren a run for the ""Least Talented Actress Ever To Have A Career In Films"" award, and for the same reason: a hopelessly flat persona, voice, and delivery.  This defect is particularly glaring amongst this group of fine British actors.  MacDowell's flat delivery, devoid of nuance, imagination, color, or shading of any kind, turns her lines into the dramatic equivalent of Wonder Bread.  It's a shame someone on the level of the rest of the cast couldn't be found for this role.

At any rate, although Charles doesn't figure it out for some time (although, of course, the audience does), Carrie is the Thunderbolt that has finally hit him.  For the rest of the film, we wait for Charles to acknowledge what everyone around him sees clearly, and, as we wait, we are treated to three more weddings and that funeral.  The second wedding contains a priceless turn by Britain's famed comedian, Rowan Atkinson, as a priest nervously performing his first marriage, and mangling the language of the wedding service as he does so.

The movie is also notable for including a happy gay couple (John Hannah and Simon Callow), without qualification or discussion.  Callow, one of Britain's most distinguished stage and screen actors, gets to chew up the scenery a bit, while sharp-eyed devotees of BBC's ""Wire in the Blood"" and ""MI-5"" series's may spot a young Nicola Walker, later one of the lead detectives in ""Wire"" and an operative on ""MI-5"", as one of the maddening folk singers (""Can't live/without yuuuuuuuuu. . ."") at the second wedding.

The outcome of the story is never really in doubt; as is often said, it's the journey, not the arrival, that counts.  In this case, it's the wit and stylish performances (with the exception of MacDowell) that make this journey enjoyable - not to mention critiquing those varied wedding dresses, church settings, flower arrangements, etc.  The traditions of romantic comedy make it easy to ignore such minor questions as, ""When do these people work?  What do they DO?!"".

Nothing if not charming, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" goes down easy and raises many smiles.",1213833600,8,4028,5.033132530120482

591478,5,6303165680,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" (1994) a British romantic comedy/drama, caused something of a sensation upon its release.  It broke all records for worldwide box-office take by a British picture: and not very many British pictures since have done as well.  It was received rapturously by many important critics, and was nominated for a ""Best Picture"" Academy Award.  It boosted the careers of its director, Mike Newell, and most of its talented cast members.  It also made its star, Hugh Grant, flavor of the decade - and counting -- as leading man of any English-speaking romantic comedy.  It put its author, Richard Curtis, at the head of what has since become an English cottage industry, the creation of romantic Brit-coms (see ""Notting Hill,""""Love Actually,""etc.)  Yet, when it was made, the budget was so tight that those glorious Scottish wedding scenes were all filmed in Hampshire, a Home County near London.  And the numerous wedding scene extras were required to wear their own evening dress.

Most everyone knows the plot, but here goes. Charles (Grant) is one of a group of young friends looking unsuccessfully, it seems, for love.  Charles is commitment-phobic; yet he, his roommate, Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman), and the crowd seem to spend every Saturday going, late, to weddings, where they are frequently members of the wedding parties.  Disastrous best man speeches are made, rings are forgotten.  Then Charles spots the beautiful American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at a wedding, and much yearning ensues.  Carrie announces her engagement to, and marries, a rich, older Scot, Hamish (Corin Redgrave).  But, of course, true love triumphs and triumphs and triumphs.  There are viewers that consider MacDowell's performance too passive, but everyone agrees Grant created the perfect romantic English lead, shy, stuttering, hair in his eyes.  Coleman, who unfortunately died much too young, in an asthma attack, made Scarlett touching and real.  Redgrave, well, of course.

The supporting cast was also uniformly excellent, and funny.  Rowan Atkinson is hilarious in a small part as Father Gerald, priest in training.  James Fleet does good work as Tom, the crowd's millionaire.  Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful, beautifully-dressed, witty, touching and intelligent as Tom's sister Fiona, who's unfortunate enough to love Charles.  Theater stalwart Simon Callow shines as the gay Gareth; and, as for John Hannah, playing his lover Matthew; well, it's all been said, hasn't it.  Though I'd add that I never yet have re watched this movie -- did so again last night--without being reduced to tears by his reading of WH Auden's ""Funeral Blues"" poem at Gareth's untimely funeral.

If you love the movie, the Deluxe Edition is useful.  Its extras are very helpful: Audio Commentary with filmmakers, ""Wedding Planners"" Documentary, ""Two Actors and a Director"" featurette, and the featurette on the making of the film.  The deleted scenes are uniformly funny, too, and give us a bit more back-story of the characters, which the movie doesn't give us a lot of.",1205798400,10,3067,5.222903885480573

591500,2,6303165680,"Given the many accolades assigned to this film over the years (not the least of which are Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Oscar Nominations), I was expecting a classic, top-tier romantic comedy on the order of When Harry Met Sally.  Unfortunately, Four Weddings and a Funeral fell well short of those lofty expectations.

The sad part is that the film does a great many things well.  The movie has many funny moments and the ensemble cast is mostly exceptional, especially amongst Charles' highly eclectic group of friends.  However, it suffers from one fatal flaw: the female lead is terrible.

Andie MacDowell's Carrie has all the charisma of a piece of upholstery (and a cheap one, at that).  A combination of a poor performance and a poorly fleshed out character arc combine to make her perhaps one of the least interesting cinematic romantic interests of all time.  There is very little chemistry between she and Hugh Grant, nor is any indication really given of what attracts Charles to her outside of the fact that she owns a nice hat and is a demon in the sack.  She has one good line after the first time she and Charles get busy, and that essentially ends her contribution to the film.

While entertaining in parts, the lack of an even adequate female lead (both a function of the actress and the script) kills this highly overrated film.

Also this particular iteration of the DVD is terrible.  It is a dual-layered disc, with the widescreen edition on one side and the fullscreen on the other.  However the ""widescreen"" edition is shown letterboxed... on my widescreen labtop it still displays at a 4:3 ratio with letterbox bars, unnecessarily shrinking the image.  Also, someone at the studio apparently thought it would be a good idea to have English and French audio options, but subtitles available only in Spanish.  If you are a fan of the film, you're probably better off going with the 2006 Deluxe Edition.",1201219200,3,1935,4.806646525679758

Charles meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at wedding number one and a good portion of the movie revolves around whether these two will end up together or not. There are various subplots involving four of his friends as well as his brother, most of them involving romance of some sort.

This is the movie that made Hugh Grant a star and it's easy to see why. He plays his stuttering nice guy to perfection and is helped by a script that any actor would gladly kill for. Andie MacDowell plays a terrific counterbalance with her mellow charm. The entire cast of largely unknown (in the U.S. at least) British actors does a fantastic job of infusing the film with warmth and life. Another plus is that this is the rare movie where the cast looks like real people instead of supermodels. It helps ground the film and make the characters seem more real.

This deluxe edition DVD is a nice presentation. The picture has been cleaned up and converted to anamorphic format, the sound is crisp and there are some nice ""making of"" documentaries.

591504,4,6303165680,"Charles (Hugh Grant) is what some people would call a player.  He has had numerous relationships, but commitment is not in his vocabulary.  Charles's fear of commitment suffers a challenge when he meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell).  Carrie is intelligent, mysterious and honest, and is very self-confident and care-free.  Charles struggles against his feelings as he finds himself falling in love with Carrie, but not wanting to speak those words aloud.

This movie is humorous from beginning to end.  Sometimes the humor is worthy of a laugh, but much of the humor just made me smile.  Regardless of whether I was smiling or laughing, I was completely involved in the story and I wanted Charles and Carrie to end up with each other.  There are four weddings, and a sad funeral, but each wedding and the funeral provide opportunities for an array of jokes and gags.

I only have one complaint about this movie.  There is significant use of four-letter words throughout.  Unfortunately, one portion of the movie benefits from the language so eliminating it would also eliminate some of the humor, but there are places where the language was unnecessary.  Obviously this movie is more suitable for an older audience.  I would probably avoid showing the DVD version to anyone younger than 16 or 17 years old because of the language.

I have seen comments about Hugh Grant and his ""mumbling.""  I guess I have a different definition of mumbling.  I thought Grant spoke his lines about as clearly as I talk (maybe I mumble), and other than brief moments where he was being introspective - let's face it, people may mumble when they are thinking out loud - Grant does not mumble.

I am also impressed that Hugh Grant somehow said four-letter words and left a string of girl friends behind him, and yet he still looked sweet and innocent.  I guess that was why he was able to get another girl friend each time he dumped the last one.

Andie MacDowell is beautiful and expressive and perfect for this role.  She is sexy and mysterious and intelligent and sensitive, sometimes all at once.  I could readily see why Charles was smitten by Carrie.  As with most characters Andie MacDowell plays, she brings elegant and classy Carrie to life.

This movie was good enough to gain two Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture and Best Screenplay.  Beyond those nominations, the movie won 23 significant awards, such as the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Picture in 1994.  The movie was nominated for another 14 awards of varying stature.

""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is a rare light romantic comedy that relies on an unusual combination of subtle and blatant humor in combination with an intelligent plot.  I wondered whether Charles had a hope of capturing the heart of beautiful Carrie to the end of the movie, even as I was smiling and laughing at the humor.  If you enjoy light romantic comedies, Hugh Grant or Andie MacDowell, you will find this award-winning movie to be worth more than one watch.

The infatuated if commitment-phobic Charles stands in wide-eyed shock, even as he tries to handle what he is hearing with good-natured cheer, but just watching Charles as he forces his mouth not to fall open makes for an endearingly hilarious moment. (Hey, guys, if you didn't wanna know, why'd you ask? Right, girls?) There's also a show-stealing bit wherein Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean, himself, plays a nervously virginal vicar fumblingly presiding at one of the promised ""four weddings"" of the film. Really there are too many excellent performances here among British veterans of stage and screen---Simon Callow, Kristin Scott Thomas, Mike Newell, everyone it sometimes seems except a conspicuously absent Helena Bonham Carter---for this to be anything but a delight to own and watch again and again.

Hugh Grant does his whole mumbling routine (which you either love or you hate - I happen to dig it) and the supporting cast is simply brilliant. Andie McDowell's place in this movie is something of a mystery. I don't know if her casting was genius or just grabbing any American actress who had name recognition. Her character should come off as, well, a bit of a whore but Andie couldn't play such a role if her life depended on it. She's just too nice. I think her playing the role may have saved it, though. Any other actress may have come off much less likable in the end.

One of the only negative things I can say about this movie, and Richard Curtis, is that the gay people aren't written well. The gays are gay in name only, they just come of as flamboyant asexuals. Granted the movie is 12+ years old, but still...

I am not a fan of romantic comedies at all (save for ""French Kiss,"" this movie and ""Love Actually"") so I was very pleasantly surprised with this flick.",1167091200,2,1145,4.442857142857143

Then there is the plot of Four Weddings and a Funeral.  Hugh Grant's character, along with all of his friends, have no life other than bumbling along at weddings and funerals.  It seems that Grant's ""profession"" is trying to have a constant stream of sleeping partners.

591542,5,6303165680,"The 1994 movie, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", was an international box office hit and the pioneer in the film genre known as the 'Romantic Brit-Com'. This is a genre of usually small budget, comedic films, that are about the romantic lives of good looking, young Brits (usually with a close group of witty, quirky, supportive friends), who must overcome self-doubt and bad timing to make true love happen. A good number of these films star British actor, Hugh Grant and have been written (and sometimes directed) by Richard Curtis (""Notting Hill"" ""Love Actually,"" ""Bridget Jones""). Curtis has been so involved in this genre, that he's basically been annoited ""King of the Romantic Brit-Coms"". ""Four Weddings"" was pretty much the first of these films. This movie mostly takes place at public events, which are of course the ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" in the title. In the film we meet Charles (Hugh Grant) and his close knit group of quirky, witty, supportive friends. We never find out what they do for a living, what their backgrounds are and only get hints of how they know each other. It's as though we are guests at a wedding meeting these people for the first time. What we do find out is that Charles seems to be a perennial wedding guest/Best-Man. He has great doubts about his troubled romantic life and wonders if he is ever destined to meet, that one special person, who he might actually marry. He also always seems to be putting his foot in his mouth and getting into embarassing comic situations (I love the scene, where he gets stuck at a table filled with all his ex-girlfriends!) At the first wedding he meets a glamorous American named, Carrie (played by a luminous, Andie MacDowell). They meet, flirt, even wind up in bed with each other over the course of the different public occasions. But of course because of self-doubt and bad timing, these characters can never really seem to get it together and declare their true love for each other. It's not hard to figure out how this all ends, but the long and winding road over the course of the four weddings and a funeral are quite funny, sad and interesting for all. This is due to the  very funny and poignant script from Richard Curtis and sure direction from Mike Newell. The cast is top notch. Hugh Grant has a star making performance in the lead role. Other standout performances include actors Simon Callow as the gregarious, full of life, Gareth and John Hannah as Matthew, who just stops the film with an emotion filled eulogy. Kristin Scott Thomas is also very good as Charles' friend Fiona, who secretly pines for him. Finally, mention should be of British Comedian, Rowan Atkinson's short, but drop dead hilarious turn, as a very nervous, new Vicar, who can't seem to get the wedding vows right! (""Do you take Lydia Jane Hibbert to be your Awful wedded wife!"") Originally, this film was released in a pretty primitive bare bones release. It has now been released in a newly minted, 'Deluxe Edition'. The picture is cleaned up and presented in widescreen. I thought the sound in this edition left a lot to be desired. The extras are wonderful. They include a full length commentary track from the filmmakers and a number of short documentaries and featurettes on the making of the film, that prove to be very interesting.

The extras make this a much better product than the bare-bones DVD that has been on the market for years.

Still, I found the ""making-of"" documentaries slightly arrogant and self-congratulatory.  The film snippets used in the featurettes were sped-up such that the characters' voices sounded noticably off-pitch.  The deleted scenes were quite short (almost blurbs, really) and did nothing to illuminate the film.

Most distressing, however, was the lack of care that went into the film's transfer to this DVD.  Both picture quality and audio were sorely lacking.  The screen was marked throughout with dust spots and blemishes that drew my eye away from the action, making this DVD picture slightly worse than the VHS copy I've been using for 10 years.  Moreover, absolutely nothing was done to improve the audio.  Some parts - including the opening song ""But Not for Me"" - actually sounded worse than on VHS.

591576,3,6303165680,"After the death of Charlotte Coleman, who played the wonderfully eccentric Scarlett in this movie, it seems appropriate to watch this movie purely for her. She did a lot of different TV stuff, this was really one of her only films, and she steals the show from bigger stars such as Hugh Grant.

You know there's going to be a sad moment in this film, when there's ""funeral"" in the title, and it's the best moment in the entire film, it works, and it's so sad at the same time. John Hannah is also excellent in this film, and is not overly camp, despite what other reviewers may think.

I really don't like many of the characters in this, but seem to enjoy the film for some strange reason. I mainly hate Hugh Grant's & Kristin Scott Thomas's characters, and Andie McDowell's character is just a pain in the neck. This woman cannot act, even in those Loreal adverts that she does. Her lines are delivered in a monotone voice, with no emotion whatsoever. Rowan Atkinson as the nervous first time priest, is an absolute hoot, complete with messing up his lines (""awful wedded wife"", or ""holy goat"" for ""holy ghost""), being unable to say the bride & groom's name, and generally just being his funny self.

One of the best scenes in the whole movie, is when Hugh's character is at a table at a wedding - surrounded by 3 or 4 of his exes. This scene is set up for utter humiliation, and it's hilarious to watch it unfold.

If you hate typically stereotyped English characters, complete with plummy irritating accents, then don't watch this film. If you're easily irritated by Hugh Grant (yes, I normally am, until I saw Bridget Jones Diary), then this is not the film. It's not a film you watch too many times however.

Well - actually - the movie itself too - as I had to come here to read how the characters are related - or not - to each other as it wasn't explained clearly in the movie. Or maybe it *Was* explained and I just didn't catch it, which brings up my other issue: there are subtitles provided in Spanish and French, but NOT English.  Now, I was born and have spent my entire life in ""the Heartland"" of the USA - from Canada to Texas.  British English, to me, is a 4th language, for which I do not have an ""ear.""

The singletons are all secretly on the lookout for the person with whom to finally share their own vows. Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas) is stoically in love with Charlie (Hugh Grant) throughout the film, although it is clear from the start he is meant to be with Carrie (Andie Macdowell) even if he doesn't follow-up with her after their one-night stand and even if their chemistry seems a bit questionable. I find Macdowell cute and pretty and sometimes witty, but rarely sexy.

The wedding bits are usually hysterically funny especially with Rowan Atkinson as the priest, but it's the funeral scene that always compels me to watch this again.

It's a look at life among the British hipper class, and many of the gags really happened to the screenwriter at actual weddings.

Romantic connections are made, lost, and rediscovered amongst the guests at the weddings plus a tragic funeral.  These entanglements are buoyed by a funny, observant screenplay which includes references to David Cassidy and the Partridge Family as well as an hilarious stretch in which a nervous novice minister adds a new twist to the nuptials by referring to the bride-to-be as an ""AWFUL wedded wife"" or by concluding the rituals ""in the name of the father, son, and holy GOAT"". Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean plays the bumbling minister to side-splitting perfection.

This is the movie that elevated Hugh Grant to major stardom and familiarized American audiences with a strikingly beautiful,  gifted young actress named Kristin Scott Thomas.

591597,4,6303165680,"Never have I been so impressed with a film as I was with Mike Newell's British romp, Four Weddings and a Funeral.  I can honestly say that this was one of those films that needed to have strong definitive characters to make the story work, and Newell accomplished this task with the greatest of ease.  While he had done some work prior to this film, America was introduced to a very funny and very British Hugh Grant for the first time.  His amazing and singular work in this film skyrocketed him to his level in Hollywood today.  He could not have found a better step ladder.

This film is funny, insightful, witty, and very personable.  It is hard to find films of this caliber created by Hollywood anymore, so thankfully we have this film.  Everything from the soundtrack (boasting several American songs), to the deeply humorous and intuitive references to American ""pop"" culture, to Hugh Grant's use of a certain word time over time, only keeps this film above all others.  This is definitely one of those films that should be watched when life seems to be dragging and you need a bowl of laughter in your life.  It should also be used by anyone that is a fan of British humor.  It will turn any day into sunshine.

Overall, this was a surprising film when I watched it for the first time, and it continues to impress.  I am not a huge fan of Andie MacDowell, so it sometimes perplexes me as to why she chose this project, but thankfully this is counteracted by one of Hollywood's most classic scenes involving Rowan Atkinson!  That man can do no wrong!  I suggest this film to everyone at least once.  It may not be everyone's ""cup of tea"", but watching it once caused nobody harm.

591598,4,6303165680,"This is definitely a film that can be watched over and over again, with a very talented cast of British actors.  James Fleet's Tom actually elicits more laughs from me than Hugh Grant's Charles.  Andie Macdowell has definitely earned the enmity of fans of this British comedy everywhere for the apparent coldness of her character (""Hey, aren't the English supposed to be the cold fish?"").  But Carrie, I believe, is the kind of woman who would sleep with another and still manage to mercilessly seduce and befriend everyone in her way.

The movie, as a now cult hit, is curious in some ways.  The film never explicitly states what Charles' job is. But there are two clues which should not be ignored.  It seems that he is a writer or scholar of some sort, who deals with word origins and etymologies. 1) When he asks Tom to stop the car after the first wedding, he claims he wants to go to the inn ""The Lucky Boatman"" because ""he is looking at English inns or pubs that have 'boat' in their title"" (not an exact quote). 2) The second clue is given during the -ahem- amorous scene between Charles and Carrie that same night. Andie Macdowell asks Charles where he thinks the word ""honeymoon"" comes from, and he replies that it's honey because it's sweet, and moon because that would be the first time a husband would see his wife's bottom.

As for the other characters, Tom and Fiona are of course landed gentry (notice the Farmer's Weekly magazine on Tom's little table when he wakes up in the morning in the first scenes of the movie). Scarlett says she's after a job as a sales assistant at a place called ""Spank"" that sells rubber products (this is when Charles gets the invitation to Carrie's wedding). I have no clue as to what Gareth or Matthew do, but perhaps they are academics, although Gareth's funeral takes place near a factory.

I've always wondered what appointment Charles makes his brother David miss while Carrie is recounting her sexual experiences in the caf.  The building in the film does not look like a hospital or a bank.

Previous reviewers state that Charles and Scarlett are siblings.  No indication of this is given in the movie; they are simply ""flatmates.""  But Charles and David are of course brothers, and Charles refers to his father's funeral more than once.",1092614400,,2291,4.643564356435643

591600,1,6303165680,"***SPOILERS UNAVOIDABLE***

If you're a budding Anglophile then you're liable to fall for this charmless and, quite frankly, mean-spirited film.  A gang of smug friends habitually attends weddings (which they despise) of other friends (to whom they seem indifferent).  Each of the smug friends - apart from two of the men, who are a couple - is single because either their lovers have left them or they themselves are indecisive.  The male-male couple seems genuinely happy together, but they, like their smug friends, cannot refrain from relentless mockery of the weddings no one forces them to attend.  But even the married couples are prompted to wed out of a desperate fear of being alone.  It's all very cynical.

And the principal romance is disastrously mishandled.  The hero (Hugh Grant) is a perfect specimen of repugnant insipidity.  The heroine (Andie MacDowell) is a sinister mannequin with nymphomaniacal pretensions.  Likes repel in accordance with the laws of attraction.  In Four Weddings and a Funeral, which boasts a screenplay that should have failed an undergraduate workshop, these two grotesques find each other irresistible.  Several inevitable tragedies arise, most notably the death of one of the men of the male-male couple.  (But he ate pans of sausages for breakfast and was unpleasant to nearly everyone except his boyfriend.  So for me his heart attack was well-deserved.)  This forces what's left of the smug gang to re-examine their smugness and, in a shocking adherence to the law of opposites attracting, they slowly pair off with other friends about whom they had previously been smug.  As for the hero and the heroine, while they are busy not being repulsed by each other it transpires that the heroine is already pre-contracted to another grotesque, whom she marries.  Everlasting loneliness looms over the head of the hero.  So he decides to marry a grotesque whom he had previously jilted.  But before the hero can vow to never again know the pleasure of a single moment's solitude, the heroine arrives to tell him that the grotesque she married was somehow too gruesome for her liking and that she is once more free to not be repulsed by the hero.  Naturally the hero does the right thing and rejects his grotesque bride before witnesses.  By now the twice-jilted grotesque is justified in opening the hero's throat but rather civilly punches him in the face.  Anxieties ensue for the hero but are all for nowt when the heroine reappears agreeing to compromise with him on ""not being married.""  They bring their lips together in the rain and thereby provoke a thunderclap straight out of Rocky Horror Picture Show, a far superior film for which this surely must have been a sequel that lost its way.

Absent any other merit this film does have the purely anthropological/sociological value of being set in the early '90s.  So if you find it worth your while to be relentlessly assaulted by women wearing appalling dresses with inflated shoulders and men sporting more than usually floppy haircuts then Four Weddings and a Funeral will be momentarily distracting at best.

Otherwise you're better off reading Jane Austen or watching an RSC production.",1089590400,11,3190,5.0285714285714285

591602,3,6303165680,"I had heard so many good things about this film that when I finally saw it, I was surprised to find it so very disappointing. The story revolves a group of people who constantly find themselves at weddings, and yet they themselves never get married. At one wedding Charles (Hugh Grant) is entranced by an American woman, Carrie (Andie MacDowell). Upon finding that they are staying at the same hotel, they end up in bed together. The following day Carrie returns to the States, leaving Charles forlorn and alone. A few months later Carrie turns up at another wedding, announcing that she's engaged to someone else. Nevertheless, she and Charles hop in the sack once more. Carrie then proceeds to marry her fiance, and Charles continues to pine for her, wondering if perhaps he should settle for any ordinary woman rather than wait for the perfect one.
The entire plotline is rather shaky to begin with, though it could have been done well, with some tweaking. But the main problem is that the romance between Charles and Carrie just seems utterly unrealistic. They meet for the first time, barely speak two words to each other before sleeping together, and Carrie promtly leaves the next morning, and yet Charles is madly in love with her. Why? They have nothing in common, know nothing about each other, and have known each other for one day. Carrie's idea of conversation is detailing the bedroom talents of each of her 33 lovers. And she sleeps with one man while engaged to another!
The movie is further dragged down by the fact that there is not a whit of chemistry between Grant and MacDowell. As I watched them, I felt... nothing. Not boredom or disdain, but just a big flat resounding nothing. Grant acted very well, and MacDowell did a passable job with a less-than-ideal role, but the two just don't work together. I know Grant can do a great romantic comedy - I've seen plenty of his other movies - but MacDowell is clearly not a good match.
The rest of the cast was fairly good. In fact, I enjoyed the numerous sideline romances far more than the central one. There are many funny moments (though a couple of the jokes fall horribly flat), and even a couple touching ones, just not between the main characters where they should have been. I liked many of the other characters, and found myself rooting for their romantic success rather than Charles and Carrie's. They actually interact with each other, whereas the relationship between Carrie and Charles seems to be based only on the fact that they've slept together. The movie wasn't an entire waste, and connoisseurs of Hugh Grant should see it, but it's not one I myself would watch again. I'd recommend it as a rental only.",1082592000,13,2690,4.701271186440678

but leave the damaging factor to the american heroine.  i'm an american, but i just could not and would not identify with andie mcdowell's character.  she kept trying to give that mysterious elusive quality to the character and just utterly failed.  rather than seeming elusive and aloof, she seemed more like a tease that just wasn't worth it.
don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of romantic comedies, but that also means that i like my romantic comedies to be perfectly executed.  the casting diretor failed miserably when casting andie mcdowell.  either that or the screenwriter just didn't want to be nice to his heroine.  but then, i really think andie's character could have been much more sympathetic if a different actress had played it - maybe even julia roberts, even when i'm not exactly a fan.  i mean, how could a casting director think that viewers would find andie's character more desirable than that of kristin scott thomas (i forget the characters' names).  i was honestly smacking myself in the forehead crying, why, charles why?

591604,5,6303165680,"I frequently watch Four Weddings because it's a marvelously funny and classy movie. Several years ago I would never have believed that Hugh Grant could be a serious actor, but now I regard him as an excellent comedic actor, something like Cary Grant. His persona is similar to Cary Grant's: the handsome, appealing, but socially bungling playboy never-do-well. I love this persona, and I'm reminded of Cary Grant's movies with Irene Dunne. They are so hilarious because Dunne has a razor sharp wit and can put Grant in his place with her retorts.

The cast of actors in Foour Weddngs is interesting because you have the upper class,the middle class, the intellectual, and the lower class represented. They don't mind mingling with each other, and they genuinely love one another. Hugh's lines are always funny, especially at the first reception. Another great moment of comedy is at the reception of Bernard's wedding when Hugh Grant is seated with old flames, and his indiscretions are brought up at the table by these former flames.

Four Weddings is very balanced because there is a thread of sadness about the oneliness of the characters' not being married coarsing through the film, especially Hugh's character. Also, the death of the ebullient Garret, provides a wonderful foil to what might have become a silly film. Kristen's character is also sad because she never finds her love because she loves Hugh Grant's character. I wish that they would have fallen in love, instead of Andie McDowell's character.

The film's music score is gorgeous, also. Richard Rodney Bennett composed the music to Yanks, with Richard Gere and Lisa Eichorn. William Devane, and Vanessa Redgrave. Yanks is a great romantic movie. I highly recommend it, even if you don't think Gere a good actor.

I frequently watch Four Weddings, and I heartily recommend it those who haven't viewed it or to those who need a romantic facelift.

591627,5,6303165680,"Rowan Atkinson, who plays the nervous and shy Father Gerald, speaks those lines at a wedding.  His writing partner, Richard Curtis, wrote this sweet, good-natured comedy of a circle of friends, all in their thirties, who attend weddings and gradually wonder the mysteries of love.  Is it better to hold out for that ideal person or as the bumbling, nice, but not exactly fashion-modellish Tom puts it, ""I always just hoped that, that I'd meet some nice friendly girl, like the look of her, hope the look of me didn't make her physically sick, then pop the question and, um, settle down and be happy.""  The follies of finding anyone just to prevent from being lonely is also explored here, but so is the chain reaction that occurs at weddings, i.e. other people in turn end up getting married in serendipitous circumstances.
The opening scenes to the first marriage of the various friends getting ready, set to an Elton John song, sets the stage for the story.  The scenes of the slow-rising Charles and his female roommate Scarlett result in a series of comical scenes that elicit the f-word from them both, including missing the offramp leading to the wedding site.
It's at the first wedding that Cupid launches a projectile at Charles (Hugh Grant) via Carrie (Andie McDowell), an American who appears at the wedding with a big black hat.  What might have been a missed opportunity later turns depressing for Charles when he finds out she's engaged.  Indeed, he has a history of ex-girlfriends that leads the sensitive Henrietta to call him a serial monogamist.  But Charles is bewildered with awe at people who are actually ready to take that lifelong committment.  After all, despite divorce being commonplace, the sanctity of wedding still carries importance.  Both Grant's goofy and McDowell's sweet and lovable performances lift this film up, with the latter's winning smile, but they're not the only ones.
Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas), nicknamed Fi or even Fifi, has a dignified beauty colored by a cynical tongue.  In the first wedding, when Scarlett gushes over the bride, she says, ""Scarlett, you're blind.  She looks like a big meringue.""  She also unleashes her tart tongue at meek Father Gerald, training to be a priest.  She says it's rather like the first time one has sex, ""a lot less messy of course, and far less call for condoms.""  Gerald titters with nervous laughter.
Of the other characters, Gareth, played by Simon Callow, is flamboyant, simply jovial, full of life, a true romantic, someone it's fun to hang around and be merry with, and as we learn later, a culinary eccentric.  Seeing him cutting loose on the dance floor in the first wedding is a highlight.  He plays with the theory that marriage is the last gasp between two couples who have run out of things to say, then says that true love is the driving force behind marriage.
The pint-sized Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) is another funny character.  She has a shock of short bright red hair, sings offkey at church, and gets flirty with strangers at weddings.  It was quite a shock when I heard of her death from an asthma attack last year.
And David, Charles's deaf brother who's quite a dish, also gains some laughs in the conversations he has with his brother, and also with a girl who fancies him enough to take sign language lessons.  Is that love or what?
Another bit of trivia.  According to Richard Curtis, Henrietta's nickname was toned down to Duckface for propriety.  Guess what it was originally going to be?  Hint:  Duck gets replaced by a word it rhymes with.  And for those who don't know, the poem read at the funeral is W.H. Auden's ""Funeral Blues"".
With winning performances all around, great lines, be they witty, acerbic, or poignant, Four Weddings And A Funeral is a funny, romantic, and heartwarming winner from director Mike Newell (Enchanted April, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire [pending]).

The story is a let down and a bit of a stretch. While none of the characters were fully developed, I found myself despising Andie McDowall's character and couldn't understand why Hugh Grant was so infatuated by her. Their entire romance consisted of run-ins at weddings and funerals, two of which were their own--it doesn't quite add up! Characters come and go way too fast and I had troubled telling most of them apart.  Way too many characters, far more interesting than Grant and McDowall put together, are unfortunately wasted here, so the film can concentrate on the implausible romance between the British womanizer and his American love interest.

The film centres around the character of Charles, played by Hugh Grant, who sees his friends getting married (and in one case dying) which causes him to think about his own relationships and what the future has in store for him, while all the time making witty (and sometimes silly) comments on his friends' actions.
While Grant is undoubtedly the star, this is to some extent an ensemble piece and there are delightful performances from John Hannah and Simon Callow in particular. Watch out for the late Charlotte Coleman as well. Andie MacDowell is the American here, yet does not seem at all out of place in the curious world of eccentricity, class, and tomfoolery into which she is thrown (I can say this, I am English!).
The script is just brilliant, by Blackadder/Vicar Of Dibley  writer Richard Curtis, and is another element that makes you want to watch the film again and again.
Finally, the film has one great thing to recommend it, and that is a sympathetic deaf character who does not appear to have been put in the film solely because of his disability, and who is served well by a script that neither patronises nor ignores his deafness.",1053302400,4,1389,4.490118577075099

Funeral Blues
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last for ever; I was wrong.

Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;

591634,3,6303165680,"Four Weddings and a Funeral is an extremely funny film.  If the opening sequence doesn't make you laugh, nothing will.  And conversely, if Matthew's moving rendition of W. H. Auden's ""Stop all the clocks. . ."" poem doesn't leave you close to tears, then you must be truly hard-hearted.  Unfortunately though, what could have been an excellent comedy has a major flaw.
Charles (Hugh Grant) is a likeable chap whose friends are all getting married, leaving him as a sort of perpetual Best Man.  Then American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) enters the picture and causes Charles to reassess his thoughts on marriage.  Grant has charisma in spades, but sadly MacDowell does not.  In fact, she is perhaps one of the least charismatic actresses ever.  Not only that, but the limit of her acting ability seems to be a toothpaste-advertisement-style smile.  Fortunately the casting of Charles's motley collection of single friends is excellent, and one can't help thinking he would be better off marrying one of them.
The film is almost fly-on-the-wall in its style, which gives it realism and allows it to explore the relationships within the group of friends on an intimate and everyday level.  Hence the subtle humour works better than, for example, Rowan Atkinson's very obvious laugh-line attempts as a preacher with a penchant for Spoonerisms.
As one character notes, weddings have a habit of blending together in the memory and the director has played on this, creating four weddings that are visually similar and yet distinct.  And of one of them is particularly memorable for the fact that it doesn't actually include a marriage ceremony.  At its conclusion the film shows that whilst marriage is a noble institution, it is not for everybody.",1043020800,4,1737,5.038461538461538

591636,4,6303165680,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is one of the few romantic comedies I appreciate.  It's a lovable, hilarious look at the wackiness of love and weddings.  Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant are fine leads, though MacDowell's character is written rather weakly.  There really isn't much for her to do, except perform the duties of ""unrequited love interest"".  The other characters are very vivid, though.  Hugh Grant truly shines in the role of his career as bumbling bachelor Charles, whose main characteristics consist of being late to weddings, stumbling over words, and fear of commitment to one woman.  Grant is romantic and sympathetic without being coy, and I found myself falling in love along with Andie MacDowell!  But the best part of the film is the supporting cast.  I think it is responsible for the film's status as a comedy classic.  Charlotte Coleman is perfect as fiery Scarlett, David Bower is hilarious as David, a bumbling bachelor like Charles, but lacking his suave charm, and Simon Callow is fondly memorable as flamboyant Gareth, perhaps the funniest of them all.  My favorite performance, however, is that of Kristin Scott Thomas.  As the icy, longing Fiona, she's an understated revelation.  Director Mike Newell has called her performance the best of the film, and I agree.  Scott Thomas is a great ensemble player (see ""Gosford Park""), and here's hoping she lands another comedy soon.
There is a pitiful lack of special features on this DVD, but at half the price of most, it's still worth owning.  A movie this fun doesn't need lots of extras to justify its purchase.",1032739200,10,1589,4.947169811320754

Am I behind the times or did anyone else find the fact that MacDowell's character was prepared to cheat on her fiance the night before her marriage repellent? Likewise, Grant's character's acceptance of this as perfectly normal behaviour? We are meant to go on finding these two promiscuous wretches cute. MacDowell then has the nerve to blame her husband for the failure of her marriage. Cringe.
I also find it odd that a gay man would want to give a speech in church when the 'good' book has hardly been welcoming towards homosexuality. The film then gets terribly maudlin over the fact that this man believes his life is no more because he will never meet another fat, loud, hairy man again. Er....

Weddings and funerals (and what happens during weddings and funerals) thus have special significance and meaning--so much so that this movie skips everything in between such as work and weekends and nevertheless manages to paint a lively and detailed portrait of a network of family and friendship, romance and relationship.
Four Weddings and a Funeral is set in the ""best parts"" of the U.K. and thus technically qualifies as a ""foreign"" flick even though it's in English and probably made with an American audience in mind.  It stars Hugh Grant as the very eligible but slightly bumbling bachelor, and Andie McDowell as the more forward American with the engaging smile.  They seem to have been made for their respective roles.  This movie was a real treat for me.

591680,3,6303165680,"This movie raised Hugh Grant to stardom, at least in North America'; watching his performance, it's easy to see why.  He's his typical likeable self - self-effacing, witty, bashful, and fun, all at the same time.  It's a little more difficult to see why this film was nominated for best picture - it's only a good, not a great, movie.  There are parts that are brilliant, but something is missing to tie the pieces together.
Most glaring is the existence and motivation for Andie McDowell's character - why is she at these weddings?  She can jets an incredible distance to come, yet seems to be unknown and is ignored by the wedding guests.  It doesn't help that the character itself is two-dimensional and acts solely at the whim of the screenplay.  Grant is left alone to carry the narrative forward on his own, but this time has virtually no help from the supporting characters, each of which has too little screen time to develop any personality.  The inevitable comparison to the more recent ""Notting Hill"" hurts 4 Weddings.  ""Hill"" has fewer characters, but they are better developed (and likeable), much to its advantage.
Having said that, Grant's performance alone is worth the price of admission, and there are some good laughs.  The DVD itself is terrible - the picture and sound are fine, but there are no extras whatsoever.  Surely a film that was nominated for best picture (and one for which Grant won a Golden Globe) deserves better treatment than this.",1013990400,5,1468,4.7896825396825395

The only real drawback to the story involves the development of Andie MacDowell's character.  Her character is too unevenly drawn.  A long --------- very long, excruciatingly long --------- courtship would be the only way to go with someone as flighty and mixed up as her character is in this movie.

And the ""funeral"" of the title is a powerful scene as it celebrates the life of one friend who unexpectedly dies in the course of the proceedings.

591684,5,6303165680,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" may not be the greatest movie in the history, but it surely is the best modern romantic comedy I ever saw.  The only film that can possibly surpass this delightful one is, perhaps, ""When Harry Met Sally ...""  Maybe tied.
Hugh Grant has starred in many films since then, but his best role is still Charles of this film, who unwittingly finds his love in Carrie, an open-hearted American played by beautiful Andie MacDowell at his friend's wedding.  One miatake is, he foolishly couldn't realize it before he let her go after one-night stand.  But as the number of ceremony goes up (including one funeral), he gradually comes to notice that he threw away the best thing in his life.  And while he is wondering what to do, friends around him start to search for their real love, including his own brother David, his timid friend Tom, Tom's sister Fiona, and Charles's eccentric roommate Scarlet.  But where should Charles go?  Going back to his countless ex-girlfriends?  Or, Carrie?  But she got already married.
To be honest, a little abrupt ending of the film damages an entire movie's strength a bit, but all comedies have to pay the price to end the show within an appointed hour.  What is incredibly splendid about ""Four Weddings"" is that the characters are all so lively and sparkling with witty dialogue that you think they are not acting at all.  Actually, on top of Hugh Grant, many actors are still associated with the roles in this film even if they got more populality after this film; Kristin Scott Thomas is later to be nominated Oscar for her turn in ""English Patient,"" but she will be remembered as deliciously aristocratic Fiona.  John Hannah made his name popular through the Hollywood blockbuster series of ""Mummy,"" but still he is kind-hearted Matthew to those who have seen him recite W H Auden (most touching moment) in ""Four Weddings.""  This is that kind of film that changes the cast's life.  It happens once in your lifetime.
With this great ensemble cast, we have fantastic script by Richard Curtis, filled with funny lines uttered by completely  believable characters.  He does not fail to take great care of minor characters, and give them equally good moments.  Look how Serena, in love with handsome David who is hearing impaired, learns sign.  Trying to impress him, she mixes up ""nice"" with ""mice,"" but, you know, when boys and girls are in love. nothing can stop them from understanding each other.  Cute.
Brilliantly written, ""Four Weddings"" is a superb model of romantic comedy.  If you like this type of movie, you surely will fall in love with it; and if you're not, your mind will be changed just like mine (I didn't expected much from it, so I didn't go to theater until the last day).  And the film never forgets the sad side of life as the title implies.  Sad thing is one of the cast Charlotte Coleman, who played most unconventional bridesmaid Scarlett, has passed away recently.  She is terrific.",1011916800,57,2968,4.742690058479532
591685,5,6303165680,"The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" directed by Mike Newell.  Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar.  Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next.  Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he's had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp.  Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him.  It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it's only-- as they say-- the beginning.
 Set in contemporary England, one of the aspects of this film that makes it so engaging is the propriety with which the humor is presented.  Refreshingly subtle, there's more of Noel Coward than Tom Green or Rob Schneider to it; a matter of manners, mores and innuendo taking precedence over gross-out, in-your-face, shock schlock humor.  And though Grant and MacDowell are at the forefront of the piece, Newell does an excellent job of developing all of the characters, succinctly supplying enough detail to each individual to give the film some depth and dimension, without having to actually go too deep.  He never lets you forget that first and foremost, this is a comedy.  There's some insight provided, but this is not an in-depth commentary on human nature, though there are some overtones and implications in that direction (Charles is always late to the weddings, for example; perhaps a subconscious denial of the impending nuptials?).  Most importantly, the characterizations are rich, and the story is involving and presented with an even flow that allows you to effortlessly be swept away with it.
 Certain actors make a career out of playing a variation of the same character in film after film, striving for that definitive portrayal.  W.C. Fields played the hen-pecked husband in a number of films, finally perfecting that particular character in the person of Harold Bissonette in ""It's A Gift.""  For Hugh Grant, it's the retiring, somewhat self-conscious and stammering, eyelid fluttering charmer, of which he's done a variation in such films as ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill, But Came Down A Mountain,"" Notting Hill"" and ""Mickey Blue Eyes.""  But Charles is his definitive portrayal of that character, the one in which he achieves the balance and honesty that makes the character so believable.  It's a good bit of work by Grant, and definitely one of his most memorable performances.
 Andie MacDowell, meanwhile, gives a rather composed performance as Carrie, the quiet American with a reserved bluntness who captivates Charles.  MacDowell brings a sense of quietude to the role that is sensuously seductive, which lends credibility to Charles' infatuation with her.  It's a role for which MacDowell is perfectly suited, as it allows her to play effectively to her naturally calm demeanor and exquisite beauty and femininity.
 In a part that has to be an actor's dream, Simon Callow is absolutely exuberant as Gareth, one of the fixtures of Charles' circle of friends.  More than just an effervescent character, Gareth is something of the conscience of the film, laughing away and laying bare any and all pretense or hypocrisy like a modern day flesh-and-blood Spirit of Christmas Present.  It's a character that gives needed balance and perspective to the film, and he's wonderfully played by Callow.
 Also turning in especially noteworthy performances are John Hannah as Matthew; Kristin Scott Thomas, who is quite alluring as Fiona; James Fleet as Tom, a character very reminiscent of his Hugo in the TV series ""The Vicar of Dibley,"" (and very effective here); Charlotte Coleman, memorable in the role of Scarlett; and Rowan Atkinson as the hapless Father Gerald.
 Rounding out the supporting cast are David Bower (David), Timothy Walker (Angus), Sara Crowe (Laura), Anna Chancellor (Henrietta), Simon Kunz (John), David Haig (Bernard), Sophie Thompson (Lydia Jane) and Corin Redgrave (Hamish).  There's enough twists and turns along the way to keep this film unpredictable, including one scene near the end that initially seems so mean-spirited that it may have you biting your fist and crying, ""Oh, NO!""  But, not to worry, Newell provides an instant resolution consistent with the rest of the film, and it not only works but gets a good laugh to boot.  Entertaining, pleasant and funny, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" makes for a satisfying, feel-good cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today.  It's what's known as the magic of the movies.",1009584000,,5163,5.07810650887574

However, hopefully I will be able to limit this bias by reviewing FOUR WEDDINGS as objectively as I can, as a movie, because I can see its merits - and its downfalls.
I think the plot has been covered fairly well already, and is pretty much nothing more than  a ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back"" kinda situation. Nothing amazing. What is amazing is the way in which Richard Curtis as a writer flawlessly captures that atmoshpere that always seem to be at British weddings; being British myself, I can say that his portrayal of the wedings (and the funeral) did completely and utterly capture the English eccentricity and reserve perefectly.
However, once we finally got round to the last wedding, I was yawning - it was far too much of the same thing. It would have been more interesting to put some of those characters that appeared at all the weddings in another situation.
When watching films such as FOUR WEDDINGS and NOTTING HILL, it is obvious just how few famous faces there are in British comedy; almost every single little cameo role in FOUR WEDDINGS  was played by a relatively famous British comedic actor or actress, right down to Rowan Atkinson making an appearance with his co-star from THE THIN BLUE LINE, James Dreyfus. All these ""familair faces"" do add to the appeal of the movie for many people, and all play their parts wonderfully, but they do seem to be typecast - hardly any of them actually played anything that was a long way from work they have already done.
The ending of the movie is truly terrible; it is so cheesy that I actually groaned out loud at the scene in the rain. Un until there, the movie had consintently hit just off-centre, which was nice, but the scene was unbearably predictable and trite. What was Richard Curtis thinking of?!
Despite all this, FOUR WEDDINGS is a good movie - I just don't like it, but don't let that put you off.

591743,1,6303165680,"Where to begin with this cack? Any film made for ?middle Americans about Britain/the British is going to be heading for the file marked ""For the Hard of Thinking"".
Think Friends (in London), think Austin  Powers, think Dudley Moore, in fact don't think. Just leave your brain at  the video counter when you rent this.
How this cringing pot-boiler passed  the British Board of Censorship is beyond me.  No tired cliche is left  unturned, no stereotype is not brought from the grave, plotlines don't turn  left or right they chunder onwards to the final scene where even in terms  of nauseating feel-good Hollywood endings for the emotionally-challenged  they go some.  You expect everybody to give each other a PC Telly  Tubby-style Big Hug.
Don't get me wrong, this isn't a diatribe against  American thinking, merely the mince that you get when you cater for the  lowest denominator - ie money.",963532800,8,895,4.8933333333333335

7840319,4,6303165680,"You could really feel the chemistry between the two main characters, Charles and Carrie. Not only that, you could believe that the ensemble (Fiona, Scarlett, Tom, Gareth and Matthew) were best friends. As for David, I did notice he got excluded a lot, especially with nobody interpreting for him. The ensemble didn't seem to care enough to learn BSL.

What I really look for in a comedy is jokes that hit more than miss, not just one person being funny (or the only comic relief), and a genuine plot with realistic characters and good development.

This movie is very timeless, with things that could date the movie easily overlooked.  The humor is absolutely spot-on and any second-hand embarrassment is always very quick. The cast had an excellent sense of comedy timing, and they all are equally funny in their own way. This movie has a pretty good character development, as much as you can show in a short period of time taking place over a long period of time. Overall, the movie is a splendid example of a good romantic comedy.",1519257600,,1033,4.696132596685083
