6582942,5,B00MIA0I16,Like always I enjoy these Gene Autry 4 disc editions. One titles from 1949 in this set was not as well restored as I would have hoped with the picture so-so and the sound a little muddy. I can't help thinking that had Columbia retained ownership of their Autry titles they would have issued a pristine edition of that title like their other archive releases. That said I would not be without it and look forward to the Volume 9 that has two 3o's titles I have been chasing for years and once had on 16mm. Recommended if you are a Gene Autry fan.,1419724800,,545,4.25

6582944,5,B00MIA0I16,"As we mentioned earlier, all of these Timeless Gene Autry volumes are excellent.  Very pleased with the picture and sound quality and we have collected each volume as they have been released.  We would like to have Timeless release albums of other great western stars' movies. We recommend this to all B-Western movie fans.",1417046400,5,323,4.962962962962963

8672513,4,B00MIA0I16,"I'll rate this collection as four stars to balance out the good and the bad.  The movies are so variable in story quality.  As usual the picture and sound  quality are excellent.
TRAIL TO SAN ANTONE is average but the acting by the brothers is hokey and dated.  Peggy Stewart is always enjoyable.  I also like Tris Coffin as the ""smooth heavy"".  I like Gene's songs.
RIDERS OF THE WHISTLING PINES is the reason I love B-westerns.  This movie rates right up there at the top.  A good story with many twists and turns and a surprise ending.  Many fine songs.  Patricia White is an especially good leading lady.  On the ""Melody Ranch Theater"", where Gene talks with Pat Buttram about the movie, they have substituted the segment for BEYOND THE PURPLE HILLS, because the master for this segment has been lost.  Buy Collection 8 for this movie.
RIDERS IN THE SKY is a somewhat convoluted story that is brought down by poor acting and too many scenes that are just plain stupid and don't make sense.
SAGINAW TRAIL from 1953 is one of Autry's final and most slapdash pictures.  Literally everything about the story is ludicrous.  The story takes place in Michigan but looks suspiciously like the same old rocks around southern California where all the western movies were made.  Furthermore, in 1827 there were no such things as six-guns, cowboy clothes and hats, and Gene has a sword fight at the climax which leaves much to be desired.  You can easily spot his double doing the work.  Smiley Burnette is back and hasn't learned a new comedy trick in 20 years.  In the ""Melody Ranch Theater"" segment, Gene and Pat talk about Errol Flynn.  If this movie is where Autry westerns were headed it was time for him to quit the movies.  Not recommended.",1474243200,,1740,4.624183006535947
8672514,3,B00MIA0I16,"I am a huge Gene Autry fan but I was disappointed in this set.  First, the films appear quite dark in the dvd transfer.  ""Trail To San Antone"" looked much brighter in the original vhs release.  ""Riders In The Sky"" was based on the hit song ""Ghost Riders In The Sky"" that was popularized by Frankie Laine, Vaughn Monroe...and of course...Gene Autry. It has some interesting ""ghost riders"" photography.  ""Saginaw Trail"" is the weakest film in the set.  By 1953, Gene was looking a little pudgy and past his prime. This must have been one of Gene's last films with Smiley Burnette who looks sick, tired, and ready to retire.  Buy this if you want to complete a collection, otherwise skip it.",1466208000,,688,4.598360655737705
8672515,4,B00MIA0I16,I love campy westerns and Gene Autry's westerns bring back great times as a child. These remastered westerns are fairly good quality most everyone who enjoys the genre will appreciate.,1453248000,,184,5.166666666666667
