7006961,4,B00TFSYSN8,"Lemurs are wonderful. So beautiful, amazing athletes, friendly and kind. They are having trouble maintaining a foothold on Madagascar, the only place where they live. Many efforts are being made to ensure their survival and health. This movie will be a contribution as it educates and entertains at the same time. Seeing the lemurs co-operate in groups, bond with new lemurs, swing in trees, climb almost vertical surfaces with ease is mesmerizing.
Loved the lemurs, of course, and Morgan Freeman's wonderful voice. If you haven't seen him as Henry Deacon on ""Eureka"", you should. It's on Amazon. Not liked are the musical effects which the lemurs don't need! They're sort of Disney-ish.  One time that the music makes sense is when the lemurs leap and dance as if they were in a ballet. Classical ballet music would have been more appropriate.
Lovers of lemurs will be gratified by this film, and those unacquainted with lemurs will fall in love.",1427155200,6,947,4.955974842767295
7006962,4,B00TFSYSN8,"Island of Lemurs: Madagascar is a nature film made for IMAX theaters, not for a PBS viewershipmeaning its geared for a popular audience rather than one looking to learn every detail they can about animals and their environment.

IMAX movies are typically experiencesmovies shot in higher definition on 70mm film that can then be shown on screens way larger than anything youd see in a standard movie theater, and with no loss of detail if you sit in the front rows. Shots have tended toward the dramaticaerial panoramas, whales breeching, fires blazing out of control, and wilderness adventureswith early short films including The Eruption of Mount St. Helens!, Fires of Kuwait, and Alaska: Spirit of the Wild.  So its somewhat of a deviation for a less naturally dramatic nature film like Island of Lemurs: Madagascar to get the IMAX treatment.

Featured primatologist Patricia Wright worked tirelessly to establish a 107,000-acre national park on the island of Madagascar to protect the 12 species of lemurs that live there. Maybe she has connections (or fans) in high places, because there isn't a better way to raise awareness of a cause than with a 3D IMAX movie.

Wright and her work are showcased in Island of Lemurs, but the stars are, of course, the lemurs themselves. Lemurs tend to hop and jump a lot, using their strong hind legs, and theres amazing footage of Sifakas, who naturally hop sideways so that it looks like they're dancing, hopping across a beach. We also see Brown Mouse Lemurs, a little tinier and pudgier than the others, fearless flinging themselves from tree to tree. And we watch Indriids and their peculiar way they have of singing. You can look up information on these and find that their calls can be heard more than a mile away, but you won't get that kind of specific information here. IMAX is a celebration of exotic places and phenomena, and the emphasis here is on these amazing creatures themselves.

Fans of the old Zoboomafoo TV series will recognize Zoboo, or rather, his kind: a fairly common black-and-white ruffed lemur. There are ringtailed lemurs too that will be familiar to people whove seen them in zoos. But there are some unique sites to be seen as well. Were told that the Island of Lemurs crew managed to capture the very first baby lemur ever filmed, and the little fellow is positively otherworldy looking. The film also captures on camera one of the worlds most rare and seldom-seen lemurs, a Greater Bamboo Lemur that hasn't been spotted in Madagascar for 50 years. So there are sights here that are memorable, including an unlikely visual of two local Malagasys who make a living by chopping down bananas in the mountains and bringing them to market, racing their rickety cargo-heavy go-carts down the steep and windy roads.

Like other IMAX films, this one has been remastered for HDTV and cropped to fit a 16x9 monitor. Morgan Freeman narrates and also appears on-camera in one of the bonus features which, in keeping with the length of the movie itself, are quite short. Unlike other IMAX films, this one isn't mostly about the viewing experience. Its a film intended to raise awareness. Ninety percent of the lemurs habitat has been lost to timber companies, and an island that once supported more than 400 different species of lemurs is now home to fewer than half that amount. Some of the species are highly endangered, but this film couldn't have found better poster children than the wild lemurswho turn out to be quite tame when it comes to interacting with humans who happen upon them. If they could talk, theyd say it:  Help me. Im cute. Im docile. And Im the only primate that goes back to the time of dinosaurs. Were relatives. What more can I say?

Island of Lemurs: Madagascar is only 39 minutes long, and everyones first impulse may be to pronounce it too short. Watching it will probably whet your appetite for more information about these little fellows, and thats probably not a bad thing.  A longer movie may have been more satisfying, but this way you can get involved in doing a little research yourself. If the film moves you and your family, check out the Centre ValBio website to learn more, and consider donating to help further Wrights research and conservation efforts.

7006964,5,B00TFSYSN8,"Unlike some other primates, lemurs do not have prehensile tails (they cannot hang by their tails from trees like monkeys) but they do have long, wet noses. Lemurs have a keen sense of smell and they also have good vision, even at night. Their thumbs and big toes are opposable, but they mainly use their teeth and an extended ""toilet claw"" on the second toe of their hind feet for grooming. The aye-aye, a fascinating lemur with an elongated, claw-like middle finger which it uses to dig insects out of tree bark, is also nocturnal, and is often feared by the Malagasy people of its native Madagascar because of its unusual appearance. The Lemurs in this IMAX documentary are very friendly and infact if you visit Madagascar, you will be able to feed them personally see it is a major tourist attraction. BBC produced a great documentary with the talented, dedicated and educated David Attenborough in regard to Lemurs in 2011 called Madagascar. This documentary is by IMAX is different than the BBC's production since IMAX is the highest quality image format available anywhere. I always insure to watch IMAX documentaries first in a true IMAX facility, not the ones that are built for few hours of action movies without the huge curved screens and without the especial slopped sittings. Due to the expensive IMAX format, no documentaries is over something like forty minutes long but with IMAX format in a IMAX theater one gets to experience the film as close to reality as possible. This is a fun and entertaining documentary, incredible shots, starring Morgan Freeman, with a music out of this world. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1424390400,19,1625,4.870036101083032

7006990,3,B00TFSYSN8,"It's a nice film, but narrated only about 1/3 of the time and is more or less the story of one woman's crusade to save lemurs than a documentary about lemurs as a whole. All in all, I enjoyed it, but I was also happy that I got it during a price reduction for $10. I'll watch it again, the 3D is great, soundtrack is good, and content is enlightening.. but I felt like the trailers kind of misled me about what I was purchasing.",1442275200,,428,4.047058823529412

7006994,2,B00TFSYSN8,"Having been a researcher in Madagascar, I can say that while some of the information in this film is accurate, very much of it is speculation, or just plain false altogether, and it is way over-dramatized.  If you want more factual information, see David Attenborough's film on Madagascar.  I have also been to Ranomafana, where Patricia Wright works, and while her park is really well-constructed, it is really not having good effects on the villagers living nearby.  Ask them how they feel about the creation of the park ten years ago, and you get lots of shifty looks and even shiftier answers.  The people are being negatively impacted by the influx of foreign tourists, and while the park guides are the highest-paid in Madagascar, the rest of the people are becoming poorer, creating huge class differences and thus animosity between different classes.  Her research center is truly state-of-the-art, with lots of great equipment.  However, it also has entire closets full of pillows and really fancy showers, too (I didn't even use a pillow the entire time I was in Madagascar; so few citizens have them, and I only ever took bucket baths, which is all that most people have access to), creating even larger divides between those who work in the park and those forced to live on the margins.  Additionally at the end of the film it shows Patricia Wright petting and interacting with lemurs in the wild.  This is bad for the lemurs because it lessens their fear of humans, making them easier targets for bushmeat hunters and making them less likely to run during slash-and-burn events in their forests.  Patricia Wright's story might be a good one from a conservation perspective, but it is a sad one from a social perspective, and if conservation is going to be truly lasting, it needs to benefit both the environment and the local people in order for them to feel like they should invest in conservation strategies.",1440374400,4,1923,4.856269113149847

7006997,4,B00TFSYSN8,"Worthy, but short.  If you love the type nature documentaries featuring David Attenborough, you'll find this one a little threadbare on details and lacking in scientific content.  Also, the narration is a little repetitive, but not so much so to make it a turn off.  I'd purchase it again, but I hoping for more.  It almost felt at times like it was a film produced by Disney because it has lots of the obligatory ""world music"" and seemed to be produced with a heavy input from someone's marketing department.  I would have preferred a more in-depth focus on the lemurs themselves with less emphasis on the ""entertainment"" world music factor.  This is a very good DVD in many respects, but definitely not BBC quality in terms of content.",1439510400,6,737,4.71875
7006998,4,B00TFSYSN8,A delightful CD that provides lovely footage of the lemurs of Madagascar. Well narrated by Morgan Freeman.

I also read where a teacher showed the video to her class and that it was enjoyed by all of her students. I'm sure that the students saw the ""flat"" version.

It lacked a lot of details of how the animals interact with each other, the environment, gather food and find mates. I just felt they had so much potentials to showcase the lemurs and the world they live in. The documentary was on the short side at around 40 minutes.

 The video quality was top notch, and what we got to see was fun and interesting at times. Narration was good. Overall if you love Lemurs you'll always love watching lemurs no matter what they do or you learn about them. So yet it's not the best done documentary, it still will give you some viewing pleasure for a lemur lover.

Ringtails, indri, loris, bamboo lemurs, ruffed lemurs, dancing lemurs and mouse lemurs (the worlds smallest primate)  they only live on Madagascar, an island nation about the size of Texas. Primatologist Patricia Wright, a former social worker, tells us all about them in an IMAX documentary courtesy of Warner Home Video. Morgan Freeman provides narration.

Its a fast 40-minute film in which the IMAX 3-D picture centers us into the lemurs world ranging from tropical rain forests to sunlit beaches to towering cliffs. Warners presentation allows us to also watch in 2-D Blu-ray or DVD and its all beautiful  especially these furry, wild-eyed creatures whose varieties Id never known about. They are the stars of any show, climbing, soaring through the air, singing and dancing (all without animation). The Master Audio 5.1 surround track mixes natural, ambient sound with narration and a so-so score from Mark Mothersbaugh. Could have done without the Hawaiian lounge music selections.

We learn about how lemurs originated in Africa before the dinosaurs and how they drifted  literally  to the shores of friendly Madagascar, where they began to develop all their unique varieties. There are no soul-rocking shots of predators or poachers, but we discover their habitat has been reduced by 90% through deliberate burning meant to create more land for agriculture and grazing. Wright informs about the uphill battle to create national parks and other safety zones, while educating locals about the parks value. Wright cautions that lemurs cannot live in captivity; theres no rescue waiting outside of their natural environment. Lemurs, sadly, are yet another endangered species that can only be saved through aggressive conservation.

Bonus features  two-to-six minutes in length  emphasize the documentarys findings. Making The Island of Lemurs shows how the IMAX film was made while Wright, director/cinematographer David Douglas and writer/producer David Fellman speculate more on how lemurs arrived and thrived on the island. Meet Patricia Wright provides more about her background and love for these likeable creatures; A Baby Indri and Five Things About Indri highlights young scientists while showing footage of animals never filmed before; The Cutest Lemur, at two-minutes, is just that. Go-Kart Racers shows how a scene was filmed, and the brave soundman who captured them for our edification and enlightenment.

Island of Lemurs: Madagascar is a welcome look at these furry free spirits. I only wish the film had been longer. It might be possible to just watch these critters for hours.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,,2669,5.371702637889689

7007043,5,B00TFSYSN8,"Stunning clarity, superb photography and outstanding 3D images... Hard to believe tithe Lemurs have survived for billions of years only to be reduced to a few 200 on this remote island...a must for viewing by the entire family both for its informative content and exceptional visual splendor.. don't miss it!!!!",1428451200,,311,5.24
7007044,2,B00TFSYSN8,Far more political than I was expecting. I was hoping for a more David Attenborough style of behavior and scientific documentary,1428451200,3,128,5.142857142857143
8701543,5,B00TFSYSN8,"then, it would be as awesome as this film, and anything else he does

Well narrated, and beautifully filmed.  Worth watching. Informative and entertaining.",1534464000,,155,5.416666666666667
8701544,3,B00TFSYSN8,"We love the lemurs.  I've been looking for this video for a long time and it's been hard to come by.  We were somewhat disappointed that most of this video is sweeping helicopter shots, people talking to each-other, and follow-shots of scientists walking through jungle landscape.  I'd estimate that about 20% of the footage in this video is actually of lemurs at all.  You should probably just go search around Youtube if you want to actually see video of lemurs.",1529971200,,464,4.7625
8701545,5,B00TFSYSN8,I thought I was going to be buying a DVR/CD rather than a opportunity to watch it.  But I do love the subject matter.,1515283200,,117,3.875
8701546,1,B00TFSYSN8,I purchased this DVD for my grandson who is fascinated with lemurs.  The video was sent to their address and upon arrival discovered it is actually only for blu-ray. His parents are firefighter and flight nurse and work long shifts and to pack up the DVD and mail back for refund is not worth the trouble at this time.  I would not have purchased it for blu ray only.,1496707200,,367,4.304347826086956
8701547,3,B00TFSYSN8,"It was a pretty short DVD, thought it would have more to it.  Guess I didn't check to see how long it would be, thought it would be at least an hour.  Was probably about 1/2 that.  What we did see was good, but not worth the $.",1492992000,,227,3.6875
