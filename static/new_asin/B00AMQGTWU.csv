8553904,5,B00AMQGTWU,"One of us grew up on Marty Stouffer and the other never more than a few minutes in classrooms. But both of us enjoy watching these and this one, Spectacular Showdowns, is one of our favorites so far. There is less gore than some, more theatrics and a wonderful display of a range of species interacting. These ""showdowns"" include hunger, territorial, mating, hunting, etc etc, and the critters run from the small to the incredibly large - the Grizzly Bear footage alone is spectacular. Like I said, one of our favorites!",1403481600,2,520,4.725274725274725

8553906,5,B00AMQGTWU,"Our whole family enjoys this dvd over and over again...I really like the Wolverine and wolf encounter...man those little buggers are tough!

The only part we didn't like were the references to evilution...the earth isn't millions and billions of years old, only thousands of years!

Buy it today...you won't be disappointed!",1370044800,,324,5.333333333333333
