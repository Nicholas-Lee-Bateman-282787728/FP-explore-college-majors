8573150,5,B00BRN2A3O,"Fantastic collection!  Contrary to other comments I've read here, I think the quality is extremely good, especially considering how old these films are.  I was pleasantly surprised at how many of his major works are included.  The price was also exceptional.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  It's a wonderful addition to my DVD collection.

To make it even more enjoyable, I also read his autobiography ""My Autobiography"" simultaneously.  That was one of the best autobiographies I've ever read, as well as giving a lot of background info regarding the films in this collection, which made them all the more enjoyable to watch.  And his films still made me laugh out loud all these years later, and without sound or state-of-the-art special effects.  This man truly was a multi-talented genius.  This collection renewed my love, respect, admiration, and appreciation for the incomparable Charlie Chaplin.",1391990400,,906,5.229166666666667

Item includes just DVD-R instead of original DVD's with very low quality of video.
If you want quality and originals, just go somewhere else.
