Paster Hagee is right on the money (as always) with getting after the devil and his tricks. Harry Potter is a bold approach to witchcraft. It's packaged for the pleasure of kids entertainment but is full force based on occult practices that witches have stated follow along the path of their teachings and beliefs. The older Harry gets the darker his practice of studies become until he is involved with raising the dead with blood rituals and speaking to ""familiars"" which are nothing more then familiar spirits (demons) of the bible. People have fallen for the lie and many will find themselves opening doors to the spirit realm they will wish they had kept closed. The devil plays for keeps and the younger he can get the mind twisted the harder it will be to untwist it when it's older. This is not harmless fantasy for the author herself doesn't speak of this ""harmless innocents"" like the supports of these books (including Christians) so strongly do. She is very open to the darkness of her material and states to the reader as such. She's not trying to hide a thing yet the world has bought the lie of ""safe and harmless"". Scripture talks about such things and it's up to us to test the spirits (refer: 1John4:1). Would recommend. Wake up folks, this is plain occult witchcraft.",1369612800,,1403,4.661290322580645
