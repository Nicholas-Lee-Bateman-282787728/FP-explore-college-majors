8304672,4,B001GAO58Q,"Squire is my favorite bass player so I enjoyed listening to him explain his techniques, tell the history of his basses', playing several, and just his discussion of bass playing and music in general. However this is not a lesson on how to play bass guitar. He does give a few tips. Overall I'm glad I got this.",1434499200,3,310,4.362068965517241
8304673,5,B001GAO58Q,"Chris talks about his playing style...shares a few secrets of how he gets certain sounds......but doesn't go into his effects or amps.  He shows his various basses and talks alittle about each.  Much of what he says is all general knowledge to Yes fans...and is available on the websie.

I wish he would have showed his gear and how he uses it all......Especially the effects.....His own website shows his gear....but there is no futher explanation of how he uses it and why he chose certain items.

For the Yes fan......this is a treat",1413676800,,536,4.731182795698925
