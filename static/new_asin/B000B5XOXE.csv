2400524,3,B000B5XOXE,"When ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island"" came out in 1998, I doubt many people thought Scooby Doo would make it up to this 9th movie. Scooby may actually hold the record as far as good sequels go. This may be because there is the gang we all know and love for consistency, but there is a different adventure everytime. No one story is ever just repeated. The original ""Star Trek"" movies also did very well in this category, but even they only made it up to Chapter 6. If you follow my reviews, you know I think ""Zombie Island"" (# 1) and ""Witch's Ghost"" (# 2) were the two best. I didn't much like ""Alien Invasion"" (# 3) or ""Cyber Chase.""(# 4)  I thought ""Legend of the Vampire"" (# 5) was really good. ""Monster of Mexico"" (# 6) was decent at best. ""Loch Ness Monster"" (# 7) was a decent watch. ""Aloha Scooby Doo"" (# 8) was surprisingly good. Well, onto chapter 9. It grabs our attention with a flashback of Cleopatra. This is a good technique. For not only does it set the mood, but it allows us some ambiguity. (Is the curse staged? Or is it possibly real?) Well, part of the curse seems real at first. Moving on, Velmah is off doing some work in Egypt with a friend, and of course in a typical Scooby fashion, she is reunited with her gang. After the initial ice breaking, we soon meet the antagonists of this story. (A team of so called archeologists who are really thieves. Yes. The famous Indiana Jones was often thought of as this, but we won't go there.) Well, this gang of thieves basically wants to loot the tomb of Cleopatra. Additional elements of Cleopatra's curse start to come true. (Real or not?) There are several old touches with new twists. Poor Scooby and Shaggy get lost, but in a twist of fate, they find their own fan club. At first we may think this is a silly irrelevant subplot, but in the end we see it certainly isn't. I can't say much more without ruining the movie for you, but even at chapter 9, Scooby gives us enough familiar things and enough new twists. The different subplots of the movie come together surprisingly well, and we are offered a surprise twist ending that will make us want to see the movie again with hindsight. I'll conclude by saing that I seriously doubt that any other series can boast of standing this strong at 9 movies. Scooby Doo, please come back for chapter 10 soon!",1144454400,13,2319,4.368055555555555
2400525,4,B000B5XOXE,"When my 3.5 yr old fell in love with Scooby, I decided to rent DVD's instead of buying (after purchasing every Thomas the Tank engine ones, that he no longer will watch...I learned :)

Anyway we rented this one and after having it for a week, we went out the very day we returned it and bought it. The story line is very good and truly I had no idea who the ""bad guy"" was. The music was good and the special feature rap video is hilarious.

After seeing all the Scooby movies so far, this is the one we just HAD to buy.",1143504000,13,519,3.980769230769231
2400526,4,B000B5XOXE,My son likes this Scooby Doo movie.  It's kind of scary for young children but older kids will like it.,1142035200,,103,4.15
2400527,4,B000B5XOXE,"Okay, we understand that a Scooby-Doo mystery is not going to be in the same league as a Citizen Kane mystery. But Scooby has good movies and bad movies just like any other Mega-Star. I'm pleased to say that Where's My Mummy is in the former category.

Velma is assisting an archaeological dig in Egypt (on the Sphinx no less) when she finds a mysterious necklace which could be the key to Cleopatra's lost treasure. I've never heard of such treasure, but for the sake of the movie, we'll pretend it exists. The rest of the Mystery Inc. gang turn up to visit her but the site is promptly taken over by Amelia von Butch (Christine Baranski), a gun-ho Lara Croft-type and her band of cohorts.

Despite warnings of ancient curses she forces the Mystery Inc. gang and an obnoxious reality-TV host (Jeremy Piven) to enter the tomb with her to solve it's secrets and find the treasure. Immediately setting-off traps, Shaggy and Scooby are separated from the rest of the gang (not on purpose for a change) and get involved in their own mystery of a deranged Hotep (Ron Pearlman) and his followers who worship a strange God known as Scoobis and his servant Shagman.

Both stories are kept lively and entertaining until they merge into one. There's not a moment of boredom and, as usual, a couple of cool original songs too. But sadly, no new version of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You at all. To compare it with similar films like Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider or even The Goonies would be pointless. Yes, we've seen this kind of thing before but animation is a medium that present more opportunities than live-action and there's loads of inventive set-pieces and imaginative locations that have become the standard of modern Scooby-Doo outings.

And what do you know? It even manages to provide a rather surprising twist at the end. We know it's far-fetched and unbelievable as always, but it ties together pretty well, thus making the film a little bit better a little bit more.

As long as their is imagination behind this franchise, Scooby-Doo could go on forever. He may deliver a few duds from time to time (Monster of Mexico was extremely crap after all) but he still a very important character in modern animation and will always come out on top if we believe in him.

Or am I taking this too seriously?

The movie was storyboarded and framed at 1.78:1 but the DVD is unfortunately full frame. The Dolby 5.1 sound design is quite lively though. And the extras are minimal and aimed at the kids.",1140912000,5,2485,4.646924829157175
2400528,5,B000B5XOXE,I am a huge Scooby Doo fan. I watched it for years and this is the best one by far. The story line was great. I'll recommend it any day.,1138838400,,136,3.566666666666667
2400529,4,B000B5XOXE,"The DVD begins with an advertisement for the Batman vs. Dracula DVD then jumps to 41BCE with the Romans sacking Egypt. Cleopatra narrates and sets the the background information for the film's curse and treasure. Immediately after the monologue the credits start with familiar voice talents,like Casey Kasem, for the main characters. (Credits for the voice talents are also shown at the end of the film but this time there's a screen shot of the character in addition to the name).

Velma discovers an ornament while working with Prince Omar on a reconstruction/refurbishment of the fabled Sphinx. The discovery leads to more discoveries and the arrival of a crew of greedy treasure-hunters lead by Dr. Amilia Von Butch. Typical of the Mystery Machine it overheats in the desert when the rest of the gang is on their the way to the site to see for themselves what Velma has been doing for the last 6 months. Cancelled TV show host Rock River of ""Fear Faces"" (The tie-in with actual television is hard to miss) tries to get his once-popular but now off-the-air program back on the air with photos of the gang's scared faces and hopes to get pictures of the ""Army of the Undead""-Mummies who protect the riches. In a sidelight, Scooby is mistaken for a Pharoah by a group of people who have moved from around the world to live in Egypt and want to live their lives just like the ancient Egyptians. The comedy scene actually ties-in to the plot and it is funny to see Scooby & Shaggy ham-it-up.

Like previous shows there are a series of mishaps, chase scenes with musical interludes, traps, silly disguises by Shaggy and Scooby, disappearences, creepy mummies, Velma loses her glasses, Scooby snacks, split-ups, hide & seek, always hungry Scooby/Shaggy and good & false clues, etc. The only big change in the format has to do with the ""good guys"" at the end during the unmasking.

The DVD contains extra features:

National Geographic's ""Curse of Scooby's Lost Lunch"" provides some photos and cartoons of ancient Egyptian sites along with a brief history on a level intended for kids. The National Geographic character ""KID Y"" helps Shaggy and Scooby in this feature. There are also some advertisments for National Geographic products.

""Mummy Wrap"" Music Video is a cartoon with photos of Ancient Egyptian sites and cultural items with Scooby-Doo & Shaggy that is also a learning tool for youngsters.

Three deleted scenes are next on the DVD extras. The first has the character ""Triple A"" and cartoon info on camel's spit (Shaggy & Scooby get hit in the face). The second deals with a King Cobra snake and music played by ""Triple A"" who charms the snake rather than kill it. The third deleted scene involves scorpions-everybody, even ""Triple A"" runs!

The next to last extra is a section on the ""Mystery Voices"" where the voice actors talk about doing their character (Virginia Madison as ""Cleopatra"", Ron Perlman as ""Hotep"", etc)

The last extra item on the DVD is a game called ""Escape From the Ankh Chamber Challenge"". The cartoon game makes you dodge booby traps, decipher codes, etc.

This DVD also had a long list of advertisements for other DVDs at the very end on the extra's section.

The DVD comes in English Audio Only, but has subtitles for English, French, and Spanish. I wish it was also available in Spanish and French Audio, in order to reach a larger audience and help kids with learning other languages in a fun way.",1136073600,20,3433,4.783783783783784
2400530,5,B000B5XOXE,"This one was a very good Scooby movie, actually. ""Aloha"" and ""Alien Invaders"" were kinda of a let down, and the best one will always be ""Witch's Ghost"".

She discovers a relic that uncovers a secret passage to lost treasures, however there's the dreaded curse that turns the victim into stone. A lost village meets Scooby and they think he's a god who was destined to return to them.

The animation is very good, especially with realism in the quick sand. There's of course the clever jokes and mystery to solve. I really think they have a great voice acting team. This film also has an unexpected twist with the answer to the mystery.",1478217600,,694,4.507936507936508

It's probably not a surprise that this movie was one that we all loved.  It's a little different than the original show and I know that people that grew up with that show loved how they did it.  However, I like that they are updating the characters and the story lines.  This wasn't too scary for my kids and they have watched it more than once already.  I think we ended up getting this for about $5 when they had it on sale and ended up with a 24 hour rental of the streaming version, too.  Since I wasn't sure if it was going to be good I am glad it was cheap, but now that I've seen it I would have been more than willing to pay a little more to get it.

2400604,5,B000B5XOXE,My granddaughter loves it and watches it over and over again. The story line is great and it is scary enough and funny enough to keep her attention. Great buy.,1377993600,,159,4.333333333333333

2400608,3,B000B5XOXE,"Loosely based on the radio series I LOVE A MYSTERY and the television series THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS, the 1969-1970 Saturday morning cartoon series wasn't much liked by critics and educators--but it was a smash with kids.  (I was a fan myself.)  In each episode, the five characters found themselves dropped into an unlikely mystery, and after a good deal of running around, getting separated from each other, finding a clue or two, and (perhaps) some nifty music, they unmasked the bad guy.  It was all harmless fun, and it was popular enough to come back in several incarnations.

In 1998 the characters and basic premise resurfaced as a series of straight-to-video movies.  The first of these was SCOOBY-DOO ON ZOMBIE ISLAND.  Released in 2005, SCOOBY-DOO! IN WHERE'S MY MUMMY is the ninth in this particular series.  In this episode, Velma is on a team working to restore the Sphinx--and accidentally discovers a secret tomb between the Sphinx's paws.  She and project supervisor Prince Omar guard the secret, but when Fred, Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby arrive, so does the aptly named Dr. Amelia von Butch, who plans to raid the tomb.  When an ancient curse turns Velma and Dr. Omar to stone, the rest of the gang scramble to solve the mystery.  Although the clothing sometimes hints at the original 1969 styling, the characters have received an update in both appearance and attitude, but not so much that the original flavor is entirely lost.

The DVD has a number of mild bonuses.  The Scooby-Doo movies aren't exactly high-end animation, but they are well executed, and they have the joy of the familar: a chance to see Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, Scooby, and even The Mystery Machine back together again.  Very young children might not have the attention span for the hour-plus run time, but older kids will have a lot of fun.  Lots of fun!

2400610,4,B000B5XOXE,"This movie harkens back more to the days when Velma carried the group more.

Lots of Mummies, lots of swerves, not too convoluted, and just enough  Scooby and Shaggy freaking out.

Great movie.",1359849600,,193,4.787878787878788

2400615,3,B000B5XOXE,"In my babysitting years, lots of little boys loved watching Scooby Doo. The only trouble came at bedtime, when imaginations run rampant in the dark and dancing shadows. Scooby Doo in Where's My Mummy keeps the scare factor to a minimum. The mild creepiness and lots of action combine well to keep kids interested. The only downside to this movie is the overly simplistic dialogue. It will bore most adults, including grown-up fans of Scooby Doo.",1356739200,,445,4.868421052631579

2400626,5,B000B5XOXE,"This one is the best for many reasons but most of all because of the love and friendship and good-natured affinity the characters show for each other. They are actually written to care about each other as friends and the movie emphasizes their bonds which makes it fun and enjoyable and gives it more substance as well as makes the kids watching very happy. My son LOVES when the characters show affection for each other or have fun with each other, it makes him smile. Sometimes he even jumps off the couch and laughs and claps (he's 4.)

My son became totally interested in Egypt and the pyramids after seeing this movie.  It is visually stunning to watch with all it's vivid colors and right-on depictions of Cleopatra, the Sphinx, and Egypt.

During all this, the host of an annoying TV show is also on hand to film the restoration of the treasures and succeeds in being even more annoying.
