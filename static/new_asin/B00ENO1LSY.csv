5928454,5,B00ENO1LSY,GREAT MOVIE! The strawhats are split up and up against a super strong pirate. Nami is in trouble. If you're a One Piece fan you'll love it. It almost made me cry a few times.,1384905600,5,174,4.0
5928455,4,B00ENO1LSY,"This movie is now one of my favorite anime movies ever. This movie is lengthy, funny, and full of action. If you are a fan of One Piece I truly recommend this film.",1384560000,,164,4.0
5928456,5,B00ENO1LSY,"An exciting, breathtaking adventure written by the original creator, Eiichiro Oda. Strong World encompasses all the traits people have come to know and love about One Piece while introducing wonderfully colored new locations and whimsical characters with ties to the original story.
A fun treat for existing and new One Piece fans alike.",1381190400,,337,5.377358490566038
5928457,4,B00ENO1LSY,"Please don't get me wrong in my following review. I love One Piece to death. I have to many figures and plushes littering my room that if I had used the money wisely I'd have...something not One Piece. Anyway, as I was saying, One Piece is one of my all time favorite animes, up there with the Monogatari series by NisioIsin and Gurren Lagann.

This film is pretty great. It's got amazing visuals that had me watching the movie for days just admiring all the different environments the Straw Hats found themselves in. The animals, characters, and even the water all look incredible and the attention to detail is not something that can be overlooked. Every move Luffy does, the way the earth moves and even the very clouds and wind are done to well that it alone can give the film a five star rating.

As you can see however, I have not given this film a five star rating though. The plot itself is littered with holes, even though it is wildly enjoyable. I had followed the hype for the film before it was released in Japan, and the trailers all showed the big shot pirate gangs in them. Here, we barely get to see any, and the references to the time of the Pirate King Gol D. Roger, while pleasant, are merely there as fanservice really. (There was a oneshot in Shonen Jump that gave more backstory to the Golden Lion and the Pirate King, but for spoiler sake i'll stop there.) While it's mostly save the damsel in distress, many of the Straw Hats are more than capable of taking care of themselves, so really this film is just to see Luffy kick some major ass, along with Zoro and Sanji.

All in all, I really did love this film, I even bought the japanese release, but if you were expecting some of Oda's storytelling, you're much better off buying the Season 4 and Season 5 voyages of the anime. He did help for the film, it just wasn't his best work. Can't blame him though, man rarely takes a break!",1381190400,4,1906,4.363380281690141
5928458,5,B00ENO1LSY,"Honestly, I don't know what to say. Strong World is an amazing movie, but there's only been a sub so far. Now, with the dubbed version coming out, and with the addition of Brook speaking english, I'm ecstatic. One Piece has probably the most intriguing characters, plot, and personalities in ANY anime, manga, cartoon, TV show, or movie. It's one of the best. And Eiichiro Oda, wherever you are, thank you for sticking with it and making time to produce this movie- It's one of the classics.",1378857600,36,491,4.655172413793103
5928459,4,B00ENO1LSY,"i have more of question. Is this movie english dubed? The product looks really good but thier was nothing explaning what languages its in.

5928461,5,B00ENO1LSY,I'm working my way through One Piece Anime and Movies in the order they came out. I finally saw this movie and LOOOOVED IT! Watching it the blu ray on a big screen DVD is AWESOME. =),1491350400,2,182,3.945945945945946

5928463,5,B00ENO1LSY,"I've seen pictures revolving around this movie of One Piece, but I never thought I would find it until the time of purchase.  Since it wasn't available for streaming, I was so happy to have the chance to buy it.  I'm not sure how far back this was before the time skip, but to have the whole gang together on one of their last adventures before the time skip just brought a smile to my face.  It's hard to say which version is better (dubbed or subbed), since the voice acting for both is top notch.  It is worth watching, and owning.  I highly recommend it.",1486166400,2,558,4.226415094339623

5928475,5,B00ENO1LSY,"Oh man, where to begin?! I've been wanting to watch this movie for such a long time, I felt pretty dumb once I had realized I could buy it on amazon! And as a DVD/Blu Ray combo, and with both Japanese audio w/English Sub, and English Dub version as well!!!! The movie was so good I had to watch both versions! Though I gotta say I actually enjoyed the Japanese with English subtitles better.  But that's only because I'm more used to the Japanese character voices, so the English Dub voices sounded weird at first until I got a little used to them. Definitely would recommend this movie to any and all One Piece fans! Sorry I didn't say much about the story, but I don't want to spoil anything :D",1462665600,4,696,4.312977099236641

5928483,1,B00ENO1LSY,"Many good reviews out there, but as a One Piece fan of the past, I couldn't agree.  Anime's evolve in film, but I thought the art and directing were too similar to the series, which would be great, except that the series is so repetitive now it's hard to watch.  Most characters are exactly the same from the first episode, still using the exact same lines with zero character development.  This film is a little more colorful, but not enough from repeated plots and predictable endings.

I'm not loving the new additions to the crew, whenever a new crew member is introduced, and old member gets put to the side.  What happened to Nico Robin?  She has no emotion and only has the most minimum of lines.  I remember her for her first story appearance,  she was tough, now she just likes to read, all the time, throughout the episode/movie, forever.  She no longer has a personality, they might as well have let her go during the Franky arc.  Each character still has one exaggerated personality trait which never changes.

To me, it feels like the series sold out already, which of course after so many years, something had to give.  What happened to Nami?  She seemed to have had breast augmentation to what triple D and is only drawn/represented in the shortest, skimpiest, outfits with up close camera shots of her butt and breast?  You'll get up close shots of huge, bouncy breasts.  Really?  She now says thank you for everything in the sweetest possible way, what happened with the direction of this character?  What's up with the outfit changes, most are just dumb and hard to look at.  At one point in the story the entire crew changes into an entire new wardrobe, only for a few minutes, then get into a fight, yes, hard to believe, a fight and there goes the costume change.  It's just lame.  Why was this called Strong World again, and what's up with the lousy hats.  It was hard to watch this movie, nothing in this film pushed the series forward.",1451779200,,1959,4.555873925501433

5928514,5,B00ENO1LSY,"I asked for this as a Xmas gift, after careful consideration (because some reviews seemed to portray it as a Nami in distress film where she stays a prisoner the whole time worrying about her friends).  However, after watching it I realized that it wasn't true at all.  It was a typical One Piece adventure.  Yes, Nami is kidnapped in the beginning, but she quickly sets about freeing herself and rejoining her friends, but it's an uphill battle with many twists and turns.  The real story is about battling a legendary pirate who plans on destroying the entire East Blue, which he says is the weakest of the four Blues (as well as the islands he's stolen with the innocent people there) as a way to terrorize the rest of the world into submission.  He's a cruel, sadistic bully and quite worth being pummelled by the Straw Hats.  Definitely worth it to any One Piece fans.",1420588800,,873,4.564102564102564

5928519,5,B00ENO1LSY,"This is an awesome movie for any One Piece fan. It looks excellent in blu-ray format. The voice acting is superb. If you are not a fan of the English dubbing, you have the option to select the original japanese with English subtitles ( which I prefer)  but either way it is top notch. The story is fun and exciting. I just wish certain characters got a little more screen time. This particular story takes place right after the thriller bark arc, so if you haven't seen that yet, there may be a few spoilers. The main villain is pretty cool, but not my all-time favorite. Either way, it's definitely worth purchasing since it is canon.",1414886400,4,635,4.474137931034483

5928525,3,B00ENO1LSY,This is not my favorite anime. I read several user reviews that were mostly good so I bought it. I guess my taste in anime is different than the reviewers on amazon store.

5928527,3,B00ENO1LSY,"The Blu-Ray quality is stellar; unfortunately, the movie itself doesn't quite match it, thus the 3 stars. The first half is a lot of fun to watch, if a bit directionless, but the second half begins to meander so much that, despite being a huge One Piece fan, I was ready for it to end before it even reached the final battle. (A lot of the second half watches like a cobbled-together-if-well-animated series of mini-episodes, with each main character getting their own highlight battle, etc. This sort of structure would have worked - and has worked - in the TV series and manga, but a movie doesn't have time for that.) Several plot elements also seem recycled from previous story arcs in the series, which was frustrating. Still, for One Piece fans, it's worth the purchase just to experience the ridiculous monsters and animation. I just wish the pacing had been better.",1409097600,,873,4.75

The sixth movie and Z are my favorites but only because Luffy shouldn't have been able to contend with Shiki. This guy fought with Rodger and the top of the marines.

5928539,5,B00ENO1LSY,"For any one who is fan of the One Piece Franchise is definitely going to love and enjoy it and love the fact the creator of One Piece himself was not just involved in the project, but wrote and hand drawn some of the parts of the movie as well. It's definitely worth watching and your moneys worth. You will not be disappointed.",1401840000,,328,4.222222222222222
5928540,5,B00ENO1LSY,"This movie is great. If you love One Piece already, you'll have a blast, like I did, while watching this movie. It has a good story, good albeit short, for the most part, fights, & a great dub. Taking place in between the 1st 2 arcs with Brook, it sees the Strawhat crew going up against Shiki the Golden Lion, who's kidnapped Nami in the plan to have her as his navigator after she predicts a storm that not even his top crew saw coming.

Story: 8/10. The story also sees the Strawhats having to return to the East Blue, after finding out it's in danger of being attacked, then the stuff I mention happens. This film was the 1st personally overseen by the manga's author Eiichiro Oda, so it's most likely canon with the show & it's a great ride all the way through. The fights, while they feel short, are cut in favor of the story of the movie, which is fine with me. It's easy to get into & like, so fans who haven't seen it yet, will be able to get invested in it.

Animation: 10/10. The animation is PHENOMINAL, especially in HD, so DEFINITELY get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack for that & the fact that for some reason it & the DVD version are the exact same price. You'd expect the DVD to be like $5 cheaper than the combo pack, but whatever. We get several costume changes for the Strawhats & some interesting animals. Plus, the last fight looks SPECTACULAR in HD, so look forward to those.

Dub: 10/10. VERY accurate. I watch anime, if available, in the English dub w/ the subtitle track & this movie is VERY accurate to the Japanese. The cast does a great job as their characters & the 5.1 audio mixing softens the voices & better mixes them with the sound effects & music better than on the show, which makes Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy voice more bearable, not that she's not bearable as Luffy, but it makes it better. All of the other actors do their characters like normal & they're great. Scott McNeil does a great Jamaican accent for Shiki, so there you go. I hope they bring him back for the future episode(s) that Shiki shows up in. If you, like me, like watching One Piece dubbed, you won't be disappointed.
Ian Sinclair does a great job as Brook. I've heard him as Dandy in Space Dandy & he sounds nothing like in there, as he does some different things with his Brook voice than Dandy & it's great hearing him as Brook. His singing is also great, not forced, & a bit weird like I've been hearing it should be like in the original Japanese.

Overall, I'd highly recommend this movie if you are a One Piece fan & want to see it in HD, with a great dub & also great packaging, which matches up with the Collection sets very nicely on the shelf.",1401580800,2,2658,4.31

5928549,5,B00ENO1LSY,"I will start off this review by saying that I was not a One Piece fan before this movie. Which sounds a little odd and will probably throw a lot of the hard core fans into a tail spin upon finding out that I watched this movie before watching even a single episode of the TV Series (except for a few of the 4Kids dub which we will not speak of.)

Still, even with little knowledge about the in depth details, I had researched enough about the show to get the gist of what was going on, and I can assure anyone who might be weary that this movie is one hell of a fun ride no matter if you have seen the series or not. Granted, this isn't exactly a great place to start, but for anyone who wishes to get a little dose of One Piece without setting aside a few weeks to watch all 600+ episodes, this should give you the perfect feel on if the series is for you or not.

Having the privilege to be penned by the original Manga-ka, this lovely little adventure with the Straw Hats is very much One Piece in it's element. Extremely quirky characters, a big fun adventure, and a little bit of heart to tug at your emotions by movie's end. If it sounds like I am rambling it's most likely because I am still just so excited about this movie. I loved every second of it and it truly did turn me into a One Piece fan.

While not a masterpiece by any means, this movie is a great way to pass some time and fall in love with the characters, I highly recommend it to anyone who is still on the fence about whether to get into the show or not.",1395619200,6,1528,4.019736842105263

The dub in this film is excellent, and the special feature is a lot of fun, introducing Ian Sinclair to the crew.

5928560,4,B00ENO1LSY,"After five years and over 300 episodes worth of uncut DVDs, FUNimations has finally given attention to another 'One Piece' movie. The film is fairly stand alone and I imagine fairly assessable to newcomers to the series; although if you who haven't seen the Thriller bark episodes (i.e. Season six) yet, there are some obvious spoilers for those episodes (that are even on the cover).
If you're not familiar with 'One Piece', the series follows Money D Luffy, a pirate who ate the legendary gum-gum devil fruit and gained the abilities of rubber; He and his misfit crew, the Straw Hat pirates, travel the across the treacherous Grand Line seas in search of Pirate King Gold Roger's greatest treasure: the One Piece.
Of the twelve One Piece films, 'Strong World' has the milestone of being the first film to have heavy involvement from One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda, and shows a lot more ambition than the Straw hat's  previous theatrical outings.

During a freak weather storm, the Straw Hats encounter Golden Lion Shiki, a former rival of Gold Roger, and save his ship from hitting a deadly cyclone. He returns the favor by kidnapping Nami, their skilled navigator. As they invade Shiki's base, located on a series of floating islands, they must battle deadly and weird super-evolved animals and discover Shiki's plan to destroy their home, the East Blue seas.
'Strong World' has a surprisingly strong emotional center to it. The film mostly focuses on Nami' relationship with the crew, exploring her faith in them and her fear that the rest of the crew will be killed rescuing her. This works well in the context of a stand alone film, and excellently portrays the character based drama that is one of 'One Piece's biggest strengths, but the particular story arc here felt re-hashed. Nami and Shiki's scenes together are somewhat reminiscent of her scenes with Eneru in the manga/series, and the emotional climax of the film is almost identical to what Robin went through in Enies Lobby. Taken alongside the series, this is the second time (after Arlong Park) where Nami has gone through this character arc.
Most of the other straw hats do get moments in the spotlight, but everyone outside of Luffy and Nami are essentially relegated to supporting characters. There's noting really wrong with that in a film about nine pirates but only 115 minutes of runtime to fill, but fans of Robin, Franky and Brook might feel a bit disappointed at the comparatively little screentime given to their favorite characters. In both languages, the usual cast do a brilliant job of conveying both the quirky and more relatable elements of the Straw Hats, and for dub fans this release premiers Ian Sinclair as the voice of Brook (the aforementioned spoiler).
Shiki is an adequate villain, but honestly I found him to be pretty forgettable. His standard One Piece villain oddball moments fall flat and his actual villainous side just seemed generic. If anything the hype around this character, and his backstory of being on par with Gold Roger, just made Luffy's actual confrontation with him disappointingly anticlimatic. Naoto Takenaka's Japanese performance similarly just seems like a generic deep voiced bad guy. I was initially skeptical about Scott McNeil's accent in the English dub, but was pleasantly surprised that it actually made him a lot more memorable while his performance is still intimidating and sinister when it should be.
This film offers some fantastic visuals with its bizarre and eye popping animal designs, striking use of color during the climax, and the fluid and exciting action sequences. Unfortunately the fights themselves are way too short for an action heavy franchise like 'One Piece', but what is here is some of the best animation the series has yet to offer.

'Strong World' is presented on blu-ray in 1080p with both English and Japanese DTS HD 5.1 master audio tracks and both full and sign-only (for dub viewers) subtitles. The video looked slightly softer than I was expecting and there is some annoying moments of banding, however color and detail are presented as well as I could have hoped for. It's nothing exceptional, but the blu-ray version is a solid transfer, and is leagues ahead of its DVD counterpart. Unfortunatly the ending credits theme music, 'Fanfare' by Mr Children, isn't included in this version due to licensing problems. The replacement music is an odd choice, pairing dramatic and tense music with the lighthearted visuals.

The only substantial extra is 'Behind The Scenes: Introducing Brook' (20 minutes), which includes interviews with Ian Sinclair (Brook), Mike Mcfarland (Voice Director), Brina Palencia (Chopper) and some cosplayers, who discuss what makes Brook a unique character (more Thriller Bark arc spoilers lurk here). There is also the US Trailer for 'Strong World' and trailers for other FUNimation releases.

Strong World does a good job of selecting the best elements of One Piece, but isn't always so successful in cramming them into a single film, with a few elements feeling like the writers were just going through the motions. That being said, it is a better transition than most anime film spin offs of the same vein. While it doesn't quite reach the same level as the manga or TV series, the film still offers plenty to like for fans of the  franchise and provides a solid representation of the show for anyone new to the series. Hopefully FUNimation will release another one of the One Piece movies before 2018.",1389571200,7,5488,4.992349726775957

5928563,4,B00ENO1LSY,I really enjoyed this movie and the movie alone would have gotten five stars but I did not like how the Blu-ray copy of this movie had bad sound. For example: sometimes during the action parts of the movie the characters' voices would get really quiet and i would have to turn up the volume for just that part and turn it back down when the music started playing again. Luckily the DVD copy did not have this problem. I don't know if it was just my Blu-ray copy but it should be something to consider if you only have a blu-ray player.,1388966400,,535,4.203883495145631

5928567,4,B00ENO1LSY,"Strong world was written and overseen by One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda. Thus it is of much higher quality story telling than the other one piece movies and fits the tone of the series much better. The animation is fantastic, the storyline is great, and any fan of One Piece should see this. Though if you aren't caught up one the series (through Thriller Bark) there might be a couple of small spoilers. My only gripes with it, are the voice actors for Shiki and Indigo. They do a great job in matching the tone and feel of the characters, but their dialog can sometimes be hard to understand (this is One Piece, there are some really outlandish characters in it). The only other problem I had is that I wish it was longer, because a few parts feel rushed, but that's because it is a movie. Overall loved the movie itself, and if you are a person who thinks they would like One Piece, but don't want to sit though hundreds upon hundreds of episodes, than this is the film for you.

Side note: I wish funimation had translated the credits from Japanese to English but there was probably some licensing issue. Oh well.",1388275200,2,1117,4.4487804878048784
