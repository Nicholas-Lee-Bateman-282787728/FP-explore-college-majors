8231706,5,B000YB81GA,"This is a spanish foreign film, a black comedy which is an exploding pressure cooker of hilarity and coincidence.  I watched it all in subtitles and loved every minute.

Do you remember that scene in Little Miss Sunshine where the family packs up the grandpa in the hospital sheets and steals him out?  This movie is alot like that.  The characters are true, human, and their reactions to the bizarre circumstances make you fall in love  with them.  In every scene we know the characters intent, and watch them throw themselves in wholeheartedly, trying to fix their individual dilemmas once and for all.  They behave zanily, ingeniously, irrationality left at the foot of the door they just sprinted out of.  It is a race of hilarity to see who can track down the deceased grandpa, moving from scene to scene in and out of clothes, fridges, trashcans, the morgue, the dissection room, cars, and the minds and memories of his loved ones.

The movie highlights three major characters.  One) the father who runs the funeraria; he must get the grandpa's body or he cannot back up business with his partners in illegal high paying crime.
two) his daughter, an outcast, disgusted by the family business but unaware of the delicate details surrounding her dad's work
three) the deceased grandfathers grandson, a cute, quirky boy who has to own up to his father but tries not to have to, by never admitting there is a problem.  He must do everything himself, but in the midst of all this chaos, runs into a true crush with the daughter of the funeraria owner. The friendship and love that grows between them is adorable and memorable, for their embarrassing inexperience but also for how fitting and perfectly sweet a couple they are.

You can't help but love this movie, is the simple resolution to this review.",1229472000,3,1805,4.75
