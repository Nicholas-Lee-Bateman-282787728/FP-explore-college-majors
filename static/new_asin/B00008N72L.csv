7985968,5,B00008N72L,"Mann is the Bollywood remake of ""An Affair to Remember"". In this movie, I found Aamir Khan convincing whether he was portraying his character as the devil-may-care lothario (in the similar way as he did at the start of Dil Chanti Hai), and I was equally convinced that those resounding moments morphed his character to the sweet-lover-in-love and romantic painter. This movie, even with its many over-the-top awesomely-cheesy scenes, is quite the tear-jerker, as anyone who has seen An Affair to Remember would expect. Of course, our hero, Aamir, has plenty of his own tears to shed and does not disappoint those of us who love to see him cry. This is a must see for romance-movie lovers and Aamir Khan fans alike.",1445904000,,714,4.813008130081301

7985970,3,B00008N72L,"This got off to a slow start. We have playboy Aamir Khan being extremely irritating as the egoist (strangely he can do that very effectively as he has elsewhere!) to the point where my 28 year old co-viewer abandoned it.
As he began to really fall love and redeem himself the movie settled down into an average to slightly above average romance. The couple are both individually off to meet their fiancees but vow to set things right and meet in 6 months if they still want to be together. Events transpire so that one can't make it....
There is some OK dancing, nothing standout in the songs but they were OK. I didn't feel the chemistry between Aamir and Manisha Koirala was as convincing as he has been with others. OK movie and will stand the test of whether I hang onto it but not in my favorites group. Movie wquality is acceptable given its age (1999).
Elsewhere on the Net it seems to rate mostly as a 6 out of 10.",1236816000,,922,4.335260115606936
7985971,5,B00008N72L,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie (though both of us do not speak Urdu fluently; does contain translation). Recommend it to anyone who likes a good romantic movie. Characters are well portrayed and give the movie life.  As for the traditional music skit every so often,they are still here but at the end of the movie that does not stand out at all.  Great story great directing wonderful,amazing,great ending!  A must see!",1221782400,,428,4.756756756756757
