8437555,5,B004P8R9SY,"A well-paced, action packed, fun filled comedy drama starring William ""Hoppy"" Boyd? I'm onboard!
Suicide Fleet, an RKO Pathe production filmed in 1931, has been beautifully remastered on this DVD version by Warner Archive. Hopefully, they will remaster and release more great movies like this on DVD, such as Carnival Boat, which also stars William Boyd and Ginger Rogers.
There is some great filmography here in Suicide Fleet, which is enhanced by the restoration. The plot is very interesting and you can tell this film wasn't on a budget level, as there are several scenes that have that ""wow"" factor. A couple of shadowed/highlighted scenes were also caught beautifully on camera.
If you're interested in this film because it's a
WW1 movie, or if you love 1930s films, you can't go wrong. But of you're a fan of Ginger Rogers and/or William Boyd, you will absolutely love it! Highly recommended!",1466380800,4,899,5.0
8437556,4,B004P8R9SY,"William ""Bill"" Boyd is one of my very favorite all time actors, so if I'm a bit prejudiced about his films you'll understand why. Boyd, along with Gleason and Armstrong are a comic threesome all with one girl in mind --  Sally, played by Ginger Rogers.  It's a funny, well paced movie  that  gives a good view of an older merchant ship. And I just love happy endings!",1426118400,4,367,4.352941176470588
