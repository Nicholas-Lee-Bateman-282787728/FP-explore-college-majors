628603,2,6303320546,"What is wrong with this video:

1)Miss Christy is in dire need of a hair band.  She fiddles with her hair to DISTRACTION.
2)  The video is annoying because it is not a mirror representation of the steps.  Meaning... when she says start on the right foot she ALSO starts on the right foot.  To the viewer it looks like the LEFT foot.  When you are trying to follow along and make sure you have the changes right this little flaw becomes very obvious and impedes learning.  You COULD start out on the left foot, but that goes against the real world.
3)  The tape is too short and there is next to NO warm up.
4)  The children in the video are either well beyond the tape's skills and seem to want to show off or they are tots that lack coordination.  Nowhere in between.  For adult, the way she talks can be grating and condescending.  This is the least of the tapes problems and I mention it only in a passing way.
This is a waste of money.",1031529600,26,939,4.155555555555556
628604,4,6303320546,"This instuctional video was done very tastefully. What I did find is that the movie proclaims to  appeal to both children and teenagers (Age Range was 7 to 16 years old).  I feel this tape is better suited for the younger  children. The instructor is outstanding, however, you would need a lot of  patience to work with the younger children.  The teacher does her best to  make sure that each student receives individual attention.  She handles the  teen classes the same way, except,  she only took the extra time with those  who are having a tough time.  Overall, I feel that the age range being to  broad will hinder the older students.  So this tape is a mix, it appeals to  the younger generation but falls short of its goal to assist teens, which  in turn will make the teen dancers board.  I was very impressed by how neat  and clean every student was dressed neatly.  Sometimes the students come to  class without combing their,  they have ripped and soiled tights.",943574400,10,973,4.578947368421052

7844102,4,6303320546,"I bought this for my daughter when she started dance class, and it quickly moves beyond the level her Ballet/Tap class reaches, into combinations which are actually pretty difficult. Having said that, she enjoys dancing along with the DVD, even though she's nowhere close to doing the moves, and I've had a lot of fun dancing with her, and have noticed that doing all the moves is quite a workout. I suspect there are better instructional DVDs out there for kids, but this one is about the right pace for this mid-30s mom :)",1248998400,,524,4.585106382978723
7844103,5,6303320546,"As an adult, I enrolled in a jazz class, not really knowing much about it. After the first class, I realized that I needed to learn more about jazz steps. I ordered this video and found it extremely helpful. The video follows the structure of a real dance class with beginning stretches,floor exercises then center work. Miss Christy's directions are easy to follow and the energy of her young dancers is contagious. My 9 year old daughter is also having fun with the video which we have done over and over again.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking to learn basic jazz steps",1105920000,6,575,4.58252427184466
7844104,4,6303320546,"This video has 3 different sections, jazz, tap, and ballet.  It doesn't really show you exactly how to do too many of the steps or positions, it gives kids an idea of what goes on in a children's dance class.  I think it also, unfortunately, gives the impression that you go to a class or two and then you can do the combination at the end of the sections.  My Kindergarten-aged daughter does, however, like to try some of the moves (especially ballet) along with  the dvd. For anyone looking for detailed instruction, this isn't it.  But, for fun and maybe some introduction to dance, it is fine.",1101254400,49,597,4.4907407407407405
7844105,4,6303320546,"I have been buying videos to help teach kids to dance and this one is by far the best.  Miss Christy demonstrates and explains each step clearly, and, as an added bonus, a small box often appears on the lower right showing a close-up of her feet.  There are more than enough steps to keep children busy for months.  The children in the video range from young and not very good, to older and polished.  The child watching the video can feel that he or she fits right in.  I like the demo at the end and particularly appreciate that is shows *boys* having fun dancing.  The biggest drawback is that Miss Christy doesn't go to her left, our right, when she says to start on the right.  Most teachers do.  Finally, even though this video is for kids, a beginning adult could learn a lot from it (although an adult might feel that the video is too short).  All together, I think it's well organized, very clear, and a great buy.",1044662400,14,923,4.319767441860465
