I have enjoyed Hans Zimmer's work on a number of movies and Jordi Savall is an excellent artist (I have many of his albums). Together they provide a very interesting musical narrative. For me, there is nothing worse than a period drama with irrelevant sounds attached. I thoroughly enjoyed Henri 4. I had no problem with the subtitles.",1412208000,5,402,4.840579710144928
8416453,3,B004529NIO,Not quite what I expected.  I expected a more historical view of the history of Henri.  this was not quite what I wanted.  But it is probably ok for those that are looking for something else.,1397347200,,191,4.25
8416454,4,B004529NIO,"The DVD came quickly, so I would recommend the seller.
As for the movie, I enjoyed most of it.  However, there were so many historical inaccuracies.  But I knew I was not watching a documentary, so I could ignore them. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the time period.",1374710400,5,287,4.39622641509434
