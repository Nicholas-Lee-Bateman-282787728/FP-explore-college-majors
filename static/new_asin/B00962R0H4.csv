5272394,5,B00962R0H4,"Mannix has survived the test of time.  This series is well worth the purchase.  I bought each year as they were released.  I'm waiting on the final #8 now to be shipped to me.
This heroic Detective series is very special.  The finest TV actor ever Mike Connors, portrays MANNIX beautifully.  His character is brave, honest and devoted to his friends and clients. And this series was filmed in a high quality that looks great on today's TV's.
And no series can top the theme music of Mannix.  I am a huge fan and I am so glad this series is available.  None are better.",1353974400,63,568,4.352380952380952
5272425,5,B00962R0H4,"I LOVE Mannix!  I found this series last year- I didi not see Mannix when it played in the late sixtes and seventies, but I have the complete series now, and I watch it every night on MeTV.  The show is exciting and fun to watch; Mike Connors is wonderful as Mannix, as is Gail Fisher as Peggy Fare.  It's too bad the series was stopped after 8 seasons.  If you haven't see Mine Connors on Perry Mason, check it out- it's a really good episode.  Ward Wood is also great as LT. Art Malcom.  Its fun to see how cars, homes, and decorations looked during that era.  I love the show and will soooo sad when it leaves MeTV.",1518134400,,618,4.1

5272465,5,B00962R0H4,"Once again the best bet this week is the release of a complete series on disc for a reasonable price and size that won't fill your shelf. This time around we return to the sixties and seventies with a private eye that took the country by storm, breaking down at least one barrier of the time and lasting 8 seasons, all collected here. The show and the main character was named MANNIX.

Starring Mike Connors (who just passed away this last year) as Joe Mannix, the show focused on a detective in the old school tradition. The first season had Mannix working for a high tech computerized private detective agency called Intertech. Run by Lew Wickersham (Joseph Campanella), the agency used computers to siphon through data to find their man. Mannix instead chose to follow his gut instinct, walk the streets and often take a beating in pursuit of the truth. The only reason Wickersham keeps him on is that he gets results, sometimes even when the computers think otherwise.

Viewers weren't as keen on this format as was thought and with the second season Mannix went into business for himself. One of the first changes was to hire a girl Friday, someone to take calls and run the office. This part was filled by Gail Fisher as Peggy Fair and a more loyal employee would be hard to find. Most notable about this role was that Fisher was one of the first black actresses to star in a major role in regular television at the time. Several other recurring characters were added to assist Mannix, most working for the police force.

The format of the show was usually the same, a situation which required Mannix to mount his white steed and go forward into the fray to save whoever was in need. He was not just a detective but a hero as well, following his own personal strict code of honor in an attempt to discover the truth. This also made the show different from most at the time. Rather than a series that revolved around the story being told it was character driven, as much about Mannix and those who hired him as it was the situation he was handling.

Another thing that made the show different was that Mannix wasn't infallible. He often found himself on the wrong end of a physical confrontation being beaten by the bad guys as often as he dished it out. During the time the series was on the air Mannix was knocked unconscious dozens of times and shot and wounded at least 10 times. He was cool, he was intelligent and even though he could handle himself in a fight those fights were more realistic than most on TV since he didn't always win.

Running from 1967 through 1975 the series was not known for being topical and yet it did touch on subjects in the news. A Korean War veteran, Mannix dealt with repercussions from his time in the service. Topics like handicapped characters who helped in spite of their disabilities, racism and the effects of PTSD on returning Vietnam vets were included in various episodes.

So now you know what the series was about if you weren't beforehand. Also note that it featured one of the best TV series theme songs composed by the great Lalo Schifrin. But whats in this box set? And why this rather than the separate seasons already released?

To answer that last question the size. This box set will take up far less room on the shelf. The price when compared to buying each season separately is a savings worth taking advantage of. And the extras are nice worth taking the time to enjoy. They include: Interviews with Mike Connors and Joseph Campanella, Mike Connors on THE MIKE DOUGLAS SHOW, TV Land promos, a DIAGNOSIS MURDER clip (his character returned for a part in an episode of that series), audio commentary on the pilot by co-creator William Link, audio commentary on Another Final Exit by Connors and Campanella, Mike Connors audio introductions on the episodes and a photo gallery. If the name William Link sounds familiar it should. In addition to creating this series with co-creator Richard Levinson the duo created COLUMBO.

So here you have it, all 194 episodes contained on 48 discs, 163 hours and 44 minutes of pure Mannix. Fans of sixties TV will find this a must have for their collection. If you don't add it to yours hopefully youll find someone who did to borrow it from. In going back and revisiting the series I found that they were as enjoyable today as when first viewed long ago. Take a trip back in time with MANNIX.",1494892800,8,4391,4.570520965692503

5272469,5,B00962R0H4,"This set is awesome, I have watched the first 5 episodes of Mannix, so far, the phone has been used 18 times, two car crashes in one episode, Joe has been bashed in the head 12 times, a babe in every episode. I am waiting for the first brake line cut going down hill crash, you would think Joe would check his brakes after the first time, but no! My favorite car Joe drove was the 1970 Cuda, after he wreaked that, his ride was a chevy caprice 4 door, NO JOE, NO!

5272471,5,B00962R0H4,"Mannix is a great action detective series! It was the template for many other shows to come, but the original still puts them to shame. I was surprised a how many stories predated similar 70's detective films. Mannix delivering a bag of ransom money for a female hostage, while being watched thru the scope of a sniper rifle, reminded me of Dirty Harry; which came out 4 or 5 years later. I know that all of these detective shows have much earlier film noir inspirations, it's just surprising to see how well the stories, action & acting hold up in the new millennium.",1492992000,6,568,4.524271844660194

5272473,1,B00962R0H4,I would love to buy this set. But I won't. They keep churning out DVDs like bluray doesn't exist. If you're trying to end physical copies you're going to die homeless & broke. I don't buy downloads bc I don't want to have to rely on the internet to watch what I want. And I'm certainly not going backward in format. Give us Bluray!,1491264000,,331,4.1875

(I like the fact that he was married to the same woman since 1949. Wow! That says a lot!) I've seen all but the last season on DVD, and they've all been good quality, good sound and good color, and--it goes without saying--good entertainment.

5272513,5,B00962R0H4,"My dad's favorite show, and I see why. The first season is a little gimicky with the computers and space-age methods (which Mannix frequently upstaged) but it turns out Connors' portrayal was strong enough as the hook.  So by the beginning of the second season he's a regular private eye.  Mannix is very much a product of its time, which is no criticism.  The episodes swing from lengthy monologues to violent action and back again.  The body count has been described as ""appalling"" and by Washington Post's count Mannix himself was shot 17 times and knocked unconscious 55 times during the show's run.

The Post wrote: ""Mannix was the last of a certain type of American manhood, circa early '70s. He wore a tie and a wistful smile. He did not know doubt but was a friend of irony. He didn't worry about giving women ""their space,"" and he wasn't ""in touch with his feelings."" He was kind to small dogs, little old ladies, and femmes fatales in deep trouble and short skirts.  He drove too fast, drank too much and smoked like he got paid for it. He slugged people and shot guys and never got pulled in by the cops.""

I was 10 years old mid-way through the show's run, and Joe Mannix was exactly the kind of guy I wanted to be.",1459036800,36,1227,4.426666666666667
5272514,5,B00962R0H4,"The Good: Packaging
Individual cases for each season means that chances are good that the plastic that holds the inner disks stays in place for a while.

The Bad:
On Season 5 discs (so far) the non-voice tracks are much louder than on the first four seasons. This is a little annoying because I end up turning the volume down whenever there is a lot of shooting, car chases or beginning/ending credits, and of course Mannix gets shot at a lot. I haven't verified if this is a problem on Seasons 6 through 8 as I haven't watched those episodes yet.

Overall:
The release was digitally remastered which is much better than original and syndicated broadcasts from the 60's through early 2000's. It's time consuming to do it this way but its worth every penny. The scenes play well on an old analog TV set and look good enough on a 720p HDTV set. I haven't tried playing the series on a 1080p set yet. With the exception of the Season 5 sound issues for gun shots, chase scenes and beginning/ending credits the discs have been wonderful to watch. The intro on Season 1 by Mike Conners and Joe Campanella were a nice touch. Each episode is roughly 50 minutes in length.

Looking forward to watching Seasons 6, 7 and 8",1458950400,5,1212,4.475113122171946

When Amazon made it available at under seventy-five dollars I jumped on it and gave it to hubby as a Christmas present.  He was ecstatic!  One of my best gift's to date.  I'm watching an episode right now (it's on pause as I type this review).  Sexy Mannix.  Handsome as all get out.  Sharp dresser.  Not a hair out of place, until he gets in a fight or somebody knocks him in the head, lol.  What a man, What a man, what a man, what a mighty good man!!!  Bad to the bone!!!

Lots of action and violence, yet Mannix was a moral constant during the late '60's and early '70's cultural upheavals.  Worth a look.",1402876800,4,419,4.608108108108108

5272547,5,B00962R0H4,"Being a Fresno resident since 1980, have to first acknowledge Mike Connors as being from the Central Valley.

Now...on with the show. With writing/directing by Bruce Geller of Mission Impossible fame, you have a good cornerstone to build a series on. Running from fall 1967 to spring 1975, this was one of my prime-time musts during adolescent years. Its been great recently with the boxed sets and Hulu Plus to revisit shows from my youth. But to see these shows in DVD quality when we didn't get color TV until August 1971 is one of the best aspects. And I'm an admittedly rabid car guy, and so I'm constantly checking out the wheels. Joe had my favorites. Gail Fisher as his faithful secretary (coffee, Joe?) was one of the earlier African-American regular characters on primetime, and I LOVED her. Joe got ambushed and got his butt kicked quite often, and some of his sport coats definitely earned their own museum, but compelling stories with lots of good plot twists and lots of good action made this a staple. Enjoying these very much--worth having in my opinion.",1396224000,5,1070,4.752688172043011

5272553,5,B00962R0H4,"I've written reviews for seasons 4, 5, 6, and 7 of this series.  I've also written extensively about this series on the ""Mannix is Coming!"" thread of the Home Theatre Forum.

This series is special.

It carries all sorts of labels, like ""one of the most violent,"" that are simply absurd, especially by today's standards of the way violence is used in story as pure shock value -- not as something that fuels the hero's response  We lose something important when we forget that violence in story goes back to fairy tales, and seems to be an essential part of working out some of the more fundamental stuff of life, like the importance of storied heroism in becoming a good individual.  Cultures with violence in story tend to not be violent -- everything depends upon the way the violence fuels the story, the way the hero responds to it.

This series does it right and like no other.  It hits a sweet spot that has not been hit since it left the air.

Joe Mannix is a classic hero.  The more I study this, the more I believe he is one of the best constructed hero motifs to appear in story.  He adds an element of vulnerability to his larger than life exploits.  He gets hurt a lot.  He isn't perfect.  He keeps going.  He fights the good fight.  His heart is always in the right place.  He is often described as the toughest PI on television.  That is true.  But, he also adds emotion to the mix.

If that sounds good on paper, it is even better on screen.

This is a series where the actor embodied the character as an alter ego (something observed at the time in numerous articles) and production qualities were at their very best -- from a production company that was known for not cutting corners during the golden age of television.

I know of no other series where the main character was such an important part of each episode that there was hardly any supporting cast, the episodes included a mix of physical action, location shots, emotional response and close-ups, and the series lasted for so long -- eight full seasons.  And the series was back in the top 20 when it was canceled in its final season -- still going strong.

There will never be another Mannix.  But, we would be better off if there was.  Even better, just buy the DVDs.

Even just a few more people out there inspired by the likes of Joe Mannix just might do us some good.",1391299200,12,2350,4.3944315545243615

I remember some of the episodes from the second season, and watched some of these from a distant TV station when they were blacked out or pre-empted from our local CBS affiliate. This was the summer of a peak in sunspot activity, and one of my hobbies was to experiment with TV reception. I was able to pull a station in from North Platte, NE to here in Northern CA and actually got the week's episode a couple hours earlier that the airtime would have been here.  This was one episode I remembered where Mannix was up in a helicopter and spotted a man and woman struggling on a balcony, and no one believed him.
Picture quality and sound on these is first rate. The remastering makes these look pretty close to BluRay. The sound sometimes seems as if it were done in stereo, possibly they had a stereo track that was on the master that was not used in the days of the original airing.

What a difference a couple of decades make! After a few episodes I was left astounded at the quality of writing, acting, and cinematography. It was a pleasure to see the guest stars. The fourth episode of the first season had scenes in a coffee house, featuring Neil Diamond as the entertainment! Mike Connors is wonderful and compelling in the lead. No metrosexual he, in the same episode that featured Neil Diamond Mike Connors worked undercover as a car mechanic and actually fixed cars! He leapt tall buildings. He had a way with a gun. It is also delightful that this show was written in pre-politically correct days. Unrepentant Nazis were bad guys, thieves were bad guys; today's bad guys are all armed forces service members, business owners, ministers.

You also do not see each plot point coming; each episode still has the power to surprise.

It is also a joy to see outdoor scenery, filmed in real deserts and zoos (not computer generated deserts and zoos or cheap, artificial sets).

Another remarkable feature is that the detective agency Mannix works for is a very early-on technology user. Computers were the size of closets in those days, full of blinking lights.

Mike Connors introduces each episode in audio. I would recommend this to anyone in search of an excellent viewing experience, and not just the predictable, politically correct white noise that most of today's shows resemble.",1361923200,145,1496,4.920634920634921

What a treat to watch all the episodes without interruption. He's tall, dark handsome, smart, athletic, sexy, fearless, romantic, heroic -- yet all too human. I loved his wardrobe, too -- those yummy sport jackets with the colorful linings as well as the women's fashions. Now, of course, Mannix is a period piece and very true to its time. Luxuriate in the late sixties and early seventies. No vulgar language, no sex, but lots of action and romance, too, (in its place). Joe M loved beautiful women -- twice as much if they were in distress. The writing remained consistently good throughout the series -- interesting plots, wonderful California landscapes. Endless twisting highways -- which seemed to be always without traffic when Joe was on the road. Around Season 6, I begin to worry about Joe's continuous bumps on the head from which he always miraculously recovered. Great genes apparently, since Mike Connors lived to be 92 and married to only ONE woman. I was never bored with Mannix.",1530576000,,1124,4.921052631578948
8536492,4,B00962R0H4,Good quality picture and sound. Nice packaging. Fast delivery. My Mom and I are really enjoying watching a WHO DONE IT show without a lot of blood and guts.,1528502400,,156,4.413793103448276
8536493,5,B00962R0H4,"Great packaging.  Nice to have all eight seasons.  This was on all four of my High School years, and a few years prior and after, so amazing memories... I remembered the theme music right away, but the plots are largely forgotten so it's almost like seeing it for the first time save for the firm memories of Joe and Peggy.  If you're in the mood for one of the best '60s/'70s private eye series, get this.",1525219200,,406,4.315789473684211
8536494,3,B00962R0H4,We are still watching all the episodes because there are so many. We love the dvds but we have come across 1 dvd that won't work in 1 episode. It is sad to say we watched till almost the end of episode and we don't know how it ends because it completely stops. We still have many to watch so I will post if we find another. We are a little disappointed.,1524787200,,353,3.9166666666666665
8536495,1,B00962R0H4,"So far the videos are fine.  HOWEVER, the cases are absolutely, cheap garbage.  There are two cases inside, of which both are of cheap plastic broken everywhere.  If you don't mind buying new holders, or maybe don't mind the mess, it's fine.",1523923200,2,241,4.690476190476191
