2456419,5,B000CCD0GW,"I have 10 of the ""Best of...on SNL"" and David Spade's is definitely in my top three favorites.  Lots of ""Spade in America"" skits which are my favorite.  Especially the one with him playing Teri Hatcher and Teri Hatcher playing him.  Definitely a must-buy!",1155772800,,255,4.75
2456420,3,B000CCD0GW,"[...]I specifically have both Will Ferrell Volumes, as well as Best of Farley and Kattan, and now Spade.  While there are always good skits and bad ones, you would think that a DVD with the running time of just over an hour or so can be filled up with the BEST OF somebody's work.  This especially applies to someone who was on SNL for six years like Spade, although his last season only in the Spade in America segments.  Here's a brief skit rundown of this DVD:

1. Martha Stewart skit which is actually one of the best on the DVD, from his guest hosting appearance in 2005 in which Stewart has recently been released from prison.  (Spade as Stewart).

2. Opening Monologue from another guest hosting appearance.

3. A Salon hair ad which is actually pretty funny.

4. Dick Clark Productions skit in which Spade plays an obnoxious secretary who won't let anyone in to see Clark.  Gets old quickly, but Phil Hartman steals the skit as Jesus, at the end.

5. Vin Diesel skit.  This one had it's moments, but was also from his 2005 guest hosting show.

6. Total Bastard Airlines (Buh Buy).  Spade plays an airline steward who is, yes, a bastard, and it's pretty good.

7. Spade plays Tom Petty to Dana Carvey's Bob Dylan.  This was okay, but starts to give you a headache after awhile.

8. Mall Girls skit with Sandler and Farley.  Not real funny in my opinion.

9. Sean Penn Celebrity Roast.  Really not that funny on the whole, but Spade as Owen Wilson and his nose was a saving grace.  I wouldn't call it the ""best of"" though.
...Yet another skit from his 2005 guest host appearance.

10. Spade in America.  Teri Hatcher plays David Spade and Spade plays Hatcher.  They go at each other in one of the best moments of the DVD.

11. PBS Afterschool Special.  Not very funny at all.

12. Update correspondent segment with Chris Farley.  Usually when these two get together, it's very funny.  Not here.

13. Dirtball Burnout Convention.  Spade plays a take on his Joe Dirt character in, yes, you guessed it, another segment from his guest hosting duties in 2005.  The good news here is that this is very funny.  This is one of the best on the DVD.

14. Don Lapre.  This has always been one of my favorite characters.  Actually, this is a real infomercial guy and Spade plays him perfectly.  This is funny, but I've seen better segments with this character.  Once again, this is not the BEST OF this segment.

15. Spade in America.  Gets a tattoo from the real Sean Penn.  An okay bit.

16. Video Store Clerk.  Not real funny, with Jeff Goldblum.

17. Spade in America.  This was his last show as a cast member on SNL. This is a segment where he rips all the new cast members.  Actually funny.  The most amusing part is when they show a picture of Will Ferrell and he says that he basically doesn't know the guy.

18. NCI Commercial.  Not funny.

19. Spade in America.  Christopher Walken sits in for Spade, while Spade is outside in a ""blizzard"" and doesn't know his mic is on...uh, yea.  Again, it has it's moments, but not great.

Okay, so there you go in detail.  The dress sketch is okay and actually better than some of the meat on the feature.  The outtakes are not great either.  Disappointed for the most part, but not horrible.  Just okay.  You might find it interesting that David Spade does do a commentary track and even on that questions why a skit or two is actually on the DVD.  It really shows where this SNL Best of Series is.  I would think that they'd ask the actual people that they are doing the BEST OF DVD'S for what they might want on there.  Perhaps let SNL fans vote on their favorite skits.

Of course, this is subjective to a point, but many SNL fans have been upset with regard to the Best of DVD's.  I'm hoping they won't screw up Tim Meadows or Chevy Chase when they eventually put those out, but not holding my breath.

One last thing.  Spade was on SNL for six years (okay five really).  Do you really have to put three or more skits from his hosting duties FROM LAST YEAR on this compilation.  Maybe one or two, but if you can't dig up an hour and fifteen minutes' worth of good comedy from that amount of time, you aren't really trying.  Also, can you at least make these Best Of's come off with a two hour runtime or more for God's sake.  I mean years on a show should not equal an hour, especially if you are giving time to a Best Of DVD.

Get it if you really like the Spade sarcasm.  [...]",1139702400,35,4426,4.34601226993865
2456421,3,B000CCD0GW,"The ""Best of"" SNL releases are a mixed bag with a lot of bombs and stinkers, but a few good ones. This is a great mixture of new and old stuff, and it really is some of David's better moments. His snippy receptionist (later the basis for his character on ""Just Shoot Me"") is in a hilarious skit involving Rosanne, and the skit where he and Teri Hatcher swap places in an interview for ""Spade in America"" is classic. He definitely has the best chemistry with Chris Farley and they play off each other well. It's also hilarious to see David as Joe Dirt show up again for a skit.

As in any SNL collection, there are some horrible stinkers. The PBS Afterschool Special segment is dumb, his interview with Sean Penn is a waste of time, and a skit involving the Weekend Update doesn't work. But compared to the second volume of the Will Ferrell best of collection, this one's perfect. All in all, one of their better releases, but with the wealth of material to choose from in the years he was on the show, you'd think they'd have all been winners.",1138147200,9,1043,4.376288659793815
