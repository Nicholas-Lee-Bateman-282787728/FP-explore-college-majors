8190814,5,B000PE3YTU,"Charlene Prickett and her daughter, Xanna, have two 36 minutes workouts on this DVD. The studio is still very white. Charlene Prickett was the host for the exercise series, ""It Figures,"" from 1976 to 1997. She was nicknamed the Queen of the TV Gym. Charlene has an unforgettable personality. She was born and raised in Arkansas; lived in England and moved to Calgary, Canada with her husband in the 1970s.

Watching Charlene again on DVD is fabulous, she and her daughter, Xanna, make it so easy. So if you're a Charlene Prickett fan, you will love to collect the DVDs and VHS before there are no more.",1518652800,,602,4.626168224299065
8190815,5,B000PE3YTU,"This DVD contains two workouts, each approximately 35 minutes.  The first workout starts with some killer plank work and proceeds to glutes, calves, and upper back; it finishes up with balance work. The second workout strengthens your abs, back, thighs, glutes, and triceps.  This is a surprisingly good core-based toning workout, not your same old run-of-the-mill exercises.  Charlene give a lot of form pointers, and her daughter Xanna teaches parts of the workout.  There's definitely a bond between the two of them, as evidenced by the friendly banter they share.",1252540800,4,567,5.266666666666667
8190816,4,B000PE3YTU,"I thought I was purchasing an aerobics workout with Charlene and her daughter.  Despite this oversight, I like this workout, which is all core training.  Very low impact, working balance and muscles in the abdomen, legs and back.  It's a good one for a slower day when you don't want to bounce too much.",1188691200,6,303,4.574074074074074
