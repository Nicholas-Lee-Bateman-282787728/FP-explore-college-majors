8089117,3,B000BMXR20,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD. The Talking Heads were great. Queen rocks. The Go-Go's look so young. Rick James jams. Duran Duran sounded great. Heck, all the performances are great. The problem is that I was hoping for a disc full of songs. DVD's these days hold a lot of information and SNL as usual lacks taking up any of that space. At least they don't edit the songs like they do the acts on the best of DVD's. There was just so much more from that era they could have added. Maybe one day the true vault will open up.",1160956800,9,528,4.186274509803922
