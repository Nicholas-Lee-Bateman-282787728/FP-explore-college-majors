6499993,2,B00LQPKK3K,"This film was a huge disappointment for me.  The casting of the older Hannah did not ring true in my opinion.  Not only did she not look like the younger Hannah but she became very much like the mother of her early lover.  Betrayal repeated!  It was also disappointing not to know the eventual outcome of their meeting and  I felt sorry for the husband.  Again, another film with no subtitles for the hearing impaired.  Don't producers/directors realize that these people exist and might like to see their film also??? But in this case it was no loss.",1429142400,2,551,4.561224489795919
6499994,5,B00LQPKK3K,This movie is fantastic! It's a tremendous love story between a polish man and a German Jewish girl during world war 2. Some polish and German but a lot of English has subtitles for the polish and German. Worth it it's so good.,1424390400,,227,4.3023255813953485
6499995,4,B00LQPKK3K,"Very moving film. I have watched a lot of movies based on the Holocaust and this one was able to touch on the horror and give great suspense but also show love and compassion. The film brings you back and forth from the 40's to the 70's and was well done and kept you enthralled in what would happen next. I felt I was with them on their journey and it kept haunting me in my dreams after I turned the TV off.

I couldn't help but look up the ""real"" people and what happened. If anyone is interested, it was just as touching.

This is a wonderful story about war and love-- two parallel stories going on in 1943 Poland and 1976 New York City. And this is based pretty accurately on a true story, which made me appreciate it even more.",1413072000,8,379,4.205479452054795

A married, middle-aged woman in 1976 America discovers that the man she loved and who rescued her from a concentration camp in wartime Poland is still alive.  We are told both the contemporary story of how she deals with this new knowledge and even more the story of her love and escape in the 1940s.  The old story is particularly gripping and moving.",1412899200,11,422,4.526315789473684

6500002,5,B00LQPKK3K,"First: this movie is incredible! It's the kind of movie that stays with you and you keep dwelling on it. The fact that it is based on a true
story is almost mind blowing. Second: I don't want to make a review that gives things away. The movie gets released with a little blip
stating what it is about and a review shouldn't have a spoiler. Most importantly is that I can't say enough how good this movie is and
I was spellbound for almost 2 hours. I do wish the ending was different; it is just chopped off and I wasn't expecting that, but really
that is a so-what. Very, very good movie that is worth every penny to rent or buy. At the end, look up the real people of the story, but
at the very end. I fell in love with the story and the actors and rooted for them the whole time... Watch and you'll see what I mean.",1514678400,3,817,4.0184049079754605

6500005,4,B00LQPKK3K,"This was a fascinating movie. I was able to get into this movie immediately. The action was there and although it was centered around a love story it didn't seem like the typical love story. The love story was apart of the movie but it did not seem like it was the whole movie. The producer was able to capture the audience's attention and keep it until the end of the movie.
The plot was simple and the movie was not complex or hard to follow. I actually enjoyed the movie because it was just a good movie and a breathe of relief from all the movies that have killing in it. You knew there were Nazi soldiers in the movie but I like the fact that the producer was able to take something that was so awful and pull out a beautiful love story, while never losing focus on the plot of the story. I will say the ending was unclear. I hate it that the producer left us in suspense at the end but it was not a bad suspense. I don't have one bad thing to say about the movie. It was so put together and left you feeling good by the time you finished the movie. You know there were prisoners trying to escape from the camps they were being held in and you knew bad things were happening in those camps. I do not want to act like terrible things did not happen in those camps. But what the producer did was focused on hope and freedom. The producer told the story in the form of hope throughout the movie. I think that was the central theme expressed throughout the movie which was never give up and never loose hope. I'm not sure how the movie really ended although I watched the movie to the complete end. I think the producer wanted the audience to decide on their own what they think should have happened at the end. I did not give the movie five stars but it was a really good movie. It was one of those movies that just kept your attention without you having to try to focus and understand what was going on. You will enjoy this movie.",1487548800,,1933,4.129973474801061

6500033,5,B00LQPKK3K,"A riveting contrast in time and place. Not solely the story of life in a Nazi death camp, nor life years later, this piece skillfully blends and juxtaposes the two. Tomasz, a captured Polish resistance fighter, and Hannah, a German Jew, are sustained in the camp by the bread he distributes and their loving and secret sexual connection. Their love, he describes, began in silence and first with the eyes and then with the bread he provided and they shared. He is able to formulate a clever escape for the pair and a lot of dramatic action and suspense are part of that fleeing. The scenes of their lovemaking, as they begin to move through the forest, are really quite beautiful in their gentle grittiness, their love clearly superseding any concerns about their cleanliness or likely smell or their malnourished bodies. So right in that depiction. Events cause them to become lost to each other and each assumes the other dead.  The very interesting element of meeting up with Hannah in the 1970's  in New York City in her attractive apartment with her husband and grown daughter, and alternating that time frame and physical comfort with the horrendous deprivation and bleakness of the wartime setting, creates powerful contrast and is fluidly executed. So is Tomasz dead? The rest remains to be seen. Skillfully and authentically acted, smartly directed, and filmed. A beautiful film. A definite recommend.",1475452800,2,1410,4.970338983050848

6500042,5,B00LQPKK3K,I absolutely loved this movie. It evoked in me a real sense of emotion throughout the film. It is amazing amidst such great suffering and death that the characters fell in love. I was disappointed in the end. Was unrequited love reignited?,1475193600,,239,4.714285714285714
6500043,5,B00LQPKK3K,"Well done movie about a couple interned during WWII who escaped and got separated afterwards.  Each thought the other was dead and they had to move on with their lives.  The movie is very authentic to the point where the scenes were visually and emotionally palpable.  Great photography and great scenery.  Most of the film is flashbacks as remembered by the woman.  She has a life and a family in NYC.  He has a life in Poland.  She spent years searching through the Red Cross to see if he was still alive.  He thought she was dead because his mother who had no compassion for Jews told him so.  The woman's search for her first love put a terrible strain on her husband, but she could not let go of the past.  She finally located him through the Red Cross.  Her husband tells her to go see him so she can put the past to rest.  The movie ends with her going to Poland to see her long lost love.  This needs a sequel because it leaves the audience wanting scenes of them remembering together and being sorrowful about what they could have had and what they endured in the camp and after their escape, yet grateful for what they do have.  This is a masterpiece of film making in all areas.",1475193600,,1189,4.297297297297297

Difficult movie to watch but it shows what happens when people lose their humanity and think of other religions, nationalities, color... people different from them as less and treat them as such.  We think this was something that happened only in Germany in the 1940's.  It is something that is happening today as well against gays, Black people, Hispanics, women, religions (Muslim esp. now), disabled, etc.  I hope it helps us to see all people are more alike than they are different.

If you enjoy watching grass grow, water boil, silent movies then you are in for one fine treat here! I wanted to hurl something at the screen every single time a question was asked and yet another long hard stare was skillfully employed to really get the drama going. The Camp scenes were brutal and I wish someone would stop making me hate hate hate every German soldier ever! Was there an additional 3 million non-Jews persecuted and wasn't Poland primarily Catholic?

I found the English translation to be poor in many instances, probably the worst to date but some reviews claimed there were none at all, so guess I need not complain.

Did Hannah ever have that baby? Did she end up staying with Tomasz forever when they reunited? Could this film move ANY slower with stilted, limited, meaningless dialogue? This is not my first time at the Rodeo with WWII atrocities but this was disrespectful. The screenplay adeptly drew the audience in with the illicit Camp affair but lost any capacity to evoke any emotion other than frustration beyond the escape.

I have great patience for Foreign, Silent, Abstract, Progressive films and gave it my all with this mess. I could not wait for the end to see what happens and had to endure all the travel scenes, smoke billowing, blank facial expressions etc.

Arghhhhhh, do not recommend anything here. It is based on a true story and you wonder how can one pull off an affair under such strict supervision. That was the only moment when you might have an inkling of appreciation for survival mode.

If you are from Poland this depicts horrific acts by both enemy and ally. I did learn a few words and it seems difficult to learn Polish.",1473552000,3,1722,4.666666666666667

6500099,5,B00LQPKK3K,"I just saw this movie on Netflix and I just knew it had to have been based on a true story, see:

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/world/europe/jerzy-bielecki-dies-at-90-fell-in-love-in-a-nazi-camp.html

The movie very realistically portrays the raw terror of life and death in Auschwitz and how this couple successfully escapes the death camp.  This is truly a triumph of good over evil, yet at a very, very high price.  The movie was suspenseful and kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the movie.

To make the movie even better, I would have changed the screen play as follows:

1)  Since in real life Hannah's American husband died before Hannah found Tomascz, it would have been far less painful to have excluded the whole screen play of the husband and daughter lack of empathy for Hannah's keeping her Auschwitz history a secret.  A far more educational screen play could have been added where Hannah would share her Holocaust experiences with fellow survivors and their non-Holocaust family members.  Americans have a difficult time understanding the depths of man's depravity toward fellow man (witness Americans lack of empathy for water boarded prisoners);

2)  It would be wonderful if the movie gave more substance to ""AK"" the Polish Underground Army.  I didn't understand why the Red Army whisked away Tomascz's brother and sister-in-law until I realized that they were part of the AK.  Obviously some Communist sympathizer neighbor ratted them out to the Red Army and they were toast;

3)  The subtitles should have identified which language was being spoken when.  This movie contains English, German, Polish and Russian and for someone who doesn't speak all four languages it is difficult to figure out who is speaking what language.

4)  I realize that Hannah and Tomascz survived their ordeal escaping Auschwitz, however, it would have been a bit more spicy to know more of the near misses they experienced before they were completely free.  There must have been more scenes like where Hannah almost freezes to death in the harsh Polish winter.  Life is experienced in a series of moments and the heaven's stars aligned perfectly for these two people to have survived this horrible ordeal.",1448582400,2,2214,5.148459383753502

6500102,4,B00LQPKK3K,"""Remembrance"" depicts a remarkable love story that blossomed amidst the terror of a German concentration camp in 1944 Poland. Screenwriter Pamela Katz used the true life story of the late Jerzy Bielecki, a Polish man who fled Auschwitz with his Polish Jewish lover, Cyla Cybulska, as the basis of the script for German director Anna Justices 2011 film. The film is in English. This is such an emotionally powerful and poignant tale and has stayed with me for a long time after I saw it.

In a WWII concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, the film follows young Polish prisoner Tomasz Limanowski, (the real life Jerzy), played by Mateusz Damieck, and his Jewish girlfriend Hannah Silberstein, (in actuality Cyla Cybulska), with Alice Dwyerin in this role.

There are two interwoven stories here framed in flashbacks. The film opens in 1976 and fifty-two year-old Hannah, (now played by Dagmar Manzel), is married and living in New York. She is suddenly overwhelmed by memories of Auschwitz and what came after it. This flow of feeling is prompted by an interview she sees on television. The man on the screen is recalling his flight from Auschwitz and as she listens she is seized with the conviction that he is Tomasz, whom she has long believed to be dead. She desperately calls the Red Cross that day, for the first time since 1946, when her initial search for Tomasz had led to a dead end. Now Hannah is conflicted by her feelings. She has a well established life and family but she also has a deep need to see Tomasz again.

The storyline then cuts back in time to 1944, where much of the action takes place. Tomasz Limanowski, a captured member of the Polish resistance, manages to aid the ""cause"" from inside a concentration camp, where his slave labor includes supervising distribution of loaves of bread. As a non-Jewish political prisoner, he lives in slightly better conditions than his fellow inmates. His resistance task in the camp has been to capture photos of the horrifying war crimes taking place and smuggle out the negatives that will reveal these crimes to the outside world. Hannah Silberstein is a young German Jewess imprisoned in the work camp. She and Tomasz fall desperately in love and it is their love which sustains them, somewhat, amongst the horrors of reality. Whenever possible, Tomasz buys off his fellow office worker with a bottle of vodka so that he and Hannah can be alone together. They share bread that Tomasz has stolen for them and they share love, almost as precious as food in the camp. With the assistance of other inmates, Tomasz gains access to an SS uniform and forged papers. On the day of the escape, terrified that it is happening too quickly to be fully prepared, Tomasz dresses up as an SS officer and demands that Hannah follow him, all the while horrified that he will be exposed as a Polish prisoner. Tomasz walks her to the exit of the camp. The guard, not picking up on Tomasz's limited German, allows the couple to pass, and Tomasz and Hannah successfully march down the road until out of sight and run off into the woods. This escape strains the imagination...but it actually happened. Director Anna Justice captures the urgency of these scenes, imbuing them with tension. We feel the miraculous sense of relief in their flight - although their odyssey is far from over once they're outside the camp, living as fugitives.

The wartime sequences are so involving that I found it wrenching when the plot returns -  as it regularly does - to the older Hannah in New York. There's a staginess to these sequences and I found Hannah's husband's role, played by David Rasche, to be jarring and not in accord with the rest of the film. His voice and dialogue irritate me. The present day aspect of the movie doesnt hold up in my opinion. Not only does this later storyline offer little of interest in terms of action, the scenes play out awkwardly, despite a steady performance from Manzel.

""Remembrance"" is compelling viewing. Given the time span, it's important to establish the emotional bond, the human importance of what's at stake in the romantic relationship and how it was forged in the fires of desperation and danger. That's where the emotional depth comes from for both the characters and the viewers. The film's creators rightly call it a story about the effects of chance and the notion of the path not taken and the life not lived.

6500104,4,B00LQPKK3K,"By all means watch this film if you enjoy great acting and a tender moving story beautifully told. But the one flaw that spoiled it for me was the casting of the two actresses who played Hannah at different ages. Trying to convince yourself that the actress who played the role in present day was the same person you were seeing in the flashbacks was absolutly impossible. Nothing wrong with either performance but the two couldn't have looked less alike. The younger Hannah had large soulful eyes and a rather fine sculptured nose while the older had small deep-set eyes and a very prominant nose. Granted years and conditions can make a difference in ones looks but this was nothing but distracting. You may be able to overlook it, and if you can you have a real treat coming.",1437091200,4,778,4.60431654676259

I read a little bit about escapes from this camp and there were two couples who made an escape like described in the movie: one was successful (which is the plot of this movie) and another one unsuccessful. The first couple was Polish man and Jewish woman who left the camp as a dressed guard and a prisoner. They were captured 10 days later and after undergoing torture both were executed. The second couple was also Polish-Jewish couple (man dressed as a guard and a woman). The man joined the partisan unit and a woman went into hiding by Poles until liberation.
