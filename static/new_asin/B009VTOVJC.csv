8725705,5,B009VTOVJC,"The boxset is phenomenal, incredible features, beautifully housed. If you don't have the first 3 Hellraiser movies, consider this as an option. You must have a region specific or region free Blu-ray player to watch these.",1528416000,,221,5.166666666666667
8725706,5,B009VTOVJC,"I got this right when it was released.  Just so everyone understands how to tell right away if this a blu ray is from another region.  See the 18 on the box? Anytime you see that,  it will only play in region free or all region blu ray players.  I have about 200 imports so I'm  familiar  with how to tell which are American (A) vs. Imports (B, and C).  Hope this helps anyone who is uncertain.  I would suggest when it's affordable to get a region free player, or all region player,  you then don't have to deal with this issue, plus you can play any blu ray from any country,  which pretty much all have English audio options.  They cost around 150 for a good name brand one.",1499731200,,677,4.130769230769231
