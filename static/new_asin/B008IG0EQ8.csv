5167185,5,B008IG0EQ8,This movie was good but the ending was twisted!  I was surprised that there was no nudity in it like other teen horror flicks.,1372204800,,126,4.25

5167187,1,B008IG0EQ8,"this is a low cheap budget movie, made in UK, is a terrible home made VHS movie, bad producers, bad directors, no naked, nothing, a bunch of white Briton retards talk all the time...do not buy do not rent do not make copy, is in Netflix...bad",1369699200,2,242,4.282608695652174
5167188,4,B008IG0EQ8,Great movie. Kept me interested throughout. Good cast and you gotta love the British accent (makes the funny parts even funnier). The movie is campy at times and has its flaws but overall a great revenge thriller with its fair share of twists. Catch!,1368662400,,250,4.704545454545454
5167189,4,B008IG0EQ8,Not a bad movie coming from Britain. Good enough to keep your interest as to who sent the postcard (lol). I really enjoyed the end as the hot big boobied chick turns things around. A good flick that keeps your interest.,1368403200,4,219,4.365853658536586
5167190,5,B008IG0EQ8,"Just watched this film last night and i have to say its pretty damn good, actually i take that back its very good, probably the best teen party film gone bad film in awhile. The plot is very basic its your revenge film seen in everything from Terror Train to Happy Birthday to Me, but this has a freshness and very good acting that sets it apart. Most impressively is the way the victims become almost animalistic they turn on each other and things get ; well a bit messy. I cant say enough good things about this i am getting it for 1.60 on Amazon used for my collection and it ill fit in nicely . So i say for a dollar 60 its so worth checking this film out, Not since the original Scream have i seen a film that has taken very over used territory and sprinkled it with a good director and great acting to make it seem fresh.",1368316800,5,827,4.079754601226994
5167191,3,B008IG0EQ8,"I've never fully understood the attraction of the ""Truth or Dare"" game since choosing either optio is intended to place its participants in embarrasing situations.
TRUTH OR DIE uses this game as a catapult for a story of revenge enacted upon a group of young college students.  This retribution comes at the hands of the brother of a shy, diffident student who suffered humiliation from the students at a Christmas party and commits suicide. Under the pretense of a party, brother Justin invites the abusive students to exact his revenge.
There are parts of the film that were involving and intriguing but the film's conclusion is a little muddled and confusing.
David Oakes (THE BORGIAS) leads a cast of young newcomers who fare well on the most part.  The movie has some sluggish parts that hamper the suspense, but this is not your typical slasher flick.
Overall, a moderately entertaining diversion worth a rental.",1351814400,3,918,4.954545454545454
5167192,5,B008IG0EQ8,"There is a costume party going on with a bunch of cool kids. Felix (Tom Kane) has a crush on Gemma (Florence Hall) and wants to ask her out. He is a shy dweeb and doesn't have a costume ...unless dweeb is a costume. Luke (Alexander Vlahos) is the party specialist who fixes Felix up with a white line of instant courage. Gemma turns him down as she is dating Chris (Jack Gordon). An altercation happens while playing ""Truth or Dare"" where Chris slugs Felix.

Later, the gang which includes the over sexed Eleanor (Jennie Jacques) and her boyfriend Paul (Liam Boyle), one of those rare guys who can fall asleep right after doing a line of coke, head out to the country to celebrate Felix's birthday. They are greeted by Justin (David Oakes), Felix's brother and ex-soldier, who has his own ideas on how to play ""Truth or Dare.""

I enjoyed what the Brits did to this common theme, geek kid humiliated/revenge slasher film. Good sound track. Good action. Jennie Jacques reminded me of Fairuza Balk during her slutty roles. Good abduction/torture style movie.

Parental guide: F-bomb, sex, girls kissing, drugs/alcohol use",1350777600,11,1118,4.782383419689119
5167193,4,B008IG0EQ8,"""Truth or Die"" or ""Truth or Dare"" as it was first called is a well put together UK revenge film with a twist. A group of friends are invited to Felix' birthday party at his family home in the country. Felix a so called friend to the group had been tormented previously at a party with a game of truth or dare. Once the group arrives they find out from Felix' brother that he is stuck out of town. The brother invites the group in to where introductions are made, this is where the film really starts to take off as true intentions are revealed to why the group is actually there and a deadly new game of truth or dare takes the group by surprise.

This is not a slasher or gory film but a suspenseful thriller with a twist that will have you waiting for what might happen next. There's nothing new going on in ""Truth or Die"" aside the fact that its a revenge film about a game of truth or dare but what is does do suspense and thrill wise is worth the watch. Not to mention the twist which is pretty messed up if I do say so!

There's not much bad I can say about ""Truth or Die"" as I found everything to be on point production and cast wise which played their roles perfectly I might ad. I guess if I had one gripe it would be that they could of threw in a little gore and had more creative torture scenes, other than that I have to say Bloody-Disgusting Selects picked up a nice film to add to their hit or miss collection of horror/thriller films as this is definitely one of their better selections.",1350691200,3,1502,4.122866894197952
5167194,5,B008IG0EQ8,"David Oaks of 'The Borgias"" leads a cast of well rounded actors in this neither slasher nor Torture Porn film as the trailer would have you believe.
It is instead a great at times genius Physiological Thriller.
It starts off at a Christmas party where some college students are partying and playing a risque game of Truth or Dare.

You have all the usual characters varying from the sweet girl to the jerk.
Enter Felix an introverted,shy boy with no self esteem,something that he finds traumatizing happens and then it cuts to months later and all the kids that were involved in the shaming of Felix are invited to his elaborate estate for his Birthday Party,problem is the party isn't in the huge castle like estate but way back in the woods behind it in a shack plus Felix isn't there to welcome them but instead his very willing brother ""Oaks' who is of Military mindset who holds them captive to play 'his' version of Truth or Dare.

The surprises keep coming and coming as the rest of the story unfolds.
It's an amazing plot that might seem cliche' at first but just wait.
It's a story about revenge and then some. There is a shortage of effects and gore but I still give it 5 stars because of the acting ,story and revelations along the journey.",1349740800,5,1251,4.506607929515418
5167195,1,B008IG0EQ8,Why is homophobia so prevalent in today's films?  It's always in films that are directed at teenagers...,1434585600,,104,5.117647058823529

5167199,4,B008IG0EQ8,"I hadn't heard of this before but the cover presents it as a mindless slasher film. It's actually quite a bit more complex than that and the performers are very competent. The basic plot is five schoolmates attend a huge party where some unpleasantness occurs. Months later four of the five are reunited by an invitation from the fifth to his birthday party. When they arrive they're met by the friend's brother and informed they're the only guests due to a mis-communication. They start the party and soon things begin to go badly badly wrong.

It's surprisingly strong and more psychological thriller than anything else. There is one fairly gory scene but it's over pretty quickly and the aftermath only appears onscreen briefly at a later point. The blood and gore factor is nowhere near adequate for an actual slasher film. Stand out performances by Alexander Vlahos as Luke and David Oakes as Justin.",1419724800,3,905,4.876623376623376

5167202,3,B008IG0EQ8,"I enjoyed this film for intensity and character development but the storyline was much too jagged.  And the ending was a real downer.  I wasn't expecting, nor did I need to know the ""truth"".  A better ending would have been to have the suicide hanging attempt at the end of the movie...and the brother to kill himself for being such a jerk.  All-in-all it was a good thriller.  I did doze off in the middle...but not because it was a boring flick...I was just dead tired when I started to watch it.  I had to go back and catch up once I awoke.  Three stars.  Worth a watch.",1393286400,,573,4.2407407407407405
5167203,5,B008IG0EQ8,"The acting is a little cheesy but it's a good story. You're totally caught off guard a few times throughout the movie. It's gory but not overly so as to make it ridiculous, with a fair amount of suspense, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror movies.",1390780800,2,255,4.333333333333333
5167204,3,B008IG0EQ8,"I haven't seen too many of these kinds of movies and I'm beginning to suspect why. After seeing this one I've decided they just don't have much to offer.

Here's the scoop. A meek young man, (Felix) from a wealthy family, is embarrassed (and punched in the nose) at a party while playing a game of truth or dare. Some while later the principals in the incident are invited to a party by Felix. For some reason they decide to go. When they arrive they find Felix isn't there but they are greeted by his older brother who is just back from 3 tours in the mid-east. He's really upset about what happened to his brother and he wants them all to play another game of truth or dare. But they'll be playing it his way.

This is some ugly, nasty stuff. Most of the party are a worthless bunch, save for Gemma who was the object of Felix's affection and the reason he got punched in the nose. The game goes on and one by one the participants are psychologically and physically tortured and killed. There are escape attempts and near successes, a lot of pleading, reasoning and soul searching to try and avoid the inevitable. The story is decent enough to move things along. I found myself hanging in there just to see how inevitable the outcome would be. Thankfully there was a twist. It helped me give this another star. The acting, directing, music, etc. were all good enough to move things along. I'm guessing that torture flicks, like slasher flicks, just have too narrow a format to make anything of. So they become more an exercise in craft than art. But...maybe I'm asking too much. Those who go to see this kind of movie will probably get just what they wanted right here.",1376352000,,1671,4.4397394136807815

8528478,4,B008IG0EQ8,"A group of students have a party and play truth or dare, humiliating a rich geeky kid who no one normally takes much notice of. A few months later the ringleaders are invited to a birthday party for the same guy and decide to go along as he belongs to a wealthy family and they see an opportunity for some cheap drinks. Once they arrive the party starts out well enough but soon takes a turn for the worse.

This is an excellent British revenge horror film. It's a little slow to start but from the thirty minute mark things take off and the pace is strong until the end. There is quite a bit of time spent introducing the characters and exploring their personalities which helps to build a rapport with the audience. You also get to see the various strengths and weaknesses of each person which sits below the surface, as the danger of their situation becomes clear.

The acting here is great and the story is well thought out. The amount of care is obvious, particularly when we reach the climax and the film takes a further turn - lesser quality productions would have taken the easy way out but the ending is well worth staying around for.

The film is a good length at just over 90 minutes and well worth a watch.",1484870400,5,1218,4.356828193832599

8528482,2,B008IG0EQ8,"It was a simple graduation party in the suburbs of London, that was starting to get boring. With nothing else to do, the drunk teenagers decide to play Truth or Dare. One of the popular kids decides to use the opportunity to embarrass one of the less popular kids with disastrous results. In order to make it up to him, the popular kids agree to go to his birthday party, at a lavish country house, but when they get there, Felix isn't there. Instead the group finds his older brother, who forces them to play a more extreme game. I love the horror site Bloody Disgusting, and I watch most of what they recommend. For some reason they occasionally choose these obscure British films, with actors I've never heard of, and they almost always turn out like this. Truth or Die is unbelievably slow moving, and as expected, nothing really happens until the last ten minutes, and even that didn't make this film worth watching. As for the cast, it's no wonder I never heard of them, because most of them were absolutely terrible. The story is somewhat unbelievable to begin with, but add to that a bad cast, with thick accents, bumbling lines, and you get a film that is nearly unwatchable. I respect the opinions of our friends at Bloody Disgusting, but in this case, I don't know how they could have made this a selected film, it really is a complete waste of time.",1445126400,,1361,4.51417004048583
