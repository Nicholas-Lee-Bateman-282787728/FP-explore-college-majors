7937595,4,B00005BIG1,This video is appropriate for 10 years and up. It's a bit more scientific and technical than the IMAX Dolphin movie. It would be perfect for use as part of a classroom unit.,1334016000,,173,4.2727272727272725
7937596,4,B00005BIG1,"Given the fact that my opinion towards any dolphin media is biased I will start out with my observations on the DVD itself.  The format was a little disappointing in the fact that the sound was only stereo.  There were no special features on the disc, and no options, besides play, and scene selection.  On to the content.  The reason why I stand by the 4 star rating is this:  This film is one of the most informative program on dolphins I have seen to date.  As I mentioned before, I have a bias towards dolphins, so I enjoyed the DVD because of it's crisp picture, and content.  I found the feature amusing at times as well, especially the Orca/sea lion football.  In short, this DVD is a documentary in every sense.  I love dolphins, so I loved the DVD, if the DVD had been in Dolby surround, then perhaps I would have given it a 5 star rating.  If you love dolphins, and don't care about special features, or sound effects, then it's a good purchase.",995414400,29,955,4.344632768361582
