7882328,5,6304985975,"Dead By Dawn is a neat little thriller. Shannon Tweed, the queen of B-movies, has probably never given a better performance than she does in this story of a basically good man duped into an insurance scheme and murder by his old high school buddy. This film has surprisingly excellent acting, including strong performances by Jodie Fisher and Cassandra Gava. There is loads of atmosphere and suspense and unlike most straight to video Shannon Tweed movies, Dead By Dawn is really a complex, tightly written thriller.",1524268800,,516,5.011627906976744

7882330,1,6304985975,"Would take six seconds to solve the case in the real world.

The ending is SO STUPID it's hysterical :)",1518393600,,103,4.15
7882331,4,6304985975,"This is a great movie for someone looking for some good campy (possibly intoxicated) entertainment. There are great themes regarding dominance and dare I say, ""The Will To Power"", all woven around some good barely soft-core smut. The questions raised on masculinity and success are still timely in 2018.",1518048000,,303,5.204081632653061
7882332,3,6304985975,"Really, not bad. The story was pretty good. Wendy's husband (Tim?) played his role well.",1517011200,,88,4.933333333333334

7882334,5,6304985975,"This film is a rare collector's item, and a must-have for Shannon Tweed fans.  Also features Cassandra Gava as one of the first Asian-American female cops in movie history, and a cameo appearance by character actor John Timmons.  Well-written, well-paced, entertaining story, with Bill Ferrell portraying a believable, sympathetic, ""ordinary guy"", an anti-hero with whom most of us can actually identify.  Jodie Fisher's character development will surprise some women viewers.  While everyone knows Shannon Tweed was a playboy centerfold, did you know actor Ted Prior modeled for (I believe it was) Playgirl?  This film is underway to becoming an underground cult classic -- and not because of the controversy it stirred among TV Channel 4 viewers in the U.K.!",1189296000,5,760,5.352941176470588
7882335,4,6304985975,"Dead by Dawn is a true sleeper.  The acting is very good,  there is a lot of suspense, and the production values are excellent.  This is Shannon Tweed's best movie.",1139356800,2,164,4.4
