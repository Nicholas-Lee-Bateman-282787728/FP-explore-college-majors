8184310,1,B000OCY60O,"Well, I really did not hate Jack of Diamonds. I hate Amazon for posting a complete set of reviews for the anime series ""Diamond Daydreams"" as reviews for the action film ""Jack of Diamonds"". C'mon, Amazon tech wizards, let's get the show on the road and get reviews posted to the correct series.",1507680000,,294,4.566037735849057
8184311,5,B000OCY60O,"Yes, I'm a romantic (but not overly so). This is a nice change of pace from mecha, action, shoujo and the like. It's slice of life about different young ladies and their romantic interests, and how it plays out differently for each of them. Some good, some not. They're all separate stories, but put together into one series.
Not everyone will care for this anime, certainly not kids. I'd say it's oriented more to older teens and adults. I'd rate it heavy PG at most, R would be overdoing it.",1403740800,,493,4.488888888888889
8184312,5,B000OCY60O,"WOW! That's what I thought when I saw this series. I have seen a great many anime series, lots of them end up falling through the cracks and collect dust on my shelf. This one is a unrecognized gem that I don't see myself having to dust off very frequently. I have been collecting anime for 15 years and I just stumbled onto this one by accident. It's great. It is the story of 6 women living in Hokkaido. They all leaad very different lives, but they share a common bond. Even though these girls have never met they are tied together by their aching hearts. Each girl is given 2 episodes to encounter a problem and find a solution. I think that a few of them are better than the others.

ATSUKO is a 20 year old girl who works at her family's fish market with her Mom. Her Father passed away and left them in debt. They may have to sell the market to pay off the debt. Atsuko was promised to a young man with tons of money. He really loves Atsuko adn tries to do what he can to win her affection and save her market, but Atsuko resents being forced into a marriage that she doesn't choose. She meets a man that is in his 30's and plays sax at a jazz club. She finds his way of life refreshing and liberating. She is torn between doing what is going to make her family happy and following her heart.

KARIN has a medical condition that requires surgery. She is scared and doesn't want to go through with it. Her Father died on the operating table when she was a small girl. She lays around in the hospital putting off the inevitable. She gets encouragement from her loving brother, her doctor, and a secret admirer on the internet. She falls in love with her doctor and begins to discover that she isn't alone. The people around her may give her the strength to go on living.

KYOKO is an up and coming film maker. She won an award in an amateur film festival. Ever since then she drives her friends crazy and takes their help making her movie for granted. Her selfishness and obsession drives away the one she loves the most and causes her to lose her vision. With nothing left she must face herself and rediscover the reasons she loves film making.

SUOMI was born to be on the ice. She and her friend Hanna pledged to do their best and win medals together. That's in the past though. An accident has ended their friendship and Suomi's desire to skate. Life goes on leaving her dreams behind. A chance to skate again pops up and she must decide what to do. Will she seize the day, or will she let the chance pass her by.

SHOKO is a radio host. She has a show where she gives relationship advice to the bewildered. She has relationship troubles of her own though. Living alone with a fly by night lover isn't an ideal situation. She soon discovers that she has a stalker. She is happy for the attention, but a little freaked out by it. After she crumbles and realizes that an unhappy woman has no business giving advice to so many people, she gives up and falls apart on the air. At her darkest moment her stalker bursts in and gives her the encouragement and appreciation that she needs to realize how truly important she is.

AKARI has lived alone with her Dad ever since her mother died. She works and tries to keep the two together, but her Father is a mess. He's always drinking and panning for gold. Her situation is tough, but she soon finds out that Dad has brain cancer. She doesn't have much time left to spend with him, but she has a supportive friend. She may be able to have one last special moment with Dad before he dies.

This anime is mostly great, there are a few stories that don't quite hit home for me. Kyoko, the film student, is kind of an insufferable bitch and it's hard to like her. She becomes a nicer girl in the end of her story though. The story of Suomi was a little weaker than the others, but also had a strong ending. Overall this series is awesome, and one of those hidden gems that you feel blessed to find. The soundtrack, and animation are excellent. There are also some very familiar voices. Luci Christian, Vic Mignogna, Chris Patton, Jessica Boone, Kira Vincent-Davis, and Brittney Karbowski all play some great characters. This is a sentimental and touching series that brings a happy tear to your eye.",1352937600,3,4246,4.333333333333333
8184313,5,B000OCY60O,"Loved the stories of the 6 ladies and how it all came together.  This Anime draws the same audience as Air with love, drama and comedy.",1332201600,,135,4.1923076923076925
8184314,5,B000OCY60O,The price I paid for this DVD set was well worth it. The stories in this series was wonderful and it kept you entertained.  If your not looking for all the fanservice then this is for you.,1332028800,,188,4.081081081081081
8184315,4,B000OCY60O,"This is the type of story that is just like a short story. There are actually 6 stories to the series, 2 per disk. The first 2 were the best in my opinion. After that some were decent and some were a bit on the boring side. If you just watch 1 or 2 episodes at a time then it will be a better experience. There is not a lot of drama or action in the show. Dont expect a lot of fighting or things blowing up because it is not there in this show. It is just a good, straight forward story with just a few little twists, but overall, more of a short story type of writing.

They have kind of a bonus episode at the end that incorporates where all the girls from all 6 stories kinda meet in the town and get to talk to each other on one way or another.

Overall, if you like short stories, then give it a try, but do not go for it if you only like nude scenes, action, adventure, a lot of drama, etc. in a story because it is not there in this one.",1272067200,3,944,3.786802030456853
8184316,2,B000OCY60O,"I probably would have enjoyed this better if I hadn't tried to watch the stories back to back. Spread over a few weeks, they would probably be much more entertaining. A few of the stories moved so slowly, it became difficult to sit through them. I can say with confidence that if I paid $48, I would have been dreadfully disappointed with this series. Since I bought it used, it was a little less painful. The stories do encourage self reflection, which should count for something. (two stars, to be exact) People probably could identify with at least one lead character. I was hoping for a good chick flick type anime, but this one was severely lacking something. I guess that would be the entertainment factor.",1219622400,4,712,4.658730158730159
8184317,4,B000OCY60O,"Diamond Daydreams goes into great detail on the problems and choices that a lot of people would go through in life. A surgery that could save your life, In love with someone in a relationship, Being forced to marry someone who is rich because your has financial problems, and a parent who who spending every last speck of money you're making, but still love them to death. Diamond Daydreams is a great collection of short stories that everyone can understand no matter who you are.",1215820800,3,481,4.670588235294118
8184318,5,B000OCY60O,"Diamond daydreams actually consists of 6 different stories about the lives and the difficulties that six women have to go through.  Even from the first dvd there is a profound meaning passed through.  In the end, without even realizing it, all stories melt into one in a lovely, heartwarming way, that makes you really realize the true meanings of love, strong will, solidarity and commitment.  When you finish the series your heart is filled with all these emotions and even questions about your own life...
Diamond daydreams is definetely a series worth watching!  Don't miss it!",1204934400,11,581,5.020833333333333
