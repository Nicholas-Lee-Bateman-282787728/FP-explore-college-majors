8363378,4,6303305539,"CEO of Dawson Enterprises Leonard Dawson, hires a legion of mercenaries, cut-throats, and military personnel to eradicate the hitman responsible for his son's assasination.  The targeted hitman is none other than the legendary sharpshooter Golgo 13, who travels under the alias of Duke Togo and carries the reputation of the man who never misses.  Although feared by some and despised by many, the women who are privilaged to know intimately of him, understand him to be quite a charmer and gentlemen (a useful characteristic to potentially extract any, if not all of the useful information they may infact possess.)  The name Golgo 13 itself harbors a biblical connotation.  Golgotha for instance, is the hill upon which the philosopher and carpenter Jesus Christ was crucified.  The 13 on the other hand, despite it's popular myth of being a number symbolizing bad luck, is representated as the number of the man who was responsible, for having placed a crown of thorns upon the head of the individual whom millions perceive to have been the corporeal manifestation of God... ... ... But enough info relating to the plot of the film, or of it's starring character, instead let us move on to various reasons as to why I decided to give this film a rating of what It got.  These various reasons include:
1.) Plot: The plot of the film in my opinion rivals almost any delivered in other prominent live-action movies.  If for those of whom who have seen this film do not agree with me, I simply ask them to view the last ten minutes of it and tell me where else they have seen such splendid utilization of irony and in some elements, tragedy.
2.)Character Development: Aside from Golgo 13 and a few other of his aiding and abetting compatriots (i.e. Clockmaker) the other characters presented were quite intriguing and above-par of other supporting characters of other films.  Charactes like Leonard Dawson, his Daughter-in-law, the various ""bad guys"" he dispatches to elimate Golgo 13 (i.e. Gold & Silver and Snake) were all very engrossing to watch.  On the other hand, I was somewhat disappointed at the seeming lack of three dimensional development on Golgo 13's part in the film.  Yes, I understand that he is supposed to be an amoral assasin who only works for the highest bidder, yes, I also seemed to have understood how Golgo 13's ""amoralness"" may have been used as a sort of literary device to ""draw out"" the various emotions and feelings expressed by Leonard Dawson and his daughter-in-law, and yes, I understand that Golgo 13 was originally intended to be a man with no convictions (or personality for that matter... that was a joke by the way, so you laugh at it if you want to, or just give it the finger for having meandered from the point of this critical analysis like everyone else has, but don't think that'll hurt my feelings any... Sniff) what so ever by it's original creator (Takao Saito) and the film's director and writer (Osamu Dezaki & Hideyoshi Nagasaka.) No, instead why I complain of Golgo 13's lack of character development is that it is my understanding that in the comic book series, (of which I know little about) pieces of Golgo 13's unknown past have and continues to be revealed to the legions of Male-Japanese readers after a published life span of over 25 years.  However, these pieces of his past are in no way shape or form revealed to the movie viewer in any of his three films (the other two being Queen Bee and live-acted Assignment Kowloon.)  Instead Golgo 13 continues to be a character with an unknown name, nationality, and past.
3.)Direction: Let me start off by saying that as far as a film's direction, cinematography, editing techniques, coloring, etc. are concerned, I am by no means an expert on these fields, given that I have a tendency to single-mindedly focus on a film,book, or song's content (i.e. underlying story, theme, or message) rather than the context in how it is presented.  At any rate I'll give it a shot.  I felt the the direction and animation was breathtaking for it's time, and in some extent still is.  A particularly favorite scene of mine is when Golgo 13 fires a bullet from the window of a hotel, directed at the ex-S.S. war criminal turned business tycoon Don Hughes (formerly known as Albert Muehler during his S.S. days in Nazi Germany 'keep in mind this film was made in 1983' what is interesting about this scene, is that once Golgo 13 fires the bullet, we are treated to a first person bullet POV (Point Of View) shot as it propels itself from the barrel of Golgo 13's gun, shoots it's way (pardon the pun) through the air, penetrates itself through Don's condominium window, and slam dunks itself right between the Aryan bastard's eyes (Golgo 13's trademark killing by the way, a shot between the eyes.)  Aside from that particular scene, the Computer Enhanced sequences are cool (if somewhat dated by today's standards,) as is the fact that the entire film is animated (I absolutely love it when animation is given the sophiscated treatment it so rightly deserves.)
Overall, if you by now haven't switched to something else and are still reading this review... awake, I would highly recommend this film to anyone who pursues any obscure title of any media, which has received little, if any spotlight recognition, or for anyone who generally likes for their films to mix action packed entertainment, with a thought provoking script (I also notice that Terminators 1 & 2 fall under that catagory, as well as Matrix, the ORIGINAL Star Wars Trilogy, and The Professional starring a very young Natalie Portman 'not to be confused with the film that I am reviewing which harbors the same name.')
Hyuckkk! Good bye now!",1027468800,3,5699,4.788187372708758
