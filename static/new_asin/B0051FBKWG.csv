8452608,1,B0051FBKWG,"i bought this for a friend, kind of expensive; the site specifically stated this is a region 0 dvd. it arrived today from Germany and is a PAL disc, made by bfi.uk. the case is also cracked. i have a PAL player but I don't like to loan out stuff. any suggestions? the way i remember it everyone was pleased it was region free. since bfi is a ""charity"" company why would they make various versions... it's always something...",1454284800,,424,4.379746835443038
8452609,3,B0051FBKWG,There were a lot of these Brit independent movies produced in the 60s and 70s. Many of them are available from the BFI on DVD or Blu-ray. This is one of the better ones but you still come away from it feeling it could have been a whole lot better. However when you take into account the rushed and low budget circumstances under which it was made (described in the documentary) they did a pretty good job. Definitely not a masterpiece but worth a purchase and certainly a rental.,1444348800,,479,4.393258426966292
8452610,5,B0051FBKWG,"I saw this film during its original theater release in the 1970s. - very memorable.  Susan, played really well by Jane Asher is a local hottie that toys with a young male co-worker's mind - just because she can. Spectacular theater and imagery with Van Gogh colors throughout - as the canoe heads toward the waterfall. A disturbing moment at the end shows briefly that Susan understands who she has been - but sadly pays too much for what she has done.",1442707200,2,452,4.512195121951219
8452611,1,B0051FBKWG,DVD is a PAL format which wasn't explained in the product description. I haven't been able to watch it because I don't have a Blu-ray player yet. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known about the PAL format.,1440460800,4,208,4.225
8452612,4,B0051FBKWG,"Not to be confused with the much later and totally different Tilda Swinton movie, ""Deep End"" is a dark dramedy set in late-60s London about the obsession of ""Mike"", a 15-year-old bath house attendant (John Moulder Brown) with ""Susan"", his beautiful, sexy, flirtatious and promiscuous coworker (Jane Asher, who was famous at the time for being Paul McCartney's ex-fiancee).  For many years, this was a hard-to-find cult classic despite the director Jerzy Skolimowski's past work with Roman Polanski and despite its being one of Jane Asher's better films.  Now that it's available, it's definitely worth watching, especially if you like films about 60s London.  Just be aware that this is NOT going to be your standard coming-of-age drama where everybody has a few laughs, grows up a little and parts friends.  In fact, viewed from a modern perspective it's hard to determine whether Mike is a budding psycho or just a naive, confused young teen thrust into an exploitative adult world for which he is ill prepared.  It's hard to imagine a 15-year-old boy taking on an adult responsibility like a full-time job, and the more so when it involves constantly being around women in states of undress (including Susan in her micro-miniskirts) who may or may not want more from him than just a towel.  Jane Asher does a great job of humanizing her character, whom the viewer would probably otherwise dislike for being a tease, a cheater, a gold digger and by today's standards, perhaps even a child molester.  I suspect ""Deep End"" went on to influence the film ""Quadrophenia"" as there are definite similarities between the two films - the bath house and underwater scenes, the teen stuck in a low-level job with a pompous old boss, and of course the  obsession with getting the attention of a beautiful, flirty girl who seeks excitement by exercising her powers over men, even though she has a responsible and well-off fiance waiting in the wings.",1424304000,8,1939,4.92638036809816
8452613,5,B0051FBKWG,"Jerzy Skolimowski, friend of Roman Polanski, for whom he worked on Polanski's first feature film, ""Knife in the Water"" and he himself had made great strides as a director previously making the film ""Adventures of Gerard"" which he seems to disregard its merits.  But his next picture 1970's ""Deep End"" definitely placed him in high regard as a an auteur himself.  ""Deep End"" with its disturbing final minutes, the reason Skolimowski was drawn to help write (along with Jerzy Gruza and Boleslaw Sulik) and direct the picture in the first place, is an otherwise engaging coming-of-age story/comedy about obsessive love starring Jane Asher and John Moulder-Brown.  Diana Dors has a brief role that is a bit over-lauded, but Moulder-Brown (who appeared in ""Vampire Circus"") and especially Jane Asher should receive extraordinary high marks.  The film is especially well-photographed and edited with Cat Stevens and the Can providing much of the score.  The sad thing here, is that you might be more familiar with the tune by Cat Stevens (as it appears on his ""Tea for the Tillerman"" album) than you would the film which is finally presented here in a stunning Blu-ray with a Reg. 2 PAL DVD from the BFI with loads of extras that the film truly deserves to have created about it.  Also included is a trailer and a very lovely short film starring Jane Asher called ""Careless Love"" from 1976 by Francine Winham.  ""Deep End"" really shows that Asher was quite an amazing actress giving a BAFTA nominated performance.  See it now for an amazing cinematic experience.  And remember, this is how truly valuable is what we leave behind.",1369267200,5,1622,4.912087912087912
