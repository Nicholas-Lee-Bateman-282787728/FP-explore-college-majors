2542737,5,B000EXDRZ8,"30 Days is a wonderful T.V. show that explores touchy subjects among Americans and gives you both sides of the story (Literally).

This show not only explores the differences between people, but it also opens your eyes to some things you may never have known before (Or things you didn't understand)

In one of the episodes, A white christian lives with a Muslim family for 30 days. He learns their customs, language, and learns about their religion. This episode particularly shows Americans  that Muslims are not what people stereotype them to be.

30 Days is a pretty good reality show as well as an experiment combining different type of people, I HIGHLY recommend getting this DVD set. Although there are only 6 episodes, they are 45 minutes each and $20 is a pretty fair deal.",1153958400,10,782,4.770370370370371
2542738,5,B000EXDRZ8,"While most of these episodes of this fascinating show are centered around people from a white, middle-class background, the ""Off The Grid"" episode breaks this pattern. The episode shows two urban dwellers living on a commune in Missouri, and one of them is an African-American woman...

I thought this was a sleeper show, but it's back- I'm glad there's a second season.",1153958400,4,370,4.967741935483871

2542740,5,B000EXDRZ8,"I must admit that I am by no means an advocate of reality television. In my own opinion, a lot of what we view as reality television, I consider ""crap-TV"". There seems to be no relevence or importance to any of it, besides degradation or humiliation for financial gain. Now, someone has finally come along with ""expose TV"" where a subject ""lives the life"" for 30 days. Spawned from the highly publicized, controversial documentary ""Super-Size Me"", this show takes a weekly stab at controversial material and brings it to the light of day. Morgan Spurlock, in my book, is a genius. His down to earth approach to expose journalism is brilliant. Some of the subjects covered are living life of minimum wage, homophobia, American views of the Muslim religion, America's obsession with Anti-Aging, Binge drinking and more. Eye opening,shocking and sad commentary on where we are in our lives, but uplifting in the thought that....it makes you think. Best of reality TV! Highly recommended!",1152748800,20,984,5.0060975609756095
2542741,5,B000EXDRZ8,"One of those shows that gets you right in the pit of your stomach, leaving you drained and unable to think of anything else. Our nation's lawmakers would do well to watch the ""living on minimum wage"" episode, and hopefully they will never view the ""Living Off the Grid"" one. (alternate title:  Better Living Through Chemicals)

You'll think seriously about your relationship with God, and if the outer trappings really mean that much once you visit Michigan, which has many immigrants who practice the Muslm faith. Then you get to wonder why these gentle, learned people are so demonized, and if the ""War on Terror"" is merely another Crusade, ~500 yrs late.

You will meet the most patient person on Earth, Ed, who lives in the Castro District of San Francisco, who takes in a lovable, heterosexual Caveman for a houseguest.  Surprisingly, both are changed at the end of the month (Ed less than Thor, of course).  This episode, like most of the others, grabs your attention and doesn't let you go until the ride has come to a complete stop.  You stumble through the exit and turn off the television, thinking about what the heck you've seen.

We saw all the episodes multiple times (Thank You, TIVO), and have pre-ordered the DVDs.  Our hope is that the DVDs will add loads of new material and teasers for the coming season.  But even if it doesn't, just getting to watch the episodes once more without commercials will be a real treat.

This television series is best for adults and older teens; parents of younger teens will have to decide on a case by case basis.",1152230400,19,1566,4.661818181818182
2542742,4,B000EXDRZ8,"These 1 hour episodes seemed take care to be ""fair and balanced"", showing the given issue from multiple points of view, and stating empirical data -- to make the issues far more than the typical one-sided whining-fest so much of the ""news"" and ""news"" channel documentary shows offer these days. I was very pleasantly surprised how consistently this was done.

Each episode had little ""pod"" sections where a particular aspect of the issue was amplified.  Morgan frequently took part in these, ensuring he had an active part in the series even when he wasn't in most of the episodes as originally planned.

The episode with Morgan Spurlock and his girlfriend trying to survive on a minimum wage income was very interesting. They could have made it (barely) if they had no kids (actually, they have no kids, but they took in a couple of friend's or relatives kids, which resulted in a LOT of stress and spending in just 2 days) and never got sick. Of course in the real world, that doesn't happen. This dramatically shows the impact of modern medical costs to the poor. It also shows how the stresses of true poverty can play havoc with relationships. There were lots of good conversations and normal daily living issues that really brought the reality of miniumum wage living home.

Unlike most of the commentary that goes with DVD movies, etc. these days, I thought that the commentary that went with each episode was VERY enlightening and well done.  It explained the main throughts and philosopy of some of the main folks producing the show, why they did things the way they did, and pointed out some of the techniques and key points that the viewer might not catch in one viewing.

From these commentaries, I was happy to learn that apparently I ""got it"" -- that this show was about reaching out to people who lived radically different lives, and learning from the experience. (Think how much different the world could be if our first reaction to something we don't understand about someone was to try to empaphize with that person, instead of hurling insults (or worse)).

Another key point of these commentaries was that they went with the flow of what REALLY happened in the episodes -- instead of trying to influence things or make them tell some tale that some producer wanted to get across.  Thus, for example -- one episode was only really 22 days and some commentary about the aftermath -- since for safety reasons the 30 days couldn't be completed.  Instead of trying to hide that or force the issue -- the producer and director just worked with that and made it an honest and integral part of the documentary. Gee. Reality TV that is actually about reality.  What a concept.

The DVD set (two DVD's) was easy to navigate, and intuitive.  Each of the episodes had a commentary track, and also a ""missing documentary videos"" track, where the main character(s) in an episode spoke alone to the camera about their current thoughts and moods any night during the 30 days that they wished to.  Though the quality of these comments and insights varied widely, they added a nice extra behind-the-scenes dimension to the season which added some value to the DVD set, in my opinion.

There were only six episodes, making a mighty short season.  This was the main drawback to me. Hopefully season two will have a more filled-out line-up, since this show has proven to be a winner for the F/X channel.

I am editing an original review from watching 3 episodes on TV.  Now that I have the DVD and have watched all the episodes and the extras, I would definitely rate it FIVE stars, but Amazon's editor apparently won't let me change the star rating.",1152144000,3,3648,4.7017268445839875
2542743,5,B000EXDRZ8,"This is fantastic work.  It's so well done and this is what reality tv should really be about.  It's an honest look at various subjects and how society views certain situations etc.

What Morgan has done should give him some kind of award.  He himself and his girlfriend showed America what it would be like (and is on a day to day basis) for people to live on minimum wage for 30 days.  How there is no money for anything but essentials and even then that's scarce.  A visit to the hospital could wipe someone out for weeks.  Not only does the hospital visit cost money, but time away from work means no pay.

He also got other people to trade lives for 30 day periods.  A homophobic lives in gay San Francisco, a redneck goes to Muslim America, a mother drinks as much as her college daughter does.  It really opens your eyes to people who are different to you, how other people live and things we take for granted in our lives.  I really recommend that everyone should see this because there is so much to learn from it.",1150588800,22,1023,4.303664921465969
2542744,5,B000EXDRZ8,"This unscripted show beats all others. There are no contests; no blossoming stars; no forced hook-ups or group shower scenes. There are, however, real people in interesting and uncomfortable situations that make them take a long hard look at some of their closely held beliefs. The gay/straight episode is brilliant and the DVD offers it with a voice-over commentary from Morgan Spurlock, RJ Cutler, Ryan (straight) and Ed (gay). This episode won the GLADD award for Reality TV. It's Fantastic (but I'm biased)!",1150243200,4,511,5.168674698795181
2542745,5,B000EXDRZ8,This is a great show that I enjoy watching. It is very interesting and has something different to offer. I hope they come out with more shows and I can't wait to get the dvd.,1148774400,5,174,4.0
2542756,1,B000EXDRZ8,"I'm starting this 1-star review with a genuine compliment to Morgan. Great concept, and he tackled it with great enthusiasm. The show was also entertaining.  I watched it first-run on television.

So why the 1-star?

This series was designed to ""see what happens when..."" i.e. to discover something we didn't expect.  Too often, however, Morgan walked in with his agenda firmly in hand, and in doing such, many of the unexpected lessons eluded him.  Instead of pausing to consider the revelations that took place before his eyes, he completely ignored them with his political agenda.  Morgan missed the opportunity to be a great teacher, and maybe learn a few things himself.

For a specific example, let's delve into the episode where Morgan and his lovely partner try to live on minimum wage for 30 days.  The agenda was that ""people can't live on minimum wage!""  And he's right!  What he completely missed (ignored) was that people who show up and do a good job aren't paid minimum wage for long.  In the episode, Morgan applies for work and he's one face in a crowd of people trying for work.  He's assigned a job for minimum wage.  What does Morgan do?  He 1) shows up on time and 2) works his ass off!

When he shows up the next morning, they're waiting for him.  The word's gotten out about how reliable he is, and he's offered a better job for a better wage. EUREKA!  EPISODE SHOULD HAVE ENDED RIGHT THERE!  Lesson: You show up for work and do the job and show initiative, you're not on minimum wage for long.  In fact, with the right mindset and initiative, you can write your own check.  The show should have changed at that point from ""you can't live on minimum wage"" to ""you won't live on minimum wage if you strive for greater!""  Blinded by his agenda, Morgan completely missed it, and plodded along with his ""woe-is-me"" agenda, and blind to the lessons the exercise were screaming at him.

Second lesson.  Morgan gets sick.  Really sick.  Sick enough to go seek care.  (Pay atention, Obamacare supporters!)  So he and his partner head on down to the FREE CLINIC.  The line's a mile long and the wait is immense!  There he sits, suffering in a waiting room chocked full of people seeking the free care.  An inquiry about what his other options directs him to go pay for his own medical care elsewhere. So he does. He's immediately given forms to fill out, sees the doctor in a very timely manner and is then sent out the door with his prescription... hours earlier than he would have at the FREE clinic.  LESSON: Money is a rationing device that ensures that care goes to the people who want it most urgently.  Poor Morgan misses this one too.  He complains about having to pay for his care, and pay for his prescription.  And after he gets to feeling better (thank you US medical system), he holds up his doctor bill for the camera to see and exclaims ""THIS IS B*LL***T!!!""

Don't get me wrong, if you watch these episodes, you will learn some very valuable lessons.  Just ignore Morgan's biased views because they go completely over his head.  In this episode, Morgan missed the fantastic opportunity to inspire hope and initiative, and instead sought to depress.  Morgan could have looked at his lovely lady and exclaimed, ""if we want good things in our lives (like good medical care and a better apartment), it's up to us to reach for them!  Quit your coffee shop job (where you're complaining about not getting a raise) and come with me!  Let's show up and work hard and negotiate some higher wages and use the next 30 days to see how much money we could really make by being responsible and trustworthy!!!""

Additional lessons that could have been learned:
1) Not getting a raise at your coffee shop, honey? Go somewhere else!  I'm getting raises!
2) We're responsible for our own destiny.  We're good workers!  We should negotiate for more and give them a job well done!
3) Nobody in the free clinic appears to be speaking English. (that's just an aside).
4) Morgan's political agenda is unraveling before his eyes and he has to work hard to keep it on track.
5) Personal responsibility is more useful than whining and moaning.
6) Some people just won't learn from trial and error... Morgan.

So I definitely wouldn't discourage you from buying this series.  In fact, I would encourage you to buy it and ignore Morgan when he goes off on his agenda rants, and just observe the lesson's and results he's trying to ignore.

I'm not even going to talk about the hippies going around bumming for free used deep-fryer oil to power their eco-cars!  But it's a hoot!

I would give Morgan 5-stars if he'd learned some of the lessons.",1383091200,2,4645,4.599269183922046

2542762,4,B000EXDRZ8,"I truly enjoyed this series, just remember,
when shows are focused on a religious belief system
one has to be aware that the info on the show is of the opinion of the people involved
and cannot lump all persons in that faith as believing the same way.
for example,  i read a review at another site, and a  reviewer felt that the jewish faith
was misrepresented. maybe the Muslims were as well, i don't know.
I also feel that way, as I being a christain, a follower of christ jesus, do not believe
 the way the christains  in one of the shows believe. I felt the atheist in the one show
was exposed to  one kind of christain faith.
so this athiest , if looking at say, the catholic or Protestant faith, may assume all christianity
believes in the same things. [like hell fire and the trinity and  all going to heaven]
 [which i do not believe , or have found, to be a bible teaching] .

2542783,5,B000EXDRZ8,"Season 1 of Morgan Spurlock's 30 Days reality TV show provides us with great insights and education about important social, cultural and even environmental issues facing mankind today. The episodes all move along at a good pace and they each make their point without being overly preachy or rude. Morgan Spurlock himself inserts a brief commentary into each episode.

This two DVD set has a total of 6 episodes some of which come with an optional audio commentary that enhances your understanding of the experience; watch the episode first and then re-watch it with any audio commentary there might be since the commentary won't let you hear what's being said. In addition, each episode has a ""lost diary cam"" bonus feature; this allows people and/or their partners to film themselves during the 30 day experience. It's fascinating!

Here is a breakdown of the 6 episodes that you'll be able to watch on this 2 DVD set:

Minimum Wage: Morgan and his fiance Alex work jobs that only pay the minimum wage or slightly above that. Can they make ends meet during their 30 day experiment to see if the minimum wage is enough to live on? Emergency room visits make things not be so easy. On the other hand, they really scrimp and save, even walking to work instead of spending for public transportation. Will they make it?

Anti-Aging: Morgan Spurlock highlights the case of a 34 year old man whom he calls ""middle aged."" I didn't know I was so old! This man was quite the athlete in his younger years; but he has gained weight and he doesn't feel so energetic anymore. As a 30 day experiment, he decides to try an anti-aging drug regimen. Will this work? The effects on his life are really something.

Muslims And America: A rather religious Christian man agrees to live with Muslims for 30 days. Can he reconcile himself to the possibility that their God is the same as his God and Jesus Christ? What about their religious teachings--are they the same or do they differ? If they differ, then in what ways do they differ? This episode is very well done.

Straight Man In A Gay World:  A young straight man who loves his guns and the Bible travels to San Francisco's primarily gay Castro district to live, work and socialize with gay men. He attends a gay church and meets with their spiritual leader; he also meets with members of PFLAG (Parents and Friends Of Lesbians And Gays). Will this guy emerge from his 30 day experiment still believing that gays are sinners?

Off The Grid: Two buddies (one man, one woman) move to a farm in Missouri where they must live in an ""eco-friendly"" village for 30 days. They must recycle everything and everything--including human waste which is used as fertilizer for planting food for the community. There's no electricity, no gas heat, no electric furnace or central air conditioning, either. How will they make it? Can they last the 30 days and see that they can reduce their ""carbon footprint?""

Binge Drinking Mom: A woman is concerned about her college daughter's drinking. In fact, she's so concerned that she tries a 30 day trial of binge drinking to show her daughter the dangers and pitfalls of binge drinking. The daughter starts out very much in denial about her drinking and the potential problems that can result from drinking too much too often. Can this mother get her daughter to see the light after her own 30 day experiment?

Overall, the 1st season of 30 Days is excellent. I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen and I practically devoured each episode. I highly recommend this for people who are concerned about the issues examined here; and people who want truly intelligent reality TV would do well to get this.

2542799,5,B000EXDRZ8,"Television -- The Box That Dares Not Speak Its Name -- has such incredible power.  It could be educational, bringing understanding and familiarity to people who otherwise would mistrust and disrespect each other from lack of contact.  It could even out some of the disparities in our education system.  It could teach critical thinking by exposing the fallacies of blind acceptance of unproven allegations.

Instead, it does... not.

Except when Morgan Spurlock's on the screen.  His ""Super Size Me"" was a landmark documentary, exposing a corporate giant's avoidance of the truth about its products.  And his series ""30 Days"" extends this same clear-eyed and intelligent investigation to a different subject each episode.  Subtitled ""Try Someone Else's Life On For Size,"" this is exactly what he does, and the results are some of the best TV ever broadcast.

This first season includes the following episodes:
* Minimum Wage - shows how the working poor fall through the cracks and in some ways are worse off than the unemployed
* Anti-Aging - how the pseudo-medical supplement industry preys on vanity with no regard for the health risks involved
* Muslims and America - what it's like to be a Muslim in post-9/11 America
* Straight Man in a Gay World - preconceptions dissolve (on both sides!) when worlds collide
* Off The Grid - how to live a totally green existence, and what this would mean to our accustomed standard of living
* Binge Drinking Mom - a 46-year old mom tries to keep up with her daughter's partying, and predictably fails miserably

2542802,5,B000EXDRZ8,"This is Morgan Spurlock at his finest.  30 Days is compelling, thought-provoking, informative, and entertaining all at once.  It is easily the best reality show currently on television and possibly the best show on television right now.  The fact that it has been passed over for one Emmy award after another is nothing less than a travesty, especially when you consider the shows that actually win (30 Rock? Boston Legal?!)

I do not give five-star reviews often, but I am emphatic in my opinion that this show deserves it.  Every episode tackles its subject matter intelligently and honestly, with Spurlock himself participating in one of his social experiments every season.  After Super Size Me, he took a chance on a reality show, a genre that had long worn out its value and welcome, and the results vastly exceed expectations (it certainly helps that it is on FX, a network with some courage).

Supplanting a person from his or her lifestyle to one beyond his or her comfort zone for 30 days may seem gimmicky, but it's actually a perfect strategy.  It gives the individual enough exposure to effect a real change in his or her perspectives if he or she ever will, and it's worked every time so far, which is telling of us and our society.  Spurlock isn't content to merely shine light on the drama provoked by the scenario - he's after larger issues, and he uncovers his findings with tenacious precision, always commenting on the larger picture with astuteness, whether dealing with religious dichotomies, the sufficiency of minimum wage, binge drinking, or any other number of issues that affect us all.

30 Days is a show that deserves to be seen.  Each episode shows the progress we can make if we just open ourselves up to other people's lives and ideas.  It comments on the very nature of our identities as human beings, flawed but capable of gradual change.  It's an important show that everyone can benefit from viewing.",1213660800,,1936,4.795180722891566

2542823,5,B000EXDRZ8,"I really have to hand it to Spurlock - the ""fish out of water"" concept has been hacked to death in so many formats, be it drama or reality show. However, this DVD presents the idea well and is both entertaining AND informative. For me, the most informative segment is the one that deals with the Muslim religion. It would be difficult for anyone to hold the typical stereotypes that have become standard since 9/11 after watching this episode. The homophobe in the Castro district episode is also a brilliantly done turn on what opens up a man's views to make him not only tolerant but more understanding of people and a ""lifestyle"" that he was once taught to hate. The only episode that had me shaking my head was the one of the binge-drinking mom. Both mother and daughter are totally clueless; the mother's permisive upbringing of her daughter means she will have very little effect on the daughter, now in college. The daughter's steadfast belief that blacking out weekly is not a problem is absolutely disgusting. She's going to need more than luck if her behavior continues this way. The one good thing to come out of this is the younger son's POSSIBLE learning of how destructive it can be to live the life of a binge drinker. One can only hope. The Fountain of Youth show should be an eye-opener for those looking for quick fixes to turn back the clock. The cost can be extremely dangerous and effect others (although at times the wife in the episode comes off a little shrewish, it is refreshing to see that the she and the husband obviously care about each other). Spurlock actually takes the lead in one show trying to get by making minimum wage in Michigan with his girlfriend. Another eye-opener about how expensive just living can be, and the many things that can be taken for granted in America, but not by those just eeking out a $7/hour existence. Still, we all know that at the end of 30 days, Spurlock and his fiancee can pay any of the unpaid bills that are not incurred. Even knowing this, you can feel their stress.

The style of the show is fantastic; the educational cartoons, the interviews on the streets getting people's perceptions, and the commentary by experts are all well done. The extra diary cams are a nice addition, as are the commentaries; about the only thing missing is a follow-up interview, but to be really effective it would have to mean the time lapse of about a year afterwards. Hopefully that can be done for future editions of this show. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Great for discussion after watching.",1194825600,,2541,4.634146341463414

2542907,3,B000EXDRZ8,"I must admit, I am one of those viewers that was blown away by Morgan Spurlock's fascinating documentary entitled Super Size Me.  While some will argue that it was a purely one sided debate, I thought it rivaled that of Michael Moore, causing America to look inward at an issue plaguing our communities.  That is why I was very excited to learn that Morgan was not going to merely stop with the big McBusiness, but also focus more attention towards that growing, constantly changing, and always different community at large.  With ""30 Days"" he uses his same technique patented in Super Size Me which consists of someone following a untypical path for thirty days in all hopes that they will experience and see a new facet of America.  With each episode an hour long, creator Spurlock gives us the reality-based television that we all desire while also giving us a great glimpse of diversity, opinions, and a constantly changing society.  From a binge drinking mother of a party-hard college freshman to that of a heterosexual farm boy living for 30 days in a homosexual community, Spurlock is not afraid to go into a new topic headfirst.  We are given the chance to see if stubborn ideals do change, or if it were just an experiment gone bad.  Just as Morgan introduces each program, we only learn within the course of ""30 Days"".

With a powerful jolt of energy and no-holds-bar honesty, Spurlock jumps directly into this series by focusing directly on himself and a current crisis in the United States, which is the minimum wage.  For 30 days, Morgan and his fiance live at the poverty line, experiencing what it would be like to live without - constantly working and sleeping in bug infested apartments - as a typical American.  While Morgan poses many other questions through the course of this first season, this initial episode is by far the most shocking.  As Morgan and his fiance struggle, we the viewer, cannot help but see the point that he is trying to make.  We see the issue at hand, and just like Super Size Me, he builds thesis backed with extremely detailed points.  As our series continues, Morgan does a great job with ideas, but it is ultimately the final result that just doesn't quite pack the same wallop that this initial episode enormously did.

Other topics that Morgan explores in this series is the concept of a Christian living in a Muslim world, a man attempting to defy the issue of aging with medical technology, and my personal favorite (because it was the worst test Morgan did), the effects of binge drinking on a college mother.  While I will admit that I could not stop watching this series, I had trouble with some of them because it fell into the classic world of ""reality television"".  By watching this series, we knew that by the end the subject would reconsider their lifestyle; we knew that Morgan's experiment would be somewhat of a success, because most television series like to end on a positive note.  We, the viewer, like to think that a person can change and that our world is getting better.  I believe that I would have seen more strength and value in this program if Morgan would have chosen subjects that would not change, or chose not to change even being consumed in a new lifestyle for thirty days.  I sometimes felt that I could fast-forward to the very end of the episode and already know what the final conclusion was, due to a lacking conflict.  What I mean is that in the initial episode, Morgan continued to get hurt, causing monetary issues throughout the experiment, but in the rest, I felt there wasn't this conflict (or eruption of random occurrences), which honestly makes for stronger television.

 Don't get me wrong, I thought that this style of programming is very smart and extremely creative, but I just felt that it lacked in the ""entertainment"" side.  I think I was initially caught into this series because of how unique it was, but later found out that was nothing more than a small-screen version of Super Size Me.  Again, nothing wrong with this, but I felt that by the end of this initial season, Spurlock was running short of ideas, as well as engrossing combinations.  The example that comes to mind was the final (and my least favorite) episode with the binge drinking mother.  Why did she do this to herself?  Spurlock attempted to make connections between college drinking and a mother drinking the same way, but the overall results seemed muddled and very disconnected.  Why would any mother have casual conversations with her daughter about getting ""drunk""?  This whole episode seemed oddly surreal and completely beyond the normality of any mother/daughter relationship.

Overall, I believe Spurlock to be witty, engaging, and completely intelligent about this series, but it is television (and he does ride the curtails of Super Size Me a bit much), and there is only a certain level that your creativity can go before it becomes stock.  I applaud ""30 Days"" for going above and beyond, and I especially applaud FX (whom I believe is challenging the likes of Showtime and HBO) for bringing this series to light.  I will watch the second season, but I will go in a little less excited.  I think Spurlock has a winner with this series, he just needs to strengthen his topics, become a bit grittier with his subjects, and really shock his audience like he did with his initial episode.

Grade: *** out of *****",1159833600,6,5395,4.728632478632479
2542908,4,B000EXDRZ8,"Like most people, I first encountered Morgan Spurlock through his hit documentary, ""Super Size Me,"" in which he goes on an all-McDonald's diet for a full month to see what would happen to his health. It was a brilliant conceit, even if some of his conclusions were questionable (one anti-Spurlock viewer staged a similar stunt, except he kept up his exercise routine during his ""diet,"" with no ill effect on his health, showing it's americans lack of exercise that's causing the obesity epidemic more than fast food.  Nevertheless, SSM was an effective piece of agitprop, so not wanting to abandon a good idea, his show for the FX network, ""30 Days,"" assigns various people ""life experiments"" for a full month to observe waht might happent to them.  While it's mostly fascinating, funny and even educational, you may find yourself asking some overlooked questions.

In the pilot episode, Spurlock himself, along with his long-suffering fiance, attempt to live for a full month making minimum wage.  Between the two of them, they barely scrape by, and they don't even have children to feed.  His attempt to highlight the plight of the working poor (in an infotational manner) is often very moving, even angering.  To think that Congress continues to vote themselves raises while the minimum wage hasn't been raised in almost ten years!  After letting it sink in, however, questions arise.  Aren't there many public assistance programs designed to help the working poor?  Spurlock doesn't even mention this.

In another episode, an average--i.e. somewhat flabby--American has a complete lifestyle change.  He goes on a combination of steroids and so-called Human Growth Hormone, along with a strict diet and exercise regime, to see if he can find the fountain of youth.  It's not giving anything away to report that he doesn't, although he does lose some weight.  It's eye-opening, but Spurlock never mentions what any reputable doctor could tell you: that simply having a better diet and more exercise can greatly improve your health, drug-free.

Some of the other of these initial six episodes involve a Christian living with a Muslim family, and another Christian vecoming the houseguest of a gay man.  These are more successful, if only to show just how ignorant these average men of faith are about some of their fellow Americans.  In the end, they soften their opinions even if their lives aren't changed.

After watching the shows (or listening the optional commentaries), you can decide for yourselves what, if any,questions need to be asked.  For myself, I admire Spurlock's attempt to treat sometimes divisive topics with humanity and an abundant sense of humor (there are many laugh-out-loud moments to be found here).  Still, like many of the participants, while I was enlightened a bit, my life was unchanged.  Those nagging questions could make a heck of a conversation (and argument) starter, though.",1158624000,,2913,5.105485232067511

I think about the saying ""Walk in another person's shoes before you make a judgment"". Meeting people you don't understand can make a big difference in how you perceive them. I found it powerful to see these men change their hearts and minds even if they still disagreed with some of their beliefs.
