8322652,5,B001MZVZK6,"Comes in a tin (not that it mattered).
Episodes include:
- Hungry Ghosts
- Demon Child
- Ghost Soldier
- Where Demons Dwell
If you're a follower of the series you'll enjoy this set.
I particularly wanted to drop kick the kid in Demon Child.  I don't think it was the least bit scary as compared to infuriating.  I did enjoy Hungry Ghosts and Ghost Soldier.",1248048000,2,356,4.378787878787879
8322653,1,B001MZVZK6,"Stupid, boring, and predictable.  Unwrapping shrinkwrap from the metal container, shrinkwrap from the pack, and then shrinkwrap from each DVD case only added to the annoyance.",1241740800,,175,5.730769230769231
