8578926,2,B00C9NQMDA,"I've enjoyed all the other Kanae Minato adaptions I've watched -- Confession, Penance, For N, High School Exam, Chain of Flowers -- but I couldn't stand this one.  There were only a couple sympathetic characters.  The rest were not only non-sympathetic, but ranged from annoying to downright hateful.  I can't recall a drama I've seen where I wanted most of the characters to die more than this one.  The mystery is not bad, but I wish they trimmed all the melodrama and released this as a 2-hour movie, rather than a ten episode series.",1453248000,,537,4.680851063829787
