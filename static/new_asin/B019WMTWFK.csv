7584289,5,B019WMTWFK,"This show never fails- it is the perfect combination of entertainment, education, adventure, and humor! My daughter adores all of the characters and all of the situations they get themselves into. With this DVD her favorite character was the sponge that housed all the little creatures! I love that you get to learn facts about the animals they encounter and then get to see the real life picture of them at the end. She is learning and doesn't even realize it!",1459382400,,461,4.703703703703703
7584290,5,B019WMTWFK,"Octonauts: Creature Encounters is our favorite release in the series thus far! Every time my boys and I watch a new Octonauts DVD, I find myself thinking that they have got to be running out of unique sea creatures to feature in their episodes. Yet, each time a new release comes out, I am pleasantly surprised by the amazing underwater adventures with some really cool creatures! This DVD is so particularly great due to content as well as quantity. You get 8 action packed adventures for about 90-minute of enjoyment with the usual bonus creature reports. The DVD includes the following episodes: Water Bears, Mimic Octopus, Immortal Jellyfish, Jawfish, Sea Sponge, Remipedes, Duck-Billed Platypus and Oarfish. One of the things that makes this show so wonderful and educational is that it serves as a great springboard for further learning. My 4-year old enjoys all the silliness and encountering new creatures, but my older boys (ages 8 & 9) like it because they are discovering amazing natural phenomena that they were never aware existed before. My boys and I often do further research online to expand upon the information given in the show. For instance, none of us had ever heard of a water bear before. Upon researching them online, we learned all sorts of interesting facts about them. For instance, they are also known as moss piglets but their scientific name is Tardigrade. They can survive in the most extreme of climates, even space, mostly due to the fact that they are made up of 17.5 percent foreign DNA (which is a very rare occurrence in itself)! I could go on and on, but you're going want to research most of these amazing creatures for yourself. In conclusion, this show is great for kids and their parents too! I would highly recommend this fascinating children's show to any family who loves to laugh and learn together!
