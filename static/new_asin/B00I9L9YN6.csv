6255033,5,B00I9L9YN6,"I screened this film in my freshman rhetoric courses and it provided excellent material for discussions about eco-activism, as well as how arguments are made in documentary films. The students were able to think critically about their own behavior and engage in thoughtful debate. Highly recommend to educators of teens, young adults, and beyond.",1392336000,3,346,5.425925925925926
6255034,5,B00I9L9YN6,"In a world where it is easy to take in everyday problems and simply do nothing about them, Idle Threat tells a tale of a vigilant fight against pollution. The story told by George is easy to relate to and it inspires the viewer to be active in their pursuit of a cleaner environment. Great music and humor round off a fun documentary experience! Bravo!",1392249600,,352,4.430769230769231
6255035,5,B00I9L9YN6,An enjoyable movie addressing a serious subject- Pakenham's narration makes this an enjoyable view and highlights how an individual can make a big difference to their environment,1392076800,,178,5.62962962962963
6255036,4,B00I9L9YN6,"This documentary is highly informative. It shows how each and everyone of us can easily prevent thoughtless annihilation of our own planet by performing just one very simple step: Stop drivers from idling their cars for extended periods of time.

Kudos to the producer(s).",1391644800,,272,5.181818181818182
8640190,5,B00I9L9YN6,"The amount of oil wasted by unnecessary idling may be close to 33 million barrels per year in America alone. It's a resource tragedy when you consider how vital oil is for so many things, and that we'll never get it back. People are largely oblivious to where energy actually comes from.

The arrogance of the drivers who consider Pakenham a nuisance is telling. They are just dumb takers. I don't know if mere education will be enough. Most people just grab what's available to them in the short-term. They are not genetically programmed to consider scarcity and greed is a big factor in behavior.",1431302400,,598,4.695238095238095
8640191,5,B00I9L9YN6,"It has been said that people don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care...Once you see this film you'll understand why George Pakenham cared enough to become one of The Big Apple's greenest crusaders (or as he more cleverly self-proclaims, the ""Verdant Vigilante"").

Through this work and VerdantVigilante.com, I have learned how one man's dedication to bring attention to an act that is often overlooked as a harmless everyday-occurrance by ordinary passersby, has helped to challenge law enforcement and raise the brow of commuters and enviornmentalists, globally.

I highly-reccomend this documentary to everyone that breathes.",1415923200,,651,5.5
8640192,5,B00I9L9YN6,"This movie is a call to ALL of us to not just sit back and watch when we see something wrong.  I applaud Mr. Pakenham for his unending dedication to his cause.  I just wish that I had his determination, guts and stick-to-it  attitude.  Highly recommend this to EVERYONE.",1400025600,2,270,4.448979591836735
8640193,5,B00I9L9YN6,"George is creative, and dynamic, and explains the issue of unnecessary idling.  For cities with budget difficulties, think of how much money could be raised just by issuing tickets!  It would quickly change behavior, and we wouldn't do it as a society anymore.  It just requires a little change in daily behavior.  See [...] for more!",1393286400,,334,4.910714285714286
8640194,5,B00I9L9YN6,"Many of us living in big cities like New York too often take for granted the air we breathe, unconcerned about the dangerous assault on that air from the constant fumes of cars, trucks, and buses.  With courage and tenacity, George Pakenham has taken on a one-man crusade against that assault, and presented it all in a way that is clear, convincing and entertaining.  If you enjoy breathing clean air, this film is worth watching.",1393113600,,431,4.733333333333333
8640195,5,B00I9L9YN6,"In this unique and inspiring film, we are reminded and shown that one person CAN make a difference!  How refreshing when it's so easy to ""let the other guy do it.""  To think that one articulate, determined man was willing to put his idea into positive action requiring so much patience, time and effort is a joy to behold.  This film deserves a huge audience.  I hope those who buy it will share, share, share and spread this important message on the dangers of idling.  Bravo to George Pakenham!

8640196,5,B00I9L9YN6,"I have lived in NYC for many years, and never focused on an AVOIDABLE source of pollution that is all around us, in this city and elsewhere.
In an interesting and humorous way, this movie shows us what's going on, and what we can do.",1392768000,,233,4.2
8640197,5,B00I9L9YN6,"So many of us sit by idly (no pun intended) and complain about issues without ever trying to do anything about them.  This movie shows how one person can make an enormous difference.  I found it truly inspiring and would love to see it used in classrooms to spur students towards activism.  If you are passionate enough about any issue, you CAN be an agent of change!",1392768000,2,367,4.447761194029851
8640198,5,B00I9L9YN6,This documentary is a must see for anyone who cares about the environment and their health.  I don't want to spoil the pleasure of seeing this by talking about the content.  Suffice it to say that it will amaze you.  It is very informative and told with humor.,1392768000,3,260,4.375
8640199,5,B00I9L9YN6,"Everyday, a line of SUV's sit idling outside of my high school waiting for the school day to end.  Everyday, parents run their cars for 20 to 30 minutes while waiting for their children to file out of the school.  They never give a thought to the fact that their kids walk through poison to get into their comfortable cars or that the heater or air conditioner they are running is simply recycling the exhaust from the car in front of it.  More people need to see this video and spread the word that this simple idea will help us all live cleaner and healthier lives!",1392768000,3,567,4.330188679245283
