8414901,4,B0043GAZXO,"Even though this doesn't have the best audio reproduction and have some issues of their editing this is about the closest you will get to watching a versatile Hawaiian entertainer. Willie K.s Concerts are usually his watered down version of what he is capable and this very short ""live"" Night Club act shows maybe 20% percent of his talent. Anyone who have followed his performance from the San Francisco Holiday Inn days will attest to it....
loved how he brought the Mexican connection to our music as well as his transition from Hawaiian to Italian music.
Reason for 4-Stars is simply because the disc should have been twice as long!
A great companion disc to his ""Live"" CD concert....
If the Recording company decide to re-issue this in Blu-ray format than I would suggest waiting for it.",1300060800,2,792,4.788321167883212
