8428720,5,B004GFO362,"Let me be clear, this is not your usual kind of movie. Oh, sure... it's stocked to the brim with special effects, but let's just say it's no Avatar... what we have here is an intentional sci-fi B movie packed with humour, action and passion... passion from a small team who obviously just love what they do. That's why this movie is different... free reign... no studio executives telling them what they can and can't do, just all out, insane fun.

The story is ridiculous... I'm still not sure if I have worked it out exactly... after watching the whole thing I felt like I'd just smoked a massive bag of weed... I laughed that much! The characters are likeable and very, very well acted... especially the Killer Robots themselves, each brandishing impeccable comedy timing.

If you like slapstick, terrible (but hilarious) overly descriptive dialogue and walk on the spot green screen comedy gold, this is the film for you. If you're a bit more of a Hollywood hit type, you might like to look elsewhere, though I suggest you don't.... The Killer Robots and the Battle for the Cosmic Potato is a well needed breath of fresh air, a far cry from the stale and decaying pile of ""serious"" low-budget sci-fis that have been recklessly unleashed upon the world over the last decade or two.

At the end of the day, this film is worth the watch for the barrel of laughs, fantastic costumes and cheesy, yet colorful and lovingly crafted CGI. A big thumbs up from me!",1310083200,5,1458,4.621621621621622
8428721,5,B004GFO362,"Okay, I will admit I worked on this movie so my review is biased.  I can say it was a rewarding experience and a lot of fun to make.

The movie combines computer animation with live action, but with a Pop Art style and design.  The story follows four fugitive Robots on their quest for a powerful energy source called the Cosmic Potato of Power.

For those who like their science fiction loaded with robots, monsters, amazons, space ships, ray guns, Sigmund Freud, humor and a dash of surrealism, this one is for you.

Rock on!",1266451200,7,527,4.447916666666667
