8536323,5,B0095XHTN4,"I saw Voices of Christmas the final year it was performed in Lancaster, PA and absolutely loved it, so I was thrilled when I found this DVD that S&S Theatre made of it.  They did a phenomenal job (I only wish they'd included everything they did on stage in the DVD).  Since they are no longer performing it, this is the next best thing to seeing it live.  :-)  Highly recommended!",1383523200,,380,4.309859154929577
8536324,5,B0095XHTN4,These are the most wonderful series on DVD from Sights and Sounds.  All of their DVD's are favorites from my grandchildren to us Grandparents.  I think Joseph is the Favorite of most of them.,1360281600,2,191,4.588235294117647
8536325,5,B0095XHTN4,We try to get to all the productions that Sight and Sound theaters has. Glad to have a copy to watch whenever we feel like it.,1358380800,,126,3.8846153846153846
