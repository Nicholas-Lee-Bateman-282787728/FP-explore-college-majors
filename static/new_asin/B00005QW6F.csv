1651753,2,B00005QW6F,"This movie sucked so bad that my hair hurts. The little girl who is going to be married to satan is so ugly. I hope that she isn't expecting to marry anyone better than satan due to her ugliness. The mother is completly insane, like Olivia D'abo would want to have sex with her pock faced monster husband. All the mother does is have paranoid flashes from the movie, but the gay thing is that the flashes are from parts of the movie that haven't happened yet and aren't relevent to anything. This movie is just trying to tell women, ""Hey don't go out and get a job because when you're gone, your beautiful nanny will boff your husband and marry off your daughter to satan."" but then again we can't turn on the nightly news anymore without hearing about somekind of scenario like this one.",1074038400,8,788,4.404109589041096
1651754,1,B00005QW6F,"Who were the actors in this? I'd never heard of any of them, and they were pretty bad anyways. I didn't get anything out of this movie at all. I tried to find some sort of story or message but there's just nothing to be found. It seems to be about some everyday mother who gets some European girl to come over and look after her daughter, but the girl has some kind of relationship with the devil or something crazy like that. I feel asleep about 30 minutes from the end, so I didn't see it all but from what I saw, the girl didn't really do anything wrong. Just because the girl took her daughter to some carnival, the mother goes crazy and gets all upset and I just didn't much of a point after that or even before that. It seems the mother believes she owns her daughter like a slave or something. This is nothing but a jealous mother. Just no point in it, no reason to watch.",1069200000,3,879,4.116279069767442
1651755,2,B00005QW6F,"This movie was bad and the acting was worse and the script writer should be punished.
All through the movie the director is trying to make it look like the mother has a valid reason for hating the nanny, but she doesn't.  She just thinks the kid likes the nanny better, and the kid does.
This movie is a cross between ""The Guardian"" and ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle,"" both superior movies in the horror/suspense catorgory.
The scariest thing in this so called horror movie is a picture of the devil embracing a woman.  That's it.  There aren't even spooky sounds in the night.
However, I gave it two stars because it was soooooooooo funny.",1019779200,4,642,4.517241379310345

1651774,3,B00005QW6F,"This movie starts out promising with a murder by an unseen assailant , next were introduced  to  the  family,working  Mom stay  at home Dad,cute little  girl. Then the  au pair shows up,but she's  not  who she seems  (she was the  murderer) .Halfway  through  the  movie starts getting  bad. Everything  Anna (the au pair ) does isn't  evil or bad ,like taking  Chrissy to  an amusement  park  and  moving the pots and pans to under the  stove,yet the  mom acts like she's  committed  the ultimate  sin. In fact except  for  the  murder Anna really  doesn't  do anything  until the  end. The reasoning  behind  Anna's obssesion with Chrissy feels like  it's  tacked on because  they couldn't  think of anything plausible  so they said ""Let's  make  it  demonic driven"" ,problem  is  there was nothing leading  up to it. They could have made Anna just a crazy girl or even a jealous  girl probably  would  have  worked  better",1458000000,,925,4.675324675324675

1651781,1,B00005QW6F,"I enjoy most lifetime movies and the not so great ones are usually good for making me laugh if nothing else.  However, this one is SO bad (terrible acting, dumb and confusing story) that it didn't make me laugh or illicit any sort of emotion whatsoever for that matter.  It was boring, the music was incredibly annoying, there was no character connection whatsoever, etc...  just terrible.  But by the time I was to the middle and already angry that I had wasted 30 minutes watching it, I had to keep watching to see the end or I'd just be even angrier.  Should've turned it off-wow-so very, very stupid. You've been warned.",1408406400,,624,4.585585585585585
1651782,2,B00005QW6F,"Young Au Pair Anna Bergman (Olivia D'Abo) arrives at an LA household to care for seven year old Christina (Elisabeth Moss). Like most stories, whenever a new female is hen house, the wife (Marcy Walker) develops suspicions and doesn't want to share the household after all. Anna has a suspect past and is not completely honest. She engages in mild manipulation as things escalate in this made for TV horror-thriller.

This is perhaps 3-4 stars on a made for TV scale, but judging by today's eyes, 2-3 stars is best. I have seen too many young girl in the house cat fighting with the wife over the husband type thing that I have grown weary of them. So unless they come with an ""A"" game, I don't get excited.

1651786,4,B00005QW6F,"MIDNIGHT'S CHILD starts out w/ a bang (literally) when a young woman in Sweden is bludgeoned, and blown up! Her name was Anna, and she is replaced by her murderer, a woman named Kristen (Olivia d'Abo). The scene switches to America, where a busy wife and husband are expecting Anna to be their daughter's au pair. Of course, her replacement arrives instead, and sets out right away to cause trouble. The wife grows increasingly paranoid, while the idiot husband remains oblivious to ""Anna's"" creepiness. Nothing very exciting happens until the final 20 minutes or so, when ""Anna's"" true identity is revealed, along w/ her secret agenda. I must say that the reason behind her insinuating herself into this innocent, unsuspecting family was a complete surprise. Sort of ridiculous, yet fitting in a weird way. Worth a gander...",1381622400,,825,5.029197080291971

1651790,3,B00005QW6F,"Being a super-huge fan of The Wonder Years, I was eager to watch this film once I learned that Olivia d'Abo (who played Karen Arnold on the show) was the primary player in the drama.  Had I known this was a Lifetime-produced movie with Victoria Principal as executive producer, or that d'Abo would be speaking in a questionable fake Swedish accent throughout, I might have had second thoughts, but what I didn't know didn't kill me.  As much vitriol as some pour out on Midnight's Child, I didn't think it was all that bad of a movie.  I'm not saying it's a new favorite of mine because it most certainly isn't, but it is certainly watchable (albeit ultimately disappointing).

When Anna Bergman (d'Abo) first arrives at the home of Nick and Kate Cowan, she seems like a shy but sweet young woman the couple can trust as their daughter's au pair.  Little do they know that this young Swedish girl actually murdered the real Anna Bergman and assumed her identity for some nefarious purpose all her own.  After a rough first day, Anna soon begins to fit in quite well, and little Chrissy quickly comes to adore her - a little bit too much, as far as Kate is concerned.  She spends most of her waking hours at work, so it's only natural she would become a little jealous of her young daughter's relationship with Anna.  This goes way beyond simple jealousy, though, as Kate becomes more and more paranoid and hysterical as the days go by.  Before all is said and done, she finds herself fighting to protect her daughter from a danger she never could have imagined.

Midnight's Child has some significant problems.  Kate's behavior appears irrational because there is very little to justify her paranoid delusions, and that makes her an exceedingly annoying character to deal with as the story progresses.  A much bigger problem, though, comes from the setup (or lack thereof, to be precise) of the ending.  You basically have one of the characters undergo a complete personality change, and there is really no explanation for the sudden U-turn in the character's actions and demeanor.  It leads me to believe that a pretty important scene must have ended up on the cutting room floor - either that or the script writer wasn't very good at his job.  Some might argue that the actual ending of the film should have ended up on the cutting room floor, as well, as it is rather silly and predictable.  This isn't a movie you're going to want to watch a second time, but it makes for no worse than an average viewing experience the first time around.",1262304000,4,2542,4.640625
1651791,4,B00005QW6F,"I do not under stand all the bad talk about this movie; I mean come on! this was not intended as a hollywood block buster, it was made for lifetime TV.

7951175,3,B00005QW6F,"2013, huh?  Why are so many ""Amzn"" movies post-dated?  The little girl looks suspiciously like the grown up actress in a recent TV series ""Ad Men""!  And, Jeepers, Olivia d'Abo still looks like a teenager!  The picture quality is more 90's but the script isn't tooooo bad.  Hubby starts out clueless, which always irks me no end, and he gets worse.  Mom is a workaholic, but thank goodness  a co-worker,  with whom she shares weird Anna/Nanny horrors, has the common sense to send Mom home where she finds more evil afoot.  Anna/Nanny's father saves the family and turns into a redeemable character ... finally!  Really 2 1/2 stars",1469318400,,630,4.75
