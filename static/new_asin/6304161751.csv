7866266,3,6304161751,"In this outrageously contrived film, David Heavner wrote, directed and stars as a yuppie computer nerd who is targeted as the prey in some rich man's game.  How the prey is chosen is never clarified, and how it can be conducted is rather incredible.  People sitting around betting on whether someone will be killed or not is a hard scenario to swallow.  The action scenes are redundant, and Heavener is not the world's most talented actor.  Being able to claim star/director/producer status doesn't ensure quality.

Joining Heavener:  Richard Norton as the son of the man responsible for the game; Lynn Holly Johnson with her usual ebullient smile as Heavener's ex-wife; William Windom hamming it up as Heavener's Uncle Billy.

A passable timewaster.",1097884800,,750,5.098360655737705
