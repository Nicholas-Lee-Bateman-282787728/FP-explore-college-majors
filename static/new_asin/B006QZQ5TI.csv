5014587,1,B006QZQ5TI,"(I'm repeating my instant streaming review here because if I had noticed that there were reviews for the DVD version, I would not have bought this)

Sorry to say this was very disappointing. I debated about putting up such a bad review, but I don't want others to make the same mistake I did.
Notable:
- The diagrams that I was very interested in studying were very difficult to read and then there was no reference material to use afterwards. Maybe a key to a location on the web with the plans would be useful. My other people would have better luck with their screen resolution enough so they could actually read the words on the diagrams
- The narration was not clear. Entire words were cut off, words were slurred and hard to understand at times. Narration needed a lot of help - editing was not cohesive and it was just plain difficult to watch (I wanted to turn it off in the first 5 minutes)
- I expected VIDEO of systems - there were a few short video clips - but it was mostly still frames with a lot of narration. Interestingly, the parts that needed the most narration (the bubbler) got the least and the parts that needed the least (the netting/hole drilling), got the most.

It was difficult to watch the entire thing. Youtube has lots of similar info - free. The last few minutes of the ""video"" were advertisements of their systems that you could purchase - not exactly happy about paying to watch their commercials for their systems and hearing ""go to [...]"" so many times.

My advice - skip it. If I thought I could get my money back, I'd try it. This was not available for rental and there is no preview, so I took a big chance that it would be a worthwhile expenditure. My apologies to the authors of this work because I'm sure they have passion about this subject and can't see past their own excitement in building an informational DVD -- but the rest of us should not waste time or money on either the instant play or the DVD.",1338163200,8,1948,4.375690607734807

5014589,1,B006QZQ5TI,"I was expecting to get an understanding of how the plumbing/tubing system is constructed in aquaponics.  They showed the finished product without showing the intructions on how to arrive with the system - PLUMBING.  Not a part of the tubing is described, no name, size of tubes, how they are connected, what their uses are.  It's more like an ""aquaponics story"".  The title, ""Aquaponics PLUMB IT! is definitely a misnomer.  They should have named their product ""An Aquaponics Bedtime Story"".  Free you tube aquaponics are more informative than this product.  It made me so angry to have thrown away my hard earned money for a very useless piece of what seemed to be like one's backyard aquaponics system video only with some story in it.  This product does not even come at par with the quality of information one can get free from you tube aquaponics that you can easily pull out on the web.  Don't get victimized to buy this product.  You'll be sorry like me.  Sorry to the authors, but I'm sure they know what I am talking about.  Better yet, they should pull out this product from the market and save people from wasting their hard earned money.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aquaponics-PLUMB-IT/dp/B006VPMXI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aquaponics PLUMB IT!</a>",1336435200,17,1310,5.305825242718447

5014591,5,B006QZQ5TI,"This DVD has really detailed instructions and is easy to follow. There is a lot of content and it is easy to understand which plumbing method would work best for the backyard. I really liked the extras in addition to the plumbing diagrams and feel like this is a great value for the money. I have bought other DVD's that didn't have graphics, just people talking about what they had built and they were hard to follow. A definite buy if you are looking to put in a backyard aquaponic system.",1325894400,4,491,4.406593406593407

8503443,5,B006QZQ5TI,"Great as an introduction-ish type of video. Look, some reviews went on about production quality or the up-selling of products at the end. So? It's not a Hollywood blockbuster. It's a small business that wants to share information and yes, if you're interested, sell you some of their solutions. They provide so much information that you can build it yourself after some additional review.

That's why I chose 5 stars - not because it's perfect or a glossy representation, but because I really felt these folks wanted to share this info, give credit to those who taught them, and help others. And something about her voice made me want to just sit and listen to her talk...:)

The info goes by quickly. You'll have to take screen shots or pause it to write things down. There's a lot to know on this topic, and no one video is going to teach you. While yes there are free videos on youtube, I like the way this was presented - it made it seem like someone's auntie or grandparents were doing this in their backyard...while at the same time it's clear from the narration that these folks care about sharing this info with schools and even far-flung places and helping other people get things up and running in an easy-to-recreate way. They even talk about getting supplies from ebay and Craig's List - right on!

It gets the wheels turning and provides really detailed diagrams (again, prepare to screen capture!) with a really friendly sounding woman talking you through things. Is it top of the line production? Nope...but I liked it a lot and got not just info from it but the sense that the woman doing the voiceover wants you to go out and do it, too, and then sets about trying to show you how.

I think if you look at it from this perspective it's a very useful tool, and one you can refer to for info later if you stay interested in aquaponics or want to share the info with others but aren't going to create your own instructional video.

One note though: their fish2food.com site is no longer active and I can't find more info on them or their operation after a few simple searches. I'm sure I could if I dug in...so perhaps their business model didn't work, or some other obstacle arose, but these folks put a lot of detailed info out in the world for beginners to use to set up their own home grows, which is a great gift to the rest of us.",1462147200,,2350,4.443155452436195
8503444,2,B006QZQ5TI,Very good information done in an extremely amateurish presentation.  I am supremely appalled that I paid $2 for this.,1440979200,,117,5.157894736842105

8503446,1,B006QZQ5TI,"Nothing but a poorly assembled slideshow and narration with constant adverts to their website. Very surprised Amazon allows such poor quality content be available for purchase. Luckily only rented it, but even $1.99 was an absolute waste! This is the lowest I've ever rated anything on Amazon, but sorry, this is a total rip-off and buyers should be warned.",1357257600,2,357,5.067796610169491
8503447,1,B006QZQ5TI,"The first half is entirely about setting up a system with aeration, pumps, siphons, etc.... it's nothing that can't be found for free elsewhere and is completely obvious unless this is the first time you ever looked into aquaponics.

Glaring deficiencies in advice; they recommend using plastic meant for potable water, which is great. So where does it say Dow Blue Foamboard insulation is meant for potable water?

The most important parts of what to do after you have your system is set up, i.e. caring for fish and plants together is almost completely glossed over! There is little to nothing about raising fish, feeding fish, or troubleshooting plant disease beyond iron deficiency. It mentions pH, adding some fertilizer, and that's about it. There is nothing of substance for anyone with any aquarium or hydroponic experience.

P.S. It's a little 'fishy' that the two five star reviews were given on the same day.

P.P.S. The one good thing this video did for me, was it made me realize aquaponics as it is usually presented is completely ironic. On one hand, it tries to mimic nature by completing a fish/plant nutrient cycle. On the other, people usually equate aquaponics with plastic growbeds, electric pumps, timers, plastic piping, and artificial clay growing media; there is nothing natural or economical about any of that. If this post-post-script intrigues you, you owe it to yourself to read about permaculture if you haven't already.",1352505600,3,1450,5.054393305439331
8503448,5,B006QZQ5TI,"I was expecting to get a talking video because that's what I got before but I was please to find all of the diagrams, although on my laptop I had to zoom in to see the detail, were well done. I like the photos with writing and arrows on them with the exact sizes and directions of the pipes and fittings. I am semi-handy and was able to put together a tank with a makeshift growbed from tractor supply with this video. Thanks.",1349827200,,426,4.144578313253012
8503449,5,B006QZQ5TI,I have an active interest in aquaculture and just recently found out about aquaponics so I decided to convert my fishtanks to aquaponics. I found this video straighaway and it helped me a lot. I had to pause the video several times and zoom in to see the diagram of the set-up but that wasn't hard to do. I wad able to print out the diagram I needed and follow it pretty well. The video shows hown to make the main assembly in detail. Very helpful.,1349827200,,448,4.22093023255814
