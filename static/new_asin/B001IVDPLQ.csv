8311406,5,B001IVDPLQ,"When 15-year-old Owen (Alex Linz) meets Congressman Lawrence Connor (Steven Weber) at his middle-school graduation, the bookish, friendless boy is flattered to be offered a junior position with Connor`s senatorial campaign. Owen befriends the congressman`s young nephew, Caleb, and as his involvement in the campaign grows, Owen`s innocence is shattered as he discovers the dark underbelly of politics, where business and politics share more than financial interests, and idealism and innocence rarely go unpunished. That was the synopsis given. Here is mine. Alex Linz, not seen by me since Home Alone 3, was wonderful as the star struck politics loving kid. Steven Weber is skeevey as the sleezy politician and the bright spot of Escher Holloway (pure talent). I am frightened because I believe this to be a true and real account of politicians. They are in it for what they can get and the whole ""we the people"" thing no longer exists. The end disappointed me but I think this is what had to be. We have no ""bill of rights"" or a "" constitution"" anymore.",1449705600,,1056,4.971751412429379
8311407,5,B001IVDPLQ,"Apparently based on a true story that's even more depraved than what's portrayed here. This is an superb film. Some of the smartest dialog I've encountered, but it took me watching it twice because the interactions between the characters are so uncomfortable (intentionally so) that a lot of the nuance and depth got washed over by the emotional tension of the film the first time I watched it. Really amazingly done.",1428537600,,417,4.887323943661972

8311409,3,B001IVDPLQ,"Choose Connor is a fairly well-written and -directed and very well-acted movie about an extraordinarily idealistic, isolated and naive 15-year-old boy, whose whole life has been spent studying alone, and who after graduation from middle school almost magically becomes intimately involved in the final month of a high-stakes (for US Senator) political campaign. When he discovers that politics is hypocritical, he becomes huffy and self-righteous and withdraws back into his familiar and idealistic bookish isolation.

That core story is very well done, but many details in the movie are so preposterous that they undermine its overall effectiveness. The totally implausible way he goes overnight from book-bound, middle-school nerd to political operative is absurd, but it's not too hard to accept because what follows is interesting. But when a major subplot of sexual predation rears its horror-movie, cartoonishly demonic and COMPLETELY unbelievable head, the interesting story becomes too ridiculous to accept.

That's too bad. There's enough good in this movie to watch it anyway, as long as you can overlook the preposterous parts.",1377216000,2,1138,5.6104651162790695
8311410,5,B001IVDPLQ,Great movie.  Really makes you think what goes on behind closed doors.  Good ending and the director makes a great point to end it like that.,1356912000,,141,4.384615384615385
8311411,4,B001IVDPLQ,"I wish I could say I loved this movie cause the acting is superb and really so believable but it left me uncomfortable and while I believe it is an amazing movie, it made me cry just hoping that Larry Conner is found out and Caleb gets out of that environment, it did not and I'm honestly waiting for the sequel when it all righted but I guess that's not real.",1343779200,,360,4.084507042253521
8311412,5,B001IVDPLQ,"Alright: I am a huge fan of Luke Eberl.  Even in movies that just really aren't that good. I am now every more a fan because  this guy who looks like he doesn't have his driver's license yet wrote and directed this video.
The subject matter is handled cautiously instead of smacking you in the face with it right away.  I also have become a big fan of Stephan Weber, because he is usually so likeable (in a Tom Hanks sort of way)but he can play the most skin-crawlingly evil roles just as well.  I have no complaints with any parts of the production.
If Mysterious Skin creeped you out, then Choose Connor covers some of the same territory without Araki's in-your-face attitude.",1331683200,2,678,4.487804878048781
8311413,4,B001IVDPLQ,"I am surprised that this movie does not have more reviews. I found it quite enjoyable. The young lead actor is quite good, as are the actors who played the slimy congressman and his complicated nephew. The movie portrays innocence lost. A young man who is a high achiever and who has faith in the nation's political system learns that many inside the system are absolutely corrupt and that they shield each other from exposure. The young boy's journey was realistic in many ways -- aside from his oblivious parents.

A WORD OF CAUTION: Please ignore the reviewer who says this movie is perverse and that it is about sexual slavery. That person is wildly mistaken and not that intelligent. In fact, he or she isn't intelligent at all. The movie is obviously too deep for that person to understand or appreciate. Please do not allow that terrible review to keep you from watching this captivating independent and low-budget film.",1327190400,,927,4.79375
8311414,3,B001IVDPLQ,"15-year-old Owen, an academic, friendless (yet oddly-confident) young male, is excited to meet Congressman Lawrence Connor at the former's middle-school graduation. Owen grabs the Congressman's attention with his grasp of current affairs, and is asked to become the 'youth spokesman' for the Congressman's campaign for Senator. This is a dream-come-true for Owen, since he has imagined a political future for himself. He quickly becomes immersed into the spectacle of sound-bites and empty imagery, but is seduced by the attention, media appearances and high-flying parties with politicians.

Meanwhile, Owen is developing a close friendship with the Congressman's attractive, privileged nephew, Caleb - who, two years older than Owen, is sensual and worldly-wise in a way that Owen has never been. Despite Caleb's hints that Owen's new world is nothing like it seems, Owen is blinded by the sparkle of institutional power - and is headed for an abrupt fall.

'Choose Connor' is concerned with illuminating the self-serving malevolence of politicians, through the eyes of a nave young male. Writer/Director Luke Eberle does an accomplished and professional job with this age-old theme, and in the process flirts with some important messages (the system will always protect itself; the need to make symbolic sacrifices) that always deserve an airing. The problem is that the efficacy is wholly undermined by the *vehicle* which he deploys to illustrate Owen's 'awakening': sex, a tired clich, which is more a sop to popular cultural delectation than anything authentic or subversive. The story of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" is a timeless theme; sex as a negative force existing outside of politics itself is a empty one. Paradoxically, therefore, the film ends up by *conforming* to the very institutionalized power relations that Eberle was concerned to undermine; as a consequence, 'Choose Connor' will quickly fade from memory.

The cast generally do well with the material available to them - in particular, Steven Weber is excellent as the consummate, self-aggrandizing, politician; experienced Alex D. Linz (Owen) and relative newcomer Escher Holloway (Caleb), turn in strong performances, despite the one-dimensionality of their characters. Watch 'Choose Connor' for an evening's entertainment - just don't expect anything seminal.",1236038400,6,2338,5.580281690140845
8311415,1,B001IVDPLQ,I hated this movie. It was horribly perverted and left me feeling victimized. This was not a responsible way to handle the subject of child prostitution or slavery.,1232409600,,164,4.892857142857143
