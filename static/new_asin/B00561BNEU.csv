4583570,1,B00561BNEU,"When I read the customer reviews I thought they were exaggerating. So I stupidly decided to watch it. Well I survived the first 7 minutes. The ""restaurant"" scene looked like they made someone's house look like a restaurant. No joke! Then in the mirror you can see the other guy waiting for the camera to point his way indicating that it was his turn to talk. The acting is horrible! If you're in it for the laughs go ahead. See what I'm talking about,but if you want to be scared go see something else.",1380326400,6,502,4.351063829787234
4583571,1,B00561BNEU,Not the least bit interesting. Watch something else instead and avoid wasting your time with this piece of junk altogether.,1379116800,,123,5.2
4583572,1,B00561BNEU,"This was a pitiful attempt at a horror/thriller movie. The ""acting"" was pathetic. In particular, the guy who plays a wannabe cowboy was so bad it was funny for awhile, but then just became annoying. Sexual innuendos and every-other-word f-bombs are rattled off constantly by this guy, and he spewed his lines with no emotion or affect. The other actors were not much better.
I can't recommend this one. Some movies are so bad they are funny. This one bypassed funny and got mired in the BAD.",1377302400,4,491,4.655172413793103
4583573,1,B00561BNEU,"My wife & I made it through the first 90 seconds.  My first words were:  ""I think I've made a huge mistake.""  My wife's response:  ""I think you have.  We must go now.""",1363996800,11,167,3.9393939393939394
4583574,1,B00561BNEU,"This is one of the most BORING so-called 'horror' movies I've seen in quite a while! There's maybe 5 minutes of action in the entire movie! There is however LOTS of jabbering about crap that nobody but the writer cares about. This thing was clearly made by people who want to do DRAMA, not horror, however the low-budget drama world doesn't have as many fans as the low budget horror genre does, so they stick a few cheesy violent scenes in just so they can sell it to horror fans. Avoid like the plague if you value the time it takes to watch this awful mess.",1348790400,13,560,4.2924528301886795
4583575,1,B00561BNEU,"Oh my goodness, my momma must of raised me wrong.  How could I have taken myself through such a poorly made, poorly acted, poorly developed storyline???
One suggestion if you are not persuaded to go to another film either drink an entire bottle of absinthe and make sure the green fairy watches it with you
or down a gallon worth of guiness the dark grade.  I wasted my money on this one.  No wonder there was no preview button.",1337558400,10,428,4.3924050632911396
4583576,3,B00561BNEU,"There is a charismatic personality who comes off kind of like `Stuntman Mike' from DEATH PROOF.

This seducer-of-minds entertains the trio of co-workers into going to some place better than the bar they work at ( It's no MERLOTTES from `True Blood' ).

It was wild to see the changing personalities of characters,Which is a compliment to their acting skills.

There is some extreme violence, And some surprises at end.

You may be fascinated to know the FERAL couple is almost more sane then the DOMESTICATED couple of sadists.

One performer of note,DAVID C. HAYES, Is an Arizona Film Icon and also made the trip in 2002 to be a victim in DEADLY SCAVENGERS.

Another performer,AARON GINN-FORSBERG,Is very charismatic and has been cast in the internet cult hit - WESTERN X !",1315180800,3,774,4.825757575757576

""Haha, what a story, Mark!"" (Any fans of The Room reading this?) If you're not deliberately looking for a bad movie to watch, avoid at all costs. Also, vampires!

8459115,4,B00561BNEU,"There are certainly flaws in this movie, especially if you consider it an insult if someone presents you with a movie that, you know, didn't cost a lot of money to make. To our humble selves it does seem as though there are a lot of people out there who just don't have a ton of money to blow on making a movie, but they're going to give it a shot anyway--and in horror that can be fun because the results can sometimes be quite twisted and raunchy in a way that a studio film has difficulty achieving. Don't get me wrong, this film is not some new Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The script reads like it was written by a very clever college student too in love with his own vocabulary. The acting is passable. It has no nuance, but it is remarkable in that, with a film that gets this twisted, it almost never gets over the top. Not nuanced, but restrained in a way that's never to the detriment of the film. My biggest problem with the film is with the age range of the cast. It looks like it's made by a bunch of college friends. Because of the power dynamic being attempted here, the whole thing would be a lot more believable if the character of Emmett were played by somebody about a generation older than the rest of the cast.
Four stars is a bit too kind, but I'm going with it because I don't like the nasty shellacking it's getting by some other critics. On the spectrum of no-budget horror, I'd put this a notch or two above films like I Told You Not To Call The Police, Murder Eleven or Eyes of the Chameleon, and well below works like Worm, Autopsy: A Love Story and My Pure Joy.",1418169600,,1586,4.20327868852459

8459119,4,B00561BNEU,"There was one heck of a smooth seduction scene in this that surpasses what I've seen in many similar horror flicks. The quality of the video was professional, not grainy like you might find in many others. When the young girl in the seduction scene is bit on her neck, her reaction is very real and believable. I liked this movie. Directors of vampire themed movies can learn a thing or two from this movie that work.",1406419200,,417,4.428571428571429
