4104378,5,B003AOUWYC,"wow. A very thought provoking movie. I can't say more, for I have been left speechless. :)

A lot of people who would love this movie, probably never get to see it because its improperly categorized into the Shudder subscription and the cover picture is also misleading. I went into this thinking it would be a disturbing gory movie, but it was something else entirely. I enjoyed it.",1453248000,4,383,4.632352941176471
4104379,4,B003AOUWYC,"Definitely one of the better low budget thriller movies. There were a few things that were a little strange such as ***spoilers ahead *** they spent a lot of time going through the different types of lights which ended up being pointless to the ending. Also, the CEO was way too strange for them not to suspect something about him and the whole thing with the lighter was pointless. Lastly, the pill being taken and him saying he knew about it made no sense ***end spoilers ***. But overall it was a good movie",1453075200,,510,4.4361702127659575
4104380,4,B003AOUWYC,"This was an interesting movie to watch.  Though I'm not sure an experiment into the base human nature would go this far, history has proven that we are capable of terrible things.  I liked this.",1471824000,,194,4.514285714285714

4104388,4,B003AOUWYC,Every time you think you have it figured out there's another twist. It truly explores how people treat each other. Not much action but lots of physiological suspense.,1459382400,,166,4.964285714285714

8393101,4,B003AOUWYC,"I love the locked room mystery genre. Exam kept me guessing and had me on the edge of my seat all the way up until the end. Every time I thought I had it figured out there would be a surprising twist. Extremely intelligent and well executed. Other similar films in this genre are Cube, Unknown and Kultur Shock!",1487721600,,311,4.288135593220339

8393104,5,B003AOUWYC,"Fantastic ""locked-room mystery"" slash ""psychological thriller.""  I normally find that the endings to these sorts of movies don't match the buildup, but I was extremely satisfied with this one.  Great script and performances.",1473638400,,224,5.757575757575758
8393105,3,B003AOUWYC,"I don't know who wrote those reviews they're quoting on the cover art, but its probably someone involved the production. Its not terrible. Itll have you imagining what you would do in the scenario. Its definitely bottom shelf for the genre, even the sub genre. With an ending that you cant really call a twist. Watch it if its free for you.",1473552000,,340,4.5
