A good percentage of his films deal with the Yakuza in one way or another. None of his films, nor the films of other directors, have depicted Yakuza life as faithfully and compellingly as this one, Agitator.

I say faithfully with reservations, of course. I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the Yakuza, so I don't really know what life is like for Yakuza members. What I can say with some degree of confidence is that life in the Yakuza is pretty much like anything else  long periods of relative boredom (the scheming, plotting, and lying), punctuated by moments of utter chaos (shoot-outs, murders, revenge killings, and beatings). This is the manner in which Miike depicts life for the Yakuza in Agitator.

Agitator is done almost in a documentary style. Sometimes the movie is shot with video tape, other times with what is clearly film. At times Miike uses a hand-held camera, other times with a stationary camera. These devises all lead to an interesting effect

Agitator shows Yakuza lives with real-life problems. The underlying plot is the rivalry between two gangs. Thrown into the mix are the individual lives of the members. Some have wife problems, some have children problems, some have drug problems. Some have hobbies when not working. Between jobs they tell jokes, they talk about music, they complain about their job. They pass the time as best they can. We see it all in this movie. The characters are real people and not action figures.  In this respect Agitator is very much like the Sopranos, which portrayed small-time Mafiosi who kill and steal for a living, but outside of that having very ordinary lives.

Agitator demands your attention, not just to read the subtitles, but to keep track of the characters and pay attention to the inter-gang rivalries. You may have to watch this film two times or more, but it is well worth the effort.

This movie is one hundred and fifty minutes in length. Wikipedia indicates that an extended version of two hundred minutes exists. Ill be darned if I have been able to find it.",1474416000,,2169,4.768

8227253,5,B000X8PACC,I am a big fan of Miike's films and I am impressed with the wide variety of styles he has directed in! most know him from his shock films and he does deserve a lot of credit for spearheading the scene into what it is now! how ever I find his old action films his beat and this movie the AGITATOR in it's 150 minute glory to be his swan song! It's not only the best yakuza movie I've ever seen I think it's the best asain crime drama I've ever seen Our heros are banzi style no holds bared killers with samurai nobility they defened friends who have betrayed them and will gladly stomp a drunk wife beater! This movie is amazing it's funny and it shows there is still loyalty in the world! LIE CHEAT AND STEAL TO GET THIS MOVIE!!!,1258156800,2,729,4.104895104895105
8227254,5,B000X8PACC,"Awesome movie. Takashi Miike is known for making well-done mostly low-budget movies and this is another gem. This one is much slower paced and a lot less action but still amazing. I believe it to be the closest thing to a Godfather Japan has come out with. Our main character is member of yakuza subset family. A rival gang member starts trouble in their territory, a great role played by the director himself, and winds up dead. The heads of the family want retribution and pretty soon the heads of the families become targets and there is a power struggle between the different Yakuza classes. Our man wants his boss to be the main boss and thats where in lies the fun.

Also, the product says uncut. The movies is explicit but the original version was actually 200 minutes, about 3 1/2 hours. It's not on Amazon but if you can find it, get it. If you can't find it then the 150 minute edition is still a very good buy for the Miike fan or the gangster movie fan.",1209600000,4,965,4.361111111111111
