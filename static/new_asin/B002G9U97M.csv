8369708,3,B002G9U97M,"Great DVD for 1st time home schoolers with younger children. It is always great to see what other home school moms do. I did pick up a few good ideas from this and would recommend to anyone starting home school with younger children. Not much at all for older children (3rd grade and up). Mostly for PreK, K TO 1st Grade.",1317600000,,321,4.278688524590164
8369709,5,B002G9U97M,"""Watching this DVD gave me a lot of ideas of how to do things differently in our homeschool to make it more enjoyable and less stressful for everyone. I enjoyed seeing the set-up of your school area. I loved the idea of ""fast school,"" ""running the board"", and rotating ""learning bins"" on days when you don't feel up to teaching. I definitely have those days and my children would love something like that! I'm excited to implement many of the ideas I've seen on your DVD. I only wish I would have had these ideas when I first started! Thank you for sharing!""",1248307200,3,558,4.427184466019417
