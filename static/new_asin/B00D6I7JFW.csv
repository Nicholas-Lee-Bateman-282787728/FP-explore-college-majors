8590042,5,B00D6I7JFW,"Fascinating documentary. I have been a fan of the Grateful Dead for nearly 40 years and I learned things about Mickey Hart and his perspective on music and life while watching this DVD. I also found the array of percussion instruments and the other musicians in the film to be captivating. If you like the GD or percussion instruments, you will love this film.",1404518400,2,360,4.640625
