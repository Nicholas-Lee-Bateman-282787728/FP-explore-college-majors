The most idealistic candidate, a young man (disabled, legally blind from a brain tumor surgery) looses big time (can be expected) but suffers what becomes a fatal seizure the day after the election, yikes.",1438214400,,331,4.910714285714286

8123836,5,B000FJYNM2,"This movie offers a documentary style look into local politics. It does a great job of showing why people run, what they will do to win, and what impact it has upon them when they win or loose. It is educational, but never boring. It just moves along like a television show, but actually imparts knowledge about how the system works, and why it works the way it does. It also shows the human side of what moves these individuals and their supporters. A very, very good movie indeed.",1327276800,,482,4.426966292134831
8123837,5,B000FJYNM2,"This is very interesting documentary about the political process in the local elections for the town mayor.  Small town in New Jersey has local elections.  It is apparent that local citizens are less than thrilled with their current (Republican) mayor.  The race is interesting because the current mayor is legally blind and so is his independent party challenger - a young man who has been battling brain tumor,  Democratic nominee is well known in the city but he seems to be battling illness too which he prefers to keep a secret.

Political strategy, process of getting citizens involved and engaged, the ambition, the drive, and support of the family are all aspects of the story.

The conclusion and aftermath are amazing.  By the end of the documentary, viewer will be so entangled with everyone's destiny that it will be fireworks explosion of the emotions about the events that follow the actual end of the election process.  This film gives a complete story about democratic process of this country, its citizens that are important part of its process and private citizens that are becoming a willing participants in trading their very private lives for a very public ones.  Memo to ""Film movement"" company - this is one of your best productions ever!",1233187200,,1261,4.938388625592417
8123838,5,B000FJYNM2,"The movie is a must see.  Documentary film maker Kristian Fraga is one to watch out for, and you can see his genius at work here.  5 stars all the way.",1183939200,,151,3.838709677419355
8123839,5,B000FJYNM2,"I grew up in the small town of Guttenberg, New Jersey and became involved in local politics from a young age and after seeing this film it brought back so many memories! Anytown, USA is a captivating documentary that goes in depth to show just how ruthless small town politics can be. The film goes on the campaign trail with all three candidates for mayor. Legally blind Bogota Mayor Steve Lonegan(whom I would've supported) was the tough as nails, take no prisoners incumbent who faced opposition from a Democratic challenger in Fred Pesce who clearly had other things on his mind besides the race and a wild card write-in candidate and former star high school athlete, David Musikant who was also legally blind and had enlisted the services of former Jesse Ventura Campaign Manager, Doug Friedline.(Both Musikant and Friedline have passed since the making of this film.)

Perhaps the most interesting sidenote of this film is how each legally blind candidate views their disability. Lonegan resents and even mocks at times what he perceives to be Musikant's attempt to use his disability to win votes while Lonegan gives a brief synopsis of his failing eyesight while making it clear that he doesn't use it as a crutch. Another interesting moment takes place when Musikant starts spreading rumors about Democratic Challenger Fred Pesce's candidacy after receiving a speculatory claim from someone who claimed to be one of Pesce's people and in turn, unleashes the wrath of a furious Mrs. Pesce. You feel for Pesce in this film because you know that something isn't right with him and it becomes more and more evident as the film progresses and you don't see him knocking on doors with his running mate, Joe Noto.(Who is now a Bogota Councilman.) All of this takes place while some residents are outraged over Lonegan's desire to eliminate the town's only high school in order to cut spending. As a result, Lonegan amasses a resistance who is determined to come up against him for the sole purpose of wanting to see him lose and it becomes quite comical at times.

Roll all of these intangiables into one and you have yourself one slobber knocker of a film! Kristian Fraga and Juan Dominguez did a spectacular job of documenting the inner workings of small town politics. Another young talent by the name of Amanda Rosa who assisted in the editing of this film and currently heads her own fledgling production company, Directs 4 Food Productions, did a phenominal job as well and I sincerely believe that she has a bright future ahead of her as a director.

To cut a long story short, buy this film. It's an experience of a lifetime!",1171324800,,2635,4.812362030905077
8123840,5,B000FJYNM2,"""Anytown, USA"" is a wonderful look at small-town American politics. The film is humorous without condescending to its subjects. Each of the main characters is revealed to be a rich, complex person, and the drama of the election will keep viewers captivated until the very last scene.",1163289600,,283,5.042553191489362
8123841,5,B000FJYNM2,"Anytown U.S.A. follows the 2004 mayoral election of Bogota, New Jersey.  The film centers around the races' 3 candidates; the hapless Demcocratic challenger, the caustic Republican incumbent, and the everyman third party candidate.  Director Kristian Fraga has created a comical, subversive work of political commentary.  This movie deserves to be seen by as many people as possible.  Highly recommended.",1162252800,,404,5.796610169491525
