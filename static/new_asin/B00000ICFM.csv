7910262,5,B00000ICFM,We first bought this in VHS when we lived in Toronto where we moved from a house with four fireplaces to an apartment with none. This video was the closest thing to a real fire with all the crackling and sounds of shifting logs. There is one uninterupted hour of watching the logs burn down to embers. You can almost feel the warmth.  It's become a favorite gift for family and friends who don't have fireplaces.,1258329600,4,412,4.421052631578948
7910263,4,B00000ICFM,"I LOVE this tape.  My one complaint is that it needs to be rewound again and again.  I'm hoping they will put it on DVD.  I like this one better than the other DVD fireplaces I've seen.  This one shows the natural progression of a fire....the DVD fireplaces just freeze and re-start after a couple of minutes, so the scene doesn't really change.",1195516800,,345,4.428571428571429
7910264,5,B00000ICFM,"Congratulations Guys!!!  Your ""Fireplace In A Box"" is -->the BEST<-- with a VERY clear, sharp picture, aesthetic log placement--and a natural (not an ""arranged"") look with a SUPERIOR sound track of the snap-crackle-pop-sizzle fireplace activity.  I give your video 6 Stars out of 5 [Amazon not having that high a rating] and recommend it highly!!!",1111536000,,347,5.290909090909091
7910265,4,B00000ICFM,"I must admit, I thought the idea was rather cute considering we don't have a fireplace and the holidays were upon us.  When the family heard that I had ordered this tape they laughed, (and laughed loud :< ).....HOWEVER,  it wasn't long before I heard comments like, ""Hey, this is kinda  cool"" and within minutes we were all asleep in the living room nestled  around the ""fake"" fire!  (The sounds of crackling wood needs  improvement)",947721600,13,433,4.706666666666667
7910266,5,B00000ICFM,"Never before in the history of filmic fireplaces has there been one quite like this!  Fire sizzles in the lead role of ""the Flame"", while Log gives a stunning performance in the supporting role of  ""Wood"".
The deceptively simple plot of a fire burning had more  twists & turns than a rollercoaster, but even so, the singing  emotionally charged ending came as a complete surprise!
This video  literally burns for you.  If you buy only one video of a fireplace, this is  the one for you!",941760000,65,486,4.5813953488372094
