639500,5,6303406408,"I am a certified personal trainer, and I have come, after decades of weight lifting, years of long distance cycling, and trying Pilates, Tai Chi, aerobics, martial arts, spinning, and everything else that yoga,  especially Power Yoga is the best one stop exercise for strength,  flexibility, muscle tone, balance, and inner peace.
This video provides a  challenging workout for even the intermediate to advanced exerciser.  But  there are variations well explained and demonstrated for beginners.  There  are 3 women, 2 doing the int./adv variations, and one  ""beginner"".
Michi does a great job of introducing yoga as  non-competitive exercise, mentioning the integration of the mind, body, and  spirit.  She does an excellent job of explaining the coordination of  breathing and movement.  She's also pretty and fit in a  ""realistic"", not model stick thin kind of way.
This video costs  just over what one group lesson would cost, and takes less time than most  people would spend driving to and from a yoga studio.
A ""must  have"" for any serious exerciser, any yoga student, anyone looking for  a fun way to increase strength and flexibility.....really, anyone.",913680000,24,1163,5.228260869565218

7845731,5,6303406408,"There is a bit of talking but is nice for some explanation.  Guess I watched it way too much then my vhs ate it. Got another and the new vhs at it.. not much but worried about playing it. I love the routine.  And I can't find the standing section anywhere.  I love how they broke sections down. I wish they had it on dvd. Options to not have her explain everything all the time but just say the pose.
Been wanting to do this video again.  The first time I worked my way up to going the whole workout and after a month lost 25lb and was looking great and had fantastic balance.",1420416000,,576,4.026315789473684
7845732,5,6303406408,Have been using this Yoga workout off and on for several years always gets me in great shape! Great for improving muscle tone in legs! I wish it was available in DVD form.,1338940800,,171,4.212121212121212
7845733,3,6303406408,The cover of this yoga workout is very deceiving to the more detailed eye...in that the posture of the woman on the cover is terrible in so many ways...the pose is way out of alignment for the knees and back and feet are not even on sure grounding. Why that pose in such a way I don't know because the workout is actually just the opposite. There are three people..showing modifcations..the woman on the cover leads it. Overall it works slower than I imagined and its not bad at all. While the workout is not for me and my own pace...its good for others. Its a little too talky for me...its difficult to be looking at the camera...do the excercises and que everyone including yourself...this can get the instructor and the viewer a bit stuck. its beyond me why and how they did not see how not yoga aware that picture is. But if you want to check it out do so...its cheap on ebay...about a $1.00 I've seen it for... don't be deterred right away by the cover.,1110931200,2,958,4.35754189944134
7845734,5,6303406408,"I have many many yoga tapes by many instructors and in different styles. Overall this tape is pretty good and I do like Ms. Broman. The setting is real nice and I do like the music as well.

 My only complaint is that I feel she goes into the balancing poses too early in the practice. While certainly everyone is different, I prefer routines that do more warm ups before doing balancing type poses as they require a lot of subtle strength and flexibility beside the fact that you're putting all the weight on one side of your body. I would've preferred it if they were preceded by some Triangle and side stretch poses and a bit more time to get more heat into the body.

 I definitely prefer Bryan Kest's, Baron Baptiste's and Rodney Yee's Power Yoga videos over this in that they are much more thorough and you get much more heat generated in the body.

 Also, of course David Swenson's short forms is an incredible tape if you want a more Traditional Ashtanga type practice. His tapes also are very balanced and the sequencing seems more friendly to one's body (at least to mine). .

 Still, the Buns of Steel tape is certainly challenging, and perhaps for those who are ""looser"" (to use Bryan Kest's term) you might find you don't need quite as much warm up as someone like myself.

 It's worth checking out if you want to add variety into your yoga practice.

7845735,1,6303406408,"I've been using Yoga videos for over a year and wanted something to vary my routine. This tape was very disappointing to me.  The instructor is highly annoying and doesn't seem to be enjoying herself at all.  The whole point of Yoga is lost while she rushes through the positions and mispronouces every word related to yoga.
If you enjoy the ""Buns of Steel"" workouts you might like this as a variation, but if it's real Yoga you are looking for this is not the tape for you.",1016064000,3,474,4.375
7845736,5,6303406408,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this video since its original release date.  After having two children of my own, I realize the importance of fitness, and including yoga into my routine has been of the utmost importance.  Michi Broman is motivational without being pushy, and explains the yoga moves and postures in a simple and relaxed format.  After the workout, you feel refreshed (the deep breathing techniques are incredible) and the strength and stamina you gain as you use the tape each week is absolutely amazing.  I highly recommend it for all yoga enthusiasts....novices to the more advanced.",1008892800,,596,5.11340206185567
7845737,5,6303406408,"This was my first experience with yoga.  My 3rd pregnancy was horrible--bedrest, bedrest, & more bedrest!  This video is really helping me to get the inches and pounds off!  It is also great to get me  started in the morning!  (With 3 kids, I need it!)  Excellent buy!",952473600,7,268,4.479166666666667
7845738,5,6303406408,"This was my first experience with Yoga two years ago. I found it to be very helpful. This tape is my favorite tape to this day, after many classes and other tapes, because the poses are such that as one improves one can  increase the level of intensity of the workout. I recommend it highly.",950659200,,291,4.290909090909091
7845739,5,6303406408,"it was a little short, but definitely a great workout, the poses were challenging and the instructor showed how to make them even more so. becuse of that the video is good for both a beginner and a more advanced audience  since you can decide how much you want (or can) push yourself. this is a  tape i will enjoy over and over again.",946252800,,334,4.203125
