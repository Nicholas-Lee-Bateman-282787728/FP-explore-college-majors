8394574,4,B00005BGNA,"A decent Western, Crazy Horse and Custer, brings to the screen the story of the well known Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, one of the most controversial American historical figures of all time.  Hero or Villain?  Well that's easy; neither and both, since one's hero is another's villain, case closed. And speaking of, this is a pro-Custer approach.

The cast carry out their performances well enough, (though ""Late Sixties"" is written all over it...) the only exception being the general who is not that convincing in his role.

The dialogues could have been better too.

Nevertheless, the plot, the setting, the battles and the costumes are all above average.

Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!

For wonderful Westerns I would strongly recommend The Outlaw Josey Wales, Major Dundee and The Undefeated.",1143849600,,905,5.157534246575342

8394576,1,B00005BGNA,This film depicts a fictious encounter with Custer and Crazy Horse sometime before the events at Little Big Horn.  I found it totally unbelieveable and a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.,1120608000,,177,4.9
