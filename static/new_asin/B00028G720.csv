8023932,5,B00028G720,"Sure, it's awful and choopy, but anybody buying this is most likely doing so for that exact reason.

Like most folks, I first saw this film as Pod People on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I was immediately fascinated with it. There are three different stories going on--a young boy hatches and befriends an alien, a music group is going camping during a break at the recorsing studio, and three poachers discover what they believe is a fallen meteor in the woods. All three stories converge, and nothing very interesting comes of it, but it's good for a few laughs.

So, if you like making fun of movies like the guys on MST3K, this is definitely a good purchase. If not...IT STINKS!",1523750400,,686,4.614754098360656
8023933,3,B00028G720,"""Extra Terrestrial Visitors"" is the original Juan Piquer Simon (""Slugs"") film that was recut and packaged as ""Pod People"", where it became a cult hit following its release as an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". A Spanish film originally called ""Los Nuevos Extraterrestres"", it is essentially a terrible sci-fi movie about a boy who finds an alien who may or may not be evil (I won't spoil the ""tension"" for you). There's a lot of buffoonery in the film as well as terrible personal interactions between nearly all the principal actors: the musicians versus the poachers versus the crabby old man, Uncle Bill, is tortured and formulaic, while still being laughable and over the top.

If you are a hardened fan of B-movies, this definitely qualifies, and while not as painful as some other 1980's films of the genre, it's by no means a pleasure to watch, though some of the tedium is relieved by the intermittently stupid things Trumpy does: my favorites involve eating peanuts, the game of Simon, and the flying laundry scene with clown music. The alien costumes are off the scale funny, and the musical interlude is beyond laughable. Speaking of which, if you're going to watch any version of this I do recommend the MST3K version of ""Pod People""; they pretty much nail everything that's wrong with the movie (and there is a lot) while making it much more palatable for the casual viewer. If you're a dyed in the wool Juan Piquer Simon fan or just want to see the unriffed movie in its original form, this is what you need.",1494374400,,1533,4.720149253731344
8023934,3,B00028G720,"I was thrilled to find a raw copy of MST3K's Pod People, but I received two copies in a row that lock up for a full minute or so a few minutes into the film. When I received the DVD from my original order and had this problem, Amazon wouldn't replace it outright. They would only let me swap it for a different title. I wanted the movie I ordered; I just wanted it to work properly. I tried dealing with customer service directly; they said that was the deal with this movie. They refunded me, and I just bought it again, and when I played the second disc to make sure it worked it did exactly the same thing. So don't be surprised if you purchase it then encounter a glitch like this. I'm guessing maybe an entire run went out with this hiccup. Or maybe it's a fault in the only print they have. Seems like if that was the case just some editing would close that gap.

Anyway, if you've seen the MST3K episode you know what you're in for. I was looking for things that were edited for the show, but it seems like it was remarkably intact with the exception of some strong language, some of which was obviously edited out of the episode. There was an unexpected F-bomb though. I'm not sure if I was distracted and upset about the glitch and missed some other ""new"" material or if it really was more or less aired in full.

So: great piece of schlock I recommend to people with awful taste like mine but be aware of the fact that you might be purchasing a defective DVD no one will take responsibility for. On both counts, it stinks!",1479686400,,1532,4.225255972696246
8023935,1,B00028G720,"Not until I came to IMDb did I realize this movie was not American-made; guess the picture of Ronald Reagan threw me off. And Reagan's movies may not have been great, but even his worst movies couldn't possibly have been this bad.

What is this movie, exactly? A mess. On one hand, we have a set of poachers who find a set of strange eggs in their wanderings, on another, we have a set of terrible rock musicians who go out camping into the woods where the eggs are, and on another, we have a little boy who lives in the woods with his mother and father or uncle or whoever the man is, and the boy has a menagerie of small animals in his room, including a kitten. He finds and hatches one of the eggs, and it grows into a small scruffy aardvark-like alien creature who does things like make the boy's clothes move around as if it were a Peter Gabriel video. He also tolerates it when the kitten starts chewing on his snout.

But who is this mystery alien? Is he behind the killings of humans in the woods (including the band members)? Has another egg hatched, and a different alien the killer? And what is to be done with the first, whom the boy knows he cannot keep around? If this whole thing was deliberately created as a bad picture to be laughed at, the creators couldn't have done a better (or worse) job.",1459728000,,1311,4.261044176706827
8023936,2,B00028G720,"EXTRATERRESTRIAL VISITORS (aka: POD PEOPLE) is terrible, beyond the capacity of all but the most stout, self-hating, hyper-schlock veterans! Yep, alien eggs are discovered in a cave, and smashed by a guy w/ a big stick. Oh no! An adult E.T. takes offense, and smooshes the man to death! Nearby deer hunters notice that something is amiss. Meanwhile, a boy works on his bug collection, and a hip, happening ""rock""  band lays down tracks for their next big hit by singing the same four words over and over, some ten thousand times. The bug kid goes on a walk, looking for specimens, and encounters one of the surviving alien offspring. Obviously, he takes it home and hides it in his bedroom. The rest is an experiment in misery and torment, wobbling back and forth between the bug kid and the soap opera antics of the heinous band. The dimwitted, intermittent soundtrack alone is enough to cause spontaneous combustion!  This movie is only for the bravest trash addict!...",1433030400,,971,4.808383233532934

8023938,4,B00028G720,"Extra Terrestrial Visitors(1983) is the ""original"" version of Pod People. In Spain, this film is known as Los Nuevos Extraterrestres. Director Juan Piquer Simon made a sci-fi/horror film about killer aliens. The producers forced him to add ideas from Steven Spielberg's E.T.(1982) and to tone down the violence. The Film Ventures International version of Extra Terrestrial Visitors was retitled Pod People and it used stock footage from The Galaxy Invader(1986) during the credits.
Pod People is one of the most popular episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Uncle Bill, Molly, Tommy, hunters, and pop singers are stuck in foggy mountains and they are hunted by a hostile alien being. Tommy raises one of the aliens as a pet and he names him ""Trumpy"". Ian Sera(Pieces) plays pop singer Rick. Susana Bequer/Susan Blake(Hostel II) plays sexy airhead Laura.
Frank Brana plays the ""Pod People Leslie Nielson"".

 ""You don't have the authority to declare Happy Birthday!""

 Extra Terrestrial Visitors has the delightfully cheesy, 1980's pop song Hear the Engines Roll Now. This DVD version contains scenes cut from the MST3K version. Trumpy puts together a puzzle with super powers, Uncle Bill drives through snow, and there's an ""F bomb"". Trumpy also uses a Simon game to play Gary Numan-ish music. This film is a solid low budget movie. There's fake fog, a gritty forest, and decent acting. The late Juan Piquer Simon also directed Pieces(1982) and Slugs(1985). Extra Terrestrial Visitors is the best of the worst.",1350777600,,1513,5.188524590163935
8023939,2,B00028G720,"I see people selling used VHS copies here for close to $80.  Why?

Extra Terrestrial Visitors is available, new, on DVD.  Amazon ASIN: B00078809S

I first saw this film on TV as The Unearthling.  Like most bad, low budget films, it's had several titles.

Despite being bad, Extra Terrestrial Visitors has a weirdness quality.  Part Alien, part E.T.  One alien goes on a killer rampage while his/her child alien is adopted by a human, and we're supposed to think it's all cute & cuddly.

Really weird, of the ""so bad it's good"" variety.",1221004800,,535,4.666666666666667
8023940,3,B00028G720,"This odd little Czech film is much like ET but was made before it! Known as Pod People when it was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), it's the tale of two aliens that accidentally land on Earth. One of the aliens, Trumpy, is raised by a little boy who loves and cares for his new friend, teaching him kindness and gentle behavior, while the other is mistreated by poachers, thus becoming angry and going on a killing spree. Chaos and mayhem ensue before the whole mixup gets sorted out and the little boy is forced to abandon his friend to protect him from other people. All this after a rather large body count is racked up by Trumpy's mistreated and angry twin. The whole pop-group-on-weekend-camping-trip-gone-bad sub-plot is amusing and generated terrific comedy when this movie was used on MST3K. That version of the film is available in The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection, Vol. 2, also for sale here on Amazon. This film is not a particularly good or bad film, it's about average, but it is amusing and entertaining and it has a few ideas in it that were good enough to show up in ET: The Extraterrestrial!",1132790400,7,1133,4.641791044776119
