3677477,4,B001L28J2M,"This is a movie about a woman who finds she has a terminal illness. She tries to find happiness in what is left with her life through buying things and trying to live carelessly. I don't want to give away the movie, so I won't elaborate on the developments in the plot.

I will though, comment on it more generally. Saffron Burrows is very good in her role. However, throughout the movie, I just don't feel I got to know her or care about her. Her character did many things, but I didn't feel that I understood her very well, and the other characters were even less memorable to me. Burrows was very expressive, but there just didn't seem like there was enough for her to work with. There weren't many characters, so the few that were there should have served a greater purpose. Some even slipped into slight cliche-type plot development. When I watch a movie like this, I feel like I want to relate to the protagonist character, understand her. While ""things"" seemed to happen in this movie, emotions did not. At least they didn't for me. I wanted to accompany her on the journey, but instead I feel I was just watching her from the outside. I did not dislike the movie, but feel there was some real potential here, that somehow got missed.",1237334400,,1241,4.466960352422907
3677478,3,B001L28J2M,"The Guitar was a surprise to me.  Although the preview said it was about a woman who transforms herself creatively, emotionally, and spiritually.
I expected more emphasis on the spiritual and emotional impact of her experience.

The story begins with the main character, Melody Wilder, having her worst day as, in the same morning, she learns from her doctor that she has a fatal case of incurable  cancer, is fired from her job, and is rejected by her boyfriend.  In her depressed state she completely changes her life.  She gathers all her monetary resources, rents a penthouse apartment, and begins a breathtaking shopping spree.

Melody lived a very lonely life with a dull job and a superficial relationship with her boy friend.  She was just enduring life, with little sense of purpose or meaning.  Melody dramatically changes her life.  First she tries to savor each day and attempts to enjoy many of her dreams:  material objects, pretty clothes, new people, new foods, and exotic sex.

Second, after living her dreams and her plans, she is not enlightened.  She  is surprised at her dissatisfaction and has another short bout of depression.  Living her dreams did not solve her life issues, but she finds some joy in  people and music.  Unfortunately we do not learn whether her second alteration really remedies her spiritual and emotional struggle.  This second metamorphosis is the tougher one, the more vital, and the one with real potential.

The opening is brilliant in showing that dreadful day.  Saffron Burrows is magnificent as Melody.  In many scenes she has little dialogue, but her expressions show her feelings with precision.  This movie is loaded with  allegory and unspoken communication.  The Guitar's striking symbolism and marvelously subtle facial expressions and gestures necessitates the full attention of the audience.

The middle of the film, where she savors her whims, doesn't settle her dilemma.  The story ends too abruptly.  The ending glosses over her real revival.  What exactly does melody gain from her experience?  How does her life change?  The film is a start for a really great movie.  It is superbly acted and acute in its insight.  However, it misses its own significance.

The story would be much better if it lead us through her insights and  rebirth, regardless of the final outcome.  For her experience to be worth telling we must feel the impact of her spiritual and emotional growth.  The film needs to show  her resolution.  Is Melody finally content?  It needs to show her living a new life, adjusting to a new existence.  Has Melody finally found herself?

This is a five star story that should be a five star movie.",1236816000,7,2674,4.961538461538462
3677479,3,B001L28J2M,"This is a film I thought sounded interesting.  A woman suddenly told she's terminally ill decides to take the last months of her life to live in luxury and pursue her desires and dreams.  What I found lacking here was full plot development and depth.  We don't get to see much of Mel before her diagnosis and rapid transformation of her life.  The plot unfolds rather quickly and comes to a neat, almost cliched ending.  I thought the acting was really good and the character likable, but the film seemed self-indulgent at times... long moody ambient guitar score pieces and the main character just hanging around her loft nude for a long while before ordering new furniture and clothes.  That could have been cut a bit to leave more room for developing her pre-illness character and enhancing the plot twists.  I would give this 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-stars, as overall it was just sort of average, from my perspective.",1236643200,,930,4.739130434782608
3677480,3,B001L28J2M,"Although The Guitar had good intentions, the message projected seemed a little bit confusing. The producers seemingly want viewers to feel is that you need to live a little to change your whole perception of life, especially in seemingly tragic circumstances, but how they arrive at this is faulty. Melody Wilder (Saffron Burrows), told that she has terminal cancer and only about two months to live, begins a transformation of sorts, but the main question I have is: who was she before?

At a pivotal point in The Guitar, Mel's doctor questions her: ""So, what did you change?""  Mel's response is ""Everything."" However, while we can sense and guess who she was before the ""transformation"", this side to her is never really depicted, but rather implied. After viewing the film, the question that seems to be begged is: was she was a better person after getting the news of her terminal cancer, or before? After all, what values and reaffirming attributes can one place on sleeping around with married people and spending money and maxing out credit cards recklessly for furniture, clothes and other material items, which is precisely what Mel does after being told she has two months to live. It might have been helpful to know who she was before all this started.

Sure, the vision and flashback to the guitar, (as the movie title implies) is important in her change. The guitar itself might be a symbol of that change, or the goal she had as a child of living life. We are ultimately beaten over the head five or six times with the flashbacks of a young Melanie Wilder seeing a beautiful guitar in a window (once or twice would have sufficed).  Now she can get this guitar, and learns to play,  and she seems to become a more confident, spiritual person who is at one with herself, which is a plus for establishing her character. However, I don't think this along with the spending spree and sex were enough to build much of a story.

On the plus side, Saffron Burrows does an excellent job of being Melody Wilder. She seems to bring a solitary, reflective atmosphere to her role, and she was the right person for the role.

In the end, however, the film's plot was just too mediocre, and doesn't come across as anything profound.",1236556800,,2231,4.676020408163265
3677481,5,B001L28J2M,"This powerful drama starts out sad, but has a truly inspirational ending. Told she has terminal cancer, Melody finally lives her life to the fullest one day at a time, changing everything about her lifestyle, going on a spending spree with her credit cards, trying new foods, making new friends and experimenting with her life as she chooses. By living life to the fullest she stops focusing on death and finally frees her spirit, including buying a red guitar she dreamed of having and learning to play since childhood. The 'death sentence' given to her by her doctor helps Melody transform her life for the better. It's a very 'soul searching' movie and gives the viewer a chance to think about their own lives: are we living each day like we were dying? Loved the ending of this film.

3677482,4,B001L28J2M,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Once upon a time there was a young woman named Melody (Saffron Burrows)
2. Her doctor (Janeane Garofalo) gives her the truth about life and tumors
3. Her boss gives her the axe
4. Her boyfriend needs space
5. After brief contemplation of death, she decides to live a little
6. She rents a spacious loft on a short term lease, and proceeds to fill it with everything her heart desires, including an axe (a Fender Stratocaster 1963, if you want to be specific)
7. She gets special deliveries from the parcel guy and the delivery girl.
8. Life goes on.

Most of the good stuff in this movie can be seen in the trailer, which if made a little longer might actually have been better than the movie itself.  Great trailer that!

Normally this isn't the kind of movie that you'd go out of your way to watch, but the thing that holds your attention is the transformation of the down-trodden young woman of the first few scenes into this sensuous guitar-wielding free spirit, achieved purely through a total disregard for consequences.

Unrealistic situations almost overpower this movie, but it's still a lot better than I expected, largely due to a haunting (and offbeat) performance by Burrows.

Recommended for those with the urge for something a little different.  Rated: 3.5 stars

3677483,5,B001L28J2M,"""THE GUITAR"" marks the directorial debut of actress Amy Redford and focuses on the character of Melody ""Mel"" Wilder (Saffron Burrows), a woman who has one of the worst days anyone can live.

Mel has been laid off from her office job due to downsizing, then when she goes to meet her boyfriend and tell him the bad news, he tells her that he needs his space because she's suffocating him and leaves her.  And what better way to end a crappy day by being told by your doctor that you are going to die from cancer and you have two months to live.

For Mel, having been diagnosed with inoperable cancer in her throat and losing everything in her life, she contemplates ending her life but manages to see an ad about a loft being rented out for a very short time.

Mel, decides that if she's going to die, she's going to enjoy her last weeks by doing the things that she dreams of.

She rents the pretty spacious and beautiful loft, ditches all her clothing (thus living in the loft naked) and with her three credit cards, starts going on a spending rampage.  Ordering a Vera Wang mattress, ordering a genuine leather couch, and so many designer vases, lamps and clothing.  She also decides to change her eating habits by straying away from her vegan life and eating whatever she wants, including expensive meals and putting it all on her credit card.

But each time she sleeps, in her dreams we see how Mel, as a young girl has always desired a red electric guitar.  As a child that is passionate about music, her parents never could buy her an electric guitar but she feels that why not do it now.  So, she buys top notch amps, speakers and a classic electric guitar and learns to play it.

While she lives this life, she constantly meets her delivery man Roscoe (played by Issach De Bankole) and her pizza delivery girl Cookie (Paz de la Huerta).

Roscoe is a married man but somehow is attracted to Mel and the same can be said for Cookie and next thing you know, Mel starts having passionate sex with Roscoe and Cookie, separately and eventually, a M&eacute;nage &agrave; trois.

For Mel, living the last weeks of her life and experience the material things, the foods and the company of people that she would have never have had in her life and knowing how it has brought her happiness but somewhat acceptance of her own mortality.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""THE GUITAR"" is presented in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The film tends to exhibit a lot of grain since there are a lot of low-light, indoor scenes.  But overall, during well-lit scenes, the video is good.

Audio is presented in Dolby Surround 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0.  The film is strictly a dialogue film but music, especially when Mel plays the electric guitar really comes out quite well through your front channel speakers.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Although it is not mentioned on the DVD and nor is it listed under special features, you can access the optional audio commentary by Director Amy Redford under the setup menu.  Really good commentary and Amy Redford sets up certain scenes from the crowd shots, buildings used, having a closed set due to Saffron's nudity in the film.  Very informative and well-done commentary by Redford.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""THE GUITAR"" is definitely a enjoyable film and it's quite rare to see a film like this.  Erotic, stylish, fun...  I have to say that Saffron Burrows really brought her A-game in portraying the character of Mel and what she wants to experience in life as she faces mortality.  She did a fantastic job for this role.

I have to admit, I was surprised by the amount of nudity and love making in this film.  Having seen Saffron Burrows (TV shows such as ""My Own Worst Enemy"" and ""Boston Legal"") in many roles on television but then to watch her nude on the first half of the film and see how erotic this role was.

But as much as the film featured erotic scenes, its the actual cinematography and overall direction from Mel being in this dark place and then being awakened and leaving her old life and belongings and then  just changing her life and living the way she has always wanted for her last two months of life.  There are some memorable imagery from Mel playing the guitar, the candles lit throughout her apartment, Mel throwing her trash out the window and many more memorable scenes.

As much as I enjoyed this film, if I had to nitpick on something is the lack of special features on the DVD.  I wish there were interviews with the talent especially with Burrows.  But for those wondering if the message of the film shows that one who is dying should max out their credit cards in order to have this freedom to own things out of one's financial reach, Mel does face trouble because of her spending and has to make difficult decisions at the end of the film.

Again, a wonderful performance by Saffron Burrows who did a great job in making this role believable and making the film shine!  This is a rare type of film to see and overall, it was quite entertaining.  Highly recommended!",1236038400,7,5003,4.5474860335195535
3677484,1,B001L28J2M,"Even with viewing a second time (to confirm or deny my first feelings), I found this movie to be a complete waste of time with nothing to commend it.",1236038400,,149,4.172413793103448
3677485,4,B001L28J2M,"""The Guitar"" is a great debut from director Amy Redford.  It stars the beautiful, sensual Saffron Burrows (""Troy"" and ""The Bank Job"") as Melody ""Mel"" Wilder.  Mel is having one of the worst days of her life.  She is diagnosed with inoperable laryngeal cancer, loses her office job, and is kicked to the curb by her flaky boyfriend.  How would you react upon learning you only have two months to live?  Mel completely abandons her old life by moving into an expensive, high rise loft, literally throwing all her clothes out the window, and ordering fashionable clothes and furnishings.  Having lost her boyfriend, she explores sexual relationships that were once viewed as forbidden.  Most importantly, she buys that sleek, red electric guitar that she has always dreamed of possessing ever since she was a little girl.

  Expecting ""The Guitar"" to be very dark and depressing, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was very emotionally uplifting.  Thanks to the guitar and its music, Mel goes through a wonderful transformation.  In the face of death, she regains her freedom.  She goes from being an uptight office worker in a small cubicle to a musician playing on stage in front of cheering audiences.  ""The Guitar"" gives me hope.  As long as we are alive, there is always hope that tomorrow will be better.

  Saffron Burrows gives a wonderfully believable performance as the dying Mel.  Isaach de Bankole (""Casino Royale"" and ""The Skeleton Key"") is the black, muscle bound postal delivery man, Roscoe Wasz; Paz De La Huerta (""Choke"" and ""Neal Cassady"") is the cute and sassy pizza delivery girl, Constance ""Cookie"" Clemente.  (Huerta has the most gorgeous lips I have ever seen; they remind me of Kim Bassinger`s).  Roscoe and Cookie are the forbidden fruit that Mel enjoys in some erotic scenes.  Janeane Garofalo (""The Truth about Cats and Dogs"") is Dr. Murray who diagnosed Mel with the laryngeal cancer.

  ""The Guitar"" is recommended viewing for anyone who loves serious dramas that are highly emotional.  This one will make you shed some tears.  It is highly provocative.  After the film is over, you will keep asking yourself, ""What would I do If I was diagnosed with a terminal illness?""  It happens to many people every day.

  As always, Anchor Bay Entertainment has delivered a superb DVD package for ""The Guitar.""  It has audio commentary from director Amy Redford and a theatrical trailer.  It is also presented in its theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  Closed captions have been provided for the hearing impaired.",1235952000,,2539,4.950118764845605
3677486,4,B001L28J2M,"A haunting film about a woman reacting to the news that she has terminal cancer, she has been downsized from her job, and her boyfriend ""needs space"", and all events occur just a few hours. Mel rents an expensive penthouse apartment (with a very short term lease) and goes catalog shopping.  Soon her empty apartment is filled with the finest of furnishings. Her former vegetarian diet is overthrown for lavish take-out food, or actually delivery food in her case as she does not leave the apartment. As her empty apartment fills, so does her life.  She begins affairs with two delivery people and buys her childhood passion, a red guitar.

Eventually Mel's life empties out again, but she is left with the greatest posession; knowing what is important to her. Although there are a few things in this movie that seemed unreralistic to me, they involved her playing the guitar. She seemed to learn awfully fast, but more disturbing to me was to see her playing in her apartment with several huge amps but no complaining neighbors.

This is the kind of movie that I think needs a couple of viewings before it is fully appreciated. I plan to watch it again in a week or two. It may make me raise or lower my opinion by a star, but I look forward to seeing it again.",1235952000,,1262,4.546255506607929

3677494,4,B001L28J2M,"The guitar is a story about a terminally ill woman, and her choice of living the last two months of her life.  In one very bad day she is given the news that she has inoperable cancer, fired from her job and dumped.  She decides to live what she believes to be the last couple months of her life renting a loft and buying anything and everything she ever wanted, including an electric guitar that she has wanted since childhood.

It really is a story about what you would do if you got the news that you had a couple months to live.  It does take some suspension of disbelief to be sure, but if you can get past, or accept the more unbelievable parts it is a good movie.  It definitely has an indie feel to it.  It was not big budget by any means so it helps if you are already a fan of those kinds of films.  Saffron Burrows does a very good job considering a lot of the movie is just her reacting to things as opposed to interacting with anyone else.

It will definitely not suit everyone's tastes and you can pretty much predict what happens as the movie plays out.  That said however it if you like indie movies it is definitely worth checking out.",1395273600,,1152,4.176470588235294

It was also touted as being ""fiercely erotic"".  I wasn't interested in that aspect - I wanted to see an almost otherworldly bond between a person and their guitar/music.

The journey begins with a young woman who completely gives up her former life because it holds nothing for her anymore. Convinced that she has little time left to live she rents a loft, and buys a red Stratocaster guitar. Why? Because as a much younger girl she was obsessed with a certain red guitar. Due to circumstances that are explained later, she puts that dream away. Along with 3 Marshall amps so big they look like refrigerators, she then begins to learn how to play the new guitar. She is not rich. Far from it, but she does have credit cards. Slowly things start to change for her. She's making a transition. Just when she's made some new friends, the credit runs out. Uh,oh. Now what? Without giving the ending away, I'll just say I felt a little changed myself. I saw this film when it first came out on rental. I still think about it from time to time.

3677507,4,B001L28J2M,"Possible spoilers.  The film opens with a 30 something woman getting some bad news from her doctor (Janeane Garofalo) that she has throat cancer and has one or two months to live.  The doc tells Mel (short for Melody not Melanie as she tells people) to go home, get her affairs in order and come back the next day.  Yeah right, take a day and get your affairs in order!  So then Mel goes to her job.  She works in an office in NYC and upon arrival everybody gives her the old back-of-the head stare alerting us that something is up.  She, in fact gets fired or ""downsized"" as her boss tells her in the middle of the office with everyone looking.  Yeah right.  Then she calls her boyfriend on a pay phone (doesn't like cell phones) and arranges a meeting to tell him about her plight.  But before she can get it out, he breaks up with her.  Yeah right.  As you might surmise, I was very put off by this very unreal opening.  Then things get better.  A lot better.

Mel is played by Saffron Burrows who I mostly remember from TV's ""Boston Legal"" and ""The Bank Job."" She gives a strong quietly emotional performance which includes adapting an American accent.  Her initial portrayal of sadness fades quickly into a self realization that she has a short time to live and wants to make the most of it.  We don't know how much money she has but we assume not a lot, but she has a lot of credit cards with some huge credit limits.  She rents out a vacant penthouse loft on a short term lease.  She has nothing with her but the clothes on her back, which she tosses out the window.  She then gets on her brand new complimentary banana phone and starts ordering.  And now I'm really paying attention.  For multiple reasons.  She orders nothing but the best.  Bedding, furniture, vases, lamps, etc.  In one scene she comes out of the shower and realizes she has no towels.  After drying herself off with napkins and paper towels she calls Bed, Bath and Beyond and orders a dozen of their best towels in white and another dozen in silver.  Cracked me up!

It is clear that Mel has no family or even close friends, so she strikes up a conversation with the delivery man, an African with a hint of French accent.  After a while, their relationship becomes physical.  There is also a pizza delivery girl who gets close to Mel...real close.  Then all three become entwined.  It is if Mel saw these as cultural taboos and with time becoming short wanted to experience it all.

Mel never leaves the apartment and after a series of childhood recollections of her mooning over an electric guitar, she buys one.  Not just the guitar but several giant amps, reverbs and all the accoutrements that a wannabe rocker would need.  She learns the basics using an instructional video and progressively improves.  When Mel's credit cards begin to max out she realizes she's still alive.  Her voice hasn't gotten worse.  In fact, it's better.  Her doctors are amazed when she returns for tests.  The cancer is gone.  Evidently all this change in her life has dissuaded the cancer cells to hang around.  Yeah right.

The ending is a little too tidy, but I certainly liked it.  This movie is not the depression-charged melodrama I was expecting after the first 10 minutes but an uplifting, if calculated trip of fantasy.  Perhaps that was the intent of director Amy Redford.  That is, a fairy tale.  In any case in spite of some writing lapses, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1315353600,,3438,4.4991896272285254

On top of everything else, what would you do if your boyfriend dumped you?  Melody Wilder, played by Saffron Burrows, initially considers suicide, but she moves past that thought to a completely different thought when she sees an advertisement for a loft apartment.

Melody decides to spend her last month living like there is no tomorrow, because for her there would be no tomorrow.  The loft she rents with her severance check is in an empty building, so she has no neighbors to annoy with her new, carefree lifestyle.  What is disturbing is the amount of credit she uses, abuses rather, and as the movie progressed, I wondered how much time was passing because credit card companies will eventually catch up with you, though they are sometimes slow initially.

However, this movie is a fantasy and some things you need to ignore to get to the point.

Melody keeps having flashbacks to a childhood experience.  She stole a beautiful red Fender guitar, and got into serious trouble because of it.  Melody buys another Fender guitar and learns how to play it.  She also meets some interesting people and has relationships that recall the 1960's.  Even the people she meets are partially a distraction, but even they lead to the point.

***Plot spoiler***

You have to wonder what the point of this movie is.  There have been other movies made about a dying person living it up, often as a comedy.  Their point was different from this movie (at, least, the ones I have watched have a different point).  What was the point?  Melody's life went off track when she was a little girl.  Stealing the guitar appears to have been a defining moment that changed her life, for the worse.  Was she meant to get a guitar and keep it?  The movie seems to imply that either the act of stealing the guitar or having the guitar taken away put her on a different path than she was supposed to take.  The single act of buying the Fender guitar seems to have been a defining moment that realigned her life.

What critics of this movie seem to focus on are things that appear to be implausible.  How did Melody get a bunch of high-limit credit cards?  Were her doctors incompetent?  There are other questions along these lines.  Some of the answers are easy.  As I noted, her building was empty since the owner was selling it, so no neighbors to annoy.  The credit card question is the hardest.  As for spontaneous remission of cancer, there are documented cases.  Sometimes the remission happens in a very short time.  However, all of these criticisms are ignoring the fantasy, which is the real point of the movie.  Are these same people overly critical of ""Peter Pan"" because there are no such things as fairies and how would it be possible they could fly?

I also saw some snide remarks regarding nudity, remarks that totally ignored the re-birth symbolism.  Yes, Saffron Burrows is an attractive young woman, as is Paz de la Huerta.  If all you saw was two naked women, you should not be watching movies like ""The Guitar.""  Please, go back to Disney movies or daytime soap operas or whatever floats your boat.  The point of the nudity was initially a rebirth of Melody into a completely new person.  Later, the nudity is representative of her freedom, which the director fully realized by the end of the movie.

I enjoyed ""The Guitar"" because it subtly asks who we are and whether we are doing what we ""should"" or could be doing.  Sure, the movie is a fantasy, but for me, it was an enjoyable fantasy.  I can see where the nave way in which Melody floats through this movie without penalty (at least, until near the end when she loses everything except for the one thing that is truly important to her) might bother some people.  I can also see how the nudity and sex in this movie might offend some people.  The people who are offended or bothered by these things should be watching other movies.

I kept watching, hoping for some surprise to make all of the stupidity make sense, but it never happened. How did Burrows' character secure a lease for such an expensive loft? How did she accumulate so many credit cards with such large balances? Why did it take so long for the credit card providers to shut her down? Why is her doctor so inept? Burrows' character is dying of cancer but always looks great and has tons of energy. She parades around naked (de rigueur for her films, apparently) in a New York City apartment in which all of the curtains for the many windows are wide open. When her furniture arrives, she grabs one of the curtains - which is conveniently sheer - and wraps it around herself so she can open the door for a total stranger? This is supposed to symbolise freedom? Perhaps a rape wish. She has sex with the delivery guy and later on with a delivery woman, and then with both, as if casual sex with random strangers and threesomes are every woman's dream. Did a man write this script? Yup. And then there's the rock guitarist fantasy, which is only slightly less annoying than the super heroine fantasy. No training, yet she manages to teach herself how to play well enough to be invited to join an established band, and her neighbors at no time complained about the loud guitar noise while she practiced? And then her diagnosed and verified cancer tumor mysteriously disappears and her inept doctor asks her what she did??? (Yank that doctor's license!) And Burrows' character sells off her possessions for a fraction of what she paid and somehow this absolves her of her credit card debt? I've only mentioned a small fraction of what bothered me.

The Guitar is basically a film about Melody, a woman who finds out she has an inoperable tumor in her throat. Her whole life basically collapses before her eyes as not only does she find out she has only a couple months to live, She also loses her boyfriend and her job as well and all in the same day. My biggest problem with this film lies in the fact that it basically winds up being a film more about consumerism than a film about a woman confronting the final months of her unsatisfied life.

Once she finds out she is dying Melody leaves her crappy apartment and rents a really large and beautiful penthouse. The rest of the film basically takes place in this penthouse as she basically locks herself in and spends the next 2 months charging up her credit cards by buying things for herself and her penthouse. She starts out by buying the most expensive bed that she can find and from there moves on to expensive furniture, clothes, lamps, vases, food and pretty much everything in between. Her final purchase ends up being a guitar and a huge amp setup with which to play it on.

Its just incredibly sad and extremely bothersome to me that this woman spends her final 2 months basically being a consumer. The really sad part about this is I actually think there are a lot of people out there that would do the exact same thing. Society has become so consumerist in nature that I really think that what this woman did would be some people's dying wish. Out of all of the things someone could devote their final months of life to, shopping has to be the absolute saddest choice possible. She could have traveled the world, learned to scuba dive, taken a safari, seen the Sistine chapel, sailed the Caribbean, hiked a glacier in Alaska, taken a cruise to the antarctic, or done whatever other things she wanted to do but never got the chance. To choose to lock yourself up in a Penthouse and shop till you drop is just an incredibly sad way to spend your final months and again it really speaks to the role that consumerism plays in society these days. Some people care more about buying items than truly experiencing life.

Its not a bad film, in fact I actually enjoyed it. I was just really bothered by the message that this film puts out there. Then again as I said before there are probably a lot of people out there that would do just this sort of thing if something like this happened to them so maybe it makes this film even that much more realistic. She did learn how to play the guitar, which was something she was interested in as a child, so she did fulfill at least one of her dreams. Its still wasn't enough to make it offset the fact that she had basically just wasted the final 2 months of her life shopping.

I am not sure if this film was purposely making some kind of statement regarding consumerism or not. I would like to hear from the writer and director regarding their thoughts on this matter. Either way its definitely the prevailing message in this film. I personally despise the level of consumerism we see these days so maybe I am a bit biased however I really cant think of too many people who would not find this woman's decision on how to liver her final months incredibly sad. Our lives are short enough even when we aren't diagnosed with a terminal disease early in life and there are just too many things to do, too many places to see and too many experiences to have to waste our final months shopping.

Dont get me wrong, again I actually enjoyed this film and I think that a lot of other people will as well. It is a good film with a great performance by Saffron Burrows. Who knows, maybe this film will ultimately show a lot of people just how unimportant all of the crap we have in our daily lives really is after all, the only purchase that she made that really meant anything was the Guitar as that was more about fulfilling a lifelong wish than it was about just aimlessly buying something. Actually the more I think about it the more I realize that we actually need films like these as they take a very serious issue and put it out there for people to see, confront, and ultimately to discuss. And that is never a bad thing.

Thru tragedy of what's to come...she orders the best of everything from meat (she's previously a vegetarian), furnitures, bedding, etc., in her spacious luxury loft.  She becomes friends with a married delivery man, and the tom boyish pizza delivery girl.  At the center of it all is her childhood love of the guitar.  In which there's flashbacks.

3677519,2,B001L28J2M,"Melody Wilder is having a bad day.  First, she finds out that she has one to two months to live.  (Apparently, she had been ""feeling crappy,"" saw a doctor and was diagnosed with inoperable cancer.  No treatment is offered to slow the progress, or to make her more comfortable.  Just ""take the day to arrange your affairs and then come back to see a counselor.""  Yeah, right.

Stunned, Melody makes her way back to her office.  She arrives at her cubicle only to be ""downsized"" by her boss in front of everyone.  He hands her a check for 4 weeks severance, shrugs and walks off.  Yeah, right.

Distraught, she calls her ""boyfriend"" who reluctantly agrees to meet with her.  Before she can say anything, he's trotting out believable, original lines like ""I'm feeling trapped.  Not me...my lifeforce""  and ""my therapist thinks I need to get in touch with my inner child.""  So she gets dumped unceremoniously by a guy who only speaks in cliches.  Yeah, right.

Melody has nothing in her life, so she contemplates suicide.  By happenstance, she sees a half page ad in the New York Times advertising the gorgeous, beautiful, spacious loft with a river view...but it's only available for two months rental.  So, yeah, right...I guess I'd spend that kind of money advertising to rent a space I only had for two months.  Anyway, Melody leaves everything she has except the clothes on her back, empties her accounts, and proceeds to move into this gorgeous loft (and it IS) and starts to furnish it to her liking using her huge pile of credit cards.

Finally, the movie seems to get something right.  If you were all alone and about to die, it might be a VERY viable choice to just max out your credit cards and indulge.  Although I must say that the choices for indulgence that Melody makes aren't the ones I would make...but to each his/her own.  She confines herself entirely to her apartment (in fact, she even tosses her few clothes out the window, and until she gets new ones, struts around quite naked.)

Eventually, Melody makes friends with her pizza delivery girl and her UPS man.  In fact, they all become more than friends...although it is nearly impossible to see what draws these people together other than pure hedonism.  But its all scripted in such a way as to make it all an implausible dream.

Melody also remembers how as a young girl she yearned to own this lovely red electric guitar...so she finally treats herself, and spends hours on end trying to learn the instrument.  These scenes, though mostly dramatically inert, do generate some emotion...the idea of connecting to music in a way that you almost feel inside your body.

Saffron Burrows is Melody, and she does a very nice job.  Were the role mishandled, the movie would have been completely unwatchable.  As it is, Burrows dives deep into her character and we frequently see real emotion on her face.  It's the kind of performance that will make casting directors take note of her skills, and perhaps land her some roles worthy of whatever talent she has.

In THE GUITAR, however, the script writer almost utterly lets her down.  The final section of the film is utterly, completely ludicrous in a way that almost made me groan.  Jeanneane Garfalo, as the doctor (in a cameo that is totally jarring) is forced to utter one of the most outrageously stupid medical explanations I've ever heard in a movie.  The movie, when it was all said and done, was mostly just a big slap to my intelligence and to my understanding of how humans really behave.

If you want to see Saffron Burrows take a big step as an actress (or want to see this frighteningly skinny actress nude for long stretches), this movie might be for you.  Otherwise, avoid it!",1249344000,4,3710,4.66820987654321

3677521,3,B001L28J2M,"Mel Wilder (Saffron Burrows) just had the worst day of her life.  Diagnosed with cancer, fired, and dumped by her spineless, pansy of a boyfriend, her life is in chaos.  After a short bout with depression about her predicament, most notably the two months she has been given to live, Mel decides to go crazy and flip her life upside down.  Eschewing her possessions, it becomes a race against time as she rents a pricy loft downtown and begins a quest to max out every credit card she has with ridiculously pricy and ostentatious purchases - essentially a bucket list for women.

Along the way Mel experiments with food, life, sexuality, and most importantly music.  Interspersed with dream-life flashbacks of a young Mel nearly drooling at the site of a red guitar in the window of a music store below her family's apartment, the plot moves toward an association between her spiritual awakening through music.  As she nears her presumed end, it's the music that she savors the most; it's the music and the guitar that she holds on to the longest.

The acting from Wilder is superb.  Considering the fact that she carries nearly the entire movie, her troubled expressions and quivering voice exude sorrow.  When the purchases begin, however, her mood begins to change, and her metamorphosis begins.  The concept is also interesting; told from the perspective of someone who is literally dying, it's difficult to comprehend what one would do (tip: Stay far away from me if I'm in this situation.  The results will be more like a horror movie than a drama.)  The biggest problem with the movie is its slow pacing.  It's unbearably boring at times, with extended scenes of Wilder just reading off credit card numbers while on a banana-shaped phone.  As she orders from catalog after catalog, it ends up being a QVC addict's wet dream.  The supporting actors are average at best, if not a bit amateur.  Aside from the incessant shopping spree and the supporting acting, however, is the problem with the lackluster ending.  It's an incomplete resolution or final outcome, and we're shown neither her understanding of the life changing metamorphosis, nor of her true rebirth/second chance at life.

3677523,2,B001L28J2M,"If you found out you were going to die, you'd probably get some of the things you wanted to do out of your system -- which is apparently the point of Saffron Burrows' character in ""The Guitar."" The underrated Burrows does a magnificently nuanced performance in this film, but unfortunately the actual storyline -- complete with random seductions and cold attitudes -- is a sputtering mess.

A timid and mousy young woman named Melody (Burrows) has the mother of all bad days -- she loses her job, her boyfriend dumps her (despite her gorgeous looks), and she is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing to lose, she leaves her old boring life behind and rents a massive loft, them maxes out her credit cards buying whatever she wants -- food, luxuries, and a red guitar that she's always coveted.

Of course, she isn't planning to pay for any of this -- and with no consequences in sight, she also seduces the UPS dude and the pizza girl, both of whom are total strangers. Of course (as all mice do in such movies) Melody becomes a more confident and assured woman in touch with her sexuality and previously unfulfilled desires, but she has a few surprises in store for her that come as quite a shock.

I'll give this to director Amy Redford -- she has a style that catches your eye, lush and dreamlike and full of quietly beautiful little moments. ""The Guitar"" steps into roughly the same shoes as other films such as ""My Life Without Me"" and ""My Name is Henry Poole,"" but its intensely art-house flavour and slice-of-life unplot (it's all basically about Melody buying, eating and having sex) sets it apart as being a very different kind of movie.

Unfortunately, it's often not a very good movie -- the apparent message is that by spending lots of money you don't intend to repay (kind of sociopathic, no?), you can find happiness, contentment and ""yourself."" Got that? You don't need any kind of enrichment or spiritual balance -- all you need to do is spend vast quantities of money you don't have, and you'll be content. It's like a Cinderella story from the credit card companies.

And of course it also conveys that if you don't have to deal with the inevitable consequences of your actions (potential pregnancy, weight gain, debt'n'poverty) you should coldly do whatever you feel like without regard for anyone else -- steal money, sleep with married men, and so on. It might work as a satire of our modern obsessions with money and ""self,"" but unfortunately this movie is dead serious -- and as a result, it's also brimming over with cliches about a woman finding her true self.

Moreover, it throws random nudity and plenty of explicit sex into the mix, not because it feels even vaguely natural but because... well, it's nudity and sex. As for the ending? It felt like Amy Redford was desperately trying to avoid either of the obvious endings (either she dies or she lives and has to deal with what she's done), but the one she chose was nothing short of ridiculous.

Saffron Burrows is the sole saving grace in this movie -- her quietly expressive face and eyes convey a world of emotion during the story's more delicate scenes. It's unfortunate while her trampled-on character initially is sympathetic, she grows as likable as a boil on your bottom -- she seems to coldly glide through her self-absorbed actions, as if checking different ""wants"" off. And though the red guitar serves as a symbol of the life she's craved, it never becomes prominent enough.

""The Guitar"" has a lovely performance by Saffron Burrows, but the rest of the movie is a beautifully filmed clot of  self-absorption and random sex, which is absolved by the obvious adoration of Melody. Give it a pass.",1243382400,5,3694,4.705882352941177
3677524,2,B001L28J2M,"I had heard wonderful things about THE GUITAR and how well it fared at Sundance. My husband and I also really enjoy Saffron Burrows, who is the star of this film.  Sadly, the emperor is buck nekkid.

THE GUITAR  begins with Janine Garafalo telling Saffron Burrows (Melody) that she has throat cancer and will die in just a few weeks. Minutes later, Melody is fired and minutes after that, her boyfriend tells her he needs to explore his inner child. So Melody leaves her apartment forever, door open, keys on the floor, and rents a huge NYC penthouse loft. She proceeds to fill it with everything she could never afford but that her multitudinous credit cards allow her to have. And so we discover the source of the credit crunch! A good 15 minutes or so are all about her being naked after having thrown her clothes (and trash) out the window. She orders everything under the sun (except clothes) and when it arrives, she's still naked. Still naked when the pizza gets there. Don't worry; she ends up having sex with the married delivery man and the teenage pizza delivery girl. And then she has sex with them together.

You could argue that all her sociopathic acts were just her going crazy with the knowledge of her upcoming demise, but the movie didn't really even hint at that. She was coldly calculating about it all.

THE GUITAR movie has every, and I do mean every, clich you can imagine if you've ever watch Lifetime Television. I was literally saying out loud what was going to happen next, and I had to laugh each time I was right, no more so than we get to the ""surprise"" ending that I predicted exactly six minutes into the show. That is seldom a recommendation for a film.

What are we to take from this movie? That when we're about to die, all bets are off? Melody even forgoes her vegetarianism and starts ordering meat-lovers pizza.  I suppose we're meant to see how liberating her impending death is, how it frees her from societal constraints such as actually paying for what you buy, not having sex with minors, not having adulterous affairs, and being true to your own beliefs.  Is this meant to uplift us? To help us cope with our own impending deaths? Ack! I hope not!

But I'm forgetting something. THE GUITAR. That *is* the name of the movie, after all. We get flashbacks of Melody as a child, with her nose pressed against the glass of a music shop, dreaming about a Red-Ryder B-B gun - er, I mean a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Melody dreams about it every night, but it takes her until about 30 minutes into the film to actually buy one. As with everything else, she has no intention of paying for it. Eventually, she teaches herself to play and ... I can't tell you what happens after that. I can't even tell you what the director, Robert Redford's daughter, says is the point of the movie. That would ruin the ""surprise"" ending.

There is a shadow of a descent movie here, and Saffron Burrows does her best with the material she has. If they had actually concentrated on the guitar, and Melody's learning how to play it, *that* would have been interesting. It could have achieved the director's stated goal. But alas, that was not to be.

If you actually like movies on Lifetime, then you might really like THE GUITAR. Unfortunately, I'm one who has blocked Lifetime from my on-screen program guide.  If only I had done that with this movie, too.",1243036800,2,3385,4.5493421052631575

(Anchor Bay, 2007)
--------------------------------------------
ATTN: Spoilersville, if it matters...
--------------------------------------------
In the same day, a New Yorker named Melodie Wilder (played by Saffron Burroughs) gets fired, gets dumped by her boyfriend and is told she has incurable cancer, and only about a month to live. Being, understandably, a bit bummed out by all this bad news, she opts to drop out from life -- but instead of going to an ashram in the Himalayas, she rents a ginormous, empty loft apartment with a view of the river, picks up the phone and orders everything she possibly can from every catalog imaginable. She has pretty terrible taste (the most expensive of everything!) except for one thing: a red electric guitar just like the one she always wanted as a kid. Although she's cut herself off from humanity, companionship has a way of finding her nonetheless, as she hooks up with the UPS driver and the pizza delivery girl, although her truest companion, predictably, turns out to be the guitar.

It's hard to connect with this protagonist -- she's unsympathetic and remote and her retreat into sheer, unfettered materialism plays out like a Restoration Hardware wet dream, even though, obviously, she's headed for a fall, and must learn that the good things in life can't be bought. Anyway, this is a *very* student-film-y film, and although it has interesting touches, there was nothing in it that wasn't utterly predictable, no real surprises for me, even the big twist ending. (Well, except for in the very beginning when the character was told she had esophageal cancer, and I found my own throat tightening uncomfortably, in a sympathy-pain self-suggestion thing, sort of like when men talk about getting kicked in the 'nads... Ugh!  Can't breathe!)  I didn't find the story and the delivery very plausible or convincing, so it never really drew me in, but I suppose it's an okay movie, worth checking out, if you go for on-the-nose art films.",1242864000,2,2003,5.0820668693009114

I found the main character distant and unsympathetic, and the storyline implausible.
For a more absorbing film about facing impending death, with richer characters, albeit with a story that requires, nay, encourages, significant suspension of disbelief, I recommend ""Henry Poole Was Here"".",1242345600,,494,5.5131578947368425
3677527,3,B001L28J2M,"Have you ever had a bad day?  Poor Mel Wilder (Saffron Burrow) has one of the worst days of her life when she finds out that has terminal cancer, loses her job and is dumped by her boyfriend.  She goes into a deep state of depression but eventually decides to live out her final two months of life in lavish excellence.  This sounds like a great beginning to a wonderful story.  Instead, it's nothing more than the highlight of a hum-drum film.

Mel rents a fancy penthouse, maxes out her credit cards on all sorts of things including fine bedding, gourmet take-out and beautiful clothes.  She also seeks out a red Fender Strat that she's wanted ever since she was a child.  She even goes so far as to fulfill her carnal fantasies, utilizing a delivery man (Issac De Bankole) and a pizza delivery girl (Paz De La Huerta) to achieve her goals.

Eventually, a twist is thrown into Mel's life that makes you think that the story is going to get better.  Unfortunately for Mel (and director Amy Redford), the story remains as bland and uneventful as it is from the beginning.

Despite giving a decent performance, Saffron Burrows failed to captivate me as Mel.  In fact, the character wasn't that likeable at all.  I really couldn't care less about what happens to her in the end.  Issac De Bankole and Paz De La Huerta are solid in their supporting roles, but don't have enough to work with to really stand out from this dull film.

So why three stars?  There are a few highlights in this film.  The beginning is very good, and the relationships that Mel forms in her final days are interesting, but never really fleshed out.  There's also quite a few steamy scenes in this film that I'm sure many viewers will enjoy.  This is basically what saves this film from being a complete waste of time.

Arthouse fans will probably eat this up, thinking that they see something in this film that the average viewer can't grasp.  Call me average, but I just don't see any reason to purchase this film.  Rent it for the supporting cast and then return it the next night for something better.",1240012800,2,2078,4.517426273458445
3677528,3,B001L28J2M,"Low budget, but well acted drama about dealing with a terminal illness. Interesting concepts are displayed, and a slightly unexpected ending make this a unique piece of filmmaking. Unfortunately, a constant aura of sadness permeates the movie. Perhaps, this was the director's intention. Not a feel good movie, but worth a peak.",1239840000,,328,5.326923076923077
3677529,4,B001L28J2M,"If you haven't already noticed, the reviews for The Guitar are all over the map.  Clearly this isn't a movie for everyone, and I confess that at about 40 minutes into the film I was wondering if it was even for me.  But two days after watching it, I'm still haunted by Saffron Burrows' performance and the incredibly subtle way the story unfolds.

Melody Wilder (Burrows) experiences what has to be trifecta of life altering events, all within one morning.  First her doctor (played by Janeane Garofalo) informs her that her ""feeling crappy"" is due to laryngeal cancer, and that she has at best two months to live.  Next, she dazedly reports to her job in a Dilbertarian cubicle silo only to discover that she's being laid off.  Turning to her boyfriend for support, he informs her that they need to break up as he feels ""smothered.""  You can be excused for thinking at this point that you're in for yet another free spending ""max out the credit cards spending spree"" kind of story.  Okay... well that's ""kind"" of what happens, but somehow things progress differently from most ""I may as well enjoy my final days"" thrill rides.

Mel leaves her basement apartment (and everything in it) for a huge loft bereft of anything other than a basic kitchen and chucks what little she has out the window.  At this point, a conventional cineplex movie would feature a scene of gratuitous nudity with an overbearing musical score as Mel moves/dances her way through the cavernous empty space.  But to the disappointment of adolescent males everywhere, it's nothing like that.  Naked Mel basically retreats into a fetal position (all the more odd given the overall size of the loft) and just waits.  Reality sets in with the appearance of the phone installer who she allows in thanks to a quick transformation of some window coverings into a full length wrap.

From there, Mel basically coexists with the world outside the loft through her new banana-shaped phone, ordering food and furnishings (through the largess of her apparently high credit card limits).  The crown jewel of these purchases is a red Stratocaster electric guitar, similar to the one she had desired as a young girl.  While learning to play the guitar through a DVD, she begins to connect with two individuals, Roscoe (the parcel delivery man) and Cookie (the pizza pie deliverer).  From there, the only remaining part of this minimalist plot that I will share is that the obvious max-out day of reckoning will occur for Mel.  Yet there will be a surprise or two.

The plot line is minimal, yet the character development is fascinating to watch thanks to Ms. Burrows (who won't remind you at all of the predatory beauty that she played on Boston Legal).  If my description thus far hasn't given you a clue, just take note.  If your tastes in movies include blazing gun play, explosions, fart jokes and pratfalls... do not... under any circumstances buy/rent/watch The Guitar!

But if you have patience, and appreciate a nominal story line with a subtle performance, I highly recommend this.  The Guitar worthy of its Sundance Film Festival status... irrespective of the fact that Amy Redford (you know who's daughter) is the director.",1239753600,3,3191,4.83609576427256
3677530,3,B001L28J2M,"**Spoiler Alert**

First, I will say this film didn't hold my attention. I thought the acting was good (particularly Saffron Burrows and Isaach De Bankol), but the story didn't do it for me. I found the plot slow and frustrating.

But that's not to say it's not for everyone. I can think of friends of mine who might enjoy it...

If you enjoy deep dramatic films which are mainly about character development, you may enjoy it. Also, (trying not to give too many spoilers) there are a few sultry lesbian & straight sex scenes with the main character, as she explores and discovers herself during her last days.

Finally, Janeane Garofalo plays a small role here - if you like her (I do very much), you will enjoy her here also.

I'm giving it a 3-star score - there's a difference between a ""bad"" movie, and something that just doesn't suit my taste.",1238803200,3,849,4.522875816993464
3677531,5,B001L28J2M,"The opening scenes of THE GUITAR set a mood of near total collapse of one woman's entire support system, as she loses her job, her boyfriend, and her dream of a long life in a sudden and devastating fell swoop of massive misfortune. Taking this rather shocking series of events as a catalyst for pursuing moth-balled dreams and childhood fantasies, our heroine, Melody Wilder, begins a brand new life for herself which is completely free from all the burdens and pressures and drudgery of her past.

Without divulging the heart of the story, so as to refrain from spoiling the film for those who wish to savor its full sensual experience, our heroine begins an inner and outer journey to overcome all manner of prior self restrictions and limitations. Some of these restrictions and limitations are evident in matters of social rules and expectations, and others are less outwardly visible, as they comprise the very fabric of Melody's mind and heart.

This movie is highly recommended to everyone who has ever felt hemmed in by life's duties, responsibilities and rules... and is an homage to free spirits everywhere who march to the beat of their own drummers.

I love the dreamy, surreal cinematography in this film, and the casting of each of the key acting roles. THE GUITAR has the look and feel of a small indie film, with the emotional impact of a blockbuster -- a must see!",1238630400,5,1382,4.7740585774058575

Deciding to give up her lackluster and depressing life, she plans to live out her last days to their fullest.

One of her purchases is a red guitar which she learns to play with abandon, getting a new lease on life.

This movie is pretty uneven, and without spoiling anything, has an implausible conclusion that just sort of makes the rest of the movie fall apart, which is a little disappointing since it really started with a bang. The extras are non-existent for the most part - just the movie's trailer.",1238457600,3,816,4.589041095890411
3677534,2,B001L28J2M,"After about 30 minutes or so I gave up on this film.  Nothing drawing me in, nothing I cared about, just didn't seem like a relevant commentary on life or death.  I loved ""Six Feet Under"" and I thought Emma Thompson's ""Wit"" was a superb character film with a gut wrenching depiction of one person's death.  In comparison ""The Guitar"" is a cold bland sandwich.  It looks good at first until you actually taste it.

A story about a character's death usually explores emotions.  What are they feeling?  Why (other than they're dying) are they feeling it?  So this woman never learned to play the guitar and then uses the last few months of her life to do so.  (Yeah right. As if she could learn that fast.)

My review here for ""The Guitar"" isn't to give it all away.
