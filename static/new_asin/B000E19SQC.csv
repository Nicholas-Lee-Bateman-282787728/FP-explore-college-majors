8103754,5,B000E19SQC,"This film [...] me in to the world of the Gitano.  Having Gypsy heritage myself I enjoyed the passion, conflict and honor portrayed.  I purchased the DVD out of curiosity about the acting ability of Joaquin Cortes and to see him in a different performance venue than his amazing dancing.  He did a wonderful job as the central character.  I watched this one twice before I picked up all of the details of the story.  Watching it a third time will be purely for the love of the feel of the film as the scenery, actors and music are beautiful.  I recommend this film on many levels.",1168300800,7,580,4.373831775700935
