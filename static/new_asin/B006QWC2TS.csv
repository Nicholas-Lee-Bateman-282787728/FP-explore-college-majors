8503329,5,B006QWC2TS,Another collection of episodes from the late 1990's American cartoon. The characterization of Pippi is most fun. Her whimsy and the careful use of her super strength is fine to see as is her philosophy of life. Adventures on the high seas in the Atlantic where her father is always with his ship from their island of Curra-Curra-Dutt to Sweden where Pippi lives.,1447545600,,362,4.761904761904762

8503331,5,B006QWC2TS,"Pippi Longstocking has long been a favorite character in our home.  Her adventures are wild and wacky and fun!  Quite often Pippi's point of view sparks great conversation between the older and younger members of the house with surprising opinions revealed.  Even though considered a ""cartoon character"" Pippi is a positive influence in many ways.  She is seemingly unafraid and willing to tackle any situation with a good attitude of success and that is very refreshing in today's ever stressful environment.  We are happy to add this DVD to our collection.",1421020800,,558,5.087912087912088
