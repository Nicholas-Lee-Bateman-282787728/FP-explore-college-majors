5677810,5,B00BVMXBDO,"I'm hard to impress about TV shows, especially beginnings. First episodes-- even for good ones-- can be awkward, with the cast and writers not yet finding the chemistry.

This one hit managed to hit maximum speed seconds after it began, and then spent the rest of the show proving there was more to spare. Somehow, it did this without sacrificing character development. Thanks to co-creator John Fawcett's taut direction, and remarkable performances by Tatiana Maslani as three physically identical women with distinct personalities, accents and mannerisms. She even plays one mimicking another, with her cockney accent wavering.

The story is about Sarah, a young woman surviving on the margins as a hustler and a drug dealer, who's just walked out on her boyfriend. She witnesses a stranger identical to herself, Beth, commit suicide. Sarah steals and assumes her identity. Despite the fact that Sarah had little to lose, it turns out this was not the best move. The mysterious pink cellphone and a recently loaded savings account hint at the weird secrets that drove Elizabeth to suicide.

The show has one gamble in its structure, that is, Sarah is not a likeable character. Even if you can't warm up to her anti-heroism, you might still enjoy the trouble she brings on herself and still admire the cleverness she shows. Maslani's remarkable performance generates fascination. I expect that as the plot continues to unfold, we'll see Sarah's other better qualities.

Maslani seems like a chameleon, and co-Creator, Fawcett, is the best filmmaker out of Canada, having made the timeless horror movie ""Ginger Snaps.""  I'm hooked. I've already bought it for the rest of the season.",1365465600,201,1682,5.124087591240876
5677811,4,B00BVMXBDO,"Coma, Resident Evil series, Dark Angel  series, In all after some research there are only 20 human cloning TV and films ever made. Almost 300 including animals and monsters. So out of millions of films and TV  shows this subject matter is very rare. But the premise is at least interesting. All the comments I've read said the support clones where poorly developed. It takes time unless the actor has a feeling for a character from the start to create a new personna. So please give the lady a little understanding. They work between 10 and 14 hours a day. And as the actor playing the majority of roles they are demanding a lot of her. I have hope that the series will improve.

A few bits of information you may not know. Cloning people is illegal in most countries because it is disruptive of the inheritance laws - so my bet is that is  why the women are being killed but it could be to hide their dark secret as well or it could be one of the women has a deep need to be the only one. Any of those possibilities well make a good story.

Now I do have a complaint. I don't plain to ever buy a blue ray player and I'm a long time collector of DVD's. Please make DVD's available. Thank you.",1365379200,3,1192,4.2105263157894735
5677812,4,B00BVMXBDO,"NO SPOILERS:

BBC America hit a home run with ""Copper"" and had a strong showing with ""Ripper"".  Both were historical period pieces.  Orphan Black wraps a mystery around cloning.  The BBC is going a long way towards making a claim to be at top in the program originality department

So far the casting pool doesn't appear to overly deep with Tatiana Maslany doing all the heavy lifting as Sarah Manning and her clones Elizabeth Childs/Alison Hendrix/Katja Obinger/Cosima

Before I cast judgment on the writing I would like to see a few more episodes and plot direction.  However, so far I like the direction.  There are some comic lines worked in with the serious nature of the mystery (hence the comment by Beth's BF on her attire)

As for Tatiana Maslany, I was a fan before Orphan Black.  I thought that she actually carried Mark Harmon with her portrayal of contract killer Clara Rinkle in the telemovie of John Sandford's ""Certain Prey""

I generally like to watch a few more episodes before I submit a review and Orphan Black is subject to an upgrade (or downgrade) depending on how the series progresses.  However, I wanted to come out early with a recommendation to at the very least give the show (and Tatiana Maslany) a chance",1365292800,3,1234,4.714953271028038

5677814,3,B00BVMXBDO,"Although Orphan Black has enough tension to keep the plot interesting and it's very well acted, I felt the characters weren't that well developed. I didn't get a real sense of who they were, why they did what they did nor did I really like any of them. I didn't care whether they succeeded or failed. The story tended to jump around from scene to scene abruptly without connection between the scenes . This made the story difficult to follow. Still, I may watch one or two more episodes. I found it interesting enough to want to watch at least one more episode.",1365206400,6,561,4.456310679611651
5677815,5,B00BVMXBDO,"Orphan Black on BBC America is created by John Fawcett (Xenia Warrior Prince, Lost Girl) and Graeme Manson (Flashpoint, Endgame) and centers around a troubled single mother Sarah, played beautifully by the beautiful Tatiana Maslany (Defendor, The Vow). Her range in acting is evident immediately, her eyes smolder with intensity and with fear and anger and sadness, and whatever else the scene may require. Almost immediately we are thrown in to Sarah's plight and just as confused as she is. A strong series opening episode, albeit confusing, I think that is the point. This show is told from Sarah's view point and the idea is to figure out the plot of the show with Sarah as she figures it out for herself.

*Episode Review*

""Natural Selection"" written by John Fawcett and Graeme Manson and directed by John Fawcett starts out with Sarah, a street smart estranged single mother witnessing the suicide of a woman on a train platform in Canada who happens to look exactly like her. Felix played by Jordan Gavaris (Degrassi: The Next Generation) plays Sarah's foster brother who helps her escape her life by assuming the newly dead doppelgangers identity. In an attempt to take over this persons life and emptying her bank account, Sarah inadvertently inherits all the problems that come along with taking over someone elses identity. The denouement of the episode answers some lingering questions and also flips everything on it head and poses even more questions with a very intense awesome action scene that comes way out of left field from an otherwise very methodically paced episode. For a first episode, I was immediately drawn in and intrigued, this show is a great pairing with Doctor Who on the Supernatural Saturday's on BBC America. Side note, there was a decent amount of nudity in this episode which I thought was great because I think Tatiana Maslany is sexy. Some may think this was unnecessary but I think it was meant to show how Sarah uses her sexuality to her advantage, and how quick she can think on her toes. So this show is not super kid friendly, but I think adults will enjoy this sexy, smart thriller. Can't wait to see where the next 9 episodes take this show.

""Instinct"" written by Graeme Manson and directed by John Fawcett has our main character Sarah on the run from an assassin who killed the German at the end of last weeks episode ""Natural Selection"". Sarah buries the body, gets a call from another identical who tells her to go to the Germans hotel room and retrieve her briefcase. Meanwhile Sarah continues her con as Beth, (the dead identical who's identity Sarah has taken over) and has realized that Beth's police partner Art, has taken the $75,000 that Sarah emptied from Beth's bank account (kind of confusing I know). After using info taken from the German's briefcase, Sarah tracks down another identical, Alison, who happens to be a soccer mom. They set up a rendezvous for a later time, Sarah brings Felix as her back up and more secrets and questions are answered and at the same time more questions are posed. This show is still very intriguing and I am very curious what direction this show is going to go, because at this point it could go in a lot of different directions.

""Variation Under Nature"" written by Graeme Manson and directed by David Frazee (Continuum, Flashpoint) starts with Sarah face to face with Alison and Cosima, who waste no time breaking the news that they are all clones and being killed off. Cosima will give Sarah more details when Sarah gives her the Germans brief case. Meanwhile Sarah still has to play at being Beth so Art will give her the money he took from her that she emptied from Beth's account. Sarah finds herself reinstated as an on duty officer after passing the hearing from an accidental shooting. Soon Sarah is answering a call with Art and finds herself at the exact site she buried the assassinated German, not realizing it was an active quarry site. The body is chewed up but prints have been found, and Cosima maybe her only help to get her out of this tight spot. Sarah gives Cosima the case and Cosima tells Sarah she has to keep pretending to be Beth so that they can use police intel to stay safe and dig for clues. While at the police station, a mysterious caller (the killer targeting the clones) gives Art some vague info about his activities. Sarah deletes some incriminating pictures off of the Evidence Tech's computer. Afterward she meets with Mrs. S. to set up a visit with her daughter Kira. Meanwhile Art pieces together more of the Germans murder while at the murder scene. Felix gets some great and comedic screen time in this episode. We find out that the $75,000 that Sarah took from Beth's bank account didn't exactly belong to her, which makes it even more imperative that Sarah gets it back from Art. Sarah and Art get a lead on a stolen motorcycle that may be a match to tire tracks at the scene of the Germans murder, this lands Sarah and Art in the line of fire. Like the first episode, this episode ends with some intense action. This show is shaping up nicely and answering enough questions to keep it interesting and leaving enough unanswered to keep it intriguing. We find out who the killer is in this episode, and it's heavy man. Can't wait to see what happens in next weeks episode ""Effects of External Conditions"".

""Effects of External Conditions"" written by Karen Walton (Ginger Snaps, Flashpoint) and directed by Grant Harvey (Gone, Heartland) starts with the killer cleaning the wound Sarah inflicted on her. A young boy walks in on her and she grabs his hand and walks him into the bathroom where she is cleaning up and closes the door behind them, presumably to kill him. Meanwhile Sarah and Alison talk about the events that just happened. Sarah gives Alison her $75,000 back and tells her about her plan to run off with it but gives it back because she too has a family. After a text from Art, Sarah meets him at a crime scene where the Killer ditched her bike. Luckily the little boy was not murdered. When they ask the boy what the Killer looked like, he points to Sarah/Beth. The Killer left a clue in the form of a cootie catcher. Sarah struggles again to get along with Mrs. S. who threatens to not let Sarah see her daughter Kira if she misses their meeting. Back at the police station they reveal that the body found at the quarry was killed by gunshot. Sarah/Beth gets a phone call from the Killer who wants to meet. The Killer knows she is not Beth and threatens to expose Sarah's lie if she doesn't meet with her. The Killer infiltrates the police station and learns how close they are to catching her. Sarah, Art and other officers search a place they believe the Killer maybe. Sarah realizes she won't be able to make the meeting with Mrs. S so she asks Felix to get Alison to pretend to be her and meet with Mrs. S. and Kira. When Sarah and Art get back to the station, they realize the Killer has been there. The scenes between Felix and Alison are great, extremely funny. Tatiana Maslany's ability to play multiple characters gets better and better each episode. Paul shows up after the Killer called him and pretended to be Sarah. The killer calls Sarah again at the station, who still wants to meet. Sarah finds a video on her computer that the Killer made, confessing to the murder of Maggie Chen that Beth ""accidentally"" killed. Alison and Felix arrive at Mrs. S.'s, meanwhile Art and Angela seem to question Sarah's story about the Killer. Kira knows that Alison is not he mother Sarah, while Sarah follows the trail to meet with the Killer. Unlike my review which seems to be all over the place, the show isn't. The first episode was a bit confusing but as the show progresses and questions are answered, this show has great pacing. It's tense and intriguing. I cannot wait for next weeks episode ""Conditions of Existence"".

""Conditions Of Existence"" written by Alex Levine (Flashpoint, Stargate SG-1) and directed by T.J. Scott (Spartacus: War of The Damned, and the forthcoming Black Sails on STARZ which looks awesome) focuses on Sarah, Alison and Cosima realizing that they are being watched as some part of ongoing experiment. Sarah suspects Paul is watching her, Alison suspects her husband has been assigned to watch her, and Cosima is unsure of who is looking after her. Sarah thanks Alison for filling in as her so she can now pick her daughter Kira up from school and take her home to Mrs. S's. As Sarah probes further into what Paul does for a living, she triggers him to start putting together the pieces of his own puzzle because of her strange behavior. Alison finds a case in the garage that her husband rips from her hands to keep her from opening. Things are getting tense for these two couples as secrets are starting to bubble to the service. Cosima seems to have met a new friend in the lab, or has she? After Sarah visits Paul's work to bug it, her and Felix listen in on what is being said, here some big news is revealed. This leads to a phone call to Sarah where Paul plays a move to convince her to meet him, this is where things get really tense. Meanwhile Vic spots Alison at a shopping center after getting the hurt put on him by some local drug thugs. Thinking Alison is Sarah, he confronts her and demands to know what she did with the cocaine she stole from him and tells her the thugs will kill him if he cannot furnish the $15,000 he now owes them.  He is promptly pepper sprayed and tased which is hilarious. A lot of big stuff happens this episode, some major plot points are revealed, there are some good laughs and sentimental moments as well. And excellently balanced episode and well-crafted all around. Next week's episode ""Variations Under Domestication"" looks insane, and looks as if a lot of big stuff is going to go down.",1365033600,6,9825,4.617276887871854

5677817,5,B00BVMXBDO,"First episode is the set up with a lot of questions and no real answers. I'm interested to see which way this is going to go. The cast is strong at this point and as with most new shows, will have to shake down into regulars. This is not the sort of premise that would normally interest me but I wanted to catch this at the start point in hopes it would offer more than one season. I wanted something as watchable as, ""Elementary"" and this just might do the trick. I'm in.
Update; Season 1 is complete and the show is getting some strong critical reviews. I seemed to have chosen a good, solid show that holds the promise of a lot of seasons to come. Check this one out.",1364688000,2,670,4.122137404580153

5677819,4,B00BVMXBDO,"I just finished the last season and it was very entertaining watching Tatiana play all of the clone sisters though some were much better than others you're never seeing one long enough thats its a problem. The plot is about clones, competing forces, issues and the ever present family and/or domestic crisis. A very good supporting cast keeps it together and if theres a fault it would be the humor is not always present but when it is its a real boost to the show. The last season seemed rushed, over the top and pretty devoid of humor. Its a good sci-fi thriller and through the course of the show it was sometimes hard to tell the same person was playing all the roles because the transformations were so good. Overall, it was a 4-star series but the last one is a real push to give it 3-stars. There are a few characters that I found to be annoying and there was much too much of them toward the end. If nothing else, it was worth it just for the uniqueness of the plot and how well it was done by Tatiana. It took us four years to see the entire series so Im copping out with the same review for each because my mind is too blurry to address each one specifically and if you like the first one you will watch the others despite what anyone has to say about it.",1527465600,,1265,4.209876543209877

5677827,5,B00BVMXBDO,"An absolutely amazing show that I discovered by accident- and I am so thankful I did. Incredibly well-written (despite a few lingering details I felt were overlooked at series close). It was good enough for me to take the time to rate, and I do not think I ever done that before. I truly fell in love with each sestra and wish it would go on and on and on and on. It was creative, thought-provoking, well made, etc.  The sound, costumes, makeup, character development- all were crazy good. Ugh- I am just lost without my girls!

5677828,5,B00BVMXBDO,"Many state that this is science fiction because they believe that it is not possible at this time.  But I will tell you the only reason it is science fiction is because no one has done this yet, that we know of.  The technology to do all of this already exist and is done on an industrial scale for cows, pigs and sheep.  Basically clone some thing by put the embryo into a surrogate, In vitro fertilisation (IVF),  just not having been done with humans.  Now the other part of this show that was the absolute hook for me, Tatiana Maslany, she does several characters often on screen together and you have a very hard time remembering that they are all the same actor.  With a supporting cast who react to each character as a different person and you have truest Hollywood magic you could ever ask for.  If you are intolerant of any other lifestyle, no it is not for you, but if you like seeing the diversity of life and the power of being there for another person because you see a part of yourself in them, this is the greatest thing you will ever see.

5677841,4,B00BVMXBDO,"Season 1 - 5 stars
Every episode is like a season finale rollercoaster. At the end of each episode of the first season I kept saying, how are they going to keep this going? And every episode continues in absolute perfection of suspense and intrigue. Tatiana Maslany is impossibly authentic throughout every sequence, every word, every look and every blink. This is a show that deserves as much attention for its story, writing, acting and directing which is incredibly rare. Nothing is in your face or over the top. The directors give you just enough without forcing.

Season 2 - 4 stars
In this season you are more intimately introduced to the backstory where a mix of science-cult stuff mixes with a slower paced season of character development. The advancing of a new desperate story-arc or cliffhanging episode enders sort of dry up. There's plenty of intrigue and interest while each actor better demonstrates their range. In this season you will begin to discover some of the conveniences the writing direction takes to solves hard problems. It helps move the story along and gives us greater access to what the series' overall plot is - something which isn't so obvious from season 1.

Season 3 - 3 stars (maybe 2.5)
This is least admirable of the four seasons I have watched. The fatigue of the actors coupled with a lot of redundancies from previous episodes makes this season a bit average or below. There is a significant new story arc which never really seems to get off the ground. There are some very interesting moments with enough action to keep it going, but the dialog is a bit weak throughout, in my opinion. Some plot holes and some unresolved character stories make some of this season blah.

Season 4 - 3.5 stars
More convenient story writing helps solve problems and you get the feeling that some of the same ground is being covered again. By the end of the season, a much greater picture of what this whole show is about starts to emerge. A bit more of science philosophy mixes with story achievements and disappointments, leading to a couple of showdowns that are fun to watch unfold.

Season 5
I'm hoping this season will not lean on the crutches it used in previous seasons and tie it all together in a thorough way for a good ""a-ha"" moment at the end.

Conclusion
The show drags in the middle, but the mesmerizing acting of Tatiana Maslany still enchants throughout. I don't think this will turn out to be a groundbreaking, defining sci-fi show but it is entertaining. For all the punches other reviewers have given about BBC America shows vs BBC shows, I only say shut it. The BBC has produced some great content but these reviewers seem to take a for granted view of American produced film and TV. Other than the BBC, what other company produces any notable content out of England? American companies produce a ridiculous amount of quality shows that BBC and others ride the coattails of, so whatever the stigma those reviews espouse, I like to imagine an angry little British person without a wedge of lemon for their afternoon tea. I give 4 stars to drive up the average.",1513296000,3,3103,4.6862385321100914

Still the first few seasons should be part of anyone's science fiction collections.

5677847,5,B00BVMXBDO,"This is an amazing series with an original storyline and excellent acting.

To counteract some of the haters:

1. Yes, it is SciFi. You need to watch more than the first 15 minutes to understand the concept. It is not a slap you in the face space movie nor is it a cop show.
2. It is very original, and if you didn't see that it is because you didn't watch enough to get to the guts of the storyline.
3. It is a BBC show so yes, most of the actors have British accents. I watch a lot of BBC and I can't say they often if ever produce shows where the characters are American.
4. The show is rated TV-MA as in Mature Audience. That rating should tell you there will be some violence, profanity, and/or sex. If that is a problem for you, don't blame the show - the rating should have told you to expect it.
5. Re: the comments about it being anti-Christian. If you are intolerant of other lifestyles, you aren't Christian! What the show is - is intolerant of a cult. You had to watch pretty far in to get to that point in the storyline. So basically if you have a very narrow, judgemental view of how others should live their lives, maybe this isn't the show for you.
6. It isn't implausible - it is SCIENCE FICTION.
7. It is a BBC show, NOT original Amazon programming. You get whatever seasons for free that are marked that way. Just because one season is free doesn't mean they all are. That is the case with all Amazon Prime viewing. Again, don't blame the show, look to see if it is Prime before ordering.
8. Personal hot button - don't give a show a poor rating because you have a problem with streaming. You are rating the show. If you didn't actually order/watch the show and you get an email to review it, IGNORE IT don't give a show you never bothered to watch a bad rating! Again, you are rating the SHOW.

As another reviewer provided, my taste which might help you determine if you will enjoy the series:
Star Trek
Stargate SG1
Grimm
Westworld
Dr. Who (David Tennant et al)
Torchwood
Firefly
(Also Downton Abbey, Ice Age, and a wide variety of other styles of shows and movies...)

This is obviously the kind of show for people who insist that everyone has to have some kind of baggage or trauma in their life, who like their characters to be gross stereotypes, and are sufficiently ignorant about how the world actually works that they can manage to suspend their disbelief while watching something so unreasonable.  Yes, I know it's sci-fi.  I'm a huge fan of sci-fi...  just quality stuff like Star Trek TNG, Stranger Things, Westworld, Sense8, Futurama, Rick and Morty, etc.  It's obvious from the first episode that this show just isn't going to make that list.

I expected from description and trailers for this to be fairly gritty and noir. I did not find that to be the case. You see where a plot line could lead and then the punch is pulled. Noir requires some subtlety which I find missing.

I made it through episode 1 and just could not continue on when faced with all of the unrealistic situations. I understand that in fiction and SF one needs to suspend belief to a certain extent but still even the first episode had bank and police scenes that were totally impossible in the real world While the protagonist is one of a number of clones those she interacts with are supposed to be actual people doing their jobs and any bank manager or police official would not behave in the way portrayed in the first episode.",1505174400,2,928,4.421052631578948

5677863,1,B00BVMXBDO,"I recently began watching Orphan Black a week ago, completing season 1 and a few episodes into season 2. Initially I was intrigued with the plot: clones unbeknownst to one another discover each other haphazardly. The mystery of their birth and relationship to one another continued to deepen and play itself out. I respected Tatiana Maslany's interpretive performance of each clone, soon forgetting one actress was portraying 4-5 different characters. However, after the first season, I steadily became tired of the repeated murders, joyous drug use, gay male caricatures, and other stereotypic ways to personify. Well done characterization is not so shallow. And then consider the reasoning for the murders - fundamental Christianity and purity of belief as hope for the future, parent abandonment, extreme mental and emotional instability, or the science of cloning as a salvation for humanity. I never did get the last one. Add in gunfire, chaotic sex, and gory murders - pretty simplistic. Outside of Sarah's relationship with her child, other relationships seemed superficial. This show reminded me of other TV series that started off strong, but quickly fizzled out. I kept imagining the actors sitting around a kitchen table, making jokes and laughing as the show steadily became predictable and repetitive. Yet it gave exposure and a paycheck. And I'm glad Tatiana won her accolades.",1504224000,,1391,5.327272727272727
5677864,1,B00BVMXBDO,"I tried watching this drama, because it is so highly rated here. However I ended up dropping this after the first few eps, because I couldn't take more. First off, all the characters in this drama are not likable. Flawed characters are fine as long as they can make the viewer care, but the characters here (especially the main female lead) failed to make me care, so by extension I didn't care about what might happen to her (and therefore the suspense took a big hit, because I'm not there holding my breath with the main character/characters or rooting for her/them). Basically this isn't a show that left me with any type of good feeling. Dark is fine, as long as I feel that there is light too and that light will prevail. However this show and its characters just felt dreary, sleazy, and soulless (even the R-rated scenes - which I didn't expect - were so dry and lacking in any emotion or sensuality, but I'm supposed to believe that the heroine is suddenly attracted to her dead clone's husband).

So in conclusion, this show is just not for me.",1503878400,3,1054,4.518324607329843

5677866,5,B00BVMXBDO,"I'm so in love with this show and with each of Tatiana's characters. She does such an incredible job being Sarah/Cos/Rachel/Helena/Alison/Beth/etc. That I have to frequently remind myself that they are not, in fact, real... AND they are not even played by different actresses. These frequent realizations are sometimes coupled with a brief feeling of grief or disappointment. The way she acts out these different roles is so spectacular that I want to see them over and over.

In addition to that, I am equally in love with the other characters as well. For example, Felix is a brilliant character, full of rebellion, vulnerability, and wisdom. He's funny, powerful and heartbreaking all at once. I love him, Donny, Paul, Mrs. S, Keira, Art, everyone!

The Studios need to come clean about what they're doing. It shouldnt be my responsibility to inform the public that the shows they enjoy are not footage of human actors but a Game Platform of easily manipulated low-cost Cartoon Characters. This software is used to Animate the News, Ads & is now the primary source of Screen Personalities.

5677881,5,B00BVMXBDO,"Orphan Black is an addictive show.  I first started watching because the cover just looked intriguing.  However; what I found was completely madness and of course I was hooked I could not stopped watching once I started.

Season one follows the story of an orphan named Sarah.  She returned to the city to pay a debt; she wanted to make a clean life and retake her child back.  Sarah did not anticipate what was coming. The night she returns her life changes dramatically when she found a stranger that looked just like her.  After Sarah witnessed this woman's suicide, she assumes her identity because well she thought this is perfect take her money clear her life and move on.  A small simple thing that instead of becoming her solution it now became her life.

Sarah finds herself stuck looking for answers. Nothing is what it seems; she found clones that looked like her and everyone connected them to her and the girl who killed herself.  In the meantime there is someone trying to kill her and she is now on the lookout for her life and to get answers to this mystery.

I found myself unable to stop watching, each episode gets better and better and without sleep I continued to the next season.  Lovers who enjoy shows with lots of action, suspense, and are looking for something completely different will find themselves enjoying this show so much.

That was all I could come up with for the second star. I gave it three episodes to give me something to care about but it failed. The main actress plays the first episode as one of the most detestable leads in a show I've seen. If she had cared about the death of the first woman I could see some of her choices being ok, but she didn't care. The main character watches a person commit suicide then proceeds to rob that dead person's bank account, moves into her house and sleeps with the dead woman's husband.

After a random beginning, the series began to focus. Extensive flash backs and teasers are an annoyance suggesting a limited budget, but they become more tolerable by the end of season one. Simultaneously, however, the focus dissipates, foretelling no plot and no ending. Lively prospects are raised, only to be dropped as the series chases the ""in"" topic of the day.

I watched longer than I might have, in part seeking justification for introducing nonsense about secret patents, as well as ones conferring ownership of synthetic humans and their offspring. But patents, too, were a fleeting ""hot"" topic of no enduring consequence. Interest dwindled as watching became increasingly an exercise in goose chasing.

Yes this is a story about clones but it's a breakdown of how society, economic status, and culture can alter a person.

5678039,3,B00BVMXBDO,"My hubby and I are hooked on this series.  Tatiana Maslany does an extraordinary job and the story line holds our interest.  Being a child of the '60s...I am certainly not a prude.  However, I just do not understand the younger generations need to watch other people having sex ALL of the time--regardless of sexual orientation.  Is it because they are not ""getting any"" in their own personal lives?  Seems kind of sad, really, and the reason it gets only 3 stars. At times, it is as ""romantic"" and titillating as watching 2 dogs in the front yard. Doesn't anyone make plain old porn movies anymore for the lonely, inexperienced youth to watch?  Why ruin perfectly good stories with watching other people have sex?  Good grief, they certainly are not doing anything we have not experienced first hand (and, possibly, better) and it gets sooo redundantly boring after a while...detracting from a really decent plot and really decent acting by Tatiana Maslany (et al).",1485388800,2,966,4.853658536585366

5678363,5,B00BVMXBDO,"I first discovered the series when I saw Tatiana Maslany win an Emmy or Golden Globe. I had never heard of her. The series is full of intrigue and many great actors.

I highly recommend this series!",1482278400,,319,4.333333333333333
5678364,4,B00BVMXBDO,"Tatiana is a phenomenal actress. The way she's able to make each of her characters distinctively different is amazing. Even when she's being one character pretending to be another she nails it. The first season is full of twists, turns and intrigue. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Only reason I gave it four stars as opposed to five is because there are a few moments in the season that just don't ring true. Not enough to diminish it's greatness, but enough to make it a little less than perfect. In reality if they allowed it I'd give it 4.5 stars",1482192000,,557,4.470588235294118
5678365,2,B00BVMXBDO,"Not seeing what the fans see in this one. Episode 1 proves, if nothing else, that Canadian actors are as horrible at doing British accents as American actors. Not seeing what makes the star so great and amazing and gorgeous, etc. She's okay (when not doing the terrible fake Cockney). Most of the rest of the cast is not. The writing is not much above a Doctor Who level -- in fact, I get the sense this show is for Doctor Who fans who want to feel a bit more grown up. As the first season piled up the preposterous plot points and story lines only an adolescent, grown up or not, could buy into, I bailed.",1482192000,4,606,4.188034188034188

5678388,4,B00BVMXBDO,"I was originally repelled from watching this because the cover art - it reminded me of Silence of the Lambs. Definitely a case of 'judged the series by the cover.' Disregard the overlapping faces - it doesn't represent this series well. What finally compelled me to watch this was learning that the main actress plays as many as 12 roles in the show, often many at the same time. It's genius for it's CGI and ""tv magic"" and it's interesting how well it works and how easily you can tell the characters by mannerisms as simple as posture. Hats off to the actress - even though she plays many of the characters, the viewer is never confused who is who.

As for the story line, it's a stretch from my usual shows but after season one, I'm interested enough to start season two and keep watching.",1482019200,,792,4.424657534246576

Non Stop Fun. Silly and deadly serious. Tatiana Maslany is the 7th (9th, 10th?) wonder of the Acting world.
the most fun is to watch one of her clones try to transform in order to impersonate another. If often ends up a delightful parody of the imitated character.",1481241600,,329,4.672413793103448

5678485,5,B00BVMXBDO,"Even after watching interviews and behind-the-scenes special effects extras showing how they make the show, I still forget that Tatiana Maslany is really one actor! The show so seemlessly and transparently uses the special effects to tell the story that you just watch and enjoy, and forget this girl is one person channeling many characters at once! My favorite times are when she layers a character on top of another character, masterful and subtle! I cannot get enough of this show, which makes sure you're having fun with it, and still delves into several current and future issues concerning the progress of both science and society.",1481241600,,638,5.028301886792453

5678492,4,B00BVMXBDO,"I found it very engaging and the lead actress does an outstanding job. What I didn't like about it is that it is the first year of a multi-year series.

5678529,5,B00BVMXBDO,"It sucks that this show isn't watched by more people. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that its not on Netflix (which has far more subscribers than Amazon Prime). It's not up there with Breaking Bad, The Wire, or Game of Thrones but damn, it is the most addictive thing since ""24"". It's never quiet for long and there are a lot of plot twists. Not to mention Tatiana Maslany's brilliance at playing 5 different main characters (and 4-5 minor ones).

5678542,5,B00BVMXBDO,"The first  season really drew me in! I could not stop watching , as each episode leaves you hanging, and dying to know what is going to happen next.  Maslany is amazingly talented - she plays multiple characters, and I kept forgetting the ""clones"" weren't different actresses.  I liked the small bits of dark humor sprinkled throughout the show too........Helena is my fave of the gals!",1480636800,,386,4.818181818181818

I would rate Fringe as 5 stars,  Eureka as 5 stars, and Lost as 5 stars. (I'm not saying these shows are related to Orphan Black) In my opinion 2-1/2 stars would be a fair rating for this show...
12/3 half way through season 3and still nothing special about this show. And ENOUGH  ALREADY with the BACKGROUND  music/sound it's so damned annoying....",1480550400,,506,4.478260869565218

5678560,5,B00BVMXBDO,"For me, a lot of TV shows are either hit or miss. Orphan Black hits immediately and keeps me thirsting for more. The only thing I don't like is the near entire season is part of ""previously on Orphan Black"" as if every episode they expect to have entirely new viewers and that can get tedious, especially if you're binge watching, watching over a very short period, or just have a very good memory for what has already happened in a show. I do wish Season 4 was on Prime but I assume when Season 5 is available online, they will make Season 4 part of the Prime benefit package. Even so, if I had the cash to spare, I'd probably be up to purchasing the season pass.",1479772800,,664,4.1953125

5678566,5,B00BVMXBDO,"First let me say that, although I am a Science Fiction & Fantasy fan, this review is written by the TV & Film Buff in me who loves great Film & Television no matter the genre & no matter the era.

Orphan Black is of the most amazing series I've ever experienced and I say that having originally written ""seen"" & right away realizing that word was wrong.  This series is an experience right out of the gate with the mind bending opening in an underground train station where we meet star Tatiana Maslany playing the first 2 of the several clone ""sisters"" she will soon discover she has.  Playing multiple characters is never easy, but playing one's that look alike except for personal styles & mannerisms & still differenciating between them is the hardest.  Maslany does this seemlessly lyrics & as you get into the series & her characters are interacting constantly it is nothing less than stunning.

None of this would work without writing of the same high caliber and these writers have deliver one of the most interesting, intriguing & thought provoking opening seasons in television history.  One of the best thriller/mystery/conpiracy/science fiction dramas, saying this standing alone or together (w/ the exception of the conpiracy genre which needs to work along side another genre to work properly).  This IS great TV!

It is Tatiana Maslany who drives this show, though, let there be no mistake.  I have never seen a performance like hers before.  She brings a whole new calibre to acting.  My admiration for her ability is boundless & I can't wait to see what else she is capable of.  SHE brings me back time & again to watch.",1479600000,,1637,4.725352112676056

5678582,4,B00BVMXBDO,"This is an interesting sci-fi series about human cloning that relies on more on acting and plot writing than any special effects.  For the most part, the acting is OK and most of the different characters are plausible and believable.  The plot line is not novel or ground-breaking, but it is generally presented in a plausible and realistic way with a few unfortunate exceptions (e.g., some incidents or scenes that are over the top and not very believable).

5678635,4,B00BVMXBDO,"For quite some time, I have seen this show advertised on BBC America, and for some reason, I have assumed that I would not like it.  Wrong!  It is not quite as thrilling for me as was the Battlestar Galactica miniseries (2003) and TV series (2004-2009), or Stranger Things, but the writing and acting in Season 1 had me looking forward to streaming an episode every night, and I had to fight the urge to binge-watch past my bedtime.  For those who are not into sci-fi that really pushes the imagination (e.g., like the monsters and multi-dimensional travel in Stranger Things), I will say that this show (so far) addresses technology (in a present-time setting) that many would probably believe could be just over the horizon.  The sci-fi premise of the show is ever-present, but the great acting of T. Maslany and others, as well as the goofy and dark humor of the sort that you may have seen in Breaking Bad, may make this show fun to watch, even for those who are not really ""into"" sci-fi.  I recommend giving it a try.  If the first couple of episodes don't grab you, then move on.",1478476800,,1085,4.510204081632653

I initially did not draw interest to the show due to its similar title to Orange is the New Black - this was a mistake. Fortunately we had friends insist that we would love it and we do! We love the Orphan Black cast of actors - talented individuals that bring life to their characters. Tatiana Maslany is well deserving of her Emmy Award and you will learn why when you watch this show. Highly, highly recommend. This show deserves all the stars in the sky, not just 5 :)",1478304000,,581,4.388888888888889

I am an identical twin. It would take two seconds for them to figure out I'm not him. And we're both IT professionals.",1478217600,,291,4.087719298245614

Even the unlikely plots became challenging when laced into developing characters' actions.  Warming characters grew to be acceptable rather than cloying, and the humor wasn't offensive.

5678698,5,B00BVMXBDO,"This series is one of those guilty pleasures you can watch when you need to get that latest appalling documentary out of your head. Tatiana Maslany is simply brilliant and the writing, while often full of holes and ungainly twists, is great fun for someone like me who loves dark humor. It has a bit of that subversive Max Headroom feel, (augmented by the occasional presence of Matt Frewer.) It is almost enough just to watch the transformations that Maslany accomplishes as she portrays each of a great number of clones with widely various upbringings or to try to imagine how the filmmakers manage to have these characters interact so seamlessly. The story is always desperate except for some sweet moments of relief. Breaking Bad meets Max Headroom while Dr. Who looks on ...",1477785600,,779,4.82089552238806

Instead the show is very heavy on  advancing negative stereotypes.  Were the situation  reversed, the howling and outrage would be deafening. The hypocrisy stares you in the face in nearly every episode.  If you are not in the market for constant affirmation, it gets old really, really l fast.  The show would also have benefited from  more likable protagonists.  In spite of the 'sestras' we're-here-for-each-other'  veneer,  the narcissistic personalities leave  little for  the viewer to  care about.

For reference, I stuck it out to the end of the first episode of the ""Black Mirror"" but won't be watching another because there was never a payoff to make up for the -- let's say ""unpleasantness"".",1528243200,,485,4.438202247191011
