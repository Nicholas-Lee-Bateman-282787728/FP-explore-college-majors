2750362,4,B000MV9O4K,I got the package because the description said the three movies were in spanish. I was surprised to find out that the Wizard of Oz has subtitles in spanish but is not translated to the language.  I am dissapointed because my little boy (who does not understand English yet)wishes to watch the movie in Spanish.... Description of the movies should be corrected.,1202169600,5,360,4.806451612903226
2750363,5,B000MV9O4K,I found this product very good. My daughter had asked for two of the dvds  included in this group but also enjoyed the the third one and did not have it on dvd so I was very happy to find all three grouped together,1200268800,,214,3.8636363636363638
2750364,5,B000MV9O4K,"This is a wonderful combination of classic films. These movies brought back soooo many memories, and to have these three in one package is an added bonus. I would highly recommend this package if you want to show your children these classic movies for the first time, or whether you want to watch them for the 1000th time yourself.",1198195200,,331,4.627118644067797
2750365,5,B000MV9O4K,"These are 3 great movies for the whole family. Spanning from the 30's to the 80's, you get some of the most exciting family movies ever made. I'm buying this set the day it is released and showing my entire family.",1176249600,2,214,4.2439024390243905
2750366,1,B000MV9O4K,"Essential Classics - Family Films?  Wizard of Oz, NO argument there.  But 'The Goonies'?  What reviewer thought that was a family classic?  It's good but there are so many other movies that are better (e.g., 'It's a Wonderful Life' - yeah I know it's a Christmas movie, maybe there should be another Essential set called Christmas Classics along with 'Miracle on 34th Street' - the original not the insipid remakes).  And 'Willy Wonka'?  It's kind of quirky classic, more of a cult film, if you ask me.  I think someone ought to go back and put together another three movies better suited to the moniker 'Classic Family Films'.",1176249600,3,627,4.75
2750377,3,B000MV9O4K,Things happen ... I understand. Had a special night for my kids planned by watching the original Wizard of Oz prior to the next night's going to see WICKED broadway show at Tampa's Performing Arts Center the next night. Unfortunately the disc had a recurring skip in the middle of it and it wouldn't function past that spot. The night would not be the same. They did refund me for the purchase without hesitation so that was good.,1360454400,,430,4.5256410256410255
2750378,5,B000MV9O4K,Excellent value for this classic 3 pack set. Transaction was excellent as well. This set is highly recommended and is a hit with my family.,1320105600,,139,4.6

2750380,1,B000MV9O4K,"I received 3 different sets of the ""Essential Classics"" movies collection as gifts.  NONE of them play without skipping sections.  I loved the concept of the set which is why I registered for them on my wish list.  Truly disappointed in the quality of the product.",1303516800,,264,4.695652173913044
2750381,4,B000MV9O4K,"The Goonies and Willy Wonka are classics for people who have kids now, the Wizard of OZ was several generations ago. They should have substituted Labyrinth or Stand By Me for WOZ, then it would be great.",1300492800,,203,4.513513513513513
2750382,5,B000MV9O4K,"I absolutely loved this deal! The movies came sealed, brand new, and in perfect condition. It looks just like the image on the website. There are 3 slim dvd cases for each movie. All great movies and classics! Would definitely recommend buying! You can't find a price like this for all 3 classic movies in one!",1281139200,2,310,4.553571428571429

2750384,1,B000MV9O4K,I just want to confirm the other 1-star rating so others don't purchase this set because of the language options. German is definitely not available for any of the movies. But a good deal for 3 great movies nonetheless.,1272153600,,219,4.641025641025641
2750385,1,B000MV9O4K,"I really hate to give this set a 1 star, but the description was wrong!  I bought this ONLY because it said it was in German (dubbed and with subtitles)!  I already own all 3 of these movies in English, and they are really great productions.  Gene Wilder is my all-time favorite actor, and I feel ashamed of myself giving ANYTHING he is in a 1star rating.  I want to be clear that the 1 star is for the error in description, not for the movies!",1256515200,11,444,4.127906976744186

2750391,4,B000MV9O4K,"This is a good price to get two classic movies - Wizard of Oz and Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I'm not sure how ""Goonies"" ended up in this collection, but the kids seem to like it and now ask to watch it. Overall a good purchase.",1237939200,,240,4.020833333333333
2750392,5,B000MV9O4K,"I have 2 little girls 1 1/2 & 3.....both are crazy over The Wizard of Oz.... but the cost of it alone on other sites was crazy. This collection was WONDERFUL! They now have 2 favorites with Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory being a close 2nd to OZ. They aren't to fond of the Goonies.... too bad the collection didn't have ET or Annie or something like that. But hey....overall.... This product is GREAT!!!! A wonderful find.
Thanks,

2750394,5,B000MV9O4K,I was looking for all 3 of these movies seperately but to my surprise I found this 3 pack with all 3 movies in one box.  These movies are next to impossible to find on DVD in the stores.,1229126400,,186,3.769230769230769
2750395,5,B000MV9O4K,"I bought two of these for my four grandchildren ( two to each family).
The children range in age from five to two and a half.  My husband and
I put it on for them for the first time, and they were all mesmerized.
Since then, they must have watched it 10 times, and love to talk about all
the characters.  Even the youngest can name all the characters and the bad witch.  Their parents (my children) were rejoicing in the fact that this was one movie from their childhood that has withstood time with its magic and appeal.

2750397,5,B000MV9O4K,"My granddaughter turned three years old Sept 1st and we gave her the Wizard of Oz movie. She loves it. Her mother had recorded it off of the T.V. including all the commercials and some how it was misplaced. We searched and searched the video stores for this movie when I decided to look online. You guys are awesome. Now my sweet granddaughter can watch her most favoritest movie in the whole world.
Thanks again!!
