I would have never known knowing the background of the artist's century would have made a difference. The math involved in making this piece of art is amazing. The video makers went very in-depth farther than I would have ever known to go, this is probably because I am not an expert on painted works. One thing I noticed about the video is that they addressed the issue of irony; the supposed Michelangelo face on the half-horse half-man, I thought it was astounding that it seems every artist that I've seen works of does this to some extent.
The way the video was created was of great value I really understood what they were trying to convey. The one thing I could barely stand was the tone of the speaker's voice, although he was saying things I totally understood, he said it in such a manner that to me, it felt as if he did not want to be talking about the subject. It made the video sound like the speaker was forced to say what he said. I don't usually notice this, but his voice distracted me from actually listening to what he had to say at certain times. Also another drawback was that if you had no frame of reference to know the times he was speaking of you might get lost very quickly. All in all a great video, I could have just liked it better with another ""voice actor.""",1075334400,3,1385,4.3307692307692305
