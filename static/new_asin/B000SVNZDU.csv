8206994,3,B000SVNZDU,"Film producers are people too, and therefore we expect them to have some ability for self-reflection.  Many times while making a bad movie, the creators will realize that no one will able to take their production seriously and they try to use that to their advantage. They may make the special effects even sillier; they can encourage hammy performances.

Still, other producers will suffer a mental block and -- convinced that their film has much to say -- they turn a mere bad movie into a horrible experience by infusing their film with pretentiousness and an attempted gravity that the poor script simply cannot support.

I suspect that the folks who unleashed DOUBLECROSS ON COSTA'S ISLAND to the direct-to-video audience were a mixture of both. In places, the screenplay revels in its illogic. In others, it takes itself with extreme seriousness. It actually makes for a jarring viewing experience as the tone shifts almost uncomfortably from scene to scene.

The story of DOUBLECROSS begins with a man named Franco Columbu. He is the movie's star, as well as its producer and director; he also co-wrote the screenplay.  His previous experience for these duties included having a refrigerator tied to his back while competing in the World's Strongest Man competition. According to his IMDB profile, he is in the Guinness Book of World Records for his ability to inflate and burst a hot water bottle using only his lungs. Stanley Kubrick could only dream about such skills.

Columbu plays a cop named Costa who retires to become a sculptor in Sardinia. While enjoying his second career, he becomes involved in a botched kidnapping attempt of a United States Senator. It's actually difficult to mess up a kidnapping to the extent that you end up with the wrong victim. It's easier however if your plan involves tying a rope from a speedboat to a deckchair and the deckchair to a parachute. You end up kidnapping whoever happens to blunder in the path of the deckchair (in this case, the Senator's leggy mistress).

Costa is hired by an unexplained American woman ostensibly as a tour guide, but he quickly aids her in her attempts to located the kidnapped woman. Who this woman is, why she's interested in the kidnapping, and the source of her large amounts of money is never addressed. In some movies, this would be dealt with by having winks and nods and suggestions that she works for some mysterious agency or group. Here, it appears more likely that the scriptwriters simply forgot. After they first meet, her background is never discussed.

Soon we enter the meat of the film, which mostly revolves around Costa running through the scenery of Sardinia, shooting things and hanging off of vehicles. His main adversaries are a group of local thugs headed by Frank Stallone. Audiences will remember Frank Stallone mostly for being the Stallone brother who wasn't considered talented enough for the starring role in STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT.

Costa possesses three superhuman abilities. The first is that it apparently impossible to shoot him. I lost count of the number of times that an unhurried sniper carefully aimed his weapon at the unsuspecting Costa, pulled the trigger, and then watched his bullet safely sail past the intended victim.

His second great skill is the amazing knack he has of producing weapons out of air whenever he finds himself in a gunfight. For example, while being chased by armed gangsters, he ducks into an abandoned shack. When they fire a grenade into the structure, he escapes the blast by jumping up a chimney. When he emerges, he does so while now carrying a fully loaded automatic weapon. You may think that this is just a bit of artistic license. Perhaps the implication is that he already knew this house and knew where weapons were hidden. However, on no less than three occasions, while running through the countryside, he stops to reach under a random bush and produces yet another fully loaded weapon. It's honest baffling. It isn't played as a joke either; he neither literally nor figuratively gives a knowing wink to the audience. The implication is that it's perfectly normal to expect to see Sardinia's scenery liberally littered with large assortments of heavy weaponry.

His third skill is his ability to choose stunningly incompetent adversaries. His life is spared in one sequence, because his opponent - with absolutely no provocation - drives his own vehicle off a cliff. Another thug is killed by Costas hijacking a slow moving heavy-duty construction digger and smashing his enemy's car. Luckily his adversary is content to only shout at Costas and not take normal precautions such as driving his car the five mph it would take to escape.

DOUBLECROSS is a film that delivers more WTFs per minute than any film I've seen in months. One of the most bizarrely strange scenes occurs in what is apparently supposed to be a character developing moment. Forced to spend the night in the mountains, daybreak greets Costa and his lady friend. Costa decides to playfully awaken Veronica by squirting her with goat's milk, obtained directly from the source. We don't see it quite like this at first. The scene is presented initially as a close-up of Veronica's face with a white liquid being shot into her mouth while she shrieks and shouts. We jump straight to an other close-up, this of Costa gleefully manipulating a goat udder.

The rapid jump cut editing also contributes to the film's surreal nature. One moment he pays two children for their scooter. In the next immediate scene, he's shown running through the desert on foot being chased by two thugs with no scooter to be seen. The next time we see him, he's somehow arrived at his brother's house in town and is asking to borrow the car. I kept asking myself if perhaps this DVD was a severely edited version of the film. Is it possible that I accidentally set my player to show the DVD chapters in random order?

The insanity keeps increasing and topping itself. So by the time you reach the end and find that the double-cross of the title is totally implausible, you aren't expecting it to make sense anyway. People randomly changing loyalties and motivations, utterly defying the storyline from the beginning of the film seems much more banal after you've already sat through a scene where Costa is shot by an AK47, bursts into flames and jumps in a pond to heal.

This movie is probably best experienced as a goldfish. If your short-term memory extends for about thirty seconds, you'll be in good shape. If you can recall something you saw five minutes ago, then you might notice a some inconsistencies. If you can actually remember the beginning of the film while simultaneously watching the end, then you'll have the misfortune of noticing that the whole thing really doesn't totally fit together. But while it is certainly bad, it is a highly entertaining form of bad and it can at least be enjoyed on that level.",1317600000,6,6935,4.855329949238579
