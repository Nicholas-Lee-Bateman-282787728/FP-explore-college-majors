8118845,1,B000F8F6Q0,"Since I love Celtic music, I am attempting to learn the Bodhran. I found this tape to be next to useless.  It is a good introduction, but has little useful information.  If you are an absolute beginner like me, you will find Tommy Hayes ""Bodhran Bones and Spoons"", as well as  Mel Mercier ""Bodhran & Bones"" very helpful.  They are both excellent, but I might give Mel Mercier an extra point for being a little more technical.",1357603200,,425,4.48051948051948
