Why in the name of all that is holy, have they not distributed this in English with French subtitles, or in French dubbed in English or in French with English sub-titles??? (my preference). Please do it. It is a supremely different, haunting, mesmerizing love story between two very lonely people. The musical score is a character itself in its perfection. The cinematography is so very good. The casting is genius. I own it in the French DVD version. I would love to know what is said in the barber shop. Please do this for yourselves; this film should be shared in every language. (Note: I searched on the Amazon.com in France and found it in French, fair price, and it plays on my USA Costco-bought DVD player.)",1472947200,,727,4.6875
