8450282,4,B004ZMC7JG,"I was hoping this DVD would be a little more fast paced, but in the end it all works itself out because you do get a really good work-out that you feel while your doing it and after you are done. I would recommend this, its worth having!",1336262400,,237,3.9583333333333335
8450283,5,B004ZMC7JG,"I have several exercise, yoga, kettle bell and Bosu ball DVDs which I all use regularly on a rotating basis so that I don't get bored. I work out 5-6 times a week. Of all the DVDs I own, this one was the least expensive, requires the least amount of equipment (a balance ball and/or a small dumbbell can be used but the routine can be done without as well) but gives the most concentrated core workout. I didn't appreciate exactly how much I would benefit from this workout. I highly recommend it.",1336003200,,497,4.354838709677419
