8309980,4,B001HY3B2W,"UFC 90 is a great venue, as long as you don't include the main event. Not that the main event was terrible, but sudden injuries always seem to ruin everything.",1309392000,,159,4.333333333333333
8309981,5,B001HY3B2W,"I'll just warn you guys up front: only four fights end early. However, that doesn't mean this DVD doesn't deserve a lot of consideration. The decision fights are all quite good, with the Clementi/Maynard fight being the sole exception. Otherwise, there were two blowout decisions, but the rest were extremely evenly matched. The card also features three of my all-time favorite fighters: Tyson Griffin, Junior dos Santos, and the GOAT, Anderson Silva. Them alone warrants a purchase. The fight card is:
Josh Burkman/Pete Sell-5/5
Hermes Franca/Marcus Aurelio-4/5
Dan Miller/Matt Horwich-5/5
Spencer Fisher/Shannon Gugerty-5/5
Thales Leites/Drew McFedries-4/5
Sean Sherk/Tyson Griffin-5/5
Fabricio Werdum/Junior dos Santos-5/5
Rich Clementi/Gray Maynard-3/5
Thiago Alves/Josh Koscheck-4.5/5
Anderson Silva/Patrick Cote-4/5

I will say this: the loser of the title fight at the end of the card deserved an immediate rematch after he healed.",1281744000,,938,5.948148148148148
8309982,5,B001HY3B2W,"This was one I was looking forward to. Main Event and Co-Main Event delivered a promise that this would be a night to remember. And it was! But that doesn't mean it was memorable entirely in a great way.

The Main Event featured a striker fan's dream match-up, or so it appeared. Anderson Silva, striker of all strikers, the best of the best, was to have his work cut out for him. That was because he was taking on Patrick Cote, a man who's never been knocked out, only submitted twice. And despite a split decision over Ricardo Almeida, Cote earned a shot against the man, Anderson Silva!

The Co-Main event looked amazing as well. In the beginning, Diego Sanchez was set to go up against Thiago Alves, but injury said otherwise, prompting Diego to move down to Lightweight, like he'd been thinking about anyway. So to take the place of Diego Sanchez was Josh Koscheck. Koscheck's record speaks for itself. A man who was merely a wrestler in the original Ultimate Fighter has turned himself into one of the most well rounded match-ups in MMA. Could Koscheck take the stand-up of Alves?

There were a total of 10 fights on this line-up. They are listed below

Josh Burkman vs. Pete Sell: Burkman used to be a beast! Sell always comes to scrap. A good bout that goes to a unanimous decision.

Hermes Franca vs. Marcus Aurelio: Teacher vs. student, and they don't like each other! Unanimous decision.

Dan Miller vs. Matt Horwich: This is one great fight that all submission fans will enjoy time and time again! Unanimous decision.

Spencer Fisher vs. Shannon Gugerty: Well, Gugerty won his first fight in the UFC. Is he good enough to play KING of the octagon? Great fight that ends with a submission in the 3rd.

Thales Laites vs. Drew McFedries: Hmm...Drew wants to slug it out, Laites knows better, and in ends within a minute and a half!

Sean Sherk vs. Tyson Griffin: Two wrestlers that LOVE to throw the hands! This went to a unanimous decision, and it wasn't fight of the night for nothing!!!

Fabricio Werdum vs. Junior dos Santos: All I can say is WOW!! Check out this first round knock out!

Rich Clementi vs. Gray Maynard: Hey, Clementi will fight anybody, but will Gray Maynard BULLY him around like he has his other opponents? A unanimous decision answers that question real quick!

Thiago Alves vs. Josh Koscheck: Both fighters show they deserve to be there, but one of them earns a title shot for UFC 100! Unanimous decision...this is a great fight!

Anderson Silva vs. Patrick Cote: This, unfortunately, is where a lot of fans said YUCK! Silva defended his title all right, but he didn't fight like he was fighting Rich Franklin or Dan Henderson. The ending sucked, and fans expected better. I hope Anderson Silva returns to greatness and stays the champion that UFC fans love.

The DVD is great, the countdown is awesome, and like I said, MOST of the fights are worth it as well.",1249603200,6,2895,4.62890625
8309983,5,B001HY3B2W,I love the UFC.  Always fun to watch.  It's hard not to watch it in one sitting.,1242000000,,80,3.6470588235294117
8309984,4,B001HY3B2W,"SPOILERS
No disrespect to Patrick Cote, I think he does stand a chance against Silva and could possibly beat him, but Silva seems to be bored with his reign.  This is because he is head and shoulders above most other MWs.  It is almost time for him to consider taking a few fights at LHW to see how he fairs there.  Koscheck and Alves engage in an epic WW war that is pretty much a battle for a title shot.  Maynard, while possessing many skills, always seems to play his fights safe and goes for the decision win, not really trying to finish.  There is a shocking upset on this card and a few other great battles.",1237248000,2,614,4.213675213675214
8309985,5,B001HY3B2W,"Anderson ""The Spider"" Silva returns to fight Patrick ""The Predator"" Cote in a Middleweight championship fight. Silva is on a 7 fight win streak going into this fight and Cote is on a 4 fight win streak. This was the most disappointing fight of the night because of how it ended. I won't hide anything in this review. Silva and Cote battle it out for 2 rounds in which ends up being Silva's longest fight in the Octagon. In the opening minute of the 3rd round, Cote injures his leg and Silva wins via tko (injury). Not only was the ending disappointing, but Silva's performance was also. For the most part, he just danced around for 2 rounds and showed off. I came to see a fight, not a dance.

There were 2 really great fights before this though. Alves fights late replacement for Diego Sanchez, Josh Koscheck. Alves was coming off 2 huge knockout wins over Parisyan and Hughes and was considered #1 contender for the belt after Fitch. The fight was a great 3 round battle that had me on the edge of my seat. The second good fight was Sean Sherk vs Tyson Griffin. Sherk was coming off the loss to BJ Penn but nothing held him back from earning Fight of the Night honors and fight of the year award for this fight. Tyson Griffin also looked impressive in this fight and delivers all he's got for 3 grueling rounds.

This event is also worth purchasing to see a huge upset with Werdum vs Black House student Junior Dos Santos. This was a brutal knockout that no one saw coming. Almost as surprising as Evans vs Liddell.

The Gray Maynard vs Rich Clementi fight was a dud and I kind of expected it to be.
