456311,5,6302336678,"Throughout our illustrious history of watching B films we have come across so many memorable films, with a fair amount of flops sprinkled in. Every now and then we'll come across something nearly life changing. Well today we have witnessed a film so incredibly B that it may find itself in our top 10 all-time favorites. Now we know you're saying ""But that's right up there with Death Ring & Money to Burn, how can it be?"" We realize top-10 boasts a high level of greatness, but rest assured that Double Trouble is worthy of this placement. This film lends itself to a newly discovered genre known as Meatbag B. This finding is the equivalent of a world renowned scientist discovering a new species of life. In this genre you'll get to watch bulky gym rats, who can barely reach down to tie their shoes, attempt to act in a full length feature. It's really something special. They must have had to cut 30 times a scene while the Paul's brothers clumsily butchered their poorly written lines. Folks it honestly doesn't get much better then this. A little action, a little comedy, and two of the most sublime mullets to ever grace the silver screen.

Double trouble opens up with bad brother Peter as he hoists some diamonds from a safe. With a heavy lack of protein isolate affecting his brain he calls the cops to report his own heist. Naturally the only cop to show up his equally bulky twin brother David along with his partner...Sherane from House Party! We're already up to 3 stars within the first 5 minutes. Peter slow-wittedly escapes and brother David goes home to burn off his frustrations. And how does he do this? By benching in his apartment for the most awkward 3 minute scene ever created, full with the expected meatbag grunts one can hear echoing throughout any Gold's. Eventually Sherane gets killed by a jewelry smuggling ring leaving David depressed and partner-less. But don't get too upset because the court system decides to pair David up with his degenerate brother Paul in a very odd plot choice. It seems the court system feels Peter would be better suited as a cop's partner as opposed to pumping weights in prison. Their task is to bring down the criminal ring that killed Sherane while hurling one-liner insults at each other. After they duke it out in the middle of the street, like they're fighting over the last box of muscle milk protein bars, they bury the hatchet and use their energy towards the task at hand. Between the muscles and the mullets the criminal ring clearly doesn't stand a chance.

Double Trouble is easily one of the greatest movies you can choose to wither your Saturday afternoon away with. Especially when you getting ready to watch some wildcard weekend playoff football. Between the movie and the playoff action there will be such a charge of testosterone in the air you may try to power lift your house. After watching David rip a giant satellite dish out of the ground, spin it around over his head, and launch it a mile down the road into the villains car, you will know why we feel so strongly about this movie. We honestly couldn't have added anything else to make it anymore perfect. Every aspect is so ridiculous providing the perfect atmosphere for the true B action fan. Naturally it was released in 1992, the perfect decade for all things B. With cameos from Leaping Larry, David Carradine, and Roddy McDowall there will be a little something special for everybody. If you still have doubts then we ask that you just blankly stare at the VHS cover for a few minutes. That should be all that you need to pull the trigger.",1357344000,2,3586,4.636792452830188
456312,4,6302336678,"This movie is awesome.  John and David Paul are my reason for living!  I would be a cop if it were as cool as it is in this movie. Or a criminal.  My favorite line, ""Politicians are great people, ...everybody should own one.""  The way it just rolls off his tongue.  Just don't watch this movie with someone who doesn't understand the Barbarian Brothers as you will have to beat them unmercifully!",1102550400,7,396,4.444444444444445
456313,5,6302336678,"This movie is seriously radical, daddy.  The action is superb, the acting puts DeNiro, Nicholson, Brando and the like to shame, brother.  The Barbarian Brothers were the finest comedic-action duo since Tango and Cash, brother.  If you like mullets, Camaros, Oakland Raider half shirts, Oakley razorblades, monster trucks, boys with toys being boys, and all things that ROOL, this movie is for you, daddy.  Buy this film now, for hours of entertianment.  Check out Twin Sitters too, Daddy.  I prey to God every day that this movie is rereleased on DVD.  This truly is the finest movie EVER made.  Possibly better than the entire Lord of The Rings Trilogy and without a doubt finer than anything put out by George Lucas.",1020988800,8,718,4.87603305785124

7824929,4,6302336678,"First off it's David and PETER not john and it was released in 1992 and it's a B movie. This movie is full of puns and jokes that make this cop/ crook movie a little bit better than the others. The barbarians were a fun duo to watch on film however a directors nightmare by playing tricks, pulling cars in the parking lot around with a chain and not taking acting very serious. The few films they made are full of fun and enjoyment for the viewer. This movie is at the top of my list.",1477180800,,484,4.052083333333333
