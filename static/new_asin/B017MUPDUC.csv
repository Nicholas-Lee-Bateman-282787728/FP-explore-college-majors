8739795,4,B017MUPDUC,"I did not buy the product, but as a black belt in Karate, and a credentialed teacher, I noticed immediately that Jake is an amazing instructor, very motivational, light hearted, and current.  The video that led me to follow him on YouTube was the bo staff.

The only thing that bugged me about him was a fake contest that led my daughter to waste her time and never receive the prize offered with the video challenge.  Mr. Mace is casting his net so wide, that perhaps he cannot pull it all back into the boat - so anyway no money was lost.  But, he is a powerhouse, and his focus on self is motivational.",1535328000,,605,4.280701754385965
8739796,5,B017MUPDUC,"Ok so I haven't bought the DVD yet, but I literally just finished watching his YouTube videos before running into this and I can already tell he's a great trainer. The simple 15 minutes I spent watching his YouTube videos taught me a great deal to better my fluidity, which is all I'm really looking for.
This guy doesn't train people to go out and spar with Donnie Yen, so if you're looking to become the worlds greatest bo staff user of all ti-blah blah blah, then I'd suggest going and finding someone else.
I can almost guaruntee you'll never need this (in the US anyway) in a real-life fighting situation. It's just for fun and relaxation.",1514419200,,644,4.512820512820513
8739797,1,B017MUPDUC,"As a master level martial artist who has studied (Japanese, Korean, Chinese staff) and teach staff techniques I am always interested in potentially new DVD's and insights.  First, Jace Mace is not his name, it is Jacob Rydberg, and many of his videos are on You tube, for numerous chinese martial arts styles., Tai Chi, Bagua Zhang, etc. etc.  No mention is made of his credentials on you tube or his website, though he offers ranking !! !!  Any potential buyer of any of his videos should search out the many comments made about Mr. Mace (Rydberg) on the internet.  The purchase of the DVD is a total waste of money.
In this video no mention  is made as to where the staff techniques come from, nor an introductory discussion,  though some of the techniques and stances suggests some (not all) of the material is of  or similar to Japanese and Okinawan origin.  Important points of eazch tech nique are missing.  The techniques shown are poorly presented and far from a complete instructional DVD for staff, bo, cudgel.  The skill level presented is intermediate level at best, certainly not even 1st degree Black Belt.  The techniques shown at times are stiff even though to a beginner martial artist they might be impressed by the video.  Yes, the stances are low, indicating a high level of flexibility and good overall physical condition.  The form at the end of the video is more like a cheerleader twirling a baton  than an accomplished martial artist with a proficiency with the Bo, staff, cudgel.  In the form,  an excess of twirls and a few basic techniques poorly done.  One can only think, who contrived this staff form!!!! (probably Mr. Mace).  Though Mr Mace demonstrates enthusiasm a lot of necessary instructional material is missing.  Previous reviewers (buyers), were impressed, though I would expect that they are beginners in the martial arts and are easily impressed.  For beginning martial artists there are numerous high quality videos, whether they be Japanese, Korean, or Chinese styles.  All those videos are presented by authentic master level martial artists who trained in  authentic martial arts styles.  So buyer, beware and do you your homework before purchasing and before enrolling in a physical martial arts school or online school.  Investigate the credentials of the style as well as that of the instructor.  For me this DVD was a total waste of money.

For completeness I went to Mr. Mace's (Rydberg's) You tube videos on the Chinese martial arts (Tai Chi, Bagua Zhang, etc.).  The video's demonstrate almost a complete lack of understanding of the chines styles that he presents.  The footwork is sloppy.  For an internal style such as Bagua Zhang the demonstration is rigid and stiff it looks more like Karate (hard external styles).  In those videos it is clear that Mr. Mace is very flexible and his side and hook kicks and other kicks are very good which may easily win over  beginning martial artists who are easily impressed and don't have the experience or credentials to accurately analyze what they see.  The demonstrations in all the you tube videos give the impression of techniques being mimicked like a robot but a total lack of understanding and mastery.  His presentations of Tai Chi is no better and serious practitioners and teachers of Tai Chi would say this is NOT Tai Chi but a physical workout (exercise program) of Mr. Mace but missing all the important aspects of any style (Yang, Wu, Chen...) of Tai Chi.  Again his you tube video's are well done and presented with enthusiasm but not a contribution for any student wanting to correctly earn a given martial art.

Excellent staff and martial arts videos, by acknowledged authentic masters of several martial arts styles can be found at  plumpub.com  and budovideos.com, YMAA.com,  just to name a few.  Some of the same videos are found on amazon .com as well.  Any new student who takes the time to look at an authentic chinese master performing Tai Chi, Bagiua Zhang and other styles will clearly see what the true art looks like.  Similarly, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Okinawan masters demonstrating the boi, staff, cudgek will also be a wake up call for new students wanting to learn this and other weapons.",1500508800,5,4223,4.875
