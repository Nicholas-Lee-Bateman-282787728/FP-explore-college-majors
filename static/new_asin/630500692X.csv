Please, disregard T.H.E.M. anime and all of their really biased and inaccurate reviews of older anime(they're millennials and don't care for classic anime...so they'll give it 1-star). Big Wars centers on the psyche of a high-ranked military officer who assumes he's on a re-assignment mission during an epic war of man. However, the war is not one of man...it's a war within the mind. All of the greatest fears he has and those who accompany him have are embellished by supernatural forces which nearly push them over the edge. Think of it as a cross between a comic writer from the Heavy Metal magazines mixed with a narration by Rod Serling and you will understand that this movie is worth your money. If you enjoy complex anime, classic style(pre-1993)...then you will thank me for this review. When I first bought this, I was sceptic as to whether it would be worth watching at all because of all of the negative reviews. That changed a bit after I saw it. Try watching it past midnight in the dark too...it enhances the mood of the film(although, I would not categorize this as being horror...more science fiction). I hope those of you classic collectors or new fans of anime pick up this one. Out of the 4 ""Wars"" anime movies...this is my personal favorite(Psychic Wars, Vampire Wars, Venus Wars, Big Wars...I'm not sure if they were all meant to go together but you can find the others separate...Venus Wars being the second best).",1499040000,,1503,4.718631178707224

7881275,3,630500692X,"Some of the end fight scenes are interesting, but overall not a great story.  I recommend paying no more than $9 for this.",1274400000,,122,4.304347826086956
7881276,3,630500692X,"Anime is a wonderful thing.  Until recently, really imaginitive stories simply could not be shot as live action because the cost was prohibitive.  Anime, which is cheap in comparion, has brought us such amazingly imaginitive worlds as Akira, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop and so many more.

WHy do I bring all this up?  Because Big Wars is a imaginitive idea that only works on anime.  And...unfortunetly, it doesn't even work well there.

Big Wars is set on Mars where humans have run headlong into the amrs of the Gods...a strange and ill explained race of angelic women who kick the stuffing out of every human they meet.  The main weapon of the humans is the Land Ship, a counter grav drab green battleship that uses guns and missiles in an age when space travel and terra forming are common place.  Supporting these massive ships are fighters that, during the entire movie never manage to do anything but die, and armored soldiers who, when set against the elfin Gods, fall with alarming speed.  So up went my eyebrow when the human leaders claimed victory at any point.

The main antagonist is the generically named Hell, a massive stealth carrier that wipes out everything that gets close to it and is surrounded by a permanent sandstorm.  Our hero in the movie, who's name I do not remember, gets the newest ship to go out and kill Hell.  ""gasp""

References aside, there is no biblical message here, no deeper meaning to naming these things after various religeous items.  I would suspect translation error was it not for the producing company being american.  Further, this movie has a number unexplained and totally left field themes that the writers make no effort to explain and do not bother to ground them in science, science fiction or even fantasy.  They lie somwhere in the mushed middle ground of the affore mentioned genre.

But I am giving it three stars.  Why you ask, after I have attacked with suck venom?  Because its just fun to watch the onscreen fights.  Push aside the gretuitous sex, needless plot lines and totally braindead character development and one finds a fun and exciting war flick that has plenty of on-screen pyrotechnics and death.  The land ships, as unbelievable as they are for modern warfare, look great with their turrets turning and launchers spewing missiles.  The fighters, even though they really seem to suck, look great.  The alien tech, which is more amorphious and unorigional, include flying saucers and weird walking things with guns.  Even so, its worth a few bucks to watch them rip through the human forces like (insert timeless metaphore here).  And, when the end of the movie comes, you won't feel fufilled...you won't be any smarter...but maybe your bloodlust will be abated for the short walk to your computer and whatever your playing on it.",1098403200,13,2813,4.834728033472803
7881277,5,630500692X,"This movie stinks.  The wars aren't ""big,"" and the big aren't ""wars.""  But there's a lot of smoke and stuff, if you're into that sort of thing.  Instead of this, you should try Big Wars.",1044489600,,186,4.257142857142857
7881278,2,630500692X,"This movie was rather dissapointing to me. If you like action anime movies then steer clear of this one, it doesn't have too much action, except towards the end. The animation is also rather lacking and is rather  outdated, for instance, lots of time when one character is moving and  talking the rest of the screen is completely still",958089600,,335,4.661016949152542
7881279,1,630500692X,"The animation was cool, but the storyline lacked a whole lot of substance. This movie needs a lot more background information for it to be interesting. Also, remember the speeder chase through the forest in Star  Wars: Return of the Jedi? Well, expect to hear those very sound bytes for  the alien fighters in this movie...",957052800,4,323,4.75
