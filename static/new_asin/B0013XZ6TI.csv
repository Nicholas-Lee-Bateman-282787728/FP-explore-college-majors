3120913,5,B0013XZ6TI,"Ah, Tom & Diana of Bayview are BACK!  The third series (season) holds some interesting twists - the pair continue to flummox Harvey Baines, while Jane continues to covet Harvey.  Diana takes on politics, an estate agent scam, helps deliver her great-niece Diana ('not another one,' moans Harvey), sees that Jane gets 'engaged' to Harvey, and still finds time to land in Tom's bed.  The Christmas special is a worthy addition to the collection, and I'm pleased to see it included.  Another review lists the episodes, so I won't duplicate that here.  The series does address - in its own inimitable way - some of the serious issues of aging.  The estate agent scam is only one of them.

I wanted to make note of the infamous ""bedroom"" episode: no US writing team could have done this as well.  From the hilarious wake (a resident left 200 quid so those remaining could get 'legless' in his memory) through the very last scene, all is IMPLIED.  It is so tastefully done, with witty dialogue but actually showing nothing, that the show makes its points without resorting to the vulgarity so prevalent in US sitcoms today.

Stephanie Cole (awarded an O.B.E. in 2005, and who was aged when she took the part) and Graham Crowden (who is still actively performing at age 86) are, as always, stellar as the geriatric dynamic duo.  Daniel Hill as Harvey along with Janine Duvitski as Jane provide the support for the lead pair. The late Andrew Tourelle as Geoffrey and Sandra Payne as Marion add to the fun.

Since this series has a beginning (series/season one), follows a somewhat overall story arc, and has a definite end, please don't make this your first visit to Bayview.  Although each episode - for the most part - stands alone, the best way to visit the 'retirement community for the almost dead' is to see the shows in order.

If you have already visited the place, then WELCOME BACK!  Now we all sit and wait for series four and five - and hopefully we'll get the second Christmas special as well.  (BBC please take note!)",1212537600,9,2023,4.640449438202247
3120914,5,B0013XZ6TI,"Steohanie Cole is a national treasure.  She is adept at drama (watch Tenko) as with comedy.  She and Grahame Crowden have created the perfect odd couple of the geratrics generation.

While most seniors go gently into the night, not Tom and Diana.  They are not going to let the establishment (The Idiot Baines) push them around because they are old.

Tom and Diana have been battling the establishment and Harvey Baines for two series and now for the third round.  Series 3 contains the following 10 episodes and a Christmas special:

The Funeral - The Vicar is suffering from burn-out and cannot even get through a funeral.  So he goes to Bayview to get some rest but Tom has an idea to help.  Tom points his alcoholic/oversexed daughter-in-law Marion his way.  But Marion and Vicar run together.

Two Nasty Kids - Geoffrey decides to run after Marion and presses Tom and Diana into babysitting his two kids (Tom's grandchildren).

Looking for Work - Diana decides to look for a job.  But at her age, it is easier said than done.

Harvey's Fiancee - Harvey finds Ms. Right (Lucy) and wants to intoduce her to Mother.  But Tom and Diana decide it would be fun to pretend to be Harvey's parents.  After they run off Lucy, Harvey has Jane pretend to be his fiancee when Mother arrives.

The Estate Agent - Harvey gets entangled with a beautiful estate agent, who turns out to be even more unscrupulous than Harvey. It takes the dynamic geriatric duo to uncover her evil plot.

Scandal - Following a wild wake, Diana wakes up in Tom's bed.

Sabotage - When Harvey ""borrows"" the money from the vacation fund for his new pet project, it is up to Tom and Diana to correct this.

Politics - Diana is bored, so she puts herself up for counsel.  Harvey also decides to run for the same office.  And Tom decides it would be fun to make it three.

Sleeping Pills - Diana collapses and is rushed to the hospital.  She thinks she is dying and wants to do it on her terms.

Great Aunt Diana - Tom and Diana hijack a bus (the driver would not let them in early even though it is raining.)  Diana's niece Sarah is pregnant.

Christmas at Bayview -  This is the show's first Christmas special.

This show is extremely popular on PBS.  Thank-you BBC for this wonderful show.  No US network would have the guts to make this show.

3120927,5,B0013XZ6TI,"I am constantly impressed by BBC comedy, as every series I have ever seen is consistently well acted and well written.  The actors in Waiting for God are all exceptional and fit their characters incredibly well - perhaps they have actually 'created' their own identities as characters in the true sense of that word.  Diana, Tom, ""The Idiot Baines,"" Basil (the Octogenarian Sex God), Jane, and all the supporting cast act-out some of the most absurdly funny stories, while making the viewer aware of a much more serious subject - the trials and tribulations of growing old in isolated retirement.  Diana & Tom may have done more to reform the way the elderly are treated in the UK than any politician.  I recommend this series to anyone with a 'devilish' sense of humor.  The draw-backs for an international audience are the occasional British-centric political and institutional references. However, the contextual use make them more-or-less understandable if not exactly side-splittingly funny.  Enjoy!",1411344000,,1004,5.204968944099379

Stephanie Cole does an outstanding job with her role as Diana Trent--a senior who does not delight in growing old gracefully, and keeps ""mess"" going on constantly with the ""management"".  Stephanie Cole is a British treasure herself.  She brings something intriguing and special to each role she takes on.  Graham Crowden is her match in this TV show--playing a psychologically challenged Tom Ballard, who ultimately becomes her love interest.  Even seniors can experience romance!  The humor keeps you laughing (realizing it is British humor); story lines are delightful.  The two main character have decided not to just sit down and die in old age . For the American audience this will be unique, for we are so youth focused on our TV shows.  It is so nice to see such talented older faces reflecting (in a humorous way) real life struggles.",1401321600,,934,4.823899371069182

3120936,2,B0013XZ6TI,"I was rather disappointed at seeing how the show managed to drop in quality between Season One and Season Three. In fact, never have I seen a show fall so quickly in standards since Wiseguy! Judging by the other reviews here people aren't judging the shows seriously or apparently by seasons because the Third Season does not compare to the First which was right up there with some of the best shows from Britain.

This seasons was hackneyed, the characters are just old and tired. Whereas previously Diane was funny, she is now just too far in the: I can't stand that woman! isle. She's vulgar, angry, spiteful and just plain unfunny at this point. Diane has no redeeming qualities.

The show started taking a more sexual bent in Season Two and it is even more nauseating in this season. Couldn't come up with anything more original than typical sex jokes, could we?

The characters have changed too broadly since the first shows. In the very first episode Tom's grandchildren were normal kids. His grandson was sorry to see him move out of their home. In these shows we're introduced to two monsters that are now Tom's grandchildren. They are not the same characters we were first introduced to. Neither is Diane. In fact, the show became too broad and ridiculous in it's humor at this point and definitely more crude.

The underlying messages of the ""humor"" has become typical and sour to me. These show are far more political, with the usual lack luster, myopic, Leftist politics one gets from Hollywood or British TV writers. We have to get ear fulls on merits of euthanasia and swipes at businesses that make money. Anything more boring than these stale chestnuts? Then, of course, a fatal does of anti-Christianity that is just brimming over the top. Jane, who is a practicing Christian, is made to be the most obsequious buffoon one hass ever seen! She had been a funny character, but now she's just a target for Diane and Harvey and all the humor that had been there is lost.

Throughout the series up through season three you can see influences of where they pilfered from the best, such as Fawlty Towers: The Complete Collection and the first season it was close to Diane being a female Fawlty, but unlike Fawlty Towers, the makers couldn't keep up with the quality of the first ones and this season really falls flat. At this point, I will just pass on the rest of the series all together.",1358899200,,2401,4.653301886792453

3120939,5,B0013XZ6TI,"We were surprised at how well the 3rd series holds up in comparison to the first one. Most series really start to fall apart, no matter how good initially. Probably it's keeping the original cast, and they are smashing, which does it. The writing does limp a bit on some of these episodes, but is so much better than 99% of U.S. television that we keep coming back for more. I get a little tired of the supposedly prodigious sexual escapades of one of the residents - but I truly like that Dianna and Tom have found themselves enjoying a fulfilling physical relationship. I would recommend it for anyone who likes to laugh, who likes serious subjects served with whipped cream and a cherry on top, and for anyone who likes to see good, seasoned actors at work.

3120942,5,B0013XZ6TI,"As a lover of comedy especially English comedy I thoroughly enjoyed WAITING FOR GOD.  My appetite was whetted when I happened to catch a couple of episodes on TV and I knew I just had to see the whole thing, all three episodes.  The setting is Bournemouth on the southern coast of England, an area with which I am familiar having once lived there.

The story centers around a retirement home for still active seniors. The home is comfortable but the day to day routine is boring. The main characters are Diana, sharp as a whip with an acid wit and a skeptical outlook on life who does not suffer fools gladly. She becomes friends with Tom, a romantic dreamer who mentally is on personal social terms with all of the characters in every low grade B movie ever made.

They seem to be an unlikely couple but the two of them do find romance together. As a  foil to the main characters, Harvey the manager and Jane his assistant are persons unbelievably steeped in stupidity.  Harvey is greedy as well as incredibly obtuse to the point of almost being a caricature. Poor deluded Jane, madly in love with her unlovable boss actually worships Harvey and the dust around him.  Other characters that seem to be vying for the title of Most Stupid are Tom's ultra boring son Geoffrey and his hypochondriac daughter in law daughter Marion.  Added to the mix is a seventy five year old Don Juan living at the home who aims to be a romantic menace to aged ladies everywhere.

My criteria for rating entertainment is the question: Could I stand to watch it again?  WAITING FOR GOD is definitely something to be enjoyed more than once.

For lovers of  English comedy I might recommend SOME MOTHERS DO `AVE `EM,
which is slapstick but barrels of fun.  Also, on a somewhat more sophisticated note watch AS TIME GOES BY.  Both of these are delightful entertainment!  Betty Locke",1227398400,4,1859,4.574018126888218

Waiting for God is delightfully humorous while exploring the lives of ""the elderly inmates"" as Diana puts it, as well as the lives of their relatives and care givers. I have always enjoyed how this series strips away the mask of old age and makes you see the essential human lives that are still thriving for these individuals.

The passions we had when we were younger can still be maintained. My father called my missions "" getting up on my soapbox""; but hay someone has to do it.

Given great possibilities, with a novel background and a novel premise, they perform to all expectations. This is a highly successful series and deserving of huge acclaim, in my view.  It is funny without being crass, it is tasteful without being sloppy, and it is poignant without being - in any way - sentimental. Belly laughs are non existent BUT, great pleasure can be obtained from the very clever and humorous scripts. Scripts, I have to say, that are also very thought provoking at times.

As far as social commentary on the aged goes, Stephanie Cole manages to get a few important points across - most humorously.

This is a very worthwhile series. Those with the ability to see true humour, humor that doesn't rely/depend  upon slap-stick or crudity, but which  relies upon words and situations, will find it hilarious.

3355424,5,B0013XZ6TI,"I am constantly impressed by BBC comedy, as every series I have ever seen is consistently well acted and well written.  The actors in Waiting for God are all exceptional and fit their characters incredibly well - perhaps they have actually 'created' their own identities as characters in the true sense of that word.  Diana, Tom, ""The Idiot Baines,"" Basil (the Octogenarian Sex God), Jane, and all the supporting cast act-out some of the most absurdly funny stories, while making the viewer aware of a much more serious subject - the trials and tribulations of growing old in isolated retirement.  Diana & Tom may have done more to reform the way the elderly are treated in the UK than any politician.  I recommend this series to anyone with a 'devilish' sense of humor.  The draw-backs for an international audience are the occasional British-centric political and institutional references. However, the contextual use make them more-or-less understandable if not exactly side-splittingly funny.  Enjoy!",1411344000,,1004,5.204968944099379

Only the main characters are particularly well presented, the others are more sketched in and simple in their character development.

Stephanie Cole does an outstanding job with her role as Diana Trent--a senior who does not delight in growing old gracefully, and keeps ""mess"" going on constantly with the ""management"".  Stephanie Cole is a British treasure herself.  She brings something intriguing and special to each role she takes on.  Graham Crowden is her match in this TV show--playing a psychologically challenged Tom Ballard, who ultimately becomes her love interest.  Even seniors can experience romance!  The humor keeps you laughing (realizing it is British humor); story lines are delightful.  The two main character have decided not to just sit down and die in old age . For the American audience this will be unique, for we are so youth focused on our TV shows.  It is so nice to see such talented older faces reflecting (in a humorous way) real life struggles.",1401321600,,934,4.823899371069182

3355433,2,B0013XZ6TI,"I was rather disappointed at seeing how the show managed to drop in quality between Season One and Season Three. In fact, never have I seen a show fall so quickly in standards since Wiseguy! Judging by the other reviews here people aren't judging the shows seriously or apparently by seasons because the Third Season does not compare to the First which was right up there with some of the best shows from Britain.

This seasons was hackneyed, the characters are just old and tired. Whereas previously Diane was funny, she is now just too far in the: I can't stand that woman! isle. She's vulgar, angry, spiteful and just plain unfunny at this point. Diane has no redeeming qualities.

The show started taking a more sexual bent in Season Two and it is even more nauseating in this season. Couldn't come up with anything more original than typical sex jokes, could we?

The characters have changed too broadly since the first shows. In the very first episode Tom's grandchildren were normal kids. His grandson was sorry to see him move out of their home. In these shows we're introduced to two monsters that are now Tom's grandchildren. They are not the same characters we were first introduced to. Neither is Diane. In fact, the show became too broad and ridiculous in it's humor at this point and definitely more crude.

The underlying messages of the ""humor"" has become typical and sour to me. These show are far more political, with the usual lack luster, myopic, Leftist politics one gets from Hollywood or British TV writers. We have to get ear fulls on merits of euthanasia and swipes at businesses that make money. Anything more boring than these stale chestnuts? Then, of course, a fatal does of anti-Christianity that is just brimming over the top. Jane, who is a practicing Christian, is made to be the most obsequious buffoon one hass ever seen! She had been a funny character, but now she's just a target for Diane and Harvey and all the humor that had been there is lost.

Throughout the series up through season three you can see influences of where they pilfered from the best, such as Fawlty Towers: The Complete Collection and the first season it was close to Diane being a female Fawlty, but unlike Fawlty Towers, the makers couldn't keep up with the quality of the first ones and this season really falls flat. At this point, I will just pass on the rest of the series all together.",1358899200,,2401,4.653301886792453

3355436,5,B0013XZ6TI,"We were surprised at how well the 3rd series holds up in comparison to the first one. Most series really start to fall apart, no matter how good initially. Probably it's keeping the original cast, and they are smashing, which does it. The writing does limp a bit on some of these episodes, but is so much better than 99% of U.S. television that we keep coming back for more. I get a little tired of the supposedly prodigious sexual escapades of one of the residents - but I truly like that Dianna and Tom have found themselves enjoying a fulfilling physical relationship. I would recommend it for anyone who likes to laugh, who likes serious subjects served with whipped cream and a cherry on top, and for anyone who likes to see good, seasoned actors at work.

3355439,5,B0013XZ6TI,"As a lover of comedy especially English comedy I thoroughly enjoyed WAITING FOR GOD.  My appetite was whetted when I happened to catch a couple of episodes on TV and I knew I just had to see the whole thing, all three episodes.  The setting is Bournemouth on the southern coast of England, an area with which I am familiar having once lived there.

The story centers around a retirement home for still active seniors. The home is comfortable but the day to day routine is boring. The main characters are Diana, sharp as a whip with an acid wit and a skeptical outlook on life who does not suffer fools gladly. She becomes friends with Tom, a romantic dreamer who mentally is on personal social terms with all of the characters in every low grade B movie ever made.

They seem to be an unlikely couple but the two of them do find romance together. As a  foil to the main characters, Harvey the manager and Jane his assistant are persons unbelievably steeped in stupidity.  Harvey is greedy as well as incredibly obtuse to the point of almost being a caricature. Poor deluded Jane, madly in love with her unlovable boss actually worships Harvey and the dust around him.  Other characters that seem to be vying for the title of Most Stupid are Tom's ultra boring son Geoffrey and his hypochondriac daughter in law daughter Marion.  Added to the mix is a seventy five year old Don Juan living at the home who aims to be a romantic menace to aged ladies everywhere.

My criteria for rating entertainment is the question: Could I stand to watch it again?  WAITING FOR GOD is definitely something to be enjoyed more than once.

For lovers of  English comedy I might recommend SOME MOTHERS DO `AVE `EM,
which is slapstick but barrels of fun.  Also, on a somewhat more sophisticated note watch AS TIME GOES BY.  Both of these are delightful entertainment!  Betty Locke",1227398400,4,1859,4.574018126888218

I have always enjoyed how this series strips away the mask of old age and makes you see the essential human lives that are still thriving for these individuals.

3355449,5,B0013XZ6TI,"Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden are superlative actors!

Given great possibilities, with a novel background and a novel premise, they perform to all expectations. This is a highly successful series and deserving of huge acclaim, in my view.  It is funny without being crass, it is tasteful without being sloppy, and it is poignant without being - in any way - sentimental. Belly laughs are non existent BUT, great pleasure can be obtained from the very clever and humorous scripts. Scripts, I have to say, that are also very thought provoking at times.

As far as social commentary on the aged goes, Stephanie Cole manages to get a few important points across - most humorously.

This is a very worthwhile series. Those with the ability to see true humour, humor that doesn't rely/depend  upon slap-stick or crudity, but which  relies upon words and situations, will find it hilarious.

It might just, also, make one think about the aged  - and how they are seen by others.",1215216000,,975,4.831325301204819
