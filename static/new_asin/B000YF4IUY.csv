directed by Lee Frost
approx. 1 hour 28 minutes

Former mondo movie director Lee Frost puts a new stylistic twist on an old blaxploitation theme: strong-willed people who want to stand up to those who disrespect black neighborhoods... ""by any means necessary"".

Thanks to a grant from the California state government, a new organization is formed called ""the People's Army"".  The aim of the organization is to provide clinics and a message of self-sufficiency to the black community.  The group wears brown uniforms and red berets and is clearly modeled after the Black Panther Party.

Unfortunately, a group of white thugs called ""The Syndicate"" is putting the squeeze on local black-owned businesses, forcing them into a gambling racket.  One member of the People's Army named Col. Kojah wants to fight back, but his superior General Ahmed is reluctant to use violence.  When a Syndicate member rapes one of the People's Army's female hospital workers, Kojah is granted the authority to assemble a small security force, strictly for the purpose of self defense.  Little does Ahmed know that Kojah has been planning for this day, having already met with goons that he recruits into this new security detail.

The security force does not shy away from confrontation with the Syndicate, castrating the man who raped the black woman.  However Col. Kojah clearly enjoys the ability to command his violent group and expands his faction at a paramilitary training camp that he's purchased with money stolen from the Syndicate.  To distance himself from the aims of General Ahmed's more timid group, Kojah's guys don all-black uniforms with swastikas on their hats and white armbands. This group continues the same abuses that the Syndicate had perpetrated against the black community and makes more overt threats to white America.  When General Ahmed gets wind of this, it becomes evident that he has lost control over his Army and something has to be done to stop Kojah and his black gestapo.

This movie is interesting, mostly because of the stylistic choices made.  It is attempting to show that becoming too militant leads to a Hitler-like mentality, even going as far as to superimpose the shouting Black Gestapo with footage of the Third Reich.  One thing this movie is missing is women.  Sure there are some females here and there, but their characters are largely insignificant and only there for the men to abuse.  Those looking for a black Ilsa will have to look elsewhere.",1246492800,,2501,5.031553398058253
