936002,4,6304847211,"I fell on the floor with above line by Matt Dillon, to his father, perfectly played by Hector Elizando. And many other lines as well.
Dillon is a young impressionable kid from working-class Brooklyn who is in awe of the part played by Richard Crenna, a charming charlton. Dillon's character is swept up by wealth and the beautiful people and Crenna's character undoubtedly likes the attention. So Jeffrey hangs on to every word and goes home at night and repeats them. It doesnt take long for his true-to-his word father to catch on and call him on it.
The differences in class and values come to a head when Elizando and Crenna meet.
Funny and very entertaining.",1006905600,12,663,4.6752136752136755
936003,4,6304847211,"Whoa! Trip to yester year.... Matt Dillon is outstanding in one of his  earlier and most memorable flicks. A great story well told, we learn that  father really does ""know best"", and that the old-fashioned values  are the only substantial anchor. Fisher Stevens as Hawk is awesome in his  first ""named"" role. Also good is Janet Jones (better-known now as  Wayne Gretzky's wife)--heaven only knows why she never received another  significant role. Too bad the film was marred by a couple of iterations of  the PG-13 word and a nude sex scene (sensitive body parts hidden...)--I  would like to have shown this one to my kids.",968284800,5,623,4.811320754716981
936004,4,6304847211,"Yes, Matt Dillon may ""come of age"" in this film, but Richard  Crenna steals the show as a fat-cat owner of a car dealership who lies and  cheats at gin and thereby teaches young Jeffrey Willis that all that  glitters is not gold.  A lovely bikini-clad Jessica Walter as Crenna's wife  not only brings her impressive acting talent to this film, but also holds  her own (at the age of 43) against the younger bathing beauties that  populate the Flamingo Club.",968284800,,457,4.567901234567901

936125,5,6304847211,"I love movies. All genres .All periods. Drama or humor. I just want to be entertained and feel I am invested in some way. This film is one that I frequently go back and watch for its humor,a young mans coming of age ,and his realization of the importance of family and friendships.
The story is simple. A young man (Matt Dillion) whose future is preset by his loving dad (Hector E.) decides to expand his horizons for one summer working at an upscale swim club and for its members. This experience is eye opening and life changing for a guy raised with a set of working class values. Hard work ,enjoy what you have and and don't reach too high as you will be disappointed are the values drilled into him throughout his life. But now there is a contrast between these two very different set of values (those of a Long Island swim club vs a blue collar working class Brooklynite) and creates confussion as well as excitement. The values of the exclusive swim club set (money and image) differs so much from his familys value of hard work and don't reach too high as you will be disappointed. He has his dreams and he sees his new situation as a way of obtaining what once was unattainable and unthinkable.  Being young he is gullible and trusting. During this summer he alienates himself from his family and puts his trust in the (wrong) people that don't have his interests at heart. There are some very funny scenes during this transition  He still believes in fairness and the the importance of friendship. Those values are not negotiable for him. And there is the rub. The concluding ""eye opening scenes"" have you cheering him on . He has something they will never have. Integrity. The family scenes are heartfelt and wonderfully played by a fine cast. Matt Dillion shows a wide range of emotions that are very convincing. He is not just the toughy he had usually been cast up to this film. He as you now know is a much more substantial actor in all respects.
The cast members are great character actors we have seen and appreciated for years.
A THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE FILM. Funny and touching.",1435968000,2,2094,4.537037037037037

He becomes enthralled by a flashy car salesman (Richard Crenna) who is the reigning king at the gin rummy table and has a beautiful daughter (Janet Jones).

This is a pleasant enough film with good performances and valuable messages about hard work and paying attention to the people who love you.  The only problem was that the screenplay was so clearly written in service of these messages that every single plot strand played out exactly as I expected it to, which made the story feel a bit mechanical.",1275868800,2,744,4.621212121212121
936261,4,6304847211,"""The Flamingo Kid"" turned out to be a real ""sleeper"" for me.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and most everything in between.  This is a ""feel good"" movie that gives us a young man looking to make his start in the world.  His rich buddies introduce him to a Rockaway (NY) resort where he is offered a job.  His father had other ideas and their ensuing relationship is one of the major focusses of the film.  In the meantime there are a variety of characters and events that keep the movie moving along.  In the end, our hero, Matt Dillon, learns a lot of valuable lessons in life.

I think of TV when I think of the director Gary Marshall.  His hit series ""Happy Days"" has to be measured along with the questionable ""Laverne and Shirley"".  I found ""The Flamingo Kids"" to be a professionally done movie.  Perhaps a little more lightly done than some but certainly comparable to the film-making of its' time.  This is a FUN movie.",1242518400,3,931,4.385964912280702
936262,5,6304847211,"At first glance, 1984's ""The Flamingo Kid"" looks like a coming-of-age beach flick. What occasionally attracts me to these types of films is their youthful energy and fun spirit, as well as the babes. It brings one back in time to the carefree time of his/her coming-of-age years. What surprised me is that ""The Flamingo Kid"" is more than just a youth beach flick.

The story takes place in the early 60s where 18-year-old Matt Dillon, a plumber's son from Brooklyn, gets a summer job at a private beach club. This was his final summer of carefree fun before going off to college, but his experiences at the beach club change his plans. He makes loads of money on tips, meets a beautiful blond and becomes fascintated by a new mentor, fast-talking businessman and cardshark Richard Crenna.

Crenna convinces Dillon that there are easier, faster (i.e. dishonest) ways to make loads of money than going off to college for years on end. When Dillon moves out of his house and cancels his college plans it naturally creates some serious friction with his father. Will Dillon go on to become the next generation's fast-talking businessman/cardshark in the mold of Crenna or will he see the error of such an enticing lifestyle?

Almost the entire film was shot on location at an Atantic beach club with loads of gorgeous females on hand, including Dillon's girlfriend in the story, Janet Jones. Cutie Marisa Tomei even has a cameo.

The bottom line is that ""The Flamingo Kid"" offers everything you'd want in such a film and more, including a truly interesting story in which you care about the outcome. And, thankfully, there's NO RAUNCH. In addition the soundtrack includes numerous early 60's hits like ""Runaround Sue,"" etc. What's not to like?

936264,4,6304847211,"Garry Marshall was noted for two things, a great sitcom director and the big brother of Laverne DeFazio a.k.a. Penny Marshall.  This film showed that he could translate his skill from the small screen to the big screen.  And it is written by Garry and Neal Marshall, what a talented family!

In 50's New York City, if you have made it you live in Manhattan, if not, you live in Brooklyn.  Jeffrey Willis is the son of a plumber (Hector Elizando) and lives in Brooklyn.  He has graduated from High School and is the first in his family to go to college.  This is his last summer before becoming a true adult.  His father has arranged a summer office job but he wants a summer of fun.  He gets a job as a cabana boy at the prestigious El Flamingo Beach Club.

Next to sun and surf, the main diversion is gin rummy.  Jeff just happens to be a wiz at gin.  He quickly catches the attention of Phil Brody, the club cardsharp. But things don't sit as well when he catches the eye Phil's daughter (Carole R Davis).  In the end, Jeff decides to go to college.

The 50's was the last decade of innocence.  This film captures this spirit.  While the boys talk a good game, they seldom got anywhere with the girls.  Marshall keeps the film on the right note for high drama to light comedy.

While some may say that this was a star studded cast only Matt Dillon had a solid movie background.  Richard Crenna was a TV star from 50's and 60's.  The remaining cast had TV notoriety but would gain their fame later - Hector Elizondo (Chicago Hope) and Jessica Walters (Arrested Development).  Even Dillon's success didn't happen until this film and later.

Featuring a basic arc of young man finding his way not only across the hudson but to manhood.the main character, jeffrey sets his own path by working on the shore as a cabana boy, emersing himself in struggle against doing right vs doin wrong, following others or following his heart.whether it be listening to his father or trying to impress his father figure brody.desiring acceptance, feeling inadequate, are plights of every young person.this movie explored them rather well and made it a very relatable experience.

I love this dvd.it was a pure joy to see it again.",1493510400,,948,4.716867469879518
