He loves all things Leap Frog and many other educational DVDs, so it's not that he doesn't like such material in general  I personally didn't care for the ""child"" talk, ie, imperfect pronunciation used by some characters to mimic children learning to speak. It is the opposite of helpful to those of us with children who are struggling in this area.",1480723200,,418,4.573333333333333

8223994,4,B000WMFZJC,"We love Paz, but the others characters don't interest my 2-year old little girl as much.  I'd rather have a Paz-only version with more content.  Good video, though.  She does watch it often.",1239580800,2,190,4.696969696969697
8223995,5,B000WMFZJC,"My baby girl loves Paz and his friends,is fast paced and it keeps her attention for the whole length of the DVD. Great for active 2 year olds :)",1233792000,,144,4.0
8223996,5,B000WMFZJC,"My son has always enjoyed watching these shows on TV in the morning. I bought the DVD for a long plane trip (16 hours) and am so happy I did. The shows are enjoyable for him to watch and they teach good values, so I feel comfortable with him watching these shows. I also REALLY love the play all function on the video so that I am not having to constantly pick another show on the menu. Play all will play a Paz show, then a Wilbur, then a Save Ums, then do the second set, so there is some variety. You also get a few extra shows in the bonus features, which is great, because my son also loves Meteor. Since my son will actually sit still and watch this DVD, it is worth the repetitiveness of the shows when he watches it over and over again.",1231372800,2,744,4.033783783783784
