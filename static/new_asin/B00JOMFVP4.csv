8652607,5,B00JOMFVP4,"If you enjoy the films of Brenda Joyce as I do, you will not be disappointed in this one.
It is only about an hour in length which is perfect for this sort of movie.
The picture/sound quality are very good, no trouble there. (Better sound and picture quality than, Whispering Ghosts (1942) which is also distributed by the same vendor.)
This is a fun movie and well worth an hour of your time.",1413072000,2,393,4.324324324324325
