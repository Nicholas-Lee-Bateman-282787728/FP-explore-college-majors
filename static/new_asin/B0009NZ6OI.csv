2304203,5,B0009NZ6OI,"I saw this a couple of weeks ago for the first time and LOVE this movie. Marlo Thomas is just great as the main character with mental illness and her story of bravery. It is just amazing how people with mental illness, especially back when this story takes place, are misdiagnosed, misunderstood, and just plain mistreated. Even since this movie was made 20 years ago, some big strides have been made in understanding, diagnosing, and treating people with mental illnesses. Awesome story of bravery and overcoming.",1166227200,11,514,4.988372093023256
2304204,5,B0009NZ6OI,"A really good movie, i couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. Its a really sad feel good movie. Its about real life Marie Balter who had paranoid schizophrenia in the 60's. They put her on phenathiazine which is really just thorazine. It was way too strong so they put her on librium and she started getting better, she attends college and gets a degree. The second time you watch it you realize its Garry Hixon with OCD. OCD is obsessive compulsive disorder. Obsessive hand washing, flicking lights off and on for days at a time. My hands were raw when i was 22 and the wall turned black after a year of the light switching. It started with my car lights, thinking they were off, and slamming the back gate. NOOOOOOOOOO1 my brother would scream. I got better but my illness was always changing, I took lsd when I was 18 and went crazy, I DIDNT COME BACK FOR FIVE YEARS.  this is a true story, thank you amazon and all you amazing people, love the real marie balter, linda lablotta.",1132963200,,984,4.3478260869565215

2304252,5,B0009NZ6OI,"Excellent movie about misconceptions of mental illness. True story that I saw on TV decades ago, and never forgot it. She had grit and determination!",1435708800,,149,5.0
2304253,5,B0009NZ6OI,"Very good ,true life story of a woman with mental health struggles,who was institutionized for about a 20 yr period,& overcame her problems to get her college degrees,& ended up working as an advocate for many of the patients ,& also ended up working at the same hospital she had been treated at.",1434499200,,296,4.60377358490566
2304254,5,B0009NZ6OI,"I showed this in a trauma group for women who are living in a state psychiatric hospital for criminals.  Marlo Thomas does a very convincing portrayal.  The fact that it's based on a true story makes it all the more moving, disturbing and inspirational.  Marie Balter also has written a book by the same title.  The film portrays Marie's traumatic life and her triumph over her difficulties.",1428710400,,391,4.791044776119403
2304255,5,B0009NZ6OI,At 17 I had anxiety disorder.  I'd have anxiety attacks for seemingly no reason.  It was a struggle for 8 years until I learned and implemented cognitive therapy.  I can relate to this true story.  It is very inspirational.  Marie Balter suffered from anxiety disorder and possibly more.  Back then they just assumed that she was crazy and committed her to an institution.  Most at the institution knew that she'd be back.  She did return.  Watch this story...it's great.  Great performance too!,1428451200,,495,4.926829268292683
2304256,4,B0009NZ6OI,"It was as I remembered it, though a couple of scenes were edited.",1427414400,,65,4.076923076923077
2304257,5,B0009NZ6OI,"All the positive reviews on this movie are dead on so to add on would be repetitive. I can add my own thoughts as a someone who lived very close to Danvers State Hospital.  I remember as a kid driving with my family on Rt 1 and seeing this massive building that looked like a scary castle up on a hill.  Even as a young adult that place scared me and anyone else that wasn't directly connected to the hospital.  We had always heard that this place was a 'snake pit' where terrible things happen.  It was a spooky story that was told in a lot of homes back in the 60's and 70's.  When I was a teenager it was a standing dare to go up on the hill but no one every did it, it was that scary!

I was just surfing online and somehow ended up on a site that spoke about Danvers State Hosp and all the paranormal happenings. That's where I came across a brief story about Marie Balter with a link to her speaking about her time at Danvers State.  She spoke of the hospital in a way that I never heard. I was so surprised and happy to hear that she felt it was a wonderful, caring facility with many great memories.  I was so drawn to her story and her ability to overcome such a terrible position she found herself in as a young girl that extended into being there for 20 years. She is an incredible inspiration to anyone who has suffered with a mental illness. Everything I had ever heard went out the window.  Little did I know that they welcomed the public onto the perfectly manicured grounds. I'm so regretful of the terrible stories that were passed down from generation to generation that kept the public very far from the hospital. What I would give to be able to have seen it up close before they demolished this beautiful building.

I took a drive up there with my husband about 2 yrs ago, I had told him all about the stories I had heard as a kid.  It is now a huge condo complex but there is a little cemetery honoring the patients including Marie Balter.  I sat up there on a little bench trying to imagine what it was like there years ago.  What a beautiful, peaceful place it must have been in it's hayday.

Getting back to the movie, it was wonderful and Marlo Thomas did an amazing job with the blessings of Marie Balter herself.  There are few movies that truly affect me and this was it. While there are many sad elements about poor Marie and the terrible hand she was dealt, it was a very uplifting movie of belief in one's self that you can truly overcome anything with hard work and determination. I think of her from time to time in hopes she is resting in eternal peace.",1427414400,4,2587,4.197979797979798

2304281,4,B0009NZ6OI,When this movie came out on tv years ago it was a motivating element that convinced me that I could work in the field. I am now working in the mental health and substance abuse field. Not all cases should be given up on.,1407715200,,220,4.0227272727272725

2304289,5,B0009NZ6OI,I watched Marlo Thomas on That Girl when I was younger and then she took a role on Friends and I loved them both. In this movie she moved me so much and I really was not prepared it. The movie was a true story and Marlo played the part so well I would someday like to help these people if I could.,1355788800,,297,3.7301587301587302
2304290,5,B0009NZ6OI,"Great movie! Marlo Thomas did an outstanding job in this movie. This movie lets the world know that just because a person has a mental illness,  does not mean that they are finished in life. Marie  went on to get well, after many years of institualization admissions, and now is a speaker and advocate for the mentally ill.  People need to think of a mental illness the same as a physical illness. This movie was very realistic. Great movie and recommened to everyone.",1355011200,2,468,4.614457831325301
2304321,5,B0009NZ6OI,I love watching true life movies. I found this movie quite good. As we know that in society today anything can be accomplished when we open up help to those who need it. In this movie there is an mentally abuse child who is very intelligent but has been abused to believing she is incapable of achieving. A strong will and curiousity prevails to societys advantage when given the chance.,1352592000,,387,4.542857142857143
2304322,5,B0009NZ6OI,"What can I say, except Marlo Thomas shines in this knock out performance.
It is at times very disturbing and sad to watch, but it does have a somewhat happy ending.",1348444800,,164,4.32258064516129
2304323,4,B0009NZ6OI,"I love movies based on true stories.

Marlo Thomas plays Marie Bartello, later Marie Balter, who was hospitalized for over 20 years in a psychiatric facility, but pulled herself up and is now running a half-way house and acting as a patient advocate for the mentally ill.

Ray Baker plays Joe Balter, and you can tell from the name that they were eventually married. Their love story is a tender one, but it is not the main focus of the movie.

A major hero in the story is Dr. Blackwell (Carolina Kava), who was Marie's primary physician. Through her, we learn something of Marie's childhood and how she got to have this overwhelming anxiety psychosis. She had been raised in a convent orphanage, and then adopted by the Bartellos, an old-fashioned Italian-American family that terrorized her. Her mother would lock her out of the house ""to teach her a lesson,"" and when she was 16, she went pounding on the door of a psychiatric hospital for lack of anywhere to go. She attempted suicide any number of times, was put on the locked ward for violent patients for awhile, until Dr. Blackwell rescued her and worked to get her medications adjusted so she could function.

The interesting thing is, the movie goes into a good bit of detail on the nature of her therapy, the steps taken to gradually move her out into the ""real"" world, and they parallel much of my own experiences with the psychiatric world. In the end, the critical factor is people willing to trust her and give her opportunities. However much we may say the patient has to do the work, it takes people willing to help, to trust, to love, to listen. Awareness of that fact, and how lucky she had been in her own recovery, Marie eventually went to college and became a professional. The final scene is her returning to the hospital to give a lecture as a patient advocate.",1336780800,3,1836,4.588414634146342

2304325,5,B0009NZ6OI,"I used this movie in my group at mental health. It made for great discussion of mental illness and how important it is for an accurate diagnosis. It also depicts how doctors,nurses and care takers act towards the mentally ill now and then. My group members enjoyed this movie and could relate to this movie, positives and negatives.",1324425600,,332,4.741379310344827

2304329,5,B0009NZ6OI,This is an excellent story of persistance.  Marlo Thomas' acting is wonderful.  This movie highlights a mentally ill woman who is thrust into the mental health system and seems to be lost there.  It details her struggle to manage her life and find herself.,1243382400,,256,4.7727272727272725
2304330,5,B0009NZ6OI,"The first time I watched this movie I cried so hard I thought my heart was breaking. This is what you go through when you are an unwanted child . The fear, anxiety, belonging nowhere. Marie was fortunate to have a doctor care about her. This movie is very realistic. ""Please do not let me fail,"" said Marie. It takes so much to overcome these traumas, then to be misdiagnosed and given the wrong medication that nearly killed her. Marie had faith through all the obstacles, she succeeded against all odds, very inspirational and full of hope against all the darkness in her life. Overcoming the darkness and fears, she created a facility to help others like herself, after graduating from Harvard. She learned what it means to truly love herself and others.",1209513600,15,757,4.6992481203007515
8063785,4,B0009NZ6OI,"I cannot rate the movie yet, as I have never viewed it. I worked as a volunteer, however, in the late sixties, at Danver's State Mental Hospital. The building itself was a horror, a remnant from a previous era, when treatments of mental illness, developmental disabilities, and juvenile misbehavior were very rudimentary and often quite harmful. People--especially women and children--had often been just dumped into mental hospitals if they did not conform to societal expectations. But when I volunteered at Danvers, a world-famous psychiatrist (whose name I unfortunately forget now), had unlocked the womens' wards, started appropriate programming and therapies, and hired caring, trained staff. Based on Kennedy's ""de-insitutionalization"" movement, patients were being released slowly into the world. Some had lived at Danvers since childhood; they were very afraid to move and had few skills for taking care of themselves. Our main task as volunteers was to teach them how to interact and socialize with people, while the staff worked frantically to teach them daily living skills.  My experience at Danvers was so impacting, that I later went to graduate school and
became a therapist. The benefit for me, from the teaching and modeling by all the staff, and the courage of the patients, has been  immeasurable. I am buying this movie to watch now. Whatever it's quality as a drama, I believe it's worth watching for its historical accuracy.",1519689600,,1448,5.291304347826087
