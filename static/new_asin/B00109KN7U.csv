3048291,5,B00109KN7U,This is a great yoga workout for those of us who are less flexible.  Sara is great at not making you feel dumb if you can't do the pose all the way. The ball really helps with some of the poses. I have some yoga experience but this is great even for first timers!,1296000000,4,263,3.8703703703703702
3048292,5,B00109KN7U,"I hate Yoga!, but after doing this DVD, I change my mind. After having sleeping problems and a lot of stress with work, my Doctor told me I should try Yoga {again}. I had in the pass and it would help me relax, but I could never get into it for long. I have tried in the pass many kinds of work outs, kick boxing,cadio, wights, the gym, you name I've done it and also try other yoga trainers, but she is the best. And doing it on the ball,work soo much better for moves that you may have trouble with standing up. I'm looking into some of her other DVD that are shorter for time when I can't do this one. I would give her a try. she has a very relaxing voice and before getting into any position she takes it slow, and I love the breathing with very position..",1282176000,6,760,4.006578947368421
3048293,5,B00109KN7U,I've been practicing yoga for about a month and I had grown bored with the traditional yoga DVDs. I had used a DVD with this instructor before and I've always loved the stability ball so I decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I decided to try this DVD. Using the ball helps you to work muscles you don't even know you have! The instructor is great and goes at a wonderful pace. None of the poses were so tough that I felt I couldn't handle them which is a nice change from traditional yoga DVDs. The bottom line is if you like the stability ball or yoga and you want to try something new go for this DVD.,1273968000,4,604,4.0
3048294,5,B00109KN7U,This is the perfect beginners workout. I am not to terribly bendy or strong but this tape is definately doable. It gives you the beginners easy option and if that becomes easy she gives you another more challenging option. So it will grow with you for a while. All in all worth the price.,1269216000,5,288,4.351851851851852
3048295,1,B00109KN7U,"I don't feel this is DVD is really for beginners, especially  guys with flexibility issues. Many of the poses, especially in the first half are quite difficult and I feel more suitable for advanced students.

However the second half of the DVD, involving floor work was a bit easier.

Proceed at your own risk.",1259539200,6,310,4.703703703703703
3048296,4,B00109KN7U,"I have many different yoga dvds, including super advanced and this has a definite use for my practice.  the exercise ball helps you to further identify areas of tightness and weakness that you might not be aware of when performing power yoga type practices.  Some of the bonus clips give you preps for handstand and scorpion pose that are great for the lower back.  I hope that the instructor produces another video in this series.",1244160000,5,431,4.72
3048297,4,B00109KN7U,"This is a slower practice that tends to target the lower body and has quite a few twisting postures in it. You could say the slower pace makes things easier, but you could also see it as a chance to fall deeper into your poses.

There are some poses I don't do on the ball, such as Eagle, Temple, Fan and Warrior 3. If you ever feel the ball isn't working for you, simply roll it aside and grab it again when you need it. Remember: it's an accessory, not a necessity.

Sara's right when she says that using the ball might allow someone to get into postures they normally would not be able to get into without its support. But what I personally enjoy about occasionally doing yoga with the ball is that it gives me an opportunity to explore certain poses differently.",1243036800,8,766,4.3125
3048298,4,B00109KN7U,"This dvd features yoga poses that are all done using a stability ball. I've never tried yoga with the ball before, but I found it to be a great addition to support your weight so you can really focus on the stretch. Most of the poses in here are beginner level with the ball mostly used as a modification. There are some sun salutes, lunges, side twists, warrior sequences, etc. I've tried several other yoga dvds and taken a couple of classes, but I got the best stretch out of this one because of the ball.  The instructor was pleasant and provided adequate commentary on form and breathing without going overboard (there is also an option with music only). I would recommend this to anyone who is new to yoga/stability ball, or anyone who is just looking for a great stretch; Intermediate level users might be disappointed with the slower pace.",1231027200,20,847,4.6092715231788075

8237412,1,B00109KN7U,I purchased this DVD as a gift back in July for my husband's birthday in September. After my husband tried it he found that the DVD would stick in the same place and not move forward no matter how many times he removed the DVD and started over. I wanted to return the DVD but since I purchased so early the deadline for returning has passed. If I had purchased this item from a store and still had the receipt I would have been able to return or even exchange. I've learned my lesson.,1378944000,,484,4.159574468085107
8237413,4,B00109KN7U,"This CD is very good.  I needed to return it because it would not play on different ""chapters"".  It went back to the beginning every time.  Just a faulty C.D.",1378166400,,158,4.2
8237414,2,B00109KN7U,I am sure the exercises were good but it did not work.  there was something wrong with the dvd. thank you.,1377734400,,106,4.0476190476190474
8237415,4,B00109KN7U,I really liked using the ball for yoga because it helps support you during the moves which is good for just starting out.,1376524800,,121,4.304347826086956
8237416,1,B00109KN7U,"I ordered this DVD initially this spring and received it in May of 2013.  I was looking forward to trying it and liked the beginning, however about 18-20 minutes into the workout, the disc froze and stopped working altogether.  I tried all of the troubleshooting tips and the DVD was simply unusable on two different devices.  I returned it for a replacement DVD and then got into summer routines with my kids.  When I finally had the time to try the DVD again, the exact same thing happened at a very similar place in the workout on the new DVD.  This time I had missed the 30 day return window.  The workout starts out engaging and fun to do, but it is very frustrating when you get into a workout only to be abruptly halted halfway through.  This technical glitch appears to be a manufacturing issue and I would highly caution anyone thinking of ordering it unless the company is able to fix it or assure you that your DVD is able to function properly.",1374278400,,955,4.422857142857143
8237417,5,B00109KN7U,I do this workout when I need to recover and stretch my muscles. It is very easy to do and using the ball enables you to stretch more than using only your body. I have many yoga DVDs that I have done only once and never felt like doing again but I look forward doing this one once a week or when my body needs it.,1362268800,,313,3.757575757575758
8237418,5,B00109KN7U,This is a fun workout for yoga lovers and core ball lovers. Its great for anyone who has balance issues and lets you do the yoga poses with confidence because the ball keeps you stable. Love it,1356739200,,193,4.243243243243243
8237419,5,B00109KN7U,"This is an excellent workout.  One of the best stability ball workouts I have tried so far.  I have bought many stability ball cds, but this one was different from them all.  I felt satisfied afterwards, like I got a good yoga workout.",1323302400,4,235,4.4186046511627906
8237420,5,B00109KN7U,This was my first time trying this type of exercise and I couldn't be happier.  It is simple enough to understand the first time around and easy enough for me to do @ 310 lbs.  Go for it have lost 50 lbs and maintained with the help of this video.  Good Luck.,1314576000,11,259,3.9423076923076925
