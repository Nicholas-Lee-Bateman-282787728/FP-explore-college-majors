8348859,4,B0021AFMAU,Bought the set for the Master and Commander movie.  So majestic that I had to see it crisper than regular DVD.,1299974400,,110,4.238095238095238
8348860,1,B0021AFMAU,"I bought a two-pack of Kingdom of Heaven and Master and Commander today at Walmart (in store).  They are both Blu-ray.  The two pack was $15.  I don't understand why Amazon, which normally beats everyone's price, is so overpriced on this 3-disk set.",1281225600,2,249,4.744186046511628
8348861,1,B0021AFMAU,"This bundle including Master & Commander, Cast Away, and Kingdom of Heaven = $62

Separately:
Cast Away = $10
Kingdom of Heaven = $12
Master and Commander = $12
Total = $34

All prices are taken directly from Amazon as of 2/23/2010.  Who on earth would *ever* consider paying nearly twice the price for a bundle - which is typically supposed to *save* you money - rather than buy each individually?",1266883200,10,398,4.577464788732394
8348862,5,B0021AFMAU,"Yes, I think these are classic movies, and a great way to build your blu-ray collection.",1262995200,,88,4.5625
8348863,1,B0021AFMAU,"As it stands now, you can buy these movies for about $20 less if you buy separately. Kingdom of Heaven and Master and Commander are $12.50 each, for crying out loud. Who thought this was a good idea? Please don't buy this way.",1258848000,13,226,4.27906976744186
8348864,5,B0021AFMAU,The quality of the Blu-ray disc is fantastic.  The films are even more gorgeous to watch.,1252713600,,89,4.5625
8348865,1,B0021AFMAU,"As you sometimes have to be careful on Amazon, this is a ripoff.  If you buy these 3 BluRay movies seperately, its only $55, but offered here at $76 together.",1248480000,6,158,4.266666666666667
8348866,1,B0021AFMAU,"Amazon is offering a package of ""Master and Commander,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and ""Castaway"" for about $19 more than the three movies would cost if bought separately.  Who would buy this package?",1242691200,10,194,5.0625
