4977490,5,B00687K1CQ,We really enjoyed this video on Christmas cruising. It was very enjoyable. Opened up a new way to spend our Holidays,1388966400,,116,4.571428571428571
4977491,5,B00687K1CQ,I just love all things Christmas. This was very entertaining. Great to watch over the holidays. Would love to do the river cruise and go to the markets.,1388793600,,152,4.464285714285714
4977492,4,B00687K1CQ,"Fun to see some of the traditions, foods and decorations in Europe. Could entice one to plan a vacation in December to go see and sample some of the same sites and goodies.",1388448000,,172,4.242424242424242
4977493,3,B00687K1CQ,"Just so-so...if you want a more upbeat travelogue stick with Rick Steves.  Enjoyed the pictures, but the monologue was bland",1388361600,,124,5.2
4977494,5,B00687K1CQ,Great video with good information. Shows most places we have talked about visiting. Would certainly recommend to all my friends.,1388361600,,128,5.45
4977495,3,B00687K1CQ,We took the same tour several years ago (on a different cruise line.) It a nice evening with the Mrs. to see all those cities again and remember our cruise. Overall quality was a little less then ok and it does seem like an infomercial for the couple that made it.,1388275200,,264,4.196078431372549
4977496,1,B00687K1CQ,Poorly made. Awful camera work and a lot of background noise that interferes with the narrator. I turned it off after 5 minutes.,1388102400,,128,4.608695652173913
4977497,4,B00687K1CQ,"This is a quick film, produced I think in the 1980's by the film quality. It gives a visual preview of the Christmas markets in Europe.

The tour is done via bus and river cruise. I liked being able to see just what the Danube River cruise ships looked like versus the glossy
advertisements one gets in the mail. I now have an idea what a room looks like, meal service, entertainment, etc.

The best part was the brief walking tours of the cities which starts in Prague and ends in Nuremburg. Had I the means I would take a similar tour
through the Christmas markets enjoying the food and the shopping.

Worth a watch if you have 36 minutes to kill and want a travel program that is less factually informative and more visually interesting.
On the other hand I would NOT pay $19.95 to buy a DVD of this program. Use Amazon Prime or your local library.

I gave it four stars because I liked the film footage of the markets- not because it was a masterpiece of film making.",1354147200,2,971,4.318681318681318

8494668,2,B00687K1CQ,Great if you are over 65. Otherwise pretty slow.,1450656000,,48,4.444444444444445

8494674,2,B00687K1CQ,"The material was dated and didn't meet my need to make a choice among river cruise companies.

I think a better choice would be the latest book on the subject by one of the travel titans, like Frommer or Fodor.",1393027200,,210,4.25
8494675,5,B00687K1CQ,"I lived in Europe and got to experience Christmas 3 years in a row.  It was wonderful, the holiday traditions that are hundreds of years old were something you had to see and be a part of to truly understand.  I loved this video taking me on a cruise throughout Europe to see many different holiday traditions.",1389657600,,310,4.421052631578948
