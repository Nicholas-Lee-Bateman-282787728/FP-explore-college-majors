2601910,5,B000G73URC,"One of the best anime and stories i have seen. Very well done and is exciting to watch. Not going to give out info on the story line. But people as wolves, this is Great Anime at its finest .",1237593600,,191,3.8
2601911,5,B000G73URC,Wolfs Rain is truly one of the few beautiful Animes.  It will make you laugh and cry. It also pulls you into the show and makes you feel attached to each of the characters and hope the best for them. The ending is amazing and devastating at the same time it truly holds you there long after the last minuts this is something that any one should watch anime fan or not,1221004800,,367,4.097222222222222
2601912,5,B000G73URC,"I personally just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this anime series for so many reasons. The main one being its about wolves! Either way I personally think its worth buying this set. Not going to lie though, it is kind of depressing but I HIGHLY recommend it!",1221004800,,244,4.444444444444445
2601913,5,B000G73URC,"Bandai has been releasing its series in Boxed Sets, but half series for the longer ones (50 episode) in two boxes sold separately.  This is for the second half of the series.

The first time I saw the finale (NO SPOILERS!) I almost threw the DVD across the room.  Upon viewing this series a second time I come to understand the deep and meaningful message of this show: Good cannot exist without Evil and vice versa.

Without giving away the plot or spoilers, this show continues to excel well into the second half.  The final three episodes are heart wrenching but the ending will still give you a lift (second time for me though!)

This is surely one of the better series produced in recent history and the animation, story, and acting are all top quality.  Yoko Kanno wrote the soundtrack which, like all of her work, fits the story perfectly.

Dai Sato is one of the best anime creators and screenwriters.  He has so far been one of the better writers in this style and genre.

If you like this, also check out Ergo Proxy (though the animation suffers in that show, damn Korean outsourcing), Last Exile (freaking amazing series), or Witch Hunter Robin.  DO NOT be fooled into watching Gilgamesh, it steals so obviously from this plot, just without the wolves...

Pros: Animation, acting, story, one of the creepiest villains EVER
Cons: Disgustingly sad ending

Viewing Preference: English Dub (though it was a close one)",1207267200,3,1424,4.716599190283401
2601914,5,B000G73URC,"I love Wolf's Rain!  I usually only rent DVDs. I had to buy this series!  (Warning - if you are not buying the ""Limited Edition Collection"" in the unique designer box, you will need to buy both ""Complete Collection 1""  and ""Complete Collection 2""  -  or all 30 episodes (minus the ""Recollections"" episodes) to really get the full story.  Unlike many Anime series, this truly is a serialized novel with a beginning, middle and end.
  You can certainly enjoy Wolf's Rain without diving below the surface, or looking for deeper meanings, and if you are happy with that fine! Enjoy! This series has a compelling storyline, endearing characters, beautiful art work and a truly great soundtrack.
  However, some people who watch this series complain about the end.  I think that those viewers haven't realized that, as engrossing as Wolf's Rain is as a standard Quest Fantasy story, at its heart it is an allegory.  It is symbolic of each person's spiritual quest.
  Each of the characters represents a different aspect of the spiritual seeker.  The events that they experience are symbolic of the stages of spiritual growth that spiritual seekers go through, and the choices a spiritual seeker needs to make - with their consequences.
  I have studied comparative religions for many years.  There are aspects of a spiritual journey that are portrayed in Wolf's Rain that are found in Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions (especially Sufism), in North American Shamanism, in Hinduism, and in modern psychology.  However, the spiritual journey portrayed in Wolf's Rain is most deeply informed by Vajrayana Buddhism. If you understand the basic world view of Vajrayana Buddhism, you will understand the ending.
  If you want to learn more about the type of spiritual quest described in Wolf's Rain, or if you just want to understand what the series' creators were trying to say, I'd like to recommend a few easy to read, easy to find books ""The Dark Side of Light Chasers"" by Debbie Ford; ""Open to Desire - Embracing a Lust for Life"" by Mark Epstein, MD; and ""Entering the Stream - An Introduction to The Buddha and His Teachings"" Edited by Samuel Bercholz and Sherab Chodzin Kohn (Especially look at Chapter 21 - The Oxherding Pictures and Part 4 on Tantric Teachings.)
  If you really want to dive deep, I would also recommend, ""Man and His Symbols"" by Carl Jung; and ""The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious"" by Carl Jung.",1206576000,5,2421,4.938118811881188
2601915,5,B000G73URC,"This is a must see for the soft anime fan.  it is not hard core but it is a really great series.  For you guys trying to get your girl interested in anime, this is the way to go.  It will make you laugh and cry!  Although I tend to like the sci fi and martial art side of anime, this was really touching.",1206403200,,304,3.703125
2601916,5,B000G73URC,"This is the second collection of this anime. After watching the first one, I could not wait to watch for the finale of what would be happening to the characters in the story. Chapter to chapter, I understood why they are doomed to have their fate and all the surroundings. Some is good, some others are quite sad. More or less, it is considered as unexpected. I realize some reviews are against this anime. I do not know why the reviewer can grade it low scores. I never felt bored bythe story. This is amazing. But I can recommend this anime to anyone who loves mystery, detective stories, even thrillers.",1191888000,7,606,4.5181818181818185
2601917,5,B000G73URC,"First off, I've just got to say, I loved Wolf's Rain. This series is beautiful. From the animation to the music to the plot. Everything is wonderful... I especially loved the end to this series. Here's why. (and I won't spoil much, so it's safe to read)

The first half of the series really pulled me in. It caught my attention and held it. But when I started to watch this, I really could not stop, I watched this in one sitting. The last few episodes were incredible. True, there was a certain ambiguity to the ending, but all in all, everything was wrapped up nicely. As you learn more about the pasts of the wolves, Cheza, and the other characters and as they search out Paradise, things really start to fall apart. While watching this, you'll be wondering, will they find Paradise, what cost will they have to pay to get there? And you'll find out. You may not like the end, but I actually found it to be very beautiful.

The only thing I'll spoil is this, you'll probably need a kleenex or two...the last 5 or so episodes had me in tears nonstop.

Even so, I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone willing to watch it. It's great.",1170979200,10,1136,4.374407582938389
2601918,5,B000G73URC,"While this does say it is the complete collection, it is only the second half of it. There is an actual Wolf's Rain Box set available that does contain the entire series. This is not it.

This collection contains the last half of the show and is, in my opinion, the greatest set of ending episodes in any anime I have ever seen. As Kiba, Toboe, Hige, Tsume and Cheza continue their search for paradise, getting continuously closer, so too are the nobles and Darcia to attaining paradise for their own means. As the humans Cher, her ex-husband Hubb, and the Wolf hunter Quent also become increasingly entangled between the oppressive nobles and the truth of The Book of the Moon, the setting is set for the most gripping set of episodes I have ever witnessed. By the time the series reaches its climax, an emotional attachment will have been achieved between the viewer and the characters that pulls you into the story and makes you truly feel for all the troubles and heartache they experience. The last half of Wolf's Rain is filled with drama, action, suspense and surprise occurances throughout. There is just no way you can see this show and not be in awe. I highly recommend this collection for anyone who is a fan of great entertainment, anime or not. The story, characterization, and voice work (not to mention the wonderful music provided by Yoko Konno) Wolf's Rain will draw you in regardless. So whether you buy the series in a two part collection or get the full box set elsewhere is up to you. Either way, you won't be disappointed.",1158192000,39,1544,4.614545454545454

8129250,5,B000G73URC,"Its Wolf's Rain. In the distant future (or could it have been the last age of the world) wolves are extinct, or so they'd have us believe. The few wolves who still live actually take the form of humans to hide. All wolves search for Paradise a utopian world for wolves, and Kiba is so exception. He is drawn to the city by the scents of Lunar Flowers and their he meets Tsume and Hige and Toboe. A more mix matched pack there never was, but the four set out to find Paradise with the help of the Flower Maiden Cheza",1409443200,,515,4.108910891089109

8129253,5,B000G73URC,"I had the first four disks separately and it was a fine enough series to purchase the rest.  Note that Wolf's Rain: The Complete Collection I (the first four disks) is also available.  Chinese rip-offs (so the artists never get royalties) of all seven disks are available.  If you look around you may very well find that I & II are cheaper than buying a legitimate box set of all seven disks.
Note that legitimate box sets will always have the company logo on the packaging.",1357689600,,474,4.488372093023256
8129254,5,B000G73URC,"One of the most amazing and addicting animes you'll find. If you love both anime and wolves, then this is your set. The animation, picture and sound are all great. The music in it is also awesome. The opening theme Stray totally rocks and the ending theme Gravity and beautiful. And there is a also a background song on the first disc and it is so beautiful with the lyrics ""Where the lamb lies down with the lion, where the wolf is one with the wild"". The last episode has the most gore and blood. Wolf's Rain really brings out your inner wolf.",1298246400,,545,4.300970873786408
