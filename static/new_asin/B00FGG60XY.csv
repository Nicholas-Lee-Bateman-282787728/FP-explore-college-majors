5991598,4,B00FGG60XY,"This is a slight, charming, well-acted and perhaps too short (it could have benefited from a bit more plot and character development) romance about what we do and what we sacrifice in the name of love  to parents, to children, to ex-lovers, and to potential lovers. It is also the story of Paul (not Roy) and how his journey to sobriety and maturity has an impact on those who love him and those whom he loves. Very enjoyable, even if not deep. I mean, how many coming out, AIDS related films do we really need?",1387584000,10,511,4.378947368421053
5991599,1,B00FGG60XY,"I was expecting myself to like this movie based on the proceeding positive reviews; however, I found myself getting more annoyed as the movie went along until the final scene that completely sent me over the edge.  Paul (Eric Aragon) and Gavin (Jason Gaffney) have little chemistry, and Gavin is a complete saccharine cliche.  I was also perplexed by the complete abandonment of any character development of Roy (Roger Stewart), particularly when you consider that he was the centerpiece of the story initially.  However, what bothered me the most was the self-assured narcissism that allows someone to completely ignore the inherent awkwardness if not shamelessness of falling for their friend's ex-boyfriend.  How many people hook up with their close friend's ex-lover?  Even if it sometimes happens, it certainly causes tension or at least reflection.  This movie doesn't even hint at either.",1387497600,11,895,5.3120567375886525
5991600,4,B00FGG60XY,"A good romantic story, is a good romantic story, no matter the sexual orientation. This was a sweet story with plenty of simple twists and layers. I enjoyed it very much.
The only thing I would have enjoyed more would have been a little more real chemistry between the two main characters Paul and Gavin. Their kiss was right up there with Vin Diesel's movies, a bit of a mood killer.",1387497600,3,384,4.422535211267606

5991602,5,B00FGG60XY,"I loved it. I may be a romantic and this film is a pure romantic comedy. But what is truly great is that it also covers a real family who has its real issues  of alcoholism, alzheimer's disease and marriage gay and straight all coming to a head at christmas which they face together. If you want a warm, fun, not too serious, and romantic movie with a great cast to make u laugh, then this is the movie. Enjoy!",1386979200,19,410,4.125
5991603,5,B00FGG60XY,I really loved it.  I was utterly adorable and I loved the it.  Great movie for the holidays and great if you are a fan of Suzanne Brockmann.  Great that her book All Through the Night got a role.,1386547200,8,196,3.9743589743589745

5991605,4,B00FGG60XY,"The Perfect Wedding is the most perfect romantic charmer I've seen in a long time. Kudos to the writers for giving us a story with some depth and respect for the human condition, which as we know, is far from 'perfect.' I disagree with reviewers who claim the movie is ""light"" ""fluffy."" Though the writers and director handle the heavy stuff with a light touch, there is nothing fluffy about substance abuse recovery or Alzheimer disease. Paul, the recovering alcoholic and serial relationship killer, struggles. His sister struggles with being honest with her mother regarding HER wishes for her upcoming wedding plans. Their parents struggle with a debilitating disease...YET in the midst of all this struggling, they find and discover a deep and abiding love and respect for one another. One of the most romantic and honest declarations of love I've seen on film is in this little indie. Eric Aragon (Paul) delivers a solid performance, and doesn't disappoint in this touching and high moment in the film. What a sweet picture. And the ending provides a wonderful poetic irony that even this hardcore cynic had to give a shout-out.  The editing is excellent, the cinematography beautiful (love Sarasota, Florida--been there and love it in this movie). On a political note, that this film was shot in Florida (anti-gay marriage; anti-mixed adoption), may be a political statement. Not sure if that's what the writers and director intended, but I thought I'd point that out. The the lead characters are adopted across ethnic, racial lines. In addition, a gay marriage takes place there (presumably--at least in the movie). Rent it, enjoy it and tell your friends.",1386547200,30,1664,5.050909090909091

5991607,5,B00FGG60XY,"A charming film where the love interests just happen to be gay. I'm a Suzanne Brockmann fan, and my favorite inside joke is when Paul recommends her book ""All Through the Night"" to Gavin (actor Jason T. Gaffney's real life mom).",1484524800,,228,4.585365853658536

5991617,3,B00FGG60XY,"It's worth watching once; the storyline is decent enough and the acting not terrible, although it seemed the main male actors were trying to be too restrained.  All in all, not a bad way to kill a couple of hours",1445644800,,212,4.3
5991618,4,B00FGG60XY,"From the judgment of this film, being gay is not a matter of concern at all. Maybe in ten or twenty years time this can come to be true. But, according to the movie, its not a problem at all being gay. Not a sole character states any concern about it, and the loves of the gay triangle love happening in the film could very well be a straight one. Only it would be hard to accommodate the situation with only three people.
Taking that of, the film turns out to be very pleasurable, making you laugh as well as cry. We must forget the environment of realities, for instance, how could Gavin go to the bus station without anyone noticing, and how did he get there if no car was available. These questions abound throughout the movie, but they didn't take that smile from your face.  Its a film made to pleasure, and it certainly does. No major conflict, just the usual misunderstandings of a rom com. The actors play well, and being a group of chunks doesnt make the movie less enjoyable, thats for sure. A film for all audiences. Hey straight people, thats how to look and behave toward gays, ok?",1445126400,,1095,4.367647058823529

5991646,3,B00FGG60XY,"This was...not great. Not dreadful, but not great, either.

I (obviously) ignored the several rather strongly-worded negative reviews because it seemed like a lot of people like this one, but maybe I should have paid attention. I'm not sure whether to blame the acting or the writing. Much of the movie came off as stilted and fake, and my first thought was that the actors didn't have the chops to pull the story off...but the longer I watched, the more I started to wonder whether at least part of the problem was that the writer(s) aren't good at natural dialogue, and the actors themselves just didn't have good enough material to work with. Regardless, though, there was an ever-present sense of ""real people don't sound like that when they talk to each other.""

It's too bad; some of the more minor characters weren't badly done at all. I liked the parents, for instance. But the main lead - Eric Aragon, who plays Paul - kind of stunk.

It wasn't just stilted dialogue, either; the plot had some pretty big problems...the biggest probably being the fact that Paul and Gavin met and fell in love in a matter of hours. Can that sort of thing happen in real life? Sure, I suppose. (Or, at least infatuation can come on that suddenly.) But for a movie to be successful, it needs to not only tell a story, but sell it. We viewers need to buy into it, and I'm afraid that I simply wasn't invested in the relationship working out.

(spoilers ahead)

There were other things off, too. Paul goes into a big confession about how he's an alcoholic, and how he was all screwed up from being adopted, and none of that rang true at all. Or, rather, I've known people who overshare, but I certainly don't go all moony-eyed over them when they do. The whole time that scene was playing, I was thinking, ""wow, awkward."" (Actually, Paul was awkward pretty much throughout. His apology to the ex for being an awful boyfriend? It was dripping with overacted melodrama.) There was the scene when Gavin tells Paul he's moving to California for six months. Paul, naturally, looked like someone had just vivisected his hamster, but I mostly just wanted to shoot him a look of incredulity and say, ""dude, it's only six months and you've known this guy for all of twelve minutes - what's your problem?"" And there was little stuff, like how Gavin and the ex were all super awkward about sharing a room. Weren't they also exes of each other, and BFFs? I didn't really get why they were being so weird about everything.

(End spoilers)

I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that it was a huge cliche. Lame.

It wasn't all bad, I suppose. Like I said, the actors who played the parents weren't terrible, and they in particular had some funny moments. Paul is a hottie, and even though he was kind of a goober, he was nice to look at. And perhaps most importantly, the story itself was a nice, calm, low-stress, low-impact sort of story that's kind of nice when real life gets kind of heavy. (Though there are probably plenty of people who would dislike it for that very same reason, since it's not very thrilling or dramatic.)

So, 2.5 stars. I didn't hate it. I'm not sitting here wishing I had the last hour and a half of my life back. I do kind of regret paying the $3 to rent it, though.",1426291200,,3272,4.485714285714286

Its story touches on many topics including dealing with illness, familial obligations, homosexuality, and addiction, and treats each of these in a non-sensationalizing way.

5991651,5,B00FGG60XY,"The cover choice for this excellent film was unfortunate, making it appear like a flat out wacky comedy when it is in fact a witty film that touches on serious themes.  The hero, Paul (Eric Aragon), is a recovering alcoholic trying to overcome his past as a hard drinking jerk.  His father, played by the terrific James Rebhorn, is wrestling with early onset dementia.  And Paul's ex shows up at the wedding planning session for Paul's sister's upcoming nuptials with his ex, Gavin (Jason T. Gaffney), in tow because he's ashamed to appear like a lonesome loser.  As the the scope of the wedding spins wildly out of control, Paul and Gavin fall in love, but are stymied by the deception in play.  The movie is both gentle and thoughtful and a genuine case is made for the pairing of Paul and Gavin rather than the arbitrary love-at-first-sight.

It's commendable that there were several family issues that were addressed but I think maybe by doing so, the focus of the film got muddied.  I kept watching because I had already invested so much time into it even though I know an irksome ending is coming.  Finally, I just couldn't stand it and stopped watching probably with about 10 minutes left.  The acting is not that great and the main characters are not very sympathetic, especially the ""lovers"".  They really have no chemistry together.  I don't want them to have a happy ending.  Their scenes together are more awkward than anything.  I've been on a gay film binge lately and this is the only film where I don't root for the main couple.  Don't let the film fool you into thinking that Paul really has changed.  He remains an ass and his actions are still hurtful, despite any reprieve.  I'm quite surprised that so many reviewers liked this film so much.",1416441600,,1073,4.679144385026738

The Perfect Wedding is probably what she hopes will be not only for her own son, but for all the sons and daughters out there, and day after day the dream is coming trueer and nearer. Paul and Gavin were not only perfect for the movie, all the supporting cast was perfect. The movie is a romantic comedy, exactly what I wanted to see, and what I needed right now. It was sweet, deeply romantic, even a bit sexy without being the sex on screen: I think Paul and Gavin just kiss two time in all the movie, but sex wasn't necessary, and the connection between Paul and Gavin was evident even if they didn't touch each other.

It's a gay clone of every Doris Day movie made half a century ago, but even stupider. Day had millions of devoted fans, as does this movie, apparently, but I don't fit in either group.

The only person in it who is even worth looking at is Roger Stewart as Roy the loser. He's fascinating and very, very attractive, but he's wasted on a stupid role in a stupid movie. I'd never seen him before, so discovering him is the one good thing I got from this movie and almost compensates for not being allowed to give it zero stars. All the other actors (and their characters) are as boring as mud - especially the two toothy, brainless Frog Prince mimbos in the middle.

5991698,5,B00FGG60XY,"Just finished watching ""The Perfect Wedding,"" A Small Or Large Production, released by Arcadia Creative.
Co-written by married screenwriting team of New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Brockmann and EDGAR Award finalist Ed Gaffney, ""The Perfect Wedding"" is simply a charming movie about the lengths people will go to to try to make other people happy while attempting to not only pull the wool over their eyes, but others as well.
Paul's sister is getting married and the family is getting together over the Christmas holidays to plan the wedding.  Only problem is their mother wants a large, over the top wedding because Paul's father has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease so that he will never forget.
Now throw into this mix the fact that Paul is a recovering alcoholic whose been dry for 18 months, and the fact that the former party boy's sister has invited his ex-boyfriend who cons Gavin, his best friend, into pretending that they're a couple.
Yep, you guessed it, a completely reformed Paul falls hard for Gavin, but can't act on his feelings because that would hurt his ex-boyfriend.
Yep, there is a perfect wedding, but that would be giving away a spoiler.
An utterly charming movie.
Highly Recommeded!

5991711,5,B00FGG60XY,"This movie is not just about Paul and Gavin getting to know one another and like each other. It's also about the planning of a wedding for Paul's sister, who really just wants a small wedding, but her mother is planning on a big one. It's also about Paul's parents and their coming to terms with the fact the husband is in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's. The movie is somewhat predictable, and turned out like I thought for the most part. I consider it t be much more romantic than a comedy. However, part of this movie left me feeling sad personally for Roy, mainly because I experienced a somewhat similar, yet different situation with a guy I was interested in and a friend getting together. I identify more with Roy, and got the feeling that Roy secretly wanted Paul back. It seemed he realized this after Paul gave a very sincere, heartfelt apology for cheating on him before, and how he's turning his life around. There was a scene where Roy was looking for Gavin, but he found Paul instead. And Roy mentioned that he feels it's great that Paul is turning his life around. You get the feeling that Roy is about to say something more (possibly about getting back together), but then Roy is called away. Then when Paul's sister got married, Roy noticed a certain chemistry between Paul and Gavin. And also Roy seemed to be smiling as he saw Paul dancing at his sister's wedding, as though maybe he was starting to fall in love with him again. However in the end when Gavin left, Paul's sister suggested about Roy and Paul getting back together. I think Paul would have liked to say yes, but he put aside his feelings, knowing that Paul and Gavin had more of a chemistry going on between each other and were perhaps better suited for each other.

This is definitely a movie you should see.",1388793600,,1797,4.495412844036697
5991712,5,B00FGG60XY,"When Roy is asked to help plan the wedding of his friend Alana, he hesitates at first, because it means facing Alanas adopted brother Paul, a former alcoholic with whom he had a nasty breakup.  He asks his friend Gavin to come along and pose as his boyfriend.  Complications set in when the now-sober Paul seems to have lots in common with the (actually single) Gavin.

One of the many reasons I love this film is that it is not a gay film, per se, although it has the aforementioned openly gay characters.  They are just part of a great ensemble cast of family (and family), with their sexuality just a minor detail in the qualities the group celebrates in each other.  The story touches on love and dedication, remembering the things that are truly important in life, and actually deals with changes in a marriage from years ago (Paul and Alanas parents, played by character actors Kristine Sutherland and James Rebhorn), Alana and her fianc, as well as another marriage proposal still to come.  This is a heartwarming, amusing story that gay viewers do not have to hesitate a second to share with family and straight friends.

A drama, a tragedy, a comedy, a dark comedy, a disaster movie? Maybe they thought up the story for this one in gay, teen summer camp, somewhere. While its supposed to be about finding love and celebrating it, its also about alcoholism, dementia, relationships going badly, miscommunication, adoption, and an endless list of other subjects thrown in willy nilly throughout the film. I just wished it would end, at some point.
What makes it more tragic( there it is, that must be the genre) is  that the actors really do try to do a good job in their respective roles. They mean well, they just don't know what they've gotten themselves into.
