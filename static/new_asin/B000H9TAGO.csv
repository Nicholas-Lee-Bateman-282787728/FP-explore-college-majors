2632542,5,B000H9TAGO,This is a cute show about a football announcer who pretends and creates a local winning football team.  He announces these scores over the radio causing both conflict and happiness.  This man is able to give his town a dream....a dream that helps them become united.  My six year old son loved the movie.  This is a great family movie!,1246579200,,335,4.533333333333333

8137855,5,B000H9TAGO,This is a cute show for families -- especially football families.  I had seen it before and bought it for my husband because it takes place in his home state of Oklahoma and uses names of real towns and football teams although not accurately.  This is a feel-good show that shouldn't offend anyone.,1351123200,,298,4.60377358490566
8137856,5,B000H9TAGO,"What a great movie about a town and their high school football team! It all revolves around the man who is the ""Voice of the Possums"" on their hometown radio station. The football team hasn't scored a touchdown in 14 years let alone win a game--that must be over twenty years. The town votes to do away with the team. Even the team captain states he is tired of being every school's homecoming game so they are guaranteed a win. Will Clark, played wonderfully well by Mac Davis, won't let the football team die. He broadcasts games, at his own expense as the lone sponsor, to keep the team alive. They have a winning season and even play in the state championship--all fictional of course, but that doesn't stop the town and high school players in believing in themselves once again and taking pride in the town and school. The ""real"" state champions show up and challenge them to one last game. The game in itself seals the belief that they can achieve something if they work together. Wonderful family movie that teaches the value of believing in yourself and helping others to believe in themselves, too.",1294099200,2,1107,4.624365482233503
