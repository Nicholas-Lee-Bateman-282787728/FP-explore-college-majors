3009977,5,B000XXWKFW,"I've been waiting for years for a VHS or DVD of the US TV episodes.  They're finally out.  We have about 200 Smurf figurines bought years back and it gives us pleasure everytime we look at them in thier display case.  Gee, I guess we're Smurfaholics, or Smurfiacs or something.  In any case, this series was the most cleaver series on TV aimed for kids and hijacked by us adults.  We'll Smurf them over and over until we Smurf up. LOL!",1203724800,,435,4.320987654320987

3009979,5,B000XXWKFW,"I've been waiting forever for this set and was just about to hit the pre-order button when I noticed ""Season 1, Vol. 1""",1200096000,6,119,4.217391304347826
3009980,5,B000XXWKFW,"I've been hooked on the Smurfs since I was in the Navy, in 1983!  Back then, it was the only thing on TV on Saturday mornings.  I love this series, and can't wait.  I don't know why it took so long!",1197158400,18,198,3.7804878048780486
3009981,4,B000XXWKFW,"The 80's gave us a golden age of Saturday morning cartoons. I can't think of any other era that had such a wide variety of different themes and approaches. These days most shows fall into the Japanese anime/card game genre. Back then you had several genres. One of them was the child friendly, parent approved, sugary sweet cutesy cartoons. The Smurfs has to be the top of the heap of those shows. The reason being was good production values and solid pacing of their stories which makes even a sedate and ""safe"" show fun to watch.

My first experience with the Smurfs wasn't this television. In fact my first exposure to the little blue creatures were in the form of little plastic figurines sold at the local Hallmark card store. I only knew of them as different little blue guys who wore different clothes that apparently denoted their profession or interest (I personally had the Karate Smurf and the Police Smurf) and they were created by somebody named Peyo (according to box that held the Smurfs). The television translation of the only thing I know about Smurfs was different, but appropriate.

You see every Smurt in the cartoon has some characteristic, trade, or skill that sets them apart from the rest. In this colony of 100 Smurfs you would have a baker, poet, carpenter and other useful trades along with Smurfs who were lazy, clumsy, vain (and were named as such). Each episode was about their interacting with each other and their surroundings based on who they were. Top it all off with a Papa Smurf to keep them all in line and a human wizard named Gargamel who wants (of all things) to eat the Smurfs and get the gist of show.

This simplistic premise was all you needed to make a fun, if overly cutesy, series that would evolve each season with new characters and themes. One of the most memorable things about the show was the use of classical music played in it's full brilliance. Not toned down or ""lightened up"" for the kids. It helped give me a good appreciation of the genre of music at a young age. The animation was solid and the style of the show actually lended itself to the limited frames per second that Saturday morning cartoons were stuck with to keep their budget low.

Some might overly analyze the show and see things like how the Smurf commune and soceity promote communism. To be honest that's what they were. Communists. Everybody helped out in the betterment of their society as a whole and apparently everything was shared. The theory of communism would actually work in such a small community if done right, and the Smurfs didn't have such hangups over greed and power that normally keeps any utopian ideal from happening... or at least Pappa Smurf was always there to keep his Smurfs from taking it too far.

What you are getting in this DVD set is the first half of the first season. The original plan was to put all 28 episodes onto one set, but apparently the studio changed their mind and now you get 19 episodes. Still that's six hours of content. On top of the standard eps you also get two bonus features: The Smurfs Springtime Special (an Easter holiday special) and Smurfs: The Music Video (which is not much more than the title theme with clip highlights of the show set to the music). Not much else on the extras category.

The good news is this DVD set has been remastered and Warner Home Video announced that the episodes are uncut. For purists that's really the only important thing. Don't expect Dolby Digital or anything like that. This is strictly a monophonic affair just like the show was back in the 80's. If you have kids and don't want them to see anything too violent or socially disruptive then this is a good show for you. For those of you who remembered the Smurf from when you were kids and long for their return here you go.",1196985600,82,3797,4.560117302052786
3009982,4,B000XXWKFW,"I have been waiting for eons for the Smurfs to come out on DVD!  In my research, I found that this cartoon was in Dutch.  Imaging my surprise when it came out in box set in September!  Yes September!  I purchased the box set on Amazon that is now showing unavailable........and it had six full discs of numerous episodes....so what's the difference between that one and this one with 2 disks?....Well I'm Smurfing all I can get before it disappears again!

The only thing that makes me hesitate to buy this is that it is season one volume one. I wonder if Turner is planning to release a special edition ""complete series"" box set at a later date.

If they were smart, the publisher would sell each of these dvd's with limited edition smurf figurines.",1194566400,29,438,4.341463414634147

3010063,5,B000XXWKFW,What can I say? It's perfect as I remembered it. At first I thought that it might have quality picture issues because it was a cartoon made so long ago and sometimes even as DVD's they are not very good when shown on a LED modern TV. But I don't notice any quality issues on this one. The picture is smooth and colorful and the menu is very attractive. A great price for lots of episodes.,1423440000,,388,4.118421052631579

The Smurf music is famously classic, there is no language that children should be protected from, the stories are interesting, when a Smurf is rude to another Smurf there are consequences and the one who was rude apologises... its a good cartoon series for kids who's parents care about what their children watch.

3010100,4,B000XXWKFW,"I loved this show growing up. My little brother used to force me to watch it while we waited for Bugs to come on. It grew on me something fierce!!! The Amazon download looks and sounds better than the original (not HD, but good enough). I'm deducting 1 star for Amazon's assinine download service. I purchased Season 1 and was told I could DL them. Found out you can only DL them to a couple devices that are Amazon compatable at a time. And even then it's a chore to FIND the DL app for just the PC let alone other platforms!!! It's not an ""own"" service, it's a ""use as we see fit"" service.

I know how irritating it is to read a review and have people slash stars for something other than the product itself. But this is what they want me to review (the DL versions). And I gladly would have paid more money for the lower resolution DVDs to not have to deal with this crap!

Edit: K, the sound is ""metallic/echo"" in nature. I can't get my receiver to compensate for it. Even tried 2.0 stereo. Nothing gets rid of it. Not going to deduct a star for it though. The sound issues are easily ignored if you actually get into the stories. And the misery of the Amazon download service is far worse imho!",1347408000,,1199,4.208695652173913

3010109,5,B000XXWKFW,"This is great, classic Smurfs as I remember them!  After taking my kids to see the new Smurfs movie (which is great, btw), I had to get my favorite childhood cartoons and introduce my kids to those as well.  And where best to start at but the beginning?  I was thrilled that The Smurfette was here, episode 2 to be exact, along with the creation of Painter (if you watch it's when Vanity Smurf creates a double in the mirror) and so many more lovable Smurf episodes!  19 in all!  So very, very worth it for only $9.49!  My 5 year old can't get enough, she has been alternating between disc 1 and 2 since it arrived, falling in love with Smurfette and hating Gargamel, laughing at Jokey's ""presents"" and Brainey every time the other Smurfs toss him unto his head out of the village (ringing any childhood ""smurfbells"" for any Smurf lovers out there yet?"")  I fell in love with this 2 dvd set, and I know you will too if you loved Smurfs as much as I did!  Now, time to order more Smurfs!  Ah, if only my Mom hadn't sold my Smurf playset at that garage sale long ago, grrr.",1313107200,2,1071,4.236453201970443

3010111,5,B000XXWKFW,I'm so pleased with my purchase. The quality of the sound and visuals are good and it was just as if I was watching it when I was young girl. I bought it to relive the good ol' days when I was young and have no regrets. A definite keepsake. All the episodes in this Season 1 Volume 1 pack are entertaining.,1297728000,,306,3.9516129032258065
3010112,5,B000XXWKFW,"since the cartoon came out years ago but did not know how much until I walked into Macy's Department Store in Allentown, PA this Holiday Season and saw them. I had to get one and he currently has a permanent place on my bed. The reasons that I had to get one were twofold: the second reason was to introduce my 5-year-old grandson to smurf and to do that I had to get the CD so he could watch it. I cannot say how he liked it because so much was going on but will see him again where we can really watch it without any interruption and I will let you know how he likes it. I, on the other hand, luv the CD always did. It is refreshing to see young people listening to and obeying their elders. I read one of the reviews on this and that person equalled their lifestyle to communism? I never thought of the smurfs that way maybe because I've never experienced it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Smurfs-Season-One-Vol-One/dp/B000XXWKFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Smurfs - Season One, Vol. One</a>",1295827200,,1040,4.815642458100559
3010113,5,B000XXWKFW,"It is a clich now, but I remember the Smurfs from my childhood.  What Peyo has done here is create a new mythical creature alongside elves, trolls, imps, and fairies.  Some of those creatures also appear in the cartoon.

For adults, the Smurfs are fascinating from a sociological standpoint.  The claim made on various websites that The Smurfs is communist propaganda is farfetched but the Smurfs do practice an informal socialism.  All resources in the Smurf Village are shared and Smurfs work for the good of the community, not to acquire the wealth of their neighbors.  There is a very strong sense of community among the Smurfs.

For children, there are messages about sharing, friendship, respecting the wisdom of elders, and mercy.  One episode even has an environmental message.

The Smurfs live in a forest that is full of possibilities.  Some of these possibilities present a danger to the Smurfs.  Then the happy background music becomes ominous.  The music, by the way, is based on actual classical music pieces.  So don't be surprised if you recognize music on this DVD from a music appreciation class or vice versa.

This DVD set contains the first half of cartoons that were aired during the first season of The Smurfs.  To get the entire first season, you will need to also order Season One, Vol. 2.",1275782400,,1314,4.829596412556054
3010114,5,B000XXWKFW,"I love this set. I remember the best cartoons being from when I was a kid, and sitting down to watch the Smurfs with my son after it arrived completely proved me right. I will definitely get the second set. Good stuff! Now, if they could just start producing Paw Paw Bears....",1267574400,,276,4.326923076923077
3010115,5,B000XXWKFW,"Purchased this along with Panasonic DVD for long plane trip to Hawaii.  As kids never heard of smurfs or seen it before, this kept their attention the whole flight.  Now my kids are fans of the smurfs too. Great for the plane ride and made it fun to fly again.",1261526400,,260,4.18
3010116,5,B000XXWKFW,The Smurfs bring back fond memories of my childhood. I enjoy watching them as an adult.,1260576000,,87,4.5
3010117,4,B000XXWKFW,"First, let's start off with the something bad about this product: the packaging. I'm not a very big fan of Studio Peyo artwork (the style used following Peyo's death in 1992), and while this may be acceptable for the independent foreign video distributors to use, in the case of Warner Home Video's release, WHY USE IT?!? I mean, doesn't Warner Bros. have access to any sketches of the cartoon characters from Hanna-Barbera Studios that could have been used for the packaging to make it a bit more legit that this is a 1980s cartoon show created by them with Peyo's licensed characters? Another big bone of contention I have is that the image of Papa Smurf on the front cover is very disturbingly creepy to look at, particularly next to the image of Smurfette. It doesn't help that his image is used on men's underwear with the saying WHO'S YOUR PAPA on it. Yeah, good idea, let's further sexualize the character by putting him on inappropriate clothing!

WIth that out of the way, here's the something good: the use of the 1981 intro sequence. This hasn't appeared since the cartoon show stopped running on Saturday mornings and the syndicated version, Smurfs Adventures, continues to air to this day with Gargamel's ""ravage the land as never before, total destruction from mountain to shore"" rant as part of its intro sequence. It appears on the video just the way that it sounded back when it first appeared on television, narration included, no alternate ""carnival music"" like in the Australian video release version.",1249344000,,1521,4.85
3010118,5,B000XXWKFW,"We were talking about cartoons we grew up on and how the new cartoons are not really what I would call a cartoon.  Sat down and watched the Smurfs while working.  What a great cartoon!  There is always a lesson, a little adventure and always ending on a happy note!  That's what cartoons are supposed to be like.",1239667200,,312,4.327586206896552
3010119,3,B000XXWKFW,"Great to have Smurf episodes in all in one place.  Volume terrible.  Menu screen is normal but episodes are SIGNIFICANTLY lower.  Still, its great to be able to show a cartoon that I loved as a kid to my 5 year old son.",1237593600,,219,4.046511627906977
3010120,5,B000XXWKFW,I loved the Smurfs when I was a child and revisiting them now is a great treat.  My fiancee bought me the Smurfs Volume 1 for my birthday and it was the best gift.  The video quality is super and the color quality brings the little blue guys to life.  It is totally worth getting this collection.,1236556800,,296,4.157894736842105
3010121,5,B000XXWKFW,Loved these little blue bastards as a kid and still love the cartoon as a grown up!  This first part of 2 sets gives you the beginnings of Smurfette and the crazy searches Gargamel and Azreal his cat get into as they try to capture the Smurfs.  It would have been amazing if the entire season was put as one set as other classic tv shows have been put on dvd but it works!  If you loved the Smurfs this is for you!  Has a few extras and fun for all.,1236211200,,449,3.901098901098901

3010126,5,B000XXWKFW,"I watched the Smurfs every Saturday when I was growing up and these DVD's present the cartoons just the way I remember them.  The picture quality is excellent, the sound quality is excellent.  I can't wait for the next volume to come out!",1229558400,,238,4.511627906976744
3010127,1,B000XXWKFW,"I did the math. Every 3 episodes is one hour, that makes 2 half-hours
for every three episodes. That makes 19 episodes six hours long, 12
half-hour episodes. Even if you count the Springtime special that would
make it about 13 half-hour episodes for $19.99. That makes it $1.50 a
half-hour episode. With Volumes sets we get cheated. Other shows like
the Partridge Family: Season 4 there are 22 half-hour episodes for
$19.99, around .91 cents per half-hour. For a whole season of the
partridge family we get 9 episodes more for the same price as this
volume set. This volume set of the Smurfs is not worth the price. I am
going to wait until the price goes down to $13.99 or less.",1228348800,6,679,4.483870967741935
3010128,5,B000XXWKFW,"This box set is great, have been waiting for a long time for the Smurfs to finally come to DVD. Why all one season couldn't have been in it's own box set instead of splitting it up into two sets is beyond me but great set nonetheless. Included on this dvd are episodes:
The Surf's Apprentice, The Smurfette, Vanity Fare, King Smurf, The Astrosmurf, Jokey's Medicine, St. Smurf and the Dragon, Sorcerer Smurf, The Smurfs and the Howlibird, The Magical Meanie, Bewitched, Bothered and Besmurfed, Smurf-Colored Glasses, Dreamy's Nightmare, Fuzzle Trouble, Soup a la Smurf, All That Glitters Isn't Smurf, Romeo and Smurfette, The Hundredth Smurf, Smurphony in 'C', and bonus episode: The Smurfs' Springtime Special.

This classic '80s animated series returns as you witness the amazing adventures of tiny beings called the Smurfs.  They may be blue, but they all have big hearts.  With a cast consisting of the wise Papa Smurf, the strong Hefty Smurf, the witty and rather obnoxious Brainy Smurf, the narcissistic Vanity Smurf, the tone-deaf Harmony Smurf, and of course Smurfette; these little creatures always have big fun in their village hidden way deep in the woods.  But where there is good, there is evil, too.  That evil is the sinister wizard Gargamel and his pet cat Azrael, who always try to catch the Smurfs for his evil doings.

The DVD set has 20 episodes including ""The Smurfs' Springtime Special"" plus a mashup music video.

So if your smurfing for something abso-smurf-ly different, you'd better smurf on over to your favorite DVD store and get ""The Smurfs"" on DVD.  And since it's volume one of the first season, the rest should be smurfing along real soon.  Gee, I'd better smurf - er, stop - before I get too excited !",1207267200,,1125,4.67005076142132
3010154,5,B000XXWKFW,Smurfs were my favorite cartoon as a kid - when you see them as an adult you realize how much the quality of cartoons has changed - definately more graphic intensive now.  My kids thought the smurfs were a little goofy at first - but now they are running around the house pretending to be Gargamel and Azrael cathcing smurfs - and the five year old asks to watch it every night.,1207267200,,378,4.25
3010155,5,B000XXWKFW,"This is a great collection.  The picture quality and sound is excellent. I bought this for my wife since The Smurfs was one of her favorite cartoons when she was younger.  Well, now our two year old son has discovered the wonderful world of Smurfdom thanks to this DVD set and I can't wait to get the next release.",1207008000,,314,4.305084745762712
3010156,5,B000XXWKFW,"We remember the Smurfs from 25 years ago. My son was an avid fan and Papa Smurf was his hero. He dressed up as a Smurf for Halloween. We still have old Smurf toys.

We saw that this DVD was available and purchased for my granddaughter (aged 4). My granddaughter has watched the Smurf's DVD everyday since it arrived. She has been captivated by the Smurf's DVD. She now sings the happy Smurf tune when she plays. The picture quality is much better than expected.",1206835200,,461,4.423529411764706

audio tracks so I bought it to give to my niece who only
speaks SPANISH and lives in Mexico.  After receiving the dvd
we discovered it DOES NOT HAVE SPANISH audio tracks.  My niece
was very happy when she received this dvd for her birthday, but
was soon very sad and upset when she didn't understand the
English words.
Don't buy this dvd if you are buying for the same reason!

3010160,4,B000XXWKFW,"I got this set and like a kid, watched it on Saturday morning.  As others have already said, there is no side B on disk 2, but everything that was to be on side B is on side A.  The opening of each ""episode"" is not what I remember from the show.  I remember Gargamel saying a spell something like ""total destruction from mountain to shore"", but this opening has a narrator talking about good and bad.  This is supposed to be season 1, so it might have been different for just this season and as a kid I just didn't notice.  The other problem I have is that some of the shows seem out of order.  In one episode we see a re-occurring character who people seem to already know, a few episodes later we meet that character and nobody knows his name. The other problem I had was with the sound.  The title screen was at a normal volume, but when I played the show, I had to turn the volume up much higher than normal.  I loved the Smurfs as a kid, and I still love them now as an adult.",1204502400,,981,4.020618556701031

I can't believe it's finally here!  I've been a fan since I was a kid and am also a person who doesn't buy alot of DVDs - but the one thing I've been waiting for is the Smurfs on DVD! I must say the packaging is boring and I think they could have done better for this long awaited release.  Hoping this first DVD is a success so they can do more for the dedicated Smurfs fans like me who want something even more special to hang on to and watch over and over.
Looking forward to season 2!",1204070400,,668,5.110091743119266
3010164,5,B000XXWKFW,"I haven't seen this show since I was about 7 years old (about 20 years), and I have long-been-awaiting this release. After several announcements and a couple of rescheduled release dates, it's finally here!!!

The DVD set is well worth the price. I honestly don't like that there's so few episodes on here in comparison to how many were made, but it's a great start. The box itself is very colorful and even poppish-style accents around the charecters and writing to enhance its visual enjoyment. I really like that neither one of the two discs are double sided, like they were in ""Josie & The Pussy Cats"", and ""The Flintstones"" season sets. You get two single-sided discs which also looks great sitting inside the case. And the picture quality of the cartoons are great, as well. Hard to believe these cartoons were made more than 25 years ago. Very bright, colorful, and very little dust or dirt (and I watched them on an HDTV).

So, if you're a Smurf fan, go grab this smurfin' great DVD collection and tell Warner Bros. they need to release more soon. This set has me craving more sSmurfs more than any other cartoon set they've released lately. Must send more Smurfs to DVD...and smurfin' soon.",1204070400,6,1199,4.677725118483412

3244477,5,B000XXWKFW,"I've been hooked on the Smurfs since I was in the Navy, in 1983!  Back then, it was the only thing on TV on Saturday mornings.  I love this series, and can't wait.  I don't know why it took so long!",1197158400,18,198,3.7804878048780486
3244478,4,B000XXWKFW,"The 80's gave us a golden age of Saturday morning cartoons. I can't think of any other era that had such a wide variety of different themes and approaches. These days most shows fall into the Japanese anime/card game genre. Back then you had several genres. One of them was the child friendly, parent approved, sugary sweet cutesy cartoons. The Smurfs has to be the top of the heap of those shows. The reason being was good production values and solid pacing of their stories which makes even a sedate and ""safe"" show fun to watch.

My first experience with the Smurfs wasn't this television. In fact my first exposure to the little blue creatures were in the form of little plastic figurines sold at the local Hallmark card store. I only knew of them as different little blue guys who wore different clothes that apparently denoted their profession or interest (I personally had the Karate Smurf and the Police Smurf) and they were created by somebody named Peyo (according to box that held the Smurfs). The television translation of the only thing I know about Smurfs was different, but appropriate.

You see every Smurt in the cartoon has some characteristic, trade, or skill that sets them apart from the rest. In this colony of 100 Smurfs you would have a baker, poet, carpenter and other useful trades along with Smurfs who were lazy, clumsy, vain (and were named as such). Each episode was about their interacting with each other and their surroundings based on who they were. Top it all off with a Papa Smurf to keep them all in line and a human wizard named Gargamel who wants (of all things) to eat the Smurfs and get the gist of show.

This simplistic premise was all you needed to make a fun, if overly cutesy, series that would evolve each season with new characters and themes. One of the most memorable things about the show was the use of classical music played in it's full brilliance. Not toned down or ""lightened up"" for the kids. It helped give me a good appreciation of the genre of music at a young age. The animation was solid and the style of the show actually lended itself to the limited frames per second that Saturday morning cartoons were stuck with to keep their budget low.

Some might overly analyze the show and see things like how the Smurf commune and soceity promote communism. To be honest that's what they were. Communists. Everybody helped out in the betterment of their society as a whole and apparently everything was shared. The theory of communism would actually work in such a small community if done right, and the Smurfs didn't have such hangups over greed and power that normally keeps any utopian ideal from happening... or at least Pappa Smurf was always there to keep his Smurfs from taking it too far.

What you are getting in this DVD set is the first half of the first season. The original plan was to put all 28 episodes onto one set, but apparently the studio changed their mind and now you get 19 episodes. Still that's six hours of content. On top of the standard eps you also get two bonus features: The Smurfs Springtime Special (an Easter holiday special) and Smurfs: The Music Video (which is not much more than the title theme with clip highlights of the show set to the music). Not much else on the extras category.

The good news is this DVD set has been remastered and Warner Home Video announced that the episodes are uncut. For purists that's really the only important thing. Don't expect Dolby Digital or anything like that. This is strictly a monophonic affair just like the show was back in the 80's. If you have kids and don't want them to see anything too violent or socially disruptive then this is a good show for you. For those of you who remembered the Smurf from when you were kids and long for their return here you go.",1196985600,82,3797,4.560117302052786

3244597,4,B000XXWKFW,"I loved this show growing up. My little brother used to force me to watch it while we waited for Bugs to come on. It grew on me something fierce!!! The Amazon download looks and sounds better than the original (not HD, but good enough). I'm deducting 1 star for Amazon's assinine download service. I purchased Season 1 and was told I could DL them. Found out you can only DL them to a couple devices that are Amazon compatable at a time. And even then it's a chore to FIND the DL app for just the PC let alone other platforms!!! It's not an ""own"" service, it's a ""use as we see fit"" service.

I know how irritating it is to read a review and have people slash stars for something other than the product itself. But this is what they want me to review (the DL versions). And I gladly would have paid more money for the lower resolution DVDs to not have to deal with this crap!

Edit: K, the sound is ""metallic/echo"" in nature. I can't get my receiver to compensate for it. Even tried 2.0 stereo. Nothing gets rid of it. Not going to deduct a star for it though. The sound issues are easily ignored if you actually get into the stories. And the misery of the Amazon download service is far worse imho!",1347408000,,1199,4.208695652173913

After taking my kids to see the new Smurfs movie (which is great, btw), I had to get my favorite childhood cartoons and introduce my kids to those as well.  And where best to start at but the beginning?  I was thrilled that The Smurfette was here, episode 2 to be exact, along with the creation of Painter (if you watch it's when Vanity Smurf creates a double in the mirror) and so many more lovable Smurf episodes!  19 in all!  So very, very worth it for only $9.49!  My 5 year old can't get enough, she has been alternating between disc 1 and 2 since it arrived, falling in love with Smurfette and hating Gargamel, laughing at Jokey's ""presents"" and Brainey every time the other Smurfs toss him unto his head out of the village (ringing any childhood ""smurfbells"" for any Smurf lovers out there yet?"")  I fell in love with this 2 dvd set, and I know you will too if you loved Smurfs as much as I did!  Now, time to order more Smurfs!

3244609,5,B000XXWKFW,"since the cartoon came out years ago but did not know how much until I walked into Macy's Department Store in Allentown, PA this Holiday Season and saw them. I had to get one and he currently has a permanent place on my bed. The reasons that I had to get one were twofold: the second reason was to introduce my 5-year-old grandson to smurf and to do that I had to get the CD so he could watch it. I cannot say how he liked it because so much was going on but will see him again where we can really watch it without any interruption and I will let you know how he likes it. I, on the other hand, luv the CD always did. It is refreshing to see young people listening to and obeying their elders. I read one of the reviews on this and that person equalled their lifestyle to communism? I never thought of the smurfs that way maybe because I've never experienced it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Smurfs-Season-One-Vol-One/dp/B000XXWKFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Smurfs - Season One, Vol. One</a>",1295827200,,1040,4.815642458100559
3244610,5,B000XXWKFW,"It is a clich now, but I remember the Smurfs from my childhood.  What Peyo has done here is create a new mythical creature alongside elves, trolls, imps, and fairies.  Some of those creatures also appear in the cartoon.

For adults, the Smurfs are fascinating from a sociological standpoint.  The claim made on various websites that The Smurfs is communist propaganda is farfetched but the Smurfs do practice an informal socialism.  All resources in the Smurf Village are shared and Smurfs work for the good of the community, not to acquire the wealth of their neighbors.  There is a very strong sense of community among the Smurfs.

For children, there are messages about sharing, friendship, respecting the wisdom of elders, and mercy.  One episode even has an environmental message.

The Smurfs live in a forest that is full of possibilities.  Some of these possibilities present a danger to the Smurfs.  Then the happy background music becomes ominous.  The music, by the way, is based on actual classical music pieces.  So don't be surprised if you recognize music on this DVD from a music appreciation class or vice versa.

This DVD set contains the first half of cartoons that were aired during the first season of The Smurfs.  To get the entire first season, you will need to also order Season One, Vol. 2.",1275782400,,1314,4.829596412556054

3244614,4,B000XXWKFW,"First, let's start off with the something bad about this product: the packaging. I'm not a very big fan of Studio Peyo artwork (the style used following Peyo's death in 1992), and while this may be acceptable for the independent foreign video distributors to use, in the case of Warner Home Video's release, WHY USE IT?!? I mean, doesn't Warner Bros. have access to any sketches of the cartoon characters from Hanna-Barbera Studios that could have been used for the packaging to make it a bit more legit that this is a 1980s cartoon show created by them with Peyo's licensed characters? Another big bone of contention I have is that the image of Papa Smurf on the front cover is very disturbingly creepy to look at, particularly next to the image of Smurfette. It doesn't help that his image is used on men's underwear with the saying WHO'S YOUR PAPA on it. Yeah, good idea, let's further sexualize the character by putting him on inappropriate clothing!

WIth that out of the way, here's the something good: the use of the 1981 intro sequence. This hasn't appeared since the cartoon show stopped running on Saturday mornings and the syndicated version, Smurfs Adventures, continues to air to this day with Gargamel's ""ravage the land as never before, total destruction from mountain to shore"" rant as part of its intro sequence. It appears on the video just the way that it sounded back when it first appeared on television, narration included, no alternate ""carnival music"" like in the Australian video release version.",1249344000,,1521,4.85
3244615,5,B000XXWKFW,"We were talking about cartoons we grew up on and how the new cartoons are not really what I would call a cartoon.  Sat down and watched the Smurfs while working.

3244618,5,B000XXWKFW,Loved these little blue bastards as a kid and still love the cartoon as a grown up!  This first part of 2 sets gives you the beginnings of Smurfette and the crazy searches Gargamel and Azreal his cat get into as they try to capture the Smurfs.  It would have been amazing if the entire season was put as one set as other classic tv shows have been put on dvd but it works!  If you loved the Smurfs this is for you!

half-hour episodes. Even if you count the Springtime special that would
make it about 13 half-hour episodes for $19.99. That makes it $1.50 a
half-hour episode. With Volumes sets we get cheated. Other shows like
the Partridge Family: Season 4 there are 22 half-hour episodes for
$19.99, around .91 cents per half-hour. For a whole season of the
partridge family we get 9 episodes more for the same price as this
volume set. This volume set of the Smurfs is not worth the price. I am
going to wait until the price goes down to $13.99 or less.",1228348800,6,679,4.483870967741935

3244632,4,B000XXWKFW,"I relived my childhood watching this DVD set. It's cute, funny, harmony-promoting and sometimes profound.
For example, in the show ""The Smurfette"", it proved that by treating people with kindness and forgiveness, you can change people. It has subtitles.

3244642,4,B000XXWKFW,I watched Smurfs way back and it is still good for the little ones.  The only problems with the DVD are the corny intro instead of the one I remember from way back and the fact that there should have been more shows on the DVDs for the price. (We are talking about a tv show that aired more that 20 years ago after all.),1208649600,,320,3.923076923076923

3244650,5,B000XXWKFW,"Now here's a good series to add to your classic cartoons collection: ""The Smurfs: Season 1, Volume 1"".

This classic '80s animated series returns as you witness the amazing adventures of tiny beings called the Smurfs.  They may be blue, but they all have big hearts.  With a cast consisting of the wise Papa Smurf, the strong Hefty Smurf, the witty and rather obnoxious Brainy Smurf, the narcissistic Vanity Smurf, the tone-deaf Harmony Smurf, and of course Smurfette; these little creatures always have big fun in their village hidden way deep in the woods.  But where there is good, there is evil, too.  That evil is the sinister wizard Gargamel and his pet cat Azrael, who always try to catch the Smurfs for his evil doings.

The DVD set has 20 episodes including ""The Smurfs' Springtime Special"" plus a mashup music video.

So if your smurfing for something abso-smurf-ly different, you'd better smurf on over to your favorite DVD store and get ""The Smurfs"" on DVD.  And since it's volume one of the first season, the rest should be smurfing along real soon.  Gee, I'd better smurf - er, stop - before I get too excited !",1207267200,,1125,4.67005076142132
3244651,5,B000XXWKFW,Smurfs were my favorite cartoon as a kid - when you see them as an adult you realize how much the quality of cartoons has changed - definately more graphic intensive now.

We saw that this DVD was available and purchased for my granddaughter (aged 4). My granddaughter has watched the Smurf's DVD everyday since it arrived. She has been captivated by the Smurf's DVD. She now sings the happy Smurf tune when she plays. The picture quality is much better than expected.",1206835200,,461,4.423529411764706

3244657,4,B000XXWKFW,"I got this set and like a kid, watched it on Saturday morning.  As others have already said, there is no side B on disk 2, but everything that was to be on side B is on side A.  The opening of each ""episode"" is not what I remember from the show.  I remember Gargamel saying a spell something like ""total destruction from mountain to shore"", but this opening has a narrator talking about good and bad.  This is supposed to be season 1, so it might have been different for just this season and as a kid I just didn't notice.  The other problem I have is that some of the shows seem out of order.  In one episode we see a re-occurring character who people seem to already know, a few episodes later we meet that character and nobody knows his name. The other problem I had was with the sound.  The title screen was at a normal volume, but when I played the show, I had to turn the volume up much higher than normal.  I loved the Smurfs as a kid, and I still love them now as an adult.",1204502400,,981,4.020618556701031

I must say the packaging is boring and I think they could have done better for this long awaited release.  Hoping this first DVD is a success so they can do more for the dedicated Smurfs fans like me who want something even more special to hang on to and watch over and over.

3244661,5,B000XXWKFW,"I haven't seen this show since I was about 7 years old (about 20 years), and I have long-been-awaiting this release. After several announcements and a couple of rescheduled release dates, it's finally here!!!

The DVD set is well worth the price. I honestly don't like that there's so few episodes on here in comparison to how many were made, but it's a great start. The box itself is very colorful and even poppish-style accents around the charecters and writing to enhance its visual enjoyment. I really like that neither one of the two discs are double sided, like they were in ""Josie & The Pussy Cats"", and ""The Flintstones"" season sets. You get two single-sided discs which also looks great sitting inside the case. And the picture quality of the cartoons are great, as well. Hard to believe these cartoons were made more than 25 years ago. Very bright, colorful, and very little dust or dirt (and I watched them on an HDTV).

So, if you're a Smurf fan, go grab this smurfin' great DVD collection and tell Warner Bros. they need to release more soon. This set has me craving more sSmurfs more than any other cartoon set they've released lately. Must send more Smurfs to DVD...and smurfin' soon.",1204070400,6,1199,4.677725118483412
