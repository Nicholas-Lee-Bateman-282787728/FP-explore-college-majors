8117355,4,B000F4RHS4,"The film was over 20 ears old but James Wood and Jane Alexander had surpurb performances. The movie adhered to the book quite well. The only major criticism I had was the omission of the daytime PT boat attack on the USS Maddox on August 2 at the beginning of the movie which Stockdale also participated in. It would have added context to the night operation two days that actually was the lead action in the movie. The August 4 night action was deeded by both Stockdale and the afloat commander's after action assessment that no attack had occurred. The false radar returns common in the Gulf of Tonkin had completely spoofed the nervous radar operators. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution authorizing U.S. retaliation against North Vietnam was passed the next day by Congress. It was based on the early reports that a second attack had taken place when, in fact, no second attack had occurred. Stoctdale was also a lead commander of the retaliation attack the next day on the North Vietnam PT boat base that was the first U. S. action of what turned out to be eight years of hostilities. Stockdale kept this information to himself during five years of  torture during his seven years as a POW of North Vietnam and no doubt served to enhance the justification for the Medal of Honor awarded him after his return home.",1503100800,2,1310,4.646551724137931
8117356,1,B000F4RHS4,"As a veteran of the Vietnam Air War, I wondered why I'd never heard of this made-for-television movie until the year 2015. Now, I know why. It's extraordinarily bad... actually worse (if you can believe it) than ""Flight of the Intruder"" which was a cinematic insult to former Navy pilot, Stephen Coonts, who authored the riveting novel by the same name. There has yet to be a well-crafted motion picture about the infamous air war that killed an estimated 100,000 Vietnamese civilians between 1965 and 1975.",1481587200,,507,4.906976744186046

8117358,4,B000F4RHS4,"IN LOVE AND WAR is the true story of the highest ranking American Vietnam War prisoner, and his 8-year ordeal of torment and interrogation.

In 1965, Navy Commander Jim Stockdale's fighter plane is shot down. He's captured by the North Vietnamese and sent to Hoa Lo prison (aka the ""Hanoi Hilton"") where Stockdale (Woods) is subjected to almost daily torture. During nearly a decade of internment, he develops a clandestine communications system with other prisoners and organizes a resistance group against their inhumane captors.

Stockdale's wife Sybil (Alexandra) has been urged by the military to keep quiet about her husband. She instead contacts other POW wives and they pressure the American government to disclose what's known about their spouses. The wives' coalition also demands a public admission that our men are being physically abused in Hanoi. These efforts make Sybil an international celebrity.
