8081863,4,B000B5XPHY,"Jack Perrin's best days as a cowboy hero were during the silent 1920's. He later appeared as the lead in several low budget early sound efforts but by the late 1930's had drifted strictly into supporting roles. The two features presented here are from Jack's last gasp as a cowboy star and leading man. He's not too bad, but hardly memorable, perhaps a tad too old for the roles he plays, but competent and somewhat likable. As for his acting ability, let's just say he's WAY better than Buffalo Bill Jr. or Bob Custer and just leave it at that.

The two films presented on this ALPHA dvd are two of Jack's better outings, and I must say that they both look pretty good for public domain B-Westerns. I felt that both video and audio were above average and that actual film damage was minor with only a few splices or jump-cuts. The visual image for both films was better than acceptable.

In the first, WILDCAT SAUNDERS(1935), Jack play a boxer who gets wholloped because he's out of shape. His manager thinks that Jack needs to get away from big city temptations and whisks our hero out west so can can re-train and get back into form. Of course Jacks immediately runs into a pretty girl and uncovers a jewel robbery. Tom London is the big galoot who keeps getting pounded by Jack in coyote/roadrunner fashion. A good enjoyable B-Western that does have some offensive racial humor, though it is ""Snowflake""'s quick thinking that actually saves the day.

In Wolf Riders(1935) Jack, as a child, is orphaned only to be raised by Chief Red Wolf who brings our hero up as a truthful, honorable man. When Jack reaches adulthood it's time to set things right. The always excellent George Chesebro plays badguy Al Pearce and old-timer Lafe McKee is the Indian Agent. Pretty Lillian Gilmore is the romantic interest. This is the more serious of the two films and I liked it the best, though they were both pretty good.

Like I noted, the ALPHA dvd presents two really good looking Jack Perrin films at a super price. Let's face it, you just don't find this kind of stuff around much anymore. ALPHA is the only company I know of that constantly puts out tons of B-Westerns and other obscure poverty row features on a regular basis. And no, these films aren't restored to the digital quality of CITIZEN KANE or KING KONG, but they are actually there, these lost, low budget forgotten gems for fans of such stuff to finally get an opportunity to see and enjoy... And that's important.",1332633600,2,2473,4.600907029478458
