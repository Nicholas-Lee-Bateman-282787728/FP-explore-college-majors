2325314,5,B0009VND0E,"I first saw Head On at a small International film festival shortly after it's theatrical release, and fell in love with it almost immediately! This is by far the best move if the year, and a strong contender for my top 5 movies of all time. It's wide ranging appeal, from the intellectual international crowd who will drool over the interpersonal relationships of the Turkish-German main characters and the cultural aspects of two young, and slightly twisted people dealing with their overly traditional families, to a younger crowd who can appreciate this movie as simply a rocking kick-in-the-pants punk love story, I'm convinced that nearly everyone who sees this movie will love it!! 5 Stars, would give it more if I could! And let's not forget a shout out to Sybel Kekilli, who is one of the most beautiful women on the planet!",1126742400,36,832,4.825174825174825
2325315,5,B0009VND0E,"'Head-On' tells the story of Cahit and Sibel and never has a love story started in a more desperate place.  They  meet at a hospital shortly after he's driven his car into a wall and she's tried to kill herself.  It's obvious to both that they have something in common and yet, to begin with, both are so utterly self absorbed, they can only see each other as ways out of their own personal hells.  It's Cahit who realizes first that they might mean more to one another than this, but it's the progress of their relationship, filled with equal doses of love and hate and self destruction, that keeps the viewer gripped.  'Head on' is filled with a sense of poignant isolation, both personal and political, exiles who are destined not to fit into either their adopted or native cultures.  But it's a rare film that can depict such dry politics in such a moving and human manner.  For me, this was the best film of 2004.",1125446400,5,918,4.428571428571429
2325316,5,B0009VND0E,"""HEAD-ON"" (Gegen die Wand) describes ""The clash of civilizations"" (Samuel Huntington) with the pattern of a ROMEO-and-JULIA-story: a ROMEO (""Cahit Tomruk"" played by Birol Uenel) and JULIA (""Sibel Guner"" played by Sibel Kekilli), influenced by the circumstances of our present age, are suffering under their identity-pain, caught in their specific story of woe: the differences between German and Turkish culture, between living in the red-light-area of big cities (Hamburg, Berlin, Istanbul), however born in small rural villages, tattered between disciplined middle class, drunken underdogs or fundamental islamic believers beyond all social classes. In the beginning Romeo and Julia are in the protecting arms of a psychiatric hospital. But Cahit and Sibel prefer to break out and unteachably they return to their red-light-districts. Back in their life of drugs and suicide, violence and one-night-stands there is a climax, that will render Romeo into a phase of heavy jealousy: He kills an admirer of his Sibel-Julia. Now he is in prison - and Sibel-Julia leaves Germany and escapes to Istanbul. At first in the helping hands of her middle-class sister (a hotel manager), Sibel again (the actress Kekilli is a former porn-star and plays it well) carries on her run-away-identity: back to the entertaining whiskey-bar harbour-area of Istanbul - not an inch better than the german Hamburg Reeperbahn-scene: drugs, sex, self-suicidal violence. Her Romeo, after his prison time, speeds via taxi to Istanbul - only to find his Julia deeply changed in a masquerade of middle class behaviour: no long hairs, intellectual glasses, no emotions, with a hidden, frozen soul, married to a middle class man. What he wished to find had gone. So he mournfully leaves Istanbul and crawls back into his very roots: a little turkish town, where once he was born. An odyssee of finding oneself, though irreparable splitted up in the ""clash of civilizations"" ...",1121817600,3,1946,5.342019543973941
2325317,4,B0009VND0E,"Always an intoxicating feast for the senses, and at times downright shocking, Head On is quite a departure for Germany's up-and-coming Turkish director Faith Akin.  Previously known for kitsch comedies (Im Juli/In July) and touching dramadies (Solino), Akin plunges into his first overwhelmingly dark picture with reckless abandon - and it pays off.  If ever there was a film that demanded attention, even from those normally wary of reading at the cinema, this is it.

Head On is a suprisingly beautiful portrait of unconventional love, and it's two leads amaze at every increasingly unbelieveable turn.  Birol Unel, who generally plays grizzled thugs, plays... a grizzled thug, but lends his transition into a grizzled thug with a heart incredible believeability and sentiment, as he falls in love with newcomer Sibel Kelkilli's wildly suicidal character.  Kelkilli, a former porn star (a fact that didn't come out until Head On was on the festival circuit), handles the film's sexually charged scenes like a pro, unsurprisingly, but it's Unel who surprises most by turning his unattractive character into something pleasantly sexual.

Akin, a DJ before he turned to filmmaking, infuses this film, like all his previous films, with a tantilising and toe-tapping punk-electronica soundtrack, seemlessly fusing narrative action with music unlike any other director of the indie-pop generation.  The performances, the music and the surprising beauty of the love story creep up on you, making Head On a must-see for anyone who can stomach a bit of sex and violence for the ultimate movie-going payoff - cinematic AND emotional satisfaction.

One key warning: the scenes of sex and violence (particularly the violence) are VERY graphic.  Take this into consideration if you're particularly squeamish.",1120694400,15,1797,5.412186379928316

It is subtitled- but it isn't hard to follow at all.

The only thing that is hard to keep up with is the drastic time changes that the movie goes trough- it isn't hard to catch on, though. The director tries to makes it easier for you through Sibel's changing style.

It's one of my new favorite movies.",1120435200,3,501,4.040404040404041

It took you on a journey and let you know within the first 10 minutes what exactly what being put ""head on"". The film did lack character development, but it was not hard to put two and two together or draw from context clues. Regardless, this movie left you rooting for Cahit and Sibel, hoping that someday they will have their happy ending. But probably not.

Suddenly at the end of the film the two main characters have sort of found their way.  They are different people.  FIne, that's great, but what was in their history that made them so self-destructive in the first place?  If it was love that turned their lives around, then it was not communicated very well at all.  The film is also described as erotic.

Maybe my idea of love is old fashioned but definately must include, trust, understanding and a strong affection and personal attachment.

A woman wanting to escape her family, and a man trying to drown his sorrow accepts a proposal of a non-personal marriage from the woman.  His heart turns to love, but her heart turns inward toward her self.  Self is her only primal force, from beginning to end. It was a waste of my time.

2325411,5,B0009VND0E,"One of my favorite movies of recent years. Amazingly moving, bleak, sexy, funny, punky. Great acting, wonderful, simple photography, cool editing choices, and terrific music.

An alcoholic, self-destructive Turk living in Germany agrees to marry young, borderline crazy, free spirited Turkish girl looking to get away from her grasping, tradition bound family. This simple plot leads to a relationship of amazing complexity, and a love story of joy, humor, and heartbreak.  That's partly because filmmaker Akin approaches familiar situations with such a unique, playful and fresh eye, and partly because, along with his two lead actors he has created two unforgettable characters - rich in contradictions and confusion, like all of us.

Nothing in their obvious personal experience is anything like mine.  I've never been an immigrant, an alcoholic, or lost and self-destructive.  Yet, with amazing ease I felt let into this world, and found the human connections underneath, the things we all share.  Suddenly the differences in the human experience seemed much less important than the similarities.  And, to me, this is the real genius Akin has shown in his last few films.  By being so specific and real about a world, he, paradoxically makes it universal and accessible.

I urge you to seek it out.",1275955200,6,1302,5.251207729468599

2325415,4,B0009VND0E,"This fierce drama about the doomed love of two Turkish immigrants in Germany looks like an Ottoman remake of Sid and Nancy. Punctuated by the songs of a female singer and her band in Istanbul, it tells the story of Cahit (Birol Unel) a middle aged drunk and widower who has just attempted suicide by crashing his car into a wall head on (hence the title). In a hospital ward in Hamburg he meets the twenty one years old Sibel (nicely performed by porn actress Sibel Kekilli), and they soon agree to a fake, sexless marriage in order that she can escape her conservative family. While they both initially agree that this will be a marriage of convenience, hot tempered Cahit will eventually be unable to stand the jealousy caused by Sibel's promiscuous life.

The director/writer uses characters who may be bi-polar to accentuate the differnces between our Western culture and the Near Islamic East. This turns into one of the most beautiful tugs of war ever portrayed on film. This film has made me appreciate the Turkish culture and Turkey as the place where ""East Meets West"".",1184630400,,377,4.8
2325418,5,B0009VND0E,"Great film, pity amazon didn't leave us much to say about it after their review but hear goes.

Wouldnt realy describe it a 'punk rock' apart from Cahits vague connection with punk music this is a great little insight into life of Turks in Germany.  Two people both going their own way in life come together by chance but both have more baggage than they originally thought.

Cahit with his sadly passed away wife who he still morns and Sibel with her 'conservative' family who are filled with their own contradictions (My favorite scene is when Cahit is playing cards with Sibels brother and a few others, while they are sitting chatting about how they sleep with prostitutes behind their wives backs and the pros and cons of various women of differing nationalities Cahit shouts out ""why don't you go and f*** your own wives?  Sibels brother of course is outraged at intimacy between him and his wife being discussed)

As their marriage of convenience spirals out of control with Sibel continuing to sleep around and Cahit begining more and more to feel something for her it comes to a horrific conclusion resulting in Cahit being jailed and Sibel returning to Turkey.

Some wonderful scenes in Turkey such as when Sibel goes into a cafe and sits next to two young men chatting amongst themselves; first there is the shock from the both of them that she should come and sit next to a strange man then her question ""You know where I can get any drugs""  Their reply ""Are you mad or something girl""  Just sums up the cultural gulf between Sibels hedonistic life in Germany and even the most secular of Turks who still leads a reasonably respectable life.

There is just so much that this film captures of life both in Germany and Turkey of young people living there and the contradictions they encounter.

Recomended film.

By the way; its called ""Against the Wall"" In Turkish.  In my opinion a far better title than ""Head On""",1183420800,3,1925,4.646017699115045
2325419,4,B0009VND0E,"Am I the only Turk who has reviewed this film? I surely hope not. It has taken me ages to finally rent this. I am extremely depressed right now but it was well worth it. Please, don't classify this as a German movie. Let this be a Turkish movie. It was nicely done, a bit predictable at times but no big deal. The acting was above expectations. As for the story line, believable enough. I found it ironic that the heroine Sibel needs to marry a Turkish guy in order to get peace from her family according to the plot (which is very believable, mind you) but that in reality she used to be a porn star before this film.

As a minor negative, the Turkish being spoken was whiny and got on my nerves quite a bit. To their defense, I have been away from my precious homeland for almost 10 years now and for all I know, this could be the way modern Turkish is being spoken right now.",1179619200,2,878,4.1345029239766085
2325420,4,B0009VND0E,"This minimalist picture has to do with a delicate state of things around the figure of the immigrant into a new universe, absolutely unknown. Two lonely human beings besieged by their inner demons and the ineffable trace of his condition of exiled, permeates and defines several aspects to be taken intro account. The necessity of living and be loved increases in both of them; but with distinct rate speed. He is widow, but she tries to escape from her particular familiar hell, and searches in the marriage a device to emancipate herself once for all.

They will meet in an institution, and the fixed idea of be married really scares this lonely man, who begins to doubt about that issue. The frame is done because at last her dreams come true, and so she will know the delights and penuries of this relationship, which was born from her imagination to idealize a blue prince1 but the initial encounter with that huddled home will be the beginning of an agreement between them, there will be no sex and will live in different rooms.

But as you and me will guess the love will make its inevitable triumphal appearance, against the odds.

A curious melodrama that certainly rides between the nostalgia and the humor; trying to get an exit door into an overwhelming world.",1176854400,,1272,4.7207207207207205
2325431,4,B0009VND0E,"I am not Turkish, but I am one of those in-between people like the protagonists (living with two cultures, immigrant child of immigrants), so something rang very true here when I watched Sibel rebel against the constraints of a tradition that was more caging of women than men and more sexually guarded than the culture at large (it was similar in my Cuban upbringing).

Unlike Sibel, I wasn't self-destructive and, frankly, unhinged.

But the reason this story is so intriguing is because both leads, Sibel and Cahit, are people on a path toward death--he drinks to excess and attempts suicide via head-on collision with a wall. She slices up her arms and takes drugs, the biggest drug being one-night stands with men she hooks up with in bars or, well, wherever.

They're both a mess, and it's painful and repulsive and fascinating to see them just make incredibly stupid, desperate decisions.

Cahit and Sibel meet at a mental hospital (both after suicide attempts). She is a scrawny, wild-haired, but strangely mesmerizing woman; he is a spaced-out slob stuck in some dark groove. We see her light dimmed in her family's presence. We see her family suffering over her crazy acting out. And we see and understand why she sees this disheveled and suicidal and barely coherent drunk as her way out. They marry because what else can be done? That's how they see it. He has nothing better to do. She sees this as her only out from a repressive home environment. The director is savvy and sensitive enough not to paint the parents as tyrants squashing Sibel's spirit. We see they do love her, and we see that from their perspective, their way is right, and she is wrapped up in evil and shamefulness. They are not wholly wrong. She is not behaving maturely or thoughtfully or smartly. She really is acting like an immature, selfish, whacked out sex addict.

The film lets us see the awfulness of Cahit and Sibel's situations, but we also see moments when their better natures shine through. As Cahit begins to actually fall in love with this woman who is wife in name only, who sleeps with other men and comes home with the dawn. We see him value the touches she brings--a tidier home, fresh Turkish meals she learned from her mother, just laughing together, dancing together. He begins to reengage with life. Sibel, however, is setting up a flashpoint situation.

And everything will change with an act that is both understandable and criminal.

The movie then takes a new turn, and we find ourselves in Turkey, where we know a stricken Sibel will either turn over a new leaf or meet her demise.

And Cahit will find that his destiny is more and yet less than what he imagined.

There are moments in the film where we cut to a scene of a turkish band (all male) and a female singer performing on the shore of some body of water--the Bosphorus?--with Istanbul visible across the river and the Haggia Sophia quite prominent. It's an interesting device that keeps us locked into a sense of another culture. The here (Germany) and there (Turkey), and that span of separation (the river)...all immigrants understand that metaphor.

The two lead actors are rivetting. I've never seen them before, but the woman who plays Sibel has such intensity in her eyes, and she can look horribly unappealing or amazingly sexy depending on how she brightens or dims. The actor who plays Cahit has this same ability--he can be repulsive or appealing depending on a shift of expression, a change in the eyes or posture. They both vividly portray obsession and depression and living on the edge of destruction or salvation.

It's a difficult film to watch, because deep human pain and stupidity are hard to watch without feeling superior at one moment, ashamed at another, compassionate another, and helpless another. You sympathize with nearly ALL the characters, who are in their way each trapped by desires and expectations and not fitting into some mold--whether it's the brother of Sibel, Sibel, Cahit, or Cahit's ""uncle"", or Sibel's mother and father...

The message, life is hard, but you can make it harder or easier on yourself. And love, love is powerful, love is resurrecting, love can give you hope and fill you with life again, but love can also be something elusive and short-lived and, always, surprising.

This film is not for a day you want to be cheerful. It's for a day when you're not afraid to see broken humanity and maybe commisserate and pray.",1173571200,9,4445,4.772135416666667
2325432,4,B0009VND0E,"There's a key scene early in Fatih Akin's raw and beautiful ""Head-On"" in which a psychiatrist quotes a lyric by the English band ""The The"".  The song he quotes from (the aptly titled ""Lonely Planet"") is a lesser-known track on the same album as one of that band's more familiar hits, ""Love Is Stronger Than Death."" And I can't help but feel that this latter song was an inspiration for this movie, as it's the central theme of the film.  Amidst all the flashy cinematography and the edgy intensity, at its heart this movie is simply about the healing (and, yes, destructive, but most often life-affirming) power of love.

And that healing power is especially necessary in the lives of Cahit Tomruk (Birol Unel, in a gritty and real performance) and Sibel Guner (the radiantly exquisite Sibel Kekilli), who meet in a psych ward after attempting to kill themselves.  Later in the above-mentioned scene, the psychiatrist tells Tomruk, ""If you want to end your life, end it.  But you don't have to die to do that.  End your life here and go somewhere else.  Do something useful.""

It is this meeting that sets the stage for Tomruk's turnaround - a man who had given up all hope now opens up just enough to take a chance on some kind of future, a future that arrives in the form of Sibel's unexpected marriage proposal.  And from there (and throughout the movie) there are many scenes that bring to visual and visceral life yet another lyric: ""Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.""  i.e. these characters, who so recently had nothing, are newly emboldened in their actions because there's nowhere to go but up.

If it seems like I'm waxing overly-lyrically about this film, it might be due to the prominent role that music plays in it.  The director inserts alternating, palate-cleansing riverside performances of Traditional Turkish music regularly (and entertainingly) into the narrative.  And one of my favorite moments is when Cahit sits at a piano, idly playing a repetitive bass line - except the song he's playing is not so accidental: it's a song called ""Life's What You Make It"" (later reprised as a full-on version in the closing credits).

This kind of deft and clever use of music becomes an additional narrative unto itself, the music playing yet another character.  And from punk to rock to pop to traditional (all in many languages), the filmmaker's use of music is always pitch-perfect for the scene and usually has the auxiliary effect of a Greek Chorus commenting on what's happening in the movie at that particular time.

Sometimes disturbing but ultimately affirming, ""Head-On"" manages to find beauty in some of humanity's darkest corners.

As for the extras on this DVD.. even the 29 minute ""Making of Head-On"" bonus feature (entitled ""Report of an Intern"") begins with a musical montage, set to a song that builds from Turkish folk to punk.  The intern in question, Harry, has some very funny insights and revealing anecdotes about the actors and the making of the film (regarding Birol Unel, for example: ""sometimes he scares me, but he takes his work very seriously"").  Harry also recounts how Unel almost wasn't allowed into Turkey to finish shooting the film.  There's also some great footage of the filming of the car crash scene and the riverside musical numbers with the Selim Sesler band.

The outtakes are kind of disjointed and not very amusing, but some of the deleted scenes are quite comedic and others are surprisingly poignant - all are worth watching (although one can see why they were deleted as they would generally detract or be incidental to the overall tone of the film).",1169251200,,3627,4.827140549273021
2325433,4,B0009VND0E,"This is one of those films that neither of us knows how it got into our queue. It turned out to be pretty good, though. If you have any squick for cutting, this is not your film. Otherwise it is fairly tame and a very realistic love story, once you cut through the semantics surrounding it. It was also a lovely film, typical German high art and cinematography. I really enjoyed being exposed to new actors (literally in some cases).",1165363200,,433,4.425
2325434,4,B0009VND0E,"`Head-On' is about a love story, but the love described here is a full-blown torrent of raw emotion. The words you listen to are those of punk rock songs, and the tensions are often frightening, especially in the first half. You may or may not like this film, but no one can deny its tremendous and genuine energy.

The story begins in Hamburg, Germany. Alcoholic Cahit meets Sibel in a hospital after his attempted suicide. Sibel, a German Turk, asks Cahit who is also from Turkey to marry her in order to get out of her home of her Muslin parents, and live more freely. In return, she will clean up his room and even pay the rent. Cahit declines at first, but reconsiders later, and accepts her offer, pretending that he is truly in love with her before her family.

It is a plausible story and the director says it is part based on his own experience. Whatever the origin of the story is, the emotional roller coaster of the ever-changing relations between Cahit and Sibel is unpredictable. Whether or not they fall in love with each other is not a big question because it is already suggested in semi-musical sequences that open up each chapter of the story. More gripping and absorbing part is how these two self-destructive persons deal with their own demon and face it. And in this film, their demon happens to be the love for each other.

The film's narrative is not a very refined one, and the outburst of characters' emotions is sometimes represented by graphic violence, which would make some viewers uncomfortable. As in French film `Betty Blue,' we are always aware of the tragic tone, and two leads Birol nel and Sibel Kekilli successfully generate the unnerving tension that keeps rising. In a sense they are not acting out the parts. They are the characters themselves.

Not many people would choose to watch `Head-On', and even if they do, some of them would heartily hate it. And perhaps we are not watching the complete version of the film which looks shorter than it should (if there is, somebody must release it). However, though story of passionate love is nothing new, it is seldom expressed with such power and intensity.",1158710400,2,2145,4.666666666666667
2325435,4,B0009VND0E,"""Head-On"" is an intriguing film about two Turkish immigrants trying to forge a strange sort of life together in Hamburg, Germany.  Cahit and Sibel meet in a mental hospital where they are both receiving treatment for failed suicide attempts.  Sibel is so desperate to get out from under her oppressive, tradition-bound family that she pleads with Cahit - whom she barely knows and who is nearly twenty years her senior - to enter into a sham marriage with her.  Reluctantly, he agrees, much to the consternation of her family who, while consenting to the marriage, make it clear to Sibel that she could do much better.  After the two move in together, Cahit is at first happy to keep Sibel at arm's length while the girl sleeps around with various younger guys in the neighborhood.  Gradually, however, Cahit's indifference turns to obsession as he realizes that he himself is falling in love with Sibel.  From thereon in the relationship becomes ever more complicated until, finally, events spin so far out of control that the two wind up going along paths they never could have imagined when they started.

This German/Turkish co-production sets its tale of an impossible love against the backdrop of two clashing cultures.  Though they are certainly both products of Eastern society, Cahit and Sibel have clearly adopted many of the ways of the democratized West.  Cahit often scoffs at his Turkish upbringing and Sibel does just about everything she can to not be a model daughter and sister for her stultified family.  The relationship between Cahit and Sibel is an amazingly complex and volatile one; on the one hand, they seem to be genuinely drawn to one another out of a sense of love and commitment, while, on the other, they are co-dependent in ways that wind up bringing harm to them both as individuals and as a couple.  Yet, for all their problems together, we do sense that Sibel really does bring meaning to Cahit`s existence (as he claims), and that he may well serve the same function for her, as what starts out as a relationship of convenience turns into so much more.  Writer/director Fatih Akin does not provide us with easy reference points for how to deal with these characters, and it is that very complexity and ambiguity that makes their story fascinating.

Birol Unel is excellent as Cahit, the man who has hit such a low place at the beginning of the film that anything is bound to look like up from there.  But it is Sibel Kekilli, as Sibel, who really shines in the film.  Stunningly beautiful throughout, she radiates an astonishing chemistry from the screen that catches our eye like a laser beam and never lets go.  She alone is worth the price of admission.",1154908800,4,2692,4.769396551724138

It was a much better film than I expected. I was quite smitten with the lead actress who is the flawed, fractured essence at the center of this story, Sibel. Equally powerful and at once both compelling and repulsive is the husband, Cahit. These mismatched people are doomed to break apart from the beginning, but first they must come together. That, in effect, is what this movie is about. The growth of the spirit, the growth of love and compassion, and the growth of the awareness that life requires more from us than anger and bitterness regardless of how we may feel justified in these emotions. It's not a film for the faint of heart. There are scenes of brutality and violence that may disturb some viewers. The last scene is a bit of a cliche having been used in movies for at least sixty years.

For one, a ""dip"" in the pool is no where NEAR forbidden in most peoples ideology who hail from turkey.  If you knew much turkey you would be able to recognize their liberal nature, and thus, there atypical behavior of mostly islamic nations.

Second,  you try to make turkey sound very influenced by religion.  This, is again, entirely untrue...especially being that turkey is a secular country and therefore any overly zealous religious tendencies would come from personal attributions.

i could go on to rip apart your review...but i'll leave it there and get to the film.

this is a beautiful movie to say the least.  the portrayel of human suffering, happiness, and culture is depicted wonderfully through out the entire film.

Although the film is a bit dark and not for the light hearted, it is safe to be said that this is, in fact, where the real beauty of the film originates.  love from a dark place is mystical in this film...and it leaves you wondering in the end...maybe even a bit unsatisfied with the outcome- who knows.

2325440,5,B0009VND0E,"For viewers of Hollywood films about marriages of convenience that turn into romantic comedies, this is not another one of those. Which is not to say that the kind of romance that develops between the two central characters doesn't have far reaching effects - living happily together ever after not being among them. Each in his way is redeemed by love, and the viewer is taken along on a long, long journey with many turns, often difficult to absorb. If anything, the film represents the painful conflict at the heart of many Turks living as expatriates in Europe.

The ""head-on"" car crash that brings the two protagonists together is also about a whiplash collision of cultures that are not only separated by a great distance but also by centuries. It is not surprising that in these circumstances both characters are driven to extremes of behavior. That Cahit and Sibel survive the ordeals they have gone through is partly the result of what they begin to feel for each other, but also important is a return to Turkey where each finds some measure of personal integrity.

The performances in this film are breathtaking. Birol ?nel as Cahit is a Turkish Klaus Kinski with the mercurial ""good looks"" of Mick Jagger. He is a stormy presence on the screen (and apparently on the set as well) and delivers a disturbing portrayal of self-destructiveness. Sibel Kekilli's peformance is equally astonishing.

2325452,4,B0009VND0E,"'Gegen die Wand' in German, 'Duvara karsi' in Turkish, or 'HEAD-ON' in English is an explosive drama written and directed by Fatih Akin, a movie that may be tough to watch, but a movie that has enormous impact.  While other films have successfully addressed the particular problems that the immigrant Turkish community in Germany face, few have come as close to examining all sides of the on-going issues of displacement and the effects of familial dispersal in the face of a new culture.

Cahit (Birol nel) is a thirty-something lost soul, drinking and snorting himself into oblivion over the loss of his beloved wife.  He lives in a slum, spends all his time in sleazy bars getting beaten up for inappropriate behavior until one night he drunkenly drives into a wall (?suicidal?) and ends up in a hospital where he 'meets' Sibel (Sibel Kekilli), a young woman who has again attempted suicide as an escape from her strict family's prevention of her having a life.  Hearing Cahit is Turkish, Sibel nonchalantly suggests they 'marry': Sibel's only way to escape her family would be to find a Turkish husband.  Though grossly mismatched, the two agree to an 'open marriage', they satisfy Sibel's family, and move in together.  Sibel cooks and cleans Cahit's hovel, and then goes out and sleeps around.  This arrangement eventually causes problems for each of them and Sibel moves to Istanbul to escape the horrors of the life she has chosen.  Once alone, Cahit is confronted with the reality that Sibel is the only path to salvation for his tragic life and the story proceeds - or rather speed drives - its way to a heartrending finish.

The characters in the film are generally unlikable sorts, especially Cahit, but each actor does so well allowing us to observe the dreary world that faces immigrants in a fractured society that we end up having an amazing amount of compassion for their character creations.  Director Akin makes this two-hour plus drama speed by with such solid purpose that it seems a short film.  There is considerable nudity and the sexual encounters may be a problem for some viewers, but Akin's cinematographer Rainer Klausmann  makes everything work toward the ultimate message of the film. An interesting touch is Akin's choice of weaving a chamber music group of a female vocalist with Turkish instrumentalists as a chorus to comment on the action and keep us mindful that, though the film for the most part is set in Germany, this is a very Turkish story!

Cahit (Birol nel) is a disheveled (drug-sniffing) middle-aged Turkish-German, tethering on the fringes of sane behavior. Under the influence of drugs and gallons of alcohol he crashes his car into a wall and lands up into a hospital/psychiatric ward. Surprisingly, he gets away with a neck band and a limp. He runs into Sibel (Sibel Kekilli) who is struggling from identity crisis, marriage-hungry parents and family bonds. Sibel has an obsession to slash her wrists (mostly to prove her point and probably a way of stress-relief). Sibel kick starts the conversation by asking Cahit to marry her (because he is Turkish just like her). Cahit wards off her advances, but Sibel persists with her efforts and advances. However, her greater plan is to lead a carefree promiscuous life under the alibi of a marriage. She does manage to convince Cahit, who (unwillingly) has to shave his unkempt beard to visit Sibel's parents. After a bit of struggle, Cahit and Sibel manage to get married. However, this is an unconventional marriage and Sibel unleashes her hedonistic side filled with debauchery. Cahit, straightens up a little, but has spikes of aggressive and violent behavior. Sibel and Cahit continue to lead their own separate lives under the guise of their marriage.

However, slowly a bond starts to develop between the two and Cahit starts caring for Sibel. In a twist, Cahit runs into a slanger passing rude remarks about Sibel and he responds by rendering a fatal blow. Cahit gets a prison term and Sibel runs away to Istanbul to escape her seething parents. In Istanbul, Sibel has to do housekeeping chores to run a living and she starts getting pangs of identity crisis yet again. She responds by resorting to her promiscuous ways and indluging in drugs and alcohol. She runs into some street urchins who stab her over a minor squabble. She gets rescued by a taxi-driver. A couple of years pass and Cahit completes his prison term and rushes to Istanbul to seek Sibel (he now has a reason to lead a sane life). However, Sibel in the meantime has settled down with her resucuer and has a cute little daughter. Cahit manages to locate Sibel and both of them passionately want to start over with their relationship.

Cahit and Sibel plan to meet at a bus station and run away to start afresh. Sibel packs her bags, but cannot convince herself to leave her cute little daughter. Cahit expectantly waits for her in the bus, but Sibel doesn't come. The bus starts its pushback during the twilight hours and head out with Cahit alone. This climax scene is very poignant and has been executed beautifully (and in my opinion the best scene in the entire picture).",1131148800,2,2788,4.828451882845188
