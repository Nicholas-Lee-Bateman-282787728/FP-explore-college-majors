2194865,5,B0006TPDKC,"Young kids will love these adorable characters and parents will appreciate the good clean humor in this animated tale.  This DVD contains 2 catchy episodes:

Episode 1 - Fear of Flying, helps kids address their fears along with teaching them that making fun of others is not a good thing to do.

Episode 2 - Garden Variety Problem, shows the importance of planning, sticking to your word, the importance of work and even eating healthy.  A good lesson for parents too!",1172361600,3,468,4.7407407407407405

2194869,5,B0006TPDKC,"In a style similar to the Hermie videos ""The Pond"" is a huge hit with my kids ages two, four and six. There is some humor a little over my six year olds head but that is what keeps me watching it with them. Still my two oldest have memorized just about every line in particular the opening with all the FBI, CIA, FDA etc. warnings!!!! Nice story with the usual teachings of values integrity and so on. They are asking for another one!!!",1143504000,8,436,4.2023809523809526

8043100,5,B0006TPDKC,My wife and I loved it as much as our 2 and 4 yr old boys.  We saw more silly and political humor in it than they did (as is usually the case for kidss  cartons).  It isn't the best Pond video but my boys still really like it and want to watch it often.,1408665600,,253,3.5636363636363635
8043101,3,B0006TPDKC,Once I put it on they seem to enjoy it but if they have the choice they always ask to watch something else. I enjoyed it but I think the humor is a little over their heads. Like the morals and the songs but won't by anymore of the DVDs.,1392336000,,236,3.74

8043104,4,B0006TPDKC,"I gave this as a gift to children ages 4 and 6.  Their mother said they liked it and that she thought it was a ""cute"" story.  I would have given it 5 stars if she would have said they want to watch it over and over.",1173312000,,215,3.5531914893617023
