2329893,4,B0009WSO7K,"Excellent story line.  Very captivating.  This is one of the best drama series I have ever seen.  The only reason I did not rate it a 5 was due to the English sub-titles being somewhat hard to understand.  But I realize it is difficult to get a good dynamic equivalent translation sometimes. Congratulations to the producers, cast and crew of the excellent Korean Drama series. I also have Vol 1 and 2 and really enjoyed them.",1180656000,3,426,4.565789473684211

With complex setups, nearly a dozen richly defined characters, and timescale spanning 50 years, bringing a satisfying conclusion to Dae Jang Geum seems all but impossible. To compound the challenge, the creators elected to stretch the series with additional episodes. Although not without problems, the result is impressive.

To satisfy such lofty goals, Dae Jang Geum ends with 3 successive conclusions. The first and most satisfying conclusion is the resolution of Lady Choi's misdeeds. It happens quickly and all the loose ends are tied. Nearly 40 years of struggle finally comes to an end. Then the second one begins, tying the romance between Jang Geum and Jung Ho. Their conclusion is not nearly as satisfying as the first but succeeds with several beautiful and noteworthy scenes. The final conclusion is a mess, but as the end credit rolled, I was still very much satisfied and impressed by its ambitious scope.

Dae Jang Geum volume 3 contains the final 18 episodes, from 37 to 54. As a bonus, a small photo gallery is included. As I mentioned in my volume 1 review, I would've liked to see inclusion of background information. Although not crucial, some understanding of Chosun history and Korean culture can enhance the viewing experience (articles in Wikipedia can be of some help). And considering all the hard work, I would've loved to see behind-the-scenes footage. Fortunately, video websites such as YouTube have some of these supplemental materials (search for ""Dae Jang Geum"").

Episodes 37 and 38 pick up where volume 2 left up, with very satisfying end to the mother queen incident. A new villain emerges (Yul-Yi), perhaps even nastier than 3 Chois put together. Episodes 39 through 42 deal with 3rd and final prophecy (which was presented on the first episode). Episodes 43 through 48 start and end with highly satisfying roller coaster ride to Lady Choi's resolution. Episodes 49 through 51 feature political aftershock, her best friend's labor, and further validation of the final prophecy. Episodes 52 and 53 feature Jang Geum's rise to high ranking officer, fate of Jang Geum and Jung Ho's relationship (with obligatory Korean love triangle arc), all leading up to the final conclusion on episode 54.

If I have to criticize the series, it would be the leisurely pacing of the epilogue. Throughout the series, flashbacks are used often and at generous portion. Still, as a movie critic Roger Ebert once wrote, I suppose ice cream is best savored slowly because it is so good. This is one TV drama sad to see it end. It was one exhaustive ride, but at all times, I was glued to the screen. My other criticism is all to near perfect nature of Jang Geum. Yes, she does have few flaws, mainly her lack of patience and being too curious. But she is just way too smart, way too kind, way too courageous, and way too beautiful. But I suppose we love her just the same. =) And finally, some of the medical practices are just too miraculous and over-the-top.

Technically speaking, both the costumes and set decorations are spot on. The makeup is uneven, however -- some of the characters have eyeliners on! And the frequent use of chef body double, the one with the stubby fingers, is a bit distracting. And because the series was shot using video cameras, the overall look is not as cinematic as US TV dramas.

With so much nuances and attention to details, this series demands a repeated viewing. Its themes are numerous and universal: perseverance, friendship, health, and how revenge and justice are not one in the same.",1167264000,27,3592,4.859477124183006
2329895,5,B0009WSO7K,"Forget everything you think you know about Chinese or Korean
historical dramas.  Dae Jang Geum is the best.  It broke all records in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Korea.  Tens of thousands of
people flock to the Dae Jang Geum theme park in Korea because they have been so moved by the mini-series.  For myself, I think of Jang Geum as my new role model, the kind of person I would like to emulate. Whatever you do, don't miss this drama. It's superb.",1138320000,20,443,4.365853658536586

This box set produced by YA entertainment for sale in the USA and Canada has flawless subtitles.  A woman of the 1500's korea (joseun dynasty) is mentioned in the annals of the korean dynasty.  Seems she was a physician to the king of Joseun.  She was the highest ranking woman and only female doctor to the king in korea's joseun history.  This drama is a fictitious tale based on this real person.  A orphan rises from the lowest member of society to a DAEGUM .. (great person) In a man only world of ancient confucian korea.

Behind her child-like eyes lies an ambitious working girl with a 21st century mindset. See how Jang Geum goes from being a virtually abandoned child to maid, to cook and than finally becoming the King's doctor. Which is unheard of as it was a male dominated profession at the time. This unforgettable drama of epic proportions tells the touching and tear-jerking story of a true underdog.
Volume 3  concludes the series  ""Jewel in the Palace"" is based on a True Story about a legendary girl (Jang-Geum) who after much struggle and heartbreak became the first woman of the Chosun Dynasty to be the supreme royal physician.

8068687,1,B0009WSO7K,"Other reviewers have written all kinds of good things about this great historical korean drama. The series was well made and almost excellent in every aspect. I bought all three volumes almost two years ago and really enjoyed watching them time and again. Of course, it deserves more than one star but who would read my review if I give it five like most of the others.

After almost two years of waiting nobody has written anything about the big time blooper that they made in making this series. Let me point it out to anybody who is interested. Go and watch the last few episodes in Volume 3 where Jang Geum's raising her young daughter. Look at the daughter's face carefully and try to remember it.....Then you have to go back to Volume 1 and watch Episodes 2 through 4 when the child Jang Geum (7-10 years old) first entered the palace as a new young bride. Look at all her classmates/roommates in many scenes and you will find her future daughter among them. In some scenes she is actually almost next to her future mother.

My point is....with all the seemingly attention to details that the director/producer and other crew members put into the making of a very good series....why did they have to use the same child actress as her young classmate and then later on as her daughter? Did they run out of a qualified child to play the part of her daughter? Or is she related to the director or producer? Maybe they all gambled that nobody will notice such 'trivial' but embarrassing public blunder.

Well, if nothing else, I just hope I added an extra incentive for anybody who loves the series to watch it again....Have fun and enjoy the whole thing all over again...BIG TIME BLOOPER included.

And if you don't have the three volumes yet, I recommend getting them to enjoy every moment of watching a future classic.",1218240000,2,1823,4.58282208588957

8068689,5,B0009WSO7K,"The third volume introduces yet more trials for the brave and brilliant Jang Geum, but it also serves up a satisfying, but just, comeuppance for the villains.  Yet the quality of this drama is such that even Jang Geum's enemies have complex motivations and even tug a bit of sympathy out of us at the end.  What indeed would you have done if you'd been born a Choi?  By volume three, you understand why all of Asia was hooked on this series...but then I can't imagine how someone could stop watching without seeing this through to the finish.  Unlike the weaker seasons of Desperate Housewives or Sex and the City, you can't miss a disc of this one.  Do yourself a favor and buy all three volumes at once!",1192579200,5,705,4.434108527131783
