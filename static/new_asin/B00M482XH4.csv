________________________________________________________

The original 2005 Sin City was written and directed by Frank Miller alongside Robert Rodriguez that took the comic-book genre to a new level. With a technical palette and background in art, Miller created a world where comics come to life as the characters come out of the pages. In its run at the box-office the movie took in $158 million* world-wide; however, it has been nine years since wed see a sequel. This time around, Miller re-introduces characters from the last film and continues their stories in A Dame To Kill For as they are part of the second book in the series.

Four stories are introduced; including The Long Bad Night that sees Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) racketing up the cash by wining it big at the slots. It isn't until he meets Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) and beating him at his own game that leads Johnny to get attacked by Roarks men. Even Johnnys friend he meets at the casino is not safe at the hands of Roarks group as they kill her off, only for Johnny to find her dead at her place. It all comes down to one last confrontation with the Senator that Johnny hopes to shut him up for good.

Another story, A Dame To Kill For as the main feature of the film, sees Dwight (Josh Brolin) battle within himself, until he meets Ava (Eva Green) a woman Dwight cant resist. Her plight for safety sends Dwight to confront Avas abusive husband, that of Damien Lord (Marton Csokas), a self-made millionaire. But in a turn of events, its Ava that lusts for control and uses Dwight to get what she wants and to finally make off with her husbands riches. Dwight has to fend for himself and stop Ava before her devilish antics kills anyone else in her path.

Starting off with the aesthetics, Frank Miller brings the comics to life and is visually appealing. After watching the film in 3D, it does lend to the technology and helps bring the viewer into the comic realm. However, do you have to watch the movie in 3D to enjoy it without missing out on the extra dimension? Not really. There were some brutal scenes in the film, including an eye gouging by Mickey Rourkes Marv on Manute (Dennis Haysbert) that even the sound of it was hard to muster.

Where the film fails is in the transitions between the stories; especially when you have four stories to contend with. While two of them- A Dame To Kill For and The Long Bad Night- were the main attractions the others felt unnecessary and misplaced in the narrative. And something that could knock the film, but generally shouldnt, is continuity between this film and last. If you have not seen the first film it may be required for this viewing.

The movie is fun and different as Frank Miller does what he does best. His work in comics and being able to translate them from paper onto the big screen is commendable at best. Miller can bring the dark and twisted and make art out of it without a hitch. Although Sin City: A Dame To Kill For has its fun, there isn't a rush to watch it at the cinema as other films may be more fulfilling than this one.",1408752000,,3132,4.505281690140845
6554904,4,B00M482XH4,"Theatrical review.  Potential spoilers.  In 2005, I saw the first ""Sin City"" in theaters and gushed in a review that ""it was a fresh, unique and ground breaking (film) on many fronts.""  To be fair, that comment isn't necessarily true in this sequel.  Also to be fair, those looking for complicated plots, articulate banter and theatrical heft will be left wanting.

""Dame"" doesn't hide what it wants to be.  That is, a stylistic onslaught of visual mayhem, violence, sex and nudity...with just a touch of humor.  While this look of the graphic novel is spot on with the mostly black and white motif, it didn't catch on after the success of the original.  ""The Spirit"" (2008) tried to capture the look and style but failed at the box office.  Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller return with many of the same characters and a few new ones.

Mickey Rourke returns as Marv and becomes the link to the different story lines.  He's the unofficial protector of Nancy (Jessica Alba), evidently the only stripper at the club where everyone hangs out.  And apparently as sexy as Nancy is, she never strips either.  Her original guardian, Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is but a ghost of his former self.  But she's out for revenge, as is just about everybody, against Senator Roark (terrifically nasty Powers Boothe).  Even Roark's illegitimate son, Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who beats his old man at cards and plays a price.  I like this new character and would like to have seem more.

Josh Brolin is new but his character, Dwight, is not.  He replaces Clive Owen in the role.  The centerpiece in the story and the ""dame to kill for"" is Ava (Eva Green) who had Dwight eating out of her hand years earlier.  It made him crazy so he does his best to clean up his act and stay away.  But she doesn't.  In a terrific scene she meets him at the strip club.  She walks in and everything around her is black and white except for her vibrant blue trench coat.  That's just about the last thing she wears in the movie.  It's no wonder she has men wanting to die for her.  The elderly couple in the theater I was in couldn't take a screen full of bosoms and promptly walked out as younger teens sneaked in.

The film ups the violence quotient to boot.  Blood, usually white or red, is everywhere as heads are severed, eyes gouged out and fingers broken.  The film is a visual feast with beautifully created scenes and a look that improves on the original.  As I said at the beginning it may not have the gravitas and freshness of the original but damn, Eva Green is to die for.",1408752000,87,2554,4.525164113785558
6554905,3,B00M482XH4,"Just how good of a year was 2005 for comic book movies? You basically had two groundbreaking films that turned the entire genre on its side opening within two months of each other: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and Robert Rodriguez's Sin City. Nobody disputes the impact of Nolan's trilogy but it can be argued Sin City, with its sleazy cast of hard-edged film noir archetypes and visuals literally popping from the pages of Frank Miller's graphic novel, was more immediately impressive. Copycats followed and Rodriguez's use of CGI technology became the new standard for by which all such films were measured. There just weren't any more Sin City flicks, at least not right away. Nine years later, after much teasing by Rodriguez, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is finally here and it offers sexier femme fatales, more angry antiheroes, more blood and nudity. And while that may be enough to satisfy the most hardcore fans others may feel like the long wait was barely worth it.

The genius of Sin City and its pair of adaptations, co-directed by Rodriguez and Miller, is that it resembles the nasty criminal underworld of Batman comics with the hyper-stylization of superheroes. It's a place where a crazed behemoth like Marv (Mickey Rourke) can get shot a dozen times and come back to pluck a guy's eye out, grumbling one-liners the whole way. Rodriguez doesn't so much as recreate the familiar film noir elements; dark shadows, cigarette smoke, vigilantes and manipulative vixens; he glorifies them while indulging in the comical violence he's always been such a fan of. In this case, the maddeningly over-the-top violence more closely resembles that of Rodriguez's Machete Kills, which couldn't be less of a film noir than Spy Kids was.

Rodriguez's computer generated backgrounds, which blew our minds nine years ago, no longer have that element of surprise but they are still breathtaking to behold. Shattered glass and spraying blood glisten in the eye-popping starkness of this black and white world, occasionally lit up by flashes of color. Usually these brief moments of vibrancy are reserved for the ladies, who are either arm candy or scheming she-devils. Like the first film, a series of loosely-connected short stories ripped from the comics comprise the bulk of the material, with a couple of new tales that introduce a new character and expand on another. The crisscrossing chronology allows for some dead characters to be seen once again, like Marv and his demented search for answers in ""Just Another Saturday Night"". In that one, Marv, whose head has never been screwed on too tight, cracks heads while trying to figure out why he killed a bunch of guys. A thread from the first film is followed-up on in ""Nancy's Last Dance"", in which the saintly (for Sin City anyway) strip club dancer Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) goes nuts after the death of her savior, John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), and seeks revenge on the politically-connected Roark clan of psychos.

Because so much of Sin City: A Dame to Kill For remains unchanged from before, both in terms of tone and visual flourish, it's the new additions to the cast who are the greatest blast to spend time with. The centerpiece story A Dame to Kill For"" features the dangerously gorgeous Eva Green in various states of undress. No other actress so perfectly embodies the classic femme fatale as Green, who plays Ava Lord in a twisted tale that explains how street hero Dwight (now played by Josh Brolin) came to need that new face he had in the first film. Dwight's always had a soft spot for the ladies and Lord exploits that by calling on him for help against the torturous Manute (Dennis Haysbert) and her abusive billionaire husband. She and Dwight share a troubled romantic past and he can't resist her cries for help or her sexual advances. Of course she's not being totally honest about her situation, and when Dwight enlists Marv (who appears in practically every story) to take down Lord once and for all its bloody and kinky in all the ways we love about Sin City. Green slinks and slithers like a snake with her piercing eyes and Rodriguez lavishes us with every gratuitous shot of her shimmering body. He's as smitten with her as the many men who fall under Lord's spell, which includes Christopher Meloni as a married cop who haplessly carries out her orders. She's everything the title suggests and more.

The best of the fresh material is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's ""The Long Bad Night"", in which the perfectly-suited actor plays Johnny, a cardsharp riding a hot streak and decides to see how far he can take it. With a hot dame (Julia Garner) by his side he decides to take on Sin City's most heinous villain, Senator Roarke (Powers Boothe) in a poker match and wins handily. Winning may have its privileges but not in Sin City, and Roarke makes Johnny's life a gruesome waking nightmare.

Sadly we don't get to see nearly enough of Rosario Dawson as Gale, leader of the Old Town prostitutes, while brief cameos by Ray Liotta, Jeremy Piven, and Stacy Keach mostly serve as ""ah ha"" moments rather than anything memorable. With all the CGI violence and sexy babes this is Rodriguez right in his element, but there's never any attempt to improve on what came before. Sin City was such a game-changer that it's disappointing Rodriguez doesn't try to break new ground with Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. He gives fans all the blood and guts they can handle and absolutely nothing more.",1408752000,4,5465,4.821961620469083
6554906,3,B00M482XH4,"Almost a decade after the release of the first Sin City film, an unconventional hit which wowed curious audiences with its digital wizardry, the topography of the decadent title metropolis is largely unchanged.  The Old Town neighborhood is still populated with leather-clad prostitutes with their own system of justice.  Musclebound, pill-popping Marv still haunts the foulest bars and smashes the faces of their foulest patrons.  (Believable brawler Mickey Rourke capably reprises this role and its prosthetic mug, one of his most memorable turns between his Rumble Fish heyday and his redemptive Academy Award nomination for The Wrestler.)  And the sun, as far as I can see, never rises; in this B&W realm, color is a relative rarity, glimpsed only in a sexy dame's emerald eyes or the crimson geyser of a dying man's blood.  Yes, this world of hard men and their dangerous desires is largely the same, yet nine years have elapsed, and this proves a detriment to the second Sin City film, subtitled A Dame to Kill For and once again spearheaded by writer and director Robert Rodriguez alongside beloved, controversial comics mastermind Frank Miller, who directed a godawful film adaptation of The Spirit by himself in the intervening years.

The idea of blending films and graphic novels by positioning live-action performances in a computerized landscape is, alas, no longer novel, and certain core elements of Sin City experience are rather exhausting the second time around, particularly the nonstop film-noir-pastiche voice-over.  No punch can be thrown without a comparison to a freight train.  No bar can be entered without a purple and poetic description of its odors and textures.  This is first and foremost a feast for the eyes, and I wished now and then I could turn down the volume of the intrusive voices.  Also of note is a problematic multi-story structure which leaves arguably the least interesting of the many subplots--the one focused on Jessica Alba's troubled strip ingnue Nancy and her pining for the ghost of Bruce Willis' cop John Hartigan--for last, rendering the final 25 or so minutes a bit of a dull sit.  There are pleasures and positives, too, including two very welcome new cast members:  Eva Green, in her element and exuding seductive menace as the ultimate untrustworthy lover, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, charismatic and headstrong as a devil-may-care cardsharp aiming to undermine and win against his estranged father, an evil senator portrayed by a sneering, easy-to-despise Powers Boothe.  And the high-style, shadow-on-shadow shot compositions Rodriguez imagines still have the power to amaze (or arouse, or frighten), even if they are no longer a genuine holy-cow revelation.",1408665600,2,2716,5.2304147465437785

6554954,5,B00M482XH4,"I watched this movie in 2D at a friend's house and thought it was pretty good. There are many reviews of the film online, rating it everywhere from awful to excellent. If you've never seen them, and are unfamiliar with the Sin City franchise, you should probably read those before purchase, as it's not everyone's cup of tea. It bums me out how most reviews of home video releases of movies are all lumped together on Amazon, as many have different features, and some are quite superior to others. On that note, my review is on the 3D Blu-Ray, not the movie itself, nor its release on any other format.

Many movies available as 3D Blu-Rays feature post-production 3D. What that means is that the movie is shot on standard 2D cameras, and a fake 3D effect is added later using computers. While with some films (Titanic, The Force Awakens) the effect is rather impressive, it doesn't change the fact that it's fake.

While A Dame To Kill For is heavily manipulated to create the look of the Sin City graphic novels, all the live action sequences were captured with the Arri Alexa 3D digital camera system. What that means, is that before all the computer effects, this movie started with a digital capture of all the live action in true 3D, and it shows. The 3D effect on this Blu-Ray is on par with Avatar, making it a must-have for anyone with a 3D home theater system.

The DTS 5.1 surround is also quite impressive, which, if you like the movie, makes watching it on the 3D Blu-Ray a 5-star immersive experience.",1475798400,,1515,4.542124542124542

6554970,4,B00M482XH4,This movie was a disappointment in comparison to the first one.  I couldn't stand the development of Jessica Alba's character.  Instead of bringing honor to Bruce Willis character; it brought the complete opposite.  I seriously doubt he would love the creature she became in her quest for revenge.

 Recently I watched the sequel Sin City: A Dame To Kill For and found this much more to my liking. More subdued and seemingly focused it also seemed a lot darker than the first one and more concerned with storytelling and acting with the big names more in the background.

The movies are the very definition of artistic. The colours used, the stunts, the effects, all lend to a scene that is reminiscent of reading a graphic novel. This is exactly what has been needed for a long time and I wish there were more of them.

I think a certain amount of love for the film comes from the fact that different directors were tasked with different scenes. It meant the movie didn't have that ""samey"" feel. Whether this would have been the same without it..who knows. Either way, the films are amazing, I would highly recommend them, even just for some good, high profile celebrity features.

The blu-rays are perfect, no scratches. Boxes came unblemished.

6555024,5,B00M482XH4,"Unlike my other Frank Miller defense essays scattered around Amazon, I'll keep this short.

This movie is a perfect adaptation of the comics. It is written and directed by the very person who created the comics. Stylistically it is no different than the comics or the first film. Any complaints you have are null and void. This is movie and comic book history. People dream of the actual comic creator being in full charge of the film version. This is that. So anything you disagree with again is null and void. Because if Frank Miller created these characters and comics, he can do what he wants. Regular movie goes seemed to expect something new and fresh compared to the first film. What they don't understand is that this is the perfect adaptation of the comics by their creator, exactly like the first one. They can not and should not expect any more.

Above everything else i love about this film is the cast. Not just for their performances which are perfect. But they LOVED making this film. Any interview with them you see they sincerely loved making this film and working with Miller. But more-so they were so passionate about, why? Because it was a pure and truthful adaptation of art by the exact same artist. They were part of something truthful. This isn't a film by commitee like the Marvel films. This is an artist at work doing what he loves. And how often to actors get to be part of something like that. And you can see and hear their disappointment and confusion as to why the film failed. It's exactly what it promised to be: Sin City.

Side note, I LOVED the new ""yarns"". Its amazing to be able to see new storytelling from the master Frank Miller. I only wish he would one day release them as comics.

6555041,3,B00M482XH4,"What Frank Miller does here is akin to his treatment in the monumental failure, The Spirit. Without the magic of Tarantino on their side, the film was cursed from the start, after numerous technical setbacks, the death of two stars and numerous projects on Rodriguez's behalf. The result is not a second installment in Miller's acclaimed series, but a half-assed attempt at a Blockbuster sequel that casts shame upon its proceeding film. The page-to-screen effects that made the original film a visual masterpiece now appear cheesy and overdone. The arrangement of stories from both A Dame to Kill For, and Just Another Saturday Night (Booze, Broads & Bullets) appear beside two Miller originals written for the film, each just as empty and meaningless as the last. As usual, Jessica Alba is nothing more than eye-candy who manages to insult the buxom written version of Nancy even more if possible. As it whole, the film seems to have closed the door to any possibility of a third and final Hell and Back adaptation which formerly rumored Johnny Depp to be cast as Wallace. Perhaps the biggest shame of it all is that Miller has done it all to himself, taking what could have been a masterpiece and murdering a dream to be left behind with the other slew of victims from his yarns. The 3/5 is merely a courtesy for the seven wonderful graphic novels Frank Miller has given us. Overall one of the most overwhelming disappointments of the last few years.",1450915200,3,1453,4.792828685258964

6555061,5,B00M482XH4,"Sin City: A Dame to Kill for is a strong follow-up to Sin City the down fall of this film was the time gap between the original film and the follow up
I see this film at the theater in 3-D and really enjoyed it .  It's a film this different and unique and was made for 3-D

The Story is mostly a epilogue of the original film and going into it most people won't add this up

The Cast:
Jessica Alba returns as Nancy (In my honest opinion this is Alba's best performance) she proves she can act when given the right script
Mickey Rourke returns as Marv  (Rourke once again gives a great performance)
Jaime King returns  as  Goldie / Wendy
Powers Boothe returns as Senator Roark  (This is Boothe's film he is flat out scary and caries a lot of the film) he's performance alone makes this film a must see!
Rosario Dawson returns as Gail  (we don't get enough Rosario in this film) great seeing Gail though
Bruce Willis returns as  Hartigan  (Bruce Willis stinks i grew up with his films but, dear God he is sleep walking  through this film he only returned to get a pay check it's sad everyone else is really good except Willis and I'm sure the ego manic got pay better then Powers Boothe!

New Actors to Sin City:
Joseph Gordon-Levitt  as Johnny (great job all around it's cool to see a fleshed out version of Johnny)
Josh Brolin  as Dwight (his story takes place before he is introduced as Clive Owen in the original film you are given the reason why he changed his face) Brolin does a great job the only problem with the film and Dwight in this film is when you see him with the new face
I wish they were able to use Clive Owen's face to do this scene it would've worked much better
Eva Green  as  Ava  (This was originally meant to go to Angelina Jolie if she stuck with this film it would've been watered down the Mommy Angelina wouldn't have no any nudity or gone 100% in to deliverer what we got from Eva
Eva Green is flat out amazing she is the other person that does a lot of the hard lifting!
Replacements:
 Dennis Haysbert as Manute  (replacing the late Michael Clarke Duncan does a good job he's doing the best he can)
Jamie Chung  as  Miho  (replacing the pregnant Devon Aoki I think Jamie is a much better version of Miho this is the version from the graphic albums)
you get interesting cameos by
Ray Liotta,  Christopher Meloni,  Juno Temple, Christopher Lloyd,  Lady Gaga
With Brittany Murphy (RIP)  passing away Shellie was completely removed.....

The home video 3-D version is close to perfect the 3-D looks great on par with the Theatrical 3-D
Getting a film with the colors mixed with the 3-D was brilliant a film with this much style needs to be in 3-D it works better then so many films that don't...
The biggest problem with the 3D Blu ray is lack of any real extras
The extras stinks

This is a must have for anyone with a 3-D set up. This film is best watched in 3-D mostly cause the look and 3D complement each other so wheel

6555069,2,B00M482XH4,"There are some directors that just don't feel confident letting a great thing go in favor of something new. Ive always had a grudging respect for Robert Rodriguez since his debut with EL MARIACHI, proving that a director with some guts and ambition could make such a high-energy debut on such a tiny budget. But he keeps traveling back to his own well, such as it is, and keeps making films that don't complete things, but actually make them less palatable. He wasn't satisfied with DESPERADO, which is a much higher budget remake of sorts, of EL MARIACHI by creating ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO, which is the least of that series. He wasn't satisfied with the charm he suffused into the original SPY KIDS, so he kept making terrible sequels. And apparently, he wasn't satisfied with the game-changer of the original SIN CITY, and so he returned with that films co-director and creator of its source material Frank Miller, and decided to sully his achievements once more with SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR.

This film, like the first one, isn't quite in chronological order, but tells a series of stories. The pre-credits story is an adaptation of the tale Just Another Saturday Night, where Marv (reprised here by Mickey Rourke) takes on some rich kid sociopaths who are burning winos for fun in the slum area known as Old Town. Then the story shifts to a new tale of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a handsome hotshot gambler whos come to Sin City to gamble against Senator Roark (reprised by Powers Boothe) and to settle an old score. Johnny wins big and loses big in a much worse way, and then the story shifts again to the centerpiece story, with Dwight (Josh Brolin) as a private eye whose obsession with his former love Ava (Eva Green) leads to murder and his almost total destruction. Then its back to Johnny who isn't just out for settling a score; hes out for revenge. And then, were back with Nancy Callahan (reprised by Jessica Alba), the stripper who is still mourning the death of Hartigan (reprised here in visions by Bruce Willis), the cop who saved her from Roarks villainous son and killed himself to protect Nancy from Roarks vengeance. But now its Nancy whos out for vengeance. Swirling deeper into alcoholism and insanity, she dupes Marv into helping her kill him, but could they succeed?

The idea of Sin City as a place that swallows souls and then excretes them into hell is not exactly a new one, but thats a forgivable sin from this particular universe. What isn't is how repetitive the idea is put on display here; so much so that it becomes corny. And there is worse to come. The thing that stands out visually is how miserable this film looks in comparison to the original. Shot almost entirely against green screen with CG backdrops was revolutionary back when the first film was made, and it still holds up. But it being nine years later and with the advances made in CG effects, youd think it would look better than the original. Spoiler alert: it doesnt. It looks cheap and thrown together. Even worse, so do the stories. While the centerpiece A Dame to Kill For holds up and really stands out, the new stories that Miller wrote for the film, particularly the one about Nancys quest for revenge, are just dull. And perhaps worst of all are the majority of performances. With the exceptions of Green and Gordon-Levitt, who are brilliant in just about everything, almost all the returning cast, and most of the new members just seem to be sleepwalking through most of the scenes, allowing the visuals to completely take over. Mickey Rourke, so vital and energized in the first film, seems utterly bored by what he has to do here. Brolin is serviceable but adds no dimensions to the pre-op Dwight (who was played with much more verve in the first film by Clive Owen, post-op). Yes, hes a classic schmuck that falls for the wrong woman again and again, but he just doesnt seem to care enough about his actual performance. Rosario Dawson is probably the only returning player that seems to be having a good time as Gail. And while tragically, Michael Clarke Duncan died before he could play the hulking Manute again, Dennis Haysbert does a nice job paying some respect to what Clarke did before. Other players like Christopher Meloni, Jeremy Piven, Ray Liotta, and Willis all just seem to be there just to get that check. And don't even get me started on Jessica Alba. Not only is she an eternally poor actress, but I was so disappointed in Miller actually thinking that it was a good idea to build an entire B-story around her.

So this film not only looks cheap, but it sounds cheap, showing how much Miller has lost not only his flair but his flavor for this kind of work. And Rodriguez, who does seem to care, just lacks any real energy with this sequel. All of the style of the first film is almost entirely absent. Its a film that lacks both style AND substance, and thats best left to the hack directors of the world. And while I could never claim the Rodriguez was a GREAT director, hes usually been a good one, but none of what made him good is on display in this film.

From a fan perspective, it felt like this film sat in development hell for a little too long since theyve been talking about a sequel for about seven years. That might be the reason that Rodriguez and Miller finally decided to make this film now; maybe they just needed to get it out there so they could move on. And in theory, that should have been enough to make a good film, but SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR is just not anywhere close to the original in quality or style.

2 out of 5 Stars.",1444435200,2,5598,4.533135509396637
6555070,2,B00M482XH4,"I absolutely LOVED the original Sin City. Waiting 9 years to come up with a sequel has killed the franchise. When the original Sin City was released, it was different, it was fresh, people were intrigued by the graphic novel premise. Waiting so long for a sequel, all that is long gone, nobody cares any more (thus the box office BOMB). Overall the second installment doesn't hold a candle compared to the first, it is just awful. The story is poor, the new characters are not interesting, the changes to certain characters (i.e. actors) are on big miss, Jessica Alba's acting is as bad as ever (I don't care how hot she is). Everything about this movie seems subpar when compared to the first. I like Josh Brolin, but sorry Clive Owen was a far better Dwight and they replaced Miho!!!! I know Devon Aoki retired from acting but the new Miho is one big MEH!! Overall I am sorry I paid for this, I would have been better off waiting to see it on cable for free.",1443571200,2,960,4.398876404494382

6555078,5,B00M482XH4,"As good as the first installment.  Sin City is my favorite franchise when it comes to films based on comic books.  The cinematogrsaphy and special effects are fantastic, the acting is superb, and the plot is to die for.  I hope they will produce another one and make it a trilogy.

The plot of the second Sin City revolves around: Nancy (Jessica Alba) the go-go dancer and her growing feeling to avenge Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who got killed in the first part.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Johnny, a man obsessed with gambling and with beating Senator Roark at a poker game (some family bad blood involved).  The major part of the film concentrates on Dwight (Josh Brolin) who is a private-eye for hire, and who one night receives a phone call from his ex-girlfriend Ava (Eva Green) who happens to be a typical dame in distress or rather femme-fatale in ""distress"".  There is also the kind hearted and always looking for action Marv (Mickey Rourke), and a cop (Christopher Meloni) who happens to fall in love with Ava.  All these characters together with their own private issues make this for an entertaining spectacle...it is like watching noir comic book come alive...if you liked part one...you will also like the continuation of the story.",1441756800,,1243,4.830188679245283

The 3D really brought it to life. I highly recommend in your 3D collection if you enjoy 3D.

If you get offended with nudity and violence, this film is obviously not for you. Eva Green is naked many times.

I thought I would enjoy watching the first Sin City after enjoying this second series in 3D, but I was completely wrong; the first Sin City dragged on so much and extremely repetitive.

More people seem to like the original and were disappointed with this one, but I feel COMPLETELY opposite. I HATE Sin City (2005), but I enjoyed 2014's A Dame to Kill (Sin City 2)

I can watch A Dame to Kill (Sin City 2) multiple viewings, but I have no desire or interest to watch the first original again (although I think the first one could look amazing in 3D too if they were to release it; however, I wouldn't care for the story - so repetitive!).",1439596800,3,1089,4.425

The first time I managed to pry the discs apart as carefully as I could, but the bluray then would not play (I've got hundreds of blurays, so it's not the player). The 2nd set received was again fused together (needing to be forcibly pried apart), and was immediately returned for a refund. Blurays are delicate creatures (even with the extra thickness).

SO - this is a warning to all who want to watch the bluray. Crummy, thoughtless packaging! Did not want the 3D disc, it just came with it and was the only way to purchase the disc.

Not in the ""that's way too over the top"" like in movies like the first Sin City, or Shoot Em Up, but rather, that these cool action scenes were just half-heartedly done.  There's one instance where Miho, one of the most badass assassin's in cinematic history, is running from guys shooting at her, and she's jogging like she's on a treadmill.  No sense of urgency.  Jessica Alba's acting was terrible.  Like first year student film terrible.

Love the juxtaposition of the black and white with splashes of intense color at the exactly right parts of the movie.  Acting and plot surprisingly better than I expected. The women...Gorgeous and sensuous.  The men....A classic set of life-beaten, hard bitten, scarred, battered, and indomitable tough-guys as you are likely to see anywhere, movies or real life.
Sound was good...It followed the action pretty well.  Voices understandable.  Much violence and blood, some of it red (just where it should have been in the movie) all of it in the style of the graphic novel.

6555186,2,B00M482XH4,"I watched the first Sin City at least five times. Normally I won't watch a movie more than once unless I really, really like it, so that tells you something. The first was so innovative and entertaining that the movie would be over in what seemed like a matter of minutes. A dame to kill for had the opposite problem, it dragged on and on.

It seemed like the director told all the voiceover actors to use their rough, whisper voices to make them sound tougher. At times this was called for, but not throughout most of the movie. At some points it was almost comical. It especially didn't worth for Joseph Gordon Levitt who simply doesn't have the right voice for this approach. They finally let him use his normal voice for the second part of  his scene, if you were able to make it that far in the movie.

Stories- While the visuals were improved, the plots were actually fairly boring. The one about the card player was by far the biggest disappointment. Seriously, devoting an entire story and then ending it exactly as you expected in the beginning? Talk about a waste of time and film.

The vignette with Eva Green was by far the best of the plot lines if you can get past the fact that Brolin replaced Owens. It would have been less physical in nature with Owens because the Dwight character seemed like more of a gunslinger in the first film, but a rough and tumble fighter in the second. Maybe I enjoyed it most because it incorporated more of the Sin City environment instead of attacking mostly one building or compound like the others. It had more depth and fullness, consuming quite a bit of the film.

It seems like someone decided to try to cash in on the success of the first installment, yet they weren't sure how to build on the powerhouse that as the first film. The second failed to keep me engaged. In fact, other than wondering how it would end, I considered turning it off half way through. Yeah, it was that bad. And this is coming from someone who couldn't wait to see it after how much I enjoyed the first one. Such a shame to smear the sanctity of the Sin City label with such slop.",1431302400,,2109,4.383631713554987

Even Marv (Mickey Rourke) looks weird here. In the first Sin City, his makeup and character was exaggerated but to good effect. Here, he looks bizarre and his actions are strictly plot driven. Last time, he was confused, heavily dependent on his medication and driven to avenge the murder of Goldie. Now, he is just being a good guy.
Bruce Williss character, Hartigan, is a ghost. Really? Was it that important to get his name back on the marquee?

That film was Sin City.  After the filmmakers completed this movie they swept the floor of the editing room, gathering the leftover scraps of unwanted film negative, dirt, filth, Cheetos and rat excrement and placed it all into an empty tuna can.  Many years later they reopened the can and glued all the contents together and voila, Sin City 2: Electric Boogaloo.  This movie is just bad, especially when compared to the first installment.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is in recognition of Eva Green's amazing acting talent.  She portrays Ava, a truly diabolical, twisted and manipulative individual.  I usually find such characters aggravating to watch, but I couldn't take my eyes of Green.

Actually, the plots in the movie start off as prequels but later start to twist the timeline and muddle the settings and characters into alternate timeline versions of those in City. This may have worked on paper, but on the screen it just doesn't feel fresh anymore, and none of the stories play out in a compelling way. Sure, there's still the sharp grey-scale imagery and the brutal violence, but it's all a pale imitation of what we've seen before. The returning players aren't as visceral either, with Eva Green being the only standout newcomer - she dazzles in every scene she's in but still isn't enough to make it a worthwhile experience.",1425168000,,771,4.676470588235294

The time is set four years after the last movie: Bruce Willis is now a ghost that manifests himself only to Jessica Alba (hot as ever!)..Mickey Rourke's character is now her protector ( and as dangerous and unstoppable as ever)..little Miho is all grown up and even deadlier than before...all the girls of Sin City are still around.

Nine years have passed since then, and finally the second Sin City movie arrives, which is both a sequel and prequel. That means you are going to meet Mickey Rourkes Marv again, which is a good thing, but somehow the new film Sin City: A Dame to Kill For itself is not as impressive as it should be.

Perhaps it is because of the weak stories. Old characters and new characters  a mysterious gambler played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt especially  need a better story. Or perhaps it is because of the confusing storytelling and casting. Devon Aoki did not return for the role of Miho (played here by Jamie Chung). Bruce Willis returns when he has very little to do. Or maybe it is just that the new entry lacks novelty.

Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For gives exactly what you expect from the duo: highly stylized visuals populated with dark and quirky characters. Except the unique players including Josh Brolin, Eva Green and Christopher Lloyd, however, the new film has nothing new to offer.",1423094400,2,1160,4.616504854368932

6555330,1,B00M482XH4,"You ever watch a movie that makes you question other decisions or even other opinions you may personally have felt justified or validated over time?  You ever stare into the soul of your television screen and ask yourself, is all I thought it was really not what it is at all?

Despite the above paragraph sounding like the ponderings of a profound, intelligent and poignant cinematic experience, they arent.  They are the ponderings of a grown man confused that his twenty-something self actually defended a film that, judging from this awful sequel, probably sucked pretty hard.  I haven't seen Sin City in years (like, not since 2005), but my recollection of it was that it was inspired, entertaining and fresh filmmaking, with an engaging story and a cast of memorable characters and nicely done performances.  Like, wasn't Rourke up for Oscar consideration for it?  But, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is so incredibly AWFUL that Im second guessing any positive thoughts I ever had for the original.

Help me; was the first one good or have I just grown up?

I don't even know what all to say here.  There is so much wrong here.  The storylines are not cohesive enough to feel like a rewarding tapestry film, for everything feels so sharply divided, despite having minimal crossover elements.  But, beyond that, the stories themselves aren't remotely interesting, or at least they aren't developed in an interesting manner.  In an attempt to basically create a graphic (pun intended) film noir, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez forgot to infuse any real passion or emotion into any aspect of the film.  Every character either comes off as a complete non-entity (like, wood has more depth) or a caricature, and not a good one (I love you Eva Green, but this mess of a performance is an embarrassment of non-riches).  The dialog is laughable, the effects feel more gimmicky than inspired this go around, and the decision to place the entire finale in Jessica Albas shaky hands was a HUGE mistake.

What was she doing?

So, if you want to watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt get his fingers broken (and Im sure some of you do) or you want to watch Josh Brolin get betrayed by a woman (which Im sure some of you do) or you want to see Jessica Alba pretend to strip (no one wants to see that awful tease), wait for a better movie, because this atrocity of filmmaking isn't worth your time; at all.",1423008000,,2387,4.701923076923077

I was pleased with Frank Miller's last film, The Spirit, and was hoping for either more of the same or more of what Robert Rodriguez brought to the first Sin City film. To my great disappointment, I got neither out of it. This film failed in almost every aspect of what should make a movie worthwhile (to me, anyway). The flow of the stories did not work as it did with the first film. The acting was mostly awful this time around, and for the actors that could act, I found that I didn't give a hoot if they lived or died. I really wanted to like this movie, but the magic of the first film seemed to have dried up while waiting for this one to come about.

To watch these movies I pretty much need the electronic version and view them on the PC, mainly because I cannot control Panasonic Blu-ray with my environmental control system. I don't mind paying a little extra for this option, but I expect it to be functional. Mainly in the last six months the electronic versions (an extra CD) has been replaced with the option to watch via streaming. That's okay if it works, in most cases I've found it doesn't. These companies don't have their act together, and unfortunately that's the case with ""sin city: a Dame to kill"". Sounds like a trivial matter, but to me it's not. I paid for this movie but I'm not getting the opportunity to watch it. In short, my wife filled out the information (again this is because of my disability). At one point you are asked to choose a ""provider"". In the interests of keeping all these movies organized I chose ""Flixster"". After the process I was informed of an error and to use a different ""vendor"" to watch the movie. Only problem is when you try to do this it claims the code given to you has already been used and is no longer valid. And guess what there's no way to contact anybody from these vendors to get any technical assistance or help in getting a new code. Bottom line I'm screwed unless I'm able to surf the maze just to get some help.
What's it take to put up a customer service line, and less you anticipate issues and don't want to deal with them. The crime, being I paid for this service when I purchased the movie (yes it is more than buying without the electronic service).",1420934400,,1611,4.445945945945946

Not to mention the fact that is also included a cast that starred everyone and their mother. Almost 10 years have past since that film's release and now we finally have Sin City: A Dame to Kill for. Unfortunately, it did not provide the follow up most fans were looking for. If was overly stylized the stories were not all great and I wasn't too thrilled about the fact that they created content for the film and didn't continue to entirety use the material from the graphic novels. The highlights of the film was the return of Mickey Rourke as Marv, the addition of Eva Green and Joseph Gordon-Levitt to the cast and expanding the Powers Boothe character, just so he could get more screen time. Finally, having Josh Brolin to play the role of Dwight was a good choice, because the whole reason of using him instead of Clive Owen is exactly the way it works in the original material. Still, it would have been nice for Clive Owen to return for the part that made sense to use him.

It was very nice to have Sin City back on the big screen, but as far as I am concerned, A Dame to Kill for, missed the mark slightly. I don't know if there will be a final installment to wrap the whole story up, but I guess time will tell.",1420416000,,1323,4.229249011857707

Eva Green (a chest to die for) was the perfect choice as the sexual villain and Jessica Alba is even sexier in this version. The only problem I had is with the movie timeline. This being a sequel, Bruce Willis is viewed as a ghost, but Marv has somehow come back to life? I was glad to see Rosario Dawson is back, but I missed Devon Aoki as ""deadly little Miho"" and Brittany Murphy (who passed away recently).",1420070400,,499,4.2631578947368425

6555436,3,B00M482XH4,"The original Sin City was probably my favorite film of 2005, which is saying a lot considering some of the competition. There was just something about the super-stylized, gritty, ultra-violent noir that made me fall in love with the universe. The action and the pacing were enough to keep the 2 hour movie from ever feeling long or boring.

Now, just south of a decade later, we're presented with the not-a-sequel-not-a-prequel-but-both-at-the-same-time Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. Fortunately, a lot of the things fans of the first movie liked are still present here: mainly black and white with selective use of color, creating a crisp and bleakly beautiful film; hard-nosed antiheroes and square-jawed brutes serving up their own brand of justice, which includes routine gun battles, amputations, decapitations, and other gory goods whilst offering deliciously melodramatic monologues; and a non-chronological way to tell the story. Granted, at this point all of the aforementioned stuff has been done before and, in some cases, done better by other movies, but if that's what drew you into the original Sin City there is still plenty to enjoy here.

That's not to say that everything is good or particularly well-done. Personally, I felt one of the four principle stories of the film went on too long and chewed up too much valuable screen time. Despite the runtime that's shorter than its predecessor, I actually found myself slightly bored at times during this film. I also found one of the stories roughly anti-climatic, and there is a strange retcon/continuity issue between Sin City and A Dame that some might find bothersome if they're trying to enjoy the series as contiguous events instead of more self-contained stories. I feel Sin City had just the right amount of melodrama to make the super-noir thing work for it, and it was often punctuated or broken up by distinctly dark humor. Here that humor is farther between and the deliveries given by several of the actors can be so over-the-top, which makes A Dame feel like it might be toe-ing the line to parody.

While I'm certain that it's not likely to win over any converts that the original didn't, A Dame to Kill For is still a decent amount of fun for fans of the original or fans of the style of film. It's unfortunate that die-hard fans of the original will likely be turned off by the briefly aforementioned continuity issue, though there are theories online explaining said issue away. Not particularly worth repeated viewings, but should be a worthwhile initial hour and a half if you're a fan of the genre.",1419897600,,2584,4.922018348623853

6555455,3,B00M482XH4,"Given the fertile ground that Sin City provides for writers it's sad that this is the best they could come up with. Marv gets manipulated twice into fighting someone else's battles in this movie even while one of Marv's manipulators is himself being manipulated, it was too much of the same. it felt like they were beating a dead horse. Then there's Nancy Callahan who was the light in the darkness of Sin City in the first Movie and is now just a half crazed alcoholic wreak who's beauty somehow hasn't faded despite her self abuse. Then she cuts up her face and blames Senator Roark to manipulate Marv into helping her kill Roark. The biggest problem with this Movie was Nancy and Marv's inconsistent characters, one minute Marv is the crazy but heroic Marv from the first movie then the next he's everyone's fool to be used as they see fit or he just doesn't seem to care at all about Nancy's condition, then he's willing to go to war for her, and Nancy is a whacked out basket case who can't pull the trigger on her hated enemy or even hold herself together one minute, then she's a master manipulator and a one girl killing machine the next. Unlike the first Movie there was no Good Vs. Evil, it was more like the Evil Vs. the More Evil. Then there was the cute little blond hooker who seemed sweet but her part was small and she died too quickly, too bad a little light in the darkness could have helped this Movie a lot. And Roark's Son, for a kid who seemed smart he sure was dumb, they should have left his whole part on the cutting room floor since it all ended up being pointless anyway.",1419638400,5,1598,4.3478260869565215

By comparison, the first film simply had so much more to offer. The first ""Sin City"" was overflowing with over-the-top action, violence and sex all supported with beautiful cinematography. Everything was so electric and fresh upon its debut. But now the sequel's black-and-white format feels tired, the acting is weaker, and worst of all, the stories are quite boring.

Bear in mind that the original got to cherry-pick the best of the comics for its anthology, while this version is literally built from the leftovers that were passed over the first time. The best story here is not as good as the worst of the original. Likewise, the prior film's breathless pace slows to a series of overlong monologues and subpar action sequences.

Still, the nutso pulp/black-comedy/action/thriller vibe of the franchise is a singular and unique flavor. So the film ultimately still packs some punch for fans of those genres with these gritty antiheroes and their underworld misadventures.",1419206400,,1098,5.021978021978022

When Mitch Ryder sang ""Devil in the Blue Dress"" he must have had Green in mind.  Jessica Alba returning here as the revenge bent stripper Nancy Callahan is no slouch in the looks department but comparatively speaking Green makes her look like a little boy.

6555517,4,B00M482XH4,"THE FILM: It's been 9 years since the groundbreaking SIN CITY came out, and the question on a lot of people's minds is probably if it was worth the wait. There's been massive advancements in terms of special effects since then, so how does this long-awaited sequel compare? The answer might be a little disappointing, but in no way was this worth a 9-year wait. Still, I am big enough of a fan that it was exciting to visit this world again, filled with its seedy characters, and hopefully that will be enough to bring fans of the first one back. Like the first, this is a series of interconnected film noir stories that explore various inhabitants of the titular Sin City. This time, there are three of them: ""Just Another Saturday Night,"" ""The Big Score,"" and ""A Dame to Kill For."" In the first story, Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) is still hasn't completely gotten over the death of Hartigan (Bruce Willis, who makes a few brief appearances as a figment of Nancy's imagination). She then teams up with Marv to take out Senator Rourke (Powers Boothe). In ""The Big Score,"" Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a really lucky gambler who ends up getting in over his head. And in the title story, Dwight (Josh Brolin) gets caught back in the snare of Ava Lord (Eva Green). All of these stories were basically of the same style as those in the first, but this time they felt less connected and woven together. In fact, I almost would have preferred seeing the stories separately and fleshed out a little more, because the only story which felt complete was the main one, which takes up about half of the 102-minute running time. It was also the best of the three, with Eva Green doing her best femme fatale and showing off her amazing body. None of the performances are what I would call great, but they weren't bad and generally fit the pulpy subject matter. There's also the issue of the gigantic cast. There were a lot of big names, but most of them amounted to little more than cameos. Part of me wishes that they come out with an extended version like they did with the first Sin City. Moving on to the visual effects, there wasn't really any change from the way it was done the first time, except the addition of 3D. I have to be honest here, everything looked fantastic and the level of detail and imagination that went into this was just as cool as it was the first time around, if a little unoriginal. Overall, this was a welcome return to the hard-boiled world of Sin City. They didn't really change anything or try something new, but it should be enough to please fans of the original. I certainly enjoyed it.

THE EXTRAS: There's a fair amount of supplementary material that pulls the curtains back and allows a cool perspective onto how this film was made. The first, and most enlightening, of these is a 16-minute reel of footage that shows the bulk of the film without all of the digital augmentation. Basically, it fast-forwards through the raw footage of the film and you get to see the green-screen sets and what things looked like before animators gave it its trademark look. There are also four character profiles on Ava, Dwight, Nancy and Johnny. Here, Eva Green, Josh Brolin, Jessica Alba and Joseph Gordon-Levitt talk about their characters and experiences working on the film. Next, there is a 6-minute featurette on the visual effects in which you get to see how they created a few of the practical effects, like Stacy Keach's Wallenquist and the part where Josh Brolin's eye almost comes out of his head. The last featurette is about the wire-work and stunts. They also have the Blu-ray trailer for the original Sin City. Put together, there's not a whole lot of stuff, but what they have is enlightening to a degree and provides some interesting extra information.

OVERALL: The novelty of the first one has definitely worn off, but fans of the original shouldn't mind taking another trip to Sin City. There's also a small, but significant array of special features that enhance the experience. Basically, if you liked the first one you should enjoy this one as well.",1418601600,,4088,4.637241379310344
6555518,5,B00M482XH4,"I think it is every bit as good as the first Sin City. Glad to see Mickey Rourke in it as well. LOVE,LOVE ,LOVE IT.",1418515200,,115,3.64

6555520,5,B00M482XH4,"The original Sin City, in my opinion, will probably rank as one of the top 20 movies (if not top 10) of the 2000s. It is destined to be a cult classic.

What made the original great was its dark anti-establishment theme coupled with original cinematography and action. This movie is less dark and far less anti-establishment than the original. But to me, it is actually a little more entertaining. I have watched this movie twice.

The movie did right by focusing on Marv, who is supremely portrayed by Mickey Rourke. Marv is a strange mixture of a psychopath with some moral values (he never hits women and likes to help the helpless). Marv has superhuman strength and endurance, and even greater ability to endure pain.  He also likes to kill anyone he dislikes, including cops, with raging animal passion and strong contemptuous disregard for the consequences. His strange inconsistencies are as fascinating as his supernatural ability to endure pain. Marv is the most entertaining superhero I have ever seen.  Marv, in my opinion, could be the new superhero focus of many more movies.

The first movie was anti-establishment to the core. Its antagonists were priests, politicians, police, and tycoons. The original was audacious and highly insulting in its beastly portrayal of those in power. And I loved it. This time, the antagonists have been watered down to a single psychopathic dame (Eva Green) and a maniac politician (Senator). Perhaps the producers thought the original movie offended too many people in power, but that was also what made the original great. To me, this movie isn't great. It is merely very good.

Finally, the endings were a big letdown. The ending of the Gordon Levitt character was a big letdown as well as the revenge of the Jessica Alba's character.

Pros:
1)Worthy of the cinematic masterpiece of the original.
2)Engaging story with wildly psychotic protagonists. Marv is the new superhero.
3)Little funnier but less darker than the original.
4)Highly entertaining.

Cons:
1)Less anti-establishment than the original. This movie is far less bold than the original, and that makes it for a less daring movie.
2)The endings were a letdown. The endings did not have the satisfactory bite of the original.",1418515200,2,2238,5.02972972972973

6555524,3,B00M482XH4,"As most would agree, the sequel is not nearly as interesting/compelling as the first film.  Nevertheless, Eva Green (as Ava) really carries the show.  She is the centerpiece of this movie, and moves it along with her shifts from a complete bitch to someone with a hidden heart.  Beyond that her performance is memorizing and stunning.  She exudes raw sexuality that completely manipulates Josh Brolin (Dwight), and it's hard not to fall into Dwight's weaknesses.  It was fun to see Mickey Rourke as his Marv character again.  I missed seeing Clive Owen, but you can't have everything.  Powers Boothe is outstanding as the big bad guy.  All in all this presented a pretty entertaining film for me.  I didn't expect as much as from ""Sin City,"" so I didn't cry about some of the let-downs.  As a sequel it still had plenty of punch, so I didn't find myself terribly disappointed.",1418428800,2,876,4.741721854304636

6555530,3,B00M482XH4,"As might be expected, this was lovingly crafted. The style as well as the story are each more cluttered and less clean than in the first film. This time I had much more of a feeling of a rehash of old Hollywood pulp-noir themes and character-types. In that there was a feeling of watching a photocopy of a photocopy (which the high-contrast black-and-white sometimes intensified), as noir send-ups have gone around several times since the 40s. Some of the visuals were quite enjoyable, but I didn't have a sense of depth in the story or characters, beyond what was already explored in the first film. Purely on the visual effects I would watch and somewhat enjoy this. But there was nothing like the striking impression the first time around. And perhaps as an older guy now I question the idea of heroes who seem to have the ethos and impulse control of mere substance-addicted and sex-addicted small-time gang members. It is harder to craft virtuous characters, I think, and too much the easy road to merely resort to violence as a path to viewer stimulation.",1418342400,2,1061,4.7405405405405405
6555531,1,B00M482XH4,"Disappointed to say the least. The first movie was so amazing... I was astounded how bad this one was.

It seems like one big, ""hey, what are some little nonessential questions I need answered from the first story?"" tale that no one should give two fudges about. This is Rodriguez's Episode I debacle.

(Unrelated Side Note: Why does Robert keep putting his once child star of Spy Kids in sexy roles? It seems wrong for some reason. She didn't even have a role per se in this film. If she was a sexy protagonist, or even a slinky she devil, I could assume he was forwarding her career, but I feel like this is just exploitation at this point.)",1418342400,,659,4.446280991735537

The storyline was rushed, and quite a bit left out with the addition of Joseph Gordon Levitt's character who never appeared in the comics. Jonny's story took away from the film by rushing through Eva Green's story, so if you read them don't get too excited about seeing the sexy assassin at work.

6555536,2,B00M482XH4,"Sometimes the critics are right. If you liked the original you may not hate this one, but it's doubtful you'll think it's nearly as good or was worth the decade-long wait. Yeah, it looks great, just like the first. Yeah, it has some of the same cast and characters. Yeah, it has Eva Green with no clothes on in most of her scenes, and she has a lot of scenes. And yeah, when it gets really rolling, which it does in a very few spurts, it recreates the original's mad ultra-noir ultra-violent visual poetry. But that's just in a very few spurts, with a lot of fiddling and fooling around in-between. I mean, I'm as big a fan of pretty nekkid ladies as anyone, but even I got bored with Eva Green's breasts after a while. It's too much like they're there to distract you from the fact that there's no real pulse or narrative drive to this one. Of the sort of interlocking stories, only the long middle one (with Green) is of any interest, or has a real flow; the others just sort of putter around a while and end abruptly. To make it worse, the pseudo-noir voice-over and dialogue this time are awful, approaching self-parody at times. Like I said, you may not hate it if you're into this stuff, but you're pretty sure to be underwhelmed. Ultimately, I think they could have left it on the shelf forever.",1418256000,,1302,4.384297520661157

Jessica Alba is aging and it shows, but she is aging a lot better than most.  Powers Boothe is just plain evil and plays the part extremely well.

Michael Clarke Duncan died and was recast by Dennis Hausbert. Brit Murphy died and character was removed out of respect. Devon Aoki was pregnant and recast by Jamie Chung. I have nothing against those actors but it would have been 100 times better with the original cast.

Now I know what your thinking the director was doing something big and had no time but he made a kids movie Shorts and was having sex with Rose McGowan. He should have just made Sin City 2 instead.

6555575,4,B00M482XH4,"Sin City: where you find what you want, and learn you don't want it at all. Like a reckless gambler who decides to take on the villainous Senator who runs the entire town.  Or the P.I., whose ex-lover slips back into his life...with a price.  Or the rough-and-tumble Marv, who never wants anything more than to take on someone as strong as himself. Or the stripper, who sought revenge until she found the bottom of the bottle.

Brought to you in the same glaring black and white, the same brilliant splashes of red, SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR is more of the same.  Which is both a strength and a weakness.  First, the bad: the film feels inferior, because it isn't as fresh.  And the ending is surprisingly weak.  Also, the time line can be a little confusing, especially because Dwight's plastic surgery doesn't come off as believable (Clive Owen apparently couldn't reprise his role, or wouldn't for a key scene).  Hint: most of the film takes place prior to the last one.  Fans of the graphic novels might have a better time following the story.  I'll get around to reading them some day, I promise; I have a really long to-read list.

Now, the good: it's fun.  It's awesome.  It's all the bada**ery you'd expect from a Robert Rodriguez/Frank Miller collaboration.  And the cast is just terrific.  Returning from the original, we have: Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe (with much more to do, and he does it so exquisitely well), Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis (limited, but welcome), and probably some others; it's a huge cast.  The newcomers shine: Josh Brolin holds down a solid portion of the film as the before-Dwight; Eva Green (perhaps the definitive example of a classic actress unafraid to do B-grade entertainment for the fun of it) tantalizes and seduces as the titular dame.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeremy Piven, Christopher Lloyd, Ray Liotta, Lady Gaga, and Christopher Meloni all help round things out with parts big and small.  And Dennis Haysbert does a very good (and intimidating) job of filling in for the late Michael Clarke Duncan.

This isn't a film for movie snobs.  It's a film for people who love to have fun...and live dangerously.  Robert Rodriguez, apart from his side career as a family film auteur (and frankly I can't stomach them), has made a career out of turning schlock into art.  Anyone who hasn't seen DESPERADO should do so pronto and just marvel.  SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR isn't on that same level.  It isn't even on par with the first SIN CITY film.  But DAME is this: bloody, artsy good fun, with a healthy sense of humor and absolutely no mercy.  In Sin City, turn down any dark alley and you may find what you want.  If you're unlucky enough, you may also find what you need.",1417651200,,2719,4.633891213389122

6555579,3,B00M482XH4,"So. Here goes. I saw the original Sin City, not knowing what to expect- and wasn't any original fan of Frank Miller, the Sin City franchise etc. All I knew is that it reminded me vaguely of a video game series I had played in the past- Max Payne. I won't go into that movie- that's for a different deal. I saw the original and loved everything about it. The casting, the story, the cinematic artistry and it's gritty noir.

Along came the second movie and my friends didn't want to see it- actually I think it was mainly due to my best friend's gf who is against it- so we didn't go. Anyways, few months roll by, it becomes available to rent on Amazon so I do, and I'm glad I rented before buying. I will definitely NOT be buying A Dame to Kill For.

It took 20-30 minutes of watching the movie to realize a few things. One- like all others said, this movie is a prequel and sequel at the same time at different parts of the movie as it relates to the comic lineage, or so I've read. The other is there were 2 different casting changes, one out of necessity because Michael Clarke Duncan passed away, and as another review stated- ""was replaced by the all state guy"" which yes, he did a decent job at mimicking the role MCD played to perfection, but I kept waiting for insurance deals as well. The second, which really had no excuse, was they recast Clive Owen with Josh Brolin. It took a long time to understand that Dwight was one and the same as in the original. I felt completely robbed as after various research showed, it was basically the timing of the filming and how they couldn't have had at least a cameo in this- well, it robbed us. It was basically like when they released a second Punisher movie without Thomas Jane who played that role to perfection- put in the training and research to do play the role legitly, well- they up and did a sequel of sorts, the story line I read he didn't like, and so they cast some other guy. Wasn't even worth my time to watch and had I realized they swapped out Owen on this, instead of thinking of this as a totally different movie and not a sequel as it apparently was, well- I wouldn't have bothered to watch this.

The story line was alright, the movie was alright, but I'm one of those people who tends to fall in favor of original castings except when something drastic happens like the passing of an actor or jealousy of a supporting actor (:cough: Ironman :cough:). That said- if you're not a Clive Owen fan and you do like Josh Brolin (I'm not a Brolin fan yet, as I haven't really seen him in anything of interest to me), then go check it out! Otherwise be forewarned.",1417564800,2,2627,4.28169014084507

6555582,1,B00M482XH4,"This attempt at film noir failed for me, I hated every one of its 102 minutes - time I will never get back. It was explict, violent, and full of itself- so if that's your thing, this is your kind of  movie.",1417564800,,206,3.9047619047619047
6555583,3,B00M482XH4,"If youve never taken a trip to Sin City then youve missed a location rife with grief, drama, crime and death. Its not a location most would choose, but the characters in author/artist Frank Millers highly acclaimed adult comic book series have no choice. Their lives and loves fit the city and all if offers. Its a black and white world where there are few good guys and even those end up tainted before long. When word came out that the series was being turned into a film fans went wild.

That first movie came out nine years ago and did amazingly well. Directors Robert Rodriguez and Miller brought the page to life by shooting the entire movie using the green screen process where everything is shot on a soundstage before a green screen with all backgrounds and some props inserted by computer. It worked well. Images from the page were literally the exact same on screen. The crispness of the high contrast images was stunning. Sadly it took 9 years for the sequel to come out, SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR. Unfortunately the magic just doesnt quite feel the same.

As any fan will know there isn't a single story involved in these movies. Here we have a lead in story featuring fan fave Mickey Rourke as Marv, the ham fisted, violence prone, hard drinking, scarred boogey man of the city, someone to walk around when seen if not across the street. Marvs story of finding well to do college kids lighting homeless men on fire and taking vengeance sets the tone for the movie. As the title moves from the screen, the next story begins.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Johnny, an amazingly lucky gambler whos come to Sin City to make his mark and to take down the evil and corrupt Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). One should never pull a tiger by the tail and the eventual outcome of this confrontation will not be pretty. Josh Brolin takes over the role of Dwight from Clive Owen, here trying to stay above the fray but drawn back in by the one woman able to seduce him to do her bidding, Ava (Eva Green). Now the wife of another man she draws Dwight back in only to inflict damage on him both physically and mentally. Lastly Jessica Alba returns as Nancy, haunted by images of her defender the deceased Hartigan (Bruce Willis) as she seeks vengeance against the same Roark Johnny set his sights on earlier. Aided by Marv the end result won't be pretty.

This combination of tales from the pages of the comics should play out well on screen, equaling those of the first film. But something just doesnt quite feel right here. The look of the film is done well but perhaps too well. Or maybe its been too long since I watched the first film. Here it feels overused and at times far too stylized for its own good. Its still amazing to see and offers some great moments.

Ive watching it through twice now, once in the theater and now on DVD. This time felt better than the first but still, different from the original. Two reasons seem to stand out in my mind looking back at both viewings. One was the over use of film noir narration, a raspy whisper that comes from almost every character on screen. Its as if one person were telling each story but using a different voice that always sounded similar. Eventually it becomes monotonous.

The second was the fact that it felt like much more attention as paid to sexuality here than in the first film. It did exist in the first but the amount of screen time spent on sexual escapades feels over done here. Ive begun to wonder if Eva Green can be involved in any film that doesnt require her to disrobe every so often. She can be a talented actress but with this film she seems as interested in taking off her clothes as she does at delivering lines. It doesnt enhance her character but actually becomes boring.

On the whole the movie does deliver a couple of good stories, some much better than others and unfortunately the worst taking up most of the screen time. The actors involved all turn in solid performances and while Rourke as Marv is seen in two of those stories you still find yourself wishing he had more time. Brolins take on Dwight doesnt quite equal Owens but he still shows hes become a great actor.

Well done, well made and well acted, the movie is better than some and worse than others, one I can recommend to fans of the first. This is one trip to a bad town that will be more fun for some than others but in the end its like a trip anywhere; its never quite the same once youve already been there.",1417564800,3,4462,4.426309378806334

When I learned of the release of ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" I was overjoyed although a little dubious. More often than not, sequels disappoint. But not so with this sequel. While building on the familiar characters, it introduced a whole new story line that was incredibly compelling.",1416960000,,377,4.7272727272727275

6555664,5,B00M482XH4,"Film noir to the tenth power: That's 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.'
Let's be frank here: This is not a movie for everyone. In typical Frank Miller fashion, the story features a lot of gore interspersed with a lot of sex all brought to life under the skillful - if bloody - hands of Robert Rodriguez.
But if you're a fan of Miller's graphic novels, beautiful women in various stages of undress, tough guys who know how to take a punch, and over-the-top dialogue then you're going to love this movie.
'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' picks up the story started in the original 'Sin City.' Jessica Alba is back to recreate her role as the extremely sexy Nancy Callahan; Mickey Rourke returns as Marv, the human wrecking ball; and Bruce Willis returns as the ghost of Lt. John Hartigan, Nancy's protector and the object of her affection. This second installment in the life and times of the denizens of 'Sin City' also introduces Eva Green as Ava Lord, a scheming and super-sexy woman with an agenda, and gives Joseph Gordon-Levitt a chance to play a cocky young gambler with a talent for winning and a secret. Rosario Dawson, as the leader of a tough female street gang, and Jamie Chung, as her deadliest sister-in-arms, are back as well, dealing sex and death with the skill of a Las Vegas card shark.
As in the original 'Sin City,' there are multiple story lines at play in 'A Dame to Kill For.' Josh Brolin, as Dwight McCarthy, finds himself back in the arms of onetime love Ava Lord; Marv has taken over Hartigan's role as Nancy's protector; Gordon-Levitt is trying to humiliate Sen. Roark at the poker table and Nancy wants to kill the Senator because she blames him for Hartigan's death.
Miller and Rodriguez take these twisted plot lines and smooth them out so that the movie flows seamlessly from one violent encounter to another.
'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' is great cinema and if unclothed women and violence don't disturb your sensibilities, I'm betting you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",1416960000,5,1997,4.5654596100278555

6555675,3,B00M482XH4,"I absolutely adored the original ""Sin City"".  It was unique, well-written, had a true ""all-star"" cast, and was the type of film that you can watch over and over again and still enjoy. So, I was really looking forward to viewing ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"".  What a disappointment!  It was confusing (at least, to the average fan like myself), lacked originality, and, overall, was a 'far cry' from the excellence of the first Sin City.  In fact, it is hard to see the names of Robert Rodriguez and Frank
Miller on a production as mediocre as this one.  Please, don't get me wrong - it is worth watching ONCE. However, don't expect to get the same enjoyment that the first Sin City may have created for you. And...just something to ponder if you do decide to watch this film - did some of the actors who also had roles in the first Sin City have some plastic surgery work done between films?  Deciding this might be the only reason that I would ever watch this movie again!",1416787200,,975,4.388888888888889
6555676,2,B00M482XH4,Was not as enjoyable as the first one.,1416787200,,38,3.875

6555678,4,B00M482XH4,"Let me preface this by saying that I've been a long-time fan of Frank Miller's Sin City comics ever since I randomly found a copy of ""The Big Fat Kill"" at my local public library back when I was in high school. Of course, I was overjoyed and blown away by the faithful, innovative first film adaptation way back in 2005, so by the time 2014 rolled around, I was highly excited that the long-delayed sequel would finally be released.

However, I was disappointed and upset that, due to critical disappointment and poor box office performance (enough to consider it a bomb), ""A Dame to Kill For"" was yanked from theaters after only three weeks. I didn't get it; the trailer looked spectacular. What exactly was turning people off of this one?  (The most common complaint I'd heard, other than that it was ""empty,"" ""lacking the impact of the first,"" and ""style over substance,"" was that ""it was too much like the first one,"" which I didn't buy as a criticism. If you loved the first one, why would you want anything different from the sequel? Ah, but I digress.)

I was burning with curiosity to see what all the negativity was about, but fortunately, they chose to release the movie on DVD just a few months after its initial theater release. Within the last week, I finally got my hands on the Blu-Ray release and watched it. That said, even as a loyal follower, I can now admit that ""A Dame to Kill For"" is not nearly as good as the first movie, but it's still required viewing for anyone who is a fan of the comics or the series in general. Here are my thoughts.

The Good: Let me just say that the ""Dame to Kill For"" segment is clearly the crown jewel in this set of stories and the biggest reason to watch the film. By itself, this tale is meaty, satisfying, and very much the same kind of material that pleased viewers of the first movie. Eva Green is the biggest treat here, diving into her role as the heartless seductress Ava Lord with gusto. She oozes sexuality in every frame but also chills the viewer with her icy drive to dominate men and obtain power at any cost. Josh Brolin, too, is a fine replacement for Clive Owen as Dwight, a strong, sometimes violent man who is unable to disentangle himself from Ava's vicious wiles.

Really, the all-star cast is one of the best things the movie has going for it. In addition to Green and Brolin, Dennis Haysbert slips perfectly into the role as the otherworldly Manute, still looking imposing due to camera trickery despite being physically much smaller than the late Michael Clarke Duncan. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also brings his A-game to the table as the cocky and perpetually-lucky gambler Johnny, bursting with as much charisma and youthful arrogance as he can muster. Powers Boothe gets more of an opportunity this time to steal the show as the corrupt and vicious Senator Roark. And, of course, you can't go wrong with a little more Marv in your life; Mickey Rourke nabs a lot of screen time as everyone's favorite urban warrior and perpetual protector of women everywhere. Jamie Chung, Christopher Meloni, Juno Temple, Ray Liotta, Jeremy Piven, Rosario Dawson, Stacy Keach, Bruce Willis, Lady Gaga, Christopher Lloyd, Julia Garner, and Martin Csokas all make fun and enjoyable appearances to round off the sprawling cast.

And let's not forget the eye-popping visuals, one of the first things that I noticed watching the trailer when it was first released. The first movie was no slouch when it came to bringing Frank Miller's uniquely-visual source material to life, and the sequel doesn't disappoint; in fact, the visuals here look twice as brilliant in my opinion. (Let's chalk this up to a decade's worth of progress in special effects technology as well as a much higher budget than the first movie.)

Ava Lord's stunning blue dress, red lips, and green eyes pop against the film's classic black-and-white palette (now dashed with a more striking contrast, some backgrounds even looking shiny and silver now); streams of stark-white blood and faceless severed heads fly about against black backgrounds as Miho storms Ava's mansion; and even something as playing cards appear stunning as Johnny shuffles his glowing deck and passes cards around the table. Prosthetics are effective, too, bringing notably-deformed characters like Marv, Wallenquist, and Manute to life.

The Bad: With so much going for ""A Dame to Kill For,"" it still didn't leave me as completely satisfied as the first ""Sin City."" I've thought about it for a few days, and here's what I've concluded. The first movie had its pick of three of the best and most engrossing graphic novels in the Sin City series, so naturally its intertwining narratives packed one hell of a punch. This time around, ""A Dame to Kill For"" is the only story that has been adapted from one of the original graphic novels; the other three, ""Just Another Saturday Night,"" ""The Long Bad Night,"" and ""Nancy's Last Dance"" are either adapted from short stories or were written specifically for the film.

I can forgive ""Just Another Saturday Night"" for being on the slight side since it's simply meant to kick off the movie on the right note (along the same lines as ""The Customer is Always Right"" from the first movie), but ""The Long Bad Night"" and ""Nancy's Last Dance,"" while fun and entertaining, just aren't as developed or involving as any of Frank Miller's full-length works, leaving the movie feeling woefully uneven. At over 20 minutes shorter than the first movie, there definitely seems to be a lot missing in the story department.

""The Long Bad Night"" had a big opportunity to make a satisfying conclusion as Johnny seeks revenge against Roark's punishment for besting him at cards, but the ending they chose, while decent, just doesn't hit as hard as the typical Sin City yarn. ""Nancy's Last Dance,"" while an interesting return to the now-tortured and revenge-obsessed Nancy, is also lacking. Jessica Alba, who I've never cared much for as an actress, does an arguably better job here with almost a decade of experience under her belt and the chance to really push the character in new directions, but the story itself seems rather perfunctory and slap-dash. Most of all, there's a strong hint of the supernatural during the climax of ""Last Dance"" that I didn't buy for a second. The Sin City series, while sometimes hard to take as totally realistic with bizarre characters like Manute and Yellow Bastard, has never allowed room for the paranormal.

 I now wonder if perhaps these stories would have fared better if they had figured out a way to combine them, with both Johnny and Nancy teaming up with their shared goal at getting back at the villainous Senator Roark. I guess we'll never know... (Lastly, as a much, much smaller complaint, Josh Brolin just looks silly with his ""new,"" longer hair after his facial reconstruction later in the movie. With Brolin's older, craggier features, the two don't match up. But this is tiny compared to my bigger grievances.)

This movie makes me happy and sad at the same time. As a long-time fan of the series, I'm glad to see the characters again and experience some new material, but this movie just wasn't as good it could have been. In addition, with as badly as ""A Dame to Kill For"" did at the box office, I'm thinking this may be the last time we'll ever see Basin City and its seedy inhabitants on the silver screen (unless Robert Rodriguez gets crafty and maybe gets a Kickstarter pledge drive going to fund the last big Sin City story left, ""Hell and Back""). Still, at least we got one good sequel made when it seemed like it would never crawl out of development hell, and when you consider how faithful both movies have been to the original comic series, I guess we fans should consider ourselves awfully lucky. Maybe we'll get dealt a better hand in the future if a third entry ever comes to light...",1416787200,17,7871,4.732312180889862
6555679,2,B00M482XH4,"This movie is stylish and unique visually, but the story is all over the place.  It jumps around and explains so little, as if it were written by an ADHD squirrel who drank too much soda.  And what a terrible loss to us!  Sin City 2 is PACKED with talent.  Mickey Rourke's character alone should have his own movie.  Everybody starring in this debacle can pull his or her own weight and then some!  Fantastic actors in a horrible story.  Couldn't even finish it.

AVOID.  This movie is confusing--and not worth figuring out.  I can get the same experience by rolling around in a dumpster filled with newspapers.

6555689,4,B00M482XH4,"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a follow-up to Sin City, the 2005 picture based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. The script blends several overlapping stories and characters. Returning from the previous film are Marv (Mickey Rourke), Hartigan (Bruce Willis) as a ghost, sadistic crime boss Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), and stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba). New characters are cocky gambler Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Dwight (Josh Brolin), a sort of unofficial private detective who takes compromising photos for his clients.

Johnny gets into a high-stakes poker game with Roark and wins big. Showing up Roark in front of his associates is an offense that will cost Johnny dearly. As Johnny and Marcie, a gal hes picked up, walk down the dark streets of Sin City, they're attacked by two of Roarks thugs. Johnny beats the assailants senseless. But Roarks enmity doesnt end there.

Nancy, a good girl gone wrong, is still a stripper, but no longer just for the joy of stripping. She bides her time, waiting to exact revenge on a horrible person from her past.

Eva Lord (Eva Green) is the ultimate femme fatale, using her body and sensuality to lure men to their doom. She dumped Dwight years ago but now wants him back in a plot to kill her rich husband. She seems to enjoy flaunting her inherent evil. Ms. Green is frequently nude as she seduces one guy after another. She is the dame worth killing for in the films title.

Director Robert Rodriguez concentrates on the visceral. His film has a cold, unemotional feel. It contains stock noir types: prostitutes, detectives, chiselers, crooked cops, lethal women, and hard-boiled thugs. The environment has hardened and jaded its inhabitants. There are no ordinary folks in Sin City. Everyone is damaged, physically or psychologically.

Gordon-Levitt is a welcome addition to the grim world of Sin City. We sense that Johnnys going up against Roark can only lead to a bad outcome, yet we root for him anyway. Though hes not exactly a hero, hes as close to it as director Rodriguez permits in his shadowy, underbelly world of misfits.

Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, rated R, looks great but moves sluggishly and fails to recapture the excitement of its predecessor. It wallows in violence, gore, and cynicism as it portrays the dark doings in a town rife with lawlessness and corruption.

I am a hard-of-hearing guy who enjoys 3D movies and I use the subtitles to help understand what's being said. Sin City: A Dame to Kill for is a very heavily narriated film noir/ comic movie. There is a lot of narriation and monologues going on where you can't read lips.

About 99% of the 3D movies DO include the subtitles on the 3D edition. This one does NOT. When I buy a move that says it is 3D Blu-Ray/ Blu-Ray/ DVD and it says it is subtittled. I expect all of the editions of the movies included to have the subtitles. Not that only the regular Blu-Ray and DVD versions will have subtitles.

The one star is for the false advertising of the subtititles for the 3D edition.

Eva Green is worth the price of admission, all by herself, in anything, but the multiple plots don't dovetail in the same way as before.
I suppose we get some ""closure"" - almost meaningless word - by the ending here, but it isn't weighted in the same way. Defeat and fatigue are not inappropriate for the characters and the story, but I hope the director doesn't share them.

Not a word seems genuine, this could be part of the film's distinct feel, but after awhile it becomes cloying, than comical, painful and irredemably destructive to the film's quality.
  As in the first picture this installment drips Noir atmosphere to the point of parody and as the 102 minute duration goes on and nears its climax, with a continued sense of a lagging pace and scenes being drug out, it becomes very apparent there is a serious lack of story here. What little narrative it has ultimately descends into repetition of its former ideas in its later scenes. Though the structure remains intriguing at times it runs on fumes early and sputters, with only some fair bits of grisly action (none of which we haven't seen ad nauseum but are in true Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez style) to give it a hiccup of life, to its routine conclusion.
  At least it doesn't overstay its welcome and still leaves you wanting more. Nowadays that is saying quite a bit but when all is said and done I didn't regret sitting through it and think that for serious filmgoers its worth viewing for the unique experience of the visuals alone.",1416441600,3,1598,4.628975265017668

6555721,4,B00M482XH4,Liked this movie a lot.  Figured it got bad reviews because it was seen by reviewers who hadn't seen the first movie.  This isn't one of those films that you can see with out seeing the first one and know what's going on.,1416441600,,221,4.116279069767442
6555722,2,B00M482XH4,"Sin City has it's moments. Mickey Rourke is the high point of the story. Somehow the hero from the first story has committed suicide and you're never told why. Thanks, Rodriguez. Some of the effects are cool, but then you are thrown out of the story by how cheesy or fake other effects are. Thanks, Rodriguez. Frank miller is amazing and does great dialogue for graphic novels. But this isn't a graphic novel. It's great dialogue cheesed out by Rodriguez, a director proud of cutting corners.

It was cool. The 3D was very beliveable in the opening but faded-unfortunately.

Powers Booth shined as the criminally insane senator. Mickey Roarke was cool as the big jawed dude.
The new Ed Reimers for All State was a surprise. Awesome and very strong talent here.

I know in my heart that this graphic novel motion picture was based upon true events in some stoner's head.

Eva Green is hot as usual. See her in Penny Dreadful on Showtime.",1416355200,,547,4.561224489795919
6555724,3,B00M482XH4,Same visuals as Sin City but the story wasn't as compelling.  Boothe Powers was as evil as ever and the actress who was the chief antagonist in movie (name escapes) has several nude scenes that are worth renting the movie for just for those scenes. Mickey Rourke's character wasn't as menacing.  Josh Brolin was good.  And I know Jessica Alba isn't going to do any nude scenes but you can't have as a stripper when she doesn't strip anything off.  See the first Sin City to have a better understanding of what's going on in this second move.  Stunning visuals.,1416355200,,560,4.56

Plus the one thing a lot of us have to remember this takes place four yrs after the yellow bastard so you all should know that this sin won't be the same as the first . there's got  to be changes and that's a thing we all must deal with",1416268800,,668,3.638888888888889

One of the greatest bodies in Hollywood on display, without clothes.  She looks awesome and does act very well.  Then we have a plethora of stars in various roles.  Action, some drama, gore, classic cars, and special effects.  So for sheer entertainment,  this is a great movie.  Whether it follows the comics or not is irrelevant.  Of late, which Marvel movie followed the comics?  Yet, they rake in the money.  I go to be entertained and this did.  To me, the ending was sad, as I'd want Eva to show up in the next installment, much like the evil villain that continues to wreck havoc on the lives of the characters.  just my two cents.",1416268800,2,754,4.496296296296296

6555734,3,B00M482XH4,"As with many other reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Sin City and, although A Dame To Kill For, has some of the same characters and feel, it is lost in a chronological mish-mash that makes this movie 2nd at best and closer to 3rd or 4th. Supposedly 4 years after Hartigan kills himself to protect Nancy and Marv has died in the electric chair, the only ghost is Hartigan. WTH? It seems many of these stories, like Dwight and Ava, happened long before the first outing of SIN CITY where he returns with a new face because of what happened in the past, and likely what happened in this particular past that is now 4 years later. Not cool and not good plotting and planning.

The rest of the story is pure SIN CITY as is Nancy's decline into alcoholism and regret and anger at Hartigan's suicide, no matter the reason. He lied to her. Of course someone has to take Nancy in hand and teach her to kill and Marv is the perfect guy for the job, but he's 4 years dead. Manute, aptly played by Michael Clark Duncan and just as menacing and mean with Dennis Haysbert, had his golden eye (ooh, shades of James Bond) 4 years ago and he gets it again when Marv takes it out after a bloody bashing. Are there two Manutes or are we in yet another slipstream where time runs backward and forward? Roark's son Ethan is dead, killed by Hartigan, and that does track even with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Roark's latest bastard come to town. The girls of Old Town are still killer, but there is definitely a problem with time and timing, especially since Goldie (who is4 years dead, along with Marv) and her sister appear to take Dwight's life, although Gail forbids it.

This mish-mash of times and characters is worth seeing, but don't expect it to be as good as the original SIN CITY or follow any kind of logical time line and character plots. Enjoy it for what it is -- b/w with some color noir trying to piggyback a few bucks on the original outing.",1416182400,,1941,4.373961218836565

Ava (Green) is a beautiful woman who can manipulate any man she wants into doing anything she wants them to do. These and other stories come alive and prove that once again Sin City isn't a place you want to be. I have to start by saying that I wasn't a big fan of the first one. I thought it looked cool and was original but that was about it. It may be because I was never a huge comic book fan and all that was was a live action comic book. I wasn't looking forward to this one but sat down hoping I would be surprised. What I found was that this was just about the same as the first one. This movie looks very cool but I just had a hard time getting into it. I really think that fans of the first one will love this. I wasn't all that into the first one and I wasn't all that into this one. Overall, a movie that looks spectacular (amazing in 3D) but the visuals can only take things so far for me.

I may had not enjoyed it as much in the theater b/c of the mood I was in of something? BUT today I re watched it at home on the day of it's street date, and found it much better. Maybe even as good as the original! They really AMPED up the visuals in this one. Making it even more like the graphic novels. I did make me FEEL a little disturbed at times, but I think that's part of these films. I never felt that with Sin City 2005. I more wanted to be like MARV. I was much younger then. But this film was right up my ally! If I was to get a wild hair to watch a Sin City. I would more than likely put this one in. Since I've seen Sin City 2005 100 times. In fact I would watch Sin City, Sin City a dame to KILL for, and the Spirit. Since I feel they could be seen as part of the same world!

Just a quick review to offer the following - if you loved the original Sin City, you will love this one as well. They kept the same feel and dialogue and pacing as the first film, without missing a step. It truly is a sequel that I feel maintains the integrity of the first and isn't a blatant money grab that sacrifices any of the things that made the experience of the first film so amazing. Frank Miller's graphic novels are well represented in this first film and equally so in A Dame to Kill For.

Plus, if you enjoy Marv, you'll really dig this one.

I ended up renting this, then enjoyed it so much, I bought it as a digital download. Since then I've watched it 5 or 6 times and really found it worth the price of admission. :)",1415750400,4,753,4.1438356164383565
6555758,5,B00M482XH4,"The sequence was spectacular ... especially as it followed the story line of the original Sin City. However, I was extremely disappointed that after pre-ordering and purchasing this title and finally available, I found out that I could not add it to my home library since there was no way to download it.

6555760,3,B00M482XH4,"The first Sin City movie was fantastic-- the over-the-top film-noir style (especially the narration) that somehow fit perfectly without being cheesy, the comic book visuals, the gruesome wit, and the larger-than-life characters. Like many fans of Sin City, my favorite character was Marv. When I heard that they were bringing him back to life for this one, I was skeptical but tentatively optimistic.

I was wrong. This time around, various main characters use him (often by misleading him) to do their dirty work. Marv went from being a complex 3-dimensional character to a dull wrecking ball/deus ex machina. Unfortunately, like Marv, most of the characters from the original film that show up in ""A Dame to Kill For"" are terribly boring this time around. The 2 most interesting characters in this movie are new ones, and we don't get to spend enough time with them (especially Joseph Gordon Levitt's character).

If you were a fan of the first film, you can probably enjoy this one if your expectations aren't too high. If you weren't, skip it for sure.",1415577600,2,1056,4.926966292134831

The sequel picks right up where the original had put closure ( or so we thought) to the original characters who are unsettled and itching to get back in the game in ""Old Town."" Millers' pulp fiction style narrative is very Noiresque in its hard boiled talk and expressions.  The men are tough and the women protect them from danger, yeah you heard that right.  A game of power, greed, and revenge served up smoking hot will keep you engaged with eyes glued to the screen from start to end. It is must viewing. Enjoy.",1415491200,,609,4.4774774774774775

It doesn't come close to the first film.  But, for a sequel,  it does it's job well.  It seems pretty common these days for people to expect so much from something,  whether it be music, film, or even video games.  The longer the production and development cycles, people are going to expect a product with expectations so high that it can never live up to.  If you can get over the fact that it took nine years for this film to see the light of day, maybe you will enjoy it as well.

Trying to compare this and the first film is pointless.  You will like it, or you won't.  Just don't let the hype cloud your judgements on it.  It's a good film.

6555764,4,B00M482XH4,"You don't have to have seen SIN CITY (2005) in order to enjoy its follow-up, SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR (2014).  In fact, not having seen it will probably make viewing this new film more entertaining since you won't be wondering how characters who were killed in the first movie are back in this one, which is part sequel, part prequel and part something else.

That said, like its predecessor,  SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR is a visual delight, Frank Millers graphic novel brought to life.  Its filled with stylized ultra-violent action and a pair of compelling storylines of sex, murder and betrayal that will please all lovers of film noir.  Like the graphic novel, the images are essentially black-and-white with bold color accents (e.g. eye color, a dress, explosions and, particularly, blood) thrown in on a regular basis.

Many characters from the first movie are back in this one.  Some roles are being played by the original actors (Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis, Powers Boothe, Rosario Dawson), while others have been recast.  New cast members include Josh Brolin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Dennis Haysbert, Christopher Meloni and Eva Green, who plays the title role.

Co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR has been released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  The disc contains several enlightening behind-the-scenes featurettes , which demonstrate how the film was shot entirely using the green process.

6555765,2,B00M482XH4,"This review is for the film alone not the video release.  In 2005 when I saw Sin City I was blown away.  It was noir, it was comic book, it was several familiar things but was also something brand new.  Something I had never seen on screen before.  I loved it.  The style and storytelling devices blended perfectly.  I'm sorry to say that the follow up- Sin City: A Dame to Kill For just doesn't work the way the first film did.  In this case they just couldn't catch lightening in a bottle again.  The cast was fine, I loved seeing the returning characters especially, but the way it plays with time was a bit confusing.  There was a degree of that in the first film but I'd put that together before the midway point.  You see, A Dame to Kill For is both a sequel and prequel to the stories in the first movie.  This confused me for a while, then I started to realize that some of what  I was watching took place before some events on the first set of stories, while some were after.  Once I got that I didn't mind but I think it took me too long to ""get it"".  Maybe that's my problem.  Could be, but I would have been able to engage in the stories easier had I been given more clues sooner.  Even after I ""got it"" I was never really drawn into the narratives like I had in the first one.  In my opinion Sin City felt like stories that Frank Miller came up with and HAD to tell, A Dame to Kill For felt more like stories that Frank Miller felt obligated to come up with in order to have enough material for another film.  There are some really nice moments and scenes in this movie but over all it just doesn't have the style, flow, and engaging stories that the first did.  There were a couple of cast changes in this one in regards to returning characters.  Due to the death of Michael Clark Duncan, his character Manute, the chauffeur/bodyguard was played by Dennis Haysbert.  While Haysbert has a great voice he just doesn't have the physical presence that Duncan did.  Another casting change was Josh Brolin taking over from Clive Owen the role of Dwight.  In this case there is an explanation in the story.  I also think there was more killing for the sake of killing in this movie.  Sin City was violent, but I always felt that it was warranted.  Here it felt gratuitous at times.  A Dame to Kill For just does not live up to the pedigree of the first movie.  Too bad 'cause it really could become an awesome series if the passion were still there.",1414281600,41,2456,4.234913793103448
6555766,4,B00M482XH4,"Ok, 1st thing 1st. You have to understand, this is not the first sin city. This movie has different characters, but the style and ambiance is similar. Again its black and white with great use of color to highlight violence and mood. This flick is dark and violent, same as the original. I liked it a lot. My only gripe is they over-used Marv. Granted Marv IS my favorite character, but I feel Sin City works the best when you leave the audience wanting more, not satiating them.

At any rate, this is a dark, fun, violent movie, full of Frank Miller nostalgia. Many people will dislike it simply because it isn't the original, but I contend, if this movie came out 1st, people would still rant and rave about it. Its only flaw is that is came out too long after the first one, and may have suffered in star power, but all the actors did do a great job. I don't have any complaints.

A dark, violent, disturbed, fun flick. If that isn't your cup of tea, don't bother. But hell, for me, I wish there where more. Oh, and Alba is still hot!",1414108800,2,1036,4.280612244897959
6555767,4,B00M482XH4,"Again, Eva Green owns yet another character and makes me forget everything else going on. I think I could watch her just sitting on a chair doing absolutely nothing for two hours and still be riveted. My Eva obsession aside, this was overall a solid movie. If you didn't see the first one you would be clueless. Obviously, it is a sequel but many sequels today can act as stand alone pieces, this, however, is not one of them. The best thing about A Dame to Kill For, is Eva Green and Jessica Alba. The feel of the movie was the same as the first film however, this movie felt less connected in all of its story lines than the first Sin City film. That was the reason I gave this 4 stars but I would give it 4.5 if the rating allowed. I wanted to love it because I loved the first one but I could not quite get there. Maybe watching it again I will feel different about the overall story. Since I know what to expect I can relax and enjoy it more.",1411689600,3,947,4.096774193548387
6555768,1,B00M482XH4,"Overlong, shockingly tedious sequel to Sin City is probably the most boring movie filled with dismemberments, exploding body parts and nudity that you will ever see.  The individual segments move so slowly it feels like you are watching a movie in slow motion after a while.  Even the return of Mickey Rourke as Marve, the undisputed highlight of the first film doesn't help.  Only Eve Green as the titular dame to die for and a too brief appearance from Juno Temple keeps this movie from being a complete bomb.  Well, it is a little better than Frank Miller's Spirit movie, but that's faint praise at best.  The long, endless downward spiral of Robert Rodriguez's career continues.",1411603200,11,682,4.844827586206897
6555769,3,B00M482XH4,"What it's about?

More intertwining stories from Basin sin City. In black and white. With OTT violence and sexual themes.

What did I think?

The sequel is almost exactly the same as the first in both style and general narrative technique. In fact, while some would say it should embrace what set it apart, you're left feeling its actually far too similar and instead of a fresh continuation its almost a rehash. Its certainly still enjoyable but Miller and Rodriguez seem to have sacrificed the grit for some average one liners and far more two-dimensional characters.

Fans of the original will still have fun with this romp but it ends up running 20 minutes too long and there actually may be a bit too much nudity (something I thought Id never write  but its probably a reflection of the sameness of it) though it has to be said Eva Green yet again steals the show.

6555770,5,B00M482XH4,"I don't know why this bombed... personally I thought it was amazing! I loved the first one, and I've been eagerly awaiting the sequel for years. I went to see this with my brother and we both came up with a few reasons we believe may have contributed to the negative reviews: First, the sequel seemed allot more fast paced than the first movie, the stories weren't as detailed as the original. Second, the placement of the stories in the Sin City timeline seemed a bit confusing. I know the story with Marv was suppose to be a prequel, but they didn't really explain that too well, so it could have been confusing to some moviegoer's. Plus, just the way Rodriguez edited them seemed somewhat rushed. Lastly, the sequel didn't feature two of the (in my opinion) best actors (besides Mickey Rourke) in the movie. Josh Hartnett's character in the first movie served as bookends, and definitely made the film more detailed and interesting. It would have been awesome to see more of that character and his story. Also, Clive Owen is an amazing actor and should have been brought back for the Dwight character. I know he is suppose to have a new face in the original, but they could have used prosthetic's for him before the surgery, like they did for Josh Brolin in the sequel. I think those two actors sort of classed up the movie, and not having them in the cast, plus changing the actor playing Miho... I think definitely contributed to the film bombing at the box office. But, these are just my thoughts on why I think people didn't resonate with the sequel. Personally, I loved the movie and will absolutely be buying the Blu Ray.",1410825600,2,1630,4.566552901023891

I will order my blue-ray copy as soon as get released.",1410220800,,324,4.241935483870968
6555772,4,B00M482XH4,"At this point everyone hates Frank Miller.  You hate Frank Miller.  I hate Frank Miller.  All your friends hate Frank Miller.  Your grandmother, if she knows who he is, probably hates Frank Miller too.  After many years of contributing to the development of American comic books, Millers talent and credibility hit a serious wall sometime in the 21st century.  His output has been so bad that people have started to wonder whether or not he was ever talented.  To top it all off, in addition to putting out lazily written drivel, he also released a bizarre anti-Occupy Wall Street rant that fully revealed his inner neocon.  Millers politics were never exactly subtlein fact, if one of his characters came upon nuance, he would have likely socked it in the jawbut there was a certain complexity to his political positions, which often camped out somewhere in the borderlands where liberals and libertarians have achieved an uneasy truce.  So judging merely by Millers involvement, there was little reason to be optimistic about a long delayed sequel to the original Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller collaboration, Sin City.

But, surprisingly, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For has turned out to be a worthy sequel to the stylish and brutal original.  Despite the diminishing quality of both Miller and Rodriguezs work in recent years, there must be something about working together that brings out the best in both artists.  Like the first movie, A Dame to Kill For is split into several distinct but vaguely interrelated tales.  Two of the films stories, the eponymous A Dame to Kill For and Just Another Saturday Night, are taken straight from Millers funny books where the other two, The Long Bad Night and Nancys Last Dance, were written by Miller exclusively for the film.  The events of Dame occur before and after the events of the first film, making it a sort of pre-sequel and allowing Miller and Rodriguez to resurrect fan favorite characters like Marv.

Just Another Saturday Night is little more than a cynical smirk of a story that serves to set the stage for the rest.  The films meatiest tale is the titular Dame to Kill For.  Taking over for Clive Owen, Josh Brolin plays Dwight who gets pulled back into a world of seduction and double crosses by his old flame, Ava.  Played by Eva Green in various stages of undress (shes French), Ava is the femme fatale turned up to eleven.  Able to transform herself into varying female archetypes so she fits the desires of any single man, Ava is a consummate manipulator.

The femme fatale standard is highly problematic, but in certain films she has been made to symbolize female agency within a patriarchal world.  It would be difficult to redeem Ava, and theres no confusing the writing of Frank Miller for a feminist treatise, but Im not quite willing to call Miller an outright misogynist.  (Perhaps Avas ability to transform herself is a critique of the kinds of boxes men wish to box women into?)  And to complicate matters somewhat, A Dame to Kill For brings back the women of Old Town, an area of Sin City controlled and policed by its resident prostitutes.  If anything, A Dame to Kill For arguably tests the limits of third-wave feminism.

The two stories written specifically for Dame feel a little trim compared to those first written for the page.  In the first Sin City, there was a sense that each individual yarn could have been expanded into its own film, which is not the case in the sequel.  The Long Bad Night follows the preternaturally lucky Johnny (Joseph Gordon Levitt) as he weasels his way into a high stakes card game and makes enemies of the unrelenting big bad, Senator Roarke (played with gusto once again by Powers Boothe).  I naturally love the noir inspired irony that for someone with unerring luck, Johnny still has a horrendous time in Sin City.  (I also thoroughly enjoyed the scene stealing cameo from Christopher Lloyd.)  By contrast, Nancys Last Dance, a more direct sequel to the first film, suffers somewhat.  The story of Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) and her attempt to avenge the death of police officer and her savior, John Hartigan, played once again by Bruce Willis, only this time, well, dead, seems too undercooked to have much of an impact.

If A Dame to Kill For lacks some of the more memorable elements of the originala dead Benecio Del Toro speaking from the grave while part of a gun sticks out from his head or Elijah Woods trophy roomeach story seems to slide into the next more easily for a more cohesive whole.  Plenty of critics have claimed the film has come too late and audiences are used to its box of tricks by now.  I impolitely disagree.  Dame may not be as good as the first film, but I think it injects something much needed into todays genre of comic book movies: a sense of visual experimentation.

Here Rodriguez expands on what he accomplished in the original film, mixing in metaphorical images of a tiny Johnny sliced apart by Rourke or staging a car chase around Marvs head as he remembers what happened earlier in the night.  If anything, todays comic book films are far more conservative visually then they were a decade ago or more ago.  Marvel, the most financially successful maker of comic book films, appears to be uninterested in fusing the distinct visuals of film and comic books lest it muss up their plans for franchise domination.  (I wouldnt be surprised if this was part of the reason for the departure of Edgar Wright, a unique visual stylist, from Ant Man).  Compare the relatively safe imagery of the Marvel films to the hyperkinetic camera movement of Sam Raimis Spider-Man movies, or the disorienting use or split screen in Ang Lees Hulk, or, to stretch back farther, the infusion of German Expressionism into Tim Burtons Batman films.  Hell, even the now forgotten 90s superhero film The Shadow has some wonderfully bizarre imagery that would be deemed too out there in 2014.  Im a fan of Marvels movies, but Im also somewhat nostalgic for that period of time in the aughts when comic books were providing a new template for what was possible in Hollywood films.  In 2005, the original Sin City seemed like the culmination of a series of experiments, but in 2014, A Dame to Kill For seems wholly singular.",1410220800,,6257,4.7439926062846585
6555773,2,B00M482XH4,"When Sin City came out back in 2005, it was a major hit. It had a lot of the whos who of action movies, excellent stories, and seemed to transcend being a bloody tale and actual was quality cinema. Jump ahead to 2014 and two of the first movies actors have died, one got replaced, and honestly as you watch you almost feel like maybe you should have watched the first one again just to remind yourself of what is going on. Though the real question is: is Sin City: A Dame to Kill For worth the 9 year wait?

Characters & Story

The film mixes 2-3 short stories of which Marv (Mickey Rourke) is the one who connects all of them. Starting from worse story to best: you have Nancys (Jessica Alba) story which deals with her wanting revenge for John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) death in the first movie, as well as what she went through as a kid; Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) going up against Senator Rorke (Powers Boothe) in order to not only best him, and embarrass him, but make him remember his existence; and then there is Dwight (Josh Brolin) and the femme fatale Ava Lord (Eva Green) who gets him mixed up in some serious drama. These combination of stories, which mostly take place in the present, though Dwights in the past, all create a bloody tale in which mutilation and bullets are the mainstay.

Praise

If you are the type of person who likes loads of violence, a good amount of nudity, and that is all you really want is some violent bloody fantasy, then youll love this movie. Especially if you are the type who love machismo men, who mostly look like action stars from the 80s and back, fighting it out, fist to face, gun in hand, or even with blade in hand. Then, when it comes to your women, you want them bad ass, but still made for male consumption. Im talking about women who are either scantily clad or nude, the ones who no matter who dangerous they are, or seem, they never become equals to the men when it comes to story. If that is what you like, youll love Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.

But, sarcasm aside, when it comes to the film I must admit I did like Johnnys story going against Senator Rorke for what little edge Gordon-Levitt has as an actor, he uses it to his full capabilities. Then with Dwight and Avas story, Green makes the perfect femme fatale and really plays up her sexuality to the point you may even feel seduced by her. And quite honestly, I feel that if more movies were willing to be VoD, and be less than 90 minutes, I think that story could have made a good mini-movie, with some things changed.

Criticism

However, largely youll find in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For that all the compelling stories you may have expected to see, due to what we got in the original, are watered down to fit in more fight scenes and more sexual content. Of which both are shoved down your throat so much that pretty much a quarter of your way through the film you will be so desensitized to it that it makes the issues of the story blaring obvious.

Take for example Jessica Alba, who is but a pretty face who hardly justifies such a large role in the film. If just because, even after 9 years, she hasn't proved herself to really be made to be anything besides the hot girlfriend. So with this meaty role, honestly it feels wasted on her. Especially since her role isn't a supporting one in the first movie, and while Marv tries to Nancy not seem like a tool, Albas acting makes that situation a real uphill battle.

Though it isn't just Nancy story which is an issue, but also trying to tie all three of the films stories with Marv in the middle. For while Marv remains an interesting character, he isn't so good that he can connect the horrible Nancy story, to the decent Johnny story, and then Dwights and make it all seem like one coherent movie. For he isn't the star, he is a supporting player in each story.

But perhaps one of the most glaring issues is that the story doesnt get better with time, if anything it starts at its peak, with Dwight and Ava, and gets progressively worse. For with Johnny and then Nancys stories following, and them all not taking place simultaneously in the film, it makes it so you can clearly see the film degrade. To the point where the credits hit, you are glad it is over for you pretty much have been looking at your watch for a good hour or so.

Overall: Skip It

Unless you really want to see what Eva Greens breasts looks like in 2014, or like seeing Black and White violence, I honestly don't know why you want to see this. It lacks the style and type of story which made the first film a hit, and really after 9 years this is truly a disappointment. To the point that it truly seems like the type of film which because a contract was signed, and there was an assumption money could be made, that is why it was released. Which would explain, at least in my area, why seeing this film in 2D was difficult. They probably knew it was bad so they opted for as many 3D showings as possible so it can make some sort of money.",1410048000,7,4995,4.290870488322717
6555774,3,B00M482XH4,"I'm just going to start out by saying that it is quite difficult for me to be objective when it comes to Frank Miller, I am a very big fan of his work and love just about everything he does. I got a kick out of All Star Batman and Robin, viewing it a satire that nobody got, consider Holy Terror a decent book that was doomed to hate from the get go and I say without a trace of irony that I find The Spirit to be an excellent film. That being said, when it comes to Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, after I walked out of the theatre I found myself disappointed. I didn't see the original Sin City in theaters, I was but eleven years old and didn't even know it existed at the time, but a few years ago I watched it and fell in love. Sin City is an excellent movie and one of the best in the medium, responsible for showing Hollywood that comic book films can be made. It's not fair to compare the sequel to the original's legacy and impact considering that it's nine years later, but I had certain expectations that I hoped would have been met and unfortunately A Dame to Kill For was not all I had thought it'd be cracked up to be.
Now my main gripe with the film is that compared to the original, A Dame to Kill For just seems toned down in really everything. Sure, there's violence and the seediness of its characters, but it all just seems dialed back, particularly in the sections with Marv doing what he does best. There may be many who disagree with me, but I consider it all dialed back, with the notable exception of whenever Miho is in action with her swords however, those parts are up to snuff in my book. That being said, the sexiness of Sin City is well intact, Jessica Alba is fantastic as Nancy, expressing raw sexuality and emotion, a woman at the end of her rope. Rosario Dawson in the small part she plays is her usual gorgeous self, though I consider her under-used. Another scene or three with her would have been lovely. As for the Dame to Kill For herself, Eva Green positively steals the show in every scene she is in and it goes without saying that her sex appeal has very few peers. Eva spends very little time on screen wearing clothes, not that many would complain about that, but it is a little over-done I'd say, not even in the book was Eva Lord naked that often. (But of course my memory could be a little fuzzy) The story itself runs a bit fast and I'm not convinced that Josh Brolin was an adequate replacement for Clive Owen, but it was still a good yarn faithfully adapted from the book.
A Dame to Kill For is divided into four stories: Just Another Saturday Night, The Long Bad Night (Parts I and II), A Dame to Kill For and Nancy's Last Dance. The story that gets the most screen time is of course the same as the title, but my personal favorite has to be The Long Bad Night, with the other show-stealer of the film being Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Johnny, a cocky young gambler. Johnny experiences a long bad night, as the title states and boy is it one for the books. That's what happens when you decide to challenge and beat a Rourke at his own game, you're going to be in a rough time. The Long Bad Night also features appearances by (slight spoilers) Doc Brown himself, Christopher Lloyd as a drugged out doctor and Lady Gaga of all people, as a sympathetic waitress in a diner. I know what you might be thinking, Lady Gaga in a movie? Seriously? But believe me when I tell you, she was great in the small role she had to play, I hope to see her again on the big screen soon.
In Nancy's Last Dance, it's four years on from the events of That Yellow Bastard and Nancy is just barely holding herself together, consumed with grief and the want for revenge over the death of John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) at the close of That Yellow Bastard. She still the main attraction at Kadie's Bar, but she downs more liquor than Marv to drown her sorrows, she's trying to build the courage to put a bullet in the brain of Senator Rourke (played brilliantly by Powers Boothe, of course) and to finally do so she does something drastic. All throughout she's haunted by Hartigan, whether he's just hallucinations caused by guilt or serving his sentence in Hell is left up to the viewer, but it's all done very well.
This review has run a bit long, so I'm going to wrap it up quickly. I consider Sin City: A Dame to Kill For as a good film, but one not without its disappointments. The violence is toned down, the Dame story runs a bit too fast and...well I don't really yet have the exact words, other that what I've already said in this review that I fear may be a bit rambling, to say why I wasn't very impressed with the film. I would guess that it would be that I simply got too hyped for the film and put my expectations too high. That being said, despite my disappointment I would gladly see it again (but not in 3D, it's honestly wasn't worth it) because I still consider A Dame to Kill For a good film and will be buying it on Blu-ray as soon as it comes out. It may sound to some a bit contradictory, but there it is.",1409961600,2,5046,4.213842975206612
6555775,3,B00M482XH4,"Miller, in a recent Empire photo, is just about unrecognizable. Just as his recent comic work is compared to his stunning Ronin or Daredevil.

Dame to kill for was the last VERY good Miller comic, that was captivating and had an emotional punch. And it was certainly visually spectacular on the big screen!
The stories in the last half were bad. Consisting of new material written for the movie, the detour starts off very promising with a  great cast, but hits a dead end ditch all too soon. The final simple story consists of Nancy deciding to kill Rourke with Marv along for the ride.

6555776,4,B00M482XH4,"Nine Things about the Movie Sin City: A Dame to Kill For  [USA, 2014]

1. In 2005, the original ""Sin City"" was released. It was a startling, ultra violent, hyper noir film based on the famous graphic novel. It was a masterpiece of atmosphere and style.

2. Nine years later, the sequel is released. Directed by the same two guys (Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller) this is more of the exact same thing. Same style, same atmosphere, and some of the same characters as the first film - even one character thats dead.

3. As with the original, this movie features several separate stories that intertwine with each other. Characters float in and out of the various stories to kind of tie them all together and make it feel like one big terrible place. You can never be sure who will live and who will die.

4. Beneath the gorgeous visuals, the movie is a cynical, depressing look at a place where nobody is happy, everything is corrupt, and even if love isn't really just an act of betrayal, it's doomed anyway.

5. One of the stories takes place before the first film. One of them takes place after the first film. The other two stories don't really give any clues as to when they take place.

6. You don't technically have to see the first movie before this one, but its a good idea. There are numerous references to the events of the first film, and it won't always be clear whats going on if you haven't seen it.

7. While there is plenty of violence in this movie, it doesnt feel quite as brutal as the first one.

8.  The strength of the movie is also its weakness. Filmed in black and white with splashes of color, it's a mixture of live action, computer animation, and comic-book-style illustration. It's gorgeous, but its the same stuff as in the first one. There are no new innovations in its style or technique, even though the filmmakers had nine years to think about it.

9. This movie moves a little more slowly than the first, and the stories aren't quite as cool. But its still beautiful, violent, and one of the more original movies of this year. Fans of the first movie should still find plenty to love about this one.",1409529600,81,2133,4.443589743589744
6555777,4,B00M482XH4,"This film centers on the relationship of private detective Dwight (Josh Brolin) and that of his former girlfriend Ava (Eva Green) who plays him. Then about 20 minutes from the end, an undeveloped subplot involving Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) and his illegitimate son (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finishes off the picture.

This film has all the neat graphics as the original. The plot is not as confused as the first one which was a weave of subplots and flashbacks. If you haven't seen the first film, I would not recommend watching this one as the end will be very confusing. Clearly this production is not nearly as good as the first one, but they did a nice job bringing back the cast, I just wish they had a better story line.

Eva Green stars as our femme fatale as Scarlett Johansson has filled her quota for nude scenes this year. Jessica Alba becomes a major player only in the last part of the film. Due to the graphic novel style, no one looks like they aged. and Nancy (Alba) still looks like a kitten on stage. The film still incorporates the colorful/metaphorical monologue.

""Liquid darkness fills us both.""
""Death is just like life in Sin City.""
""The Goddess make slaves of us.""

Worth watching if you have seen the first one. Don't expect the complexity.

Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For

 Imagine Dashiel Hammet swirled into an ice cream Sunday with Batman, the Dark Knight, then set on fire and you have some idea of Frank Miller's Sin City: a Dame to Kill For.  The rhythms and the language of the of the classic film Noir hard boiled gangster flicks of the 1930's and 1940's have been matched with the bold style of cartoonist Frank Miller to make an altogether arresting visual and emotional montage to confuse and delight the audience.
 Sin City: A Dame to Kill For earns an entirely proper hard R rating.  The violence comes at us more or less non stop and in a very graphic way.  Unlike some other recent films, rich red blood spatter does not accompany every blow, every gunshot.  The mostly all black and white film shows the blood spatter instead in splashes of white on a black field, which I suppose we can consider an improvement.  The hard R rating also covers lengthy episodes of the beauteous and curvaceous Eva Green in the all together.  The faint of heart will not enjoy this one.
 Like Frank Miller's other film projects, the characters contain not so much an occasional flaw to make them interesting, but seem to be all flaws with the occasional redeeming feature.  Johnny, for instance, a young gambler in one of the several inter-related episodes, is a rake and a careless user who we can admire only for his boldness and courage.  Johnny is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a very strong portrayal.  In fact, all of the many famous and near famous actors in the film bring in their best efforts.
 Powers Booth chews through his lines as the boss of Sin City, a man who controls those around him by force of will, well force of will and bullets.  Jessica Alba returns to her role in the original Sin City as a stripper.  She yearns to wreak vengeance on the boss man for his role in the death of her loved one, Bruce Willis.  Willis appears only as a ghost, having sacrificed his life for Alba in the previous film.  Alba in her turn sacrifices her beauty to bring vengeance to the boss man.
 And so the tales intertwine and unroll for us in the dark seats.  Eva Green astonishes by her allure and her unrelenting evil.  Josh Brolin as the private eye who loves her to his own destruction is at once utterly courageous and hopelessly naive.
 Lady Gaga, Jeremy Piven and Stacy Keach all have small supporting roles.  Mickey Rourke plays a guy who lives to kill and plays it with complete authenticity.  Ray Lotta and Christopher Lloyd appear briefly.  Dennis Haysbert plays a thug in the thrall of the evil Eva Green character.  Rosario Dawson plays a whore who loves someone she shouldn't.  The tales are intense and very hard.  They are about people who all seem to be on the outer edges of their lives.
 Frank Miller wrote the screenplay from his own original graphic novel.  He directed and produced in tandem with Robert Rodriguez.  Rodriguez is known for his lighthearted films loaded with violence.
 This gritty, violent gangster film lasts for one hour and 42 minutes.  Miller also made 300: Rise of an Empire using Eva Green earlier in 2014.  I liked the four saw blade Sin City much better.  I may be in the minority on this.  The movie took in only $10 million world wide over the three day opening weekend.  This may not be enough to make Frank Miller the producer whole.  Estimates of the budget for Sin City: A Dame to Kill For reach from the absurd to the stratospheric.  Miller and Rodriguez may have spent a fortune making a movie so graphic and rough that not enough people will be willing to watch it to make their money back.  It is for all that quite an experience...and Eva Green is really something.",1409356800,5,3736,4.526158445440957
6555779,4,B00M482XH4,"2005s Sin City is one of my favorite movies. I saw it when it came out - I probably shouldnt have, as I was only 12 years old. Even then, I knew what noir was. I adored the style, and the way the characters came across. I knew female empowerment when I saw the ladies of Old Town. I knew and loved the the just-any-guy-with-nothing-to-lose character that Sin City was stuffed with. So, Id been waiting for the sequel that director Robert Rodriguez promised for almost a decade. As the years passed, it seemed less and less likely this sequel would get off the ground. Im glad it finally did, but

""Sin City: A Dame To Kill For"" mostly falls on the same level as the original. The visuals are striking and beautiful, the violence is plentiful and almost joyous, the characters are the same great noir archetypes from the original, but a few things went wrong. Granted, its only a few things.

""A Dame To Kill For"" follows three intertwined stories featuring many of the same sordid characters from the original. Damsel in distress no more, Nancy (Jessica Alba) teams up with Marv (Mickey Rourke) to take down Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), who was responsible for the downfall of Nancys lover Hartigan (Bruce Willis). Meanwhile, Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) also plans to kill Roark, but not after defeating him at his own game. Also, Dwight (Josh Brolin this time, not Clive Owen, not that the two actors look alike) could be taken down by his ex lover Ava Lord (Eva Green,) the classic noir femme fatale.

Green also starred in the hit-or-miss sequel (spinoff?) 300: Rise of an Empire, where she was the real star of the show. Shes devilishly good here too as another big bad. She reminds us, once again, that sometimes the villains are more interesting than the heroes.

But nobodys really a hero in the world of Sin City. Everyone exists in a moral gray area, which makes the characters adventures all the more interesting. But nobody is really here for groundbreaking storytelling. The inimitable style that flooded the first film is still all over the place in this sequel, and its only enhanced by 3D visuals that actually heighten the experience, rather than detract from it.

There are a few problems in this sequel that push it down a notch from the original. Three major parts are recast, most noticeably Clive Owens Dwight. Josh Brolin does a fine job, but he looks nothing like the character from the first film. Clive Owen didn't die or anything - why wasn't he available to reprise his role?

Also, the movie is just too short. The first felt more complete in comparison, even though its only about 25 minutes longer. It felt like A Dame To Kill For started and ended in the same breath. I wish it would have given the characters and actors a little more time to breathe and evolve their characters a little more. I was pleased that Nancy (Alba) was given room to become a dynamic character, but I can only imagine what she could have done with a little more.

Maybe this is going to be a trilogy, and this represents the somewhat lesser middle part of the saga. I wasn't let down, necessarily by A Dame To Kill For. I didn't get bored and check my watch once the whole time. Fans of Rodriguez and the original should love it. Others need not apply.

I'm really sad to have to give this 3 stars!!",1409184000,,1174,4.199115044247788

6555782,5,B00M482XH4,"Where do you find Mickey Rourke with a jaw bigger than Hell Boy's... Or Stacy Keach sporting a neck thicker and more marbled than Jabba the Hutt's...

...Where the tough guys' narrations sound bitter, weary, sardonic, and rough enough to make Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer say,""Fugedaboutit"" and go back to the office to drink....

...Where the only colors you see are in a woman's hair or eyes or lips (and the odd dress, coat, and squad car light)...

...Where every dancer is Jessica Alba and all her dances are kinky with whips, ropes, guns and her pelvis moves in ways that makes eunuchs...

...Where a father breaks his son's fingers over a card game and kneecaps the kid just to make clear who is alpha...

...Where the two women, even the good one, play their men for saps...

.... Where Josh Brolin looks like he just stepped off the set of Old Boy to take up the role of tough guy PI ready to be tricked by the same dame who broke his heart and tore out his soul...and who will do it again...

Where? You know. You saw Sin City and liked it enough to read a review of its sequel.

Just remember nobody just wakes up in Sin City: they come out of comas, they stir from whiskey sweats, they shake their heads to clear concussions after being beaten senseless...

Fun viewing. This movie gives interconnected stories of corruption and deceit a good name.",1409011200,,1373,4.481927710843373
6555783,3,B00M482XH4,"After the 2005 release of Sin City, Robert Rodriquez announced that there would be more from the fictional city immortalized by the graphic novels of Frank Miller.  After completing the screenplay in 2007, the film though went into hiatus until 2012 when filming began. A Dame to Kill For has had a long journey to the big screen and its up to us to determine if it was worth the wait.

A Dame to Kill For is a blending of four-short stories, Just Another Saturday Night, A Dame to Kill For, The Long Bad Night and Nancys Last Dance. All of these stories have one thing in common; revenge. Revenge is a bitter pill and mixed with the dirty, dark reputation of Sin City, there isn't much of an upside to the emotions explored in the movie. Everybody talks with gravelly voices and everybody broods relentlessly; everybody.

This is what you come to expect when you venture into Sin City though. You shouldnt expect anything else. The name says it all. For that matter, A Dame to Kill For is a beautiful mix of graphic justice and deep, dark intentions from near everybody involved. On top of that, the cartoonish backdrop blend with real actors and environments comes across brilliantly in 3D and for that alone is worth a trip to the theater. Within minutes of the film beginning you are immersed in the visuals of Sin City and the stories it has to tell. As well, you will feel the heavy weight that Sin City bares.

This though, may be part of the movies problem because as good of a job as the movie does to bring you there and drag you into its filth, once you're done with the journey, you may be anxious to leave. You don't venture to Sin City to find joy and happiness, but you also don't go to the movies to feel weighted down by relentless drama, darkness and human filth. A Dame to Kill For is exactly what you expect and don't expect anything else.",1408924800,3,1859,4.411078717201166
6555784,5,B00M482XH4,"Wow - ten years already?

Frank Miller does it yet again. First, in the comic - he didn't invent noir, not even in the world of comics, not by a long shot. He reinvented it, though, put his own hard-edged stamp on it, added just enough comic-y visual exaggeration, then cast it in starkest black and white, with spots of color like bullet holes across the page. Then he did it again in the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B0065AVS0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>&nbsp;movie. At  the time, it was breakthrough technique, a look that had never been done before, not in the hundred-ish years of feature films before it.

Then again, in this movie. The look is there, and the characters, and the hard edges. A few separate plots intertwine, as different characters go about their dark business. Even if the thrill of absolute novelty is off it, all the things that made the first film memorable are here, too. Raw violence, graphics that keep you guessing, eroticism toned down enough and characters amped up enough for comic books, and the feeling that darkness will never end - that day has just given up on Old Town.

There have been dozens if not hundreds of live-action movie adaptations of comics. Few, maybe none, have preserved the comic-book feel as well as the original Sin City movie, and now this. Ignore little things like strippers who don't strip, cops that ignore body counts in the dozens, and the shifting, shifty notion of what passes for ""justice."" Just enjoy what it is, bare-knuckle story-telling at its visual peak.

Pretty much the whole film was shot green screen with digital environments, so filmmakers could do whatever they wanted with the 3D. And boy did they deliver. Whole film looks like a moving, 3D popup graphic novel. Snow floats all around, cityscapes stretch on forever, blood gushes (black and white), car chases, knives and arrows fly, dizzying high angle shots ... LOVED this one in 3D.
