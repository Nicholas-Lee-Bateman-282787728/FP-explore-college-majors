4599790,5,B0058M0852,"It's bawdy, ridiculous comedy - and I would not have it any other way. Brilliant stuff for every guy's inner meat head - gorgeous girls, grubby sex jokes and ridiculous football pranks that make me say to my mates: ""Hey, remember when we did something like that...?""
Your wife/girlfriend may not like it, but for every episode of True Blood you have to sit and watch with her, have her share an episode of this classic series with you.",1389571200,,435,4.518987341772152

4599794,5,B0058M0852,"Must have if you're a fan and want to see the show again.
You get all the episodes from season two plus some bonus features!",1372204800,,124,4.0
4599795,5,B0058M0852,"I first watched this show for two episodes and stopped recording it. I was at my son's place and he started showing if from Netflix. This time I found if hilarious. The addition of Denise Richards did not do much for me, especially as the angry slut ex-wife.",1370044800,,258,4.395833333333333
4599796,5,B0058M0852,"A great way to relive a truly underrated show.  ...Not exactly for the whole family, but some hilariously sophomoric humor",1364774400,,122,5.1
4599797,5,B0058M0852,If ur in college or not and you don't mind crazy college weirdness and Comedy of a 20 yr old then you will love this show and it does show some nudity,1364515200,,150,3.71875
4599798,5,B0058M0852,This is a must watch for all adult fans of college football shows. Leave the kids in another room please!,1362960000,,105,4.3
4599799,5,B0058M0852,so i got both seasons of bms and they are so funny and love to watch it over and over again.  if your a big fan of this show you have to get these seasons on dvd,1360713600,,161,3.3513513513513513
4599800,5,B0058M0852,I hate that they cancelled this. This was the best show in years. I enjoyed every second of all three seasons. The cocaine episodes are the funniest. I like how the chicks are hot and the guys like to party!,1359590400,,207,4.2
4599801,5,B0058M0852,Everything about this show is amazing from the ridiculously hilarious storylines to the parties and hot women portrayed in every episode.,1356220800,,137,5.571428571428571
4599802,5,B0058M0852,"i wish there were just a few more add ons, deleted scenes, commentary, a little book or something! (maybe some stuff too raunchy for TV) just anything would be nice... it feels like this is bare bones, but if you are only interested in the show and the episodes then is is 5/5 star",1355443200,,281,4.222222222222222
4599803,5,B0058M0852,Funny... what more could be said? College football team with Super Trooper comedy. Ahhhh... the years i missed out on by joining the military.,1354665600,,142,4.958333333333333
4599804,5,B0058M0852,"This is the the best TV show on Television. I work mornings and Make sure I stay up to watch it, my biggest complaint is that there only 13 episodes per season. Season 3 needs to be Released ASAP. this series IS A MUST BUY! Denise Richards joins the cast that should be nuff said right there. Necessary Roughness with Scot Bakula would have been proud! This series Rocks! its one big party, I had to watch all the episodes at least 3 times to catch the whole episode, I was laughing so hard.  Yes the series is wrong but it is totally AWESOME! I have bought 3 copies just to get the next season out.! I will buy 3 more copies just because I love this series that much!!! enjoy!",1342483200,,677,4.1679389312977095
4599805,5,B0058M0852,"I enjoyed Season 1 (see my review for Season 1) but BMS is a better show in Season 2.

With Sam Jones III/Craig Shilo out of the mix for Season 2, we are introduced to a new character in Page Kennedy/Radon Randell.  While I enjoy Sam Jones III's ironically naive presence on screen, I found the super-star QB caricature of Radon much more dynamic against Thad, Alex, and Coach Daniels.  Denise Richards joins the cast as Coach Marty Daniels' ex-wife and hits all the right notes for her role (I never knew she could be this funny).  Sammy's sister Mary Jo(Frankie Shaw) provides a female counterpart to Alex while taking part in many of the show's most disgusting jokes, and we spend more time with the hilariously deadpan James Cade/Harmon Tedesco.

What makes this season so much better?  There were a few episodes last season that went over the edge and never came back (""Rivalry Weekend"" for one) but this time there is at least one heart-warming (in classic BMS style) moment per episode.  It still feels like the writers are messing with you, like that rowdy friend with the ""Yo Momma"" jokes, but this season everyone eventually finds a way to ""hug it out"".

Roll in a keg (or pop open a Growler), relax your brain muscle, and ""bring it in"" for 13 more episodes of this fun show.  If you don't like it, why are your reading this? Have you seen Season 1?  Get with it and catch up already!",1338163200,6,1394,4.496031746031746
4599806,5,B0058M0852,"This product came as purchased.  It was fast, easy and without any glitches at all.  This was a birthday present for my daughter and she loved it.  I would warn that it is not a good series for young children or even adults who do not like a lot of sex and drugs.  However, we do at our house.  Enjoy!",1334016000,3,301,3.95
4599807,5,B0058M0852,This show is awesome!  I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it arrived way before Christmas.  Very Pleased with the service as well as the show.,1325894400,3,149,4.285714285714286
