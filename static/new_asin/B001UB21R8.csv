8343255,5,B001UB21R8,"""The World That Perished"" is a compelling defense of the Biblical and scientific evidence for the Genesis flood as a global catastrophe. The book is a great read - very interesting. The companion DVD version of the book is a fascinating, fast moving documentary which graphically presents the evidence for the Genesis Flood as a global catastrophe. I would highly recommend both the book and the DVD.",1362528000,3,400,4.985074626865671
