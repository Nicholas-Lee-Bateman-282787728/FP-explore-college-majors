7948858,4,B00005OCMX,"A&E Home video presents us with a unique story about child stars. Narrated by Halley Mills three dozen child stars spanning five generations of Hollywood reveal their inner most thoughts about being the focus of attention in the movies and on television. This round table discussion is headed by some of the great child stars that you never will forget. Patty Ducke, Mellissa Gilbert, Todd Bridges, Malcom Jamal-Warner are just a few of the varied former child stars who talk about their experiences.
  Was it all glamour and fun on the set? You will be surprised to hear their answers which range from the good, the bad and the downright ugly. Child stars unlike other children live a life beyond reality that in many cases make them out of step with their peers. We hear these adults tell us the challenges that they had in their families, the difficulties in being normal adolescents, the pressure of being on the set and after turning eighteen finding out that your parents have squandered your money, leaving you penniless.
  These revelations are astounding and you see that living the life of a child star is much more stressful than one would think. I enjoyed hearing them share some of the things that they had to undergo and their unique problems of being an actor. What was most interesting is listening to how they dealt with being a ""has been"" after becoming adults and no longer are in the camera's view. How they dealt with such a rejection is a lesson in maintaining one's spirit.
  The group was entertaining, a bit morbid at times but none of them regretted their experiences. Many grew from the pitfalls and were able to establish their own unique careers. It is good to see how hopeful they are. These are true troopers that are worth seeing and hearing their side of the story.",1024358400,,1798,4.692063492063492
