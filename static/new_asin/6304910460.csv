The four-year span between that one and ""Curse of the Puppet Master"" here speaks for it, and I'm sorry to write that a good deal of the strengths of the previous films have been lost during that time. This fifth sequel is far from dreadful but nonetheless a far cry from what I had come to expect of the series. It's a decent genre picture, but not much of a ""Puppet Master"" movie.

The story: a meek young man with a gift for whittling (Josh Green,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spiders/dp/B000055WFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spiders</a>) is hired by the current Puppet Master (George Peck,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Mummy/dp/B0000V48LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Mummy</a>) to craft a unique new creation...

The most obvious qualm any fan can have with the film is that the puppets are not used nearly to their fullest effect. They seem to have undergone a slight physical makeover, but more disappointing is that most of what you seem of them is stock footage lifted from earlier pictures. The new scenes feature seriously weak puppetry (does pushing a stiff figure across the screen even count as puppetry?) and a noticeable absence of stop-motion animation. Director David DeCoteau had previously directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-of-the-best-entries/dp/B003YCL0TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one of the best entries</a>&nbsp;into the series, so I was marginally relieved that the technical deficiencies are apparently due to budgetary restrictions (this was the first film of the bunch to not be co-produced by Paramount), not a sudden drop in directorial talent.

DeCoteau actually does a reasonably good job with what he has, puppets aside. He sees the series turn off the action-adventure route it had taken and steers it back to the horror medium. The slasher scenes are fairly brutal and bloody, and here we find also the first serious attempts since the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-Master/dp/B003L2YUEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet Master</a>&nbsp;at psychological scares. The eventual twist is pretty satisfying, provided that the movie's advertising doesn't spoil it for you ahead of time. Veteran horror writer Benjamin Carr's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thirteen-Ghosts/dp/B00005UQ9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thirteen Ghosts</a>) screenplay is fairly intriguing, focusing mainly on character relationships and doing this well enough that I hardly mind the contrived romance angle between Josh Green and Emily Harrison (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Take/dp/B001G5RSRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Take</a>).

The dramatic content is good for the most part, despite the inclusion of some hambone roles for Michael Guerin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kraa-the-Sea-Monster/dp/B0000V46UE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kraa! the Sea Monster</a>) as the jerk bully and Robert Donavan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rod-Steele-0014/dp/B000060MW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rod Steele 0014</a>) as the jerk sheriff. Their parts are salvaged by the performers going appropriately over-the-top, and Emily Harrison does well, but as is tradition, the man playing the Puppet Master is most memorable among the cast - enough so that I wonder why George Peck hasn't seen more starring roles. The performer who doesn't do too well is Josh Green, who puts in the effort but never convinces me of how meek and simple his character is supposed to be.

""Curse of the Puppet Master"" seems to be regarded as the flick that initiated a downturn in the series, and sure enough, it's my least favorite of the bunch so far. It's a decent watch on a slow night, but don't use this to get your first impression of the series. Fans can take it or leave it.",1413417600,4,4291,6.724324324324324

937783,4,6304910460,"CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER

""Puppet Master"" is one of my all time favorite film series ever without a doubt. In fact it could be my favorite, right up there with ""Hellraiser"" and ""The Evil Dead"". I remember not even knowing about this film when it first came out and was completely surprised when I happened upon it at the video store. I grabbed it and checked it out that night. Of course I went to the mall that weekend and bought it since I had to have it. Eventually like all of them I grabbed the DVD as well since I had the VHS at first only.

The story follows a young man that goes by Tank who has a great talent for wood carving. He is approached one day by a man named Dr. Magrew and his daughter Jane. They step in on his behalf when he is being picked on by some local bullies and then notice a piece of wood he was working on. Magrew quickly offers him a job at his museum to carve for him. Things go well and he strikes up a romance with Jane who introduces him to the Puppets that her father now has. Of course things are not as they seem and there may be more to Dr. Magrew than anyone including his daughter think.

Now this came out years after the 5th film which was supposed to be the final film in the series. Even still it is the final Puppet Master film to have that old school Full Moon feel to it. Now that does not mean it is as good as the others. In fact it falls short of those original ones but it may still be the best of the sequels since then. Now it is obvious that the puppets are not used like they were before with the stop motion stuff. With that said that did not stop me from liking this flick, there was just something else I can't put my finger on that brings it down in the ratings for me.

It could be the ending that just seems kinda, eh, but I get what they were going for. Writer Benjamin Carr came up with an interesting storyline for this installment but it wasn't executed to its full potential. Maybe that's on director David DeCoteau who has done some great films [including the best film in the franchise if you ask most ""Puppet Master 3""] but like I said it is not a horrible flick. That saving grace may be the acting here. George Peck is excellent as Dr. Magrew and may be the MVP of the production; he does not get enough work in my opinion. Emily Harrison who plays his daughter is great here as well and plays the girl next door type perfectly. Josh Green plays young Tank and plays him kinda weird and quirky but still friendly. Those performances plus the supporting players did a great job.

This was a fun addition to the series that does not live up to its predecessors but is better than the things that followed. Well at least as far as I remember I might have to re-watch all of them again. But I do recommend this flick to any fan of the puppets or Full Moon. Good for a rainy day or something, I just wish this would have had a commentary on it.",1383004800,2,2914,4.0874125874125875

So 1st off let's start with special effects; I get sick of hearing this with scary movies, some of the best scary movies have these kind, and hello! These are the ones I grew up on! 2nd I like this plotline, and about Leech woman coming back from the 2nd film and brought here? So what? It's a movie; you can bring characters back it's not a crime!

937786,1,6304910460,"Anyone who has a soft spot for B-Movies knows of B-movie legend Charles Band's production company Full Moon. Anyone that knows Full Moon knows that the company's bread and better was the Puppet Master franchise. The first film was released in 1989 and was a huge success fro the new company. A sting of solid sequels followed throughout the early 90's all the way through Puppet Master 5, which was advertised and proclaimed to be ""the final chapter"". A spin-off trilogy entitled ""Puppet Wars"" was then announced to start in 1995. However some drama went down at the house of Full Moon that would change the company forever. The major change is that the partnership between Full Moon and Paramount (their distributor) ended. Information differs for why their partnership dissolved but this event marks the decline of Full Moon and the dark years of the company began.

Out of these dark years of Full Moon came the resurrection of the Puppet Master franchise with the release of the sixth film ""Curse of the Puppet Master"", a sequel no doubt made to make a quick buck for the failing company and the final product shows it. Following is a list of problems with the film:

#1 - THE PLOT. The plot is a complete rip-off of the 1973 horror film SSSSSSS. In that film a father turns his aid/daughters boyfriend into a snake. In this one a puppet. Not much difference.

#2  - STOCK FOOTAGE. Many of the puppet scenes are recycled footage from previous entries. Even scenes from the horrid wavy DVD transfer from Puppet Master II are present! Stock footage spliced in to represent ""new footage"" just reeks of cheapness and laziness.

#3 - CONTINUITY. Some continuity errors from previous entries is acceptable, but bringing back characters that were clearly destroyed in other entries and bringing them back without even the lamest explanation isn't acceptable and an insult to the fans.

#4 - THE EFFECTS. This marks the first entry not to feature those nifty stop motion effects of the late great Dave Allen. Instead we get stiff and poor rod puppetry.

#5 - THE TITLE. This one may be minor but I hate when series start going all wonky with the sequel titles (Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street...I'M LOOKING AT YOU!). The titles of the first films were straight forward with numbers...so why change it now?

Overall I felt that this was a cheap-jack entry made with no intention other than $$. They took a plot from an old movie, slapped in stock footage and called it good. Hard to believe this drivel came from the same director of the enjoyable ""Puppet Master III."" Surprisingly this isn't the worst entry in the series as Retro Puppet Master, Puppet Master: The Legacy, and Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys would be soon to come. A tenth entry entitled ""Puppet Master: Axis of Evil"" is being filmed at the moment but I wouldn't hold my breath. My advice so far is stick to entries 1 - 5. I only own this film because it came in the Puppet Master box set.",1263081600,2,2963,4.652007648183557
937787,1,6304910460,"Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) After part five was promised to be 'The Final Chapter,' Full Moon Entertainment promptly started promoting the return of their popular characters in the ""Puppet Wars"" series, which looked to be fairly ambitious in scope, at least if you believed the drawn-long-before-the-movie-was-made poster art. But once again, Full Moon's ideas were bigger than their bank account, so instead we get this extremely cheap and tedious hour and fourteen minutes.
  The 'story' has the puppets suddenly and mysteriously under the thumb of a maniacal scientist trying to use their secrets to construct a life size puppet/human hybrid. Why? I have no idea. In and around this, the scientist's daughter and slow witted handyman frolic. Of course, the young dimwit is targeted by the scientist as the perfect specimen for his experiments, thereby seriously jeopardizing the romance. Finally, waaaaayy into this stodgy soap opera, the scientist sends the puppets out to kill a couple of guys. Yawn. This is far and away the worst of the Puppet Master movies.  This one truly looks like it was shot over a weekend on a budget of about $10,000. It was directed by David DeCoteau, who also made the best of the series, part three. But apparently recognizing the handicaps he was working with here, DeCoteau wisely chose to throw one of his female pseudonyms on for the credits.
  My last round of long winded squawking about this movie is in regards to where it fits in the continuity of the series. (I don't know why I care about this, but I do.) It doesn't work as a continuation of part five, since that set up the idea of more adventures with their new puppet master. About the only place it fits is between parts two and four (since three was a WWII era flashback). That still leaves two untold stories--#1: what happened at the mental hospital they were heading to at the end of part two; and how that led them into the clutches of the evil doctor here. Then you somehow have to #2: get the puppets from this movie's nonsensical non-ending back to the Bodega Bay Inn for parts four and five. It's too bad; when these movies work they are fun little flicks. But this one is the bottom of the barrel.",1233187200,3,2214,4.710594315245478
937799,4,6304910460,"""Curse of the Puppet Master"" is an enjoyable, albeit not original, entry in the infamous Puppet Master series.  It has a script that blatantly mimics the classic creature feature ""Sssssss"" scene by scene.  Instead of a mad scientist turning humans into cobras, Dr. Magrew (George Peck) is turning them into living puppets.  He recruits an adorably dopey young man, Robert, (Josh Green) to become his new lab assistant.  His incredibly cute daughter Jane (Emily Harrison) is smitten by him.  Meanwhile, they are harassed by Joey (Michael D. Guerin) the town muscle head who likes to wear tank tops and lift weights.  Instead of employing snakes to commit murders, Dr. Magrew uses Andre Toulon's living puppets, especially Blade and Tunneler.

  Though not as well crafted as ""Sssssss,"" ""Curse of the Puppet Master"" is highly recommended because of its character development.  You can't help but adore poor Robert and Emily - a type of Romeo and Juliet.  You feel much sympathy for them, knowing that their love is doomed by Dr. Magrew's evil plans.  The cast is a gorgeous one, lending the film a touch of eroticism.  The acting from the leads is rather good considering that none of them are big name stars.  Many fans complained about the film's open ending - a lack of resolution.  The open, downbeat ending was a very popular device used in the 1970's.  It was often used to chill and terrify the audience.  The ending for ""Curse of the Puppet Master"" is very much like the one for ""Sssssss.""

  ""The Curse of the Puppet Master"" deserves a place in the mad scientist genre.  I liken Dr. Magrew to Dr. Victor Frankenstein who strove to create new life.  Furthermore, if you haven't seen ""Sssssss,"" I recommend that you do.  Watch ""Sssssss"" and ""The Curse of the Puppet Master"" back to back and you will be surprised at the similarities.  The two films were released over twenty-five years apart.  The cast in ""Sssssss"" was high caliber.  Strother Martin was the mad scientist, Heather Menzies played his daughter, Dirk Benedict was the lab assistant, and Reb Brown was the bullying jock.  Does Hal Dresner know that Benjamin Carr stole his screenplay?  Only joking.  After all, imitation is the best form of flattery.",1231632000,,2219,4.858288770053476
937800,2,6304910460,"After sitting through the two previous train wrecks that were Puppet Master 4 and 5, I felt that this series had really no where to go but up. Thankfully, with Curse of the Puppet Master, the storyline goes totally away from the previous 2 movies. Though apparently the plot of this film rips off the old Sci-Fi Horror movie called Sssssss. Its a about a young man named Robert a.k.a ""Tank"" who is hired by the ""new"" puppet master named Dr. Magrew to help create the perfect puppet. Dr. Magrew has been unsuccessful in re-creating Andre Toulon's ability to bring puppets to life so far , but the Dr. has a dark secret, in that he's wanting to put Robert's soul into the puppet that Robert himself is creating so that the puppet will live. Again, the plot isn't great, but its gotta be better than the storyline to Part 4 and 5. However, just like the other Puppet Master films, there are some horrible screw ups that takes place here. First off, the puppet Leech Woman returns in this one, though she was clearly destroyed in Puppet Master 2. Not even that, but Leech Woman doesn't even have a kill in the film!! In fact, most of the puppets don't do much at all. The death count isn't that high as well. The end of the film makes no sense either. Throughout the movie, Robert is working on a puppet thats made out of wood. Yet, at the adbrupt ending of the film, the puppet that Robert had been working on appears to be some futuristic mechanical gadget made of metal, not wood. The ""special"" effects, if one has the nerve to call them that, have to been the worst of the series, and the editing and directing is horrible. Actually, in some cases, old footage is used from previous Puppet Master films and injected into this one. And don't worry, the acting is just as bad as everything else. Take special note of the way over-acting tough guy Sheriff!! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry! In a nutshell, this is horribly cheap-made film with crappy effects, bad directing, and terrible acting. To say its better than the some previous Puppet Master films in the series may be just splitting hairs, cause at this point, who really cares? But since this story, though it may have been ripped off, is slightly better than previous storylines about little demons from the underworld coming back to earth to do..well..whatever, I gotta give this film a slightly better rating than those previous sequels. As a stand alone film, its a tough watch. I wouldn't recommend sitting through it more than once, and wouldn't buy it at all, unless you need it for your Puppet Master collection.",1195344000,2,2584,4.547210300429184
937801,2,6304910460,"I was really enjoying this Puppet Master, until the very end. What kind of an excuse for an ending was that? As it sucks you in, and has you wondering whats going to happen, it's just all of a sudden over, and the credits begin to roll.

It's like they ran out of funding for the movie, and didn't have any money left to shoot any more to finish it. I cant understand why the heck anyone would just  make an ending like that, one that's over in the blink of an eye.

The rest of the film was kinda cheesy. The puppets looked pretty stupid, with their only animation being their hands moving up and down like... well, I don't know, like bad puppetearing I guess, kind of like bad imitations of ""Thunderbird's"". It almost seems like they where toys with limited animation that should have been playing door bell kind of music as they move around.

I liked the plot and the movie up until the last 5 minutes. It just ceased to go on when it was starting to pick up and needed a final scene. And I don't get how making a wooden puppet ends up becoming an electronic tank.. i dunno, see the movie to understand what I mean, but if you never see this movie, you haven't missed out on anything special.

937802,1,6304910460,"If you take the Puppet Master series for what it is then it was a fairly strong direct-to-video B-franchise with its first 5 entries. Puppet Master 6 (released under the title Curse of the Puppet Master) however is the major drop of the series and was made when Full Moon Pictures was having some finacial trouble. During this hard time at Full Moon they pumped out really cheap and really lame sequels in their successfull franchises (Subspecies IV and Trancers 6). Curse comes out better than some of their other sequels but it is still a band film

The story is a direct steal from the 1970's horror film Ssssssssss. When have a young simpleton boy taken in by a freindly magician (with a dark secret) and his daughter. The boy and the daughter fall in love but her father has other plans for the boy....to turn him into a living puppet! Oh, the magician also has our lovable killer dolls as pets in cages.

Fans of the series will notice many plot holes, the most noticable one being the return of Ms. Leech who was clearly burned to death in Puppet Master II.

What makes this sequel sink lower is that Full Moon pulls a ""Roger Corman"" with some of the films footage. What I mean by this is that Full Moon pulls footage from previous Puppet Master films and splices it into this film play as NEW material. This is not flashback type storytelling containing clips from previous films. Roger Corman was notorious for this as he lifted scenese from previous films and spliced it into his new films. An example is the Deathstalker series where each sequel contains footage from the first Deathstalker played off as ""new"" footage. This is extremely cheap and hackeyed filmmaking that is an insult to fans.

Curse of the Puppet Master may not be the worst of the overlong series (Retro Puppet Master and Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys take that ""prize"") but it is close. I personally only own the film because it came in the box set with the rest of the series.",1162598400,3,1960,4.543909348441926
937803,5,6304910460,"I'll skip the synopsis since adequate ones are already given.  Since this is the most readily available full-length Puppet Master movie, most of you are likely to view this one first.  I have to say that this sequel was far better than Parts 4 & 5.  If you already are a fan of this series, then you'll likely enjoy this movie since it captures much of the same charm that were in the first 3.  The storyline itself is interesting enough for a b-movie, and you really get a sense of who these characters (and the puppets) are.  It has all the makings you'll ever need of horror cheese:  The lonely old man and his beautiful daughter, a love interest between that daughter and the new 'boy' hired by the father, a town bully who gets his, and a near comical jerk local sheriff.

The main problems I had with the previous two was that the storyline focused mainly on the human characters and lost sight of the puppets.  This movie focuses a little more on the people too, but I found this story interesting enough.  The dolls do serve an interesting role in this sequel and don't seem to be cut out as much as they were in Part 4.  The special effects are of course, on par with the previous two, and does detract from the movie a bit.  But I feel that most b-movie, killer doll loving people will enjoy this sequel even if you haven't seen any of the previous ones.

SPOILERS - Only for those that have seen the movie, otherwise scroll to last paragraph

It was nice to see nearly all the puppets back for this one.  Since this series has enjoyed going back into the past, it might be interesting to find out exactly what happened between 5 and this one.  How did this Magrew find the secret out?  Did he need that serum, or were the puppets now officially 'alive'?

I thought that former assistant of Magrew's turned puppet resembled Adrien Brody.  Possible early role for him??

I didn't like how the dvd cover to this movie spoils the story.  Although I probably would have figured it out anyway, I didn't need to know that the 'doctor' was really a bad guy.  This might not have bothered me if they didn't also mention that the dolls were going to turn on him.  I sat throughout the whole movie waiting for this to happen and it kinda took a little fun out of it for me.

My final verdict:  I would highly recommend, as the featured reviewer states, buying the box set.  I made the mistake of buying a set off of ebay for close to $200 - still far cheaper than here.  But (as of present time) [...] is selling brand new factory sealed sets for about half of that price.  Since the rest of the series isn't readily available anywhere else, this is a pretty good deal.  As for the single movie, i'd suggest renting it first if you have serious doubts about the series.  If you like these kinds of movies, go for the box set.

937847,5,6304910460,"This film was the best ever. It has great special effects,cast,setting,and stroy. This is a film about Andre Toulon's deadly-killer puppets and they want to play with YOU!FullMoonPictures did a excellent job on this film. The story is scary and s is the movie. Yes,all of the old puppets are back not new ones. Blade,Jester,Pinhead,Tunnler,Leech Woman,Torch,and the Totem. Thsi film was better than Vampire Journals(another Fullmoonpictures film released when this film came out)and I think the best Puppet Master film out of the whole series but no film can beat the first Puppet Master with the puppets first entry into the world.

937848,4,6304910460,"Ok, first off, these movies are not movies made to hopefully earn an Oscar award. These movies are just great fun. They are mostly just fun. I don't view these movies as horror. There is a great deal of humour in them. Just  imagine several Puppets running around with their own personality and  killing method. Either killing for good causes, but not always. Not easy to  really explain these movies in a few lines. But if you are looking at this  review, I am pretty sure you allready know what the movies are about.
With this boxed set you really do get your moneys worth. Before I bought  it I was sceptical, so many bad reviews on sound and picture. But both  image and audio is OK. Really, how much do you expect from a series that  has been made for direct release on VHS? The quality is not something to  brag about, but it is OK. At least I did not expect more from it.
You get  all seven movies, and each one of them has a great making-of featurette, as  well as trailer and some cast-info. In addition to the seven movies you get  an 8th DVD. This disc contains 45 trailers. All Full Moon Pictures  trailers. Only a few of them are out on DVD, but it is still fun to look at  all the silly, but cool, movies they make.
So all in all, you do get your  moneys worth, and it really is a great oppertunety to own all the movies  with some added extras. If you are a fan, then you need this box. If you  are new to the series, then you should look into what the movies are like.  Maybe rent one on VHS, I am pretty sure you will be hooked. Soon after you  will be starting to collect Puppet Master action figures and you will be  broke! :-)",963964800,32,1646,4.119496855345912
937849,4,6304910460,"Though I belive that curse of the puppet master, the 6th video in the set was not that well made, the entire series as a whole has been one of my favoite since I first watched them.  This boxed set of 8 DVD's contains the  many adventures of a team of puppets that have been brought to life by the  Original Puppet Master Andre Tulon. Each movie continues on with the  puppets adventures as they gain new Masters.  Some of the Puppet Masters  are good, and others are evil, but regardless of their master's intentions  the puppets cary out their wishes using the special deadly talents that  each one was designed with.  Unfortunatly for the last several years many  of the films in this series have been out of print, but now they have all  be released in this great dvd set that I think every horror film lover  should buy.",960681600,9,825,4.3907284768211925

937851,3,6304910460,"I agree with the review from FANGORIA magazine...Curse of the Puppet Master is nothing but a remake of the man-turned-into-a-snake B-movie classic Ssssss, starring Strother (Cool Hand Luke) Martin and Dirk  (Battlestar Galactica) Benedict.  The special effects director is even seen  goofing off with the original snakeman from that camp classic in the Video  Zone segment, so they are proud of their lack of  imagination!
""Story"" theft aside, I found this entry a silly  enough guilty pleasure.  Anyone else notice that the skies are pretty clear  and blue during the day, but there sure is a heck of a lot of lightning,  but no rain, at night.  Sadly the effects are really, really bad.  The  puppets are just dangled on a stick or something, or held by someone under  the camera frame and kind of wobbled back and forth to look like they are  walking or running or whatever.  Blargh!
But I still found myself  enjoying it all.  That just proves that I am insane.",959904000,9,965,4.751515151515152

Personally, I feel they should have stopped after the 3rd one.  #3 what phenomenal.  It had many elements that made it a good horror flick.  The first was ok, the 2nd passable, but the 3rd was great.  the 4th and 5th ridiculous and then the 6th...again, Yawn END",954892800,3,397,4.666666666666667
937853,4,6304910460,"I liked it.  I am a true fan of the series.  The puppets did look like they were floating but they still looked cool.  New inventive death scenes,  Blade looked more like he was giving peoples faces a shave than cutting  them.  Tank looked Okay,  but his face was stupid.  He was also to high  tech,  Why couldn't they have made him like the old puppets,  Instead of an  army tank.  I hope he is not in anymore of the movies.  The puppets did not  kill enogh people like in other movies.  I have seen better,  It is not the  best but it wasn't that bad either.",931564800,2,560,4.074766355140187

7879007,5,6304910460,"Where to begin? Weve made it past the Parmount era and onto the Wizard/Full Moon library of Puppet Master Films. Curse of the Puppet Master, originally written as a full length commercial for the new comic/toy line, David DeCoteau took the reins and created something special.

Video  David states in his audio commentary that certain reels of film had been lost, so the movie itself is presented in a sort of HD/SD hybrid cut with a total of 24 minutes of the film being SD inserts, the new footage is from a new 2K scan. (See below for time stamps) The actual HD film itself has some flaws, people seem to have an orange tint to them during the daylight scenes, but everything happening at night looks fantastic, slight layers of grain are consistent and does not distract from the viewing experience. Most of the puppet action is HD.

Audio  The Audio itself is standard Full Moon fair, very clear and I experienced no issues at all with pops or hissing. Theres also an audio commentary from the director David D which is pretty much an explanation of why the film is presented in an HD/SD cut, he himself mentions it as a Tech Nerd commentary. He does mention some great little facts about how the film came about, like watching a little 70s movie he won't name (SsssSss) for inspiration, and how the movie came about.

Special Features  Other than the commentary, were in for a treat with the original video zone (SD 19:55 minutes) and a fun little commercial promoting the Amazon Full Moon video page.

Overall, if you can get past the SD shots in the film, you're in for a fun ride, because this is honestly the best this film is ever going to look. I will say this, the one major letdown that I had was one of the death scenes was in SD, and its honestly the best scene in the entire flick. With a low death count, but a lot of heart, I personally think that Full Moon and David D (Under the director name of Victoria Sloan) did a terrific job keeping the series alive! If you haven't already, make sure that you check out the previous 5 films, as well as Retro and the newer flicks from Full Moon as well.",1500422400,,2329,4.471563981042654
7879008,3,6304910460,"I'm surprised no one has ever mentioned the fact that this is just the 1973 movie Sssssss with puppets. No joke, it follows the exact same plot points, in order. The only difference is that the scientist turns people into puppets in this, instead of snakes. Everything else is basically the same, give or take a few minor alterations to how some characters died, mainly due to swapping snakes for puppets. If you've seen Sssssss, you know everything that happens in this, and vice-versa.

What I WILL give this one credit for, though, is that the pacing is a lot better than the film it shamelessly copied. Sssssss suffered from too much filler that dragged it out painfully slowly, while this was a good 20 minutes shorter, with a little more happening. And, honestly, the added gore and puppet attacks were more interesting than just watching someone get bitten by a snake, then tumbling over. I suppose that gives it the distinction of being the knock-off that is actually more entertaining than what it was knocking off.",1498521600,3,1024,4.785310734463277
7879009,3,6304910460,Curse of the Puppet Master sees the puppets with another new owner. This movie had lots of promise and even has a few good scenes. In the end though is falls short of anything too exciting or memorable. The acting was alright. The main gripe is with the final act of the film and the horrible final puppet design and animation.,1470528000,,327,4.377049180327869
