8062383,5,B0009JTRGA,Best exercise tape ever made.  I have been Texersizing for 30 years.  I was so upset when my tape broke.  Thankfully I found one on Amazon.  Very happy!!,1413244800,,153,4.357142857142857
8062384,4,B0009JTRGA,"Back in the '80s, pretty much anyone who even qualified halfway as a celebrity could put out a fitness tape. This is not to say that Ms. Mandrell doesn't or didn't then qualify as a 'real' celebrity; I'm just making the point that pretty much everybody and his cousin seemed to be releasing one at some point or another.

If you were female, relatively attractive and young, then you inevitably released an aerobics tape. These were almost all pale imitations of Jane Fonda's classic 1982 'Workout' tape, which to this day remains a gold standard in the genre. Ms. Mandrell's work here, however, ranks somewhere between silver and copper. Electrum..?

She's got the energy, for sure, and a cute little bod to boot, plus the requisite back-up group of less-attractive women and a couple of gay guys. The workout itself, though, is pretty uninspired; I wonder, too, if a kinestheologist or at least a physician was consulted when they were putting together the routines on display here. Some of them lean too much toward dynamic stretching and look like you could strain a muscle without a proper warm-up (or even with one). Others are painfully hokey, rooted it would seem in some form of unevolved country line dancing. That could just my city slicker bias talking, I admit.

The real value here, though, is for fans of the 'Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters' TV variety show (guilty) who thought that Irlene was the 'cute one' (not that Barbara and Louise didn't have their own appeal, for sure). Also, '80s fitness fashions are still always worth a laugh and a half, not to mention the ungodly amounts of makeup (raccoon eyes!) that Irlene wears throughout the workout. There's a swimming sequence in her pool during the opening montage, and even underwater she's got on what looks like asphalt-thick eyeliner and mascara. Woah! Haha!

We still love you, Irlene.",1369872000,,1872,4.877358490566038
