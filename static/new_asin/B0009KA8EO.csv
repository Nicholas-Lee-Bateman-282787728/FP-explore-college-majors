8062648,5,B0009KA8EO,"El Rapto de Las Sabinas aka Abduction of the Sabine Women. A 1962 Mexico/Spain co-production and filmed in Spain in brilliant Eastmancolor & Mexiscope. The DVD transfer is very good, even truthfully as other reviews mention, the color fades a bit & the sound lowers to almost mute dialogue in some scenes, STILL A VERY ENJOYABLE SWORD & SANDAL FILM WITH PLENTY OF BEEFCAKE ACTORS TO MAKE YOU DROOL!!! The story of the 2 brothers Romulus (Mr. Wolf Ruvinskis BEEFCAKE!!!!) & Remus (Mr. Victor Ruiz BEEFCAKE!!!!) who according to legend had been raised in the wilderness and nourished by a female wolf (GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY GREW UP TO BE BEEFCACKE!!!!!) The 2 brothers are competing to find the sacred hill upon which the ANCIENT CITY OF ROME is to be built. Romulus wins & Remus is killed in the process. Enter second in command Centurion Hoster (Mr. Lex Johnson BEEFCAKE!!!!) who is ordered to find women to populate the now prosperous city of Rome. The Sabine women are choosen but their King will not agree to let the women be the Roman's wives, so the Roman Army abduct the Sabine women by force including the 2 King's duaghters played by the ultra beautiful gorgeous sisters in real life Ms. LORENA VELAZQUEZ (Hersilia) & sensual coquettish catlike Ms. TERE VELAZQUEZ (Rhea). Both sisters & the rest of the female cast bring such beautiful contrast to all the BEEFCAKE TESTOSTERONE FILLED PANORAMA!!!! A movie worth owning for the sheer adventure, spectacle & a trip down memory lane FULL OF BEEFCAKE!!!!! In spanish without english subtitles but with a story that's easy to follow",1430092800,,1585,4.830882352941177

8062651,3,B0009KA8EO,"This curiosity looks almost exactly like the Italian Sword and Sandal movies but it was filmed in Mexico. Handsome leading man Lex Johnson certainly wouldn't look out of place in one of the European productions. The transfer on the DVD is full frame but doesn't appear to be missing much of the picture. And, although it varies a couple of times, for the most part the color is very vibrant. This DVD is Spanish language with no subtitles but the story is easy to follow. It did get a dubbed U.S. theatrical release as The Shame of the Sabine Women but that version seems to have vanished forever.",1395705600,,597,4.537037037037037
8062652,4,B0009KA8EO,"OK Spanish language, Spain/Mexico co-production of the ancient tale of Rome's beginning.  The acting is adequate but the posturing and dialogue seem rather silly and pompous at times.  The quality of the DVD release is pretty good.  The color and picture, for the most part, is clear and bright.  There are only a couple of moments when the color and picture deteriorates slightly and at one point the sound lowers, but I think that is from the master the DVD company acquired.  Other than that this version is worthy of getting.  Recommended.",1394496000,,543,4.8478260869565215

8062654,2,B0009KA8EO,"Was returned because of sound problems in the DVD.  The story, though apparently true historically, was not so well portrayed for the screen. At times seems silly",1372377600,,162,5.0
8062655,5,B0009KA8EO,"if not i have no explanation to why i purchased this. the movie is good, plays well on a dvd player",1325462400,,99,3.761904761904762
