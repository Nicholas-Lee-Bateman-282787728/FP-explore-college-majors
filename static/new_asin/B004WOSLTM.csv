8445514,5,B004WOSLTM,"I find that AGI video's are excellent, well hosted by an Instructor who truly knows His field.  My one criticism, is that these video's need to have practical information on tips like accurizing, and performing trigger jobs.  They instead want you to buy their trigger videos, when I feel that I paid for an Armorer's course, and it should be part of the course.",1453852800,2,362,4.640625
