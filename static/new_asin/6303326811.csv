""Bill"" learns to listen to the heart of his daughter, he learns that ""knowledge brings sorrow"". I know the movie verbatim.  At the end when ""New York"" recites the ""he who sheds his blood today with me shall be my brother......."" almost makes me wanna join up!. Faith is basically what this movie is about.  If it's too ""fluff-filled"" for some, then I don't know what to suggest..!  END",966988800,13,468,4.728395061728395
626524,4,6303326811,"which really isn't a bad thing at all.  ""Renaissance Man"" does a pretty good job of depicting military basic training with a few  laugh-out-loud scenes along the way -- especially the  ""sniff-n-git"" approach to chow time (what great memories!).  I  especially liked Gregory Hines' character (Drill Sergeant Cass) emphasizing  the daunting task of transforming civilians into soldiers capable of saving  lives in combat.  Sergeant Cass and Bill Rago may come from entirely  different perspectives, but, like one of the primary goals of military  basic training, the two men realize they're on the same team and gradually  develop a respect for each other's duty.
I also liked the scene where  Private Benitez, who does a dead-on Jake LaMotta impression throughout the  movie, presents a moving soliloquy from Henry V during his company's  bivouac (""on St. Crispin's Day"").  Mark Wahlberg (who I suppose  graduated basic training and moved on to ""Three Kings""!), the  lovely Stacey Dash (who isn't given enough to do) and the wonderfully  restrained Richard T. Jones (Private Jackson Leroy) round out a solid cast.  A few minor things prevent this from being a 5-star movie (I actually give  it 4 1/2 stars):
1)  I felt sorry for the soldier (Private Hobbs) who was  busted for his past history of selling drugs -- but hey, he didn't seem too  sorry about it when he got caught, did he?  At least he was trying to  better himself in the slammer... 2)  The ""white boys ain't got no  rhythm"" crack is pretty played out (even if it is true). 3)  I was  disappointed not to find ""United"", the track played during the  closing credits, on the soundtrack.  Great song!
Last item -- they way  the movie ended, it sort of left the door open for a follow-up of some  sort.  Was there a TV series made of this (I've been overseas for a LONG  time!)  Hope someone can answer this in a future review.",966988800,22,1886,4.748447204968944
626525,4,6303326811,"This movie was nearly as good as ""Dead Poets Society.""  I am glad to be inspired by another movie that shows how effective education can  be.  Danny DeVito touched my heart as he turned ""illiterate""  soldiers on to great literature in a down-to-earth way, surrounded by the  rigid military protocol.

I also enjoyed the story of the father/daughter  relationship in which the father wakes up to his daughter's beauty, and  comes around to support her individuality.",966124800,7,465,5.026315789473684
626526,5,6303326811,I have just watched this movie on the TV.  I can honestly say this touched me.  I remember Shakespear from school and pushed me back.  I only  wish this was on DVD.  Devito is great finally coming round to what all must see  as a fine portrayal of a teacher caring for his students.  I have seen it  in other movies yet I can honestly say I was clasping my hands as each 'DD'  reached his conclusion on Hamlet. Great movie...,953856000,4,425,4.148148148148148
626527,5,6303326811,"I watched this movie and immediately fell in love with it, not only because I am studying english, but because it has great morals in it and it a very movie that is suprisingly clean for movies of this day and age.

626528,5,6303326811,"""Renaissance Man"" is incredibly funny, but also sad at times. It gives off a good message. Not only are there the obvious morals taught in this great comedy, but you also learn three new words in it! Mark Wahlberg  does an outstanding job in ""Renaissance Man"", also.",946166400,5,266,4.659574468085107

7843838,5,6303326811,"I simply adored this movie with Danny De Vito!  I really cracked up with the scene where he goes up the victory tower and has to come down.  I also love Lillo Brancato and his impersonations of ""Scarface"" and the ""Raging Bull.""  I'm not a real Shakespeare fan, but I admit that I definitely got into this movie.  Danny is on my top 10 of favorites.",1080432000,,348,4.2272727272727275
7843839,5,6303326811,"This movie is so fantastic. It is deep, yet humorous. It teaches so many lessons of life. Buy it and watch it often to remind yourself of those lessons that we should never forget. Definitely a realistic, feel good movie that holds your attention the whole time.  Spectacular performance by Danny DeVito.",1046217600,,304,4.846153846153846
7843840,5,6303326811,"Danny DeVito was perfect for his character as Bill Rago. The story is about an unemployed man who becomes a teacher in the Army to train eight iffy soldiers. DeVito's job is to teach his kids to comprehend. The thing is, if DeVito fails, that's it for these guys, they're out of the Army and out of a job. DeVito instructs the kids early in the film to bring something to read to class. Then a soldier asks DeVito what he was reading. He responds, ""Hamlet."" One of the soldiers then identifies the book as a story about a little bitty pig. But as anyone knows it is written by Shakespear. The kids show great interest in it. The film goes on and DeVito starts to bond with the kids he once hated.
DeVito had been typecasted as a man who is halfway good/halfway bad due to his roll in ""Taxi,"" but he shows his true acting talent here in this film. Rent it, it's a great movie.",1040428800,,875,4.214285714285714
7843841,5,6303326811,"Like these others, I find it amazing that people don't see the value in this movie. Bill Rago takes folks who can't see their own value, and by challenging them to see the truths in other lives (specifically the characters in Hamlet and Henry V), opens the world of opportunity. I have seen this over 10 times, and the bivouac scene where Benetez quotes the St. Crispin Day speech, about warriors and the brotherhood between them, never fails to make me tear up. These ""DD"" squad members, whom everyone, including their drill sergeant, thinks are losers, understand the real meaning of shared experience. And so will you, if you watch this film.",1007251200,5,645,4.767857142857143
7843842,5,6303326811,"I am not in the habit of buying videos to keep, but I had to buy this one.  I'm sure I've seen it 10 times by now.  Whoever said that Shakespeare is hard to read is not remembering that Shakespeare started out as drama for the masses, not for the literati of his day.
This movie has been overlooked, which is a real shame.  Definitely what you would call a sleeper.  I never get tired of seeing it.",994464000,28,398,4.064102564102564
7843843,5,6303326811,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FILM.  IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY TOP FIVE ALL-TIME FAVORITES.  WE HAVE THE PREMIUM CABLE CHANNELS AND EVERYTIME IT IS ON, MY HUSBAND AND I END UP WATCHING IT AND I CRY EACH TIME DURING SEVERAL OF THE SCENES. IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST TRIUMPHANT ""FEEL-GOOD"" MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.  YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH EVERY ONE OF THE SUPPORTING CAST MEMBERS.  HOW MANY MOVIES CAN YOU SAY THAT ABOUT?
THE MOVIE HAS THE HEART OF SUCH MOVIES AS ""AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN"" AND ""TO SIR WITH LOVE"".  IN RENAISSANCE MAN, THE STORY DOES NOT FOCUS ON THE ROMANCE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN, BUT RATHER THE ROMANCE BETWEEN A TEACHER AND HIS STUDENTS.
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!",992649600,3,701,4.320610687022901
7843844,3,6303326811,"The thing that makes ""Renaissance Man"" a less-than-worthy film is its overly long running time. Throughout the movie, one gets the notion that there is a lot of good underlying material that is just bursting to break free, but never gets a chance to. The laughs are there, but there don't seem to be nearly enough of them to keep it a comedy. By the movie's end, it seems more like a weird combination of morals and laughs mixed into an army storyline whose characters never fully express the message of the film.
Bill Rego is a highly successful advertising businessman whose recent divorce has left him broke, down on his luck, and late to work everyday. After being fired from his job, he is forced to take many trips to the unemployment office, where his conversations with the clerk, while aiming for comedy, seem to be forced and unenjoyable for both actors. By this point in the movie, I was trying so hard to try and find something funny to laugh at, and maybe that's the movie's problem: we are forced to look for the laughs instead of having them look for us.
His job hunt takes him to an army base, where he is given the assignment of teaching a group of trainees who have apparently scoring big in the underachievment category. I really wish that the movie would have elaborated more on exactly why they were in that position in the first place. They are all seen in the fields doing their things with their guns and running in place, so why does the chief of headquarters see it fit to place them in the classroom with a man who has no experience as a teacher? The students are just as blind ot the answer as we are.
Rego has no idea what to teach them, or how to react to them. Each of the students comes from a different area of the country, each being a stereotype of a different social circle in the areas they lived in. When they all stand up and deliver a speech about their background, this seems to be a sign that the movie is going to get better, but don't count on it. From here on out, Rego preaches the verses of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" to them, supposedly insighting them with lyrical phrases and expanding their minds. And how exactly is this supposed to help them when they're out on the fields, practicing the art of war?
The whole ""Hamlet"" angle is just one of the many contrivances of the movie's plot, which seems to jump from comedy to drama within minute-long periods. It goes through an identity crisis, so to speak, of trying to decide which one it wants to be, and in the end ends up being neither. There are some genuine laughs that will tickle your fancy, and Danny Devito certainly does a goos job in trying to bring the story a sense of lightheartedness, but this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, and he is unable to keep it from flopping.
It's a slight surprise to see that the director of this film is Penny Marshall, whose past films such as ""A League of Their Own"" and ""Big"" each contained a healthy balance of drama and comedy. Here, she seems to want to give it to us in increments, not wanting us to forget that this is not just a comedy, but a drama as well, and vice versa. It's as if she's forcing this fact down our throats through the movie, and this makes it almost painstaking to watch.
While there are some laughs, ""Renaissance Man"" falls into the category of films that have a lot going for it, but never make it off the ground. There are too many nonessential elements within the film that keep it from obtaining a good combination of the ones we really want to see, and it seems to drag on longer than it needs to.",984787200,5,3595,4.359165424739195
