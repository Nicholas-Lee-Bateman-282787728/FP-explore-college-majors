8215216,4,B000UVV27Y,"All discs are included in the season.  However; disc number 2 is mislabeled when the disc is started in the player.  The opening page on disc 2 is labeled disc 3 and this caused some confusion when I started watching the program.  This is no fault of the seller.  Other than that, the items were received in a timely manner and in good shape.",1295740800,,342,4.296875
8215217,4,B000UVV27Y,"I bought this without ever seeing the show on tv.  This is a three disc set with only ten shows.  They seem to be out of order based on the previews of upcoming events.  When you get to the last two shows I would watch 10 (the finals) then 9 (legends).  I was a little confused on the presentation of the show due to coverage of the hands.  They continue to play during commercials and all you get is highlights.  The show did help me to improve my Blackjack skills and I'm a better player for it.  The DVD's seem to vibrate inside my player during menu screens even when I stop the DVD.  I hope it doesn't harm my player, besides that this is a nice set.",1200960000,3,655,4.0625
