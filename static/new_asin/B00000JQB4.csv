1236375,5,B00000JQB4,"I have bought a lot of aerobics videos in the past, and none of them have made me feel as good as Rich Grogan's Kick to Get Fit. Rich shows very detailed instruction on how to properly do each move, he even tells you the  muscles you are working. Throughout the video Rich show you easier ways to  do some of the advanced movements, which is great for me since I am a  beginner. Since I started doing Rich Grogan's Kick to Get Fit I have begun  feeling a lot better about myself. Rich just makes you feel good about  yourself, and he makes you feel good about exercising, which has kept me  doing the video. Oh did I mention that I have lost 3 pants sizes, and 25  pounds in just 4 weeks. That might have something to do with me feeling  better about myself. If you want to start feeling better about yourself, I  strongly recommend Rich Grogan's Kick to Get Fit. Thank you very much Rich,  my life has diffently changed for the better.",962236800,,936,4.237288135593221
1236376,5,B00000JQB4,"This is video is everything I have been looking for in a workout video. Rich Grogan has set a pace for not only me but for my kids to follow along with. He seems to have the understanding that not everybody is in 100%  great shape, so he helps you through the workout by showing you easier ways  to do the movements. My kids and I love this video, I just wish I would  have found it sooner and not spent all the money on other videos, like  Tae-BO. Thanks Rich, I can't wait for your next video.",961545600,,495,4.020408163265306
1236377,5,B00000JQB4,"I started using the Kick to Get Fit video about 5 weeks ago. In that time I have seen my stomach flatten and my arms and legs take shape. I have never had a lot of muscle tone, and over the years I have put on some extra  unwanted weight. It is nice to find an exercise program that men can follow  along with, and more importantly men can see results from. Thanks Rich",958262400,,369,3.972972972972973
1236378,5,B00000JQB4,"I have been exercising fairly consistantly for the past 3 years. In that time I have bought a lot of different exercise videos, all promising the same thing, that I would lose weight in a couple of weeks. I have found  that you have to be in super shape in order to keep up with most of these  videos. But, the Kick to Get Fit video, for me was very easy to follow, and  very effective. I believe that the reason the video is so effective is  because Rich shows you a variety of ways to follow along with the  exercises. To me, this is very important, because with the other tapes I  was unable to follow along, so I quit using them. I've been doing Kick to  Get Fit for 3 weeks and I have already lost 3 pants sizes and 12 pounds. I  can't wait to see what changes happen after 6 weeks. Kick to Get Fit is the  video for me.",958262400,2,825,3.981707317073171
1236379,5,B00000JQB4,"I recently bought a copy of ""kick to get fit"" kickboxing aerobics videotape.  I really enjoyed the workout.  I have many, many other aerobics tapes and never use them after the first week.  The kickboxing  aerobics tape that Rich Grogan came up with adds meaning to the workout.  My favorite aspects of the tape are the self defence applications to the  actual aerobics moves.  The workout is also geared for various levels.  At  first I was only able to complete the ""beginner"" movements/  techniques and now I have advanced to the ""intermediate"".  I  would highly recommend the ""Kick to  get fit "" videotape.",957052800,,610,4.805825242718447
1236380,1,B00000JQB4,If you're looking for an instructional video this is for you. We just liked Tae Bo Kicks(for kids) and we're looking for something similar(more of an aerobics video for kids versus instructional). We did not find the warm-up enjoyable and stopped watching. We actually didn't make it past the second session. I'm just warning you he lacks the enthusiasm and energy we found with Billy Blanks. I felt I was watching a gym class....,1424995200,4,430,4.824324324324325
1236381,5,B00000JQB4,great!,1424822400,,6,6.0
1236382,2,B00000JQB4,This is a very boring and quite short exercise video for kids. Extremely overpriced for what is on the DVD.  Can't imagine we'll watch it a 2nd time  .l am donating it to the library.,1422403200,3,183,4.2
1236383,5,B00000JQB4,Fun work out for kids. Great for  part of a Home School PE program.,1410912000,2,67,3.7857142857142856
1236384,4,B00000JQB4,"I purchased this for my son who is 6 to help him develop his abs and have fun while exercising.  The reviews were good so I gave it a try.  My son actually asks to do this video and wants to do it every day.  It is easy for kids to do the moves, he explains everything very well, it doesn't move to fast, and the moves are fun for kids.  I have also joined in with him and it gives a good workout.  My son already feels stronger and it makes him feel good about himself.  It's not the most professional video I have ever seen but it works.  The man on the video is very personable, he isn't perfect,  he is encouraging and let's the kids know to just do the best they can do.  I highly recommend this!",1397692800,3,701,3.9148936170212765
1236385,4,B00000JQB4,"This is the best paced DVD for my son, who is 5. Other ones (I also ordered danceX) are too fast/loud, and don't explain each move clearly or slowly enough. Rich Grogan comes across as the ideal soccer coach, has a reassuring style, and does moves that just about anyone can do. This mom is also getting a good workout! If you watch it lots of times, it gets annoying to keep hearing the same explanation of why he's not using martial arts terminology at the beginning. Basically, instead of fighting moves, he teaches them as ""picking apples from trees"" or ""making apple pie."" He could have done this without having to explain it. But I give it very high marks.",1395878400,3,662,4.479338842975206
1236386,3,B00000JQB4,My kids - ages five and ten did this video once and won't do it again.  They found it kinda boring.,1395705600,2,99,3.7142857142857144
1236387,4,B00000JQB4,"I bought this for my almost 4 yr old son as an indoor activity to do inside to burn off some of his excess energy with all of the snow. He really seems to like doing my workout videos with me and I thought that he would like this. We did it this weekend with him for the first time. He was not very good at paying attention (says more about him than the video) there were times that he would participate and other times that he just jumped around. My husband and I followed along and the workout seemed to get our heart rates up and blood pumping so I would think that it would be good from that respect.

I gave this four stars because the host kind of seemed to irritate my husband more than me. I did not have a problem with him, but I don't think this is a video that my husband could watch more than a few times. With that said, this is directed at kids and not at my husband so I am fine with that.

Overall it was a nice workout and I think given a little more time my little one will pick up on it more and more.",1392595200,,1020,3.875598086124402
1236388,5,B00000JQB4,"This video was my 9 year old's choice to get started and move!  It is challenging for her and entertaining for me to move with her.  I appreciate Rich saying out loud what the actual moves are in sparing and making them fruit friendly:)  We are really enjoying this as we move toward more active lives.  Thank you!

1236389,4,B00000JQB4,"This DVD is simple, but works for my 9 and 12 year old boys right now.  We have owned the video a few months and use it a couple of times a week, and they are not tired of it yet.  Rich has a relaxed and friendly personality and teaches self defense moves without emphasizing aggression.  It is only 35 minutes which may become an issue when the kiddos want more variety in the future.",1385251200,4,385,4.1066666666666665
1236400,1,B00000JQB4,"This workout was hard for me to watch!  I tried to do it with my kids, but we got bored...FAST!
The idea is ok, but just not done very well.",1376006400,,140,3.6666666666666665
1236401,4,B00000JQB4,My younger kids liked this. They think it's fun and stay engaged in the movements. It is a bit short though but as long as it gets my kids moving it's doing it's job. To juvenile for older kids though. I would say age group of about 4-8 would enjoy it.,1374537600,3,252,3.9607843137254903
1236402,5,B00000JQB4,I would highly recommend it for kids.  My boy enjoyed it and I did as well.  I is a great keep fit program!,1368921600,,107,3.608695652173913
1236403,4,B00000JQB4,"KICK is ok, need to keep searching for something they will actually like to do, I think the exercises were good I even did the DVD with them and, however I liked it, but its not about me it was about my girlies that's the only reason why I gave it a four ;0). Mom/dad can add this to their routine, the workout had my arms burning during an aching afterwards #good thing.",1368489600,,371,4.095890410958904
1236404,4,B00000JQB4,I have 2 young boys ages 3 & 5.  They love the dvd.  The 3 year old can not do most of the moves correctly but is still able to understand the concept and tries his best.  The 5 year old enjoys it very much.  It helps to re-inforce that exercise is important and healthy.  It is nice to have this around for days we can't go outside or do another physical activity.,1366848000,5,365,3.9452054794520546
1236405,4,B00000JQB4,I like this video. It provides a good workout for people of all ages. I bought it for my nine-year-old. I also bought the 6 Fit Kids Video and didn't care for it at all.,1364169600,,169,3.857142857142857
1236406,2,B00000JQB4,"First of all, my kids lost interest very quickly.  Second, I realize he's trying to make these moves nonviolent, but he starts by telling you what the real move is and then says he's going to call it something less violent.  That defeats the purpose and also seemed condescending.  We've only used it once.  I gave it 2 stars because it is a decent workout, but not worth the money in my opinion!",1363305600,6,396,4.383561643835616
1236407,4,B00000JQB4,"I bought this DVD for my son.  He is 3.  So far he is not into it.  I do the video to set a good example.  The workout makes me feel better and I break a sweat.  I hope as he gets older he will show more interest.  So far he prefers yoga, especially the DVDs that include animals or letters.",1360022400,,291,3.6885245901639343
1236408,3,B00000JQB4,"I loved this for my son, but he didn't get into it. The instructor is great, very engaging. If he were live in person, kids would love him.",1359158400,,139,4.0
1236409,4,B00000JQB4,"There needs to be more DVDs like this.  The child I got this for is able to keep up and can't tell that it's too hard since there are actually kids doing the workouts rather than her trying to do my workouts with me.  I definitely recommend this.  (It is corny, but hey, it's for kids)",1358553600,,285,4.053571428571429
1236410,5,B00000JQB4,"Purchased this dvd for my non-athletic  (somewhat lazy) 9 year old son.  I thought he could do this in the afternoons, after he finishes his homework, and I am encouraging him to have some sort of physical activity daily. He loves this dvd!  Not too easy, not so hard he is frustrated or tripping over his own feet. Hopefully habits started early will remain.....",1346025600,,363,4.640625
1236411,1,B00000JQB4,"This is the MOST BORING DVD I have ever seen in my entire life. No one can expect a good workout from this nonsense.  I understand that this is geared toward kids, but, don't we want them to get SOMETHING out of it?  This is S L O W and boring. The instructor is boring, the music is boring, the kids are boring, and not in sync.  I bought this for my daughter and she HATES it.  Even my four yr old hates this, I hate  this.  Save yr money.",1342569600,7,441,3.8444444444444446
1236412,5,B00000JQB4,This video keeps my students moving !!  A great incentive for getting my students to WANT TO MOVE.  We enjoy it everyday when they come to P.E. Class.  Thank you very much.,1341187200,,172,4.3125
1236413,4,B00000JQB4,"My son has a developmental disability.  His doctor suggested martial arts classes for him, so  we tried formal classes.  They were very expensive, and the instructor was just rude to him,  but my son wanted to keep trying ""karate"".  This video has been great for him.  The instructor is fun and pleasant with the children in the video.  The moves are fun, but my son is definitely developing coordination, control, and some self- discipline.  He smiles and laughs the whole way through.  He was afraid of failing at the beginning, but after a couple times, I could see that he was really gaining confidence.  I sometimes do this with him on rainy days, and it's a decent work out, too.  There is some basic self defense at the end, and that's a plus. I suggest it for any family that wants to get their kids up and moving and have a little fun!",1337644800,2,844,4.450980392156863
1236414,5,B00000JQB4,"My son is in Taekwondo and I wanted something to keep him moving and gaining strength, flexibility, and coordination on the weekends.  This DVD is perfect.  It is great exercise and reinforces basics martial arts movements in a non threatening way but as a TKD student he instantly recognized the movements and it reinforced what he is learning in class from his Master.  I did the DVD along with him and I was winded and feeling my muscles getting a work out.  the choreography is easy to follow along with and fun, I highly recommend this for family workouts.",1333152000,,561,4.636363636363637
1236415,5,B00000JQB4,I have tried this with my 2 yr old daughter and no she does not do the moves as is but she very much loves to try!! I realize the instructor speaks to the adults and not really the kids but I do not mind one bit since I do the video with my daughter; I believe kids learn by example and it makes me sweat too!! I would highly recommend! have fun with it and the kids will too!!,1329091200,,377,3.725
1236416,5,B00000JQB4,"I originally purchased this dvd for my 5 and 8 yr old sons to stay active (and expend some energy) at home during times when the weather wasn't cooperative for outdoor play. This fitness DVD was exactly what I was looking for to help keep my kids active and healthy- I am so happy with this purchase! They absolutely love working out to this dvd. Rich relates to the students around him and the kids at home very well. The exercises are fun and non-violent as described, and really get the kids sweating! The exercises are not too difficult even for younger kids but challenging enough that they do get some good cardio! The boys also love the instructor's martial arts demonstration at the end. Overall, it's very enjoyable for kids! It's so important to give children positive outlets for all their energy and to set the tone for staying healthy and fit as they grow up. This dvd is a win-win for children and parents/caregivers!",1328572800,3,931,4.614457831325301
1236417,4,B00000JQB4,"my 8 year old daughter loves it, I do it with her too.  Sometimes she even plays it twice! The 'names' he gives the moves are fun too, she says it's fun being healthy",1328486400,,166,3.8823529411764706
1236418,5,B00000JQB4,"We got this for our 11, 9, 7 and 4-year-olds and they LOVE it! It's just the right length of time, enough challenge to keep the oldest child's interest, yet adaptable for little ones. It's hard to find ""P.E."" opportunities when homeschooling, so this really helped us! Homeschooling moms are hard pressed to find the time to work out, so sometimes I jump right in with the kids! We are very happy with this DVD!",1327276800,5,411,4.493333333333333
1236419,5,B00000JQB4,"My boys probably wouldn't dig a workout video in and of itself.  But the fact that it's led by a well built martial artist and done with martial arts movements, they think they are building muscles like him and kickin butt like a karate dude.  It's been nearly a year owning this video and they still get it out on occasion and get a work out.  I like having it available to them....epecially in the winter months or rainy days when they are indoors more often.",1323388800,3,461,4.337209302325581

For the money, I would advise to find another video.",1303257600,8,291,3.661290322580645
1236461,5,B00000JQB4,"WOW!!!!  This is a great DVD- easily kept my 12 year olds attention.  Instructor was very energetic and entertaining.  User friendly, and motivational..... and had us BOTH sweating.  My highest rating!",1301270400,2,201,5.387096774193548
1236462,4,B00000JQB4,"My 9-1/2 year old daughter likes the "" self defense moves"" the instructor does. She said it also has ""good exercise moves"". I enjoy doing it with her.

1236463,4,B00000JQB4,"I purchased this item for use in a 5th grade classroom. PROS-The video is kid friendly, motivating, age-appropriate, and culturally diverse. CONS-Limited routines and a bit heavy on the self-defense portions(more exhibitionism than participation on the kids part).",1295654400,,264,5.973684210526316
1236464,5,B00000JQB4,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas after reading several reviews of kids workout DVDs.  I'm so happy we got this.  Him and I used it for the first time a few nights ago and it is simple enough for my son, a six year old, but worth it for adults too (my calves were on FIRE!).

My husband and I usually work out with her, and we definitely ""feel the burn"" when we are done. The kicks and punches are thoroughly explained and mixed in with other kid-friendly movements (like ""running to the cafeteria for lunch"" and hopping). Just when you think you can't hop one more time.....you switch to the cool-down.

1236523,1,B00000JQB4,This DVD is disappointing and condescending to children who are fairly robotic. Grogan makes side comments to adults and the music does not fit activity. There are much better options out there. The aerobic component is not well organized or sustained. I will not use this in PE classes or classrooms in my school.,1202860800,8,314,4.833333333333333

1236525,5,B00000JQB4,This is a very good video.  My son loves it.  The instructions are clear and my son is able to follow and perform the instructions without any problems.  He let the children jump like children and not like an adult precise jump.  The children performing with him are also very good to watch.  If you are buying this video you can also buy Billy Blanks Tae Bo for Kicks.  Tae Bo for Kicks is the best of the best.  It's excellent.  Tae Bo for Kicks is my son's favorite.  The music is upbeat and it's simply great fun.  You won't be disappointed with any of these videos.  Kick to Get Fit Jr. also provide a couple of child protection tips at the end.,1200009600,3,650,4.203252032520325

The moves are simple and some of the things we learned in elementary school P.E. classes, but all together they make for a FUN workout session.  I have been working out faithfully for over 7 years, and I want my kids to start while they are young, and this is good way to help them.

She is very active and in the winter time I wanted something to keep her active between soccer seasons (even though she is doing some basketball)-- like I said, she likes to be active.  When I first got this dvd, she had a cast on her foot and then progressed to a brace but she was able to do parts of the workout even with those limitations.  She is thrilled now that she can do all of it without limitations.  She and a friend have done the workout together as well and had fun.

The first night she even did it twice. My eleven year old however is not as interested.

The video is also split up (for example, Warm Up and Cool Down) so it is easy to pause and grab a drink of water if you need one.",1151366400,16,433,4.130952380952381

Rich Grogan seems to be just like some of the father's I know around town, making silly mistakes in his routine.  He's real.  I found the workout to be easy enough for my 5 year old daughter to follow and challenging enough for me to get a good workout.  I have never been able to follow a video workout before.  This was great and enjoyable.  Both my daughters and I enjoy the workout and get more out of it each time we do it AND it doesn't require a lot of space.

My kids have seen their share of kid's exercise programs, and until we saw this one, they weren't very happy with any of them. This program really makes them feel good about themselves, and really makes them feel good about exercising.

- A couple of quick points that make this program so special are; the instructor, the program itself, and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having, and the amount of fun my children have doing the program. - The instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program, and also to the viewers at home. He is funny, but yet professional with his instruction, and really does a good job with the kids. - The program itself is like nothing I've ever seen before, the movements are a combination of karate techniques (with a non-violent approach), aerobic movements, and basic physical education activities, it's a very nice blend, and it really flows together well. - And last, but certainly not least, this program is FUN to do, and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with.

I usually don't write reviews, simple because most of the kid's fitness programs I've seen aren't worth the time to write about. But, Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, is completely different than anything I've ever seen. The film quality was very good, and the instructor did such a great job interacting with the kids, he's truly a natural with kids. One of the things I liked best about this program was the tempo & flow, and the way the instructor just seemed to flow with the program. What I mean is, it didn't appear that he had  memorized a script (of what to say) or that he was reading word for word from a script, he just went with the flow. And, any one of us who has ever worked with kids before knows that you have to be natural with kids in order to make it fun, anything less than that will effect the quality of what you're doing. - Now, don't get me wrong, this program was well rehearsed & extremely well put together, but the instructor & kids were truly going with the flow & having fun. - Which is definitely more appealing to the kids watching the program. - Kids enjoy watching kids having fun, and if the kids on the program are having fun, then the kids watching want to participate so that they can have just as much fun. It doesn't get much simpler than this, unfortunately most programs have no understanding of this concept and fall way short.

""Oh no"" I thought, "" there's no one he can relate to in this video . . . this won't work.""  Yet that was not the case. He didn't want me to turn off ""Kick.""  It's absolutely true what I read in the other reviews: the program is great !!  The steps are easy to follow and the instructor RELATES TO KIDS. I was amazed. When I asked my son what he liked about ""Kick,"" he said ""it's fun; it's for kids. . . and maybe I can lose my stomach."" I also purchased the Denise Austin Kids video and was disappointed. And I didn't want to try TaeBo for kids; if TaeBo hurts me, just think what it would do for my child.  Any hoot, ""Kick"" is worth buying.

Now this is a program for kids. This guy, Rich Grogan, is truly very comfortable working with kids, and it is clearly displayed on this program. He is very natural with the kids, and is truly having a good time. The kids on this program are feeding off of his fun, caring nature and are having a lot of fun themselves. My kids picked up on this right away. Also, the movements in this program are very kid friendly, and very appropriate for kids. My family has tried several different kid's fitness programs (including the kid's Tae-Bo, which was very poor). Out of all the programs we've seen, this video stands alone as my family's favorite.

This is a great program, performed by a very fun loving ""kids"" fitness professional.",1119657600,9,739,4.633587786259542
1236646,5,B00000JQB4,"This program is terrific for physical education classes, and it's terrific for my kids at home.

As a P.E. teacher I'm always looking for new & exciting things to do with my students, and I've got quite the collection of books, videos & now DVDs. I came across this program, and read that Mr. Grogan is also a P.E. teacher, and a Martial Arts & Fitness instructor, so I thought with that type of background, and all the positive reviews from others, this DVD was a must try.

And try I did, and try I have, many, many times. My kids love this program. Some of my classes, and even my kids at home often ask to do the ""apple picking"" program. (You'll have to watch the DVD to understand what I'm talking about). This program offers a complete head to toe workout, everything from strecthing, to push ups, to apple grapping, to kicking, to jumping, running, and even a cool down, and the amazing part is, it is all done at a child's level. But don't be fooled into thinking it's super slow & boring, because it's not. It's just the correct speed for the kids to keep up with (which gives them one heck of a workout), while having fun. Also, the kids on this program, are just normal everyday kids, and they make small little goof ups from time to time, which in my opinion adds to the greatness of this program. Because students watching in P.E. class, and my kids at home can relate with these kids just being kids & having fun. To many times people forget that kids are kids, and that kids need to have fun & do the best they can, meaning - Kid's are not adults!

All in all, I think this is one of the best programs I've come across, and I've seen my share!",1115510400,27,1658,4.257142857142857
1236647,5,B00000JQB4,"This is probably the best program I've ever seen for kids, it is simply the best. I read a review about this program in a magazine, so I thought I would give it a try, since my kids are always wanting to try new things. From the moment we popped the DVD in, my kids were glued to the screen. They watched Mr. Grogan & the kids on the screen, and followed along to EVERY movement. It was pretty amazing to see! I even got up & did most of the movements with my kids. I can't believe how easy it is to follow along with the movements in this program, but at the same time, how much of a workout it provides. This is a pretty amazing concept, and one that is rare in any type of exercise program - the ability to have a program that is very easy to follow along to, but also provides a very good workout. Another terrific point about this video is Mr. Grogan's interaction with the kids, he is just clearly having fun with the kids & the movements, and it comes across as being very natural. Which is probably another reason why my kids absolutely love this video. Kids can tell the difference when someone is really having fun, and when they're just going through the motions.

My kids & I have tried a couple of other kid's exercise videos - The Denise Austin kid's video & the Tae-Bo kid's video, and to be honest we were pretty dis-appointed. These videos, even though they were done by well known fitness professionals, didn't have a very good feel for kids, nor was it very easy to follow along with. As a matter of fact, both of these videos were very close to being a complete duplicate of some of Denise Austin & Tae-Bo's other videos who are designed for adults. Kids are kids, and movements in a kid's video should be for kids. These two should stick to what they're good at, and it's NOT making videos for kids. Leave that to Mr. Grogan, who is one of the best at working with kids. One more thing that probably helps Mr. Grogan in his kid's video is the fact that he is a physical education teacher, and a Martial Arts instructor, so he has hands on experience working with kids everyday. This type of experience is very evident & clearly displayed within this program.",1110585600,141,2179,4.288834951456311

Or atleast the programs say they are for kids, and then my kids try to attempt the movements, and find that most adults couldn't do the movements.

Anyway, this program is great, and I'm not sure what some of the other viewers mean by saying this program wasn't very well done. This program is for kids, so it should be kid friendly, meaning the instructor should have a loose & playful personality, because this is the only way to interact with kids. Kids want to have fun, and there is NO better way to get kids moving than to be loose, energetic, and fun natured. Mr. Grogan covers all these areas, and does a terrific job at it. And the kids certainly pick up on it. This is the only fitness program I have that the kids actually ask to do it, that in itself is amazing to me.

They love it and even want to have their friends over to workout with them.  They don't even complain when I remind them to do their workout.  This is a huge step in our household.

No, it is not done to perfection, but that is the part I like best.  It makes it very real to life.  My boys don't have to feel like they must do it perfectly (a big plus when you have a perfectionist).  It frees them up to just have fun getting fit.",1107993600,65,706,3.9785714285714286

My school district is made up of 10 gradeschools, so needless to say, there is a large number of teachers, parents & students involved within this district. I reviewed this video at a physical education conference, and was 100% sold on the ideas & concepts. I was in one of Mr. Grogan's demonstrations, which had about 200 P.E. teachers in the crowd. Let me tell you, I've been involved with physical education, school systems, and children for the past 25 years, and I don't think I've EVER seen the response given to a program the way people responded to this one. The word AWESOME doesn't even come close to describing the amount of fun we had with this program. So of course I bought a DVD for each one of the gradeschools in the district. And, without any surprise to me, I've received numerous phones calls from the teachers & parents as to how much they LOVE this program. The way Mr. Grogan interacts with the kids in the video, and the way he makes the viewers feel like they are part of the class is amazing. He is truly a professional in the art of teaching & interacting with children, and believe me, I've seen my share of poor teachers, especially poor P.E. teachers, who simply took the job as a P.E. teacher because they couldn't do anything else. Anybody who is serious about being a good teacher, especially with children, will quickly see how amazing Mr. Grogan's positive interaction is with the children in the video.

Mr. Grogan also explains in the video why he has changed some of the movements to eliminate the violent characteristics of punching & kicking. Mr. Grogan explains, instead of doing a cross punch, have the children pretend to grab apples, this will take the focus off of punching another student on the playground. But, by keeping the muscle mechanics the same as a punch, but simply changing the intent & meaning of the punch, the kids can still gain the positive benefits involved in throwing a punching technique. To actually see the kids on the playground saying & playing grab the apples & oranges, making apple pie & orange juice is pretty amazing to see. To fully understand this you'll have to see the video for yourself. And believe me, not only will you be impressed, but your kids will absolutely love the program and they will also impress you with the way they remember the movements, and how they often ask to do this program.

And of course the movements are something amazing to. First of all the kids stay moving during the entire program, but the movements are simple enough to keep up with, and very easy to do, and all at the same time fun & exciting enough to keep the kids interested.

1236684,5,B00000JQB4,"It is pretty difficult for me to say something is the best. I am VERY PICKY, and with the exercise & fitness industry I am also very leary, because there are SOOOO many BAD programs available. Some programs are being taught by people who should NOT be in the fitness industry, and these same people try to create programs for children, which is even a bigger blunder. Children are different than adults, because they're children, this sounds simple enough for parents, but most children's programs I've tried for my kids are adult oreinted. Probably the worst program is Tae-Bo Jr. This program was almost a direct repeat of the regular Tae-Bo program, but with kids TRYING, I repeat TRYING to do the movements. Kids are kids, they need to be treated & respected as kids, especially with something as important as exercise.

This program - Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, is like nothing I've ever seen. To start with, Rich Grogan, the guy conducting the program, actually has experience with children. He is physical education teacher, a Martial Arts instructor, and a personal trainer, and his best quality (as if this isn't enough), he has a TERRIFIC connection with the children in his video. These kids are truly having fun, and are genuinely happy about doing this program. This comes through VERY CLEARLY on the screen, and is immediately picked up on by my children. Kids who see other kids having fun, want to immediately join in on the fun.

This program provides a challenge for the kids, BUT isn't TOO CHALLENGING. The movements are very easy to follow, and extremely fun to do, I've done the program a number of times with my kids, and it gives me a pretty good workout. We do everything from jumping jacks, push ups, grabbing apples & oranges (This is Rich's twist on doing punches & uppercuts), to riding a horse, and running to the cafeteria. This program is fun and my kids love it, they actually ask OFTEN to do the ""Kids Kick video"".

From a proud parent, and from 3 happy kids, we give this program 8 thumbs up. That's 2 thumbs a piece!!!!!",1101254400,12,2060,4.622950819672131

1236718,5,B00000JQB4,"This is absolutely the most incredible program I've EVER seen. I generally don't write reviews, because most exercise programs I've seen don't deserve the time it takes to write one. So if I'm taking the time to write this one, let me tell you it is worth it. The words incredible, great, and excellent don't even come close to describing this program, I just couldn't think of any more powerful words to use.
The guy on this video, Rich Grogan, has really got something with this program. First of all he is fun, and entertaining for the kids. And the kids that are actually in the video are having fun (genuine fun, none of this paid actors fun), they're feeding off of Rich's positive energy, and having a good time with it. This is one of the major hooks that pulls you in, these kids are glowing with fun, energy, and excitement, and it is basically thrown into your living room when you watch the video. My kids at home can't just sit on the couch and watch this program, they have to get up and actually do the program. It is almost like some super-natural force grabs them and pulls them on the floor to begin exercising with Rich & the kids. I know this may sound strange, and I am sure some people are saying to themselves, ""there is NO way my kid would be this excited about an exercise program"". Well, I'm telling you it is true. And, it's not like my kids have only watched the program once or twice, we have basically wore out our VHS copy, and that is why we bought the DVD, which is even better, because now we can skip through to certain parts of the program when we are short on time. What I've been doing in the mornings, before summer camp, I'll get the kids up and pick a section of the video (DVD) and have them do that section before we leave for summer camp, or do the same at night before bed. I really would have thought by now that my kids would be tired of this video, but the way Rich has set the program up, it is still challenging for them. Rich continually tells the kids to have fun, and to do their very best, and to just do what they can. But he makes the program so darn fun that the kids really apply themselves, and do what they can to become better at the moves. Anyway, Rich does sets of 15 instead of the normal set of 5 or 10, this way, as he explains it, the kids can continue to advance within the program, because maybe they can only do 5 push ups or jumping jacks when they first start the program, but the goal is to reach 15, so they have to keep practicing at it. Another interesting thing Rich does is, he has the kids visualize they are grabbing apples & oranges instead of punching each other, or an imaginary opponet. At first I thought this was a little goofy, but once again as Rich explains it, it takes the violent aspect out of the technique, it makes it more fun for the kids, and if the kids pretend they are grabbing something they get a better stretch throughout the entire movement, both forward & back.
Did I say this video was Incredible?
I could list about 10 more things, but I think you get the picture. I'm telling you, BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS, it's amazing!
Hey Rich, if you read this, Your program is the greatest! Thank you from me & my kids!

1236719,5,B00000JQB4,"This is absolutely the most incredible program I've EVER seen. I generally don't write reviews, because most exercise programs I've seen don't deserve the time it takes to write one. So if I'm taking the time to write this one, let me tell you it is worth it. The words incredible, great, and excellent don't even come close to describing this program, I just couldn't think of any more powerful words to use.
The guy on this video, Rich Grogan, has really got something with this program. First of all he is fun, and entertaining for the kids. And the kids that are actually in the video are having fun (genuine fun, none of this paid actors fun), they're feeding off of Rich's positive energy, and having a good time with it. This is one of the major hooks that pulls you in, these kids are glowing with fun, energy, and excitement, and it is basically thrown into your living room when you watch the video. My kids at home can't just sit on the couch and watch this program, they have to get up and actually do the program. It is almost like some super-natural force grabs them and pulls them on the floor to begin exercising with Rich & the kids. I know this may sound strange, and I am sure some people are saying to themselves, ""there is NO way my kid would be this excited about an exercise program"". Well, I'm telling you it is true. And, it's not like my kids have only watched the program once or twice, we have basically wore out our VHS copy, and that is why we bought the DVD, which is even better, because now we can skip through to certain parts of the program when we are short on time. What I've been doing in the mornings, before summer camp, I'll get the kids up and pick a section of the video (DVD) and have them do that section before we leave for summer camp, or do the same at night before bed. I really would have thought by now that my kids would be tired of this video, but the way Rich has set the program up, it is still challenging for them. Rich continually tells the kids to have fun, and to do their very best, and to just do what they can. But he makes the program so darn fun that the kids really apply themselves, and do what they can to become better at the moves. Anyway, Rich does sets of 15 instead of the normal set of 5 or 10, this way, as he explains it, the kids can continue to advance within the program, because maybe they can only do 5 push ups or jumping jacks when they first start the program, but the goal is to reach 15, so they have to keep practicing at it. Another interesting thing Rich does is, he has the kids visualize they are grabbing apples & oranges instead of punching each other, or an imaginary opponet. At first I thought this was a little goofy, but once again as Rich explains it, it takes the violent aspect out of the technique, it makes it more fun for the kids, and if the kids pretend they are grabbing something they get a better stretch throughout the entire movement, both forward & back.

The information is priceless, and the movements the kids perform is very, very easy to remember, and very easy to perform.

Good Luck",1081641600,,861,4.288343558282208
1236722,1,B00000JQB4,"I have done countless other workout videos, and I have studied martial arts for years.  I bought this video hoping for a martial-arts-oriented hardcore aerobic workout with motivating music, but without the complicated dance moves or Barbie-doll instructor.  I'm not exactly sure what I got...
First of all, the quality of this video is TERRIBLE!  It appears to have been shot in Rich's basement.  He has about 6 people trying to do the workout in a 2-square-foot area.  I got claustrophobic just watching them.
There is no choreography whatsoever.  The entire video is just Rich counting out sets of 8 basic kicks over and over.  For this type of thing, I'd rather just do it on my own with my heavy bag, and listen to some decent music while doing it.
The music is what finally made me stop the tape before the end of the workout.  Apparently, the music was not playing while they were filming, but was dubbed in later.  He does not stay with the beat.  After doing choreographed aerobic workouts for so long, I simply couldn't handle this.  I tried to stay with Rich, but my body kept trying to stay with the music.  It was intolerable.  I suppose that with practice, you could learn to ignore the music, but why bother when there are so many other quality workout videos?",1080777600,5,1275,4.613333333333333
1236723,5,B00000JQB4,"This program is absolutely amazing. I have NEVER seen kids respond to a program, (especially an exercise program) the way kids respond to this one. I just put the tape (Now the DVD)in and the kids are lost in a world of exercise. I am sure this sounds crazy, especially how kids are today about exercising, but I swear it's the truth. I read several of the other reviews and I wasn't quite sure my kids would be as wrapped up in the video as others had stated. - I was wrong. My kids LOVE IT, we have played the tape over 25 times, and now we have the DVD (which is great), and I don't know how many times we are going to play it.
Take my word for it, this program is the most incredible program I've ever seen for kids.",1080259200,5,720,4.041958041958042

1236725,5,B00000JQB4,"I agree 100% with the other reviews. This video is pretty amazing, and just like the other reviews had stated, the kid's involvement is even more amazing. I popped this video in and the kids didn't move from the T.V. Now, I can't tell you that they did the entire program the first couple of times, but they still watched it. And, after about 3 times watching it they got through the entire program with only a few breaks. This is another awesome feature, because a lot of exercise videos, especially childrens leave no room for growth. Meaning, you have mastered the video the first time through, and after watching it a second or third time you are bored with it. This is especially true for children, who get bored of just about anything after a few times. But, like I mentioned this program is different, it is challenging enough to keep the kids trying, but not to tough where they lose interest. In my opinion it is a perfect balance, which in itself is pretty amazing.",1079222400,7,975,4.5141242937853105
1236726,5,B00000JQB4,"This is an incredible program, I take care of 6 kids, 4 of my own, and 2 neighborhood kids. Things are always crazy around the house, to say the least.
This program is what I use to get the kids ready for a nap. I pop the video in, and it is almost like magic, the kids gather around and begin exercising, like some super-natural power pulls them to the T.V. and makes their bodies begin exercising. After about 15 minutes half the kids are laying down for their nap, the other kids do their best to finish the program. They always want to get through to the end to watch the special karate kicks that Mr. Grogan does at the end. I'll have to tell you, I enjoy watching that section too, it is pretty awesome, but so is the entire program.",1079136000,3,739,4.174825174825175

I've got 4 kids of my own, and I babysit 2 neighborhood kids, so to say the least, things are a bit crazy around the house. I bought this video after a friend told me how much her kids loved it. The only thing she didn't tell me was that the kids would be totally mezmerized by it, and almost without even knowing it, they begin exercising with the video. It is amazing to see. I almost went into shock after putting it in for the first time, all 6 kids stood up and began doing the program. I didn't have to say a word, they just got up and started following. I just stood back and said WOW! Oh, another great feature is, after the kids finish exercising to the video, they are ALL ready for a nap. Some of the kids are ready for a nap about half way through.
I'm glad I listened to my friend and bought this video, you'll be glad to.",1079136000,,928,3.9946236559139785
1236818,5,B00000JQB4,"Boy am I glad this video is now available on DVD. I have almost wore out the VHS copy. Or should I say my 4 kids have. They love this video, I've never seen anything like it. Who would think that kids would actually enjoy exercising? I sure wouldn't have. I bought the VHS about six months ago, because my kids liked the cover and I told them they needed to start exercising instead of playing video games all the time. Well, I figured this video would get played once and then get lost in the huge stack of videos we already have. Well here it is six months later and it is still sitting out by the TV. That just blows my mind. Don't get me wrong, this video is really awesome, I just can't believe how hooked my kids are to it, it's amazing. Anyway, one of my kids saw that this video was now on DVD, so we had to buy the DVD. Lord knows how many times the DVD will get played. But, I got what I wanted out of the deal, the kids are exercising more, and playing video games less. I even think they are seriously getting in better shape. Simply amazing!",1078963200,10,1054,4.072115384615385
1236819,5,B00000JQB4,"WOW - is about the only words to describe this program. I am a physical education teacher for grades K-6, and I see approximately 1000 kids a week, and this is by far the best program I've ever seen for kids.
The kids, and I mean all the kids, absolutely love it. Once I turn it on they are drawn in like magnets to metal, it it amazing to see. I bet I've played this video 30 times, and each time I play it the kids get excited, they even ask if they can watch the ""kicking video"", or the ""apple grabbing"" video - that is what the kids call it. Oh, the apple grabbing, that is what Mr. Grogan has the kids imagine they are doing instead of punching another kid. This is a great concept, because like Mr. Grogan says, this way the kids are thinking of grabbing apples instead of punching ""Johnny"". I know it may sound silly, but it works, and more importantly - the kids love it!
I am very happy to see that this program is now available on DVD, because now I can select certain parts of the program to do at the beginning & ending of class. Like I mentioned, I have grades K - 6, so there is a big difference in age, but all the kids are taken in by this program. I have been a Physical education teacher for 25 years, and I often get accused of being ""Old Fashion"", and unwilling to accept new things & change. So to be honest, it was very hard for me to buy this video in the first place, just because it was something new, and most of the ""new"" things I've bought lately, especially exercise related has been junk that NO kid on earth could possibly do. Anyway, as you can see from my praise, this video is amazing, and now that it is on DVD is even better. DVD is also a new thing that I've had to adjust to, this is only the second DVD I've bought, and so far I'm very happy with it. I understand that Mr. Grogan has a few other videos, I think I'll check them out to.
From me and the 1000 kids I see weekly - Thank you Mr. Grogan, you did an incredible job with this program.",1077321600,19,1982,4.020253164556962

After reading the reviews, I decided to choose this video, - I'm glad I did. Others were right on with their description of this video, well, everyone except the braindead person who gave the video only 1 star, because it wasn't an exercise video. Hint, the title is Children's Safety & Self-Defense, but I do recommend Mr. Grogan's Children's exercise video, it is by far the best kid's exercise video I've ever seen. It may sound like I'm defending Mr. Grogan, I am. I met him at a convention last year, and I'll tell you, he is one incredible person who truly cares about kids. He has put all of energy & efforts into these videos, and it shows, they're incredible. But remember this is a safety video, his other kid's video is an exercise video. Just read the reviews, and you'll know which is which.",1076630400,3,973,4.565714285714286

But, with this program we both agree, it is awesome. Kids are a lot smarter than most people give them credit for being. They can usually tell when someone is a fake, or just trying to impress them. I tell you, Rich Grogan does an awesome job with the kids. The kids in the video, and my kids can see his geniune care & excitment toward them, and they feed off of it. It is absolutely amazing to watch. It is also very heart-warming to see these kids so excited about exercising. I believe that the kids are having so much fun, they actually forget they are exercising. I've even done the program several times with my kids, and I am no different than the kids, once I get started, I am drawn in, and before I know it 30 minutes has passed and we are at the end of the program.

The self defense aspect was good, however, the title is very misleading.  There is no way that this video would get anyone fit.  Also, the first several minutes was just talking, so the content only ends up lasting between 10 and 15 minutes.  I do not recommend purchasing this video.",1074470400,,399,4.72463768115942

I'm just happy they're getting some type of exercise, but this video is far more than just kids exercising, it's really fun. I say this because I have done the video several times with my kids - It's a good workout!
I'm serious, with colder weather coming up, your kids probably won't be outside much, and they'll give you the ""I'M BORED"" - then you should give them the Kick to get fit workout for kids.

Don't get me wrong, kids in general love to move & stay busy, but there is something about this video that really gets them moving and keeps them moving. Mr. Grogan does an excellent job setting up each new movement, and he really gives the kids a great workout. This workout will also challenge most adults, but it is done in such a controlled manner that you wouldn't realize it - until you do it. The kids that Mr. Grogan has selected to be in this video are truely having fun, they are feeding off Mr. Grogan's energy and it passes on to the viewer at home. My kids absolutely love this video, and I am sure yours will to. Oh, one thing I forgot to mention, Mr. Grogan has set levels within this video so children of all ages can do this video, and also benefit from it. He has kids that are very young in the front, to children in their early teens in the back, and what's amazing is; they are all exercising together, and ALL getting a great workout.

These videos are excellent, and they are just what society needs to start getting in better shape. Let me start by saying that Rich Grogan is an extremely nice guy, along with being very intelligent. I talked to him for 30 straight minutes, and he was as nice to me as if he'd known me his whole life, I respect that. I also respect what he is doing with these exercise videos. I'm telling you, this guy really cares about helping adults & children get in better shape, he's for real, which is very nice to see, considering most people in Rich's position are just paid, unintelligent, money hungry actors. Trust me, this guy is genuine!
About the videos, they are extremely well done, and most importantly they are easy to follow, and very effective - MEANING - THEY WORK!
WOW, my advice - spend a few bucks and buy the whole set, you'll be very glad you did.

Then Rich came on the screen and showed very easy to follow self-defense movements. I want to tell you, even though these movements are easy to follow, THEY ARE EFFECTIVE & THEY WORK!

Rich clearly has worked with kids, and it shows very clearly in this video. He interacts with the kids throughout the entire program, he makes jokes and laughs, and just makes this program a pleasure to watch.

My kids truly love this video, Rich does a great job of motivating the kids, he is humerous, funny, and enthusiastic, they just love it. Of course this is great for me, because I haven't found a kid's exercise program yet that the kids enjoy. Atleast not until Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids.

It was also very detailed in it's explainations of self-defense movements, but what I liked the best was how simple Rich Grogan made the self-defense movements.

1237037,5,B00000JQB4,"I bought all of the Kick to Get Fit videos at an exercise convention, and I am just thrilled to write a review about them.
All the videos are great, but the kid's exercise video is by far the best thing I HAVE EVER SEEN FOR KIDS! Rich Grogan is a natural, he knows how to present the movements, and better yet he knows how to relate to kids. He has taken Martial Arts & Fitness movements and broken them down for kids. It is AMAZING the things he has done within this video. And the graphics and special effects are pretty amazing to.
This is video is a must, trust me, once you see it you'll know what I am talking about.",1041120000,4,622,4.065040650406504

I was excited to get this video since it had a five star rating, but very disappointed when I watched it. I couldn't believe the poor home video quality for the money. The instructor couldn't stick with the 32 count phasing, if he knows what that is. The music was horrible. I turned the volume off because I couldn't stand him and eventually turned off the video. I don't recommend spending the money on this video.",1039651200,4,504,4.611111111111111
1237039,5,B00000JQB4,"I am glad I found this video in time for the new year. I really believe that I am going to reach my fitness goals with this video. Mr. Grogan does an excellent job of explaining the proper way to do the movements, along with showing a variety of exciting combinations. This video is different than most videos I have done in the past. First of all, I can actually do this video, because the pace is very controlled, Mr. Grogan explains that that is the only way to get the most out of a workout. He is right! I always thought you had to go at a very fast pace in order to get an aerobic workout, but by doing the movements at a controlled pace you are able to work more muscle fibers during the movement, which will provide you with a better workout, not to mention a much safer one. This is the first time I have heard these concepts, but they are 100% right on the money, and the proof I have is very visible. I have already lost 8 pounds in 2 weeks and my energy level is through the roof. I am looking foward to an exciting and much healthier new year.
Thank you Mr. Grogan

1237040,5,B00000JQB4,"I have read the reviews from others about the Kick to get fit video, and I agree with most of them. This was a very fun and a very effective workout. I REALLY enjoyed Grogan's personality, he made the workout a lot of fun, and he also explained how to do things in an advanced way to get alittle better workout, if you're at that level. Like Grogan said thoughout the workout, ""Go at your own pace, this workout is for you!"" He not only says these things, but he also shows you different ways to accomplish this.
I REALLY enjoyed this tape and I personally don't see how anyone who gives this video a try could have anything to complain about. Unless they have no clue about exercise videos, and just need something to complain about.
This isn't Tae-Bo or any of those other videos that I have tried in the past, this video is different, this is a video I can do and see results from.
Thank you Mr. Grogan, I really enjoy your video!",1006819200,,933,4.27683615819209
1237041,1,B00000JQB4,"This has to be the worst tape I've purchased and I have at least 300 videos in my library.  I would consider myself a cardio boxing enthusiast.  I have been doing Taebo for 3 years and LOVE it.  I wanted to expand my library since I have every Taebo Advanced tape available.  I received Rich Grogan's tape and tried it over the weekend.  Not only does he have no rhythm, his crew is out of synch, the music is not in tempo with the moves and the quality of the tape is horrible.  Everyone is moving at different times because the beat of the music doesn't match the workout moves.  Grogan is a mess in this tape.  Either he can't keep up with his crew or the crew can't keep up with him.  It looks like he filmed it himself with a camcorder.  Save your money.  I found it hard to keep my heart rate up at a steady rate.  (...)",1005523200,,826,4.062111801242236
1237042,5,B00000JQB4,"I found the Kick to get fit video to be very interesting. Mr. Grogan has slowed down the movements so the viewer is able to keep up with the pace. He explains that by going at a slower pace you are able to do the movements through a full range of motion. He states this will work the muscles in a much better and more effective way than doing the movements fast. This is a new concept to me, I have done aerobic videos for a long time and most of them go at a break neck pace, which is often very difficult to keep up with. I found that doing the Kick to get fit video at the pace suggested and presented by Mr. Grogan and his helpers, worked areas, and muscle groups I didn't know I had. I found this to be very effective. This also makes a great deal of sense, the more muscle groups worked during a workout, the more effective the workout. I really enjoyed the new concept, it really makes this video fun and very effective. I am really looking forward to Mr. Grogan's next video.",989798400,,983,4.125
1237043,5,B00000JQB4,"I really enjoyed the kick to get fit workout. I found the video to be very enjoyable and very easy to follow along with. The instructor, Rich Grogan, shows you different levels for doing the movements, this has been very helpful, and is one of the reasons why I find this video fun to do. Another reason is the movements are very controlled and are done at a lot slower pace than most videos I've seen. I have found that by doing the movements slower and more controlled, my muscles seem to burn more. It makes me wonder why other videos go so fast! If you're looking for a really fun workout that is easy to do, I recommend kick to get fit.",987552000,,641,4.219512195121951
1237111,2,B00000JQB4,"I bought this video based on the rave reviews it has received. I have the Kathy Smith and Billy Blanks kickboxing videos, and was looking to vary the routine. The first part of the video seemed great, with easy to follow demonstrations, and a killer buns/thighs floor workout. However, the rest of the video was disappointing. After all the talk about ""go at your own pace,"" I thought the floor exercises went much too fast. During the standing portion of the workout, Grogran loses count on every section, and the music beats don't match the workout counts. This may not be a big deal for some, but I found it very distracting. I am used to instructors that are conscientious about working both sides of the body evenly. As to the ""fun"" factor: Grogan kept telling me to have fun, but I didn't, not even after the fiftieth time he told me to! I can only recommend the buns/thigh drill portion of video at the beginning if you take it at a slower pace.",985392000,3,952,4.477011494252873
1237112,5,B00000JQB4,"I really enjoyed this workout. I workout at a healthclub about 3 days a week, I also do aerobic videos at home. I have done just about every exercise video made, so I have seen my share of different styles. Some of the videos are by popular TV stars and others are by unknow people. Well, I have never heard of Rich Grogan before I bought his Kick to get fit video, but I am sure it won't be long before his name is very popular. That is if he continues to make videos like Kick to get fit, which I hope he does. This video was a great workout, and the pace was so easy to follow. Rich explained the movements in the beginning of the video in great detail. This really helped me understand how to properly do each movement, and I have found that by doing the movements in the correct form, I get a lot better of a workout. I have always done aerobic classes and videos at a very fast pace, because I thought that was the only way to get a good workout. But after doing this video I realize that doing the movements at a controlled pace allowed more muscle groups to work together. So by working more muscle groups at one time I am getting more out of my workout in less time, not to mention safier movements for the joints. I am hooked on Kick to get fit, I can't wait for his next video. Thank you Rich Grogan, I really like your personality, attitude, and of course your video.",984528000,,1379,4.130111524163569
1237113,4,B00000JQB4,"Kick to get fit is an informal style workout video. If you are discouraged by fancy steps and a workout video where everyone in the video is in perfect sinc and never messes up, then this video is for you. The counts are off and even the instructor gets lost once or twice but no ones perfect is Grogen's approach. You will definately feel the hip flexor workout the next day, but it is at a fast tempo so be prepared to really work for it. The toughest part is over in the beginning of the workout leaving the rest easy to breeze through. I like to pop in the VCR every now and again to feel the burn.",984528000,,602,4.067226890756302

1237115,5,B00000JQB4,"I just wanted to say what a great workout this was, and the instructional section was excellent. I not only learned how to do each movement correctly, but I also learned what muscle groups were being worked. And better than that I only had to buy one tape for much less instead of 4 different tapes for $80.00. This is a great workout and a great deal.",972432000,,352,4.268656716417911
1237116,5,B00000JQB4,"I skimmed through the video before actually doing it. And boy, was I surprised after working out! Just watching (in occasional fast forward  mode) gave me the impression that this would be only somewhat challlenging.  I was wrong! The moves are so controlled, that I was able to do the entire  workout. Therefore, I really felt the burn. Rich does a nice variety of of  moves, so that there aren't that many repetitions. Most combinations are  'just' 2 sets of 8. So, I felt the burn, but was able to go on to the next  move. This variety helps you stay focused and not quit. I was especially  impressed with with cool down and massage. I often skip the cool down, but  this one really made me feel terrific afterwords. Surprisingly, I feel like  I got a better workout here than with many longer step videos (not just  toning, but aerobically too).
This isn't the most polished video. The  people aren't perfect in their looks or performance. But frankly, that adds  to the appeal. You feel more a part of the 'class' than with other videos.  And again the moves, while not overly complicated, do keep you focused more  on completing the workout than on how tired you may feel.",966556800,3,1178,4.5476190476190474

The reviews and Doctor endorsements were right on, Rich Grogan really  knows how to adjust the pace of the workout and set the levels for  everyone, he really makes you feel like you can do it, and he shows you  that you don't have to go fast. He continues to remind you thoughout the  video that this workout is for you, and to go at your own pace, he also  shows you different paces to go at. This is what I have been wanting in an  exercise video, someone to set different levels for me to follow along  with. I am feeling much more confident about myself, I have more energy and  I feel like I am tougher.

Rich Grogan slows the pace down so that you work the  muscles in their full range of motion. This is the first time I have heard  this, most of the other video tapes I buy all perform the movements in a  very fast and quick motion, which is hard for me to keep up with. Rich  shows you in the video how doing the movements in a steady and controlled  way works the whole muscle, not just part of the muscle. He also shows you  how to do the movements so that you use as many muscles as possible for  each movement. So you are doing twice the work in less time.  By the way  the hips and buns get worked to death, these are the two areas of my body  that I have the hardest time with, but Kick to Get Fit does the job.
