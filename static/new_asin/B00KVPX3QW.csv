8661962,5,B00KVPX3QW,I have been a huge fan of Horizontal Conditioning for a couple of years now. I consistently did the club workouts (she sends a live class dvd out once per month) for about 8 months or so without doing any weight workouts and got an amazing physique. My abs and shoulders had the most amazing and killer definition ever (I had an 8 pack...not kidding). I stopped for about a year but still maintained the results in my abs while doing other workouts. I have come back to HC with this DVD and I found my love again. This is bodyweight only (all you need is a mat) but so tough. Plank and pushup variations with leg work intermixed in. Very challenging!,1402358400,4,650,4.336065573770492
