2659252,5,B000IOM9VQ,"The creators of Hot Fuzz managed to pull off a brilliant parody of the action cop/buddy movie coupled with the murder in the perfect English village genre, while at the same time creating one of the best action cop/buddy movies set in a perfect English village. This takes understanding of the genres, respect for the themes, and actors that can pull off the roles without smirking at the camera.

This movie requires that you pay attention as clues are dropped right and left (just like in the English Village Murder genre). There is also the perfect build up for the mismatched police partners (think Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys II, Point Blank etc) so that even though you know how the pair will end up behaving you enjoy watching it happen.

When the movie takes its last turn into a full blown action flick, you will be ready for the laughter.

There is some blood and gore as mentioned by another reviewer, but far less  than in the current slasher films. There is plenty of warning so you have time to choose not to watch those scenes. And even the deaths are a parody of slasher films.",1177459200,4,1089,4.540816326530612
2659253,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Having never seen 2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B000B2YR8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>, I didn't know what to expect from director/co-screenwriter Edgar Wright's latest movie, which plays out like an Ealing Studios only-in-Britain comedy amplified on Tarantino-level steroids. The 2007 action farce achieves the impressive feat of being silly and smart, quite often at the same time, as Wright and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pegg show themselves to be cineastes with a sharp eye and nimble ear for satire. There are lots of derivative plot turns to track in this fish-out-of-water story, which shifts into a blazing, gun-toting thriller as a tribute to testosterone-driven, Jerry Bruckheimer-genre buddy movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Point-Break/dp/B00005A3KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Point Break</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Boys-II/dp/B0002J4X34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Boys II</a>. Even the intentionally exploitative title fits the tone of this eminently enjoyable popcorn flick perfectly.

With laser-sharp precision, Pegg stars as a straight-arrow aptly named Nicholas Angel, inarguably the best police officer in London. However, he is so good that he makes the rest of the force look ineffectual, which leads to his unceremonious transfer to a sleepy hamlet named Sandford. There he carries his duties quite seriously, which naturally puts him at odds with the casual townsfolk. But then a suspicious car accident occurs, and the plot escalates into a wild ride of contrived but often hilarious developments leading to an ambitious, cartoon-like series of exciting finales. Angel naturally needs a partner to succeed, and Nick Frost (looking a lot like Mark Addy from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Full-Monty/dp/6305622914/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Full Monty</a>) winningly plays schlubby Danny, a wannabe action hero who happens to be the devoted son of Frank Butterman, the village police chief. Together they uncover a plot that upends the entire community.

There are lots of familiar faces in funny supporting turns - Timothy Dalton at his smarmy best (and looking well poised to inherit Christopher Plummer's villain roles) as the suspicious supermarket owner; Jim Broadbent as the seemingly benevolent Frank; Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as a couple of sarcastic, mustachioed detectives; and in bit parts, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan as a couple of London's befuddled finest and an uncredited Cate Blanchett as Angel's put-upon girlfriend Jeanine conveniently hidden by a forensic mask. The one-liners are funny enough, but what really resonate are the subtle, often throwaway shots that make fun of American movie conventions. Even though the film runs for over two hours, Wright and Pegg have paced the story with a dexterous mix of thrills, intelligence and laughs. Much of this successful hat trick is due to Chris Dickens' propulsive editing and a nifty combination of over-the-top stunts and visual effects. This film is quite an unexpected kick.",1177286400,5,3245,6.4574712643678165
2659254,5,B000IOM9VQ,"If you loved Shawn of the Dead, I have no doubt that you will love this film as well. It was a fascinating film, a little creepy, and more than hilarious. It was total fun!

Beware that like Shawn of the Dead there was a lot of violence involved and one kindof graphic decapitation scene, no worse than a Highlander film in that respect and like Highlander totally fun. This film is not exactly child friendly but if the child is old enough take them and make it a family event. They will have fun. I know I did.",1177286400,3,512,4.171717171717172
2659255,5,B000IOM9VQ,"If you are interested in your tradition crime solving edge of your seat police movie, have we got a treat for you! 'Hot Fuzz' is the newest release from the comedy team that brought you 'Shawn of the Dead' one of the most origional plays on the cliche horror movie. This time the world of action packed crime fighting cops is placed in the hand of these comic geniuses. There are so many things in this movie that made it probably one of the most entertaining movies I have seen since '300'. One I just love British movies. Two all the hysterical dialogue even during the most tense moments in the movie that just make you snicker even though you know you shouldn't be. Three, the final chapter in the movie that takes almost every cliche moment from your tradition action movie and twists them in so many ways you will wet your pants from laughing so hard. If you haven't been to the movies in a while this will be your final excuse to go before Spider-Man 3 and the other much awaited Summer blockbusters move into theaters",1177286400,,1025,4.428571428571429
2659256,4,B000IOM9VQ,"While I really enjoyed Hot Fuzz, it falls well short of Shaun of the Dead. To me, the humor in Hot Fuzz wasn't as funny as the previous film, but the action sure made up for it. This movie also boasts ample gore and a couple of inventive death sequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are funny guys and I hope to see them team up many more times in the future.",1177200000,3,357,3.9722222222222223
2659257,5,B000IOM9VQ,I agree with the reviewer before me. This movie is the best I have seen in the last few years. I would recomend it to any one who likes to laugh or likes a good action flick,1177200000,3,173,3.7027027027027026
2659258,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a top cop in London's precinct, but because he's responsible for solving all the crimes, his colleagues have been made to all look bad. Forced to move to the Sanford precinct, Nick must also work with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the overeager constable and son of revered police chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is a hardcore action nut, and enjoys films such as ""Bad Boys II"" and ""Point Break"", so he believes Nick to be the real deal. Meanwhile, a series of bizarre accidents that lead to people's demises occur, but no one except believes Nick when he believes these accidents to be the work of some darker force, except for Danny, who could believe that this could be the chance to live out fantasy. So the two must work together and find out who the person behind the Grim Reaper cloak is.

Who could forget ""Shaun of the Dead""? This wacky zombie film pretty much was an homage to horror comedies (""Dead Alive"" - I bring it up because director Peter Jackson among others praised the film) and George A. Romero-directed zombie films. It put director Edgar Wright at the top of the heap, and Simon Pegg became a hot commodity (he had a brief, but major role in ""Mission Impossible III"", and appeared in the Grindhouse faux trailer Don't, directed by Wright). Well, Wright, Pegg, Pegg's co-star Nick Frost, and a host of famous British actors rally up for ""Hot Fuzz"". And I'm pleased to report that it's a blast.

With ""Fuzz"", Wright sinks his claws into the action film genre, but uses films of Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver lore as pie crust. That's right, ""Bad Boys II"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" are among the many films of ""honorable"" mention. From uttering infamous quotes (""**** just got real"") to filming a fist fight during a rainstorm (that happened during the final battle between Mel Gibson and Gary Busey's individual characters in the Richard Donner classic), Wright lampoons these scenes and makes sure they gel with the story effectively enough. Of course, there's other films that aren't safe: John Woo (gunslingers holding two guns), Clint Eastwood (Nick rides into town on a horse), and Tony Scott (flashbacks and suspects getting labeled have the sheen of a Nine Inch Nail video, just like in ""Domino"").

The film also moves at a frenetic speed, yet there's plenty of time for characterization (wait until you hear what Nick Angel wanted to be before he chose the way of the shield). Of course, Wright doesn't pack on too much emotional weight on, since this is a spoof after all, but we enjoy the entertaining chemistry between Simon Pegg's straight-man sergeant and Nick Frost's oafish constable sidekick. And, like in ""Bad Boys II"", they have to put up with two jerk officers (""In America""'s Paddy Considine, Shaun of the Dead's Rafe Spall) who often make fun of them. Of course, unlike Jose Pablo Cantillo's meany cop from ""Disturbia"", the Andys are always a welcome presence, and play off well against our heroes.

Even the supporting characters get plenty of well-written parts. ""Shaun of the Dead"" vet Bill Nighy makes the most of his limited screen time as Nick's original boss, Jim Broadbent matches Nick Frost's character's oafish constable as the Sanford chief, Paul Freeman (who played Ivan Ooze in the first ""Power Rangers"" film) is deadpan best as a priest who is part of a lampoon of Robert Rodriguez's ""Desperado"" (he brandishes his guns from his shirt sleeves), ""The Wicker Man""'s Edward Woodward has fun as the member of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance (I'll let you ponder on the abbreviation), and Timothy Dalton... I will be happy to say that one of the best actors to play James Bond (right up there with Daniel Craig) gives a bravura comedic performance as the smarmy supermarket owner (think of Cantillo's ""Disturbia"" performance, only intentionally funny and never overstaying its welcome).

Wright doesn't stop there. With 30 minutes left to go, the director films one of the longest, and most suspenseful, action scenes of the year. With Nick armed with almost every weapon from the storage, aforementioned side players pushed into the fray, plot twists about some of the Sanford citizens (which will rock your socks off), and David Arnold's adrenaline-charged compositions backing it up, ""Fuzz"" delivers high-speed action and laughs when our heroes fight the bad guys. I doubt anyone will sleep through it.

""Hot Fuzz"" is irrepressible fun, and in a time when the only action comedies available are crap (""Code Name: The Cleaner""), it hardly pulls any punches. Even during the ending, which could've been melancholy, gets sucker punched with a scorching-hot one-liner (""Bring the Noise"") and an enjoyable punk rock tune to cap it all off. For me, this is heaven. And I will await the days for Edgar Wright's next beast. Maybe we'll get some Americans in the cast?",1177113600,,4855,4.893074119076549
2659259,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Work hard, but not too hard.  If you show your co-workers up, you could end up eliminated--either transferred or fired.  That's what PC Nicholas Angel found out.  When he got 9 Commendations in one year, the London officials promoted him and sent him to a model village, Sandford, where there hadn't been a murder in years.

Angel quickly discovered Sandford was too good to be true.  His predecessor probably found out the same thing--but he went loony.  Angel, with the help of his cop-movie loving partner, Danny, decides to clean up the town instead.

I laughed so hard at points my sides hurt, but there were also a couple of places where I felt a little ill.  ""Hot Fuzz"" poked fun at just about every US police film notion. The puns flew and sometimes so did the blood and gore.

What _wasn't_ funny was how possible murder could be passed off as an accident in a small town.  It's been 4 hours and I'm still shaking.",1177027200,6,923,4.506024096385542

2659282,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Supercop Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is exiled from London to a seemingly idyllic country village, where he uncovers the secrets behind a series of murders that everyone else believes to be accidents.

Writer/director Edgar Wright and his accomplice Pegg have turned out an absolutely hilarious love letter to the action movies of the 80s and 90s with a nod to slasher flicks as well.  Applying the conventions of the genre to the complacent English countryside is inherently funny, but this film also benefits from sharp writing, a dynamite cast (including frequent Pegg co-star Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, and a whos who of British character actors) and intelligent direction that moves the camera and stages the action is ways that really help some of the jokes land hard.

2659284,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright get together to continue the work they started with 2004's Shaun of the Dead, this time dropping a parody of cheesy police action flicks. Like its predecessor, it works on a satirical level, but also as a standalone - albeit one with far less heart than we saw in Shaun. Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a straight-laced London constable who's so fanatical about his job, the top brass worry they'll look bad by comparison and ship him off to the minor leagues. There he partners with Frost, a slobbish underachiever, and swiftly uncovers a vast criminal conspiracy. Fuzz relies heavily on one-liners and sight gags, which are generally pretty effective, but lacks a real emotional hook. That makes for an entertaining two hours, if not for endless re-screenings. The best work comes from the supporting cast, with Timothy Dalton leading the pack as the town's squinting, scheming, mustachioed mastermind grocer. And, of course, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall are downright show-stealing as the two Andys, resident detectives more concerned with needling newbies than cracking cases. I could've done with a lot more of those guys. A good film, with some big laughs, but no more than that.

2659343,3,B000IOM9VQ,"The comedic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are changing the way people view British comedy. For decades, the Brits have been far behind us, featuring the dry, the peculiar, the tedious, and worst of all, Monty Python. Ten years ago, I wouldn't see a British comedy if you paid me, but now, all I need is to see this duo involved and I'm there! Hot Fuzz was the duos follow up to the wildly successful Shaun of The Dead, and while it doesn't compare to that film, it is still a really funny movie. The film features Simon Pegg as London's toughest cop, who is unwillingly transferred to a small town in the country. Paired with an idiot, he's about to die of boredom, and starts looking into the towns history of mysterious accidents, only to discover a pattern. Once Pegg has the scent, he's on the trail of a long running town secret, one that is ridiculous yet hilarious. Unlike Shaun of The Dead, the story here isn't as cut and dry. It requires some background and does take quite a while to get going. Unlike any of their other films, previously or since, the duo decided to pack all the fun into the last half hour of the film. Hot Fuzz certainly has it's moments, but it's the last half hour that makes it a classic. Simon Pegg plays the serious one for a change, leaving much of the laughs up to Nick Frost who certainly doesn't disappoint. Personally, I prefer Pegg over Frost and would have liked to see his character loosen up a little bit, but it doesn't really take anything away from the story. The first half hour of this film, you're going to think I'm crazy, but by the last half hour, you'll be thanking me for recommending you see this film. It is a must for fans of buddy comedies and it just might force you to watch Shaun of The Dead again.",1452470400,,1764,4.316265060240964

2659345,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is possibly the funniest and most clever movie I have ever seen. Without spoiling anything major, here's what you need to know:
Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is an exceptional cop. In fact, he is so exceptional, that he is reassigned to Sanford, a small, sleepy town with practically no crime, due to the fact that he's been making his fellow officer's look bad. Upon arriving in Sanford, a string of murders begins, all of them masqueraded as accidents. Angel, along with fellow officer Danny (Frost), must find out who's behind these murders.
As per usual, the chemistry between Pegg and Frost is great. Danny, who has an infatuation with action movies, offers a plethora of laughs. Pegg plays a great straight-man, allowing him to break his likable slacker mold (as in Shaun of the Dead) and play a deadly serious cop who is the best at what he does
One of the most impressing things about Hot Fuzz is the attention to detail. Almost every joke, whether delivered via dialogue or through visuals, will come back into play later in the movie. Additionally, there is a lot of subtle foreshadowing that will most likely slip by upon initial viewing.
Now to talk about what is possibly the best part of the whole movie: The Villain. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), is in my humble opinion, one of the greatest villains in cinema history. Skinner is so hilariously over the top that is becomes blatantly obvious that Dalton is having loads of fun with the role.
In conclusion, Hot Fuzz is nothing short of cinematic brilliance. The visual & dialogue-delivered jokes always work, and often double as subtle foreshadowing. I notice a new, subtle detail almost every time I watch it. Pegg and Frost have great chemistry, and play off of each other very well. Dalton has the time of his life playing Simon Skinner, a pitch-perfect villain. It is easily the best of the Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy, as well as Edgar Wright's best movie, which is saying something, considering he's made nothing but great movies. This movie is, as Danny would say, ""Off the f**king chain!""",1451520000,,2068,4.795518207282913

2659361,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I've become a big Simon Pegg fan since Shaun Of The Dead came out in 2004. Hot Fuzz is part two of the 'Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy', with Shaun O.T.D. being part one and The World's End is part three.
Hot Fuzz is my favorite of the three, a cop buddy film with tons of references to other action movies.

In this film Simon plays overachieving English Metro police officer Nick Angel who gets transferred to the sleepy village Sandford, Gloucestershire.
Here Nick Angel joins the local Police dept. and works with Frank Butterman(Nick Frost), a very laid-back small town cop obsessed with snacks and action movies.

A series of grisly 'accidents' cause the premature demise of some of Sandford's residents. Nick and Frank uncover a conspiracy involving a perfectly cast Timothy Dalton as arrogant supermarket manager Simon Skinner.

Hot Fuzz is a blast of fun and action with with some great gore effects and features cameos by: Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Cate Blanchett and Peter Jackson!",1444262400,,997,4.958083832335329

In addition, the plot or the story was about a policeman called Nicholas Angle, a high-achieving member of the Metro Politian Police Service, he was transferred from London to the village of Stanford, for being better than his colleagues, which made them look bad in comparison. It is so entertaining because it kept showing us how did he cooperated with his partner to solve the crimes that have been called accidents. It is one of my favorites moves and I recommend all of you no matter what is his or here age is to watch it. Moreover the movie showed how did Nicholas felt that something masteries happening around him in this village. Also there were so amazing scenes where Nicholas and his partner clashed with everyone to find how is around these crimes. And I also never forget when Nicholas gave up and went back to London because no one believed him, the music made me feel sad. But in some point he stop in the petrol station to fill his car with gas and when he entered the store he some thing inside him tolled him you should go back and figure out the masteries.

2659390,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz to the unknown is film that unleashes the devils. A British take off of the American shoot'em up cop films. The British version, however is much funnier with more belly laughs. I was not sure that what I had walked into and wondered if this was serious until the irony hit me.

Almost any British star you may think of appears in this film, and it is indeed fun to pick them out. I knew of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and this film brought their hilarity to the fore. Pegg plays Sargeant Angel from London who is such an exceptional cop that he puts everyone else to shame. He has a 400% arrest record, and the powers that be noticed he must be released. Off he is sent to the small town of Sandford.
What a grave disappointment to Angel. He finds the police force is shoddy and slow and their work ethic is below par. If takes awhile but he comes to realize that this town may have something.

The Neighbirhood Watch Association rubs the town, decides what is a crime, who should be dealt with, who will be released, and decides weapon to use. Angel slowly understands the climate, and he waits and listens, and plans. This is a very funny film, once you catch on. And the title of the film,should give you a leg up.

This is a great film for a lazy afternoon.

But does this type of this village really exist anymore? In a country the size of Oregon which is being flooded by hordes of African, Pakistani and Indian invaders, does this type of nice, clean, isolated_English_village really exist anymore? More likely, these places are populated by a shrinking, degenerate White native population of broken families, addicted to drink, drugs and debauchery, who are completely outnumbered by angry, Third World invaders stacked high in ""council estates"", who are also into drugs and drink with the added pastime of ""grooming"" the most vulnerable of the White girls as sex slaves.

As an American who's lived in both London and the Cotswolds (and, by birth, loves cheesy cop movies), this is spot on for all three places. I watched 22 Jump Street while living in a tiny 'perfect' village in Gloucester with a garden club and neighborhood association, and I'm pretty sure this is what was happening behind the scenes in our village. Man, I heard the most vile, bitter gossip from the sweet little old ladies at the tea houses. Take it one step further, and you've got this movie. Watch it with that in mind. :)",1426291200,,582,4.398148148148148

2659498,5,B000IOM9VQ,"In this second theatrical collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright, they take on the buddy cop movie and deliver another slick, funny parody. Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel, a good cop who is too good, in fact. So good that he is sent to the sleepy village of Sandford, because he was making his fellow Met cops look bad by comparison. While there, he stumbles on a conspiracy and sets out to stop it by any means necessary. One thing this movie definitely had going in its favor was that I enjoy action movies a lot more than horror movies. That's not to say I disliked SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but I like the action genre more. Like its predecessor, HOT FUZZ deals with genre cliches in a fun way while never exclusively relying on them to mine laughs. There was also a lot of references to other action movies that I thought were hilarious. And speaking of humor, I felt that this film was a significant improvement in terms of comedic writing from SHAUN OF THE DEAD. There was the more subtle British humor, which I am warming up to, and the more up-front genre-derived humor. Both work extremely well, and all of the actors deliver it perfectly. The only quibble I have with this film, though, is that it's about 10-15 minutes too long. This is mostly due to the ending, which feels like it could have ended at a couple spots, but then kept on going. What was there was funny enough, but in my opinion it could have been shortened a bit. Overall, HOT FUZZ is an improvement over SHAUN OF THE DEAD and delivers a hilarious action movie parody that genre fans will enjoy.",1407974400,,1587,4.438356164383562

There are several spoofs of scenes from other movies buried in the plot, mostly in the last 1/3 of the movie. It almost becomes a game to identify the source materiel.

2659526,5,B000IOM9VQ,The movie on blu-ray has never looked better. Also it is a very entertaining movie. Of the trilogy this one is my least favorite and I still consider it a great movie. If you are interested also look up Shaun of the Dead and The World's End.,1402963200,,241,4.148936170212766

2659549,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz comes of the coattails of Shaun of the Dead, which was a surprise hit. Many people loved Hot Fuzz as well, but more like Shaun of the Dead. In my opinion, Hot Fuzz trumps Shaun of the Dead in every way. The film reunites Simon Pegg and Nick Frost with director Edger Wright, and also stars Jim Broadbent and Timothy Dalton, both of whom are great in this movie. The best part about the entire film is how you cannot see the ending coming; I won't spoil it, but it's a lot stupider (and clever-er) then you might expect. The tone of the film is also perfect. All around, Hot Fuzz is a perfect comedy, definitely the funniest movie that has been released since 2000.
The 3-Disc Collector's Edition is packed full of extras. For those who own the single disc release, this set is worth upgrading. Included are a slew of commentaries, outtakes, a trivia track and featurettes that include Pegg and Frost parodying Sean Connery and Michael Caine and a short showing a humorous re-dub of the film's language for television. And that's just the first disc. On disc 2, we get a ton of featurettes showing how the film was made. Along with this we get ""Dead Right"", a 1993 amateur film directed by Wright that was used as a basis for Hot Fuzz. One can definitely see the influence and the feel the films share. Disc 3 has the Fuzzball Rally, a 40-minute video made by Pegg, Frost and Wright detailing their U.S. tour for the film. With this is a slew of iTunes vlogs made when the film was released. If there is one problem I have with this DVD set is that the Fuzzball rally was also included on the original single-disc DVD. Here, they take it off of disc 1 and put it on disc 3 to pad out the set. Regardless, this set is still awesome. The DVDs are housed in a neat box set that folds out like a police notepad with pictures.
All in all, Hot Fuzz is a great movie, definitely one of the best comedies released in the last ten years. The 3-Disc Collector's set is worth picking up for those who own the original release. This is an essential for any film library.",1399507200,2,2066,4.327319587628866

It was so funny we watched it again later in the flight and then watched it again several days later in our hotel room. The movie has lots of twists and turns...keeps you guessing until the very end.

2659597,3,B000IOM9VQ,"Three stars.  It's okay.  It's funny, it's worth watching, it's not ground-breaking and not really good.  Technically it's got better value than the modern super hero cartoons like Avengers, but those shows also have better action and effects and aren't really bad either--aside from being Save The Cat films that all drone to the same exact emotional formula.

This movie isn't a bottom-of-the-barrel bad film, a rejected B movie, or a cult film.  It stands on its own, it's entertaining, and it has a decent plot if a fairly ridiculous one.  It's also hilarious in many places, even the bad ones.  Not to mention it's lead in with a frickin' James Bond villain!",1393718400,,663,4.814159292035399

Simon Pegg is a hardcore cop from the city, transferred to a small, bucolic town.  No stranger to death and danger, this cop won't let any slimy thugs get the upper hand.  However, he (again) gets partnered with Nick Frost- naive and happy-go-lucky son of the town's inspector.  Hijinks ensue!  Highly recommended.",1391472000,,458,4.794871794871795

Its about an EXTREME by the book cop, perfect in just about everything copwise, but is lacking in personal interaction, which he slowly learns when he is transferred to a quiet village cause he was making other cops look bad. Slowly he discovers that ""accidents"" are really murders and he and his bumbly friend try to discover who is responsible and why",1390435200,,524,4.46875

2659643,5,B000IOM9VQ,I think Sgt;Nick Angel must be a relative. I had some of the same criticisms of my work as a Police Office/Corporal/Sergeant over the years that his Chief makes in his meetings at the beginning of the movie before his transfer to the UK equivalent of BFE. The case unfolds so well from his arrival up to the greatest supermarket assault in movie history.,1386806400,,354,4.546875
2659644,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Probably my favorite Pegg/Frost flick. I've seen Shawn of the Dead, Paul, and this and of the three, I definitely prefer Hot Fuzz. The premise is the most humorous of the three, and it's less preachy than Paul so that's always a plus.

All in all, you simply can't go wrong with Hot Fuzz. It's got action, comedy, and a very, very creepy group of old people.

True to life, I say.",1386633600,,380,4.263888888888889
2659645,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hilarious - the set up makes you feel a bit peculiar about the plot and what is going to happen but it's a slow roll over the top of a hill and then you are barrelling down it full speed, holding your sides you're laughing so hard.",1386633600,,231,3.9361702127659575
2659646,3,B000IOM9VQ,"While the acting was good, this movie simply isn't on the same level as Shaun of the Dead. Great as a rental option in my opinion.",1386547200,,130,4.038461538461538
2659647,5,B000IOM9VQ,One of my favorite movies of all time.  I love this movie.  It is pure action and pure comedy at once!  You can't go wrong with this classic.,1386547200,,141,3.9642857142857144
2659648,5,B000IOM9VQ,I love this movie and I got it after my friend introduced it to me.  It is funny and out there but hilarious!,1386028800,,109,3.739130434782609
2659656,1,B000IOM9VQ,The movie stopped playing halfway through.  I thought it just needed to reload but after 20 minutes it still didn't connect so I shut it off,1385942400,,140,4.384615384615385
2659657,1,B000IOM9VQ,"Bah,  the series gets better after the first movie.  Not that the some scene aren't rememberable, but the story as a whole is not to my taste.  An English freind tells me that the movie really nails the typical small English town or village(?).",1385424000,,244,4.5
2659658,2,B000IOM9VQ,It definitely wasn't worth the extra money to get it in hd. It was still funny though. I would recommend getting the standard version.,1385424000,,134,4.625

2659661,5,B000IOM9VQ,"These guys are hilarious! Even when Simon Pegg is serious, he's funny. I could watch this over and over and, in fact, I have. The ending is just fabulous! If you like, Shawn of the Dead then you'll like this one. It's a real hoot! Simon plays an Ace cop who's really serious about his job and he's so good that the other cops want him off the force! So they send him to this backwards town with ""no crime"". But, of course, Simon has a nose for crime.",1384300800,,450,4.067415730337078

2659663,3,B000IOM9VQ,I did not like this nearly as much as Shawn of the Dead. I did not like End of the World as much either. If you can see this movie for free then I would recommend it.,1383782400,,166,3.5135135135135136
2659664,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This is movie #1 for me. I love the humor, and the scenery from the English countryside. I love also the other movies that go with the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" as they have been called, and this being number 2 from the trilogy is the most hilarious for me. For instance, the scene with the farmer and the way the whole incident is treated starting with the guy's dialect and how Pegg needs translation from the oldest police officer up to the incident with the mine. It is a must for me to have it in Blu-ray and of course in my kindle too...Thanks!!!!",1383696000,,546,4.310679611650485

2659666,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is a perfect send-up/homage to all blockbuster action movies. The references are sharp, the satire is in no way mean spirited, and the fact that Pegg and Frost played as far against their Shaun of the Dead alter egos that it seemed fresh instead of a rehash of the former chemistry. The steelbook artwork is fantastic as well, this was definitely a great purchase.",1383609600,,373,4.666666666666667
2659667,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I have to admit that I had few positive expectations about this one. In fact, I was asking myself why I got this one anyway. Well, I certainly got more than I bargained for: this is a funny film. Plenty of slapstick, some doubtful moments when it looked to be going off the rails, but, all-in-all, a funny premise carried through to a very successful conclusion. No details, since much of the fun comes from the surprises, but suffice to say, this tale of a too-successful London police officer sent to the sticks (as we would say), that is, to a quiet country town where nothing ever happens, because he is making his London colleagues look bad by comparison, starts out with the frustration of said officer as he is taught nothing is ever allowed to get in the way of ""nothing ever happens"". I enjoyed it  and think many viewers will also, unless a bit of silliness is beneath their dignity. I recommend giving it a try.",1383523200,,922,4.488095238095238
2659668,5,B000IOM9VQ,My family LOVES this movie. We love Simon Pegg and the dry humor!  There's something about British movies . . . FUNNY!!!,1383436800,,120,4.454545454545454

2659670,4,B000IOM9VQ,"We got turned on to Simon Pegg from his work in ""Shaun of the Dead"". While Hot Fuzz is not quite as funny, it's worth a watch. I'd recommend it.",1382832000,,144,3.8333333333333335
2659671,4,B000IOM9VQ,"if you liked Shaun of the Dead & End of the World you will probably like this one.  No aliens, but still strange inhabitants of an innocent looking village pitted against Simon Pegg's supercop character.  Same type of laughs as in Shaun of the Dead and End of the World.  Very gruesome in places; may disturb some adults and teens/pre-teens with the gore.  Best characterized as a comedy/horror genre.",1382659200,,401,4.768115942028985
2659672,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Simon Pegg plays a straight-laced police officer, Sgt. Angel, who has been transferred to the sleepy little town of Sandford, England.  His new partner, Danny (played with gleeful ineptitude by Nick Frost) loves nothing better than to toss back a pint or two at the pub.  Soon enough some extraordinarily suspicious fatal ""accidents"" begin to occur on a regular basis, and Sgt. Angel is on top of things lickety split.
Timothy Dalton gives a surprising performance with a flare for comedy!  Jim Broadbent and Bill Nighy add their comedic genius touches.

Grab a big bowl of popcorn and a couple of friends because this is an awesome Simon Pegg comedy!  Anything from the mind the man who wrote ""Shaun of the Dead"" is worth giving a shot!!!",1382313600,,739,4.78740157480315

2659675,4,B000IOM9VQ,Stay with this surprisingly funny comedy at the beginning because it is often hard to understand the dialect at times.  Sit back and relax this somewhat slapstick British import.  My wife and I enjoyed it!,1382140800,,205,4.828571428571428
2659700,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is hilarious. That's not a cop-out or a lazy review, that's simply the best way to put it. It simultaneously is the epitome of and sends up the action genre as a whole, referencing Shaun of the Dead, Bad Boys, Point Break, James Bond, and countless other action classics and tropes.
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing, and when combined with Edgar Wright, they are simply unstoppable. Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest movies out there.",1381881600,,446,4.5875

2659707,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is the second movie in the so-called Cornetto Trilogy and it's comedy gold.  These guys know how to write.  It is one of the most finely crafted comedies, let alone movies, I've ever watched and it just gets funnier and funnier to me each time.

Yes... the plot is far fetched (shocking in a movie, I know!) but the acting, the callbacks, and the editing make this one of my all time favorite movies.  There's gore, silliness, explosions, the fastest car chase ever, cop movie homages, sex jokes, and a bevy of incredibly talented English actors who round out the cast: Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, Stephen Merchant, Lucy Punch, Timothy Dalton, Olivia Colman and so many more.  (Be on the lookout for an uncredited cameo by Aussie Cate Blanchett, too, btw!)

I have friends who aren't as enthusiastic about this movie (or Shaun of the Dead, #1 in the Cornetto Trilogy) as I am but it fits perfectly with my sense of humor.  If you liked Super Troopers, you'll find this movie is even more finely crafted, hilarious, and FUN.",1380499200,,1047,4.657608695652174

2659812,4,B000IOM9VQ,This is a very funny movie. The characters are well developed and I laughed from start to finish.  Buy it and watch.,1377561600,,116,4.2727272727272725
2659813,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I liked the story line and the lengths to which people will go be most desirable town to live.

True irony about the ridiculous in life.

You have to have a sense of humor to enjoy this movie.

Paul, Shaun of the dead, and Iron Sky are comparable movies.",1377475200,,254,4.142857142857143
2659814,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I bought this movie because I didn't already own it, despite seeing it numerous times, and needed to remedy that situation. This is, in my opinion, one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The way nearly every plot point and little throwaway line from the beginning of the movie comes back at some point is incredible. Brief disclaimer: it's British, and the humor is British. I personally think its phenomenal, but I know some people don't like British humor, so if that is the case with this movie you probably won't enjoy it.",1377475200,,532,4.610526315789474
2659815,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is simply one of the best comedies of all time, in that, it's comedy is just so dry, smart, and sharp. I love it!",1377475200,,122,3.730769230769231
2659816,5,B000IOM9VQ,GREAT MOVIE AND A TON OF EXTRAS. BE SURE YOU'RE GETTING THE 'ULTIMATE EDITION'. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS GREAT.,1377475200,,117,4.9
2659817,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I don't know why I held off for so long to see this wild, wacky, unique movie featuring the dynamic duo of Simon Pegg & Nick Frost. It's well-written, full of surprises, and best of all, hilarious. If you've seen ""Shaun of the Dead"", you have to see ""Hot Fuzz"" and then ""The World's End"" to experience Pegg/Frost/Wright's ""Cornett Trilogy."" Well worth your time to laugh uproariously.",1377475200,,384,4.746268656716418
2659818,4,B000IOM9VQ,"This is a very well done and very dark comedy.  It is original, funny, odd, and gruesome.  I liked it better than ""Shaun of the Dead"" (also by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), but most people I've asked who like them both seem to like them about the same.  I, also, liked the movie ""Paul"" by Pegg and Frost.  It is not as dark as the other 2 comedies, but it is not for kids, either.",1377388800,,378,3.9342105263157894
2659829,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I love this movie. I loved Shaun of the Dead. I can't wait to see the final installment of the ""Cornetto trilogy"". I'm a huge Simon Pegg fan.

I love the tongue in cheek style in which these actors make fun of classic genres. I don't take the films too seriously and for a change neither do the cast of the film. They enjoy making fun of the stereotypes and they do it in a manner that keeps the film watchable escapist fare.",1377388800,,425,4.120481927710843
2659830,3,B000IOM9VQ,"This may sound strange but to me these guys try to copy Monty Pythons too much.  What made MP good was the extreme visual with the average comedy.  These guys are actually funny and they do not need to make stupid story lines to be funny.

If you like british comedies you will like these guys and this film.",1377302400,,308,4.186440677966102
2659831,5,B000IOM9VQ,A lot of references to Shaun of the dead jokes and the same comedic style. One of my newer favorites,1377302400,,100,4.05

2659833,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is both an homage to and a satire of the ""buddy cop"" movie genre. It is quite excellent, and I highly recommend it.",1377043200,,124,4.0
2659834,5,B000IOM9VQ,No Shaun of the dead. But still a damn good movie. Makes you want to just shoot your gun off in the air.,1377043200,,104,3.5652173913043477
2659835,4,B000IOM9VQ,You will enjoy this movie from the people who made Sean Of The Dead.  I begins slowly but ends up very funny.,1376956800,,109,3.9545454545454546
2659836,5,B000IOM9VQ,British version of a Naked gun type movie.  Great action and just a hilarious movie for adults to see. Must watch,1376697600,,113,4.380952380952381
2659837,5,B000IOM9VQ,"A London cop that's so good at his job he makes everyone else look lazy is ""promted"" to a position in what was supposed to be a village backwater.  He lands there as a bunch of unlikely ""accidents"" begin to take place.  As villagers drop like flys our hero becomes suspicious.  Lots of comedic violence.  The hero cop has a Barney-Fife-Like partner who has a childlike desire to be a cop (never mind that he is already a cop).  Some small jokes go by fast so keep your eyes open: the gag with the swear jar is especially funny.  Also, just when you think you are headed for a cliche ending...you aren't.",1376611200,,603,4.339285714285714
2659838,5,B000IOM9VQ,A great buddy cop movie done with the offbeat humor from the guys who brought you Shaun of the Dead,1376438400,,99,4.0
2659849,3,B000IOM9VQ,"It's funny, but at no point was I really outright laughing as with movies like Anchorman or anything Monthy Python. It's a comedic riff on action movies that left me chuckling a bit. ""Hot"" Fuzz was to me more like ""Luke-warm"" Fuzz.",1376438400,,231,4.523809523809524
2659850,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I'm a big Simon Pegg fan so I really enjoyed this. Not as funny as Shaun of the Dead, but entertaining all together.",1376352000,,116,4.086956521739131
2659851,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This is my favorite of the Write/Pegg/Frost movies so far. While Shaun of the Dead has more comedy, this has a tighter plot with more humanity and significantly better referential treatment to other movies. Angel as the straight man is also a welcome change for Pegg.",1376179200,,267,4.826086956521739
2659852,5,B000IOM9VQ,"A fantastic follow-up to Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's 2004 Shaun of the Dead. Many fans of the so-called ""Cornetto Trilogy"" prefer Hot Fuzz; personally, I love them both equally. It features a slightly different tone but maintains the same quirky, deadpan humor that made Shaun so brilliant. The primary flaw is the over-the-top action ending that many viewers may find alienating, particularly Americans unaccustomed to surreal comedy. I would recommend a purchase, simply because there are so many details that can only be caught upon multiple viewings.",1376179200,,556,5.329545454545454
2659853,5,B000IOM9VQ,it's one of those movies that you would want to keep going back to watch and with the steel book edition its a nice fit to a collection,1376092800,,135,3.857142857142857
2659854,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Great movie. Lots of things to look for, including the foreshadowing of the murders, the humoUr, and other little touches, such as references to what Sgt AngLe has done in gunfights and what actually happens, plus the shortest police chase ever.",1376092800,,245,5.0
2659855,5,B000IOM9VQ,truly just amazing. Simon Pegg and Nicholas Frost are an amazing duo that can do not wrong when it comes to film.,1376006400,,113,4.181818181818182
2659856,5,B000IOM9VQ,This is a great movie. Looking to upgrade some favorites to Blue-Ray and the price was reasonable. Excellent Blue-Ray quality.,1376006400,,126,5.35
2659857,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I love all these Edgar Wright movies. I had been meaning to pick up Hot Fuzz for awhile. I'm huge fan of steelbook cases I think they look great. Love the comic book style they did with it. It was really great too that I got DVD, Blu ray, and and Ultraviolet copy for on $14!",1375574400,,275,3.9285714285714284
2659858,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz covers the spectrum of humor, from over-the-top slapstick to subtle dry British wit.  If you've ever wondered how quaint country villages remain that way, this movie reveals the answer.",1375574400,,194,5.258064516129032
2659869,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Obviously an incredibly amount of work went into this movie, every time I watch it I see something I never noticed before. Tons of foreshadowing, great script, entertaining plot. It's not some dumb parody movie that just makes fun of a genre and has no real plot, this is a completely stand alone great film and deserves every bit of praise it gets.",1375488000,,349,4.555555555555555
2659870,5,B000IOM9VQ,Awesome movie. So many one liners and hidden jokes. Just as good as Shaun of the Dead or better. Instant classic.,1375488000,,113,4.428571428571429
2659871,5,B000IOM9VQ,I love everything Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are in. Nick frost especially in this movie gives a great performance. I laughed from start to finish.,1375315200,,146,4.653846153846154
2659872,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I loved it's quirky offbeat sensibility.  Very enjoyable.  It is clever and funny, violent in a way that fits the material, and a 'go for it' outlandish plot.",1375315200,,158,4.607142857142857
2659873,5,B000IOM9VQ,"If you've seen a buddy cop made in last 20 years (Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys, et. al.) you will find this hilarious.",1375142400,,113,4.181818181818182
2659874,5,B000IOM9VQ,This is the best cop drama spoof ever! I have to repurchase it every time there is a format change.,1375056000,,99,4.0
2659875,5,B000IOM9VQ,A must-see. This perfect combination of melodrama and action makes this masterfully timed action comedy an absolute pleasure to watch.,1374710400,,134,5.75
2659876,5,B000IOM9VQ,"You would think that the ""buddie cop"" angle couldn't be improved or changed, but did and it's gold. A plot deep enough to make the jokes gold yet simple enough to make the laughs amazing. They done it again and I couldn't be happier.",1374710400,,233,4.318181818181818
2659877,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I loved ""Hot Fuzz"" when I first saw it, and it's even better with each subsequent viewing. I think Pegg and company are some of the best ""new"" moviemakers to come along in ages. Strongly recommended!",1374624000,,199,4.555555555555555
2659878,5,B000IOM9VQ,"If you are a Simon Pegg fan you'll love this movie.  It's got humor, action and a mystery.  There are quite a few nods to previous Pegg movies - most notably the Shaun of the Dead 'jumping over the fence'.",1374451200,,205,4.1
2659879,5,B000IOM9VQ,The Simon Pegg-Nick Frost combo is always a win. Nice to have a blu ray copy for the big tv in the living room and a DVD for the bedroom.,1374451200,,137,3.6
2659880,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I soooo love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together in movies! My first experience with them was Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did not disappoint! My 16 year old son told me that the steel book versions were a must for a video collection and I have to say they're pretty darn awesome! we just bought the trilogy Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and now Paul. Definitely a must have for the Pegg/Frost collector!!!",1374278400,,406,4.285714285714286
2659881,5,B000IOM9VQ,I really love this movie.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a great team.  And with director Edgar Wright you can't go wrong.  Funny from start to finish.  And I hope this team makes lots of movies together.  Hope to see the Andy's in a future film.,1373414400,,246,4.148936170212766
2659882,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hey, it's fantastic, it'll have you surprised and it will keep you laughing. There isn't much more you need to know. These guys are hilarious.",1372291200,,142,4.72
2659883,4,B000IOM9VQ,"For Americans, what can I say, but ""British humor."" You either appreciate it or you don't. I think this movie is hilarious",1372032000,,122,4.590909090909091
2659884,5,B000IOM9VQ,Irreverent british humor that leaves me in stitches every time I watch it. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys british comedy.,1371945600,,126,4.7727272727272725
2659885,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I agree with what one viewer said, ""British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves. HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.""",1371859200,,438,4.289156626506024
2659886,5,B000IOM9VQ,It was truly funny. The accents made it more funny. I'd watch it again and again. One part was too gruesome for my eyes though lol.,1371772800,,131,4.076923076923077
2659887,1,B000IOM9VQ,"I was excited to watch it, but...  boring, seldom funny.  I kept waiting for it to do something with what it was trying to develop, but it never happened and then it degraded ridiculously.  So sad, I'll never get that 2 hours back -- its gone forever.  Do yourself a favor, rent ANYthing other than this.",1371686400,3,304,4.375
2659888,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Movie is great, Blu ray and DVD feature wonderful, but, Digital Copy Expiration Date is not April 30, 2015, it is 12/31/2012 -- that's right 2012!",1371254400,,146,4.653846153846154
2659899,5,B000IOM9VQ,I'm gonna cut to the chase here and say that this is by far the funniest british comedy I've ever seen. Watch the trailer on YouTube to get a sense of the plot but the two main actors work amazingly well together. Their characters provide you with stupid and witty humor and it keeps going and going. I've probably watched this movie more than any other movie I own just because the story line is easy to follow and it is so funny you can watch it in bits and still be satisfied. Give it a shot!,1370390400,,495,4.11340206185567
2659900,5,B000IOM9VQ,This movie is very funny and since i have a cop in my family its even better. Everyone in the house likes this movie,1370304000,,116,3.875
2659901,3,B000IOM9VQ,Worth watching if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead with the same actors. Not much else to say about it.,1370044800,,100,4.05
2659902,4,B000IOM9VQ,"This has a fast start and slows a bit in the middle, but overall is a fun, funny film. A really good set of cameo stars. Would love to have seen more of Bill Bailey.",1369872000,,165,3.742857142857143
2659903,5,B000IOM9VQ,"LOVE, love, love this movie. Hilarious. ""For the greater good."" You will be in stiches over this film. Love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as a duo. So worth it.",1369353600,,156,4.233333333333333
2659904,2,B000IOM9VQ,To me the film was to gory and not very funny. It was a spoof but did entertain me.  This was the first movie I have paid and streamed from amazon. I should have saved my money.,1369180800,,177,3.7837837837837838

2659906,5,B000IOM9VQ,"REALLY FUNNY. AFTER I SAW THIS MOVIE ON TV, I HAD TO GET IT.  ABOUT A COP IN ENGLAND WHO WAS SO GOOD THAT HE WAS PUTTING THE OTHERS TO SHAME. SO HE WAS TRANSFERRED, AGAINST HIS WILL TO ANOTHER CITY WHERE PEOPLE BROKE THE LAW AND THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE",1368662400,,259,3.8867924528301887
2659907,5,B000IOM9VQ,Another classic example of Amazon.com not knowing their left hand from their right hand.  Both Widescreen and regular are on the same disk.  I purchased just ONE disk not two.  Maybe they expected me to watch it both ways and that I am to review the movie twice.  If I wanted to watch any of these movies twice it would have been PAUL That is one super great flick.,1368489600,,365,4.246376811594203
2659908,4,B000IOM9VQ,"The hilarious and versatile duo are back, after I fell in love with them in Shaun of the Dead.  This movie took a few watches for me to get in to (possibly because I have to turn on the subtitles to really catch all the british-isms), but the more I've seen it the more I've come to love it.  And Timothy Dalton is deliciously evil.",1368144000,,332,4.092307692307692
2659919,5,B000IOM9VQ,I dig this flick. The main characters work well in every movie I've seen them in. The comedy is British... have to love the sometimes dry humor.,1368057600,,144,4.37037037037037
2659920,4,B000IOM9VQ,Funny with a dark underpinning.  I like Simon Pegg and Hot Fuzz helped that along.  I laughed and I worried because there was more than just craziness.  But I was cheering his character on all the way.,1367539200,,201,4.378378378378378
2659921,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost reunite with Director Edgar Wright to make a very funny action film. Playing the role of the top cop Nicholas Angel, Simon really rises to the occasion, playing a very serious character who is very unlike his previous character of Shawn.

When Nicholas gets transferred to the small village of Sandord, his seriousness and style doesn't endear him to the locals, with the exception of Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), who sees him as something of a role model.

When a few people die in mysterious accidents, Angel doesn't buy it and finds a suspect in the owner of the local supermarket: Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton).

From there, things get even more unusual, but the funny rarely stops except to carefully weave in serious moments as needed.

Another star studded cast, though I knew only a few of them myself, it is a cast that works exceptionally well. There are also a number of movie references that make the film that much more enjoyable. The outtakes, deleted scenes, the commentary, and the Fuzzball Rally (a video of the American tour and interviews that Pegg, Frost, and Wright conducted) are very entertaining. The Fuzz track for captions gives the watcher fun facts about behind the scenes info as you watch the movie.

All in all, I cannot recommend this movie enough.",1367539200,,1308,4.821428571428571

In their review for Your Highness I believe the mention this movie. As for this movie itself, I have seen it twice so far, ready to watch it again when I get the chance. What impressed me most were the characters--well writen and well executed. I enjoyed all the music and movie references worked in; if overt, it was also endearing, otherwise used subtly and sparingly. If you enjoy buddy movies, police movies, or satire, I recommend it.",1366761600,,568,4.633663366336633

While not quite as brilliant as Shaun of the Dead the ultimate understated zombie comedy, here they've taken a seeminly quiet award winning town and turned it into an unusual cop flick with a brilliantly funny action packed closing scene.  The chemistry between the two actors/friends and director is unmistakeable.  What I would give to be a fly on the wall on the set.",1366156800,,473,4.607142857142857

Yes, like Sean of the Dead, the movie, and many of the images, are twisted and not for the young or faint of heart - but they are done with great effect, with humor, and in support of a very good story.  Great supporting cast too.",1362009600,,307,4.016393442622951

It amazed me when I first saw the film how many middle age, middle class criminals were in this story; you don't often see this demographic as law breakers, so it was very funny that way too.  My first Simon Pegg, Nick Frost movie - I went looking for their projects after this.  Great actors.",1362009600,,389,4.608695652173913

I hope they keep making more movies like this because these are really enjoyable and great to rewatch. It is pretty timeless even though it is a few years old it is just as funny as it was when it came out.

The whole thing is so far fetched that you just can't  help laughing at the irony dripping off of every surface.  There is no particular message, except that Hollywood still fails to recognize the stupidity of making the same cop movies over and over and over and..... you get the idea.  Dirty Hairy and Die Hard were interesting the first two or three times but Lord help me if I ever end up in hell watching an endless loop of ""DeBeque and Barnsville CSI Special Squad.""  This movie treats the good cop forced beyond the bounds of legality to defend the peace with about the respect it deserves, none.  The climax when the confiscated (Spoiler Alert) Polish wz. 08/39 contact naval mine the local pig farmer had in his barn explodes really tears at the stomach, as you laugh yourself silly.

Having said that I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would based off of Shawn of the Dead.  The humor was mostly on, but some of it just missed the mark slightly which detracts from the overall movie for me.

It is worth buying if you can get a decent deal on it.  4 Stars.",1354233600,,435,3.6956521739130435

I didn't know solving a string of murders could be so funny.

This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's up there with The Big Lebowski and Super Troopers. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are hilarious. The amount of comedy in this movie is ridiculous.

However one complaint with this movie is that the death and actions scenes can get a bit gory/messy (but if you like that kind of action then it doesn't matter then). The humor itself is great overall and can sometimes be really dry (but that is British humor for you). A great movie in short!",1352246400,,396,4.513888888888889

This is also the second film in Simon Pegg's trilogy, so it's a must watch!",1351468800,,327,3.8656716417910446

2660101,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Shaun of the Dead was the first of the Flavours Cornetto Trilogy by Edgar Wright, playing on the best aspects of a buddy movie and zombie film. This movie, Hot Fuzz, is more of a play on a buddy movie and action films. The third installment is The Worlds End, a movie about an epic pub crawl slated to come out sometime next year. Hot Fuzz for me, succeeded in taking all the cool elements of action films the same way Shaun of the Dead succeeded in playing up all the cool things done in traditional zombie films. Hot Fuzz is totally British in cast and setting and yet totally American at the same time since most of the movie is an obvious nod to American action films. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play off each other as well as they did since I first saw them in Spaced, together. Hot Fuzz pops on Blu-Ray, it retains the natural look of the film grain but is very polished with sharp detail and vibrant colors. Loaded with special features, if you don't own this on Blu-Ray, you need to. If you own it on DVD and weren't quite sure about buying it a second time, you need to upgrade to the Blu-Ray version. While there isn't any real additional content, this is one of the cleanest looking movies I've seen on Blu-Ray and is a must own in my opinion.",1348185600,,1253,4.2468619246861925

I am a big fan of Shaun of the Dead, but I honestly think that this is even better. I would describe it as a dark comedy that by turns is clever and silly and sly and slapstick.  It's sweet and salty and chock full of nuts:D
There is some tongue in cheek naughtiness to the dialogue so I would only consider it a 'family movie' if your kids are a little older.  And while there is technically a lot of violence, it is mostly of the over the top comedic variety.",1346889600,,638,4.0078740157480315

2660133,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This is a great comedy. It has that fun quirky indie feel to it with none of the low budget drippy music let down. Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel. Angel is London's greatest policeman. In fact he is too good and makes the rest of the force look bad. They promote him and railroad him out to Sanford, a village which constantly wins ""Village of the Year"" awards. They have a low crime rate, primarily because the police don't arrest anyone, a British version of Mayberry. This puts Angel at odds with everyone in town, whom remain polite as he seemingly busts everyone in the peaceful village. The comedy is greater good. While on duty and sitting in a pub with fellow policemen, they talk about firearms.

Andie: ""Everyone in town and their mum owns a gun.""
Angel: ""Such as who?""
Andie: ""Farmers own guns.""
Angel: ""And who else?""
Andie: ""And their mums.""

Nick Frost plays PC Danny Butterman who becomes Angel's sidekick. He loves police movies and admires Angel. Together they become a crime fighting duo in a village that has a secret.

2660155,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I love dark comedies. I love anything British! This movie was the best of both in my opinion. There is a small town attitude that is really funny and subtle at first. I can't rave enough about this movie, but I really wanted to review this edition. This edition is a Blu-ray DVD with digital copy. The only thing that I did not like about it was the fact that you have to go to a website and download the digital copy. This should be included in the description because not all people have a high speed connection. I live out in the boonies and it is impossible to download a file this big. I will have to go into town to find a high speed wifi which is inconvenient. It is much better when companies include the disc on these editions. Another thing that I find unappealing is the fact that the digital copy can go out of date. My copy says that the code May not work after 12-31-2012. I have found that if you buy one of these and the code is out of date then try it anyway. I have had success with codes even after the expiration date, so it is worth a try.

This edition has a few bonus features like
Outtakes
22 Deleted scenes
5 Feature commentaries
Special effects: Before and After

2660156,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This is best movie i'v ever seen! It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it makes you want to get off your lazy butt and go kick other people's. Don't even think about not watching this movie!",1320883200,,195,4.0256410256410255
2660157,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I first saw this in the theatre with my wife, expecting a sort of British Naked Gun/Police Squad-type spoof (according to how the TV commercials portrayed it) and was very pleasantly surprised.  Hot Fuzz quickly became, and remains, my all-time favorite movie ever, an amazingly seamless, energetic, hilarious, flat-out wonderful blend of action, murder mystery, horror, slapstick, satire, jokes, and unforgettable characters.

It starts with a promising and genuinely funny premise (Overachieving big-city cop gets reassigned to sleepy country town because he's making the big city officers look bad!) and gets surprisingly complicated but never chaotic.  If anything, it gets better and better, with a rushing, but always witty quick-cut pizzazz that reminds me of everyone from Russ Meyer to Martin Scorsese.

It turns out the stars and director, unknown to me at the time, cut their teeth many years prior on a BBC TV sitcom called Spaced, a sort of grungier, more eccentric version of the American sitcom Friends, notable for its many quick-cut, lunatic fantasy sequences (a quirk subsequently adopted by How I Met Your Mother...although probably not all that original to anyone who remembers the Monkees!)

Back to Hot Fuzz (and about time).  As is typical of Great Movies, Hot Fuzz has all the right ingredients: a tight, witty script by star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright; an abundance of such top-flight British character actors as Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, an amusingly slimy turn by former James Bond Timothy Dalton, and memorable cameos from Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, and Bill Bailey.  Pegg and his co-star Nick Frost resemble a more modern and definitely more believable Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, and the movie is much propelled by their natural charm and chemistry.

On the commentary track Pegg and Wright agree that with DVDs filmmakers feel obliged to add as much detail as possible to warrant repeat viewings and indeed Hot Fuzz has so much going on you'll want to watch it again and again, and, I predict that, like me, you'll always be glad you did.

Of course a lot of people may remember Pegg & Frost & Co. from their classic zombie spoof Shaun of the Dead but in my humble opinion Hot Fuzz is a superior, more original piece of work, full of great comic timing and witty, endlessly-quotable lines and gags, and, as I intimated before, a genuinely funny story. Add a great soundtrack and startling plot twists all the way through, and this most modern and boisterous of action/buddy movie/comedy/murder mysteries adds up to that most old-fashioned but welcome of things: a truly GREAT movie night!",1320105600,2,2634,5.050691244239632
2660158,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Great British take on American action films from the great minds that brought us Sean of the Dead.

2660160,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz (directed by Edgar Wright, and starring Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward and Paul Freeman) is one of the funniest comedies I've seen in the past decade.  It's also one damn cool action flick, too!  The action scenes are not only completely amazing to watch.  They also pay perfectly loving homage to just about every buddy-cop film made within the past 30 years.

The movie itself (rating 5/5):

I'll keep the plot synopsis as short as possible:

Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg) of London's Metropolitan Police force is one top cop.  He graduated from the academy at the absolute top of his class.  And, for the past few years, his arrest record has been putting everyone else to shame.  So much so, that his superiors decide to transfer him to the sleepy little village of Sandford, to save the rest of the police force from further embarrassment by comparison!

In Sandford, Angel's new boss, Inspector Frank Butterman (Broadbent), is a good-natured and likeable old fellow.  Butterman's son, Police Constable Danny Butterman (Frost), is a bit of a screw-up.  But, he's a loveable screw-up, and he always means well.

Almost immediately after Sergeant Angel arrives in town, certain high-profile citizens start meeting untimely, and sometimes-gruesome, ends.  Angel suspects that none of them were accidents, and that all of them are connected.  Unfortunately for him, almost no one in town wants to believe that a serial killer may be in their midst!  It's up to Sergeant Angel and Constable Butterman to figure out what the hell is going on, and put an end to all the mayhem.

When the movie is trying to be funny, it's VERY funny!  And, when it's trying to be action-packed and no-holds-barred violent, it's very much those things, too!  And the best part is: sometimes the movie is all three things at once!  Edgar Wright's directing is spot-on!  Even though this is only his second major feature film (Shaun of the Dead was his first), if you didn't know any better, you'd think he's been directing comedies and action films for years and years.  His directing skill is THAT good!  And the acting performances by both Pegg and Frost are also excellent.  Funny when they need to be, and surprisingly convincing and effective in all the action scenes, these two obviously have a great time together and a great love for all the action films that this one is lampooning.  And, man, Timothy Dalton sure had lots of fun in his role as the snooty owner of the local supermarket!  In fact, he has some of the funniest lines in the film.

The video quality (3.5/5):

Basically, it's good but not great.  And the weird thing is it varies from scene to scene.  Some parts of the film look spectacular, with nary a blemish to be seen.  Other scenes, like the opening shot for example, have noticeable edge-enhancement.  I also spotted some compression artifacts here and there.  Overall the video quality, while not horrible, is such a crap-shoot that it can get frustrating if you're a videophile like me.  I suspect, though, that the erratic video quality is a direct result of all the audio options available.  Something obviously had to be sacrificed in order to have enough space on the disc.  And, speaking of the audio...

The audio quality (5/5):

The film's main audio comes in three language options: English Dolby Digital 5.1-EX, French Dolby Digital 5.1-EX and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1-EX.  There are also optional subtitles in those same three languages.  Damn, this film's audio kicks all flavors and colors of a**!  The dialogue comes through the center channel crystal-clear at all times, even during the film's more action-intense moments.  And those action-intense moments will make your fronts, surrounds and subwoofer beg for mercy!  They may also make all your neighbors pound on your front door, demanding that you turn it down.  And it's not just the action scenes that make full use of all your speakers.  Even the quieter moments have great aural ambiance to them.  Also, the music comes at you from all channels, too.  All-in-all, this is one of the best surround experiences I've ever heard on standard-def DVD.

The bonus materials (5/5):

Five.  Count them: FIVE audio commentaries are included along with the main movie on the first disc of this three-disc package!  And the best thing is, they're all worth listening to at least once.  Here's how the audio commentaries break down:

Commentary 1:  The filmmakers (actor/co-writer Simon Pegg and director/co-writer Edgar Wright)
Commentary 2:  The Sandford Police (actors Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Rafe Spall, Kevin Eldon and Olivia Colman)
Commentary 3:  The Village people (actors Kenneth Cranham, Timothy Dalton, Paul Freeman and Edward Woodward)
Commentary 4:  The REAL Police (police officers Andy Leafe and Nick Eckland)
Commentary 5:  The celebrity commentary (director/co-writer Edgar Wright and his new best friend and fellow director Quentin Tarantino!)

In addition to the commentaries on the first disc, there's also the Fuzz-O-Meter optional trivia subtitle track, which I found to be both entertaining and informative.

The other extras included in this set include an extended version of The Fuzz-Ball Rally documentary (it's quite a few minutes longer than the version found on the single-disc release of Hot Fuzz) which includes it's own optional audio commentary, ""Dead Right"" which was one of director Edgar Wright's earliest filmmaking efforts (he shot it on VHS when he was a teenager) and his very first cop film (it features TWO audio commentaries: one with Edgar Wright, and the other with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost making comments and jokes about the film AND about Wright's commentary!), 22 deleted scenes, lots of video blogs, eight other featurettes focusing on various different aspects of the making of the film, outtakes, a special effects before-and-after comparison, ""Hot Funk"" which hilariously demonstrates how some of the more profanity-laden scenes have been cleaned up for the eventual network television broadcasts of Hot Fuzz, plot-holes and comparisons, storyboards and a few other cool little goodies.

Overall rating (4.5/5 for the entire three disc set):

Hot Fuzz is a very satisfying film to watch.  The comedy is very funny, and the action scenes are some of the best ever put to celluloid!  If you're a fan of Hot Fuzz, you should already own this three-disc set.  And, if you're a fan of the film, but you don't own this set...what the hell is wrong with you???  Even if you've never seen Hot Fuzz, but you love comedies or you love being blown out of your seat by intense, white-knuckled action scenes, you should still own this set.  You'll be in for a real treat!  The film alone is worth the purchase price, but the excellent bonus materials definitely sweeten the deal!

To sum things up:  this Three-Disc Collector's Edition of Hot Fuzz is worth owning, in spite of the sometimes-questionable video quality, and comes highly recommended!",1317513600,,7028,5.009499136442142

2660163,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz(released Apr/07)stars everyone's fave English sensations Simon Pegg and Nick Frost starring as Constable Nicholas Angel and Constable Butterman,respectively. Pegg and Frost are closerthanthis in real life and they also brought in their friend director/writer Edgar Wright,and when all is said and done they whipped up a winner of a movie.
The plot takes place in London,England(I had to say that because I live in that city in Ontario!).Const. Angel is a supercop of sorts,graduating highest in his class from the police academy,earning all sorts of awards in his career and basically showing up every other living and breathing person to put on a cop uniform within the greater London area. One day he is pulled into his superiors offices to be told that he is to be transferred to a sleepy little town miles north of the city,called Sandford.
He arrives in town only to almost immediately arrest the entire clientele of a local there,thereby,for all intents and purposes,shutting it down. One of the people he arrests that night happens to be the son of the Police Chief Frank Butterman. The town(and the movie as a whole)is populated with a plethora of off the wall characters and Angel has a tough time of it fitting in. One day he stumbles onto a clue that something is very amiss in Sandford after a local business man gets blown up in his own home,and that the suspected perpetrator might be the owner of a local supermarket. Then the local writer of a newspaper is killed trying to provide Angel with an important clue and Angel soon after witnesses the murder of a shopkeeper,dying horribly by gardening shears. The perp is a hooded figure and when Angel gives chase,as fast as he is,he cannot fathom the  unbelievable speed of the pursued who he loses.
Circumstances are now rolling along like an out of control snowball with his colleagues all sneering at his bravado and no one in which to turn to for help. He is jumped upon at his apartment but manages to survive the attack and he eventually uncovers a meeting situated at the old churchyard with all the local business leaders gathered around a table like a witches coven,in hooded garb. He runs but is captured by who he thought was his only friend Constable Butterman,who takes him outside the village to send him packing back to London. As he is about halfway back he is at a rest stop and it is there he decides to stop running and return to clean up the town once and for all.
Upon arrival he immediately enters the police station,obtains a load of illegal weapons,straps them on,obtains a horse and rides down the main street to stop near the towns square. Wearing shades and ready for action he is in short order shot at by all of the business people involved in the twisted plot in Sandford. Constable Butterman didn't believe Angel before but he quickly realizes there has to be something to it as he rises to the occasion to help his friend. They take down most of the opposition but the Police Chief and the local supermarket owner escape by car. The Police Chief runs into a tree while Angel and the supermarket owner duke it out in a miniature village. It all ends as the owner gets impaled on a miniature church's steeple.
The movie comes to an end as all the towns business men and women involved are arrested and booked and Angel and Butterman,a year on,are close friends and keeping the streets of Sandford safe from any and all criminal element.
Thoroughly enjoyable from more than a few different angles,this film is both funny and irreverent and boasts a wonderful supporting cast of actors to help them in their 121 minute romp on celluloid. Timothy Dalton is among the cast and his impalement on the church steeple is nothing short of cringing....ouch! Kind of a turnabout is fair play thing,as it was Dalton's character that sent a church steeple down upon the reporter who was to clue Angel in,earlier in the flick.
This three disc set is nothing short of fantastic. The first disc is pretty much what is contained in the single disc release but it gets much better. Into the second disc and third you will discover facts,trivia and behind the scenes info that will keep you enthralled for literally hours,in fact FIVE to be exact! I can't possibly list all the features in detail but generally you are looking at:the video of their pre-release tour of the U.S. with the movie and its reactions at various points along the way with its two main stars and director Wright,and it's,well...you'll just have to watch to see,a plethora of deleted scenes and outtakes,commentaries on almost all the features,eight featurettes,a look at the S/FX,23 vid blogs,a look at Wright's first cop film,many other inside looks at just about every angle of the film making process including stunt driving training for the cars used in the film,etc,etc. Whew! If you loved the film you will love all of this stuff as they couldn't have done it up any better.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is clear and crisp,along with the dynamite sound.
All in all,this is as good as it gets folks for all fans of this movie;and I can't imagine who wouldn't or couldn't be one.

It is one of my all time favorites!
I bought the three disk version because of the bonus features, or what I thought would be anyway.
I am a film fanatic, so I love to watch the making of  in order to see what it took to put all of the cinematic magic together.
Unfortunately, the making of and featuretts are more of the people introducing each other and being silly, which is great if thats what you are looking for.
I was looking for insights into how each shot was put together and filmed, this was explained to a certain degree in some parts, but certainly not up to my expectations, especially for such a phenomenal film.
I love the movie, hence the four stars, the case is super cool, and the pictures fun to boot, but the making of( the main reason for why I bought the edition with bonuses) did not live up to expectations.",1315267200,,851,4.253086419753086

The editing, the soundtrack, the changes in tone, the over-the-top premise, the insanely loud sound effects - it's all a ridiculous amount of fun.

Simon Pegg plays the role of that super-cop who ends up being partnered with the Captain's goofball son `Danny'... who is his complete polar opposite and completely out of it! They both begin to influence each other with their positives and they both end up being better people...

The comedy factor in the movie was rather enjoyable and made me watch this one over and over many times. I think that if you've enjoyed `Shaun of the Dead' then you will enjoy this one as well as it closely follows in its comedy style.

The ending struggle near the end of the movie was a bit too graphic for my taste and makes me cringe every time I see it... but it hasn't made me loose my lunch yet!

Hot Fuzz is a buddy cop action/comedy but doesn't slap you in the face with blatant, tactless humor as so many of its predecessors. All of Wright's movies are meant to be watched repeatedly so you can catch ALL the times he re-uses lines that were used previously in a different context. It's brilliant.

According to the inside rumors  Santa Claus was Peter Jackson and the ex girlfriend was Cate Blanchett but since both of them are masked its hard to verify.  Lots of gags and other such jokes with physical humor included.  Helps if you like British humor.  Timothy Dalton, former James Bond, plays a smarmy villain.  A lot of the story points are way way way way (waaaaaayyy!!!) over the top but if you go in knowing this is a goofy satire, well, you should be okay.  It helps if you've seen a lot of movie references they are making but it's not required for you to enjoy the film.  If you are a total movie buff a lot of the supporting cast were villains and foils in older action buddy pictures.

2660204,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Okay, I ddin't actually pee my pants, but I almost did.

This is the funniest movie I have seen in years! I know I was missing a lot of the inside jokes because I don't watch a lot of cop movies (haven't ever seen Bad Boys 2, been years since I saw Point Break) and even though I watch a ton of british comedies, I know some of that stuff still eluded me due to language differences. But even with all that, I was laughing nearly the entire way through.

The editing for this movie is insanely good. Simon's movies always have the best transitions, something I think that transfered over from his Spaced days. (MINOR SPOILERS) For example, the part where the cloaked murderer beats the guy in the face with a baton transitions smoothly into Sgt. Angel falling into his chair to watch the movie. So genious! these little things are what make a good movie into a great one. It's that attention to detail in every part of this movie that shows the love the creators have in their work. When someone loves what they are creating this much, then the audience is bound to as well.

Characters are vivid and memorable, but there are just too many to keep them all straight with one viewing. Good excuse for me to watch this over and over. Awesome performances by all, esp. Timothy Dalton, Nick and Simon.

This movie is kind of a comedy/action/slasher hybrid. It does a fairly good job of balancing all these elements, though comedy seems to be the thread that ties them all together. There isn't much action for the first part of the movie, just comedy. Then the slasher mystery starts, and then the action. At first, I was really put off by the switch in tone from light comedy to slasher movie, as there wasn't much setup for this in the beginning. This is really the only thing I can find wrong with the movie. The good news is they do a good job of establishing the slasher portion and the disorientation from the switch in tone (a problem they also had with Shaun) wears off. The movie closes with perhaps the best and most satisfying ending to any action movie I have ever seen. I was fist-pumping with joy and shouts of ""yes!"" the entire time (hangs head in embarrasment). It has everything! A big scooby-doo reveal, a reversal, massive gun battle (think John Woo), a car chase, a hand-to-hand fight, and an ""explosive"" finale. If at any point you were unconvinced that they weren't taking themselves seriously, the ending will safely do away with that notion, heh hehh.

Pegg throws in every cop movie cliche and then some, plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor, campy action sequences, and brilliantly cheesy one-liners. I really can't say how freaking awesome this movie is, it is just something you will have to experience for yourself. I liked it so much I just bought it on blu ray, minutes after watching a copy I checked out from the library. I never do that, so that says a lot.

If you don't like this movie, I will hit you with a shovel.",1300147200,2,2943,4.491588785046729

2660206,4,B000IOM9VQ,"'Hot Fuzz' is basically the story of a big time policeman who is transferred to a sleepy country village and tries to settle in there. He starts to notice some unusual accidents around village life and starts to investigate them with both hilarious and chilling (as far as the film is concerned) consequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both excellent in this film and I found it to have a lot more laugh out loud moments in it than 'Shaun of the Dead'. Pegg is his funniest when he is being frustrated and pedantic when not utilizing his top policing skills in this sleepy, laid back village. Frost reminds you of a big soppy dog, as he eagerly learns from Peggs character and tries to emulate him, often to hilarious effect. Overall this is a fun film, with many hilarious scenes and gags, and although some of the violent scenes are pretty gross, they take a back seat to the humour in this film. Well worth a viewing.

2660245,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is an exceptional and very gung-ho London police officer. He's earned nine commendations within the past year alone. He owns the highest arrest record, and has been wounded three times in the line of duty. And he's making everyone else on the metropolitan police force look bad. Rampant resentment in the work room leads to Sgt. Angel's reassignment to the cheery, rustic village of Sandford.

To an intense cop who can't let go of the job, Sandford is a living hell in which nothing much happens, and it happens all the time. But looks can be deceiving, first impressions are sometimes wonky. In the friendly confines of Sanford hides a murderous conspiracy, and it isn't too long before our newest town bobby catches a whiff of the shady. It begins with a series of grisly accidents...

It's a delicate balance, what these guys come up with, and it's fantastic to see the mad geniuses behind SHAUN OF THE DEAD marvelously live up to expectations with HOT FUZZ. The whole thing could have easily tumbled like a house of cards, but the writers and the director and the actors - especially the awesomely deadpan Simon Pegg - play it straight, which adds resonance to the story, makes the comedy bits so much the better. It helps, too, that there's this edgy flavor to the action sequences, an intensity to the chases and the gun battles and to Angel's run-ins with the killer in that black hood cloak robe thingee.

Pegg and Nick Frost - who plays Angel's bumbling partner in this picture - continue that most excellent buddy chemistry they had going on in SHAUN OF THE DEAD and even in the British television comedy SPACED. In a neat twist, Pegg abandons his patented sad nerd persona for that of an unflappable, unstoppable supercop. Meanwhile, ex-007 Timothy Dalton comes in as the diabolical villain of the piece. I like these topsy-turvies.

You can appreciate HOT FUZZ either as a rollicking send-up of buddy cop pictures or as an action thriller in its own right, or even as both. The film earns its slickness via its rapid-fire edits and ungodly loud special effects, especially when it arrives at the final act as our hot fuzz and a cadre of heavily armed perps shoot it out in the quiet streets of Sandford and then in the supermarket aisles. There is also a swan. It's that kind of movie.",1284940800,,2335,4.68780487804878
2660246,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I bought this movie on DVD and watched in twice before I realized that I really enjoyed it. The first time through, some parts I thought were just ""stupid"" but then I realized that the movie isn't meant to make any sense, really. It is SUPPOSED to be ridiculous, and with that mindset the movie becomes a lot more fun.

It does run nearly two hours, which is a bit long for this sort of film, but it's an easy watch. The story is a bit hard to follow -- especially when the whole ""cult"" thing starts getting explained, but upon repeated viewings it starts to make a bit more sense.

Some of the gags and jokes become more funny upon repeated viewings. The film degenerates into absolute chaos during the final 30 minutes or so, but the gun battles are fun in a ridiculous ""nobody dies"" sense. Or rather, not that many people die. Give the film a chance -- some of it is subtle British humor, other parts are slapstick.",1282435200,,918,4.3313953488372094
2660247,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This is one of my favorite movies and I was so excited to get it as soon as it was shipped. Luckily, it was on my doorstep within a few days from when I ordered it. Great service!!! Thank you",1282176000,,191,3.8
2660278,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I like a variety of film types, but I generally prefer realistic ones.  Hot Fuzz is not even remotely realistic, and if I were some kind of anal, emotionless reviewer (I've read things from many of those), I would slaughter the film for its inconsistencies.

But, I'm not.  I'm a normal human who likes to laugh, and this movie makes me do just that...over and over and over.  I have watched Hot Fuzz probably 10 times and I am STILL catching new little details that I missed before.  If I could use one word to sum up what makes Hot Fuzz so good, it would be the fact that it is ""CLEVER.""  Yes, the acting is pretty good, the filming is excellent, and the story is...if not probable, entertaining...but the film's coherence, irony, and subtle puns are where it really delivers.

A couple of things are needed to really enjoy this movie (provided you enjoy funny movies even when their premise is silly).  The first is a good knowledge of British slang, and the second is subtitles, at least the first time around.  Due to my choice to not use subtitles, I am still, as I said, catching tidbits here and there of dialogue, not to mention visuals.  Once you can understand and comprehend what's being said, though, you'll love this film.

Since I hope we can all agree the movie isn't meant to be realistic, I'll just laughingly mention the few glaring flaws in common sense (which I believe were intentional).  The final gun battle was hilarious.  Nobody could aim well enough to hit the broad side of a barn, and the sheer scale of the battle was mere audacity.  The ease with which Angel turned the other cops from being rude and dismissive (especially the detectives) to joining his side enthusiastically, in the face of their screaming Inspector, was quite ludicrous.  And, of course, the entire premise of ""killing people for the slightest possible construed offense"" (such as Tiller, for planning to leave town and ""share her horticultural expertise with other villages"") was nonsensical.  Yes, the film's ENTIRE PREMISE was a joke.

Did that make me scoff and roll my eyes?  Not at all.  I did wish there was a little more development of Angel turning the cops to join his cause, but otherwise, epic gun fight and silly central theme included, I thought the film was spectacular.  Again, the clever dialogue and the intricate cohesiveness are what really give this a 5-star rating in my book.  It's hard to verbally describe what I mean, but the way events and comments are timed, and the subtle background details that accompany them, work together like a puzzle or a fine clock.  Quotes from early in the film are repeated later in a completely different context.  One of my favorite details is the dual reference to ""Aaron A. Aaronson""; watch the film and you'll see what I mean.

Irony also finds a strong use in the film, be it the subtle irony in each person's name (Angel is a near-flawless do-gooder, Butterman Jr. is obese, Tiller is a gardener, Hatcher delivers babies, etc.); the irony that each ""action cop"" stunt that Danny wishes to perform, he gets to later on; or the irony that Skinner is finally stopped by the only TRUE ""accident"" in the film (tripping over the toy truck).  The screenwriters here were masters of clever tricks and I loved it.

What's more, the filming is delightful.  I really like the style employed here, as in Shaun of the Dead, with fast montages of various simple actions leading from one regular-paced scene to the next (such as in Angel's journey, via trains and taxi, from London to Sandford, or his initial entry to his hotel room).  Other film tricks that I enjoyed were fast compilations of various camera angles, such as when Doctor Hatcher pumps his shotgun during the gunfight, in which I counted 6 or 7 layered camera angles that actually made the action somewhat ""slow-mo"" as it contained a repeat of the same scene, all within the span of 2 seconds or so.

In summary, Hot Fuzz is a brilliant movie that reflects hours of careful planning, stunning acting and delivery, innovative and snappy filming, and of course a ludicrous, overly crazy plot that only adds to the fun rather than making the movie suck.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh, is not offended by profanity, and can handle considerable gore.",1282089600,,4302,4.68218085106383

2660309,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Sometimes a satire goes beyond just satire. ""Hot Fuzz"" makes fun of the common over the top police buddy films by giving us the usual unlikely couple taken to extremes. Nicholas Angel is more than ""by the book""-- he lives the book, and his partner Danny is a caricature of the slightly inept, slightly lazy policeman. The relationship between the two is played for the usual laughs against a British community that is just a little too perfect and a little too peaceful.

And then the movie sneaks up on us as the two partners get to genuinely like one another and we get to genuinely like them, even as the nefarious plot behind the town's quiet unfolds in a series of gristly murders. So Nicholas, who is so good at police work he rarely has ever needed to use guns, and Danny, who has always wanted to use guns but never had the chance, get to take on a cast of most unlikely villains in a classic shootout that is both exciting and comical.

""Hot Fuzz"" makes homage to its sources, the ultra-violent cop films of the last twenty years, even as it lampoons them. This is a top-notch film.",1265328000,,1091,4.422885572139304

2660314,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I will admit that at times I go a little overboard when reviewing these `spoof' comedies.  I walk away from the movie thinking one thing and then, in the middle of writing my review, I change my mind.  The fact remains that these movies need time to settle.  The comedy in these films may not seem blatant and `laugh out loud' funny on the outset, but remembering the scenes can be more rewarding then actually seeing them.

Case in point; `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is one of my favorite comedies.  When I first saw the film I hated it.  It wasn't until a conversation I had a few YEARS later with some friends that I realized just how funny that movie really is.  Another film that strikes me as funnier when `thinking' about it is `Scary Movie 2'.  The difference there is that, when watching the film a second and third time, it becomes apparent that the film should only be thought about, never seen.

So, it's safe to say then that, when reflecting on these films and writing my reviews my initial reaction can, at times, get thwarted by my newfound appreciation for what I had previously witnessed.  This has caused my views to get clouded at times (thus resulting in 5-star reviews for films like `Slither', that, upon further reflection should have remained the B-Grade movie I had initially intended it to be), not always for the better.

I loved this movie from the start, in through the middle, and in the end as well.  Upon further reflection I still love it, and yet I see its faults and am forcing myself to keep with my initial grade (B+) and fight the urge to give it an A.

Ha, now that I've said all of that (sorry), I can get to my review.

`Hot Fuzz' pairs Simon Pegg and Nick Frost up with their `Shaun of the Dead' director Edgar Wright.  This time Pegg is playing Nicholas Angel, an overzealous police officer who has made it a habit of making everyone around him look bad, so much so that he is promoted only to find himself relocated to the country where the crime rate is low and the villagers are, well, interesting.  Angel is furious but he quickly adapts and starts enforcing the law, to the dismay of those around him (especially the lazy police force).  His partner, Danny Butterman, dreams of living out an action movie, and once citizens start dieing, he finally gets his chance.

`Hot Fuzz' is obvious, but it is supposed to be.  You kind of know who to suspect the minute you see him, but it's okay because you expect that.  The film moves along a little slowly in parts, but it makes up for that with clever (albeit stagy) dialog and performances (Pegg slips into David Caruso mode effortlessly).  The film is kind of cut like a slick horror film, or an upstaged episode of CSI, with quick editing and glossy visuals.  The gore is very present, but always in a comical and `airy' kind of way.  It doesn't feel gory because it is there for you to laugh at.  The ending is the films best feature and greatest detractor.  It layers it on thick (the action scenes are gloriously shot and surprisingly charismatic and funny) and that is a good thing and, eventually, a bad thing (it doesn't know when to quit).

Despite that twist upon a twist upon a twist upon a twist, it still comes together very nicely in the end and certainly warrants our attention.

I was one who strongly disliked `Shaun of the Dead' upon my initial viewing, found it slightly humorous upon reflection only to watch it again and conclude that, while it has its moments (that record tossing scene is just glorious) it remains overrated in my opinion.  `Hot Fuzz' blows that one out of the water, and quite frankly, if it had toned down the end a tad (even in its longevity it does maintain its comedic timing though...that swan!) I would have given it an A, without any hesitation.

I don't want to seem overzealous here, so I'm restraining myself (my inner movie-lover is aching to give this an extra star now!).  See what I mean?  I started this review determined to go the way of a B+ and I've already talked myself into an A-.  No, no I must stick to my guns here.

B+, x's 1000!",1260230400,,4096,4.4404283801874165
2660315,2,B000IOM9VQ,"This 2007 British movie totally confused me.  It starts out slow and sets up a situation that is supposed to be funny.  Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the star.  He acts and looks like the latest James Bond actor, a combination of Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood.  Nicolas Angel is an over-achiever cop in London.  His fellow cops are embarrassed by his perfection as it makes them look bad.  His arrest record is 400% higher than any of them.  He makes them all look bad, like they are not trying to do their jobs.  Angel's supervisors send him to a small remote village outside of London.  The name of the town is Sandford and Angel starts out doing trite and routine police work.  The feel of the movie is that it is a dry comedy, but you begin to wonder as Angel's crime sensing skills keep jolting you.  At first it is small crimes.

He becomes partners with Danny (Nick Frost), the son of the the Police Chief, Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  Danny is a wanna-be gunfighter, action-oriented guy, and becomes fast friends with Angel.

The story unravels from being fairly pleasant and tongue-in-cheek funny to a horrifying realization that practically the whole town is involved with murders, violence and sociopathic behaviors.  The blood and guts is not that funny and shocked and gagged me.  Many killings that were set up to look accidental were really murders planned by the town's ""Better Good"" shadow committee.

As the mystery deepens, and grisly deaths continue through scene after scene, Angel and Nick work together to clean up the town - it morphs into a Western of sorts when Angel rides into town on a horse with enough guns to kill a platoon.  Some of the dark comedy gave me a laugh, but the last part of the movie dragged on and on, as one fight after another erupts, deaths mount and everyone that can double-cross another has had their scene.  It is supposed to be surprising but it only made me look at my watch - when is this overwrought fairy-tale hero going to win and move on?  He finally does, the town settles down, and it is a relief.

If you like a lot of gun-totting frumpy villagers, car chases, bombs, back-stabbing, and grisly scenes this is for you.",1259971200,2,2190,4.592783505154639

2660355,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Ah, genius. Some people have it, some don't.

Edward Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost should just make movies together. Pegg, don't bother with 'Star Trek,' you're funnier when you get to be rated R. Guys, stop participating in quasi-heartwarming films like 'Run Fatboy Run.' Just keep doing your Blood and Ice Cream films and we'll all be happy.

I'm a giant fan of 'Shaun of the Dead,' of course, as any self-respecting zombie lover should be. While 'Hot Fuzz' is a bit more polished across the board than 'Shaun', and maybe some of that production value is what turned people off, clearly the look and style of the film was more posh because that's part of the joke. Overly-saturated big action films are what's being satirized here.

The genius of this comedy lies in the clever, controlled handling of all the elements. Making fun of stupid cop movies? Check. Constant visual and auditory referencing of previous collaborations AND other films? Check. Charming character development and genuine emotion? Check. Do I hoot my way through this movie every time I see it as much as I did the first time I saw it? Yes, I do.

I'm writing this review because I also think this DVD is pretty nicely put-together. I'm not usually a fan of long, complicated DVD menus, mainly because it slows everything down and you can't just forward through to starting the film, but this menu is both well-executed and worth sitting through. Also, there are some brilliant extras, including a Sean Connery bit and a truly fine gag reel. Often the gag reel is really only funny to the people who worked on the film - kind of a 'you had to be there' thing that somehow the filmmakers think other people will get - but when you get comedy skillz like these gents have, you get ACTUAL funny.

2660356,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz (Edgar Wright, 2007)

I expected to like Hot Fuzz, the second feature by the same comedy team (Wright, Pegg, and Frost) who brought us Shaun of the Dead in 2004. What I didn't expect was that under the comedy, which we assumed we'd get from these very funny guys, would actually be a cracking mystery that would hold my interest just as much as Pegg and Frost's banter.

Plot: Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a cop's cop, the kind of guy who can make a mugger put down the purse and back away just by cocking an eyebrow. Problem is, he's making the rest of his department look bad, so they conspire to get him sent to Sandford, a quiet town in the country well-known for its low crime rate. He gets off to a great start when he gets there by finding one of the town's rare crimes; he's not even on the force yet, but he ends up hauling in a guy for drunk driving. Of course, the next morning, he finds out that the guy he hauled in is his new partner, Danny Butterman (Frost). Sandford's police force is very laid-back; why shouldn't they be? After all, the town has almost no crime. That doesn't sit well with Angel's type A personality, of course, so he starts looking around to see if there's anything the lackluster bobbies around him have simply been overlooking. With Danny as his reluctant accomplice, Angel starts investigating a series of accidents he finds suspicious. Together, the two of them get closer and closer to what's looking like a major conspiracy. Their challenge then becomes figuring out who's behind the conspiracy before those unknowns can stop their investigation permanently.

Put Pegg, Wright, and Frost together and you're basically guaranteed a good time. Shaun of the Dead was a brilliant send-up of zombie films, but really, when it came right down to it, it was a straight comedy, albeit one that was fantastically made. Hot Fuzz, while just as hysterical as Shaun, is not a straight comedy at all, and shows the versatility of Wright as a director, Frost and Pegg as actors, and all three of them as co-writers. Sure, you come for the comedy, and the movie delivers as expected on that front, but this is a whodunit that's got some teeth as well, and what a pleasant surprise that is. A definite recommendation, even for those who, for whatever reason, didn't like Shaun. ****",1243814400,,2313,4.582125603864735

2660388,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This is definitely the funniest comedy of 2007. Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost make a great trio. With their knowledge of action movies deemed both good and bad, they make a motion picture that's filled with high-octane action, impressive suspense, magnificent slapstick humor, and tons of blood and guts. It may be a bit too long for some (two hours can be too much for a comedy), but I didn't find any tedium anywhere in the film. Mostly it's because I was too immersed in the characters and the comedy. Speaking of characters, Nicholas Angel (Pegg) and Danny Butterman (Frost) has to be one of the most popular duos of this generation. Like in Shaun of the Dead, they sure know how to be loved by those who're into action, suspense, and comedy. Timothy Dalton, along with the rest of the supporting comedic ensemble, makes this even more memorable. And David Arnold's score really something worth mentioning: the synthesizers along with the orchestra is a perfect combination for this sort of movie.

If you love Shaun of the Dead and the Spaced TV series, then you'll probably get a kick out of Hot Fuzz if you're into mindless action and smart comedy.",1243468800,,1166,4.715686274509804
2660389,5,B000IOM9VQ,"""Hot Fuzz"" is one of the greatest satires of all time. It's heartwarming, charming, outrageous and super memorable. If you've seen ""Shaun of the Dead"" expect the same smorgasbord of genres here. There's a little parody, a little ""British TV"" comedy, a little drama, a little mystery, a little horror... It's all here! I can honestly call this one of my favorite films.

A CAUTION
There are a few comments in this film that I felt were incredibly misplaced. First off the use of the ""c"" word towards the middle of the film was uncalled for and somewhat that I believe will shock most american viewers. Not tasteful...

Secondly, there are some extremely off color ""double entendres"" by the female cop that are just flat out gross. These moments are so scarce, you barely remember them when the film ends, but they're always annoying and most uncalled for.

Thirdly, the film is extremely violent... Gushing blood and decapitation are played up for laughs (and I didn't find this element offensive) but if you are squeemish, I wouldn't recommend it.

BOTTOM LINE:
Awesome movie! I really can't recommend this one enough to viewers willing to ignore a few bumps in the road.",1242000000,,1171,4.810945273631841

2660391,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Well, there is no actual romance in this movie - but there's almost everything else. There is good spoofing humor, an endearing buddy/sidekick relationship, some examples of astute crime detection, some grisly murders, a number of slam-bam car chases, and an over-the-top shoot-out.

The shoot-out perhaps lasts a little too long, but it is inventively choreographed, so it will probably appeal even to those who generally prefer subdued, drawing room dramas. At the center of all this merry mayhem is a straight-arrow model of a modern police officer - played with super-hero stalwartness by Simon Pegg. He's a throwback to the old cowboy heroes in the movie/TV serials of the 1950's. And what a relief! He has no baggage, no ""humanizing"" flaws. He is not a recovering alcoholic; although he is divorced, he is not shown agonizing over parental failures; he's not a womanizer or a sadist.

It's not that this is a dully PG film. Some pretty rough language swirls through the action, and there is a fair amount of blood spatter. In spite of this though, ""Hot Fuzz"" ends up being a feel-good, rejoice of a film.

It also surprises audiences with cameo or supporting performances by some established British actors who haven't been seen much in films lately and about whom you just might have been wondering, ""Where are they now?"" For example, there's Billie Whitelaw. She's tackled some gritty roles in British films, starting in the 1950's. But I most remember her from hilarious romps such as ""Make Mine Mink"" with Terry-Thomas. She does a wonderful turn here - simply working a crossword puzzle. Then look for Edward Woodward of ""Breaker Morant,"" ""Wicker Man,"" and TV's ""The Equalizer"" fame.

There's no Director's Commentary on this disc, but there is a ""trivia"" subtitle option. By clicking on this accompaniment, you can learn how a lot of the characters' names and place names are homages to characters and settings in other, often obscure, but hip films. One not-so-obscure film that is often echoed in this way is ""Straw Dogs."" A lot of these details really are trivial, but if you enjoy the kind of spoofing inherent in subtle cross-referencing and self-referencing - knowing that the film is rife with these will add to your enjoyment and will keep you on your toes trying to detect them. It will turn you into a name spotter.",1235865600,,2336,4.891414141414141

When I saw it in theaters, it was me and one friend, and we pretty much didn't stop laughing the entire time. If you don't like British humor, you'll still probably find some parts of it you enjoy, but if you do, it's really just non stop fantastic.

On the other, not too often do I laugh out loud at a movie several times, including at scenes where the joke is telegraphed well in advance (fascist............. hag!).

Angel arrives in sleepy Sanford, he is absolutely appalled - the very first night he rounds up ""most the town, there"" as underage drinkers, a drunk-driver and other petty behaviour occurs around him, and he tramps them all into jail.  Heralding his own arrival in this manner does not necessarily grant him an easy entrance into the camaraderie that the rest of the force share, especially ""the Andies"" (played by Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall), who constantly twit him and smart off to him and generally make his life miserable (and do those guys REALLY talk like that, or were they just making a silly voice for this movie?).  The drunk driver (Nick Frost), yclept Danny, turns out to be the son of the Inspector (Jim Broadbent), and, of course, Danny wants to be just like this ""big city"" policeman.  For Danny, watching buddy-cop movies is his passion and pass-time, so he has somewhat skewed perceptions of the reality of police work in the ""big city.""

However, shortly after Angel arrives, bodies start to show up.  It certainly appears they are accidental deaths, but Angel - being the suspicious sort - isn't very trusting, especially when it comes to that sort of thing - and begins to get suspicious.  His suspicions are especially aroused by the owner of the local supermarket (Tim Dalton), who is always wandering around making creepy small talk to people; for instance ""Why, I bet if we took your head off, we'd find all kinds of interesting things inside ...""  He becomes even more suspicious as the ""accidents"" become more and more unlikely.  Finally, he discovers that things in the sleepy 'burg of Sanford are not at all as they seem ... but is it too late for him?

An absolutely wonderful movie, lots of wonderfully dry British humour - the sort of thing you have to just sit back and goggle over, it's so wonderful.  The scene with the woman who owns the nursery is so wonderfully funny that I have to wonder how many takes it took to get it right, because she and/or Pegg had to have been cracking up every few sentences, with so many ""God rest him/her/thems"" scattered throughout it.  A fun game to play (no fair looking at IMDB to find the answers!) is ""Spot the uncredited, hidden celebrity in the extras!""  Can YOU find Cate Blanchett?  Peter Jackson?  Steve Coogans?  Peter Wild?  Garth Jennings?  etc. ...

So ... get this movie.  Watch it repeatedly until you can quote it at length in your sleep.  Love it like your child.

2660415,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz  After Shaun of the Dead, the writer/director/actor trio of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost came up with this new comedy that does for cop movies what Shaun did for zombie flicks. As before Wright directs a script written by himself and Pegg, and Pegg and Frost star. Pegg plays Nick Angel, a London cop so dedicated and efficient he starts to skew the statistics away from his less motivated colleagues. He soon finds himself transferred to Sandford, a tiny little rural village on the books with the lowest crime rate in England. Angel is understandably miffed by this, especially when partnered with the local police chief's son (Frost), who's a likable lunkhead. Shortly after his arrival, though, gruesome deaths start occurring. Angel is sure it's murder, but everyone else in town thinks the deaths are accidental. Angel becomes determined to solve the crimes no matter how many toes he must step on. This very funny movie manages to walk a very fine line: it spoofs American action movies hilariously but never stops being British. It does, however, come by its R rating very honestly, with rampant profanity and some very gory murders. The violence is as over the top as it was in Shaun of the Dead, but with that same matter of fact/deadpan tone that pushes it past icky into icky-but-funny. (kind of like the gore in a Monty Python movie) And what a cast the boys have in support this time: Timothy Dalton (2 time 007), Edward Woodward (The Wicker Man-1973), a couple of unidentifiable but hilarious celebrity cameos, and briefly, Martin Freeman (The Office-British version).

Angel becomes suspicious as the accident mortality rate in the village begins to rise, only to be held back by the cluelessness of his colleagues and bizarreness of the locals.

The support cast is allstar, if you're British, and must have been a director's dream. At times the film almost had a Wallace and Gromit feel to it, and you can tell it was made with with a lot of affection. Jim Broadbent must be fast approaching the 'national treasure' level, as Sgt. Frank Butterman, stalwart of the Police station and  village.

2660418,5,B000IOM9VQ,"When we watched Hot Fuzz, we laughed our patooties off!

The movie tells the story of police officer Nicholas Angel, a top cop in London. Because he's received so many commendations and made so many arrests (400% more than any other officer in London), he's making his co-workers (and supervisors) look bad. To get rid of him, management has him transferred to the sleepy little village of Sandford. There, he gets stuck with an inexperienced partner (who happens to be the son of the police inspector) and finds difficulty making the transition from lean, mean, policing machine to do-nothing keeper of a town where very little crime is ever committed.

But then, odd things begin to happen. A philandering couple is found beheaded on a local highway. A man is blown up after a gas leak in his house. A reporter from the town's newspaper is killed by a piece of falling stone from an old church roof. Local authorities insist that all of these deaths are just accidents, but Nicholas begins to think there's more to it than that.

For the rest of the movie, Nicholas and his bumbling partner try to unearth the thread that links all the murders. The truth behind the rash of deaths is comic gold.

This movie is a hilarious send-up of the cop genre, but it's also a decent action flick in its own right. Pegg is marvelous as the orderly, buttoned-up Nicholas, and Nick Frost holds down his side of the script as the naive Danny Butterman (Nick's partner). There were knee-slapping lines and situations throughout, with character-driven comedy playing just as large a role as all the funny plot-driven stuff.

You will recognize several other cast members as well: Bill Nighy as the Met Chief Inspector, Jim Broadbent as Inspector Frank Butterman, Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner, even a tiny role by Cate Blanchett, who plays Nicholas' former girlfriend.

Anywho, Hot Fuzz starts off somewhat normal but then halfway through the film, it gets a tad weird. What you think the plot is about is not what it really is, and it just comes at you all of a sudden from a million different directions. It's just weird. Oh, and the excess of blood and gore is also a cool and unexpected treat.

But it is also funny, for the most part. The gags are funny, the characters are even funnier and the film is stylised in the same vein of Shaun of the Dead, which is by far funnier than this. They even reused a few of the same actors. You gotta love the little cameo with Bill Nighy, that guy is just fabulous.  Nick Frost is also a great funny sidekick.

Much like Shaun of the Dead, this movie is a pure bred cult classic.  With the same perfect balance of humor and gore, they got it right one more time.

Officer Angel (aka Officer Angle) and his gang of rural cops go from one suspected murder to the next in sheer and utter blindness about what the truth of the situation is until the very end.  It'll have you splitting at the seams from laughter, and on the edge of your seat from the suspense.

You know the tired old cliche in those Hollywood cop movies, one of the cops is divorced, married to the job, and it's just so melodramatic-stupid.  Well in this spoof, the protagonist plays that part more like a gung-ho workoholic, the kind we're more likely to find in real life, which is much funnier.  You also know how thinly two dimensional and predictable the bad guys are in American mainstream cop movies, well the ridiculous twist here is that the bad guys are quaint English villager types, it's an absurd twist that had me grinning when I wasn't laughing out loud.

2660496,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (director and co-writers) nailed the zombie spoof with the uber-witty ""Shaun of the Dead.""  Re-assembling much of the same cast and keeping the understated yet hilarious send-up theme, they turn their sights to action flicks of the Jerry Bruckheimer/Tony Scott variety with ""Hot Fuzz.""  And the results couldn't be better.

Nicholas Angel (Pegg, the lead from ""Shaun) is the top kick-butt sergeant in the London police force.  This is in itself high comedy, because Pegg only resembles an action hero the way Rudy represents a Notre Dame football player - I half expected someone to remind Angel that he's five-foot-nothin' and a hundred-and-nothin', with a weak chin to boot.  His success only earns him the enmity of his fellow cops (including the hilarious Bill Nighy) who reassign him to the country to keep them from looking bad.

Once there, Angel finds a police force who couldn't assemble a two-car parade and haven't been asked to do much more than that.  Eventually, though, Angel stumbles upon a massive criminal enterprise and brings it down with the help of not-so-trusty sidekick Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, also the fat sidekick in ""Shaun"").

Like ""Shaun,"" ""Hot Fuzz"" has the usual combination of subtle and not-so-subtle humor wrapped around some shocking-yet-comical violence.  A larger budget means that explosions are bigger and deaths are bloodier and more elaborate, but at its heart ""Hot Fuzz"" remains an ingenious comedy more than an action movie.  While the movie stands on its own rights, it means a heck of a lot more if you've sat through more than your share of ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Bad Boyz"" flicks - these guys feel your pain, too.",1207440000,,1689,5.0

Simon Pegg is the stud, and Nick Frost is the (apparent) dud, and as expected they both mature, learn a bit on the way, and become friends as they solve the mystery and take the bad guys down, down to downtown, baby.

There's quite a bit of British English slang throughout the film, so pay attention.  It's not nearly as challenging to decipher as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ali-G-Indahouse/dp/B0002ZMITY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ali G Indahouse</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trainspotting/dp/B0001XALTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trainspotting</a>, but if you're not listening you're not going to get it.  This is especially true when they're interacting with the locals, and with the crew at the precinct, while not as quite as wacky as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reno-911/dp/B0001XAODE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reno 911</a>, still a great bunch of interesting and funny supporting characters.

The story is as predictable as can be, but still fun.  It was clear from the very beginning who the bad guys were, and where the film was headed, and it just seemed to me to take a little bit too long to get there.  The big shootout and chase at the end were great, but left me feeling a bit disappointed (more below).

The violence:  This film was positively schizophrenic when it came to its violence.  Given&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B000R8YC3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>, I expected at least the same level of violence, but this time with a lot more guns.  The deaths of the hapless murder victims were as bloody as you can get, progressively so, more graphic that Shaun of the Dead, but not quite to the masturbatory excess of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grindhouse-Presents-Planet-Terror/dp/B000UAE7O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror</a>.  The one scene where the cathedral stone falls on the reporter is so over-the-top bloody it's absolutely hilarious, but as comical as it is, it's still quite graphic.  And when it finally comes time for payback with the murderers--and we know that they deserve it--there is almost no blood whatsoever.  Pegg and Frost blast away at the bad guys with a cop-movie-appropriate arsenal, but nobody gets blown away; there is no&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarface/dp/B000GGSMB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarface</a>&nbsp;bullet-dance, no bloodbag squibs going off in glorious succession.  It's as hokey as the Lone Ranger winging the bad guy with a single shot to the wrist so he'll drop the gun and be all docile and recalcitrant for his ride back to town.  It's a very strange dichotomy; all of the innocent victims are not-coming-back dead, while none, not a single one of the murderers ends up that way.  Yeah, I know Pegg's character is the good guy and won't kill unless he's forced to, but come on.

You could argue that this film has been softened up from the relative honesty--Shaun having to kill his zombie-mom--of Shaun of the Dead.  That's what happens when you're aiming for a wider market; you start worrying about demographics who could be turned off or otherwise offended by your content.  It's not a sellout, not quite, but it seems to be trending in that direction.

The shoot `em up was okay, but the entire cast could have done a few more days worth of intensive practice with their weapons.  You can tell England has a ban on firearms, the way both the men and the women were carrying and employing their weapons, even the cops.

I really enjoyed the office scene in which Pegg is sent off to Boring-Upon-Stoat, with each succeeding superior--Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy--stepping in as anticipated, planned and rehearsed to tell Pegg to shove off.  That's some serious British comic horsepower interacting there, and the gag reel shows just how good it was.

The DVD extras were pretty good.  The deleted scenes were surprisingly good, not the typically dry, boring and terrible stuff that you get.  The goofs and gags were excellent, really funny, delightfully vulgar, and went on for a good long time--this is the way a gag reel should be done.  And keep your eyes peeled for the Cate Blanchett and Peter Jackson cameos.

Bottom line:  This is not Shaun of the Dead with a change of wardrobe.  While the buddy aspect is still there between Pegg and Frost, its development is different, and arguably better done.  The story is predictable from the outset, but that does not lessen the laughs one bit.  It's a fun and easy story, told well and very comically, with some highly cheesy gore to spice things up, and a satisfying blowout at the finish.",1205107200,,5581,6.291721419185283

2660534,4,B000IOM9VQ,"British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves.  HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.

Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is one of London's finest new policemen, expecting a smart career in the big city, but instead is transferred by jealous superiors (including Bill Nighy) to a little village where his rigorous training seems wasted on the sleepy town.  After a first night's arrest of youthful pubsters and an inebriate driver, he reports to duty to discover the that his first 'arrest' is to be his partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who just happens to be the slow son of the chief, Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent). The staff at the police station resembles a vaudeville team played by such fine actors as Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Timothy Dalton etc, not exactly what Angel had in mind as a career advancing  opportunity.  But soon enough the threads of evil that are beneath the silly facade of the village begin to unravel and what follows is a hilarious, almost Keystone Cop attack on the loonies in this take off of an Agatha Christie plot that curdled.

And that only touches the surface of this witty little farce: the innuendoes pop up out of every situation, giving the astute viewer quiet chuckles throughout the film.  Hidden from obvious view are little vignettes by such luminaries as Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, and Peter Jackson! Director Edgar Wright, who wrote the script with Simon Pegg, knows his way around the genre and the result is an hysterically funny evening's entertainment.

Too much freedom, it seems. I often found myself wondering what kind of movie Hot Fuzz wanted to be and I am not sure Wright and Pegg knew themselves. Even the most talented writers and directors need some critical feedback while practicing their craft. It just appears they didn't get it.

Hot Fuzz throws in nearly plot and storyline imaginable in a two hour film that could have easily been cut by 30 minutes. The Scream-like killer becomes a very odd detour that drains comedy out of the movie and the predictable plot twists never transform into the genre bending genius of Shaun of the Dead.

He's the best at everything he does and in just a few years on the force has achieved more than the rest of the department put together.  He's an excellent officer, but is so good that he's making everyone around him look bad.  He's given a promotion that virtually exiles him to the sleepy, dreamy village of Sandford.  He's assigned Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) as his partner, a junior officer and son of the local police chief, Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  Everything appears to be quiet in the small village until a couple of local actors are found decapitated.  Their deaths are ruled an accident, but Angel thinks there's something more going and soon discovers that the residents of the sleepy little village are hiding a dark secret.

HOT FUZZ begins like a typical comical mystery movie.  There are some elements that are purposely overdone for comic effect, but the film still retains an aura of mystery and suspense.  That is until the last twenty-minutes of the movie. That's when the action-factor of the film kicks into high gear as well as humor meter.  When I saw HOT FUZZ for the first time, I was laughing so hard during the last part of the movie that there were a few times I had a hard time breathing.

It's as if the writers had an idea for a short film of 30 minutes and stretched it out another additional hour. I'm sorry for being a naysayer, but even if a movie's main premise is slightly different than the norm, a good film still needs to deliver a whole lot more, and Hot Fuzz simply doesn't.

No, it's not as good as Shaun of the Dead, but it's not really a disappointment either even if the laugh count is a lot lower. Much of the film really isn't that funny, yet it gets by for much of its running time on sheer enthusiastic likeability. At times Edgar Wright's direction tries a little too hard and few of the many cameos have much to do (though a heavily disguised Cate Banchett makes a real virtue of her anonymity and Peter Jackson does turn up as a psycho Santa), but it's one of the very few films where the fun that the filmmakers seem to be having actually seems to translate to the finished product. As with Shaun, it's an inspired bit of gene-splicing, in this case a wonderful yet surprisingly logical cross between Agatha Christie and Jerry Bruckheimer, with a series of very English crimes - motivated by nothing so sordid as monetary gain or as logical as a criminal conspiracy but rather by something infinitely more respectable - culminating in 20 minutes of virtuoso mayhem that sees Simon Pegg and Nick Frost shooting up the kind of quaint and picturesque village more used to the genteel Sunday teatime likes of The Vicar of Dibley and All Creatures Great and Small. Even the casting of the local Neighbourhood Watch is truly inspired, consisting of (among others), James Bond (Timothy Dalton, whose `supermarket slasher' gets my vote for Best Supporting Actor this year), Callan (Edward Woodward), Bellocq from Raiders of the Lost Ark (Paul Freeman), the nanny from The Omen (Billie Whitelaw) and the villain from Lethal Weapon 3 (Stuart Wilson). And there's been some real thought put into the disposal of the bad guys, which mirror the various murders in gruesomely exaggerated fashion via bear traps, model villages and sea mines. Very pleasing indeed - even the extras on the DVD are unusually entertaining. Yarrp.",1202860800,5,1905,4.793313069908814

Especially the goofy, head-scratching ending. My one-word review for this film: Moronic.",1202428800,,377,5.3

I'm not one who will usually watch a movie multiple times in a short time period, however, with this movie, I made an exception and I liked it much better the second time.

Comedy, action, horror, suspense, and even a bit of drama. I mean, this movie has it all! I was a big fan of ""Shaun of the Dead"", so when I saw this movie coming out, I HAD to go see it. I saw this movie in the theaters, and it was worth every cent. If you like great movies, you'll LOVE this one!! A must see!!",1201478400,,446,3.705263157894737

I was not shocked that I laughed as much as I did but I was pleasantly surprised that my girlfriend enjoyed the movie as well.  She primarily watches movies of 1 or 2 star fame in addition to films that are considered classics such as Casablanca.  That being said, this film caters to a greater audience and has the capacity to be entertaining to everyone.  It is wholesome in that it has a great plot with the perfect combinations of twists and turns.

Judged in comparison to the standard-def DVD, the video and audio packages are both significantly improved, and this HD DVD even includes ten hours of features that aren't even available on the US-released DVD.

Simply put, in my opinion, this is currently the best overall high-def release on the market -- especially when you factor in the price. Purchasing 'Hot Fuzz' on HD DVD is a no-brainer for fans and an easy recommendation for newcomers. This is what high definition is all about.",1200355200,,696,5.205357142857143

Its clever and relevant and the twists will surprise you.  Its wonderfully well cast (the creators are also the stars, but they are excellent in those roles).  The script is funny and there are some great quotables (for those who like that sort of thing).

My boyfriend and I saw a lot of movies in 2007 and we both think this was one of the best.  It doesn't have any sweeping period romance or dramatic scenes, so you may not see it on the award nominations but I would feel confident that just about anyone familiar with popular culture (specifically regarding action/cop flicks) over the last 10 years or so will love it.",1199404800,,822,4.489932885906041

It has 5 commentaries on the movie, as well as a copy of on of Edgar Wright's AmDram movie, ""Dead Right,"" which has two commentaries on it as well.

The discs are all loaded with fun little stuff that we've come to expect from producer Nira Parks and her crack team of players. Pegg and Wright's writing skills are at their best, and Pegg and Frost would carry the movie on with their acting, but every side character steals the show at some point. Just when you think they are going to be the best, someone else comes up and slaps you in the face with awesome.

The movie has an all-star cast (from the UK anyway), and is simply one of the most fun movies I've seen since... well... Since Shaun of the Dead.

While he's there he discovers an organization of murderers and tries to stop them.  This is a funny movie because the blood is extremely exagerated and the reasons the murderers kill for are so stupid it's hard not to laugh.  Even thought this movie is great the murder scenes are a little distrubing.  For example at one part a giant stone spike is pushed off the top of a building and it lands in someone's head.  At this point blood is spraying and gushing out all over the place.  It was funny yet absolutely disgusting.  Don't let this one scene ruin it for you though.

2660592,4,B000IOM9VQ,I loved Shaun of the Dead and this one is just as good! A definate classic of dry British humour. Have watched it several times now and still not bored of it.,1198454400,,158,3.96875
2660593,3,B000IOM9VQ,"A policeman strides down a precinct corridor. He's got the steely glare of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry, the square-jaw intensity of Bruce Willis's John McClane and the maverick streak of Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs. We've seen enough blockbusters that even before our hero's name is uttered--they call him ... Nicholas Angel!--we know we're dealing with a law-enforcement lone wolf. Angel is the most dedicated member of London's Metropolitan Police. In fact, with an arrest rate ""400 percent higher"" than the rest of his department, he's making everybody else look bad, which is why this supercop just got shuffled off to a quaint English village where a high-speed pursuit means chasing a runaway pet swan.

Welcome to Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz, which aims to do for high-octane action movies what his parodic masterpiece Shaun of the Dead did for zombie flicks. The setup is so simple even a studio executive would get it: Angel (Shaun star and cowriter Simon Pegg, who also shares writing duties here) is stuck in a town full of rural stereotypes (a kindly clergyman, cheery innkeepers) and saddled with a dim-bulb constable (Nick Frost) for a sidekick. Then a lot of mysterious ""accidents"" start occurring, and our hero smells a murder spree. (Things end up not being what they seem.) Oversize and extremely phallic guns are drawn. Things go boom. And, amid all the laughter, '80s he-man cinema gets slowly roasted over a spit.

Any half-wit can parody a genre or two--or a dozen; just ask the cretins behind cut-rate gagfests like Epic Movie. But what makes Wright & Co.'s buddy-cop goof so spot-on is that, like their previous take on splatter flicks, the pair share an affection for--and thorough knowledge of--cineplex cheese with their film-geek fan base. It's one thing to give the local homicide detective an outrageously bushy mustache (though, to be fair, actor Paddy Considine's upper-lip shrubbery deserves some sort of tonsorial award); it's another thing entirely to treat flash-cut montages of doors being opened and pub pints being pulled as if they were action sequences, or to turn a supermarket siege into a spot-on homage to John Woo's bullet ballets. The fact that all of this Sturm und Drang is taking place in a picturesque hamlet only makes the inherent silliness of law-and-order summer-movie spectacles more apparent.

And yet, because Wright and Pegg still harbor a soft spot for Riggs and Murtaugh et al, they take the piss out of them without being condescending. The sheer glee with which they present these high-testosterone misadventures seems to say that yes, guys jumping over car hoods while firing two Glocks at once is so over the top that you can't take it seriously. But we still get a huge rush watching.

Those viewers who prefer their testosterone in kinder, gentler doses may want to check out Diggers, a pleasant-enough indie about immature dudes belatedly coming of age. In this case, it's a bunch of Long Island clam fishermen figuring things out in the mid-'70s (which means plentiful sideburns). But the character types are essentially timeless: There's the go-with-the-flow guy (Paul Rudd), who gets an existential wakeup call when his pop dies; the local Lothario (Ron Eldard); the stoner philosopher (Josh Hamilton); and the blue-collar a-hole (The State's Ken Marino). Various women, naturally, orbit these overgrown boys of summer as they stand around and talk. And talk. And talk. Director Katherine Dieckmann keeps everything moving smoothly, and the appeal of Rudd in wisecracking mode can't be underestimated. But if you've ever sat through an Ed Burns film, there's nothing here you haven't seen before.

That's something that certainly can't be said for Zoo, a documentary about a Seattle resident who in the summer of 2005 went to see a man about a horse. He ended up bleeding to death in an emergency room several hours later from a perforated colon, and filmmaker Robinson Devor (Police Beat) traces the link between the two events. Yes, unfortunately, it's exactly what you think--the victim was visiting a farm that catered to hot man-on-stallion action. A former crime reporter, Devor is skilled at getting people involved in the underground ""zoophile"" community to open up about their unusual lifestyle. What's most surprising, however, is how he's able to make a film about such a sensationalistic subject and have it be neither unbearably sleazy nor cringe-inducing. Thanks to the dreamlike cinematography and ambient soundtrack, the movie feels like a lyrical meditation on twisted desires (though it doesn't condone them). As good as it is, this is one movie you hope to God never gets a sequel.",1198281600,,4666,5.102094240837697

It is funny (with a lot of that subtle British humor that we all love) but what I really loved about it was the character development, the attention to detail, and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat but can also be the source of a deep after-movie discussion (if you do that sort of thing...)

Pegg was absolutely wonderful in portraying his character and, of course, complements what's his face very well.  The story is written very cleverly, it actually has a couple points to make, and is down-to-earth entertaining. A couple images are not suitable for children or people who are eating food that doesn't sit well anyways.

2660663,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of SHAUN OF THE DEAD are back in this film of a spoof of a buddy cop blockbuster. Simon Pegg plays a London police officer that is so good at his job that he is forced to transfer to an assignment in the country in order to no longer make the rest of the officers in London look incompetent. Once in the country he is paired off with Nick Frost who plays a sad sack of the little village's police force who only has his job because his father is the chief of police.

For a spoof this is a well-produced action adventure film. They have made good use of their bigger budget and this films R-rating comes from strong language. Even so this is fun to watch as the action picks up in the small and idyllic village of Sandford. A series of murders start Pegg's character investigating them though all others in the village believe they are just a series of accidents.

There are many clichs and homage's to other films, they are so numerous I could not possible list them. You will also see and hear references to their previous movie, SHAUN OF THE DEAD.

One of my favourite British actors from any era Jim Broadbent. Simon Pegg who has an intensity in his acting that is very funny. Bill Bailey, Nick Frost, Timothy Dalton etc etc, but somehow it just doesn't work.

The idea behind the story has the makings of a successful comedy. Sgt Angel is sent to Sandford, a small sleepy English town, because he is too good. As Angel Simon Pegg is perfect for the role but is let down most of the time by lines that just aren't that funny. To be honest after an hour had passed I had started to lose interest and at an hour and a half I gave up. It is too long.

Maybe on a 2nd showing I will enjoy it more, but its not a film I'd recommend anybody buying just because they liked 'Shaun of the Dead'. rent it first.",1193961600,4,910,4.135593220338983

2660695,2,B000IOM9VQ,"I thought this was a pretty lousy comedy and that is coming from someone who did enjoy ""Shaun of the Dead"" - and if you're about to tell me that this movie isn't the same as that one, well you got that right buster.  ""Hot Fuzz"" is almost like attending a boring work seminar compared the party of ""Shaun of the Dead"".

Maybe I'm not the target audience because I either didn't see many of the action/cop movies that ""Hot Fuzz"" references - and in most cases that I did see one, I don't remember it well enough.  Those movies are fun to watch because they are over the top and everything, but I don't see much point in making a movie that constantly references them.  I'd rather go back and re-watch movies like ""Point Blank"" or the Lethal Weapon series than watch another movie who's jokes depend on how well you have those earlier movies memorized.  I don't - and if the same goes for you, I say avoid this one.

And oh yeah, how could I almost forget to mention - there is no reason for this movie to be two hours long, it seems to go on and on forever.  There are at least three separate climaxes, each one feeling like the movie is mercifully coming to an end.  What's the point in spoofing something if in the process you end up becoming just like your subject of ridicule?",1193097600,4,1278,4.25206611570248
2660696,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I resisted watching this movie. I just assumed it would be an idiotic waste of time. I was so very wrong!

This movie is about a relentless and highly successful London Police Officer (Nicholas Angel). He has a high arrest record and the other London Police say that ""you're making us look bad."" So they transfer him up to a sleepy, beautiful town called Sandford - where there hasn't been a crime committed in years. Or so it would seem...

Well, in the sleepy, peaceful town Nicholas finds that all is not what it seems. Viewers see the first of several grisly murders - that murder is then staged as an accident. The town is prepared to write it off as an accident, but Nicholas is not. Against his protests that the accident is no accident, but actually a murder, the head of the local police force refuses to see it as anything other than an accident.

The plot then takes off relentlessly as Nicholas begins to untangle a web of deceptions. Mixed with the serious theme are so many genuinly funny scenes that this movie is more commedy than serious. At the end you will both cringe at some of the gory scenes and laugh at the same time.",1192924800,,1142,4.428571428571429
2660697,5,B000IOM9VQ,"So, I was recommended by a handful of friends to give this movie a watch, and, being in an action movie state of mind after watching the Bourne Ultimatum and Casino Royale, I gave it a try and fell in love with what I saw. Bear in mind I had never watched Shaun of the Dead, so I didn't know what to expect from Hot Fuzz. By the time I get to the end of the movie, my arms are thrown up in the air and I'm hollering with joy, ""This movie is so awesome!""

Why should you watch this movie? Well, for starters, if you liked Shaun of the Dead, you'll probably like Hot Fuzz even more. The gags are great and there are plenty of hilarious bits, and it's does well to balance the line between action comedy and full on spoof. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a parody, because while the setting is sort of a spoof on the slick, urban environments most buddy cop films take place in, it also makes several homages to other classics (and even name-dropping some: ""Point Break or Bad Boys II?""); however, it can still stand on its own as an action movie in its own right. Granted, the actual plot behind the murder mysteries is revealed all too fast (I've watched the movie more than ten times now and I'm still a bit murky on the details of the crime), but the gist of it is there, and you should be able to get a general idea of the plot without having to fully comprehend the minor details.

All gripes aside, this movie is excellent, and while the beginning is a bit slow, it ends on a perfect note, and is a thoroughly enjoyable film overall.

Now, as for the DVD itself, it is a bit light on special features, but it  delivers the goods. Features that are more content-heavy include The Fuzzball Rally, where you get to see the antics of writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright and actor Nick Frost as they toured the US promoting the movie, the deleted scenes, which had a lot of great content that, sadly, hit the cutting room floor during post-production, (there's even an extended version of the fence jump!), various commentaries (one with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright for the feature film, and one with Edgar Wright for the deleted scenes), and best of all, the Fuzz-O-Meter, a trivia track which adds some great insight to the feature film. There are other special features that are pretty minor, like ""The Man Who Would Become Fuzz"", where Pegg and Frost impersonate Michael Caine and Sean Connery, respectively, and also ""Danny's Notebook - the Other Side"", but they're also pretty enjoyable, no matter how short.
If I were to compare these to the special features on the Shaun of the Dead DVD, or even the special features on the DVD release of Hot Fuzz in the UK, it's pretty barebones, lacking a few things that I wish were included, such as a making-of featurette and the like.  If you're a REALLY die-hard (pun fully intended) fan of Hot Fuzz (or Simon Pegg in general), I just recently learned that Rogue Pictures will be releasing a 3-Disc special edition of the DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Fuzz-3-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000VNMMWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Fuzz (3-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, which I hear includes all of the special features from the UK release for the United States and Canada. Of course, it does cost more, but if you're a huge fan of the movie, this alternative is highly recommended.",1192838400,,3385,4.653846153846154
2660698,3,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz has won a lot of critical acclaim. It is not the sort of film you would dislike. Simon Pegg is absolutely great as a police officer who's been transferred to a small town in England from London. He is a thorough professional and takes his job a tad too seriously but he's stuck in a peace loving place like Sandford. At Sandford (small town) , he manages to find a few clues here and there as to murders which are made to look like accidents. The film is really fast because there are many one second shots and the movie dictates it's own pace. It is a good watch for almost all kinds of viewers. However, I felt the film was a tad too self indulgent in terms of it's comical structure. There are no overtly funny scenes because the storyline doesn't leave much room for humor. Humor is however squeezed out, almost cheesy sometimes. This is not a bad film, just isn't a standout either. One might disagree but ""Death Proof"" is my film of the year. Watch that.",1192665600,4,969,4.329670329670329
2660699,3,B000IOM9VQ,"From reviews and the trailer, I expected an English comedy.

2660700,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I was always a big fan of Hot Fuzz, unlike Shaun of the Dead I thought that Hot Fuzz was actually hilarious, it's one of those movies that I could watch over and over and never get sick of it. And I have been watching my DVD copy over and over, so I know the DVD version pretty well. But after watching the HD DVD version all I can say is ""wow"". The jump in quality for HD DVD is amazing, it looks SO much better on high definition. The fight scene in the supermarket looks so vibrant now, you can read all the labels, you can clearly see the splatter of tomato sauce, everything looks phenomenal. The soundtrack is also pretty amazing, in Dolby True HD the music really jumps out at you. It's like watching at the movies all over again.

Hot Fuzz on HD DVD is definately the movie I will be showing my friends to show off my HDTV set up and my sound system. HD DVD made one of my favourite movies even better, so I cannot give it anything less than five stars.",1191974400,,961,4.084656084656085

It was fun and positively humorous, but not and A+ movie, not even ""Airplane"" funny, more like.....well, a serious movie with ""trying to be funny"" like..........dang wut movie is ALMOST funny....anyway, you get my drift, a perfect one timer if you've got nothing else to do......except drink a few and laugh at this movie.....

2660702,5,B000IOM9VQ,"If I was asked to sum up this movie in one sentence... ""An interesting mix of suspense, action, hysterical comedy, and a slew of oddball characters."" would be my response.

The film starts off in the same spastic and fast-forward A.D.D. style that the trio of Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and Edgar Wright forged with their first parody-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"". (Another comedy-Gem that is well worth watching, many times over.) Though this movie seems to move at a much slower pace than ""Shaun of the Dead"" it still retains the absurd comedy of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg on screen. Both actors make this film move and they really fill the screen with their antics. The pop-culture references are just as prevalent in this film as its predecessor and still just as hilarious. Old and recent movies are also a big part in the film's plot-line such as references to ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II"". This film is based a lot on symbolism, so keep your eyes out for it. (This saves my fingers a bit and leaves the reader/viewer to look for themselves.)

I must admit though that even for someone like me who isn't bothered by film/media violence the movie did catch me somewhat off guard. This movie is graphic and in at least one place that I can say it actually even my stomach roll slightly. (Anyone who has seen the film can probably guess which I refer to.)

The last half hour of the movie is the huge old-west-meets-cop-action -shootout-with-comedy-mix-gun-battle. This is the part the whole movie builds up to. It's the absolute end-all-be-all of comedy action shootouts. Some of the weapons the villiagers use look like they were left over from World War II if not earlier. One villager even pulls out a Sten submachine gun, which was one big surprise to me.

Above all else...this movie is another must-have for the movie collection. I look forward to more work by creators Frost, Pegg, and Wright.

(On a side note, anyone who watches this film and has not already seen ""Shaun of the Dead"" should pick that movie up too. Seriously, you can't go wrong.)",1191888000,,2057,4.65564738292011
2660713,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is as much fun as I've had in a movie theatre all year.  A send-up of American action movies, particularly those made by noted hack Michael Bay, Hot Fuzz achieves what Bay's films could only imagine, they're both awesome and entertaining. This is one of the few films where your side hurts from laughing, but you have to stop clutching it, to cover your eyes from sudden explosions of gore or brutality. Filled with scene stealing performances, from Jim Broadbent as the chief, to Timothy Dalton as a diabolical supermarket supervisor, Hot Fuzz is easily the best comedy and action film of the year so far, and shouldn't be missed.",1191801600,,640,4.714285714285714
2660714,3,B000IOM9VQ,"I loved Shaun of the Dead, so I expected that same magical combination of action, humor, and homage in Hot Fuzz.  And that's mostly what I got.  Mostly.

Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel, a super cop that is driving the London bobbies mad because he's so good at his job.  To keep him out of their hair, the London office sends Angel to a little town known as Sandford.  There, he is teamed up with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), a bit of a slob who wants to be a good cop but learned most of it from watching movies like Point Break and Bad Boys.

Life's pretty boring in Sandford, but there's more than meets the eye. Like every good film made by British blokes, the city folk are secretly suspicious of the common people. And that of course means there's a cult lurking about that must be stopped. It all has something of a Wicker Man feel to it.

The first half of the film is something of a murder mystery, as black clad assailants reminiscent of Scream brutally off witnesses. Once Angel and Butterman discover the truth, the film degenerates into an all out gun-fest, including acrobatics, car chases, foot chases, and wicked one liners.

The problem with Hot Fuzz is that it's shot exactly like Shaun of the Dead, complete with the cut scenes, character dialogue, and gore.  Frost is playing almost the exact same character from the first film, except that instead of being a useless drug dealer he's a useless cop instead.

And then there's the gore. I've seen a lot of buddy cop shows and none of them are as disgustingly gory as the murders in Hot Fuzz. It's as if the movie was filmed by horror buffs who like action films, but they didn't know precisely how to create an action film so they went with what they know best - whenever a scene calls for gore, the movie goes way over the top. This includes one victim's head exploding on screen as a church spire drives down into his ribcage (we get to watch him stumble about a few seconds, sans head) and another church spire, this time in miniature, stabbing through a man's throat and up through his tongue and out his mouth. I mean, seriously...Scream wasn't this gross and it was a horror movie.

The movie wraps up with our intrepid cops blowing up a bunch of old people.  Which is either hilarious or a little tiresome, depending on what you thought of the film up to that point.

Although the interaction between Angel and Butterman are entertaining, Hot Fuzz's pacing is uneven, which is a shame.  Pegg and Wright's enthusiasm for the genre is infectious, but in this case they'd be better off renting cop movies than making one.

Those church spire scenes still give me nightmares. *shudder*",1191628800,6,2656,4.515657620041754
2660715,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I had bypassed this title many times thinking it was a typical low budget British comedy and I'd just wait until it came out on cable for free. When it was online for .99 cents, I decided to kill a Saturday afternoon and rented this. I was not expecting this movie to be as funny as it was nor did I expect it to be so well made. The acting was good, the actions scenes fun and I especially liked the way they edited it to flash 4 or 6 pictures in a row to quickly move ahead the story point. That technique condensed several probably boring (but necessary to the plot) scenes into a few seconds and got us right back into the action. I'd gladly watch it again.",1191628800,,661,4.092307692307692

2660718,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Ok, I hardly EVER write reviews on this site (or any for that matter, cause I just don't believe people on the Internet really care about other people's opinions, especially about movies) but this movie is fantastic and I really just wanted to put that quote in the subject line. If you, as an American, appreciate British humor, you will love Hot Fuzz; if you don't, you won't, it's a simple as that. It's not a SPOOF! There's an original story here. The filmakers did want to pay tribute to all the great buddy cop movies over the year, and they wanted to give it a British twist since there's never been a (good) British cop movie. I for one, thought Hot Fuzz was BETTER than Shaun of the Dead, as least as far as production values go. It clearly has a bigger budget, the cinematography is better, and it's generally a cleaner, cleaner looking film all around. The sound is ridiculously good on a solid home entertainment system. Do yourself a favor, go pick this one up, and enjoy it on the best format available for years to come.",1191456000,,1035,4.4526315789473685
2660719,5,B000IOM9VQ,"When I purchased this movie, I had never seen it and that's a big deal to me. It was based on a recommendation from an entertainment board that I belong to.

I loved it. My husband loved it. What's NOT to love? Simon Pegg & Nick Frost up to shenanigans again. It starts out slowly but it picks up very nicely pretty early on building until an huge ending.

If you like silly American buddy police action movices you'll love this. I love Point Break (for all its cheesiness) and combined with a staid country town, and it's a doozy. Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, it's not.

You may need to have the subtitles on just for clarity, but it's pretty easy to understand these guys compared to some of the shows they have on A&E or the Biography Channel (thinking Midsomer Mysteries). It's not going to save the world, but it's great fun for a couple of hours!",1191283200,,854,4.3924050632911396
2660720,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Although I enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead"" with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I didn't keep my copy of it. I absolutely loved ""Hot Fuzz"" and will definitely be getting the DVD. Pegg has shown some maturity and chops development and continues to make me want to see him in more roles. Wright is a competant actor as well and I'm sure they will both go on to bigger and better roles. This particular comedy had much more development and far more funny moments than ""Shaun of the Dead"". So along with the great acting from the cast I must applaud the writing and directing behind it. This is the funniest movie I have seen in a couple years. There are some obvious spoofs of movies like ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys"" which they even watch one evening.

An officer, played by Pegg, that had graduated at the top of his class, is so good at his work in London they don't want him making the rest the service looking bad. They send him off to a rural town to get him out of the way. Wright plays the officer that is his partner at the town. The rural town seems peaceful enough and at first it seems the worst he can expect are some unruly kids. But murders soon start occurring and his investigations run deeper than he ever imagined. A sinister plot becomes evident and he must declare war and go no holds barred into the town to see that justice is served. If you enjoy cop movies or comedies be sure to catch this wonderfully funny movie.",1190851200,,1430,4.296296296296297
2660721,4,B000IOM9VQ,This is basically Shaun of the Dead for cop movies.  It nails all the tropes and pokes fun at them without ever being mean.  At the same time it is a good movie.,1190764800,2,161,3.8484848484848486

Slap this bugger of a movie into the DVD player, and I'll be yawning not laughing.  This movie was a pile of rubbish. No laughs to be found anywhere. Now, I understand that its supposed to be British comedy, but British funny is defined as Monty Python. This couldn't hold a candle to that type of humor. It's a ridiculous bunch of nonsense with a story that goes nowhere very slowly.

2660753,5,B000IOM9VQ,"They did a great job with this one. Very stylish and engaging character intro at the beginning, and it quickly moved along to the main story. As far as the story goes, this is a great take on a detective story, but it's also a great spoof of detective story at the same time. Gotta love the ending, had me rolling on the floor.",1190592000,2,327,4.125
2660754,1,B000IOM9VQ,We could only get through the first twenty minutes of this movie and then we shut it off. Thank goodness I rented it for free from the public library. It was very slow and not funny at all.,1190505600,5,189,4.0
2660755,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I liked SHAUN OF THE DEAD but somehow I didn't rush out to see this one when it hit the theaters, maybe the title was too blah and the premise too confusing; it's a high concept picture all right, but somehow the concept was a little over my head.  Anyway thank heavens for DVD where I could stop and pause and ask ""What did he say?"" without making too much of a ninny of myself.  Simon Pegg is twice as good here as he was in the zombie movie, and Nick Frost keeps up with him every step of the way.  (There's a cute DVD extra in which the two play up, and over the top, the homoerotics of the script--and the script, by inference, of all the buddy action movies the film is satirizing.)  Pegg is extraordinary in his affect, heck, I'd hire him for a real action adventure!  It's a strange movie in that it doesn't even have the merest hint of a romance for our hero (maybe that's why Danny, the constable played by Frost, gets so much of Pegg's amorous energy).

Among the big (by British standards) names hired here to make supporting appearances, Jim Broadbent doesn't seem like they let him 100% into the joke, but Tim Dalton does his very best sly Alan Rickman as the manager of the local supermarket, Skinner, the man who becomes the leading suspect in a series of murders almost immediately.  It seems so obvious he had something to do with it, but if I were Timothy Dalton, would I bother cloaking my beauty with a the hooded cowl of a grim reaper?  That's how I knew it wasn't him!  It just wasn't making sense.  Billie Whitelaw, Samuel Beckett's favorite actress, has a blink and you'll miss her part, shame in a way because she can be very very funny and they might have given her more to do.  Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, all play little bit parts rather the way that Bing Crosby shows up in ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS, perhaps as a gesture of goodwill rather than actually contributing anything of substance.  It's the kind of movie you wind up watching twice or three times to catch the hundreds of zany verbal and visual cues and jokes you missed first time around.  The mystery plot isn't much, and Ira (STEPFORD WIVES) Levin, if he's still alive, is probably consulting with his plagiarism lawyers right now, but it's all in good fun and I hope the team continues for another round, next time I'll make it to the cinema opening night, instead of waiting for the DVD release.

Oh, avoid those deleted scenes--yet again you see why editors make tthe big bucks and the writers, not so much.",1190505600,,2517,4.408207343412527

2660791,4,B000IOM9VQ,"The creative forces behind the comedic take on zombie flicks, ""Shaun of the Dead,"" give us their interpretation of ""every action movie ever made"" with ""Hot Fuzz.""  Fans of ""Dead"" will immediately notice headliner Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, a London policeman who's excellence in service forces his superiors to ship him to a small country town in order to protect their own reputations.  ""Dead"" fans will also recognize his bumbling sidekick played by Nick Frost.  The duo quickly find plenty of trouble in their normally quiet town.  A large number of ""accidents"" occur that peak the interest of supercop Angel.  As the body count grows, Angel's list of suspects gets even larger.  Who's causing the accidents?  What action film isn't referenced?  It's all here in this superb comedy.

Edgar Wright's hard-cutting, musically driven direction style is all over this film.  Once again, fans of ""Dead"" will pick up on all of Wright's nuances as the story rolls along.  The action is fast, loud, and over-the-top.  It's also pretty gruesome and hilarious at the same time.  Pegg is dead on as Angel.  Despite his small stature you honestly believe that he's the ultimate police officer.  Frost is perfect as the local idiot who only has a job because his dad's the chief inspector.  The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British film.  Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Billie Whitelaw are just a few of the actors you'll find (some with large roles and others with just a blink of the eye's screen time).  Each and every person in this film hams it up perfectly and appears to have had fun with the film.

The action sequences are all pretty convincing.  Even the scenes that involve sweet old ladies packing automatic heat on a bicycle come off superbly.

The DVD is nice.  The extras are pretty decent, especially the Fuzz-O-Meter and ""The Man Who Would Be Fuzz.""  Overall, though, I'd buy this disc for the movie and not the extras.

If you enjoy spoofs (but not silly ones like ""Epic Movie""), check out ""Hot Fuzz.""  It's a lot smarter and funnier than you'd expect from a spoof.

'Shaun of the Dead''s Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return to form as mismatched police partners uncovering a complicated and ironically silly plot by 'Wicker Man'-style villagers to keep their tiny English town on the map.  The quick-edit techniques used to full effect in 'Shaun' get a little exhausting this time around, and the number of semi-obscure pop tunes thrown in can hardly be counted-- both probably a product of this outing's enhanced budget-- but it's the clever dialogue and characterizations that carry the day.

And the whole movie is like that. But I'm not complaining!

2660800,4,B000IOM9VQ,"The creative team behind the 2004 horror-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" takes on the action genre in the hilarious comedy ""Hot Fuzz"". Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's finest and most dedicated police officer who is reassigned by his superiors to the small crime-free village of Sanford. When a series of suspicious and gruesome accidents stuns this uneventful village, Sgt. Angel and his bumbling new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) learn that there is more to Sanford than it appears. ""Hot Fuzz"" is definitely one of the year's funniest films. The story is entertaining and offers some nice twists and very funny moments. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great comic chemistry. The 2007 action-comedy also stars Timothy Dalton (The Living Daylights), Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Academy Award winner Jim Broadbent (Iris). ""Hot Fuzz"" received overwhelming positive reviews from critics and proved a commercial success earning more than twice of ""Shaun of the Dead"".

If you missed ""Hot Fuzz"" in theaters, then I strongly recommend checking out this acclaimed comedy on DVD. ""Hot Fuzz"" is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a colorful and detailed video transfer. Its 5.1 EX Dolby Digital sound is clean and well balanced. The interactive menus are very appealing. Among special features, it includes the hilarious ""The Man Who Would Be Fuzz"" featurette, outtakes, deleted scenes, storyboards, trailers, ""Fuzz-O-Meter"" trivia option and a fun audio commentary with star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright.

The plot made no sense really, but it flowed pretty well and the laughs kept on coming so that I didn't care. Timothy Dalton was very good at being obviously evil and smarmy.

2660813,5,B000IOM9VQ,"""Hot Fuzz"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen for a while.  Although it's British, you need not be a fan of British humor to love it; indeed, most of its comedy derives from making fun of quintessentially American cop movies - particularly, the fun but reality-challenged ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boyz II"".  From the first minute, the script is packed full of comic gold.  There is no shortage of laughter from this movie!  In many ways, it's as if ""Evil Dead II,"" ""Dead Alive,"" ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and every American cop movie were combined into some perfect mutant stepchild.

In addition, ""Hot Fuzz"" is the most tightly-written and directed movie I've seen in years.  Literally every frame and every line in the first and second acts sets up, and is important to, the third act.  Not a single line could be cut without affecting the final act - something you can't say about virtually any other movie, unfortunately.  The movie is even better, and even funnier, for being written and directed with such economy.  And Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have never been funnier.

If you liked ""Shaun of the Dead,"" you will love ""Hot Fuzz.""  If you never saw ""Shaun of the Dead,"" then trust me, you will still love ""Hot Fuzz.""  Rent it, borrow it, buy it; but watch it somewhere, somehow.  You will be glad you did.",1188864000,,1310,4.570815450643777

2660833,4,B000IOM9VQ,"From the makers of ""Shaun of the Dead"" comes ""Hot Fuzz,"" a takeoff on cop buddy/action movies that is hilarious for about the first hour-and-a-half or so of its two-hour-plus running time, until it falls victim to its own over-the-top excesses.

Nicholas Angel is a London police officer with the highest arrest rate on the force.  Does this statistic earn him a round of applause, an increase in pay, or a promotion to a higher rank, as one might expect?  Heavens no.  In fact, Angel is so good at what he does that he has become something of an embarrassment to the far less highly-motivated cops who work with him.  Thus, he is sent to serve and protect the good citizens of Sandford, which is, we are told, the village with the smallest crime rate in all of England.  At first, Angel understandably balks at being such a big crime-fighting fish in such a small, seemingly crime-free pond.  And, indeed, he begins his service to the community by arresting large swaths of the city's population for decidedly minor infractions.  Soon, however, Angel finds himself embroiled in a far more pressing case when prominent citizens suddenly begin showing up dead, the victims of a possible serial killer who may recently have begun operating in the vicinity.

In its initial stages, ""Hot Fuzz"" is wickedly funny both as a parody of cop movie conventions and as a wry commentary on British rural values.  The typically dry and subtle humor arises from the juxtaposition of the by-the-book stick-to-itness of Angel with the lackadaisical indifference of virtually everyone else with whom he comes in contact.  It would have been very easy for director Edgar Wright and his co-scenarist, Simon Pegg (who also plays Angel) to have reduced the character to the level of a mere caricature or buffoon.  Instead, Angel comes across as a man fully aware of his high-strung obsessiveness (he's lost at least one marriage over it) yet powerless to change it.  Pegg is wonderfully restrained and deadpan as the highly focused, crime fighting Angel, while Nick Frost makes a perfect foil as Angel's inept, but starry-eyed partner who thinks the life of a cop should be more in keeping with what he sees in movies like ""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys II"" than what he regularly experiences on the job in Sandford.  There are fine performances, too, from Timothy Dalton, Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine, and many others.  And I defy you to pick out Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and Peter Jackson in their uncredited cameo appearances.

""Hot Fuzz"" might have been a flawless, classic comedy had the filmmakers been able to refrain from over-indulging their very obvious fondness for large-scale action sequences.  Indeed, it is not too long past the midway point that the movie begins to spiral out of control, as Wright and Pegg fall into the trap of mistaking parodies of tedious action scenes for tedious action scenes themselves.

Still, I choose to dwell not on the weaknesses of ""Hot Fuzz,"" but rather on its strengths, for here is a film that at least knows how to make us laugh for a good deal of the time that we are in its company.  And that's saying quite a lot these days.",1188691200,,3178,4.798165137614679

2660855,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Pegg and Wright have penned another side-splitter! Following the daunting success of ""Shaun of the Dead,"" it seemed this duo was doomed to failure (just in the same way that Broken Lizard could never SEEM to live-up to their epic-success ""Super Troopers""). Nonetheless, ""Hot Fuzz"" is equally as clever, insightful, and hysterical as their popular zombie flick. And, equally as niche: comedy-mystery! What's more, if you are hesitant to purchase this film for fear of not understanding ""British humor,"" you can dismiss those worries entirely!! While this film's humor transcends cultural-boundaries, you may find it amusing that it makes constant reference to popular American film (""Point Break"" and ""Bad Boys"" being the most obvious) and popular American culture (like Judge Judy). Moreover, it is helpful to watch the film with the captions on ... this way some of the  subtle word-play will be more easily caught (like the Judge Judy bit!!)

Stylistically, the film is a gem! If only American comedy was this slick! The framing is spectacular! As well as the repetition of shape!! (Like the spiral of the tombola drum juxtaposed with the spiral of the church stair-case ... so smart, so funny, so very pleasing!!) And in ""Hot Fuzz,"" you will find echoes of ""Shaun of the Dead."" Most prominent, you will note an emphasis on day-to-day rituals: ""What will it be? (The pub)"" ""Do you want anything from the shop?"" ... and then how these rituals are ""turned on their head"" by the film's conclusion. The result is deeply satisfying for the viewer. Likewise, you will find a similar soundtrack and use of cuts (like the ""swish"" sounds and quick cuts to indicate ritual). Again, both are tremendously successful and a hallmark of either Wright's direction or how this team elects to communicate ideas.

If you dig cop-comedy, buddy-flicks, the previous works of Pegg and/or Wright, or (one of my favorite Broken Lizard films) ""Club Dread"" (another comedy-mystery), you should thoroughly enjoy ""Hot Fuzz.""",1188345600,2,1999,5.088414634146342

Partnered with the chubby and inept Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), Officer Angel learns to slow down but not before discovering a few strange things about his new town. They've won, every year for some time now, an award for being the best town in England. Not much to argue with there. But Nick Angel soon sees death lurking here and there (and when I say death, I mean scythe and all!) Townsfolk are cut down and the local constabulary simply wave them off as accidents. But to Nick these are NOT plain old mishaps.

A conspiracy theory soon engulfs Nick's solo investigation and we find our lone hero riding a pale horse into town while loaded for bear (queue whistling Eastwood soundtrack here). The big question, though, is can he trust his lame partner, Danny, to back him.

Battles and bloodshed fill the screen as Nick finds himself at odds with everyone in Sandford. From blowing away the clergy to drop-kicking an octogenarian in the face, Nick has his arms, legs and other appendages busy keeping himself alive as much as solving these supposed murders.

There are a ton of great lines in the film, showing that writer/actor Simon Pegg has some significant screenwriting abilities (one of my favorite lines was after Nick and Danny watched Bad Boys and Nick said, ""Well, I wouldn't argue that it wasn't a no holds barred, adrenaline fueled thrill ride. But there is no way you can perpetrate that amount of carnage and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork."" And I enjoyed Danny's, ""By the power of Greyskull!"" moments, too.)

Making parodies of previously serious or scary films seems to be Pegg's and Frost's forte. And they do it exceptionally well. Although I think Shaun of the Dead is the gauge by which their future works will be judged, including this one, I also think they've hit upon something that isn't bathroom humorish like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scary-Movie/dp/B00004Z4WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scary Movie</a>&nbsp;films/franchise.

2660867,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz is the second comedy collaboration featuring actors Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Writer/Director Edger Wright.  There First collaboration, Shaun of the Dead was revered as one of the smartest comedic horror movie of it's time and has a huge cult following.  I remember stumbling on the film in the theater and thought the movie looked kind of interesting and saw it by myself at a midnight showing I walked out of the theater at 2am wanting to run back and watch it again. The smartest comedy, not written by the Coen brothers, maybe ever.  Hot Fuzz has a lot to live up to.  ""Shaun"" was one of those unique comedies that gets funnier after every viewing and it appears that Hot Fuzz has that same attribute.

This is a nice follow up to a genius piece of work and although it falls short of the Shaun of the Dead type brilliance (any follow up would fall short) it still is quick, witty, funny and to my surprise, gory!  This film is just a lot of fun, director Edger Wright just has such a style and charisma to his films that just resonates in me.  His style really fits this type of movie.  Simon Peg and Nick Frost are the new comedy due that play wonderfully off one another.  It's hard to imagine one without the other.  I'm sure I won't fully appreciate this film till I view it another 3 or 4 times but as of now it's a great comedy that everyone should run out and buy.",1188000000,,1386,4.296153846153846

I don't just mean extras separate to the movie, there are lots of in jokes, which may be a little bit of the problem with some people not finding some things funny. One thing I found not funny after purchasing the DVD, was the partially confirmed rumour that HOT FUZZ is coming out on a multi-disc version later this year, one reference can be found in the current commentary on this release where Simon Pegg refers to the ""other commentary"", well there is only one. And I completed a survey which refers to a Multi disc version coming out on a specific date.
Anyways, its clear that the guys are experimenting with development, since a bigger budget allows this, as well as getting Edward Woodward, although I did not spot Edward until I read the credits went back and saw who Tom Weaver was... seems like Edward is the Frenetic star you have when you just want a damn fine actor. And the other key point is that they have some of Britains finest Thespians.

2660885,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Best movie I've seen so far this year. Edgar Wright is a genius at parody, this time taking on the cop buddy genre. The quips and puns fly at 100 miles an hour here, it'd probably take three viewings to catch all of it. The film's central joke may get lost on some American viewers-this is a vicious dig at provincial rural locales in England and how petty and nasty their citizens can be.

I can't say enough about how clever this film is. Even the camerawork and cuts make you laugh because you know you've seen this type of stuff done with utmost earnestness in action/cop films-the swooshing of a gun into a holster, the click of a gun belt, the shifting of gears in a tense chase,that look of fierce determination on the hero's face as he prepares to get even-it's all done completely over the top and it works. Sergeant Angel is baaaaadassss.

My next door neighbor said it ""starts out slow"". What this means is that people talked alot. The lines are nonstop jokes and I guess nothing went kaboom for a little while. But there's even fun for the dimwitted here, with lots of gory death scenes and interesting weaponry being used. Wright and Pegg still love the horror genre, and somehow managed to graft that into Hot Fuzz as well.

I'd say this is like a Tarantino film or a Kevin Smith film. Not that I'm comparing the two. What I mean is that if you love movies as much as these people do...well, if you do, you already saw Hot Fuzz, didn't you? But anyway, if you think you love film, take this flick close to your heart. I would so use this as a litmus test for friends.",1187827200,,1581,4.33445945945946

2660890,4,B000IOM9VQ,"""Hot Fuzz"" is a parody of hot shot cop movies about a police officer who is sadly ignorant of cop movies. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is an overachieving London policeman with an arrest record 400% better than anyone else. He makes everyone else look bad, so he's promoted to Sergeant and shipped off to the town of Sandford, repeat recipient of the Village of the Year award. Under the laid back command of Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), Nicholas' unrelenting ""procedural correctness in the execution of unquestionable moral authority"" ruffles some rural feathers. When a series of gruesome deaths disturb Sandford's idyll, the consensus opinion is that they are accidents. With his affable and eager partner Danny (Nick Frost) in tow, Nicholas sets out to prove otherwise.

Writer/director Edgar Wright and writer/star Simon Pegg leave no cop movie clich unspoofed. ""Hot Fuzz"" succeeds because there is a real mystery, and Nicholas is a real character whose perspective is at odds with his new surroundings. Everyone thinks Nicholas' compulsive law-enforcing is irrelevant in a village with such a low crime rate -and a bizarrely high accident rate. Nicholas is out to prove that his values are correct and necessary. Beyond that, ""Hot Fuzz"" is funny most of the time and smart much of the time. It's made for multiple viewings, as you won't catch all the references and jokes the first time. I think it runs 15 minutes too long, but ""Hot Fuzz"" is top notch parody - not of the police, but of fastidious, busybody citizenry and, above all, of other cop movies.

The DVD (Universal 2007): Lots of bonus features. You can choose to view the film with a Storyboard option or a ""Fuzz-O-Meter"" (trivia track) option. In ""Storyboard"", a gray police badge appears in the upper right during some scenes. When it does, press ""enter"" on your remote to see the storyboards for that scene. The ""Fuzz-O-Meter"" displays facts about the movie and explains references in a subtitle below the film (in the black band). There is also a conversational but informative audio commentary by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. The commentary is constant and discusses actors, the references, directorial decisions, and various recollections of filming.

Other bonus features are: ""The Man Who Would Be Fuzz"", which is a 30 second snippet that looks like an outtake. There are ""Outtakes"" (10 min). 22 Deleted Scenes with optional commentary.  2 trailers. 2 television spots. ""Danny's Notebook"" (15 sec) which is a flip book not shown in the movie. ""The Fuzzball Rally: US Tour Piece"" (28 min) is voluminous behind-the-scenes footage of Wright, Pegg, and Frost on the film's US tour. ""Hot Funk"" (4 min) are some scenes with the dirty words replaced, allegedly for television viewing. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French.

2660937,5,B000IOM9VQ,"'Hot Fuzz' reunites the 'Shaun of the Dead' gang: Lead/co-writer Simon Pegg; director/co-writer Edgar Wright; and the hilarious sidekick Nick Frost. It's hard to say which is funnier. This one has a bit tighter story, but it's basically up to whether you find mocking American ammo-loaded buddy flicks or zombie movies.
In 'Fuzz,' Pegg plays Nick Angel, an uptight cop married to his job (with a bit of love saved for his Peace Lily). Angel is so good at his job that he gets 'promoted' to sergeant, but booted out of London to a tiny picturesque hamlet that's won tons of awards for its quaintness and charm. Sounds like a crap assignment for a hard-edged cop, but something sinister lurks beneath the surface.
In this village are a host of memorable characters reside, cheery innkeepers, smart alecky cops, a great Jim Broadbent as police chief always chowing on sweets, Frost as his well-meaning but none-too-brilliant son Danny  Butterman, Timothy Dalton is to-die-for as grocery store owner, positively dripping with sleaziness with a scenery-chewing glint in his eye. Edward Woodward is hilarious as the head of the neighborhood watch, with cameras perched all over town, his group fretting over the human statue and jugglers and kids in hoodies. Amidst all this strange deaths begin happening: The theatre director/actor (butchering Shakespeare like you wouldn't believe) and his bit of tail (with a horrid laugh) have an unfortunate accident; a nosy reporter meets an unfortunate end in a death that's reminiscent of 'The Omen,' the refrigerator magnate (get it?) dies in a horrible explosion and on and on. Only Angel believes that these are connected and aren't accidents, and he's a man on fire to find out. Unfortunately all the chief wants him to do is track down a swan who's flown the coop.
There are great touches from 'The Wicker Man' here and many more greats filling out roles as the townsfolk. The conclusion (I won't give away what is at the heart of it) but it's absolutely hilarious and totally absurd.",1186444800,3,2025,4.955882352941177

But more important than that, it is hilarious. I've watched this twice today. It just keeps getting funnier. This is by far the best comedy to come out since even before Shaun of the Dead.

I try to think of something that I don't like about this movie, but there's very little to speak of. I would've liked to have seen more of Angel's stint in London. There's a complaint.

2660939,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I loved ""Shaun of the Dead,"" Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's previous collaboration.  It was a wonderful homage to horror movies--both a parody and, oddly enough, a horror movie in and of itself.  ""Hot Fuzz"" takes that concept one step further--by combining parody and action, it creates a self-aware action movie that stands as both a parody and one of the most thrilling movies you will ever see.

Nick Angel is a top London cop--he's so good, he's making the rest of the force (excuse me, that's SERVICE) look bad.  So they ship him out to Sanford, a peaceful village that hasn't seen a murder in 20 years.  Or has it?  As Angel befriends the Inspector's son (and fellow policeman officer), he begins to see that Sanford isn't what it seems; the murder rate is nill, but the accident rate is astronomical.  And when a local business owner keeps showing up at the scenes of accidents...could something fishy be going on in this peaceful English village?

Indeed, something is.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver knock-out performances yet again, as does the superb supporting cast (including Timothy Dalton, who manages to steal most of his scenes--not an easy task, considering the talent in this movie).  Pegg and Wright's writing remains top-notch; the movie is witty almost to the point of being unbearable.  I rented it Friday night, went out and bought it Saturday, and watched it twice more.  It's that good.  ""Hot Fuzz"" is quite simply one of the best comedies to come out in years; it is smart, funny, and just damn FUN.",1186358400,2,1529,4.746212121212121
2660940,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Two things need to be understood before you watch this movie:

First, that it's tongue in cheek! Although it's an homage to cop movies, it does so by making fun of them! But not in the way American comedies make fun genres. This is not Epic Movie or the Airplane movies. It's much more subtle than that!

And that it's British. Some Americans just don't get British humor! I don't know why but they just don't find British humor funny. If you don't get British movies or TV, you aren't going to get this either!

If are cool with both of those things, then you are going to love this movie! I did! I was rolling with laughter. First off, Nick and Simon have such great chemistry, such comic timing, and are so fun to watch that they could hold the movie all on their own! But add in all the extra characters including Timothy Dalton, who is so damn funny and over the top! Then there's the clever dialog. The wit in this movie is razor sharp! Finish it off with great direction, strong production values, and excellent editing and you've got a movie that is a riot to watch

What I think trips people up about this movie and Shaun of the Dead is that they can't categorize it. It's a comedy, but it's a farce about cop movies, totally makes fun of the gore in some cop movies (Bad Boys II) by going over the top with the violence (ie church spire), and all around entertaining romp! It is not for the weak of heart nor is it for the casual comedy fan. This is a movie made for movie fans!

Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest, grossest, exciting, and entertaining movies I've seen in years! Keep it up Nick and Simon!",1186358400,4,1613,4.258169934640523
2660941,3,B000IOM9VQ,"It's definitely not in the ""hysterical"" category. Moments of understated humor throughout, nothing side-splitting; more overt in the second half. The main character spoofs action movie staples and lines. The main plot point, though, the reason for all the killings, when finally revealed, *is* hilarious indeed, one of the funniest concepts ever, almost worth watching the whole movie.

Some quite grisly denouements, one or two of which are guaranteed to make you wince. The explosive ending is completely unnecessary. Timothy Dalton is wonderfully greasy.",1186358400,5,557,5.630952380952381
2660942,4,B000IOM9VQ,This movie is great fun! A total spoof of every cliche cop movie ever made. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are wonderful as the law enforcers. Although the box says hilarious I wouldn't go that far. Yes its funny but I didn't find myself slapping my knee. Shaun of the Dead is funnier! That's just my opinion and both films aregreat. Peter Jackson has a flash of a scene and so does Bill Nigty.,1186358400,,389,4.27027027027027
2660943,4,B000IOM9VQ,"This film has such a funny light heart that it can make some amazingly gross violence seem innocuous and quite funny.  I am not sure how it is pulled off, but, really, it is FUNNY.  It is a British film so you might have a slight accent problem (I do not) and you will have to get used to the driver being on the opposite side of the police car than you expect.  But other than some turns of phrase, the movie takes on the cop genre in a way that is thoroughly understandable to anyone who has ever seen a cop film or show.

Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a stereotypical supercop.  He has never wanted to be anything else, passed the schooling with superb scores (a double first in British terminology), and has racked up a tremendous and heroic record on the force.  His reward?  Being sent to a bucolic village far from anything requiring the kind of police work Nicholas has ever cared to do.

But we all know that villages are not always as they seem, right?  I don't want to talk about the movie's plot because it isn't particularly difficult to figure out, but going through the parody is much more fun  than having it described to you is.  Sgt. Angel's partner, PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is terrific (Frost and Pegg are friends and often work together).  The movie uses every, and I mean EVERY cop show clich and makes them all fun.  Just be willing to put up with a bit of swearing (there is a swear box to raise money for the church roof, after all) and some amazing violence.  Timothy Dalton plays a terrific slimeball named Simon Skinner.  Jim Broadbent, whom I always love on screen, is superb as Inspector Frank Butterman (Danny's dad).

Enjoy!  By The Power of Grayskull! (yeah, they use the line from He-Man in the movie).",1186272000,,1753,4.428125
2660944,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I purchased this movie based entirely on the fact that it was brought to us by the team who made ""Shaun of the Dead"", one of my favorite movies.  While ""Hot Fuzz"" does not quite meet my expectations, it stands on its own as a very funny mystery action comedy.  It doesn't quite have the great timing that ""Shaun of the Dead"" is known for, nor does it have as many hilarious quotes, but I have watched it several times and I enjoy it more and more.  Being a British comedy the humor is very dry and subtle compared to American films so you may have to watch it once or twice to catch everything, but its worth it.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action films, comedies, mysteries, or ""Shaun of the Dead"".  Just be warned that there are a few scenes with a lot of blood and gore, though they are brief (maybe a minute of actual gore per violent scene at the most).  I don't mind them but I wasn't expecting them.",1186272000,,928,4.185393258426966

2660966,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I liked shawn of the dead, and so this one was a no brainer to buy. Well, its good, but a bit long. I really wanted to see how the movie ended, so the story was good, and the humor was there, but about mid movie, I had figured it out and just wanted to see the ending.  The movie revolves around London's best police officer getting transferred to Samford because he's to good, I.E. he makes the rest of the cops look bad.  Well, little did he know he was going to walk a nice country villiage and discover a hidden secret about the population and the smoke and mirrors the town is built on.  Anyway, if you liked Shawn of the Dead, then the humor in this one is perfect for you.",1186185600,,679,4.052238805970149
2660967,5,B000IOM9VQ,"...it gives me a reason to watch all the boneheaded action movies it references/parodies so I can fully appreciate the inside jokes my friends got that I didn't.  (Not that my friends are boneheads...)  However, the excellent bonus features include the whole movie with on-screen ""Fuzz Facts"" detailing every movie reference, and packed with trivia detailing the filmmaker's research on everything from police jargon to the Japanese Peace Lily.

At first I thought ""Hot Fuzz"" was not as good as ""Shaun of the Dead.""  I was wrong.  This is brilliant.  I attribute the error to my personal preference for zombies as opposed to police officers.  (Damn.  There go any ""helpful"" votes from police officers...)  If you're reading this you don't need me to tell you what the film is about or why it's funny.  I just hope we see more from Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright soon.

Other bonus features include--and I actually wondered about this--the other side of Danny's gory flip/cartoon notebook!  As well as hilarious outtakes and deleted scenes, and a featurette on Pegg/Wright/Frost's U.S. publicity junket for the film.  Great job all around, the DVD as well as the film itself.",1186185600,2,1184,4.979591836734694

It was literally a laugh a minute and I probably laughed more because I ""get"" the humour.  I know people who have seen this and Shaun of the Dead and didn't find them funny at all.  I am not knocking them, but not everyone ""gets"" British humour.  I thought this was funnier than ""Shaun"", but that still cracks me up after numerous viewings. In reality of course, there is no Sandford in Gloucestershire (where I used to live).  This was all filmed around the Wells, in Somerset, about 70 miles south.  Timothy Dalton was great as the villain (and Somefield is a real Supermarket chain over there by the way). The ending or should I say endings, was brilliant.  It seemed like the movie would end then something else would happen.  This is not just the funniest film of the year, but the funniest ever, with great comic timing, great stars and cameos (yes it is Cate Blanchett), and the hilarious Bill Bailey (who I'd like to see crop up in more movies).  Can't wait to see what they will take on next.",1186185600,,1135,4.3364928909952605
2660969,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Hot Fuzz marks the second movie from the guys that gave us Shaun of The Dead, a fun romatic-comedy-zombie movie.

Hot Fuzz is a story a story of Nick Angel, a great London cop who is so good he is sent to a sleepy little country town, in witch he relises big time crime can still happen in a small town.

The comedy in Hot Fuzz is to take every movie clice and put them in a movie, not as a parody, but to simply take notice of them.  A long montage of quick cuts show Nick processing paperwork, for example.  The movie is fun and full of energy.  Nick Frost and Simon Pegg do a great job and provide the movie with the right amount of charm to the screen.

The DVD does a good job in the audio and picture quality.  The bouns features get the job done but aren't as extensive as most DVDs now released.

Overall if you enjoy comidies and/or action movies you'll find some enjoyment in this picture.",1186185600,3,899,4.126436781609195
2660970,4,B000IOM9VQ,"When you see the previews for Hot Fuzz and you look at the ridiculous title, you think that this is going to be Reno: 911 all over again.  When you buy the DVD on a whim and check it out, knowing that it has Simon Pegg and Nick Frost from Shaun Of The Dead in it, you are pleasantly surpised that it's not all that tongue-in-cheek, as the title and the previews suggest.  In fact, Hot Fuzz is a very well done movie chockful of English humor and bits and pieces of ultra-violence.  Much like Shaun Of The Dead, minus the zombies of course.  Definitely wasn't the dumb but funny movie I was expecting, Hot Fuzz is well-plotted with intelligent humor and over-the-top situations.

Seargeant Nicolas Angel is sent to a sleepy little country village from London because he's literally such a great cop that he's making everyone else look bad.  Trying to fit in, and finding it extremely hard to do so, Angel is face with several grisly accidents that make him suspect the sleepy little village is not all that it seems.

Written by Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg, this movie is not quite a classic, but definitely one I would recommend and watch again. If you liked Shaun Of The Dead or are just a fan of dry English humor, this will be a treat for you.

2660972,4,B000IOM9VQ,"From the same crew that brought us the smashing Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz gleefully satires the mainstream, tough guy, bug budget, bullet-laden action films that big studios always push out on us.  Simon Pegg stars as supercop Nicholas Angel, whose action filled career in the big city comes to an unexpected end when he is reassigned to a quiet, quaint, and overly boring village.  Or so we think.  Soon enough, people start meeting mysterious, and bloody, demises, and Angel suspects foul play is afoot.  Teaming up with the dim-witted Danny (Nick Frost), Angel soon finds himself over his head to say the least.  Make no mistake that Hot Fuzz is incredibly funny and instantly enjoyable for those who enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and longtime action movie junkies alike.  Director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Pegg clearly have a love for the genre that allows them to have such casual fun, even though the film never feels like the labor of love that Shaun of the Dead did.  Despite that though, Hot Fuzz is a blast (if a bit overlong) and features a bevy of star talent including Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Cranham, and a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Cate Blanchett.",1186099200,,1204,4.759615384615385
2660973,2,B000IOM9VQ,"Seriously, the hype over this film on DVD is unreal.  I was not that impressed with the previews but I decided to check it out anyways.  I usually laugh pretty much at everything and anything and I thought maybe the comical approach this film had would be to my liking.

Other than a few funny general spoof plays on London police procedure, this thing is a waste of time.  I just did not see any value to it whatsoever.  Am I being a stick in the mud?  Perhaps I missed something, but considering I have loved films that range from comical to crime drama, this one is at the bottom.  What it does is TRY to be funny, and nothing could be more revolting.",1186099200,7,654,4.225806451612903

The HD-DVD gets very special treatment as it includes a host of extras not found on the standard DVD release.  I haven't had the time to go through them all but I've read they add up to nearly 18 hours.  Video and audio quality are absolutely superb.

2660985,5,B000IOM9VQ,Hot Fuzz is one of the few current DVD movies I've bought... That's why I'm here. It is a remarkable parody of Tough Guy films with lots of layers. It also has several logical plot twists and brilliant foreshadowing that is clear only with hindsight. It is said that the best comedy is done strait as if it is a serious drama... and this film is an exemplar of that axiom,1186099200,2,371,4.23943661971831
2660986,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I'm not to big a fan of ""comedies"" these days.  In fact, I've pretty much stopped seeing comedies.  Every day there is a new one that comes out, filled with sex, poop and fart jokes (American Pie, and movies such as that).  Those movies disgust me, and I can't stand them.  However, once in awhile a great comedy comes along that I truly enjoy, and most recently this movie was Hot Fuzz.

Lets start off by saying that this movie is literally my favorite comedy of all time.  There's no question.  Also up there with my favorites is Shaun of the Dead, made by the same guys.  This movie is so witty and smart that I was blown away.  It's not one of those where some guy farts and everyone laughs, not at all.  You have to actually listen to what they say and what they show, and everything that is said or shown is played upon later in the film.  It's just incredible.

The acting is top notch, and Simon Pegg as a super-serious constable is flawless.  Nick Frost as his action-movie junky partner is equally impressive.  Besides the acting, the actual movie making and technology is quite astonishing for a comedy. It's seamless.  The action scenes are top-notch, making this not only a parody, but an action movie all in it's own. During these scenes, countless references are made to other defining action movies, most noticeably Bad Boys II and Point Break.  I could not stop laughing at a point when Frost shot his gun up in the air, instead of at his father, a scene straight from Point Break.

Everything in this movie is funny, and even when they are pretending to be serious, you just have to bust out laughing. This comedy is truly a work of art, and it propels itself far out in front of any other than I've ever seen. There are even some obvious ""lets act stupid"" jokes for those who aren't into analyzing movies, but they are well done and don't ruin the movies intelligence at all.

Again, this movie is considered a parody, but is a fine action movie itself. If you absolutely don't feel like thinking when laughing, then this is still a solid action flick wit hardcore action.  I highly recommend this movie for everyone (not children, of course), although a fair amount of pop-culture knowledge is needed to get many of the jokes. Regardless, this movie is a classic.  See it for sure, whether that means buying or renting, just see it.  Can't wait to see whats next for this movie-making team.",1186012800,3,2411,4.496551724137931

Pegg is certain they are really murders, and with Frost at his side, he finds out he's not wrong at all.
The dialogue and situations are original and witty, and the movie is surprisingly graphic in its violence, but hey these are guys who gave us lots of blood in SHAUN!  The supporting cast is wonderful featuring nice bits from Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward and Billie Whitelaw.

2660990,5,B000IOM9VQ,"With a fiendishly witty farce just as scathingly hilarious as its predecessor, the creators of Shaun of the Dead swap zombies for all things action in the wildly creative homage thrill-ride Hot Fuzz. An impressive ensemble of talented actors join Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as they lovingly mock action classics from Point Break to Bad Boys to Hard Boiled. In one of the most intelligently scripted films of the year, buildings explode, clips expend, and cars fly through the air in slow motion as this no-holds-barred kaleidoscope of action leaves no adventure clich untouched and no old lady unscathed.

Veritable supercop Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is reluctantly transferred to the sleepy rural town of Sandford after his unmatched police records and merits have pressured the rest of London's police force to attempt to compete. Finding it difficult to adapt to the overly peaceful community, Angel befriends fellow officer Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), a dimwitted policeman who admires the hard-boiled London cop. When seemingly random citizens start meeting with untimely ""accidental"" deaths, Angel suspects foul play and sets off to expose a dangerous serial killer and uncover the dark conspiracy surrounding Sandford's tranquil facade - all whilst shooting two guns and jumping through the air.

Hot Fuzz pays tribute to every staple of the action film genre, from high-speed car chases and blazing shoot-outs to slow-motion stunts and hard-to-kill villains. Every fundamental is addressed and astutely parodied with several key films in mind. The homage to Point Break and Bad Boys is crystal clear, but the genre-spoofing duo have done their homework - scenes derived from Rambo, Die Hard, Hard Boiled, Lethal Weapon and the Man With No Name trilogy await the action film connoisseur.

Reprising his role as the serious character in a bizarrely comical situation, Simon Pegg once again provides plenty of laughs as the take-charge fish-out-of-water who unwittingly becomes involved in the sinister conspiracy at Sandford. Nick Frost also lends a familiar persona, this time as a bumbling police officer pining for the extreme action he sees in movies. Other regulars include Bill Nighy as the London Chief Inspector and Martin Freeman as a desk sergeant. Veteran actor Timothy Dalton appears as Simon Skinner, the devilish manager of a local grocery store, while Rafe Spall and Paddy Considine bring a refreshing sarcasm to the two mustachioed officers Cartwright and Wainwright.

Hot Fuzz takes a decidedly R-rated approach to the action, dialogue, and violence, but somewhere between brutal decapitations and roundhouse kicking an old lady in the head comes a sadistically stylish brand of comedy as diabolically entertaining as it sounds. Blood flies as fast as the ingenious jokes and even priests and handgun toting cyclists aren't spared from Pegg's ruthless blend of fuzz and fireworks. Much in the same way Shaun of the Dead tackled its subject with a clever tongue and nave characters, Fuzz pits Nicholas Angel against the elements of an action movie, though this time he's far more qualified for the job. While the intricate murder mystery furthers the plot along, all the events are really just a methodic build to the explosive final showdown with the bad-guys - a culmination any action movie worth its salt would provide. And what a conclusion it is, with high-octane explosions, insane duels, and fantastically over-the-top stunts that perfectly exaggerate the outlandish beauty of the movies that inspired it.

Whether trading zombies for action films is an upgrade in your book, it's hard to deny that Pegg, Frost, and director Edgar Wright have proven once again that they know how to get a laugh. Hot Fuzz is a raucous riot of sharp quips and glorious carnage, bloody battles mixed with cunning caricatures and witty mimicry- a sublime combination not seen since the classic action films it so eloquently parodies.

The 5.1 Dolby digital plus ex sound gives all speakers a thorough workout and  has your sub delivering tight bass for the majority of the movie.  Your receiver need not be turned up during dialogue that is also spot on and delivers crisp sound from the center channel.
As for the movie itself, director Edgar Wright re teams with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost along with a host of other actors from his earlier film Shaun of The Dead.  Hot Fuzz like Shaun pays homage to a genre of films, in this case the action film as opposed to horror.  However there are kills in Hot Fuzz that could rival most horror movies.  Homage is payed to the action genre, yet Hot Fuzz still creates a totally unique and creative spin all on it's own.  I like Shaun of the dead very much and I found Hot Fuzz to be more creative as there are plenty of plot twists and turns.  It is not a spoof at all and Edgar Wright takes his material seriously.  I would also mention Hot Fuzz is a great deal better than the action films it pays homage to.  Toss in a ton of laughs and this is one entertaining movie.
The picture quality was also dead on, i mention the sound quality so much because it was so amazing.
Hot Fuzz is already ranked on the internet movie database's top 250 films at number 140 currently.  It is also one of the highest reviewed films of the year earning a tomatometer of 90% out of 173 critic reviews.

Shaun of the Dead was one of those movies that was so good that you couldn't just write it off as a fluke... The acting was great, the jokes were hilarious, and despite it's name it turned out to have it's own story, not just a spoof of Dawn of the Dead. So the first day this came out, I bought it right away knowing it would be great, and indeed it was! (Wish I could say the same for 300...*Sigh*)
There's no comparing it to Shaun of the Dead, it's an entirely different story with a different kind of humor, but I loved it just as much as Shaun of the Dead, and I'm glad I bought it before it sold out!

If you liked Shaun of the Dead, then buy this movie! They're not really anything alike, but Nick Frost & Simon Pegg are the same funny, mismatched pair as they were in Shaun of the Dead! With Pegg as the straight-laced by-the-book model Police officer, and Frost as the bumbling side-kick who loves American Police action movies, and wants nothing more than to get into car chases, gun fights, and every other staple of American Police action movies that he just can't seem to fing in his small town.
If you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead, then buy that too!

2661017,5,B000IOM9VQ,"I loved Shaun of the Dead, so I knew that I would enjoy this movie a little. I was wrong...I enjoyed this movie a lot.

The story is great...a do-good London cop gets exiled to a small town in the country.  His impeccable work record is making his coworkers at the London Metro Police look bad.  His small town coworkers think he's the big fish in the small pond just looking for high crime and murder around every corner...but they say every thing is just an accident, or is it really?  The greater good...it's all for the greater good...

Sure there are some predictable jokes involved, but I think they are pulled off with right twist by the actors who know they are predictable. Timothy Dalton does a fabulous job as a twisted Supermarket Manager/Owner. I love his line commenting about the performance of a local community theatre blonde bombshell ""I could just bash in your head to let out all your secrets."" There are some great cameo appearances by Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Paul Freeman. The editing is fantastic with quick jerking cuts of doors opening to show transition from one scene to the next, which is seen in Shaun of the Dead. The dialogue is also fantastic...there are many references to other films including Shaun of the Dead. You will have to watch it over and over to catch all the references...

If you loved Shaun of the Dead and like comedies with a good story line, then this movie is right up your alley...",1185926400,,1440,4.562015503875969
2661018,5,B000IOM9VQ,"The overriding themes of justice, adversity, and mateship are easy enough to identify with, and in conjuction with the decently written murder mystery could be enough to carry this film for a mainstream audience, but there's also a constant string of kinda old-fashioned subtly comedic moments that will more likely confound than amuse.
It has that thing going on where you never know what to take seriously. So many things happen that make me think what was the point of that, and it's because they don't fit conventions. There was nothing in the movie that made me think I can see what they're going for there and I don't think they achieved it or I think they overdid it. Everything is just it's own thing. There isn't any movie I've ever seen that I can say that about as fully as this one. The recreation of the Point Break scene was probably the most typical formulaic gag in the movie, and one of the few that actually made me laugh.
The most creative/unconventional movie I've ever seen in my life and the only movie I'll admit I'm not smart enough to appreciate.",1185926400,,1071,4.583333333333333
2661019,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg have proven that lightning can strike twice with their 2007 comedy ""Hot Fuzz.""  As was the case with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B000B2YR8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>,"" they are following in the grand tradition of Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Frankenstein/dp/B000G6BLWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Frankenstein</a>"" by embracing the genre they are spoofing and taking everything that happens dead seriously, which is what makes it hysterical.  Plus, once again Pegg and his sidekick Nick Frost have created characters that have heart, so that we care about them as well as laughing at their antics (of everything that happened in ""Shaun of the Dead"" the part I remember most is Shaun being upset over the fate of his mother).  So when we get to the final act of ""Hot Fuzz"" and the film actually slips into an even higher gear, we get to root them on all that harder.

This time around Pegg is Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a guy who is no bumbling Inspector Closseau.  In fact, Sergeant Angel is so competent that his bosses want to get rid of him because he is making everybody else in the police service look bad.  So Angel is banished to Sanford, a perfect little English village supposedly devoid of crime.  Of course Angel finds cause to arrest just about everybody he runs into, only to be informed by his new boss, Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), that they look at things differently in Sanford.  Everybody is town speaks of ""the Greater Good,"" and it seems that we are being set up for your standard story about a hard core true believer learning that the spirit of the law is as important as the letter of the law.  Angel is partnered with PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), and we have the requisite pair for the buddy part of the picture and it looks like all of the pieces are in place.

However, there is something rotten in the village of Sanford, personified by Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), the local rich guy.  There might not be any crime in Sanford, but there sure are a lot of accidents and Angel quickly figures out that these suspicious accidents might be sneaky murders.  The payoff for this whole bit is most decidedly English in nature, which is part of what makes it so funny, especially when old hands like Billie Whitelaw and Edward Woodward are playing some of the eccentric characters.  I do not know what the record is for most cuts in a film, but with ""Hot Fuzz"" film editor Chris Dickens has got to be in the running.  This movie is not just cut like an action film, it is cut like an action film on speed, which becomes another part of the fun.  An hour into this film I thought there was only a half-hour left, but it turned out we were only halfway through this entertaining film.  As for what I shall remember most from this action comedy, it would have to be the fate of the villain Skinner and one of the more memorable ""boy, that has got to hurt"" moments of all time.",1185926400,8,3124,4.899430740037951

Avoid thinking of it as a parody; this is nothing of the sort as defined by recent American in-your-face parody styles (such as Scary Movie, et.al.)  Instead, British parody is much more subtle and witty as redefined by this brilliant film.  But be warned.  The 2nd half of this movie is quite fast paced at times.

Pay attention or you'll miss many great visual and audio gags.  For example, the townfolk refer to their town as a ""model village"" (referring to its reputation as a great place to live).  At the end there's a confrontation in a scale model of the village.  Get it -- model - village.  This movie is loaded with subtle references that require the viewer to pay attention to fully appreciate.  I was grinning ear to ear for 2 hours until my cheeks hurt.

This is one of the dummest movies I have ever watched.  I don't think this ""comedy"" even deserves one star, maybe a minus 5 stars.",1185840000,4,304,4.189655172413793
2661023,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This is an excellent send up of Cop movies.  However, let me get this straight:  it is not as funny as Shaun of the Dead, the first movie this great group came up with.  However, it is still much better than most of the movies out there.

Shaun of the Dead is much funnier with each successive viewing.  I think this flick might be the same.  There are some great bits that I won't give away here.

So let's talk about the HD DVD, since that is the version I got (I don't think it is out on Blu Ray).  The transfer is awesome... the best I have seen thus far.  No visible lines or... er... fuzz.  Sound is excellent.  I hear the extras are to die for, but I haven't had a chance to dive into those:  four different audio commentaries, lots of shows, and other bits.  Also, of course, Picture in picture extras which Blu ray just can't do right now.

Movie 4.0 (it's a bit predictable-- but still fun to watch)
HD transfer 5 (It's perfect)

All in all 5.0.  Great movie.",1185840000,,976,4.144385026737968
2661043,5,B000IOM9VQ,"That's kind of a surprising thing to hear, no? When you consider how many romantic comedies and whatnot that have been released this year, you'd think I'd have laughed more. Well, sort of. Some of them, such as Catch and Release and Because I Said So were not that funny or even charming (although I can stare at Mandy Moore all day). But now and then you see one that makes you forget all the bad ones you've seen and while it does have its flaws, Hot Fuzz is probably one of the funnier movies this year, and strangely enough, one of the better action ones too.

Nicholas Angel is a remarkably talented police officer with exceptional skills and a strong devotion to the law. However this creates jealousy among the other London cops since he makes them look worse by comparison so they ship him off to the small town of Stanford, known for its low crime rate and multiple ""Village of the Year"" wins. Many in town are not too excited to have him there and friend Danny is the only one who follows him which is helpful since a number of murders have been happening. Who's behind it and can Nick get through the town's ineptitudes to solve the case?

The last time director Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost made a comedic film was with the surprise hit, Shaun of the Dead. Combining horror violence with comedy, it was a nice mix although at times the horror kind of overtook the comedy parts. Now they've combined comedy with action movies, namely the buddy films with 2 cop partners having to solve a case and blow stuff up too. Here, it's used to great effect and while some jokes don't work (a mumbling farmer for one) you have others that are just hysterical. I bet lot of you will start quoting the ""yarp/narp"" thing after watching this.

But how about the action? Well it mainly pops up at the end and until then we get some graphic murders that while nowhere the level of Hostel (although one involving a rooftop is a doozy), the film picks up at the end where it actually becomes exciting. Imagine that: a great shootout in a comedy movie. Sacre bleu! While it does do that quick editing used by a lot of new directors. you never lose track of the events. If there's one thing that slightly takes the film down is the pacing at the beginning. While I don't mind films that take awhile for the ""real stuff"" to get going such as Aliens which took near an hour for the first sign of the thing to show up, here it feels kind of long.

Acting-wise you can always rely on the group to be funny without being less than real people. Simon Pegg for instance who played kind of a well-meaning slacker in Shaun plays the serious-as-hell Nicholas and he pulls if off without being unintentionally funny. We also get cameos from Bill Nighy of Dead Man's Chest/At World's End fame, Martin Freeman of the British version of the Office, Timothy Dalton and apparently even Peter Jackson in a quick cameo.

Funny enough, released the same day as this on DVD was 300, a movie that wanted to be an epic even though it was strictly base entertainment. But for some reason Hot Fuzz is a comedy movie that kind of becomes a bit more. It's probably not the most important comedy this year but it's surely the funniest.",1185840000,5,3219,4.421585160202361

2661048,3,B000IOM9VQ,"Picked up HOT FUZZ (official copy, early release) a movie worth 10 stars, by the way, and was dismayed to discover that our version only has one disc, where as the PAL region 2 version has two discs.

Of course, the bulk of the extras to do with the movie's production, are on the second disc in the PAL region 2 set, with a couple of incidentals on the 1st disc (but the first disc has 4 commentaries).

What we get is the first disc of the PAL set, minus 3 of the commentaries.

BUT...

If you shell out for an HD player and the HD-DVD version of this film, then you get both discs from the PAL set with all of the extras.

This really ticks me off, as I can't see why they couldn't have released a 2 disc DVD set (heck, I would have paid the extra cash) instead of the crappy single disc one.

The same is also true with the SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HD-DVD, as it has the two extra commentaries missing from the DVD version (but present on the PAL release).

Yeah sure, I could get a region free DVD player and pick up the PAL versions of these movies, but to do that would mean to downgrade to a no name DVD player (as usually the region free units are made by cheapie companies like, ACME, etc...) where as I have Sony and Panasonic units at the moment and like the quality of these.

And at the moment, I don't want to invest in HD or BLUE-RAY, until the industry gets their act together and picks a format that all movies will be released under.

2661049,4,B000IOM9VQ,"One of the sleeper comedies of the year is HOT FUZZ, a film that pairs such unlikely themes as the tough-talking cop (Joe Friday in DRAGNET) with the unsuspecting cop surrounded by bucolic crazies (THE WICKERMAN) and a knife-wielding robed slasher (SCARY MOVIE).  Simon Peggie is Constable Angel who is transferred from London to a Stepford Wives type small town where nothing and no one is what it seems.  Regardless of the situation, Sgt. Angel refuses to permit any type of offense to go unpunished, an action which soon gets him in trouble with every person in the town.  As he falls in and out of apprehending perpetrators, the comedy, which starts out as a tough cop fish out of water, soon morphs into a darker sort.  Several villagers begin to die by gruesome means.  We, of course, know the killer is a robed fanatic, but the other townspeople do not, and they almost succeed in convincing Angel that ""accidents do happen.""  The last quarter of the film is surprisingly bloody and violent, but the delicate balance between comedy and unsettling drama is never obliterated as even the more over the top scenes of gore are presented in such a way that one never crosses the threshhold of real-world mayhem.  Simon Peggie, fresh from his biting success in SHAUN OF THE DEAD, continues to impress as a young man who can handle off beat roles equally well with the best of them.",1185667200,,1382,4.68595041322314
2661050,5,B000IOM9VQ,"This movie is hilarious - a real satire on the whole Bad Boys/ Point Break Comedy action movies. Lots of references to other movies which makes it a fun watch.

It is a tight script, but is enhanced by superb camera work and sound track which brings the whole thing to life. Enhanced sounds make every action dramatic - but the subject is so laughably small that is really stands out.

This is Constable Nicholas Angel, top cop at the Met (London) who is moved out because his arrest rate is 400% more than anyone elses and he is making them all look bad. So he ends up in a tiny village in Gloucester (Sandford) which ahs won best village of the year for many years running. But all is not well in the village, luckily the neighbourhood watch are there keeping an eye on things - meaning Nicholas angel has time to follow up on missing swans in the neighbourhood.

Unfortunately there are a series of murders which the police force there are calling 'accidents' - Angel sees different and tries to investigate only to come up against brick walls. His research reveals a stunningly complicated link between all of them which makes sense - but when he confronts them - the reason is much more banal and it sets up a shoot-it-out, chase-em-down final scene. References to Point Break, every western you have ever watched, and even Matrix movies.

It is hard to describe this movie except to say this is as unique as Guy Ritchies Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is - but in different ways. This is a laugh from start to finish. I will never be able to drinnk decaffinated coffee again without laughing.

This film is simply one of the funniest films in recent years. It's not only the spot on comedic timing with which all the lines are delivered, nor is it the just the way these characters, so absolutely stereotypical and yet, well, absolutely bonkers, are written, nor the plot that, on one side is just about as predictable as you'd expect and yet every so often will put a broad smile on your face saying ""I didn't see that coming"". It's the lot put together.

The amount of details. It's astonishing really. You've got hillarious cameos by Steeve Coogan and Bill Nighy, about a hundred references in dialogue as well as action to films that the writers like and then there's the brilliant use of music throughout the film. Just the right song for the right moment.

On a sidenote I'd like to add, that although I'm not a fan of Timothy Dalton, I must confess that his performance in ""Hot Fuzz"" is brilliant. But then again, all the performances are good. All that coupled together with editing ala Guy Ritchie sort of thing, makes ""Hot Fuzz"", well Hot.

2661084,5,B000IOM9VQ,"There are some who have seen this film and said that it was full of gore, it was repetitive, and much too full of 'that hollywood stuff'. For those who feel this way--I'm afraid you've missed the point.

The point of this film is simply to, in a comedic way, blend the mundane story of an English Policeman, with the over-the-top 'explosions and guts' style of Hollywood; Hence the flower gardens and decapitation.

This isn't a Hugh Grant film- this is an Edgar Wright handmade, Bad Boys II meets Evil Dead II remix, wrapped around the genius of heterosexual life partners, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

It has explosions. It has guts. It has insanely long gun fights. And you know what? It also has one hell of a script; Borrowing from almost every cop movie ever made, it also manages to incorporate the unique quips and inside jokes belonging to Pegg and Wright.

By the power of Grayskull!

POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW

Jokes range from a simple, yet effective 'Yarp', to a lengthy and surprising scene starring one Mr. David Bradley (Mr. Filch to you Potter fans) and one olympic mine.

Have all your buddies make comments and lower my reviewer reliability score - or - hey - make a better film next time. Brilliant.

------------------------------

OK, at first I thought this was a slapstick type comedy, so I was not sure what to expect.  At least - I thought - it would be in the same category as The Full Monty - English humor and great, authentic acting.

But, it looks like the Hollywood influence kept this movie from being as funny and and as entertaining as it could have been.  The acting was okay, but the story should have been the strongest feature.

Instead the producers made it all about the blood and the violence.  And I am not sure if I do not ""get"" the British humor in it, but I think that it could have been funny and witty without all the violence that went on and on and on.....

Again, maybe I just did not ""get it"" but I left the film feeling like it was a bloodgasm - rather than a real film. Have the English stooped that low - to compete with Hollywood?

----------------

Because of the responses, I must update my review.  The film was not funny or meaningful.  Period.  It was not the Full Monty and never will be.

It isn't as non-stop as Shaun of the Dead and there aren't quite as many pop culture references as Spaced- most of them just apply to the police buddy genre.  This, in my humble opinion, is one of the best and funniest movies in 2007- a good plot(which you have to follow and watch closely), good action, and great humor.

2661090,5,B000IOM9VQ,"We are very nearly through the first half of 2007 and I'm happy to report that HOT FUZZ is easily the funniest movie that I have seen so far this year.  I loved Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's previous film, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, and am delighted to report that this is every bit as funny at that one, if not funnier.

The film concerns a highly decorated London police officer who is so good at his job that he is shunted off to an assignment in the country because he is so good he makes the rest of the force look bad.  Sanford would seem to be an impossibly idyllic place, winner several times of the top village in England award.  But it is a town that houses mysteries, which our hero Nick Angel gradually uncovers.  Most of the film should be predictable, but it is a credit to Wright and Pegg that it isn't.  Even the big ending, the week point in most such movies, is a delight.  Despite a lot of action and special effects and explosions it is never taken over by them.  It remains fresh and surprising to the very end.  Although the plot is surprisingly interesting for a comic romp, this would be a fun film without it.  The gags are consistently brilliant throughout and every one is executed marvelously.  This is a much slicker film than SHAUN OF THE DEAD was, though that wasn't in any way unpolished.

The cast is a large one and they manage to bring the village of Sandford to life in convincing fashion.  Pegg is paired with Nick Frost, his costar in SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  The cast is littered with well-known actors such as Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward, Billie Whitelaw, Bill Nighy, Stephen Merchant, and Martin Freeman as well as a rich and varied cast of lesser-known performers.  The great thing about this is that the actors really enhance the film.  What I mean is that the success of SHAUN OF THE DEAD meant that they could hire a cast of better-known performers. Sometimes this can lead to a decline in the quality of projects (watch Robert Rodriguez's EL MARIACHI and DESPERADO back to back and you'll see how a no name cast can free up a director while a big name cast can inhibit one), but that absolutely didn't happen here.

The film is littered with in jokes and cultural references.  There are also a number of references to SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but it isn't important to get any of these to enjoy the movie.  There are also, according to Edgar Wright, a couple of nice cameos, though we have to take his word for it since neither is recognizable.  The crazed Santa that stabs Angel near the beginning of the film is, says Wright, Peter Jackson, while his ex-girlfriend Jeanine is Cate Blanchett.  Again, we have to take his word for it because her entire scene is played with a surgical mask over her face so that all we see are a pair of eyes that do indeed look like they could belong to Cate Blanchett.

As anyone can tell, I loved this movie.  I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone.",1181433600,152,2934,4.412639405204461
2661091,5,B000IOM9VQ,"Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a perfect cop.  So go that he has been transferred from London to the town of Sandford.  He is making them look bad, and they want him out of their hair.  Upon arrival, he brings big city justice to the small town, until his superior, Inspector Frank Butterman (Broadbent) encourages him to relax a bit.  Angel is partnered with the inspector's son, Danny (Frost), an enthusiastic cop who isn't really that good.  He is fascinated with Angel and the stories he shares.  A sudden rash of deaths in Sandford are put off by the inspector as accidents, but Angel fears something more is happening, and feels that Simon Skinner (Dalton), the local grocery store owner, is behind it.  Angel must get to the bottom of what is going on in Sandford, and find out if Skinner really is the bad guy.

""Hot Fuzz"" is an excellent and very funny movie.  Pegg and Frost are hilarious together, playing off each other with ease.  There is a long setup that pays off with a final 30 minutes packed with action.  ""Hot Fuzz"" lampoons the action genre with great skill, and unlike most action movies, there is real character development that makes us care for the duo at the heart of the movie.  Dalton, as the apparent bad guy, seems to be savoring every moment of his screen time.  He is delightfully evil, and about as far from his James Bond days as he has ever been.

The second-best movie was the other time I saw Hot Fuzz.

Yes; I've seen it twice already, and it's so good might make it a third.  (As other reviewers have mentioned, there are lots of puns and such that you might miss the first time through.)

If you are a fan of action flicks or buddy comedies you will like this movie.  Just like Shaun of the Dead spoofed zombie movies, Hot Fuzz spoofs the cop/buddy-flick action movie.

From a technical side of things the sound design and editing are amazing.  The script and delivery of the lines are stellar.  The special effects are incredibly well done.  The choice of camera angles are genius at times.  Sometimes it's to pay homage to another movie, (that helicopter-over-the-head shot - Bad Boys, much?) other times it's their own creativity shining through.

The team that brought you Shaun of the Dead proves that it was not a one-off fluke; they can make good films.  5 friggin' stars for genius and almost making me fall out of my chair from laughing.",1179360000,,1189,4.5
2661104,4,B000IOM9VQ,"****This review may cointain possible spoilers****

I have not seen ""Shaun of the Dead"" and can't compare the two but I am sure that ""Hot Fuzz"" is screamingly funny. The contrast between the first hour of a gentle comedy and the second part with the outrageous twists and turns and bizarre jaw-dropping events is hilarious by itself. The idea of keeping the picturesque sleepy charming village of Sandford the safest and the most perfect place in the country no matter what even if not original was clever. Two main characters, Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, the finest cop London ever seen but could not take for too long and Nick Frost as Danny Butterman, Angel's partner in Sanford, the loyal Sancho Panza to Angel's Don Quixote, are great together because the film took its time to develop their relationship and to make them real and interesting enough to root for them. There are not just the references to and the parodies of the big budget American actions flicks. No, if you look closer, you'll find the homage even to a Woody Allen's film and to the works of John Waters -""Serial Dad"", anyone? The acting is universally good and for me the movie that stars Jim Broadbent, Martin Campbell, Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy and my favorite Mr. 007, Timothy Dalton is definitely worth watching. Oh, I almost forgot - there is a very compelling performance by a swan!

IMO, the creators got a little carried away in the final part and made it a little too long but ""Hot Fuzz"" is still one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time and I don't remember the last time I was laughing in the theater so hard and so loud.",1179014400,,1621,4.56701030927835

2661107,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Officer Nicholas Angel is an over-the-top overachiever on the London police force. In appearance, he looks a bit like Daniel Craig's James Bond. And, like Bond, Angel seems to be master of every skill a person could name - the list of achievements becomes ludicrous after a while. Then we see official recognition and reward for his single minded dedication. The department promotes him to sergeant, and ship him out to a sleepy little village halfway to nowhere. He was making the rest look bad.

The village of Sandford probably hasn't changed since Elizabethan times, and like it that way. It's peopled by enough eccentrics for a brace of britcoms, but utterly peaceful - at first glance. Oh, there are a few alcohol-related incidents, but the Neighborhood Watch turns apoplectic at the first stroke of grafitti or street performer. Then people start dying in bloody ways under bizarre circumstances. And, for some reason, the population and even the police detectives seem happy with any convoluted logic that can explain the deaths away as accidents. But Angel knows there's more --

-- and saying more would say too much. You just have to see the rest for yourself. All the town's weirdness comes to a head, and bursts like a boil of social corruption. It includes the most laugh-out-loud running gun battle I've ever seen. It also satirizes the extremes of small-town pride, which only seems to grow larger as the reasons for pride grow smaller.

Viewers with sensitive stomachs might find some of the mayhem a bit gory. That aside, it's skewed look at stereotypes that deserve to be skewered. After a slightly slow start, it had me rolling. Enjoy!

This film had everything from John Woo double slide side shooting Hong Kong film action, to American pyrotechnics and dry British wit.  True to its zombie gangsta roots, it was hysterical.  I'd see it again in a heartbeat.",1178323200,,281,4.673469387755102
2661109,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, the guys that brought you Shaun of the Dead, bring you Hot Fuzz, a spoof/homage to buddy cop movies. Nicholas Angel (Pegg), the star officer of the London Police Force (actually, he'll tell you the word Service is more politically correct than Force), is being relocated to Sandford, a quiet village that appears to be perfect. He'll be teamed up with an incompetent partner named Danny (played by Nick Frost, also from Shaun). It doesn't take long for things to go sour and pretty soon, after a series of suspicious accidents all leading the victims to their deaths, Angel begins to believe they're dealing with a serial killer.

I'm a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead; must have seen it about twenty times. Wright and Pegg's British humor was brilliant in Shaun and a lot of gags were so well orchestrated that upon repeated viewings, you could spot details in the background or clues in the characters's dialogue that led to punch lines later on in the film. They've managed to accomplish the same caliber of witty humor, long running gags, and escalating hilarity in Hot Fuzz. While not as good as its predecessor, Hot Fuzz builds up to one of the most amazing and hilarious climaxes in recent film history. Let's just say that the twenty-minute showdown at the end of the film gives any action film from recent years a run for its money.

The first half of the film is your average buddy cop action comedy, featuring plenty of references to Point Break and Bad Boys, with a surprising amount of bloody deaths, all done in a comical way, of course. The second half really took things to the next level, transforming an already very funny movie into a whodunit in the tradition of Agatha Christie. All the clues and machinations culminate into a dazzling third act. The supporting cast includes Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge, Gangs of New York) and former 007, Timothy Dalton, who shines as a sleazy large scale store owner. Edgar Wright directs this little gem with the same deft hand as in Shaun of the Dead, using many of his now famous camera tricks.

Kudos to Wright and Pegg for taking a direction such as this; they wrote a very coherent story and succeeded in taking a turn for the unexpected. It's laughs galore in Hot Fuzz, so if you're a fan of Shaun of the Dead or British comedies, you owe it to yourself to see this film.",1178236800,4,2362,4.592417061611374

You need to know that, because some people in the audience were shocked to see several people die in, well, clinical detail, shall we say. When the second half of the movie descended into all out war, many (myself included) were swept away by it. Others, unfortunately, staggered out of the theater a bit ... shell-shocked. Visually smart and filled with winks and homages to other films, this is a fat-free film. Everything's a set up, and everything has a pay-off. So pay attention class!

2661111,4,B000IOM9VQ,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, because - quite frankly - hot is my favorite temperature fuzz.  Plus, I had quite enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead"", whose creative contributors mostly return for this high-powered send-up of action flick conventions.  And ""Hot Fuzz"" delivers, for the most part, on its promise (before the fur starts flying a little too much at the end).

""Shaun"" hero Simon Pegg plays Nick Angel, the too-competent cop whose curve-busting efficacy gets him dispatched (or is that demoted?) to rural enclave Sandford, who take their Village of the Year status VERY seriously.  Once there, things get a little, er, hairy for the fuzz when people start turning up dead under what appear to be accidental circumstances (to everyone but Angel).  Some of these deaths are fairly gruesome, like when the local Romeo turns up decaffeinated (or is that decapitated?) and the Fridge Magnate (heh) gets a little fried after his overindulgence at a local pub.

The ensemble cast seems to be really enjoying themselves on this film, and from the biggest to the smallest of roles, the performances are all fantastic.  Timothy Dalton has a great time hamming it up as the super-smarmy supermarket owner who drops weirdly suspicious and too-overt-to-be-true clues (""my discounts are criminal"") with every other utterance.  And while some of the one-liners fall flat (""we're up to our balls in jugglers"" - groan) and some of the action sequences go on a bit too long, Hot Fuzz is still a satisfyingly satiric romp before it ultimately devolves into the silliness of its three-endings-too-many (which, granted, is yet another send up of an action movie cliche, but I still feel the movie could have been made better by being just a little bit shorter).",1177804800,5,1764,4.976190476190476
2661112,4,B000IOM9VQ,"Sergeant Nicholas Angel is good.  Too good.

These kinds of flicks provide the grist for Edgar Wright's ""Hot Fuzz,"" a movie that takes almost every buddy cop cliche in the book and adds the same dose of wry humor and half-glimpsed sight gags that made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;an equally delicious satire of horror films.

""Fuzz"" has some of the same faces as ""Shaun of the Dead.""  Simon Pegg returns as Angel, a man whose jealous London peers (including acting heavyweights Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, and Steve Coogan) send him packing to the quaint cottage community of Sandford, a village so tweedy and polite that a man's missing swan is big news.  You half expect Sgt. Angel to turn the corner and see locals crafting homemade ranch dressing.

Of course, things aren't exactly as they seem, and that goes double for the town's stellar lack of crime.  Angel, who is incapable of ""turning off"" his brain, joins his partner, the stumbly, bumbly, chummily Danny Butterman (Nick Frost playing, yet again, a man whose brain hardly ever seems to be on) as they work to unravel the mystery behind the town's cobbled, rustic veneer.

It takes awhile, but that's only because ""Hot Fuzz"" doesn't want to leave any cliche unused.  Things get a little ludicrous, but, in spite of its frenetic music video editing and vicious murder scenes, this movie is all about ludicrousness.  The twists and turns are part and parcel for this kind of happy homage, which even gives a nod to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo/dp/B00006HBUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo</a>.  Listen carefully and you'll hear a line that's too close to ""I would've gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids"" to be an accident.

Watch carefully, too.  Wright and Penn have stacked jokes upon jokes, which is a good thing, since the movie appears to have about five different endings, each one more outrageous than the first.  Although things drag a bit near the end, it's the subtle background winks (a set of twins you don't know are twins until the end), the script's subtle finesse (listen and watch for someone named Aaron), and the super-duper subtle cameos (Cate Blanchett who you probably won't recognize, and an uncredited Peter Jackson as a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Santa Claus killer) that really make this flick work, in spite of its sometimes-ridiculous excesses.

Anyway, the kinds of films ""Hot Fuzz"" is riffing off of aren't known for much more than their ridiculous excesses.  And although subtlety is an odd thing to look for in a film that is all about men with guns jumping sideways through the air, you don't need to worry.  There's still plenty of in-your-face action to light up the screen, including a very graphic head crushing, a critical car chase (there's that swan again!), and even a few great, big, chubby fireballs.
