8345771,5,B001V8RT5O,"When I first started to see this play I was like, what the heezy is this? The stage appearance and the way it was set up atrocious, but what got me into the play was the meaning and the message. You have to have an open mind to look past the stage set up and just receive the message the play and the actors are giving to you.
I am sure that that if this play could be done over, they would have a set for each scene. Real stairs that lead up and down. And the stage sectioned better for his and hers individual performances. Never the less I loved the play and enjoyed the singing.
Sometimes we must look past the faults and embrace what the message is sending out to us. Thank you.
I use this play to my group to show that no matter your plans if you want it it can be done and this play writer did her thing. You go girl.",1294790400,4,824,3.9107142857142856
