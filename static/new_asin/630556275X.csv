1047093,4,630556275X,"Yes, I know.  Frank Sinatra made fun of himself in this movie all of his life, but it's still great fun and very light hearted.  The songs are terrific, the color is beautiful, and the feeling is very happy.  Take this movie for what it was intended, and you can have a great time with it.  It was a vehicle for all of what was the new and young talent at MGM.  Kathryn Grayson is beautiful, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse make a delightful trio with a ""new"" Ricardo Montalban, and their dance together is terrific. I really enjoy this sort of movie and believe me, they don't make them like this anymore. It's one of a kind for sure !",1255478400,,632,4.190082644628099
1047094,3,630556275X,"You cant really compare a movie with Frank Sinatra and Kathryn to a movie with Mario Lanza with Kathryn Grayson as they are both very much different. But as this title brought back memories of movies that ive seen as a kid...i was very pleased that i found it and it happens to be kind of funny, filled with adventure, songs and dances.  Nice to see old Franky, refreshenly young and not being too serious. Kathryn and Frank songs are pleasant enough and so is this movie from beginning to end. And ive notice that kathryn grayson has some great close-ups of her face when she is falling in love with Frank....  Lots of color....  a Keeper.",1219708800,2,640,4.452991452991453
1047095,4,630556275X,"Oh my gosh, I'd forgotten how terribly cheesy this movie is - but I love it anyway! Despite it's totally outrageous premise, The Kissing Bandit from MGM is proof in my opinion of that studio's ability to irresistibly gloss and glam up a weak picture with talent, costumes, staging, and color! Supposedly Sinatra viewed this as the worst picture of his career - I think that's a little harsh. I'm still traumatized by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pride-and-the-Passion/dp/B000062XF1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pride and the Passion</a>. :P Sinatra's character here perfectly played up the more innocent side of his persona from the 1940s - he's super sweet, slightly befuddled, and adorably sincere. Anyway, I think The Kissing Bandit would've worked better if the filmmakers had gone for smart parody - like Gene Kelly in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pirate/dp/B00005JNA9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pirate</a>&nbsp;or Danny Kaye in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inspector-General/dp/B0000AGWJ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inspector General</a>. As it is, a lot of potential for parodying the likes of Zorro is lost - but it's still a fun, albeit cheesy and downright silly picture. Kathryn Grayson is lovely as usual, and the specialty dance by Cyd Charisse, Ricardo Montalban, and Ann Miller is marvelous! Though Bandit is far from Sinatra or Grayson's best work, I have a real soft spot in my heart for this film and I'm glad it's finally available on DVD. The DVD is barebones - not even chapter selections - but the picture and sound are great quality.",1213315200,,1716,6.306382978723405
1047096,3,630556275X,"""The Kissing Bandit"" illustrates that even the ""Master"" of film musicals (MGM) could create a mediocre product. Several of the previous reviewers have written that seeing it again brought back happy memories of their childhood - but a young person watching it today will rightfully ask ""What was THAT?"" The strength of the MGM music department is in full display, but the use of its contract players is questionable. And the complete disregard for ethnicity is laughable. I have to give credit to Frank Sinatra for being a ""good sport"" and his natural charm and acting ability. Luckily, he finally ""grew into"" roles that showed him to advantage. As part of the Frank Sinatra Collection, it has value. In ordering this set, I think we all realized that it was a economically priced set (no ""extras,"" no remastering, limited chapters, etc.) so my expectations were not too high. As a musical film collector, I simply wanted to have a DVD copy of the musicals included. But I have a ""bone"" to pick with Warnervideo over the lazy and shoddy work. On the liner notes (which contains the only information for the viewer) it states: ""Ann Miller, Cyd Charisse and Ricardo Montalban sway, swirl and clackety-clack through the vibrant, flamenco-style 'Dance of Fury' number choreographed by Stanley Donen."" Then, as we begin watching the film, in the opening credits, there is a full-screen credit that tells us ""Fiesta Dance Specialty - Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller, Cyd Charisse, created by Robert Alton."" The truth of the matter is that when the studio heads viewed the first cut of the film, they realized that it needed more excitement, color and movement other than the interesting whip dance performed by Sono Osato - choreographed by Mr. Donen. Mr. Donen had gone on to another film assignment so they asked Mr. Alton and the three contract stars to create it. That dance sequence eventually became the most talked-about moment in the film. I hope that for their future ""collections"" Warners asks their liner-note writers to watch the film. I can understand ""economical."" But I do not understand ""shoddy"" and film choreographers deserve more proper - and correct - recognition.",1210809600,,2176,4.980769230769231
1047097,3,630556275X,"Watching this movie for the first time I wasn't really sure of what to expect. But I was plasently suprised to find out how funny and greatly entertaining it was.

 The story begins with a group of unkempt looking bandits awaiting the arrival of there past leaders son to take over the ""family business"". When the son of the Kissing Bandit arrives, they find out that that he is not only a softy from the east, but he thinks he is taking over his father's buisness as inkeeper, and knows nothing of his father's less then honorable career as a bandit. So, making do with what they have, the bandits begin to train him in the ways of his father only to have him fall into blunder after blunder, and in love with the Governor's daughter (Kathryn Grayson).

 Of course you know with such casting as Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, that this has to be a musical. Though there are some good dance profomances, especialy the fiesta dance number feturing Cyd Chirisse, Anne Milller, and Ricardo Montalban, I felt that the songs could have been stronger and more supportive of the story. They seemed to lack a little something to me because they were just inserted into the movie. Not that they weren't nice numbers, but the plot of the story didn't seem to weigh heavy on the shoulders of the preformances. In other words if I had seen the movie without them, I wouldn't have missed them.

 All in all though I would say that this is a great movie, and definitely worth watching. I do think though that this movie could probably be enjoyed more by a viewer that likes musicals anyways apposed to the just any veiwer.",1210723200,,1612,4.52233676975945
1047098,4,630556275X,"This one is by no means a great musical, but is an amiable, entertaing music-comedy from Hollywood's and MGM's Golden Era, produced by the Joe Pasternak Unit (not the more ""artistic"" Freed Unit), which usually produced the musicals which starred such performers as Kathryn Grayson, Jane Powell, Mario Lanza, Esther Williams, June Allyson, Van Johnson, etc.

I first saw this film as a small kiddie on a local TV channel and was highly amused by it, on one of those boring winter afternoons after school (I didn't do my homework, watched this movie instead and I haven't regretted it in over 21 years).

Sinatra stars as the highly-impressionable, shy, mild, bandit of the title, who's unwilling to inherit his father's credits as one of the most notorious rogues of California. Grayson looks very pretty as the Governor's daughter and gets to sing some nice songs. J. Carrol Naish more or less steals the show as Sinatra's mentor and sidekick and Mildred Natwick, as Grayson's aunt, is equally funny. Clinton Sundberg is also quite funny as the Governor's (Mikhail Rasumny) Colonel, who's continually being ""demoted"" by him.

Musical Highest point: The highly energetic dance-ensemble by the great Ann Miller & Cyd Charisse, who ""confront"" each other, over Ricardo Montalban's affections.",1106179200,16,1288,5.15311004784689

1047178,2,630556275X,"This is supposed to be a silly movie with songs, like Danny Kaye's ""Inspector General"". However, this film has none of the plausibility, charm, humor, and cleverness of the ""Inspector General"". You may find some enjoyment in: a few pleasant songs by two great singers; the beautiful, Kathryn Grayson in some pretty dresses, and an opening, on-location scene in the woods. However, Frank and Kathryn never sing any duets; a missed opportunity; and the songs are not so great; you like them only because the singers are exceptional.

I know what you are thinking: ""A musical does not need a good script, because the songs are the appeal"". This is true, but this is not only just not good; it is clear the writer did not care, wrote this in 10-minutes, and had a low IQ. The script says in 10-minutes what could be said in 2-minutes, and you notice. There is no pacing, because there is no plot to get to, and you notice. This movie will leave you frustrated and wondering how a producer could wreck a film with such great talent as Sinatra and Grayson. If money is no object, and you are patient; there are a couple glimpses of great singers.

Kathryn Grayson does some great singing in ""Andy Hardy's Private Secretary"", available only on VHS. Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy show how a musical should be made with some nice duets in ""Maytime"" and ""Naughty Marietta"".",1294617600,,1368,4.672199170124482
1047179,2,630556275X,"What a shame that MGM mistreated a talent like Sinatra.  This is another example of terrible miscasting, terrible plot, and even terrible costumes for him.  I love musicals, so this is not a criticism of the genre.  I just expect something more than this turkey.  This seems like a poor (very poor) cousin to Yolanda and the Thief. At least that movie had a great director (Minnelli), wonderful and creative costumes and settings, and terrific photography.  Even with all that, and Fred Astaire, the movie did poorly at the box office.  I wonder why MGM tried to recycle a failure?",1275696000,,581,4.76

It is beautifully preserved here in several songs like 'Love Is Where You Find It', so you get some Grayson's recordings as well as  Sinatra's and his voice was never better. Although this movie is/was regarded as a stinker, it is kind of fun. Mildred Natwick is here and I've liked her ever since I saw her marvelous performance in 'The Enchanted Cottage' as Mrs. Minute. As Grayson said, The audience did not change, the studios changed. They wanted to make cheap movies and grab the money and run. At least this is a full 100 minutes of song, dance, and color.  Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller, Cyd Charisse do a fine modern dance number too.",1508889600,,766,4.78030303030303
7891471,3,630556275X,"Review of The Kissing Bandit
Hot Toasty Rag, September 14, 2017

Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson are paired together again in this 1940s musical thats a cross between The Mark of Zorro and The Court Jester. After getting an education in Boston, Frankie returns home to California to take over his dead fathers hotel business. J. Carrol Naish, his fathers faithful sidekick, is delighted to have another leader, but when Frankie arrives, they're both disappointed. It turns out, the hotel business was a cover-upFrankies dad was really The Kissing Bandit who kissed women after robbing their stagecoaches. Frankies not a crook or a ladies man, so J. Carrol Naish has his hands full when trying to train the new bandit.

Hidden in this cute and colorful musical are cameos by Mildred Natwick, Cyd Charisse, Ricardo Montalban, and Ann Miller. Yes, its a little campy and corny, but compared to a lot of 1940s silly musicals, this one is pretty cute. There are some funny jokes and cute songs, including Kathryn Graysons Love is Where You Find It. If you're not looking for anything too serious, rent The Kissing Bandit for a fun girls weekend!",1505347200,,1142,4.881443298969073
7891472,2,630556275X,"I think that this film is not funny. It is silly; embarrassingly silly. It seemed to me that the movie studio decided to make money by staring Frank Sinatra even if the film is bad thinking the fans will come as long as he sings. Sinatra was probably embarrassed when he saw it. He does not even look good in the film, and it is crystal clear that whenever there is any action involved, it is done by a stand-in.
It is about the gang of a now dead local famous bandit called the kissing bandit because whenever he and his gang committed a robbery, he would kiss the women, who looked forward to engaging in the event and some even swooned. The gang members are far from smart; they cannot even read, and haven't made a cent since their leaders death. They receive a letter from the kissers son who, thinking his dad was in the hotel business, wrote that he was coming to help. They are surprised to see that not only did he not know the truth about his dad, he was so inept, he could not even ride a horse; he only got off the horse when he was thrown off by the horse.
The following is some of the many sillinesses. The second in command after the kisser is a man with a huge nose. Sinatra is afraid of horses. He joins the band as their leader by standing far away on a mountain top because he is afraid. His horses name is Gonzales. After the gang robs a stage coach, which had no money, but was transporting the local governors daughter, Sinatra is too embarrassed to kiss her, even though he is immediately attracted to her. The daughter is embarrassed that he did not kiss her, and is apparently the only woman he rejected.",1499212800,,1629,4.258064516129032
