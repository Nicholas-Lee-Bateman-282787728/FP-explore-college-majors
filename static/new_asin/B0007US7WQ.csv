12 Beat Ryonan!  Hard training before the decisive game

13 Shohoku vs. Ryonan. The fired up captain!

14 Super basketball match!  Ryonan's attack of angry waves.

15 Hanamichi's nervous big start!

Episodes 11-12 mostly deal with Sakuragi learning some more important basketball skills and getting a chance to bond with Haruko.  Haruko teaches Sakuragi how to perform a lay-up.  While her brother, Captain Akagi teaches Sakuragi about rebounds and their importance in winning a basketball game.

While practicing in the gym Sakuragi meets a mysterious boy.  The boy turns out to be a kid named Hikoichi, a student at Ryonan High school who visits Shohoku to learn more about the players that Ryonan will be competing against during an upcoming practice game.  Initially, Hikoichi mistakes Sakuragi for Rukawa and then Captain Akagi.  Naturally, Sakuragi takes offense to be mistaken for either of the two.

Hikoichi tells Sakuragi about Ryonan's Captain a guy named Uozumi and brags about Ryonan's ace player a guy named Akira Sendoh (one of the coolest anime characters of all time).  Being the kind of guy that he is Sakuragi exaggerates about his basketball skills and tells Hikoichi to make sure that Sendoh shows up for the practice game.

Episodes 13-15 are about the actual practice game between Shohoku and Ryonan.  Akira Sendoh is first introduced by arriving to the gym for the practice game late with a charming smile on his face.  His coach was initially angry about his tardiness, but quickly forgives him for his honesty about being late.  Sendoh then goes on to prove that not only does he have looks, but that he's also a skilled player who provides strong competition for Rukawa and the entire Shohoku basketball team.

The practice game between Shohoku and Ryonan is enjoyable to watch.  The animators did a great job animating the awesome shooting/dunking and playing by Akagi, Sendoh, and Rukawa.  Sakuragi continues his comical antics.  Another bonus to this volumes is that this show continues to be released with five episodes every volume, which is a great value.",1120435200,2,2131,5.042979942693409
