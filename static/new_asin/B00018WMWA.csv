The quality is excellent for the price. Highly recommended for fans of Hitchcock, and fans of old movies and thrillers.",1273104000,2,268,4.604166666666667
8007958,5,B00018WMWA,"Four from Hitch's early British works that are filled with great actors and all those special touches that just say Hitch.

From 1936...""The Secret Agent"". You'll find Hitch's unique sense of humor well integrated with the suspense and his definitive style in this terrific film about espionage at the onset of WWI. A reluctant spy is recruited to kill an enemy spy. He is given a false name and a fake wife to keep up appearances. He goes after the target, but does he have the right man? Could there be another who is the real culprit? And what a cast.. John Gielgud stars with Madeline Carroll, Robert Young and Peter Lorre(fabulous as always) as his very strange accomplice. Other notables to look for include Lilli Palmer and Michael Redgrave.

From 1934..""The Man Who Knew Too Much""(He remade this one in 1956 with Jimmy Stewart). A great thriller about a carefree family on a winter holiday, who unwittingly become involved in an assassination plot. The Lawrences are having a wonderful time, but when their dear friend is shot, he reveals to them a plot to assassinate an important statesman before he dies. The would be killers kidnap the young daughter of the family in order to ensure their silence. Working with the police is out of the question and the Lawrences must take matters into their own hands as they try to rescue their daughter and stop the murder, which is to take place at the glorious Albert Hall.

Hitch keeps the suspense going through out with an edge of your seat climatic scene. Watch for one of his famous trademark staircase scenes in this early film. The film stars Leslie Banks and Edna Best as the Lawrences, and Peter Lorre at his most menacing!

""The Lady Vanishes""(1938)
Of all Hitch's early British made films(mostly made during the late 1920's and 1930's), ""The Lady Vanishes"" is by far the most captivating one for me. A train trip is the setting for this mystery. A woman's traveling companion has disappeared. Where could she be? The train is only so big. She tries desperately to find her friend, but is alone in her quest. No one seems to believe that she even had a companion to start with. All seem to have their own mysterious reasons for denying her any help. Finally one man is convinced to help, and together they try to solve this possible crime.

There are lots of tense sequences to keep you in suspense, and your heart pounding. Hitch mixes up the thrills with his marvelous sense of humor and his wonderful trademark style. Wonderful performances by the likes of Dame Mae Whitty, Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave add to the enjoyment of this one.

Sylvia Sydney, who graced the screen for more than 70 years stars in ""Sabotage"". Younger viewers may remember Miss Sydney as ""Juno"" in Beetlejuice"" or ""Grandma"" in ""Mars Attacks"". If you have never seen any of her earlier works(this one from 1936), you are in for a real treat. In this terrific thriller, she is Mrs. Verloc. A lovely woman who is slowly becoming suspicious of her husband's(Oscar Homolka) strange activities; and with good reason, he is involved in a deadly conspiracy.

It is the eve of WWII, and people in Britain are becoming aware of Nazi activity. Various occurrences of Sabotage seem to be popping up around the cities. Small at first, a black out is the first sign, but when a bomb explodes and kills everyone on a bus, the evidence points to Mr. Verloc. Scotland Yard detective Ted Spencer(John Loder)is on the case and must catch the culprit before he kills again. And of course, along the way falls for the beautiful Mrs. Verloc. Hitch does a great job(as always) at keeping us involved with the characters, the story, and keeping the suspense going. You'll recognize his signature traits all through the film.""Sabotage"" is based on a novel by Joseph Conrad who also wrote ""Heart of Darkness"".

If you love these oldies, you may enjoy his first ""talkie"": Blackmail

Get the popcorn ready for a thrilling time with Hitch
Enjoy and Happy Trails.....Laurie",1231459200,3,3992,4.748917748917749
