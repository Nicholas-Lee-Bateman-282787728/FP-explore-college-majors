Squirrel Nutkin was one of my favorites as a child, but was not part of the collection. I was excited to see this company offering Squirrel  Nutkin and Timmy Tiptoes - even if they were a bit pricey. I was SO disappointed in these videos! I had made my own multimedia file of the story, reading it into a microphone and laying music over it. This made my home made attempt look brilliant - and I paid $14.95 for each one!!!

Save the money. Buy the Peter Rabbit and Friends version for 9 of the stories and read the books to your little ones for the ones that aren't included.",1246060800,,866,5.603053435114504
