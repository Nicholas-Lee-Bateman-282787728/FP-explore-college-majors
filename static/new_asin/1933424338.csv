203253,5,1933424338,"This DVD arrived approx. five days from placing the order. It was packaged well and in excellent condition. If you are interested in prophetic end time events, this DVD expounds on some of what the Bible says about eschatology.",1392163200,3,227,4.846153846153846
203254,5,1933424338,"The information on this DVD has been so awesomely collected and presented that I have seen it with pleasure repeatedly.  The pyramid connection to the end times and its ancient roots in spirituality was absolutely enlightening, as it should be.  Heron's presentation in this documentary/movie shows extensive knowledge of thousands of years of history gathered in only the few short years he had to put it together.  Other teachers on the DVD give great testimony on the subject.  Quite frankly, the best end-times DVD yet.",1168300800,23,523,5.117647058823529

Make sure you are ready, folks.... you don't want to be here on this earth during the tribulation and you don't want to spend the rest of eternity in hell.  It won't be pretty!",1456704000,,211,4.275
203294,5,1933424338,Interesting. I read the Bible so I already know what to look for. But always enjoy different takes.,1456531200,,99,4.555555555555555

203298,1,1933424338,"VERY BAD movie, it give borderline truths about bible prophecies.  If I didn't know the truth I would believe it, this is for Megiddo, Megiddo II, the Rapture and others that talk end times.  It's Biblical misquoting and misinterpretations.",1455580800,7,240,5.128205128205129
203299,4,1933424338,"If someone takes even a few minutes to stand back and look at the world around us, ... and if you have even a basic knowledge of Bible prophecy, then this does a good job of connecting the two. The main problem is prophecy is being fulfilled so rapidly in our life times, that like this video, information can rapidly become outdated. What it does do, that is important, is help to understand why we should be paying attention, and striving to be up to date, and looking for the answer: End Times: How close are we?",1455580800,2,515,4.319587628865979
203300,1,1933424338,Horrible. I only made it 10 minutes in before I had to turn it off,1454544000,,66,3.466666666666667

203302,5,1933424338,"I have believed for years that my generation will be alive to see the rapture, although I can't prove that,the biblical evidence suggests that, and some of these prophecies are shared in this video, and the fulfillment of those prophecies are shown being fullfiled in our lifetime, suggesting we're living in the Times the prophets spoke about, and on my mind confirming my belief that CHRIST could return in my lifetime. This video is a prophetic study that will get the wheels turning, and hopefully revive a urgency to which for JESUS which is what we're supposed to be doing, watching and waiting.",1454112000,5,601,4.844660194174757

203304,5,1933424338,It's pretty interesting. It doesn't  push you to believe pre mid or post rapture but it explains why each group believes what they do.,1453593600,,134,4.583333333333333

203307,4,1933424338,"the Kingdom of God is not a pyramid; it is a palace / castle made out of gold because I have seen it. This presentation is right on many facts but u can repent if u take the mark of the beast written in Revelations God waited for those to repent that took the mark; Jesus also plucks from the lake of fire daily. All hope is not loss. God will not be deprived from having people who want him. The false prophet is the Roman Catholic Pope, and the Beast is the devil. Yes, the pope plans to sign agreements for peace with all of the middle eastern countries including Israel and then rebuild the temple of God and sit on God;s throne. He is already calling him self Father in which Jesus stated in Matthew 23:9 call no man father except God in Heaven.  The pope tries to be the Holy Ghost which is God's Holy spirit sent to man kind after Jesus died as the comforter. So now the pope has clearly taken both spots belonging to God. The pope also gets people to worship angels calling on them for prayers and help. many many blasphemies has the pope persona made against God and also changing God's Holy commandments.",1451692800,3,1114,4.254716981132075
203308,5,1933424338,This video was really interesting. It captured my attention from the very beginning. I like how they stuck to the bible and not just what they thought. Although they did at times give their opinions of what they felt the scriptures meant it was not like they were trying to take the audience on a rollercoaster ride of information. They stuck to what the bible says and presented the information clearly and distinctively. Something to really think about. May God get all the glory.,1449792000,2,482,4.75
203309,4,1933424338,I was very satified. It gave me information that i thought i knew...,1449100800,,68,4.3076923076923075

203331,5,1933424338,This was an excellent presentation of the end times.

Though this documentary did not take a stance, much weight was given to post-tribulation, which I believe is Biblically more credited. Coverage of the pyramids was also interesting. This is my first from that perspective.",1520467200,,336,5.017857142857143

When I opened my first purchased Bible, God spoke to me and said, everything in this book is true. I have been changed from the inside out. Hate is dissappating from my life and being replaced with love and peace.
This movie is true. Very well done. When you make Jesus your LORD, you are accepted by God soley by his grace.
Nothing you need to do! It's so simple!

7801760,2,1933424338,"End Times How Close Are We may be too preachy for some people to identify with. There is a way to talk about God without coming across as self-righteous, boastful, and all knowing. God is not a politician or movie star, so public boasting and bragging isn't going to cut the cake. Showy words designed to flatter God and sincere acts of glorifying Him are two different Arcs. Jesus delivered his gospel without  being preachy, so his disciples should be able to do the same. However, the End Times prophecy about the end of the preaching work makes sense and could be the reason that so many people don't want to hear preachy, self-righteous boasting. I'll pass on End Times How Close Are We.",1499212800,,692,4.580645161290323
