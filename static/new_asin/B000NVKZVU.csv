2786194,3,B000NVKZVU,"The 1940's saw the advent of the first video jukeboxes, actually small film monitors set up at bars, restaurants and other assorted venues. The films produced for these machines were called ""Soundies"". Despite mediocre production values and distracting cutaways, these miniatures provide a fascinating cultural window, as well as glimpses of some of the top jazz and pop performers of the day. This collection brings together a couple of dozen such performances. The problem is the source materials have so deteriorated that, several of the films are either unwatchable or unlistenable. Acorn Media appears not to have done any restoration. And, as far as I know, this stuff is all Public Domain now, so their costs were near nonexistant to begin with. So, if you value your media shekels, be forewarned. Still, if you spot this at your local library as I did, by all means take a gander at a sound and a time long passed and nearly forgotten.",1241913600,18,943,4.9
2786195,4,B000NVKZVU,I'm very pleased with this DVD.  I found it quite informative since it provides a visual of the music during that era.  I've heard about some of the performers. This was an opportunity to see them in action!,1188950400,2,207,4.421052631578948

8181997,5,B000NVKZVU,"There are a lot of great artists,on this dvd beside CAB,if you like blues,jazz,and the big band sounds,this baby is for you. The video's are from machines like jute boxes,that played shorts for 10 cents to a quarter back in the 30,s and 40,s,NO VISA OR MASTER CARDS, like the current jute boxes require,plus you get a video of the whole set.",1422835200,,341,4.516129032258065
8181998,3,B000NVKZVU,"I agree with Randy's review. There are some great film clips here from classic jazz musicians. Just the collection itself is worth a 5-star. There are some nice hip-hop/swingin' dancing that was fun to watch. However, it's the DVD quality that totally brings it down. Yes, these clips should have been restored/remastered AND some background information would have been excellent, such as: date of recording and vocalists names. My question is: What happened to Volume 2?",1408492800,,471,5.2105263157894735
8181999,5,B000NVKZVU,If you are a fan of the great jazz artists of the 40s and 50s this DVD delivers.  Many of these films offer humor beyond the musical performances.  Very entertaining.,1369612800,,166,4.5
8182000,5,B000NVKZVU,"If you're interested in seeing some music legends from a bygone era, buy this. Cab Calloway, Gene Krupa, Lena Horne, Duke Ellington, Louis Jordan and Fats Waller are great as always. But the young Dizzy Gillespie. smiling and leading a band with an un-bent horn (in ""Oo Bop Sh Bam"") is a discovery.

Also, my goodness, The Treniers! Some have called them the first rock n' roll band. They inspired Bill Haley when he was still doing country. They're one of the most dynamic acts I've ever seen, at times slipping briefly into a joyful weirdness I didn't expect. I've been hunting for more clips ever since.

Yes, the quality is iffy, but that's life. Yes, a couple of the acts are pretty stiff. It's still very worthwhile, especially for $9.95.",1357430400,3,744,4.67175572519084
8182001,4,B000NVKZVU,"This is a selection of performances by various groups from the 40s and 50s.  Despite the fact that the films do not appear to have been retouched the quality of both image and sound is very good.  Fats Waller, Louis Jordan, Gene Kruppa and many others are all there.  This is a great DVD if you like the music from that era.",1315958400,,324,4.193548387096774
8182002,5,B000NVKZVU,"I bought this DVD at a bargain store, intending to use it to teach American cultural history.  It certainly is a fascinating and immensely illuminating cultural timepiece that brings to life aspects of American society that the music alone does not so clearly convey.  To see these musicians performing live, and in their prime, adds to my enjoyment of the music.  Given the age of the recordings, I did not expect very much visual or sound quality, but I was very much surprised by how crystal clear both generally are.  I do not understand the review that claims that some selections are almost unwatchable.  I have viewed the video through multiple times, and have been impressed by how clean the visuals are and how clear the music is.  Whether you are interested in the historical significance, or more interested in enjoying great music performed by some of the most gifted musicians of the 20th century, you will be glad if you purchase this DVD.  Cab Calloway and Lena Horne alone are worth the price, but I also was blown away by Fats Waller.",1268956800,18,1051,4.7103825136612025
8182003,5,B000NVKZVU,This DVD contains rare performances by the legends of jazz.  This DVD has a lot of hits from the 1940s and 50s.  This DVD has saved me countless hours of searching for individual DVD's and not to mention how money I've saved as well on such a rare find.,1252108800,4,253,4.142857142857143
8182004,4,B000NVKZVU,"I recently reviewed the work, in his prime in the 1960s, of jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. There I noted that my interest in jazz, as such, was at the many places where jazz and the blues intersect. This volume of jazz- centered music from the big band era of the 1940s is a prime example of that statement. Not all of the twenty plus ""soundies"" (the old time version of MTV-type music videos for the benefit of the younger reader) from the 1940s and early 1950s here derives from the blues but a good number do. The compilers of this DVD have put, in one place at one time, many of the best big bands from that era, including Duke Ellington, Billy Eckstine and Count Basie. The production values on some of the material is not great but you are getting this for its look at cultural history, warts and all.

Moreover, there are two performers who perked my interest from the blues perspective. One was the incredible performances of Mr. Cab Calloway in his classic ""Minnie The Moocher"" and the, well, bluesy ""Blues In The Night"". I last recall seeing old Cab in the original John Belushi ""Blues Brothers"" film from the 1980s. That was nothing compared to these performances in his prime. Watch this. The other outstanding performance here is from Lena Horne. Yes, I know, I am supposed to be true-blue to Ms. Billie Holiday. And I am. Except last year I heard Lena doing ""Stormy Weather"" on a 1940s CD compilation and was blown away. Here on her ""soundie"" ""Unlucky Woman"" she does so again. So call me perfidious, okay.",1250726400,8,1520,4.547445255474453
