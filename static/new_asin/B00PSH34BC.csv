8689085,2,B00PSH34BC,"Being a Petula Clark fan since I was a teenager was my main reason for purchasing this dvd. I was hoping for more of a noirish experience. Republic Pictures apparently spent very little money on this film. A feeling of being done ""on the cheap"" permeates. Petula is fine. The only memorable thing is George Rose as the villain. Prior to this I was mainly aware of his work in musical theater.",1426896000,,392,4.458333333333333
