6185051,3,B00HNGC55M,"There is no denying that Angela Mao has to be credited with the revolutionary feat of being the first female martial artists to have ever graced the screen, and, hence, being the pioneer in that she paved the way for female martial artists to be incorporated into the genre of wushu movies; however, both movies do not measure up to more recent wushu movies produced that features far better martial artists such as Jet Li ad Donnie Yen.",1407196800,,437,4.615384615384615

8633713,5,B00HNGC55M,"The First movie on the disc is Hapkido. Starring a young Angela Mao, Sammo Hung and Carter Wong in one of his first starring roles. They play 3 students who are expelled from their school in Korea and start a kung fu school in China. It is a very good movie and it's action packed. It's in both English and mandarin and it's subtitled in English. With great remastered picture quality and it has interviews with all 3 stars. The second movie is lady whirlwind starring Angela Mao and Chang To. Yi is trying to take on the local mobsters and Mao wants revenge on him for leaving her pregnant sister. Some have stated the picture quality is not as good on this one as it was on Hapkido and their right. But it's still watchable.  Both of these movies have great old school kung fu action. The second movie is in mandarin with English subs. Trailers for both movies are on here.",1497571200,,875,4.368098159509202

8633720,4,B00HNGC55M,"Angela Mao is credited with being one of the all time, great, Kung Fu actresses and and these two films are a good example of why.

The first film, Lady Whirlwind, is a tale of revenge within revenge. In it Angela Mao is out to take revenge for her sister, who committed suicide after being jilted by a man. However, once Mao catches up with him, she discovers that he is also out to get revenge on a group of gambling thugs, that previously tried to kill him. It places her in a tough situation, since she wants to be the person to finish him off. At the same time, she also wants to allow him his day with the gamblers. It creates an unlikely alliance between the two. And to further complicate matters, he has moved on to another woman. Mao comes to feel sympathy for the couple and their situation, while still trying to remind herself of the past wrongs done to her sister.

The second film, Hapkido, is a classic tale of trying to preserve the honor of a Kung Fu School. Carter Wong and Samo Hung also appear as Angela's partners to start a new Kung Fu School. The only problem is, the Japanese have already set up a Karate School in the same city. They look down on the Chinese and Kung Fu in general, and treat the locals poorly. Carter and Angela try to ignore that fact at first, while they attempt to prevail with level heads. But Samo's not about to put up with any harassment by the Japanese. Eventually things come to a head and Angela must battle the Japanese on her own, with some help from her former teacher.

I have to say I really enjoyed these films. Angela Mao has great screen presence, and she shows why she's considered the Kung Fu Queen of the 70s. In lady Whirlwind she has a fierce presence about her, but there's also a slight undertone of compassion in her personality. The fights are also good and the ending is uplifting.

In the second film, Angela doesn't appear as much during the first half. In fact, Samo's character carries the film most of the time, until he's killed off. Carter Wong gets some fight time too. But Hapkido really becomes Angela's film, during the second half. She does a great job once again and comes across more like the champion of the Chinese people. As was the style of many Kung Fu films during that era, the Japanese are painted as the vilians.

Both films are presented in widescreen and have a Mandrian and English language track available. Hapkido is a little more crisp and clear  to look at, but Lady Whirlwind is passable. Both films do have slight issues. In Lady Whirlwind, the film goes out of focus for a few seconds during one of the fights. In Hapkido, the English dub is very mono sounding and appears to have added a few minutes here and there, where the sound is better for a couple of seconds. There are also three separate  interviews included on Hapkido with Carter Wong, Angela Mao and Samo Hung.

In the end, I gave this double feature compilation  a four. You can't go wrong with Angelo Mao. It's also great to see how modern Kung Fu flicks matured over time. But even so, there's only one Angela Mao and this is a great set to add to any Kung Fu collection, especially if you're already a fan of her films.

Highly recommended.",1423267200,3,3212,4.392255892255892
