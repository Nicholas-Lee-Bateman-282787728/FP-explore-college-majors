5375412,3,B00A2H9WW8,"In November 1976, the Stephen King adapted horror flick, Carrie - starring Sissy Spacek, took the box office by storm.  If you look at the box office returns for the film today, they are by no means impressive as the film only earned $33.8 million.  However, don't forget that was back in 1976, and still plenty enough to thrust Carrie towards the top of the list of the highest grossing films of the year.  Not only was Carrie a commercial success, it was also highly praised by fans and critics, and even today is regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made.  You know what that means, right?  It means it was only a matter of time before the studio decided it was time for a remake.  Obviously, remakes are a natural occurrence these days and rarely live up to the originals - especially in the horror genre.  But, Carrie might just be the exception to the rule.

Directed by Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don't Cry, Stop-Loss), Carrie stars Chlo Grace Moretz as Carrie White, a gifted teenage outcast that discovers she has the ability to move objects with her mind.  After an embarrassing incident in the girl's shower room, fellow classmate, Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) attempts to make amends by convincing her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort), to take Carrie to the prom.  However, another fellow classmate, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) is suspended from prom over the shower incident, prompting her to seek revenge against Carrie - in front of everyone at the dance.  Against the wishes of her highly religious mother, Margaret (Julianne Moore), Carrie decides to attend the dance, leading to the most life changing moment in Carrie's life.  Judy Greer, Alex Russell, and Barry Shabaka Henley also star in supporting roles.

To simply say this film is bad because it's nothing more than a repeat of the original is just flat out stupid.  In fact, it's fair to say that this Carrie remake is executed smoother than the original.  Unlike the poor re-imagining of horror classics, like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, Carrie sticks to the same storyline as the original - with slight variations and welcome additions.  If anything, the modifications and additions by screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen make this story even stronger than the original.  For instance, viewers never knew the definite fate of Tommy Ross in the original, so that question is answered for us.  For reasons beyond comprehension, Tommy and Carrie kiss on multiple occasions in the original, even though he's supposedly dating Sue, which is addressed and cleaned-up in the new version.  And finally, a slight elaboration about Carrie's powers is briefly mentioned when she states there are more people in the world like her - a small fact that will no doubt lead to possible sequels.

While I'm personally a fan of Chlo Grace Moretz's acting, largely for her strong portrayal of Hit-Girl in the Kick-Ass films, she's not exactly the best choice for Carrie White.  Sissy Spacek had a much more mysterious, often creepy vibe surrounding her character.  Moretz doesn't feel like an outcast in this film - quite the opposite in fact, to the extent that she could easily be a member of the ""in"" crowd if she would simply loosen up and talk more.  Spacek's version felt like an outcast, clearly struggling to maintain control of the inner hatred that was just looking for an excuse to be unleashed.  Moretz's version just doesn't provide that same inner turmoil.  Even though Moretz is more age appropriate for the role (16 years old), she doesn't seem angry enough.  If anything, she appears to be too happy for her own good.  Even the climactic showdown at the dance feels more like an overreaction than a full-blown emotional meltdown.  In any event, I guess we should all be happy Moretz was cast instead of the previously rumored Lindsay Lohan.  That surely would have been an onscreen and off-screen disaster of Carrie-like proportions.

The supporting cast is mainly lackluster and hardly worth mentioning, but as usual, Julianne Moore stands out (as always) - in the role of Carrie's mother, Margaret White.  In all honesty, has Moore even given a bad performance in her life?  Regardless, she really (forgive the baseball metaphor) knocks this character out of the park.  She's doesn't necessarily appear to be as overly religious as Piper Laurie's portrayal - at least in terms of preaching, but is much more harmful to herself in the name of God.  On several occasions, Moore appears to be on the verge of insanity, especially in one scene where she is beating her head against the wall and also in another scene where she is purposely stabbing herself in the leg.  In a perfect world, Moore's depiction of the character would star alongside Sissy Spacek's portrayal of Carrie.  Now that would actually be the pairing from supernatural Hell.

Overall, Carrie is an enjoyable remake that will bring this masterful story to a new generation.  Obviously, this film is targeted towards a younger film audience, with an emphasis on horror.  Although, horror fans are sure to be disappointed with this effort, since it doesn't provide for one outstanding scare and will likely seem boring in comparison to modern horror flicks, like The Conjuring and Insidious.  At times, this story feels sadly outdated, which is what made the original film popular in the first place.  Sure, this new film cleans up a bunch of small nuances that felt out of place in the 1976 version.  On the other hand, there's no such thing as a perfect film and the die-hard lovers of the original won't like the fact that some things are changed (although many lines are still the same) - even if they do make more sense.  For me, this reworked story is much cleaner and more elaborate, making for a better film experience, especially if you've never seen the original.  Still, it's impossible to give a remake a score that's any higher than average.  After all, it's really nothing more than a blatant copy.

5375454,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Julianne Moore is the epitome of an actress who can own any role put in front of her, and she is my undisputed favorite actress, but they didn't give her much script to work with, so she was underutilized. The young actors/actresses in the movie all did a remarkable job especially given that most are without tremendous experience. It's Stephen King so it's worth a watch (again), but the young leading male character ""Tommy Ross"" played by Ansel Elgort is phenomenal.",1507593600,,469,4.802469135802469

I believe there is documentation about the phenomenon, showing that at the onset of puberty, the ability to move things with one's mind appears in some people. There have been TV documentaries also about this. It's pretty common apparently.

5375461,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Released in 2013 and directed by Kimberly Peirce from Stephen Kings novel, ""Carrie"" stars Chlo Grace Moretz as the titular teen misfit whose hyper-legalistic mother is mentally disturbed and abusive (Julianne Moore). A compassionate teacher (Judy Greer) and two teens (Gabriella Wilde & Ansel Elgort) try to help Carrie while her nemesis (Portia Doubleday) organizes a cruel prank for the prom, where all hell breaks loose.

In ways, this is a competent remake and I generally prefer Chlo in the eponymous roll, whos surprisingly up to the task, although Spacek was more effective in the harrowing prom sequence. Unfortunately, this version is less realistic and feels like it's in a rush. The 1976 film took the low-key, slow-build approach and it made the prom scene so potent and iconic. In this remake the psychokinesis elements are so amped up they (1.) ruin the build-up and (2.) are sometimes so overdone I busted out laughing, like the crucifixion scene. A horror story like this takes skill to pull off with a straight face and the 76 version fully succeeded and is even a work of art whereas this rendering is less aesthetically pleasing and sometimes verges on being a parody. Also, other than Chlo, the 76 film has better women.

However, there are some things in this remake that are well executed and even superior, like (1.) how it is emphasized that the abusive mothers interpretation of the bible is seriously askew, (2.) that Tommy boldly supports Carrie and clearly enjoyed taking her to the prom, (3.) that this Carrie (the girl) is a stronger person than the way Spaceks character was written in the original and (4.) the dramatic parts are generally more compelling.

Final Word: While this rendition is worth checking out for the positives noted above, overall it pales in comparison to the original and the excellent 1999 sequel, The Rage: Carrie 2.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Ontario, Canada.

5375462,3,B00A2H9WW8,It's ok. I liked it better than I thought I would but it's still not as good as the original. Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek are hard to beat. Most of what I had a problem with was the over the top telekinetic scenes with a lot of CGI and some of the acting. Betty Buckley did a better portrayal of the gym teach in the original I think than Judy Greer did in this one because she came across as firmer in her actions with the bullies. Judy Greer comes across as more passive aggressive. Another detail that bothered me is that everyone in the movie is beautiful even outcast Carrie. It didn't seem like they even tried to make her less attractive than her peers. If you've not seen Carrie I recommend the original as it's way better. The final scene of the original has the ending scene of this movie beat by miles. The ending to this movie fell completely flat. There's a reason Stephen King himself said he felt there was no reason to remake Carrie as it had been done so well the first time. I agree with him. For the most part this remake is more of a time killer than anything.,1496707200,4,1082,4.206730769230769

5375571,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Not a bad movie. But, just pointless. Every way this movie departs from the original is mostly not an improvement.  I am presuming familiarity with the original movie. Carrie White is just an unfortunate girl teased by her classmates for being a little different. Her mom is a religious nut and Carrie bears the hate of that and is horridly teased.  This version however suffers from a quite good looking lead so it is hard to really buy that she would be so attacked. In addition the original way Carrie is filmed as she loses it at the prom is sort of a masterpiece. Here it is done like ""Twister"" and quite lame. Carrie does a lot of lifting of the arms but it just looks staged and silly.

This version does make a few changes that I happened to like. Never reading the book I don't know if this was in there but in the original movie it never made sense that Sue Snell gave up her Senior Prom and made her boyfriend go with Carrie. This version gives a good reason why Sue would maybe not want to go to prom with a dress she might have picked out and had fitted a few months before, if you catch my meaning.  Also, in the original movie the teacher who had been so kind to Carrie was killed by her. Chilling and probably accurate but in this one she gets to survive.

If it is on tv anyway, watch but, yet another reason re-imagining of films with nothing wrong with them doesn't work.",1463184000,,1390,4.25

5375824,4,B00A2H9WW8,"This movie is not too bad when taken as a tribute to the original as well as a special-effects update. As far as the story, it really doesn't offer much more than what De Palma presented. Many of the scenes and much of the dialogue match up very closely with his film, so really, this isn't much more than the equivalent of a band doing a faithful cover tune. The acting from the main characters ranges from good to great. Chloe Grace Moretz is no Sissy Spacek, and doesn't seem to have the emotional depth to reach the same terrifying places as Spacek, but she gives a determined performance and in no way does a bad job. Similarly, Julianne Moore is no Piper Laurie, but man can that woman act. She doesn't disappoint, portraying Carrie's lunatic religious zealot mother in disturbing fashion. The greatness weakness of the movie comes from the ensemble cast, with forgettable performances of main characters like Sue Snell, Tommy Ross, and Billy Nolan, and a horribly over-acted rendition of Chris Hargenson. The only co-star who shines is Judy Greer as the gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin. The movie's strengths are its oppressive tone, especially some of the soundtrack/sound effect choices, its updating to show the modern phenomenon of cyber-bullying, the spectacularly horrifying prom climax, and the overall excellence of the special-effects, in particular the gruesome demise of Carrie's nemesis Chris. The prom disaster in particular is not only massively apocalyptic, but also down-to-the-bone creepy with Moretz's take on Carrie's physicality. Even though it will never replace Brian De Palma's 1976 classic, the 2013 Carrie re-make should please most fans of his movie and Stephen King's novel, as well as a newer generation of horror fans for whom the '76 version might seem just a tad dated.

5375852,3,B00A2H9WW8,"The director claimed that Carrie (2013) that the remake would be A LOT truer to the original Stephen King novel than the 1976 original. That's the most ironic thing because she actually took a lot of elements from Brian DePalma's original and put it in her remake. However, I did appreciate that they modernized Carrie to bring school bullying to attention to teenagers (such as Chris Hargensen filming Carrie during the shower scene on her iPhone and uploading it to Youtube). Another good part of this movie was the prom destruction; it was a lot more graphic and quick-paced than the original. In the novel, Carrie White's rampage didn't stop at the prom; she totally destroyed her small coastal town with her powers. This did not happen in this 2013 remake. Carrie went straight home after killing off Chris and her boyfriend - just like the original.

  I have to applaud Chloe Grace Moretz's performance as Carrie. Finally an actress that was the same age as the character! This film actually featured teenagers and not 30-year-olds like the 1976 original did. Chloe did an amazing job, and in my opinion she played Carrie the best (out of Sissy Spacek and Angela Bettis). Great acting, but flat plot. 3/5 stars.",1450483200,,1218,4.818181818181818

I will say this movie is good for the younger generation, it also added some prolonged death scenes, which you didn't get in the original, but, did get in the 2002 version, as well as this one. This version has Carrie being more "" normal"" you find it hard to see the reasons the girls are picking on her, besides the classic ""period problems"". I feel they explained why they hated her more in other versions, this one just seemed too ""mean girls meets the heathers meets Carrie"" ... UGH. (i liked the heathers waaaay more than mean girls, so this is probably why i'm containing myself) Chloe does the best she can with a role that has been done twice before, i think her or the directors wanted a more ""floaty Carrie"" which is bothersome, because who wouldn't want to be friends with her? The Ballet of blood, aka the prom, is more choreographed than it should have been, it left me feeling let down, the endings of Carrie have always been gritty, raw and emotional (with carrie having a lack of emotions). It felt too polished, too cleaned up, and yet still aiming at the ""SHOCK VALUE""...which left me tilting my head and questioning why i bothered. All in all, The First Carrie with Sissy was the best. Followed by Angela Bettis as Carrie, Followed by ""The Rage"" and in last place, this.

5375918,3,B00A2H9WW8,"What I respect about this film is that they tell it knowing that their viewers (most of them at least) know the story, and thus they don't try to slowly build up the mysterious reveal of Carrie's powers.  You get to see examples of them right away, and you get to see more of her mom's earlier life to help support the ""crazy"".  I respect that while Carrie is very timid as her character is meant to be - a result of an overbearing and religious zealot of a mother - she breaks out of her naivete.  One thing viewers hate is when their protagonist doesn't ask the logical questions, but you get to see Carrie doing a bit of that when she second-guesses the intentions of people around her, when she tells her mom how something she said is terrible.  You get to see Carrie exploring her powers and relishing in them, and the director isn't trying to tease you with a slow reveal of them as if you have no idea what could possibly be happening.

The problem with the movie are its extreme caricatures and some overly dramatic scenes like the initial bathroom scene, the miss-drama-queen training session where coach suspends the antagonist. I dunno... I know their purpose is to make it clear that Carrie has justifications for freaking out at the end and the mean kids really get what's coming to them, but IMO a director who can delicately straddle the line between drama and melodrama is what makes a horror movie go from ""Meh, Okay"" to ""Awesome"", and that line is probably the hardest to walk in a gory horror movie.

Chloe Grace Moritz sheds a lot of the painful timidity and utter naivete of Sissy Spacek's potrayal, but there are parts in the end when she's just doing this overly maniacal heaving thing when she wields her powers.  Chloe/Carrie can't decide if she's going to be plain old dumbly naive or more bold and assertive. In one scene she's looking around the room with this scared pout on her face like she's not even sure how she got there, and in the next she's just a normal teenager and the next as a blood-thirsty super villian.

Directing, acting, I dunno, but it just misses the mark.

So, in conclusion: this movie had a lot of potential and succeeded at being a fresh exploration of an old story with respect to addressing a few things the viewer might otherwise criticize seeing as how we love to be cynics, but it falls a bit flat in the execution and I think I can mostly blame that on a lot of the over-acting and some odd directing choices.  It just can't seem to find the sweet spot.

It's as if we knew pretty much everything we needed to know in the first few scenes. (Even if  you knew nothing about the original). I know the film followed the original to a large extent, but it still failed miserably.

The only good thing is that it didn't cost very much. Usually if I buy something to complete a collection, I keep it, even if it doesn't meet my expectations. However, this one went straight to the trash. My Carrie DVD will remain a lone movie.",1436572800,,781,4.416666666666667

Good in its own way, this version just felt more like I watched the origin tale of an as yet undiscovered mutant in another bunk Brian Singer X-Men film; it felt very little like the original. Certain parts are retained (dirty pillows, they're all going to laugh at you, blah blah blah...) But in the end, after Carrie basically becomes the Dark Phoenix, I was left wondering why Rob Zombie decided to make it cool to butcher horror classics. I know, he didn't so this. Still, sometimes you hear a song that reminds you how much Ace Of Bass sucks, even if the song isn't by Ace Of Bass. Three stars because I didn't have to pay for it. Thank you, Amazon Prime. Otherwise it would have been two stars.

Sometimes these types of stories need to be updated with modern clothes, technology, etc. because younger people don't want to watch an ""old"" movie. This was done with skill, and all the important elements are here- the mentally disturbed mother, the ""plug it up"" harassment scene in the locker room, the fantasy prom, and the bucket of pig's blood, all with an anti-bullying message. It isn't considered scary by today's teens' standards. They've seen much creepier stuff than this. But if they've never read or seen the Carrie story before, start them with this one. It will seem the least dated.

5376007,4,B00A2H9WW8,"Although the film is predictable to anyone who has spent countless seasons watching the classic film, or re-reading the story by Mr. King,  Chlo Grace Moretz portrays the telekinetic school girl with more charm and depth. Sissy Spacek  offers a more vulnerable, sorrowful Carrie and I enjoy her version immensely. I just feel that Moretz interpretation is more attuned to that outcast, sheltered, mentally scared character. I felt invested enough to stay connected through the parts of the film that almost seemed redundant and too close to the 1976 film.

The film moves in that same somber slow atmospheric realm of depressed soul  as the original and the characters are critically close to being two dimensional but the depth and breadth of Kimberly Pierces vision of Carrie offers so much more substance to the story on screen that it carries the characters from scene to scene. However disappointing the lack of personality the characters seem to have in the first half of the film second and last act the energy and chilling vitality begins to shine through elevating Carrie into a more visceral, macabre film. The characters become more affective and viable, especially in the last act when things really start moving.

Visually it all boils down to the effects and dark realization of Carries breakdown into an uncontrollable storm of death and destruction. Pierce offers more detail to the personal growth of Carrie and more celebration of the carnage the ensues.

5376024,5,B00A2H9WW8,"I recently re-read the novel after watching this film and have to say some of the things I thought the movie got wrong, I actually as a viewer did. I had thought Chloe Moretz should have been uglified up a bit, as she was just too attractive to really plausibly be the social reject that was Carrie White, as surely at least the guys would have been nice to her.  But the book actually does mention that Carrie was seen as attractive by Tommy and others at the prom once she'd put the effort into and ignored her mothers demands not to make herself look nice.  Although the book does also have the P E teacher compare her to a cow and later a gorilla in the shower scenes at the start, so perhaps uglifying her up a bit should have happened before the prom but they pretty much nailed it once she decided to transform herself and go.

The movie obviously made the P E teacher a nicer more caring person who was outraged at what happened in the shower stall whereas the book the teacher looked at Carrie the same way and only stepped in as her job sort of required her to.  The dirty pillows line seemed sort of forced to be a forced inclusion in the movie and had a lot more impact in the book where it was often mentioned, including a young childhood scene with a neighbour sunbaking in the backyard where Carrie's power to destroy and punish was first noticed by an outsider. Sue Snell of course never went to the prom in the book either and the post bucket scenes are a lot different too but overall this isn't a bad telling of the book's story.",1430697600,,1548,4.255102040816326

We all know we're waiting for the prom scene at the end of the movie, and yet for some reason the makers of this version didn't do it right at all.  The prom scene in this version is short, cartoonish, and watered down to the point of being boring.  The more you watch the more disappointed you become.  The way they kill off the nasty teens is a snooze, and the way Carrie's mother dies is also cheap and lame.  Though the movie was true to the original most of the way through, then end makes you regret wasting the last hour of you life.  Save yourself the disappointment and just watch the original.",1430524800,3,879,4.284848484848485

5376036,1,B00A2H9WW8,"A ""cleaner"", uninteresting and overall unnecessary remake of the far superior original.  Like most modern movies & remakes, they replaced the original cast with more attractive people, removed all of their character, blemishes & scars to give us a shellacked, boring version of the original Carrie.  God forbid anyone is flawed or not gorgeous in the telling of a tormented high school female.  And Chlo Grace Moretz portrayal of Carrie, isn't even THAT tormented in this movie!  There is one incident in the infamous shower scene, and the rest of the movie, everyone is trying to make life easier & better for her as a result of that ONE incident.  There is only ONE mean girl that is trying to ruin her life, and she's more of an outcast than Carrie...  Ugh...

There are plenty of modern day examples of how a teen girl could struggle in the high school environment--and this one chooses none of those far more interesting paths in order to not offend anyone.  If you love to see unimaginative, watered-down version of far superior original films, then THIS is the movie for you!

5376139,4,B00A2H9WW8,"Carrie was originally planned for release on March 15, 2013, but it was rightfully postponed because it deserved the label for the Halloween movie of the year. The story focuses on a teenager who has been abused by her classmates and the only person she loves, her mother.

As the movie crawls through its slow-paced beginning, viewers can see the fear and trauma in Carries eyes as her classmates bully her in the worst way imaginable for a teenage girl. When Carrie returns home, we expect a loving parent to comfort her, but instead we learn that the main evil in the movie is her bigoted, religious extremist mother, Margaret. Soon after, Carrie discovers that she has paranormal powers, including the ability to move objects with her mind.

Assuming too quickly that we are familiar with Kings novel, the movie suffers from a slow-paced first half without details about the lives of side characters. However, Chlo Grace Moretz (as the title character) and Julianne Moore (as her mother, Margaret) give brilliant performances that raise the bar for a remake of a classic horror movie.

The movie lacks dialogue between Carrie and Margaret. Instead, emotions take center stage. Carrie and her mother wordlessly convey their tension through, for instance, the look on Margarets face when Carrie joyfully tells her that she has been asked to prom, or when Carrie begs her mother for forgiveness so that she won't spend another day locked in her closet.

During the second half of the movie, its nearly impossible to blink or breathe, as a flawless combination of CGI and thriller fills the screen. The action of the notoriously bloody prom scene makes up for the slower opening scenes.

Although I haven't seen the original 1976 film, I enjoyed the remake. When I asked my friend to compare this remake to the original, I wasn't surprised to hear that she felt the original movie seemed old enough to deserve a modern remake, and the remake was nothing short of satisfying and even better than what she expected.

5376153,3,B00A2H9WW8,"I am a fan of the original 1976 version of Carrie and while this remake is not all that bad, the Carrie( Chloe Moretz) in this remake is not necessarily the outcast, vulnerable, fragile girl that was present in the original. Sissy Spacek's character seemed more genuine and authentic, more like a girl who was truly vulnerable, uncertain, indecisive and reluctant to use her powers. I felt genuine, heart felt sympathy for Sissy Spacek's character and felt myself almost routing for her when she exacted vengeance on her fellow classmates. Piper Laurie, who played Carrie's mom in the original, had such a creepy presence that she literally didn't have to say a word before I felt some kind of chill at the site of her in the movie. I know some may feel it's unfair to compare this to the original version, but this is the inevitable barometer that this movie will be measured by.",1423267200,2,880,4.683870967741935

5376160,5,B00A2H9WW8,I love this movie. Some people keep comparing it to the original and the book. There will always be a few differences. You cant expect for things to be exactly the same from line to line because  that would be boring. This follows alot of the same but there are differences. Obviously  same plot. On another note it is spectacular  to watch. I recommend it 100% unless your one of those exactly like the book Nazis who are not pleased  with anything unless its what there imagination thinks it should be. Other than that its a very good movie.,1422316800,,543,4.454545454545454

5376329,5,B00A2H9WW8,"So after having been one of Stephen King's best novels, been made into a hugely successful 1976 movie, which spawned a pretty decent and rather under-rated sequel in early 2000s The Rage: Carrie II; then having been remade into an outstanding and hugely under-rated 2002 two-part tv movie, was there really anywhere left to go with the Carrie concept?  At one point I would have said no, if there's going to be another King movie let it be from one of his novels or stories that hasn't been adapted yet.  But the promos for the latest incarnation of Carrie looked good, and anyway I'll give just about any horror movie a chance.  It leads to some duds but it also leads to movies that you never would have expected to be as good as they are.  So while my expectations for the 2013 Carrie were not rock bottom, they initially weren't sky high though.  When I actually saw it I was blown away.

In my opinion this may just be the best of all the  versions, and that's saying a lot.  It doesn't totally re-invent the story from new angles, but everything it does it does so freaking well that I wouldn't change a thing.  And the ways in which it is different, while subtle, are significant.

The basic story is by now pretty universally known.  Carrie White, secretly a telekinetic, lives a hellish life tormented at school by boorish classmates and at home by a fanatical mother.  At the year's big prom, she's finally pushed too far, with catastrophic results.  Many of the differences involve Carrie's antagonists.  In this one, the whole angle with the kids at school is more that there's a small number of true scumbags, but most of the rest involved with her torment kind of just got caught up with the ringleaders's egging on, and as soon as it's done with and anybody has a chance to actually use a braincell, are left thinking ""Oh crap, that really was pretty rotten"" and feel bad about it.  The character of Sue Snell feels better developed and more genuine this time around.  In previous tellings of the story it didn't quite feel authentic how after the incident is over, Sue turns around and becomes Carrie's champion, even arranging for her boyfriend to ask Carrie to the prom as part of her drive to make up for her earlier actions, and to try and get social outcast Carrie involved in things.  However, even with most (certainly not all) of the other students seeming not as evil this time around, you can still see perfectly how Carrie is so scared, so mixed up with repression and guilt derived from her mother's fanaticism where EVERYTHING is a sin, and so traumatized by her twin desires to just be left alone on one hand and wanting to fit in and actually have friends on the other hand, how the situation looks to her.  She really does feel alone and thinks pretty much everybody hates her, and after Sue has nudged Carrie along with some of the other kids, it gets to the to the point where she suddenly feels ""Oh wow, I'm NOT alone, some of the others even Like me"".  And when the pivotal Incident happens at the prom you see why she thinks it was all a cruel plot all along with everybody involved, not just a few who decide to take her torments to a new level that night, and that shatters her psyche much more after it had started to heal than if she'd never developed a hope that things were changing for her.

Carrie herself is depicted as a gentle, highly intelligent person underneath the scars of her mental instability and ill treatment.  Chloe Grace Moretz's potrayal of the character is one of several award-worthy performances in the film, and you see a whole array of different emotional states in Carrie - sometimes very innocent and even highly childlike, sometimes very very lonely and terrified of everything (including herself), sometimes with a dawning confidence that shows how she may have been without so much emotional trauma, and after she finally is pushed too far, just - just Totally shattering on so many levels and losing control.  The movie is an epic tragedy as well as a killer horror movie, and even Carrie's mother, despite how warped she is, is this time around a character we pity more than hate.  I've already said more about what goes on in the latter portions of the movie than I usually do in a writeup (I felt it wasn't really spoilers since you see so much of those parts just in the trailer) so I think I'm going to wrap up now.  Bottom line - this is a must-see for horror fans, and if you've been avoiding this one because it's ""already been done"" you should really give it a chance anyway.  This is a remake that justifies its existance through sheer excellence.",1419033600,2,4629,4.528211284513805

The reason so many won't admit that is because of the first film being the Holy Grail in many peoples eyes. Why is this movie just as good? Extremely talented actors (especially Moretz as Carrie, sublime casting, she's the future of Hollywood), Julianne Moore bringing even more depth to the role of Carrie's mother and an excellent side cast. What I felt really succeeded in this film is that it's truly a female centered film, about female sexuality, becoming mature, female bullying and having a primarily female cast with a female director gave this film a lot of heft in my eyes.

5376384,3,B00A2H9WW8,"This movie follows almost exactly to the original. If someone hasn't seen ""Carrie"" the original, then show them this as it will fit into today's modern times.
The movie almost feels like some school putting on a play of ""Carrie"", but then added their own flare to the end to make it theirs. It excruciatingly follows the original script to where you are bored at certain points. I love this story and the original movie, but now I see why certain films go so far away from the original script; this is again, why I say to show people this newer version, so they won't be thirty minutes in saying ""What's the point?!""
However, let us go over why this movie is completely breath-taking and quite thrilling over the original. Chloe Grace Moretz gives a great play as Carrie White. She gives Carrie a little more say and sway than Sissy Spacek did. Now, this isn't an insult to Mrs. Spacek, I love her. This Chloe-Carrie simply had more brass instead of Sissy-Carrie. Now, the problem I do have with Chloe, which is what subsequently made me drop my rating down from 4 to 3 stars is this: Sissy played a weak and frail Carrie. She was pretty, but not Hollywood hot. She was awkward and innocent. They kept Chloe as herself, which is beautiful and cute. There isn't anything that would entail her as being ""weird"" other than her mother's forced Christianity. So it's really hard to see Chloe as wounded, whereas Sissy nailed the part. Sissy made you believe Carrie was a wounded, neglected, and lost young woman.
The supporting teen cast looks almost too good. They look like they stepped off the silver screen with fabulous attire and quaffed hair and stepped into a local high school.
When the prom happens, Chloe-Carrie REALLY comes alive and takes the power to full capacity in ways that are truly spellbinding. She commands the attention of the audience and doesn't let it go, even unto the end.
Julianne Moore did something I didn't think was possible: she made Carrie's mother way more sadistic. They even gave her a nervous tick (no spoilers) that the original didn't have. It really makes you see just how far down the black hole of self-hate and religious-loathing she really was. What she does in the beginning scene alone will make you want to puke or stop watching in protest. So much so, that I couldn't get Ms. White out of my head when I saw her as Alma Coin in ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay."" Very well done, madame.
I'd say this film is definitely good, just not great. The setbacks are how much it sticks to the original. unrealistically good looking teens, and a Chloe-Carrie that never really makes us believe she is wounded, just smothered and picked on.
I had originally gushed over this movie, but upon re-watching the first, I had to come back and alter this. I recommend seeing it, but except for the last thirty minutes or so, there really is no point in rushing out to buy it.",1417305600,,2899,4.5876685934489405

5376420,5,B00A2H9WW8,"This new version of CARRIE had quite a bit to prove, w/ two strikes against any such production from the start. Strike one: The classic Stephen King novel. Strike two: The classic 1976 film by Brian DePalma. Still, in spite of these intimidating factors, CARRIE 2013 succeeds admirably. First off, Chloe Grace Moretz (LET ME IN, DARK SHADOWS) underplays the title role, rather than risking some sort of cynical parody of the character. Secondly, Julianne Moore (HANNIBAL, THE BIG LEBOWSKI) portrays Carrie's hyper-religious mother, Margaret, w/ just the right mixture of menace and pitiable psychosis. The rest of the cast is also well-realized, w/ the eeevil Chris Hargenson (Portia Doubleday), conscience-plagued Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde), and good-natured Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) being the most memorable. This is a combination remake / re-imagining, and homage film. It scores very highly in both categories, containing familiar scenes as well as those unique to this rendition. Of course, the essential sequences- Carrie's first period, the catastrophic prom, and the final encounter w/ her mother- are left intact. CARRIE 2013 stands as a tremendous example of how to remake a movie without making a pig's breakfast of it! Highly recommended...",1416614400,2,1254,5.403061224489796
5376421,5,B00A2H9WW8,"A decent reboot with a few modern day touches.  I am a Carrie fan, I loved the original from the off her rocker mother to the fantastic and spooky yet misunderstood performance that Sissy Spacek delivered so I was not sure how this would pan out.....and I am glad I gave it a shot.  The story gives a little more insight into the characters including the demented mother played so well by Julianne Moore you see her giving birth while the whole time she thought she was dieing of cancer. We get to see how the gym teacher and the principle rounded around Carrie while she was being mistreated by the kids. We get Sue Snell who was around in the original movie really have a bigger role and more interaction here trying to stop the prom and then approaching Carrie at the end.
One of the things that was kinda cool was that in this version Carrie did research on the internet about her telekinesis and she practiced it and almost perfected it.  We got to see her levitate things and get a feel for her abilities and show her mother what she could do.
One of the things I did not like was the prom sequence... it seemed so quickly thrown together and much more fake than in the original in that version it seemed like they took the time to set it up and that is when the movie in my opinion really took on a life of its own.
All in all it showed a much more softer Carrie here and you saw more sympathetic people around with that being said I would def recommend it.  If nothing else see it for a dynamite Julianne Moore who steals the movie with her paranoid, sick mother.",1416614400,2,1571,4.2441471571906355
5376422,5,B00A2H9WW8,"I love the original Carrie and this to, it pretty much sticks to the original version only with a few modern tweaks and new additions added lets call it a modern day make over of a film classic. Only in this killer version Carrie has a way higher level of telikenetic power she can choke someone to death by shear will, levitate her mother and hold her up in mid air creepy and make her lips stay closed rendering her unable to speak

For all who've seen the original we all know that Chris the bad girl/????? is mercilessly on Carrie's case. When in the school shower room one day taking a shower already in pain Carrie starts bleeding thinking she is dying she panics and starts screaming for help, Chris and her minions throw tampons and kotex pads at Carrie as a joke

The teacher takes the frightened girl aside and tells her that she has begun her first period of course Carrie's religious fanatic mother never told her all women get it and and says it is a curse sent down from god as punishment for sin. Chris the bullies ring leader films the shower room event with her cell phone, ah but that's enough for her nope Chris uploads the video and puts it on the internet this is one of the new things added to the original plot

Though Sue is one of the girls who threw tampons at Carrie she is geniunly sorry and regrets it so in an attempt to make amends asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom so that Carrie can have a good time which would be for the first time in her life, as planned Tommy asks Carrie to the prom. Meanwhile Chris aka the school pain in the ??? and her delinquent boyfriend make plans to rig it so Carrie and Tommy are elected king and queen of the prom and rig it so that when the pair go up on stage to be crowned king and queen Carrie will be drenched with pigs blood from a bucket they rigged above the stage

In this remake Carrie can levitate up off the ground and hover in mid air. All of the new things added to the original make the classic even scarier than it already was. Julienne Moore does an exceptional job playing Carrie's mom Misses White and is genuinely creepy in her role as the brutal and overly religious tyrant. All of the actors in this movie gave exceptional performances and played their parts to perfection. When you first see Julienne Moore you will barely recognize her they really did a good job making her look like a plain jane.

The shocking ending was deleted on this remake ( too bad). You need to be carefully when you want to do a new version of a timeless classic , there are some particular points in the movie that you want to see again to see if the new version can blow your mind. The only two things that were interesting in the movie , was the birth of Carrie at the beginning of the movie  , that explain the strange  relation between Carrie and her mother. The other thing was Carrie's mother character, was very well done and  different from the original movie ,  you can see in her the real pain and motivation to keep Carrie very close to her in a sick way.

Her onscreen chemistry with Ansel Elgort (who also deserves praise for his great acting here) felt genuine and touching and I sympathized with Carrie's situation. Julianne Moore plays Margaret Moore well and her presence onscreen kept me nervous and on edge. In fact everyone in the movie played solid roles. The special effects were pleasant to the eye and did not look artificial which impressed. I love musical scores for movies and this one did not disappoint.

The acting isn't bad.  I thought Chloe Moritz and Julianne Moore did a good job, as did Judy Greer.

SO much has been lost in this cheap version of the original classic like the ending is 100% disappointing...is that ending really the best that the remake people can offer?  Also, anyone who watched the original can appreciate the excellent and suspenseful background music (there is none in the remake).

Chloe Moretz is a fantastic young actress and Julianne Moore always brings her A game. This film is not scary at all, it works as a drama tragedy. But this film needed a remake, the story still relevant today and to tell younger audiences to watch the original (as good as it was) and ignore this version is not realistic.

5376562,2,B00A2H9WW8,"Carrie 2013 is just why Hollywood should STOP the remakes. The movie fails to capture what made the original so powerful. Chlo Grace Moretz, a very talented actress never gives off an air of being venerable and awkward the way Sissy Spacek portrayal captivated generationa
This remake is filled with Hollywood pretty. Sue Snell looks like she left the run way, stopped by the studio to pick up her check. The Chris Hargensen, played by Portia Doubleday, should have been the only Hollywood pretty in the movie, but, not to take away from the actress, she was a bargain basement let down and should have been cast as an extra, at best, as should Alex Russell who portrayed Billy Nolan.
Chris and Billy never had that really hot date together where the Chris character uses her charms on him to do her bidding; they just shared scripted screen time.
Ansel Elgort had a huge fail as Tommy Ross. He was supposes to be dreamy this was a miserable fail. There is NOTHING charismatic about this Tommy Ross. Maybe with is my I didn't bother with Divergent or The Fault in Our Stars. Okay that is too much to lie at Ansel Elgort feet. Just don't want to be part of another Twli-tard fan craze movement

The gym teacher Miss Desjardin, played by Judy Greer, had NO real connection with the Carrie character and offered no comfort to the supposed mis-fit Carrie.
And lets face it Julianne Moore is way too hot to be Margaret White. Julianne Moore performance was not religiously disturbed enough and was more a nuisance. Slapping a ratty wig on the Margaret White character doesnt make the character deranged, just in need of a comb.
True to Hollywood form, an African American couple was introduced and the prom and lend nothing to the movie.
Watching Carrie dance with Tommy was just painful, not romantic.
Do yourself a favor. Fast forward to the last 15 minutes of the movie: the prom scene, the comeuppance of Chris, and a story wrap of the Sue Snell story line.",1414368000,3,1956,4.620689655172414

Having seen the original Carrie, I honestly can say I did appreciate the attempt at this remake. I did not care for this film, but it does have its pluses. Julianne Moore played an incredible role, and really brought the emotional aspect of being a troubled woman to the big screen. She is the main reason why I gave this 3 stars instead of 2.

I am an avid horror fan and contemplated on even watching this film; mainly because I know of so many remakes that are such a disappointment. I am sorry to say, but this remake falls into that category. ""Carrie"" was played by a wonderful actress, but the ending completely ruined this movie for me. I personally believe that the ending was almost too overplayed and almost even a bit hokey. I just couldn't grasp onto what the director was trying to portray with Carrie's movements in the end. It was almost as if she was taken over by a robot.

All in all, this was a decent movie, minus the ending. I believe that had the ending been more satisfying, I would have definitely given this a higher rating. I was left unsatisfied and begging to watch the original just to get this bad ending at of my head.",1414108800,2,1277,4.4297872340425535

5376601,3,B00A2H9WW8,"It is perhaps unfair to hold a remake to the same standards of a near perfect original, but this film is superfluous at best, though I did find it moderately entertaining. Chlo Grace Moretz isn't terrible as Carrie, but her performance at times just did not ring true, not I was expecting anything close to a performance like Sissy Spacek's in Brian De Palma's 1976 film. Julianne Moore does give a very good performance as Carrie's mother.

I should point out that this film is based more on the De Palma film than on Stephen King's novel. (The famous ""plug it up"" line in the shower scene was not in King's novel but was in the remake.) Also, I was disappointed in the very end of the film (minor spoiler ahead), which had a supernatural element that was jarring and missing in Stephen King's novel. (The novel was written as a non-fiction chronicle of the events surrounding Carrie White's life. Telekinesis was viewed as a natural phenomenon.)

This could have been an opportunity to make the film a bit more faithful to the book (perhaps by including some of Carrie's childhood, using a documentary style or by portraying Carrie more as King described) or could have provided a thorough updating of the story (such as expanding on the ""cyberbullying"" portrayed in the film), but instead director Kimberly Pierce choose an easier path, creating film that is a mediocre adaptation of King's novel and inferior to De Palma's original.",1413849600,,1436,4.786290322580645

5376638,4,B00A2H9WW8,"Lately, it seems as if Hollywood will do anything to produce a surefire hit. Instead of taking risks with original material, studios rely on established franchises and characters to draw in audiences. They have even gone as far as to completely remake or ""re-imagine"" previous films. And so, 37 years after Stephen King's debut novel, Carrie, was originally adapted for the big screen, we get another film version of his classic high school revenge story.

The film follows the shy high school student Carrie White (Chloe Grace Mortez), as she endures relentless bullying from her peers. From the start of the movie, we are aware that Carrie does not fit in. She is shy, quiet, and a bit awkward. At home, a religious and disturbed mother, played by Julianne Moore, attempts to shield her daughter from the sinful outside world. This sheltered lifestyle ends up being the root of Carrie's problems. While showering after gym class, Carrie experiences her first period. Terrified by the blood, she panics, having a meltdown that draws the attention of the entire locker room of girls. But instead of helping the frightened girl, the others mock her, throwing tampons at her, and posting a recording of the entire horrific incident.

One girl, Sue Snell, feels bad for the mistreatment of Carrie, and has her boyfriend ask Carrie to the prom as a way to make amends. Meanwhile, Carrie discovers that she has telekinetic powers that enable her to manipulate objects with her mind. Both empowered by this new found skill and terrified of its possibilities, Carrie wants nothing more than to be normal and to fit in. So, she accepts the prom invitation. The rest of the story is an infamous scene of the horrors of bullying and the revenge that follows.

This is the ultimate revenge story. The talented cast of this film help to make the audience sympathize with Carrie. As she exacts her revenge, we are drawn to cheer her on, even when the revenge becomes out of control. Despite its age, this story rings with social relevance, commenting on bullying, the power of social media and other technologies, and the basic human desire to be accepted by our peers. Fans of Stephen King, horror movies, and thrillers are sure to enjoy this well done remake.",1413504000,,2248,4.848958333333333

Not five stars but I rarely use five. Definitely at the top of the 4 star heap.

5376673,2,B00A2H9WW8,"Sometimes a remake comes down the pike and it seems like the filmmakers are actually scared or nervous to do something fresh and new and different with it; that is the major problem with this ""Carrie"". It clings fast to the 1976 Brian DePalma film, and veers too far from the Stephen King novel. Playing it safe made this movie a failure for me.

Another issue is that this version of the character Carrie White is extremely easy on the eyes, not the greasy faced frumpy nerd she ought to be; it's supposed to be sort of a dark Cinderella tale, but this girl hardly needed the transformation into a swan. And Julianne Moore as Margaret was decent but almost bland. Granted, in 1976 Piper Laurie went over the top, considering the script satire, but at least she was memorable (and nominated for a supporting Oscar, along with Sissy Spacek as Carrie).

Watching this movie, I began to feel a little like I did when watching the pointless remake of ""Psycho"": shots seemed to purposely mimic the original film. Even the set of Margaret White's kitchen seemed nearly identical to the first movie. What's the point of doing a copycat? Anyway, maybe this remake will draw curious young people to the original flick, and they can see what a really tense prom sequence can be like (with solid cinematography, editing, pacing, and music).",1413072000,2,1329,4.6995708154506435

5376676,1,B00A2H9WW8,"There is a lot of 'inside baseball' here. This remake of a seventies movie apparently had many versions and rewrites. I don't know. I just watched this new movie on a whim. I wondered what the new movie makers had changed. Quite a bit it seems.

The movie is a bit unsettling because it's hard to understand just where and when the story takes place. It's one of those Hollywood high schools where all the students are nearing thirty. All the boys drive what look like seventies cars but the girls have smart phones. There is also a slur against home schooling that fixes the time as closer to the present even though all the people act like they are living in the fifties. The most alienating feature of the story is that this is supposed to be a public high school where there are no blacks or Hispanics. In fact I went to such a high school but those schools no longer exist. White teens from nice families now go to private schools and the public schools are multi-racial hell holes where there are armed police, metal detectors, drugs and gangs.

So the movie is about a place and a time that have no connection with the real world. In this place apparently everyone accepts and believes in 'Hollywood Atheism'.  Like real world atheists the Hollywood Atheist doesn't believe in God - but does believe in the Devil.  No one seems to find that odd.

In the original 1976 movie Sissy Spacek looked the part. She had the great advantage in this part of not  being very pretty but the new girl is actually a looker. She, like Julianne Moore playing her lunatic mother, simply don't wear makeup. That alone, it seems, is supposed to mark them as crazy.

But the biggest difference - and it is a difference that totally changes the story - is that this new Carrie isn't a victim. She is a superhero who must have wandered in from some X-Men movie. She has more powers than Superman and she knows it. She recognizes that she has these supernatural powers and she works on developing them. She isn't the victim of teenage 'mean girls' she's  a nascent demi-god whom you will want to avoid offending.

In the Superman movie the young Clark Kent can run real fast but he can't yet fly. Carrie, however with only a week or so of working on her powers, not only can fly but she also has heat vision and super strength. Give her a another week of superhero practice and no doubt she could kill her classmates even more quickly and more gruesomely. The moral seems to be don't play practical jokes on classmates who have God-like abilities.",1412985600,4,2531,4.484782608695652

But in the end, it did not measure up to the original. It's quite possible that certain films just can't and shouldn't be remade, no matter how good of a cast Hollywood can muster up. Carrie is one of those aforementioned movies. As good as Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore are as actresses, they could not captivate the scenes as well as Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie did in the roles of Carrie White and her mentally unstable mother, Margaret. At the end of the day, I give it 2.5 stars for sticking to most of the original storyline, but very little else.",1412899200,,714,4.5
5376686,3,B00A2H9WW8,"School policy has changed. The attitude of students has changed as well. We certainly don't live in an era in which the sort of bullying of students and incompetence of faculty as are evidenced in the original movie. That being said, it was an unusual choice to have so few be ultimately responsible for the tragedy at the end. Almost the entire cast was either helpful to Carrie or was at least sympathetic. Originally I considered this kind of twist on the original story to be problematic because I thought that it would end up with the audience hating Carrie for being what they always considered her to be, some kind of evil presence. Instead, I found I could still relate to Carrie even with the malice and hopelessness of the original movie mostly removed. I didn't like that so few chaperones were at the High school prom, or that so few laughed at Carrie when the blood fell. Kids are foolish and I know that there would be a certain percentage of the audience that would hoot and holler to no end regardless of how awful a fate befalls someone on stage. The original story was an indictment of a system that had let a young girl largely fall through the cracks, at the mercy of her mad mother. This version seems to be more a loose tragedy of errors. Carrie uses a great deal of logical arguments to counteract her mother's crazy rants, showing she was less victimized than the original. The biggest plus of this new film was the odd, orgasmic way Carrie used her telekinetic powers. I'm glad they drew out those scenes a bit. I miss watching the principal be horribly electrocuted and then burned to death onstage like in the original. Carrie comes off as a bit more a cold-blooded, ruthless murdering enchantress. While that has a certain allure, the motivations for her to go from religious shut-in to Malificent was not fully worked out. It's not a bad movie, but it lacks alot of the savagery and gutshots of the original. The soundtrack is not nearly as good as the original (barring that horrible workout music from the original, so seventies!). Overall I don't regret having seen it, I like her freakout scene Ok, but I think a bit more needed to be added to highlight the new, more tragic route they were obviously going for.",1412899200,,2244,4.570719602977667

DePalma's version of Carrie was much more effective in all areas. Spacek's Carrie was much more plain Jane and unfortunate looking and acting than the Moretz portrayal of Carrie. Spacek's shower scene and finale were both more intense and riveting than this updated version of Carrie. While Moore's performance of Carrie's mother was interesting, Piper Laurie's portrayal of Carries mother was truly disturbing and unsettling. Also, Nancy Allen gave a superior performance as the teenage female villain in DePalma's version. A good deal of this has to do with a semi flaccid script on this remake.

I will never forget reading Stephen King's Carrie., nor will I ever forget watching the movie Carrie (1976). I am not a fan of remakes, or reboots. I find them pointless when the original is indisputably a classic. I will admit when I received the email from Netflix that the 2013 rendition of Carrie was on line, I was a little excited, maybe it was because it is October, and there a few horror movies worth the watch.

I think everyone knows the synopsis of the film (novel). Carrie White may have been unfashionable and unpopular, but she had a gift. Carrie could make things move by concentrating on them. A candle would fall. A door would lock. This was her power and her sin. Then, an act of kindness, as spontaneous as the vicious taunts of her classmates, offered Carrie a chance to be a normal and go to her senior prom. But another act--of ferocious cruelty--turned her gift into a weapon of horror and destruction that her classmates would never forget.

It is a simple plot, but so packed full with depth and underlying themes that are so uncomplicated they are genius.

I was prepared to dislike the remake. The original had Sissy Spacek as Carrie, and Piper Laurie as Margaret White, Carrie's mother. The two carried the movie. Their acting is what made the movie such a success. Laurie was amazing. Creepy. I had nightmares from her performance as a religious heretic, a Bible thumping fanatic. Spacek was so timid and shy, so pathetic and weak. I could never imagine anyone else playing either role nearly as well. I remember trying to watch other movies with Spacek, and just couldn't do it. She scared me. Even though she was never the evil in the story.

In the remake, Julianne Moore is top billed, portraying the role of Margaret White, while Chloe Grace Moretz landed the part of Carrie. Unfortunately, but showing great diversity, Moore nailed the role of Margaret White. Normally an attractive woman, Moore has forever scared me. She managed to capture and add to the role, paying complete homage to Piper Laurie's performance. Moretz had big shoes to fill. At times she came very close. Mostly she missed. Just missed. Moretz is far too pretty, far too cute to garnish much sympathy or empathy. This is not meant to imply Spacek was not an attractive woman, however, when she was Carrie, she was Carrie! Now, with that said, Moretz did elicit emotions in me while watching the movie. I felt for her character when she talked with the gym teacher about being asked to prom, and when Tommy Ross actually asked her to prom. Moretz did portray sense of sweet innocence that made me like her. All I meant was, she is no Sissy Spacek when it comes to this . . . legendary and iconic role. (Think Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka . . . close, but no cigar). Some pluses include seeing more into Margaret White. Just a bit more of her as a sick person. It added to the story. It added to the horror.

The high morals gym teacher, Mrs. Desjardin (Miss Collins in the original), played by Judy Greer, was well done. She kept the performance true to the original, played by Betty Buckley. The roles of Sue and Tommy Ross, Chris, Billy Nolan, and Norma were non-eventful in both movies and, sadly, hardly worth the mention.

The remake is more relevant. I feel like the reboot serves a purpose. The incorporation of cell phones, the internet and YouTube were essential to draw in teen viewers. It made the movie appeal to a wide audience. It exposed a new generation of Stephen King and horror fans to a classic in a way that would make sense, and was relate-able. For that, I understand and applaud the new rendition. The special effects were extreme, a bit thick and poured on, but did assist in the  prom scene.

The climax, when Carrie returns home after prom to tell her mother she was right, that they all laughed at her, was as graphic and impacting and sad, and troubling as it was the first time I saw it in the original. The women did an amazing job at recapturing that . . . magic. The overall sense of loss and dread, and emptiness were complete.

If I were seeing the movie for the first time, I'd have easily given it 5 Stars. However, there is no way I can evaluate this version of Carrie without comparing it to THE Carrie. And for that, I am forced to give the movie 3.5 Stars. And this may be a spoiler, but I was kind of upset that Carrie's hand did not shoot up out of the grave in the final scene. I waited for it. Never happened. (Might be why I am giving it a 3.5 instead of a 4).

5376720,2,B00A2H9WW8,"This is the second reboot of King's horror classic that strives to feel more like an 80's teen angst movie meets the twilight zone than a truly creepy horror flick unlike its 1976 predecessor. King's films rarely transpose well on the silver screen, & most lose most of their savor & story in the form of a cinema length shock fest. The reason; King's specialty is the characters more than the tale. His novels take along time to develop those characters & that kind of patience in storytelling does not transfer well when big CGI budgets are traded for quality of plot & performance. It is a sacrifice that deteriorates nearly all of his concepts into little more than cheap thrilled, gore propelled, drive-in fare. Unfortunately, this film also does not escape that malady. Although, Chloe Grace Moretz's performance rivals Spacek's in both emotion & authenticity. Her scenes are almost difficult to watch as she plays the tormented teen which such genuineness it is uncomfortable, nearly painful to view. However, her stellar portrayal can't compete with the lackluster, stereotypical, & two-dimensional performances of her supporting cast. The story is told too abruptly & tries too hard to be a mimic of the original movie rather than the novel. Although you connect with Mortez, the rest of the film feels disjointed & over reaching. Moore also delivers a haunting but somewhat over the top portrayal of Carrie's zealot mom. Again, feeling too much like a copy of the first film. Director Pierce is pretty well know for her indie films, I wish she would have poured a little more of that style into this production. The special effects are sleek and realistic, but I think the build was focused on that element rather than the emotional dysfunction of Carrie & her Mommy Dearest which is the driving force of the book. One day they'll get the King Equation right, but for now, we will have to settle with the best Hollyweird can deliver.",1410307200,3,1943,4.855421686746988

5376743,5,B00A2H9WW8,"I finally bit the bullet and bought it for streaming here. First things first: a lot of people, specifically critics, have complained that the film is not as scary as the original. Well, I never considered the original to be a horror movie. Most of what Stephen King writes, to me, has always been speculative fiction. gory, violent sex addled at times, but SciFi.

And on that this story stands firm. There's an honest tension that you can feel in the characters who deal with this ""weird girl"" and the strange things that keep happening around her.

Carrie is the victim here, and this is best represented in Sue's closing remarks (which I will not spoil for those who have not seen it). The only true villain is, and has always been, the mother. This sadomasochist who warps religion in an attempt to bring pain to the only thing she was capable of loving: her daughter.

The story is timeless and this retelling shines with its own light. If you're looking to get scared, go grab a b-movie bloodfest. There's plenty to choose. If you're looking for a character driven, emotional story with some solid CGI and plot driving special effects, watch this. You won't be disappointed.",1407628800,,1181,4.695652173913044
5376744,1,B00A2H9WW8,"Why, despite a spirited ad campaign and subject matter that translates to any generation, did it turn out today's audiences were so apathetic about the release of ""Carrie"", Kimberly Pierce's remake of Brian DePalma and Stephen King's horror classic? After all, De Palma's version last graced theaters 37 years ago. I have to believe it's simply because the 1976 film adaptation of King's first published novel long ago entered that rarified pantheon inhabited by the truly great horror movies (Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", Carpenter's ""Halloween"", ""The Exorcist"") as well as the very good ones that managed to embed themselves in the public consciouness (""The Shining"", the original ""Nightmare on Elm street"", etc).
  In other words, each new generation of film buffs is aware that it's just not possible to not only improve on De Palma's bleak, terrifying work, but to even hope to approach it's high quality. Like the original ""Halloween"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", among many others, the 1976 version is scary BECAUSE of it's relatively low budget and grainy feel, not despite of it. As we've seen countless times over the last decade or so, adding a big budget, flashy special effects, and gorgeous, vapid movie stars don't boost a horror flick's fright factor.
  The acting here is decent. Chloe Grace Moretz shows flashes of inspiration as poor doomed Carrie White, but the fact is, she's still too attractive, or at least normal looking, to pull off what the script insists. Let's get this straight: Sissy Spacek IS Carrie. Has anyone ever, in film history, been more perfectly cast? And while Julianne Moore is superb as always, she doesn't come close to the terrifying villainy of the original's Piper Laurie. And Moore is ALSO too attractive, even while slumming without makeup. The only casting preferable to the original is that of sexy Judy Green, in the role of the concerned teacher.
  The bulk of the blame, however, must go to the person who crafted the movie: Director Kimberly Pierce. She's far from inept; occasionally she shows us a clever technique or two. But she clearly has no idea how to make a movie scary. And that's kind of important when directing a horror flick. You're unlikely to find a LESS scary horror movie than the 2013 ""Carrie"".",1407542400,6,2264,4.992042440318302

Even this Carrie's DVD cover is unimpressive in comparison to a crazed red-headed prom queen surrounded by fire.

You have a kid who doesn't know her power (her beauty and her worth), and ""the strong"" kids pick on her because they can. Chlo Grace Moretz did a good job portraying Carrie - especially in her posture. This kid walked like she was apologizing for even being alive. She was definitely prey to the ""stronger"" kids. Carrie was likable in spite of her being despised. Like the gym teacher, you want to instantly be on her side (as the underdog) and show her compassion. Nothing deep or profound here. In America, bullying does exist. This is the quintessential bullying movie. I do believe there are some people who possess the power of telekinesis. I doubt that it is that strong and that fast, but the ability does exist. I always want to know who wrote the book.

5376759,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Hard to improve on the original, but Chloe Moretz adds something special to this remake. She has it all. The most charismatic young actress you are likely to see in your life time.

Like most remakes, this movie is underrated. The usual negative reviews, insisting the original is better because it's more ""original"" virtually guarantees the lower ratings for remakes.

As much as I like Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in the original, it's hard to compete with Chloe Moretz.

I vaguely remember they were going to have Carrie destroy the whole town/city in the original, but for some reason did not (maybe budget restraints). One opportunity they missed with this remake.

*One last thing regarding the MPAA rating system: An R rating for Carrie is laughable. Oh my God, one of the girls says the ""F"" word and Carrie has her ""period"".

If you send your kids to high school, they will hear kids use the ""F"" word and girls will have their ""period"". By MPAA standards, our high schools are rated R and kids ""under 17 years may only be admitted if accompanied by a parent"".

Then they over did it when they had Carrie float away and crack the road by stomping her foot. Suddenly Carrie is superhuman and has the power to bring down hail stones? Ridiculous.

5376768,1,B00A2H9WW8,"You know, even as much as I am opposed to most remakes, I was actually excited about and looking forward to a new adaptation of this particular Stephen King novel. This story was not only my introduction to my favorite author, Stephen King, but also my favorite director Brian De Palma. And, the love affair I've had with both artists' work over the years has been very rewarding to say the least.

As I said, I am typically against film remakes, and for several reasons, but I won't go into that here. But, in this case, I don't really consider this necessarily a ""remake"" as much as a new adaptation of the source novel. And, I honestly enjoyed the previous updated version of this that was done for television a few years back. Sure, there were some hokey moments, and some over-the-top CGI effects, but overall it was closer to King's novel, and it was enjoyable in its own right.

But, when I first started seeing trailers for this one, I started getting a little concerned, and my interest starting to wane a bit, because it not only looked like a direct retread of the Brian De Palma classic, it looked like it was loaded with very bad CGI to the point of looking unrealistic.

Well, I relented and gave it a try anyway, and sorry to say, but I felt like this was pure torture to sit through, and not for the reasons the filmmaker probably wanted. First off, the acting is atrocious. Very cut-rate, generic, dumbed-down so the audience won't feel left out, obvious script-reading at its worst. In other words, the kind of acting you might see on some lame television series that only lasts a couple weeks before cancellation. Yeah, it's that bad!

And as for the story, well, it is nothing but a direct lift from Lawrence D. Cohen's script for the 1976 De Palma classic. Oh, sure, there are some modern technology updates, but nothing really effective to the overall story. This is pretty much the same kind of ""remake"" as Gus Van Zant's misguided remake of ""Psycho"" a few years back - nothing more than a frame for frame reimagining at its worst.

And, don't even get me started on the whole prom sequence fiasco! What was the high point and crescendo of the original film (and even the television remake) falls very flat here, and makes the viewer cringe for all the wrong reasons. Dialogue is added where it's not needed (you know, the whole dumbing-down so the audience will ""get it"", ugh), and the acting is nothing more than some retread of something from the ""Twight"" movies.

Matter of fact, this entire project seems to be directed at that whole ""Twilight"" tween crowd, and not at any serious lover of film art.

I seriously recommend you stay as far away from this turkey as possible. If you want to see a filmed version of this story, stick with the classic De Palma film (it was nominated for two Academy awards for best actress and best supporting actress, something unheard of for a horror movie back then), or even try the 2002 television remake; but avoid this one like the plague.

Thank you!

I've always been a fan of Mr. King and Carrie was the first book of his I read. Although it's not as close the the book as people would hope, this version of Carrie focuses on Carrie and not a horror aspect of it. We get so much character development in this film we didn't get in the original.

Sue and Tommy are the two character that in the Original, I didn't feel connected to. But in the 2013, I feel like both characters had enough time to be a little more fleshed out. You understood why Sue wanted to help Carrie and why Tommy was willing to help. It felt real when Tommy and Carrie were at prom and he called her beautiful.

I know a lot of people bashed this film, but they shouldn't just look at it as a remake, but as a movie about a girl who struggles with bullies and is pushed too far. It's a beautiful story and I think this version is the best out of the three.",1404259200,2,899,4.011173184357542

I broke down though. I loved Kick Ass, so when I saw that Chlo Grace Moretz would be Carrie I was a little more  intrigued.
The add in of of the video really helped modernize it and added another side to Carrie's bullying. I loved the prom scene, the extra torture scenes could actually make you feel what Carrie's revenge was really like. I'm gonna stop before I spoil anything. Chlo definitely did a great job, and so did everyone else that worked hard in the movie.

I felt nothing from this movie, and that's sad, because when I watch the original I always feel all the emotion of the characters, particularly Sissy Spacek's Carrie.

I suppose I feel that with all the new technology to come along in the past 30 years, these films will only get better once they are enhanced and edited, but the truth is that they are always missing something important, and rarely do justice to the original. The remake of Carrie isn't all that different from the original, just modernized, as Carrie is a loser, who with puberty discovers an amazing power. She tries to hide it, but when pushed, ultimately uses it for evil, it's a classic Stephen King story, that most people already know and there in lies part of the problem. Assuming that most people know the story, a lot of information about Carrie is omitted, leaving the film little to go on. They quickly jump into the story and for a long time have nowhere to go with it. Kick-Asses Chloe Moretz stars as Carrie, and while her performance was outstanding, it is wasted in this film. They really played up the religious angel and Carrie's mother, played poorly by Julianna Moore. Yes, it was creepy and that's what they wanted, but it was so over the top and in your face, that it quickly becomes tiresome. The producers of this film had all the tools to recreate this Horror classic, but fail miserably, as their take on the story was abbreviated and way over the top.",1402185600,,1370,4.528225806451613

5376841,5,B00A2H9WW8,"As you know Carrie tells the story of a lonely girl who is being bullied by her religious fanatic mother and ""The Ultras"" at school and her only outlet of empowerment is her power of telekinesis. It's through this power she gains strength and courage to stand up for herself which I feel like she does at least to her mother towards the end. Now for me when I first saw the movie I felt lied to because for months the movie was labeled as ""A faithful adaption to Stephen King's Novel"" when really it's a complete homage and remake of the 1976 film. Many important scenes such as Carrie's power summoning hail as a child, The town destruction, Margret's ""Thou shall not suffer a witch to live"" scene, Chris's first interaction with Carrie ""Wipe that Smile off your Face"" at the pool scene is simply not there. Despite this many scenes are original with a different interpretations with Chloe giving a performance I truly prefer over Sissy Spacek's because as someone that is still an outsider I can relate to how Carrie feels, how Carrie stands furthest away from the crowd, being very soft spoken, even the very first scene with the pool volleyball I could relate to with Carrie's fear of being around her peers standing at the corner. I truly believe that her shyness and her demeanor is truly realistic as it comes in a film which makes it something I see in myself. To me Carrie 2013 is more about the consequences of bullying, shyness, and wanting to be accepted that can be seen in people today especially teens rather then a alleged scare fest that was 1976 Carrie. I think that's why some people hate it cause they want to be scared when really a true interpretation of cyber bullying, and school bullying plays a major factor in a victim losing her cool.",1400284800,2,1762,4.544025157232705
5376842,3,B00A2H9WW8,"With that said, I was surprised by this remake of the classic DePalma film, based off Stephan King's novel. The performances are up to standard, with the exception of [insert name here] who plays Sue. As pretty as she is, she gives a wooden performance. Not awful but lacking in comparison to her other co-stars.

When reviewing a remake, one is compelled to compare it to the original. Unfortunately for ""Carrie"" (2013), it is trying to re-do a classic chiller that is re-known for its iconic performances by 2 of its female leads, Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Chloe Grace Moretz is a great Carrie. Although she looks nothing like the character as written by King (Spacek also didn't BTW) and despite being too cute, too pretty, she is very believable as the awkward teen who is constantly bullied by her cruel classmates. Once overcome by vengeance during the prom scene, she is impressive. In contrast to Spacek who simply stared, Moretz gets very physical when unleashing her fury, using her hands and body and it is effective visually. I do have to add that during the prom scene, Moretz resembled a blood-soaked Britney Spears... just sayin'. Julianne Moore, as expected, is good as Carrie's mother but she does lack Piper Laurie's sinister appeal and many to date remember Laurie for her chilling, over-the-top performance in the DePalma film. I do not think Moore's performance, as good as she was, will have that kind of everlasting impact.

The remake is very faithful to the original film. The content has been updated (how can anyone make a film about teenagers and not include a smart-phone?) and the special effects are clearly better. However where the film-makers lost it was in the execution. Despite glossier production values, they managed to eliminate the fright factor. This Carrie is polished but not scary. There is far more destruction on screen yet it remains underwhelming. One of the biggest let-downs for me was the prom scene. The original used various techniques to enthral the audience - the awesome split screen, minimal music, drastic lighting and those haunting Spacek eyes. That classic image with the fire rising from behind a blood soaked Carrie as she stiffly walks off the stage remains a potent image in horror. The remake offers nothing of that magnitude. There is destruction and a lot of it but the prom scene, which is supposed to be a highlight, pales in comparison and remains a missed opportunity. But one of the film's biggest disappointment was the final closing scene. It is lame. The original film closed off with a dream sequence with Amy Irving, dressed in white, walking to Carrie's burial ground. It was a haunting addition to the film and closed it off brilliantly. What they did in the remake was just plain lazy. I did not expect the film-makers to imitate the original but come on, at least attempt to close the film off with a bang.

Overall, this is a pretty good remake but it could have and should have been great. The DVD does not come with any extras but the picture quality and sound are good. This is where I have to vent a little. I purchased the Blu-ray of the original classic thinking that it would be a better purchase - extras, video quality etc. It turns out the only extra included was the theatrical trailer BUT the DVD release of the same title (exact same cover) had the extra bonus features **SCRATCHESHEAD**

The exact opposite is true here. If you would like the bonus features, pay the little extra for the Blu-ray.",1399939200,,3499,4.768976897689769

Ms. Moretz is miscast and only ...  at the very end ...  becomes somewhat 'touching' [she does bears in interesting resemblance to the late Joan Fontaine ....before her passing].  Everything else is really a jumble of badly delivered lines and adults trying to play High School teen misfits ..... Ms. Moore is extremely brave to work almost without make-up [dark  lashes are retained] ... her ""look"" reminds one vaguely of Kirk Douglas in a fright wig wearing an ill fitting Mrs. Bates frock.  It IS disappointing and rather sad to see an artist of Ms. Moores calibre playing  Mrs. [Ms.?] White with a range that runs from ""manic # 1 to manic #1 and back again""!  The ""self-mutilation"" scenes are utterly tasteless and belong in the rather more sensibly deranged world of Ken Russell's ""The Devils"".  [With a mother that deranged the child should have been removed by social workers years ago].  The music [for what its worth] nods vaguely at the original score.

There's absolutely no pacing or development in this movie - ""scenes"" just meander on and on and on - especially the painfully drawn out ""stare me down"" sequences after the prom inferno.

Ms. Moretz's seems to be having an eternal ""Bad Hair Day"" ... Homage to the Jennifer Jones' coiffure in ""Duel In The Sun""?

5376862,5,B00A2H9WW8,"When this new version of the classic 1974 book by Stephen King came out, I was not that interested on watching it, to be honest. I remembered liking Brian De Palma's 1976 version a lot and watching it several times in my youth. Thus, I did not think that the remake would be much better, but, oh boy was I wrong!!!

Kimberley Peirce's re-imagining (this is NOT a remake of the 1976 film, but a re-imagining of Stephen King's 1974 book) is SOOOO much better on every single aspect that when comparing it to De Palma's film it makes the latter look like (with all respect and literally) a mediocre film. Where to begin?....Let's start with the acting:

1) Chloe Grace Moretz. She delivered the best performance I have EVER seen in my life. She was incredibly good at making you empathize with her character in a way that the 1976 version could only dream of. Chloe IS Carrie White while you watch this film: you get so much into the story and her character and what she goes through that you completely forget it's fiction (even though most of the elements of the story are, unfortunately, painfully realistic). I have already seen Kimberley Peirce's masterpiece (there is no other way to describe it, to be honest) 5 times and I'm planning on watching it again tonight, and every time Chloe breaks my heart and makes me cry.....

I was bullied when I was a kid and I know exactly how it makes you feel, and Chloe shows it perfectly: the pain on her face, on her expression, on her eyes, on her voice every time someone bullies and hurts her is just so realistic that unless you have no heart you feel so incredibly sorry for her character that when things appear to get better you go from heartbreak to elation, only to (as we all know) end up again heartbroken at the end....

When you watch this film you just want to hold Carrie and tell her that everything is going to be alright, that she is beautiful inside and outside and wonderful and that those who bully her are nothing compared to her, that they are people who themselves have serious issues with self confidence and that she will find someone who will love her....But you REALLY want to do this during the film, thanks to the incredible performance by Chloe Grace Moretz, who herself has been bullied in real life so also knows exactly what it feels like and delivers a performance full of honesty based on her own experiences and feelings, as she herself has said in interviews.....

In my honest opinion, Chloe Grace Moretz deserved an Oscar for best actress for her performance, which was unfairly given to someone else, but then, how many times have Oscars not been given to the people that actually deserved them? Think Sigourney Weaver for Aliens in 1986 (which by the way is my favorite ever film, but only four positions ahead of Carrie (2013), on my all time ranking).

Compared to Chloe's, and with all due respect, Sissy Spacek's performance was nothing short of cartoonish. And this is the honest true. Maybe it was partly because of the screenplay, which turned the amazing Stephen King characters into cardboard characters, or maybe (or also) because, unlike Chloe, Sissy Spacek was in her late 20s when she appeared in the 1976 version, while Chloe (and lets remember here that the character of Carrie is a teenager, not someone approaching her 30s) was 15 when she appeared in the 2013 re-imagining, and thus, makes her character much more realistic by just looking at her, and this is even before comparing their acting. But it's probably because of the simple fact that Chloe Grace Moretz is a much better actress than Sissy Spacek.

After watching Carrie (2013) and being so extremely impressed with Chloe's performance I decided to watch several of her other films, including Let Me In (2010), Hick (2011), Texas Killing Fields (2011), Dark Shadows (2012), Kick Ass (2010) and Kick Ass 2 (2013) and just like I expected from watching her on Carrie, all her performances were incredibly good and believable, specially on Let Me In, where she delivered another amazing and haunting performance.

I have never seen someone so young (she is only 17 now, and 15 while filming Carrie) acting in such an amazing and incredible way, and being as mature and intelligent as she is (just check her interview on one of the special features of the Blu Ray of Carrie (2013), called 'Creating Carrie' and you will see what I mean). I have also seen other interviews with her and she always appears amazingly down to earth and not at all conceited, even though she is not only a famous actress and extremely talented but also very beautiful, which is all the more credit to her. I hope the best for her career as it is very rare for someone so talented and beautiful to also be so mature and intelligent at her age and (again for what I've seen of her in interviews) to also be such a genuinely nice person.

2) Julianne Moore. Her performance, just like Chloe's was superb. She was extremely believable as the religious zealot who turned her daughter into a virtual home recluse and who, in her failed attempt to protect her, actually hurt her more than protected her. For the first scene on the film (which starts with Julianne's character) you BELIEVE that she is a religious extremist and that she has major psychological problems, and also that she should have never had a daughter, as she doesn't know how to raise her.

One of the aspects of the film that makes it so heartbreaking is that, unlike the 1976 film, here Margaret White's character is not a one dimensional, unbelievable cardboard-cut religious extremist 'baddie' caricature and thus you actually believe that she genuinely loves her daughter, but, again, without knowing how to raise her properly, due to both of the issues above mentioned. The scenes Chloe and Julianne share perfectly emanate the deep love between each other, and it makes it all the more heartbreaking at the end of the film. Also, those scenes when they have a confrontation still show that they both love each other deeply, which is something extremely hard to accomplish, in my honest opinion, especially when the temptation is there to try to scare the audience (which is what the 1976 version did all along), rather than to show a realistic and dramatic scene as portrayed in King's book.

Correspondingly, I also believe that Julianne should have won an Oscar for her performance as best secondary actress, which was one of the best I have ever seen (and this includes all her performances in past films where she was Oscar nominated, including Boogie Nights were she also had a similarly motherly character).

3) The rest of the cast was also amazingly good, starting with Judy Greer who played the character (rightly named after the novel, unlike in the 1976 version) of Ms. Desjardin, who did a great job of bringing humanity to someone with a position of power at the high school where the horrifying bullying of Carrie happens, and who genuinely showed her caring for the latter.

Compare this with the 1976 version, where this same character (called Miss Collins) at one point basically condones the bullying that Carrie suffers, when she says that she could understand what the girls felt like about Carrie having her first period and not knowing anything about it (before throwing the tampons at her), as she felt similarly, and thus as if this was Carrie's own fault somehow, not her mother's and her peers', with the latter wanting nothing to do with Carrie other than to bully her and make her feel like nothing. Of course this could just be because of the screenplay of the 1976 version, but then this same character does not show anywhere near the compassion in De Palma's version that Judy's character does on the 2013 film anywhere on it. What is clear is that while Judy Greer is phenomenal, very believable (like every character on the 2013 version) and likeable, Betty Buckley is none of the above on the 1976 one.

Gabriella Wilde as Sue Snell was very convincing and made you believe that her character actually wanted to make up to Carrie on this version of the story, while the corresponding actress (Amy Irving) on the 1976 did not managed to do so. Similarly it goes for Ansel Elgort, who played the role of Tommy Ross: he is extremely believable and likable as a genuinely cool AND nice guy (and thus not all conceited as in the 1976 film), while William Katt on De Palma's version was nothing more than a cartoon character, and extremely unlikable.

And for those who say that Chloe Grace Moretz is too beautiful to play Carrie, they show a complete lack of knowledge and understanding regarding bullying: it doesn't just happen to people who are not considered `beautiful'; it can happen to anyone who is seen as an easy target, such as those who don't fight back. I wasn't ugly when I was bullied at school, and neither was (for example) Sarah Michelle Gellar, another actress who (like Chloe) was bullied during her school years. In fact, beauty can bring about bullying when others are jealous of your beauty and they perceive that they can bully you using any excuse and thus try to make themselves feel better by putting you down.

And this brings us to the screenplay:

The 1976 version was a loosely based adaptation of the Stephen King book, and took many liberties on the story, such as changing the ending to a cheap shock-based scene which (like other reviews have pointed out here on Amazon) cheapened the story, to the point which (at least temporarily) may make you forget that the book (as the 2013 version) is MAINLY a drama about bullying and what being overprotected can bring about (as shown with the several references to Carrie having previously been tricked by her peers in the past, which are present on the new version but completely absent from the 1976 one). Also Sue Snell's pregnancy is only present here, as well as the gas station scene, to name but a few. While the screenplay of the 1976 version is solely trying to scare and shock the audience and completely ignoring what Stephen King was telling us on his book, the screenplay of the re-imagining does a fabulous job of showing exactly what King always intended the story to be about.

As in 'Boys Don't Cry' (1999), Kimberley Peirce shows her mastery at directing characters who are going through extremely difficult situations, as well as at directing those who made their lives hell. On both the latter film and on Carrie (2013) the evil characters are not caricatures, but extremely believable characters and thus the effect they have on the films is to make them far more believable than otherwise. Also, all the credit to the casting of the re-imagining as Portia Doubleday and Alex Russell were the perfect choices for their roles, and show that they are extremely talented actors.

Another aspect that deserves attention is the haunting score by Marco Beltrami, which, unlike the Psycho rip-off score of the 1976 version (a film which even references Hitchcock's film by changing the original name of the high school found on the Stephen King book from Thomas Ewen Consolidated High to 'Bates High'), takes hold of you from the first time it plays and helps you get into Carrie White's shoes, which, again, is what King intended (as on all his novels, of which I have read virtually all as I am a massive fan of his writing). Marco Beltrami's score helps you feel what poor Carrie White is feeling at all times, from total sadness and heartbreak, to happiness, to regret for her final actions and finally to heartbreak again.

A very important fact is that the 2013 version, masterfully directed by Kimberley Peirce and written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, makes SURE to leave the right message at the end, with an ending which is similar to that in the book, and which ensures that when the credits come, you are not feeling scared about poor Carrie, but heartbroken by her plight. Again, this is the complete reverse of the 1976 version, which, for what I can now see (but I did not realize until I saw the 2013 film), did not care at all about poor Carrie and just seemingly wanted to make people scared of an innocent, sensitive and hurt soul, which, to be honest, I find despicable.

Carrie may have ended up killing many people, but the re-imagining clearly shows that she did NOT intended to do so (including several times right after Carrie kills someone, where it can be clearly seen on her face) and Chloe's fabulous performance is central to showing just how much she regretted it. Like the theatrical and DVD ending explains, she was pushed too far and you can only push someone so far until they break. This film has had such an effect on me (emotional and psychological) that it has fully opened my eyes to the horrifying effects of bullying on people, and has made me realize that is something that needs to be treated with extreme seriousness and eradicated from every single school not just in America, but everywhere.

Even though I am a fan of Brian De Palma, after watching Kimberly Peirce's take on the story, I had to admit that (with all respect to everyone) De Palma and the rest of the team involved on the 1976 version did a mediocre job, but this is only noticeable if you watch the 2013 version in an HONEST way and let the drama of the actual story (as described on the book) take over you (as Stephen King originally intended), rather than going into it thinking that this film is your standard slasher teen horror film (as the 1976 film was), as it is not. Also, if you watch this film looking for flaws because you hate remakes (this is a re-imagining of the book, not a remake of the 1976 film) or because you love the first adaptation, you won't like it, and it will be all the worse for you as you will be spoiling the best film to come out of Hollywood in more than a decade.

Important: There is an online petition asking for the original cut of the film to be released on DVD and BluRay this coming Halloween. Apparently the original cut was very different and included aspects from the book not present on the 2013 version (and definitely neither on the 1976 one) such as the destruction of the town, the White Commission, Carrie killing survivors of the prom, the stone rain and Carrie and Tommy kissing, to name but a few. This original cut was also longer than the one released on cinemas and DVD/BluRay. They need 20000 signatures and at the moment they are just short of 6000. Unfortunately I am not allowed to post the link here but if you search for 'Carrie 2013 petition' online you will easily find it. Thank you in advance.",1398902400,,14603,4.658129608071401

After all, it's been 11 years since the last remake of Carrie, just as it was only a decade since the massively successful Spider-Man series of movies was launched. That franchise really needed rebooting, right? Back to Carrie: I don't know what it is about this movie that has people wanting to remake it multiple times. Is it the ending? A different ending each time? Whatever the case, one fact remains: Hollywood has gone remake mad, in the name of massive profits over creativity and originality. This movie borders on unnecessary, and is a rental at best. At least it moved along well (is that because I knew what was going to happen next)? This movie DOES provide some things that are different, such as iPhones and CGI. I'm being sarcastic, of course. At face value, this is a decent movie for anyone who hadn't seen the first two. For the seasoned Carrie veterans, this movie is inferior and pointless. Stick to the 1976 movie starring Sissy Spacek.",1398470400,9,977,4.686046511627907

I was so glad to see Carrie, a teenage girl who had to deal with her abusive, so-called Christian mother at home and ongoing bullies at school, fighting back those who were against her. To my pleasure, she gave her lousy mother a taste of her own medicine.

I do recommend this movie. It is worth watching. You won't be wasting your money.",1398384000,,473,4.197802197802198
5376891,4,B00A2H9WW8,"For fans of Stephen King, this story is a must have. The 1976 Brian De Palma original with Sissy Spacek is a classic. This movie could be a letdown for those expecting a note-for-note remake or tribute but does wonderfully on its own. There are a lot of areas that this film falls short of the original in empathy inducing backstory on the two main characters but it more than makes up for that in powerful recreations in other areas of the King story.

Chlo Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore are superb, as always, in their brilliant character creations. Did they do better than Spacek and Piper Laurie? No...but they weren't playing those exact characters.

Moore created a character that is more realistic and familiar but still no less fascinating than Laurie did in 1976. Moore's ""Margaret"" is portrayed with more depth to better understand her mind (although the extra features showed cut scenes that would have taken this even deeper, what was in theaters was still more comprehensive than the original).

Moretz, in her own way, also recreated Carrie into a very easy to pity young girl with a rough background. However, she continues to develop the character as the character's abilities grow until the pinnacle scene at the dance when she transforms all but physically into something inhuman. The transformation and performance shows well the talents of Moretz.

Did the director, Kimberly Peirce, make a true-to-the-original-movie remake? No but I believe that this was not her intention.

Did she do just homage to the original story? Absolutely even with the changes that all movies go through when making the transition to film.

Finally, did she really need to make a new version of this story? Without a doubt, Peirce more than did the story justice while also bringing this classic King horror story to a new audience with enough modernization for them to relate it to their own reality. The addition of modern items, music, and technology to the always present bullying in these types of King stories makes this retelling more understandable to today's youth (the school age people that the story involves) as they can see on the screen what they see in their lives.

I don't see this ever overshadowing or even comparing equally with De Palma's version, but they are two separate movies made for two different generations almost 40 years apart. They are both wonderfully made films backed by the glue of a great story written by a true master of horror. I recommend them both.",1398297600,,2493,4.879432624113475

This version follows King's book very closely and the special effects are SOOO much better than in the original (as they should be).  While I'll always love Sissy Spacek's stare when she's up on that stage (simply classic), Miss Moretz does Carrie's charachter justice.  The supporting cast is very, very good as well.

5376894,3,B00A2H9WW8,"This remake of the classic 1976 film and book didn't live up to my expectations - and I whether expected it.

Julianne Moore has always been one of my favorite actresses since the 1990s but some for reason she didn't command this role like one Piper Laurie once did (who freaked me out as Margaret).  I found Moore to be whether boring and flat.  Same can be said for the young lady Chloe Grace Moretz (who I liked in 'Let Me In') who played Carrie.  I didn't sympathize as strongly as Sissy and when I read the book.  The only person who stood out slightly was the guy who played Tommy.  He was at least trying and giving some effort.

Now as for the graphics, had not been for the graphics, this personally been a one star movie.  The graphics were pretty good and kept me glued in towards the last 20 minutes.  As for the ending, did anyone get the Freddy Kruger vibe as I did.  For those that haven't seen it, the ending is tad different and more disturbing than the original graveyard ending to the 1976 version.

Other than that, it was a little of this and little of that from the book, classic film and new additions (make way for the use of internet playing a big role in the new adaption).

Having said that, I took the plunge, purchased and recently watched it, but not sure what to expect. The story has been modernized, even though the main story line of high school rejection, iron fisted parenting, etc, is timeless. Chloe and Julianne did an excellent job as Carrie and Margaret, I was most impressed with my fear of the creators making a mockery of bullying and the suicidal results, being false. They didn't do that all, nor did they condone the retaliation concept, although despite Carrie's destructive rampage after finally being pushed too far by everyone) was good. The modernized idea was not overdone nor were the CGI special effects any less convincing than the other 3 versions, at least with me. The material was handled very carefully and bullying was depicted as it should be : cruel and despicable, which was very. Good. Check them out, you maybe surprised, cause it sure did me.

5376955,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Carrie is a remake of the 1976 classic horror movie where a shy young girl, Carrie White, posses telekinetic powers. Carrie has always been the subject of ridicule by classmates. Carries mom is deeply religious and has harsh restrictions on her. However, everything started to turn the other way for Carrie when popular lacrosse star Tommy Ross ask her to the biggest dance of the year, prom. Some people weren't too fond of her going and set out to ruin it for her. Did they go too far?

This is a classic Stephen King novel about a girl who posses strong telekinetic powers. If she can think it, she can control it. There are some small differences between the movie and book but only a couple major differences. In the book they described Carrie noticing her powers when she was a small child over an argument she had with a kid in the neighborhood. In the movie, she notices her powers around her senior year of high school in the gym locker room. The other major differences you would have to rent the movie and see for yourself.

My biggest problem about the movie is how they didn't go into more detail about Carries powers. They showed her noticing that she is gifted in a way but keeps playing out the story. By the end of the movie she is able to do things that would seem to maybe take years of practice but she learned in the matter of days. The things she could do at the end of the movie made it cool, but just seemed fast paced.

This is not a movie that will make you jump out your seats. It is not a movie that is really that suspenseful. Right now this movie is currently out on Redbox and is worth renting for $1.20 but I wouldnt recommend buying it.

5376978,4,B00A2H9WW8,"Remakes can never quite do justice to ""originals"" for the simple reason that they are not ""original."" Though it's been a number of years since I read Stephen King's novel and saw the 1976 film version, from what I can tell, CARRIE (2013) follows the original storyline quite closely, enhancing it with smartphone photos of the infamous tampon-throwing scene and a brief episode of cyber-bullying. It's generally well-filmed, and the acting ranges from tepid to pretty good, with Julianne Moore giving an impressive performance as Carrie's mom. Without any fundamental changes to the roles they play, Carrie's fanatical mother and certain schoolmates come off as just a little more human than they did in '76. This version also gives a convincing portrayal of a contemporary high school, which is never an easy thing to do. Certain other aspects such as the English class poetry reading are skipped through quickly and cursorily, and anyone who's unfamiliar with the basic story may be left wondering how these scenes are supposed to fit into the whole. In short, it's in some ways better, in other ways worse, than CARRIE (1976).

It would have been a risk, and fans of the book and ""original"" film would not have liked it, but, even if meant departing from what's in the novel, I think this version would have been better-still with more modernized details and small but significantly different twists. Though quite good, CARRIE (2013) comes off a bit too much as an update for the sake of an update.

At any rate, horror fans who have never read the novel or seen CARRIE (1976) will probably find CARRIE (2013) satisfyingly unpredictable if not a little confusing.",1395532800,,1666,4.925266903914591

But, the problem here is that this film is practically a shot-for-shot remake and offers nothing new for anyone who has seen the original. It ended up being a rather boring film considering nothing here aside from the role of Carrie's mother is done better than it was in the original.

If you've never seen the original, you will probably enjoy this as it is for the most part well made. If you have, you will find yourself bored through most of it.",1395187200,,778,4.557142857142857

From reading Stephen King's book (which is also recommended) it is clear that originally Carrie was not meant to be a horror story, but rather a tragedy - both Carrie's, her mother's  and her classmates'.

Never mind you can see ""carries"" panties in the shower scene when she's on the floor (so she's not naked or bleeding since she's got bright white undies on!) but why skimp on the end? The performances are top notch ( but missed the ""these are godless times"" / ""I'll drink to that!"" scene too much!) but the reliance on re-shooting DePalma's original hurts, especially the aggravating montage of picking prom tuxedo's. The supporting characters are flat and the finale is off mark. Why, oh, why does the trailer promise King's destruction of the entire town but the movie doesn't actually have it? Why does she let people live who die in the book? Why? Why tone it down and happy-up the ending? Why? Such a missed opportunity, I wanted to love this film.",1394668800,2,820,4.585034013605442

So with that being said I tried to go into this movie with an open mind. Overall it was a great movie, slow at the begining and then brute force at the end. Just like the original. Chloe did a great job playing as Carry. At first I thought she had too much of a soft face to pull it off, but she did it! The Mother was great and the rest of the cast... they got the job done. Visual effects were great.

  Reason I didn't rate it more was because at one point I thought I was watching Chronicle... You know the movie where kids uncover some levitation powers and go crazy with them... I get they are trying to hit the younger crowds with it. But it got ridiculous watching her perform some super hero s***. HULK SMASH!!

The book by Stephen King was read a long time ago, and movie version with Sissy Spacek? was not too shabby. This one follows the story line, but in the end is just Stephen King making even more money.

Chloe Grace Moretz is going to be a major presence in movies for quite while. She is just great in the role of Carrie. Sissy Spacek was great in the original, so the differences are delivery. Moretz nails it.

Julianne Moore is one of the most under-appreciated actresses in Hollywood. She really improves the role of the moms over Piper Laurie's original. Where Laurie was over the top batty-nuts, Moore is calm and understated, which is really creepy - we expect lunatics to behave outrageously.

I was extreamly disappointed to find out that they were making a re-make (Or I should say a re-re-make, if one counts the made-for-cable version they did when they were hoping to make it a TV show like the Dead Zone).  Even Stephen King woundered why they were doing a re-make.
  I won't tell you in this review that it was great or that it was better than the Original 1976 version with Sissy Spaceck, because it wasn't.  But I won't say that it was FREAKING awesome either.
  It was decent.  If I didn't have the original to compare it to, I would actually say that it was a pretty good.
  The bad: 1) Let's face it, it's a Re-Make.  2) Julianne Moore just wasn't as good as Piper Laurie as Carrie's hysteronically deranged, Bible thumping, religous zealot mother.  Piper Laurie as the mother in the Original 1976 scares the crap out of me.  Julianne Moore did even give me a shiver.  3) It was way to updated.  4) It lacked the intensity of the Original Carrie.
  The Good: 1) Chloe Grace Moretz was a very believable Carrie.  She really got into the Character.  2) The bads kids weren't such goofballs.  I actually wanted Carrie to take them out.  The original 1976 version had John travolta & nancy Alan's Character's more goofball and bumbling.  & 4) The special effects made the telekinetic parts better.  And I like that.

The characters were mostly well-played excluding the lead role. This was a bit overplayed. Seems Chloe Moretz got caught up in a feeling and lost sight of her character's need to be understated in a more realistic manner. The creepy-christy mother was the best played role in the entire movie. That being said, she couldn't 'Carrie' the entire movie.",1392854400,,480,4.865853658536586

5377146,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Remakes are tricky. The remake of Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho didn't really do anything wrong, but was panned universally by audiences and critics, who said that it was exactly the same movie. The same problem followed Kimberly Pierces Carrie, which is an adaptation of the NOVEL (important to note) written by Stephen King.

The thing about this new Carrie is that it actually adds some layers from the book that were missing from the original film. Its not better than the original, but that doesnt make it a bad movie either. I don't think two better actresses in the year 2013 could have played the lead characters of Carrie White and her mother Margaret quite as well as Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore.

In case you're unfamiliar with the story, it follows Carrie White (Moretz), a young girl who is mercilessly bullied by her classmates because shes different. Carrie has special telekinetic powers, allowing her to move objects and people if she focuses hard enough. Her mother Margaret is the epitome of bad mothers. Shes delusional and an overly religious schizophrenic. When the one nice girl in school makes her boyfriend take Carrie to the prom, all hell begins to break loose.

Pierces Carrie is more focused on the small details, character moments that end up making a difference. It cant help but feel like the remake that it is, however. The story is essentially the same. Chloe Grace Moretz will grow up to be a very respected actress, if her performance here is any indication. She holds the whole movie, and does it very well. Not an easy thing for a sixteen-year-old girl to do.

Feeling perfectly comfortable in her role, Moore will scare the living daylights out of you as Margaret, Carries mother. Shes pure venom, without any redeeming qualities, but thats exactly what this character should be. While nobody can do it as well as Sissy Spacek, Carrie will allow for a new audience to eat up this delicious and sometimes tragic story. It follows the remake formula a little too closely, but if you go in more or less expecting that, youll have a great time.

5377176,2,B00A2H9WW8,"I watched this remake of the 70's De Palma horror classic Carrie with an open mind. I've never read the story so I'm not sure if this is more faithful to it or not? Hoping for the best, keeping my expectations low and wanting to really like this film. I watch yet another failed attempt to remake another classic with horrifying results.

Moretz and Moore are more than capable of giving excellent performances and they do a fair job, although I thought neither were nearly as effective as the original versions of these characters played by Spacek and Laurie. The remake fails more in the direction department. There is no build up to the climatic ending in this remake. Even though the film is pretty much scene for scene the same film, the direction and over blown sequences show just how Hollywood has gotten away from being able to tell a good story without catering to the ADD crowd who need an explosion every 2 to 3 minutes to keep their attention.

Everything in this remake is overblown, forget the simmering pot pacing of the original as it slowly builds to a heart pounding climax, the power of telekinesis in this version is so absurd and to the point of ridiculousness, her powers rival that of the strongest of X Men mutants, able to split streets and swallow up cars etc. I suppose if I had never seen the original I would have been entertained by the two leads here, but having known and loved the original it just pales by comparison on every level. It's a totally unnecessary remake that will be forgotten before I finish this review....",1392508800,4,1556,4.573476702508961

Ms. Moore did a great job creeping me out as carries mother. I loved how they focused more on Mrs White's self mutilation and abuse as well as Carrie's Telekinetic powers. The only part I was kind of disappointed in was the flying scene at the prom(that was a bit too much and ruined the chills for me). Over all I say they did a great job and added a few extra's into the plot that i liked.",1392508800,,564,4.0

5377182,3,B00A2H9WW8,"I saw that there was a new Carrie movie to come out in fall 2013 so as a Stephen king fan I felt compelled to see it. So of course I did. While I was watching it some of the acting was amazing, while at other times it was laughable. Now I've read Carrie and thoroughly enjoyed it, but it had a lot more detail, character development, and thought which of course is hard to express in a movie so I wasn't expecting the greatest movie ever. Now this movie has a lot of actors In it who did pretty good jobs specifically Chloe Grace Moretz, and Julianne Moore. Julianne is not the star of the movie but whenever she appeared she did a wonderful job, and I was skeptical to hear that she was playing Margaret White but she stole the show. Chloe did amazing as well, I love her in the Kick-Ass series. As for delivery it took two days and was fine. Overall an ok movie with room for improvement.",1392422400,,890,4.1502890173410405

5377184,5,B00A2H9WW8,I thought it was a good remake. But of course the original with sissy spaces is always better. Just as scary as the first one. This movie is scary no matter how many times you watch it.,1392422400,,185,4.027027027027027
5377195,4,B00A2H9WW8,"Margaret White (Julianne Moore) has a passionately unique interpretation of life. She imparts her wisdom and moral code to her daughter Carrie (Chlo Grace Moretz).

This and the fact that Carrie is exceptionally shy places Carrie in a unique position to be the target of bullying. Naturally she does not take the situation too well.  As with most of Stephen King's characters puberty hits her hard and she gains the unique skill of telekinesis.

It is unlikely that you have missed both the book and the earlier adaptive movie. However in case this is true, you will just have to see how the story unfolds from here.

Each rendition of the story has its audience. In this film they push the bullying theme to the nth degree even over the spookiness. However the story is not too compromised from the original.

It is a tossup as to wither the gory scenes ere realistic, exaggerated or just gratuities. I thought Julianne Moore and most of the actors hit their mark. Grace Moretz was good also but just a tad too cute for the part.

This is one of those films that you are too busy anticipating the first time through to appreciate the details and needs a second viewing.

Whatever their individual flaws may be, the freshness of the original films is always more fun to watch than these slick, botoxed retreads. There is literally nothing in this new Carrie that improves upon the classic 1976 Brian De Palma film: the score is generic (as forgettable as Pino Donaggio's score for the original is memorable); Kimberly's Peirce's direction is pedestrian; Chloe Moretz hasn't the skills (yet) to pull off the demanding lead role and is miscast in the first place, and none of the actors playing the high schoolers evidence any of the personality or star quality of Nancy Allen, William Katt, or Amy Irving. Julianne Moore is okay as Carrie's mother but nowhere in the same ball park as Piper Laurie's wonderfully loony, over-the-top performance in 1976 (which garnered her an Oscar nomination, mind you). No one brought any signature of individuality or inventiveness or vision to play here, which is crucial in making a remake work, making it pop. As I predicted above, it will be reduced to a mere cinematic footnote before too long.",1392249600,2,1422,5.029661016949152

5377215,4,B00A2H9WW8,"Carrie was an excellent remake. Chloe Grace Moretz was the perfect choice alongside Julianne Moore. My only complaint was that this version still left out two very important scenes from the book: 1) The scene where young Carrie sees her neighbor's daughter sunbathing, which leads to an important conversation, and 2) the meteor shower is completely left out.

I didn't like how they left the ending from the 1976 version. I think it would have been more tragic if they would have used the ending from the book.

The 2002 remake still remains the most accurate version to the book and this version is second. Definitely pick it up or rent it. It's still very accurate to the book despite the points I mentioned above.",1392249600,,717,4.728
5377216,2,B00A2H9WW8,"She is victim at school and at home. The only bright spot in her life is when she begins to discover her power. This one dimensionality makes her seem stereotypical and uninteresting. She was written and directed that way and so Ms. Moretz played her that way. Nothing really new about her for the audience in this remake. The young women bullying her were also one dimensional. No clue why the meanest one was so mean to her. And the dialogue was odd: characters who'd known Carrie from grade school referred to her as Carrie White, as if there were multiple, stick-out-like-a-sore-thumb Carrie's running around. Weird. Most schools have multiple students with the same name, but if the other student Carrie's aren't important to the story, why have the main character referred to so oddly. Suspect the filmmakers wanted the way the other characters spoke about her as meant to tell audience that she was so weird the locals used her entire name in their small town, but the use only came off as unauthentic and fake as kids in real life wouldn't speak this way. Special effects were good, acting was fine, as I said abit one note but okay. I liked that the filmmakers updated the story and put in cell phones and cyber bullying but I wish they'd updated Carrie's characterization as well, to show something more, preferably something interesting, about her. A hobby, a special interest (other than her emerging power), anything that would've filled her out abit. 2 and a 1/2 stars.",1392163200,,1483,4.77431906614786

In this version of the story, I didn't feel sorry for Carry, and when she killed, she seamed to not only put a lot of thought into it, but she also seamed to enjoy it very much. The only exception being that she only killed her mother because she had no other choice and she deeply regretted it.

5377259,2,B00A2H9WW8,"What a waste.  The lead was homely and unconvincing, as were the supporting actors.  Barely worth coming up with enough words to meet Amazon's rating requirements.

Let this one go.",1391817600,,181,4.966666666666667
5377260,4,B00A2H9WW8,Carrie was really versed on from the original film.  I love Julianne Moore. It is worth adding to my collection.,1391817600,,112,4.6

5377262,5,B00A2H9WW8,"its a very good remake compared to the 1976 original both Chloe moretz and julianne moore give great performances as Carrie and her overly religious mom Margaret, the bullying scenes are shocking but believeable, and her telekinetic powers are well done.
I personally think that this time the remake is better than the original.",1391817600,,328,5.092592592592593

5377274,5,B00A2H9WW8,you know these pass few years we've been getting tons of remakes of classic horror movies and none of them comes close to Carrie I actually prefer the remake over the 1978 version but Chloe Moretz did an outstanding job as Carrie you felt every emotion that she was going through and you just wanted to be there for her when the character's were bullying her and I honestly can relate to that feel cause I to was bullied in school as well I'm sure everyone in this world have been to and I really want to congratulate  Kimberly Peirce for capturing that in the movie to make peoples eye's to be a little more open for those who are getting bullied. So the story is base off of Stephen Kings novel which I'm now interested in reading now to me Carrie wasn't like a monster like Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers were who both had mindless slashing. she was normal like us and wanted to fit in but there were limits for her and her emotions got the better of her causing destruction with her telekinesis powers which was badass hahaha I wish I had those powers but one of my favorite sayings is Great Power Comes Great Responsibility cant believe I said that but it's true right ?! overall fantastic movie I also had to get the NECA Carrie figure cause I'm fan boy now you can also read up my review on that figure if your interested.,1391731200,,1330,4.32

This is a great movie I own both the original and this one but haven't watched the old one yet but I do recommend this movie Chloe Grace Moretz has a great acting performance in this movie.,1391731200,,345,3.942857142857143

5377278,3,B00A2H9WW8,"The original movie was better.

The antagonist characters did not have enough character development. Also, Sue and Chris were portrayed as ""best friends"" in the begining of the movie, which in real life would be highly unlikely, given the differences in their moral outlooks.

Carrie's facial expressions and mannerisms while unleashing her telekinetic powers can only be described as overdramatic and silly. There was not enough focus on her abilities or the aftermath of the disaster.

I also found this movie to be too gory.

Last, this movie copied the first movie too much. I would have liked a movie which was more true to the source material.

I was disappointed.",1391731200,,670,5.0

5377282,5,B00A2H9WW8,"I have to give the remake 5 stars because unlike the original it works.  When I saw the original Carrie it just seemed weird you didn't know if u were watching a horror movie, drama, or just a very sad story of abuse.  The remake however hits the mark, it does a very good job of building and telling the story of Carrie with added special effects showing her power of telekinesis which it desparatly needed.  There have been comments that the actors dropped the ball on this film, honestly I couldn't tell the difference between the new Carrie and the old Carrie played by a young sissy spacick.  As for the rest of the actors there really isn't much acting involved, the plotline is pretty straightforward as it always has been.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how well the movie survived being transplanted to 2013.  Chloe Moretz was magnificent as the young, naive girl who is discovering that she has ""super"" powers.  Julianne Moore shined as her religion obsessed mother.

5377358,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Carrie (2013). Rated ""R"". Running Time: One hour, 39 mins.
Directed by Kimberly Pierce.
Second remake of the original movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie-HD/dp/B0046B6X1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie [HD</a>] (1976).

There is a woman screaming in a house. We follow the stairs up. There is fluid and blood. In the bedroom, Margaret White (Julianne Moore) is laying on the bed yelling to God. There is blood all over her sheets around her. She continues to scream and then she looks between her legs. She sees a baby. She gets a pair of scissors to stab at the baby girl, but then she changes her mind and picks up her baby to hold it close to her.
  It is now 17 years later, the girl, Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) is now at high school at the swimming poll. She is very modest and covers her body with a towel. She is uncomfortable around others, especially those young teenagers kissing. In water volleyball, Carrie is shy with the other girls and not athletic. The P.E. Coach, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer), tries to get Carrie included in the game. The girls are outgoing and assertive. Carrie is more reserved.
  Later, in the shower as Carrie begins to use the soap to wash herself, she sees blood. Not knowing why there is blood, she becomes upset and yells for help. She goes to the others girls in the locker room still yelling for help. They are not kind to her. Chris (Portia Doubleday) takes a video with her iPhone of Carrie in her bloody embarrassment. Ms. Desjardin comes in and tries to help Carrie.
  Carrie didn't know what a period was. It was her first ""woman's time""
Carrie also discovers she has extraordinary powers. She can make things happen to items and other people.
  At home, she asks her very religious mother, Margaret, why she didn't tell her about periods. Her mother criticizes her and says it is a curse to bleed and have sinful thoughts. Her mother makes her stay in the closet until night time.
  At school, the teenagers are still mean to her.

Also in the cast: Gabriella Wilde, Billy Shabaka Henley, Alex Russell, Ansel Elgort, William MacDonald.

Chloe Grace Moretz was 15 at the time of filming. Sissy Spacek was 27 when she played ""Carrie"" in 1976.
Moretz was the first choice to play ""Carrie"" in this remake after seeing her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows/dp/B00943SQCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows</a>&nbsp;(2012).

Julianne Moore really wanted a role and she got it.

I like how they had the principal Billy Shabaka Henley) be moral and decent, careful of choosing what words he said in front of ""Carrie"" after her embarrassing ordeal.

Filmed in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.

5377359,1,B00A2H9WW8,"This remake was terrible in more ways than one the actors were stale, cheesy and lacked personality in this one. In this 2013 remake the main actor ""chole grace moretz"" in NO way tried to measure up to the main actor of the original [sissy spacek] much less the actor [julianne moore] who played the mother of carrie in this remake. This film is pretty awful much of the scenes are the same thing as the 70's version with a lot of bad CGI thrown in there, even the prom scene is the same except lacks the atmosphere created in the original. There were also scenes which weren't really needed. It was best left to a minimum until the end to create that powerful shock of suspense and horror, that's why it was so shocking in the original.
Julianne moore was quite terrible as a crazy woman playing margaret white, but the original mother [piper laurie] had that crazy wild over religious personality and that nut job look on her face that made for a superb performance. Moore i'm sure is a good actress but she couldn't really pull off the ""crazy over religious woman"" vibe NOT as piper did so on that note i'll say everyone was terribly miss-cast. As for ""chole moretz"" she didn't have the same dedication to her role as sissy did, meaning you don't get that social outcast vibe. This movie overall fell flat it lacked ingenuity, horror, shock factor, believability, charisma, and the ability to keep one intertwined with the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie for any horror fan odds are it's very boring, this is more for the new un-original millennial generation that likes un-original trash of remakes upon remakes.",1390867200,8,1623,4.638888888888889
5377360,4,B00A2H9WW8,"I liked this one better than the original. It followed the book more than the original but it should have been set in the 70's and not today's time, IMHO. Good movie, though!",1390867200,,174,4.303030303030303
5377361,1,B00A2H9WW8,Yeah really disappointed with this version and take on the Carrie White story. I don't know what to say the directing was and story was just OMG! not good. Julianne Moore Brilliant. I couldn't see or feel anything past her performance.,1390867200,,235,4.7560975609756095

5377363,4,B00A2H9WW8,"The acting was pretty good... better than average; especially Carrie's mother. Some reviews say the girl was too pretty for this part, but I disagree. Right here in my town, there's a very beautiful young lady, who is very good at art, yet she's not popular and a lot of the kids at school pick on her some. Besides, the main character played her part pretty well for the most part. I think it's worth viewing and even buying, in that she did one thing in this movie that ""Carrie"" didn't do in the old movie; she seemed to actually do things intentionally, instead of just randomly by just suddenly glancing at something. In other words, there was a point and design to her madness (as to mean anger). Her sense of ""pay back"" was believable, and the movie showed that was she did was by her own will and design, which actually made it more believable. I gave it 4 stars for quality, but not 5 because it's a redo that is good, but doesn't necessarily negate the old version.",1390867200,,974,4.386740331491713

Well, if you have never seen ""Carrie"", then probably will be fine for you and really no reason to see old one. Is sad that not more money spent on this and effects.

5377396,2,B00A2H9WW8,"My wife purchased the Blu-ray of the 2013 remake of CARRIE yesterday and I sat down last night and watched it. Although Sony had stated that the movie would be a ""re-imagining"" of the story, such is not the case. In fact, the movie is based largely upon the script for the original 1976 version that was written by Lawrence D. Cohen and directed by Brian De Palma, which itself made some significant changes to Stephen King's novel. To be sure, there were a few changes made to bring the story into the 21st century; for example, in the locker room scene where Carrie is terrified while experiencing her very first menstrual period, one of the jeering girls whips out a smart phone and shoots a video of the event, which is later posted online. Later on, at the prom, after Carrie has had the bucketful of pig's blood dumped on her, the aforementioned video is displayed on large flat screen TVs set up in the gym. Aside from those small changes (and a few others that could count as spoilers), there are only modest differences from the original script for the 1976 version.

The main problem with the film is the acting. Chlo Grace Moretz tries hard, but really doesn't come across as the shy, sensitive girl who gains confidence with her new-found telekinetic powers. Julianne Moore reads many of her lines in a flat, lifeless manner, almost like she was reciting names from the telephone directory. Even the usually likable Judy Greer as the gym teacher comes off as a bit hollow. In fact the only performance that is okay is that of actress Portia Doubleday, who plays bad girl Chris; but even though she comes off as appropriately bitchy, she lacks the nuances of Nancy Allen's performance in the original. Another problem is that there is no chemistry between any of the actors, something that was in abundance in the original.

The one improvement over the original are the special effects, which are used in abundance. Unfortunately, special effects are a tool to be used in conjunction with other aspects of a movie, which have been neglected here.

Obviously, comparisons with the original 1976 movie are inescapable. The original version is a horror classic, with great performances (Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were both nominated for Oscars for their performances), great cinematography (the use of split screen during the carnage at the prom is terrific), a great score (by the underrated Pino Donaggio), etc. The 2013 remake is largely forgettable when compared to the original.

One note about the Blu-ray: it contains two different versions of the film, or perhaps more accurately, the same film with two different endings. You can watch the theatrical version or ""theatrical version with alternate ending""; the alternate ending was deemed ""too shocking for theaters"", but I doubt that is the case. In any event, the alternate ending is a homage to the ending of the original film, with a bit of a sick twist... you have been warned.

In conclusion, if you REALLY want to see the remake, then I suggest you rent the movie instead of buying it. Watch the regular theatrical version first, then go to the version with the alternate ending and skip ahead to the ending. But if you REALLY want to see a good classic horror film, then I suggest you stick with the original.",1390780800,4,3288,4.77152899824253

The original was amazing, and nothing compares to Sissy Spacek, but this remake brought Carrie into our time and made it so much more relate-able.
It was also a little different in parts. but all in a good way.
The bigger budget for this film, compared to the original, made a huge difference to the film and cinematography.

Collectively 2 or 3 would probably be more fair.  Chloe was precious. Her acting was phenomenal when she was alone, playing off her psychotic mother or the coach  the scenes with her date were Cinderella at the Ball. It liked to tore my heart out because she captured such joy while I knew about the bucket of blood that was waiting overhead. The ensemble cast had the right chemistry. Most performances were good to exceptional. So I honor them all with a 4. But it didn't work. Just like the difference between a good and bad comic can be matter of timing, all those great pieces were assembled badly. The great special effects were repeated or shown in slow motion and lost a good deal of the punch. It would have been scary and horrible if they had just let that stuff happen. Instead it was merely gross. I only blame the people off camera. They let great effects get in the way of the story and the people it was all happening to.

Versus the 1976 adaption where Sissy Spacek looked possessed, Chloe Grace Moretz pulls of the sinister enjoyment of her powers as she punishes her peers, like in the book. I do note that this film attempted to do justice to the book and the 1976 version so it has some issues. Overall I love this adaption and in my opinion it's better than the 1976 version because this one is more faithful to the novel in various ways, such as the school name, Sue's pregnancy (which I forgot about), and Carrie's enjoyment of inflicting harm on her tormentors.",1390521600,4,692,4.456692913385827

Don't get me wrong, Sissy Spacek is iconic in her role, but I felt like I could have gone to school with Chloe's Carrie, i feel like Siss Spacek's Carrie would have been institutionalized long before she made it to a public high school. What I didn't like, and it's not specific to this movie, but happens a lot in both remakes and originals is i don't like how either the director or screen writer allows contrivance to steer the plot and actions of the movie, instead of using the writing or direction to create real life scenarios so the character would logically behave the way they are needed to to move the story along. Point in case, when Sue arrives at the school gymnasium and notices what is about to happen to Carrie on stage, Judy Greer's character, ""Ms. Dejardins"" immediately just shoves her out the gym door and locks it. A real life teacher would not have behaved that way, I asked several teachers, and none of them, administrators and teacher/chaperone's alike would have responded to the students concern. Also, any athletic female student trying to prevent what happened to Carrie would have fought Ms. Dejardins and easily overpowered her and not been pushed around so easily. I get that it's just a movie, just wish writers, directors and even the actors would think more like the characters they are trying to create and portray and act like a real person in the same circumstance would act.",1390435200,7,1524,4.669144981412639

I think Chloe Moretz played the part perfectly.  I don't know if Stephen King wants us to feel sorry for Carrie, but in this version I certainly did.  She came across as innocent and yet wanting to fit in at school.  To me, she was also ambivalent about her mother - she loved her but also understood she was (just a little) nuts.

I think the scene where Julianne Moore is behind a counter delivering a dress was unnecessary - we already know she's crazy.

So many very good ones out there to make a move from. Like Cate Tierman's book Balefire. A super natural thriller about identical twins with awesome magical powers. or the Series Sweep.

Chloe Grace Moretz is a phenomenal young actress and plays the role of Carrie in a way that makes it impossible not to cheer for her, hope for her, and truly wish for the happy ending she rightly deserves but Stephen King rarely grants.

5377451,4,B00A2H9WW8,"I approached this film with a little trepidation like I would most remakes.  The original is always at the forefront and any attempt to improve on it would seem fruitless. Director Brian De Palma probably made the definitive Stephen King screen adaptation with his version of ""Carrie"" surpassed only by Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"".  The old adage applies here, however, that Shakespeare is constantly being remade and reinterpreted  so other classics shouldn't be immune.  What director Kimberly Peirce has achieved in modernizing King's work is making it accessible to a new audience, not unlike Baz Luhrmann's recent reworking of ""The Great Gatsby"", who may not want to be exposed to a nearly forty year old film.  Peirce also develops backstories for familiar characters and adds new flourishes that even though true to the source have you guessing as to the ultimate outcome.  There's less of a camp level on display here than in the original.  I also like that Julianne Moore does a different riff on Carrie's mother with no reference to Piper Laurie's take in the first.  The star continues to rise for Chloe-Grace Moretz with her extremely sophisticated portrayal of Carrie.  Moretz perfectly captures Carrie's timidity and insecurity in the early scenes and later her joy when discovering the empowerment of her previously untapped telekinetic skills.  In the prom scenes Moretz also shines like a swan changed from an ugly duckling, feeling the joy of her blossoming femininity and not the curse her mother berates her about.

It isn't really an updated version of the film. A few things are different, but nothing enough to make me think ""Wow this really gets today's kids."" No, there was bullying back in the 70s the same as there is today. This film is pretty much scene for scene the same thing as the 70's version with some bad CGI thrown in, Even the prom scene is the same. Then there were scenes we didn't really need, like in her bedroom making her bed float. We already knew what she could do. It was best left to a minimum until the end. That's why it was so shocking.

Moore is ok as a crazy woman, but the origional mother had that crazy wild bushy hair and nut job look on her face. Moore, a beautiful woman and great actress besides this film, can't really pull off ""crazy.""

As for ""Carrie"" she didn't have the same dedication to her role as Sissy did. Ms. Spasick made sure to never be-friend or speak to any of the other actors during the film. This gave an extremely believable ""outcast"" vibe from her. Something this actress didn't care enough to bother with. I didn't buy for a moment that she was an outcast in any way at all.

Another failed reboot of a film that didn't need to be remade. So far, out of all the reboots, only Planet of the Apes has been anything worth watching. Why can't we get original films made? Is Hollywood dead and lacking of actual talent?",1390176000,7,1463,4.251798561151079

5377471,3,B00A2H9WW8,"There is no denying Chloe Grace Moretz  is a great young actress. What's wrong with this film is not with her at all. It's almost everything except her where this film goes wrong. The supporting cast, save Judy Greer, is very average. Being 'average' can work for a Lifetime movie but not on the big screen. I was shocked at how low budget it seemed. And the choices made were very odd.
For example, the 'birth' scene at the beginning was unnecessary. The 'period' scene was way overdone in every way. And every single time kids are shown making fun of Carrie. It was overkill. Were ALL the kids that bad? It was ridiculous at some point.
Then we come to Julianne Moore, who plays Carrie's mother. She is a fine actress but I never felt she was very good. It was overacting. Perhaps that is what they were shooting for but we need to be able to identify with these characters and I have been around religious people my whole life and not once have I met someone like her. She was clearly insane.
But, as disappointed as I was with most of the film, eventually Chloe Grace Moretz rises above it and delivers some very memorable scenes. She is a powerful actress I hope does not fall into trouble like so many young actors do.
Here was a chance at a film that could have followed the novel more faithfully. Well, it didn't. Instead, it tried to follow the DePalma film and though I am not a fan of that film, it is certainly better than this one. The constraints of that period are gone. We can do almost any special effect. And what made the novel so incredibly moving was what happened to Carrie and the connection she made with Sue. Maybe that is unfilmable but it would have been a bold choice.

5377490,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Though for classic horror fans Carrie(1976) still holds up, this is a well done reboot of the Stephen King novel and Brian De Palma film. Having read the book (though more than 25 years ago now, in about the 9th grade) and having seen the original movie (a few times, most recently last year) I was interested to see what they would do differently. I didn't begin watching Carrie with particularly high or low expectations. This ambivalence leant objectivity to my viewing.

The performances, while quite good were not as impressive as they should have been with such juicy parts and talented actresses. I don't know why they didn't perform as well as I believe they could have (director? script issues? fx issues? or the actresses just couldn't connect with their characters?). Most likely there is more than one reason, but whatever the reasons both the experienced Julianne Moore and the relatively novice Chloe Grace Moretz gave somewhat uneven performances. If they were better than very good I would have rounded up to 4 stars rather than down from 3.5 for the 5 star scale with only whole stars available. As it is we rely on the solid story (Carrie is one of King's better novels) and modern special effects.

Where the story is concerned there were two significant differences from the earlier version and more importantly the novel that are worth mentioning. SPOILER ALERT! The movie begins with Carrie's birth. Perhaps someone who has read the book within the last 25 years can confirm or correct me, but I do not believe King wrote any such scene. I found it unnecessary and capricious. Alternately the other change was a modernization in the storyline that was necessary since without the inclusion of mobile phones and social networks any story about modern high school students would itself be capricious. So the addition of Carrie being filmed in the locker room scene and its subsequent upload to a Facebook-like website was a natural update to make. In fact I can only assume that their fictitious school has strict rules against phones in the locker rooms or there would have been more recordings and uploads than the one by the slithery Chris Hargensen. Btw Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen actually gives the most consistently good performance in Carrie.

As to Carrie's discovery and mastery of her powers I would say there is both benefit and damage in how they were depicted. She seemed to enjoy the powers without as much hesitation as was in the novel. It's inconsistent to have a girl excited to be so exceptional in one breath while pleading with her mother to be allowed to be normal and just like everyone else in the next. This is not to suggest that she should be completely ashamed of or horrified by her powers, but certainly she would be ambivalent at least. I did find it natural for her to experiment with them as she did, but I would not be at all surprised to read the term, ""over-the-top"" in a review or two when discussing her powers after things turn for the worse at the prom. She quite quickly went from attempting to control lifting books and her bed in the air to crashing a car into air. This is the fun of the film though, isn't it? Carrie going haywire is, after all what we all rent or buy the movie to watch. In this sense, the filmmakers did quite well. Carrie does go haywire, and when she does, she has suddenly and supremely mastered her telekinetic powers. Kimberly Pierce extends these scenes more than De Palma did. Certainly she was thinking of her audience. In our current horror genre renaissance directors are surely pressured to make the most of the climax in a movie where the terror is not throughout the film, but builds to it.

All in all I recommend the film to fans of the genre. I'll temper the recommendation by sharing that I am glad I decided to rent Carrie rather than buy it. It is an uneven attempt to bring King's opus to life, but done with gusto. Carrie is horrifically entertaining. Enjoy fellow movie lovers!",1390176000,4,3992,4.682336182336182

I thought the movie was well done and all the actors did a fine job, the effects were of course far better then in the 70s, and the Mother of Carrie was awesome! she truly did a great job with that role-(my fav person in the movie)  The problem i found was not  the writing,acting,effects---etc.  what i didn't enjoy was all the high school kids-
proof that i am getting up there-  i think for the younger crowd? this is a good movie-  and if it was somehow made with less kids i would have liked it alot more-  for example- Carrie is all grown up and has been hiding her ""gift""  until a group of jerks mess with her and she snaps--  that i would enjoy-  yep i turned into an old grump-",1390089600,,890,4.051724137931035

5377511,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Based on a short novel by Stephen King, the original 1976 movie may have been good for its time, but the slow pace and weird editing choices just make it simultaneously boring and awkward. With this remake, I read that the people involved were going to reinvent the original and put their own spin on it. Yeah, that didn't happen.

Full spoilers here, so sorry if you somehow don't know the story. High school outcast Carrie White lives with her crazy religious mother. Shes invited to prom by a nice popular girls nice popular boyfriend but the mean girl and mean boyfriend drop some pigs blood on Carrie. Then everyone dies.

The foundations for an exciting movie are here, but unfortunately this is pretty much the exact same movie we got in 1976. I watched that one a couple of months ago and scene-by-scene the story is mostly the same. They even included a weird out-of-place montage from that one and though I didn't put them side-by-side or anything, Im pretty sure that some of the dialogue is the exact same from the original. Granted, there are a couple of modern references (including an accidentally hilarious Tim Tebow one), and a goofy new ending has been tacked on, but this is mostly a barely updated version with a new cast. Personally, I think the climax scene at the prom might have actually been longer and slightly better in the original. Here it is surprisingly a little brief without as many creative kills (as horrible as that sounds).

I had no troubles with any of the acting, though I think casting Chloe Moretz as Carrie is a bit ridiculous. She is simply way too attractive to be this much of an outcast at school. Julianne Moore as Carries mother really steals the show and does a fantastic job of being a terrifying lunatic. All of the teen actors thankfully play their parts fine.

Overall, there isn't all that much to say about this new Carrie movie. I think it could be mildly enjoyable for those who have never seen the original, but keep in mind that the pace is pretty slow and there are few actual scares in this horror film, but more creepy moments involving the mother. If you had to choose between the 1976 and 2013 editions of this story, I would say go for the new one, but honestly I was hoping for a more original and more exciting remake than this.",1390003200,5,2296,4.538647342995169
5377512,5,B00A2H9WW8,"I had already seen the 70's version, but I was never really impressed by it, however It was the trailer for the remake that inspired me to read the book before I watched the film (call me crazy, but that's mho). The book is such an easy read, and is entertaining from start to finish. It is easily one of King's best novels. The unique attribute of this story is that you already know whats going to happen, and you already know how its going to end, but that doesn't matter. It's the entire anticipation of the story that keeps the audience on edge and plagued with anxiety. With that said, I absolutely loved this movie! It reflected the novel much better than the 70's version (especially the deleted scenes). Moretz did a fantastic job playing Carrie, and Moore did a frightfully good job playing Carrie's mother. My only beef about this film is that i really wish they would have focused more on the ending. The ending in the novel is so much more elaborate and so much more destructive, it's really the payoff of the whole story, but like the 70's version, It was downplayed. The upside is that it isn't as downplayed as the 70's version, so I guess I'll give credit where credit is due.

5377558,3,B00A2H9WW8,"I really wanted to love this movie.  I didn't want to compare it to the book,  the original movie,  (Sissy Spacek) or the made for tv movie,  (Angela Bettis)  But how can you not?  I tried to watch it as if I had no idea what was going to happen.  I had high hopes for this modern, updated version.  However, this movie lacked something the original (and the tv version) had.  Though the updating was done well, with the use of cell phones and computers,  cyber bullying.  It did help bring the story into our modern world.

  I didn't  really feel very sorry for Carrie in this version.  There wasn't enough emotion., anxiety,  or loneliness.  Carrie wasn't afraid enough.  Chloe,  wasn't able to pull off the transformation from  ( ugly duckling )  to  ( prom queen. )  Not because of her acting abilities, but because she just wasn't  pitiful enough to start with.  The other Carries had the ability to look down right homely,  living in total fear of her classmates.  Then suddenly be drop dead gorgeous.  I never felt that Chloe really understood the pain Carrie was in at the torment of her classmates.  Few do!

  I was expecting much more from the prom scene.  With the advances in special effects,  I expected to see the get even scenes to be a little more frightening and realistic.  The original still gives me chills.  I rooted for Carrie.  I was right there with her.  Sissys eyes could look right through you.  (without all the hand waving as in this movie)  There were too many kids  running from the school,  and dare I say at the risk of being very un-PC,  still living.  Maybe it has more to do with the times.  With all the school shootings and other real life horrors.  Its like they tried to tone it down.  I wanted to be scared a few times at least.  For me though,  this movie seemed more like an After School Special or Saturday Morning 70s show about bullying,  with pigs blood.  I kept thinking.. Its Saturday morning!

Overall I would recommend this movie!!,1389830400,2,387,4.105263157894737
5377561,4,B00A2H9WW8,"I watched ""Case 39"" quite a while ago, and minus the ending perhaps, I thought that it was a really, really underrated horror film.  In particular, Jodelle Ferland -- the little girl who is adopted in that film, and who had unfortunately only a bit part in ""Twilight"" -- just gave me the willies.  She was horrifying, surely more scary than even Linda Blair in the original Exorcist, as Ms. Ferland played a more psychologically scary role in that film is almost all that I will say.

But I will add that ""Case 39"" had some really interesting themes.  Without giving much away, at the very beginning of the film, you see her parents trying to bake her in an oven.  Of course the audience believes that the parents are more than simply abusive, but as the film wears on, you slowly but surely realize that maybe they really weren't all that bad after all.

And the way that this remake starts reminds me of that film, and I actually thought that the writer and director were going to change this up a bit and explore some of those same themes that were in ""Case 39.""  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to quite go that way.  I complained before with ""The Amazing Spider Man"" (TASM) -- a film that was neither amazing nor about a man, and forget about any spiders -- that, while it's OK to do remakes, there should be a legitimate reason for them.  With that film I could see no reason for it, other than taking people's money.  But here, there surely was at least one reason:  the original ""Carrie"" was made so long ago that it was becoming somewhat dated, and special effects have really advanced.  I think that it would have been a bonus to perhaps change the tone here, and modify the themes slightly for differentiation.

The cast differences between this and the original are a mixed bag.  I really liked the Amy Irving character in the original; the actress here was (sorry) more than a step down.  I believe that Piper Laurie and Julianne Moore are a wash.  But I will give a slight nod perhaps to Chloe Grace Moretz, another actress that's very good for her age -- just like Ms. Ferland, discussed above -- as I found Ms. Moretz to be slightly more believable to me.

For me, with these types of films, you always have to suspend some belief.  Someone on this site once wrote that he hated the film ""The Conjuring"" because it wasn't real.  Well, of course it isn't.  The horror genre in particular is more for fright and entertainment than reality.  But here, they do make some unnecessary mistakes.  For example, the gym teacher slaps a student, and I wasn't convinced that that teacher wouldn't have been fired.  (Students have more power than teachers today, which boggles the mind.  I suppose I wish that we had that power when I was in high school, but then again, maybe not.)  And I believe that same student posts a video on YouTube that surely would have gotten her suspended, perhaps even sent to juvie.  I believe that there would have been a lawsuit as well.

But overall, is it a worthy remake?  And was there a reason for making it?  I'll give it a yes and a no.  Like I already wrote, I wished they would have changed up the themes a little bit more, so I'll go with slightly more than a weak recommendation here.  Sure, ""Not a Terrible Remake"" isn't a glowing endorsement, but as for remakes go, this one's pretty good.",1389830400,,3338,4.467768595041322
5377562,5,B00A2H9WW8,"THERES SOMETHING about Carrie White, the shy misfit created by Stephen King in his first published novel. This is the fourth film appearance inspired by the character, the first being a memorable 1976 outing starring Sissy Spacek as Carrie.

Emotionally and physically abused by her mother, Carrie is the target for bullies at school and in her neighborhood. Her situation reaches crisis level when she begins her first menstruation period in the gym shower. Without any education from her fanatically religious mother, Carrie believes shes bleeding to death. Her classmates respond viciously, throwing tampons and pads at the hysterical girl, telling her to Stop it up!

Then things get worse  for Carrie and everyone around her.

Reports of cyber-bullying and resulting teen suicides have been all over the news during the past few years, and director Kimberly Peirce (Boys Dont Cry, 1999; Stop-Loss, 2008) revises Carries story to cover this modern horror. It is an outstanding effort, on a par with the Spacek film that made audiences feel compassion and shriek with fright. Seriously, when I first saw the Spacek Carrie, there were people who screamed at the end scene, jumped from their seats, and ran for the exit. The woman sitting beside me tripped over my feet getting out.

The alternate ending available among the extras in Pieirces version won't do that. Smart decision to leave it out along with the other deleted scenes included on the Blu-ray. (The DVD only has the movie.) The new ending mirrors the sadness and sense of loss King creates in his book. Its not an easy task to pull off, but Peirce does it.

That could be because shes working from a good, tight script, refusing to be diverted. Shes also working with a perfect cast. Chol Grace Moretz of Kick-Ass and the American version of Let Me In plays Carrie in a flawless performance. (And she was only 15-years-old at filming!) Shes not as nave as Spaceks take, showing how times have changed. This Carrie is Internet savvy, using computers and the library to find out more about her sudden telekinetic powers. When popular girl Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) hatches the plan to have her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, charmingly played by Ansel Elgort, take Carrie to the prom, Carrie knows something is up. Unfortunately, her hopes of fitting in overcome her suspicions.

Pierce gives her opinion of the actors, Kings book  citing lines and scenes picked directly from the page  effects and motivations throughout her challenging commentary. What if Sue had simply apologized to Carrie for her role in the gym shower debacle and befriended her instead of setting up this elaborate prom escapade? Could be that, despite her guilt, Carrie is still an outcast and Sue won't take a chance on making friends. Pierce speculates the story might have ended much differently, without the blood and fire and death, if Sue had chosen differently.

On the other hand, Pierce tells us nearly everything in the film is a metaphor for sex, and has a skewed idea of what a horror movie fans like: I.E. violence, gore and sex. This is her first horror film; she used John Carpenters Halloween as a template to study. People are always punished after sex in horror movies, she says.

Also, Pierces sees Carrie as a love story between Carrie and her mother, Margaret White played by an intense Julianne Moore. Really? Margaret is as dangerous and crazy as they come; one of the tragedies of Carrie is how events at the prom drive the girl back to her mother just as the girl shows her first sign of independence. Does crazy, misplaced love still constitute a love story or heighten the horror?

Additional extras include a feature on telekinesis; Tina on Fire: Stunt Double Dailies, with commentary; a brief making-of, Creating Carrie; and Telekinetic Coffee Shop Surprise, a Carrie-like prank performed on customers in a caf.

5377563,3,B00A2H9WW8,"This remake is a perfect example of why some movies should not be remade. The original Carrie starred Sissy Spacek..who was brilliant as Carrie. Innocent but troubled, always on the edge. The mom in the original was sadistic and mean. A good, creepy movie.

This remake is so bad it's creepy. But, it is barely watchable. The lead has none of the vulnerability of Spacek. She is cute, but she simply seems shy. Not on the verge of madness. Juliane Moore (sp?) is the only redeeming performance. The timing and flow is awkward and none of the characters are developed so who cares when they get killed.

Just a bad movie. Don't waste your time. I am sorry I did.",1389830400,2,661,4.5

5377581,2,B00A2H9WW8,"Save for Piper Laurie in the old version, I actually liked the actors/actresses in this 2013 remake better than the original Carrie:  Chloe Moretz's Carrie White was one of even more vulnerability than Sissy Spacek's.  Also, Spacek struck me as just not being right for that role.  I like the PE teacher better in this round as opposed to that portrayed by Betty Buckley.  And, for a while, this film was competent enough to hold my interest.  However, the film making is a real letdown, and that is the key difference because the original is cinematic candy:  Split screens,  top notch photography, and the effective use of music and sound (remember the water hoses coiling like snakes in the original).  The original is so much more dangerous that this new one:  take the prom massacre, for example.  It really is unlike the old one in that Carrie's meltdown at Prom is more PC in this post-Colombine era.  Sissy Spacek took just about everyone out; this one was more targeted and less graphic.  Overall, this one left me unfulfilled.  But then again, it is hard to remake what I consider one of the best movies of all time.  The fact that the cast was superior in this movie is a testament to Brian DePalma's genius.",1389830400,3,1219,4.635514018691588

5377583,3,B00A2H9WW8,"I had high hopes for this newest remake... it simply fails. They didn't change much but what they did change are the subtle edginess of nearly every moment that pushed the original forward in alienating the main character Carrie. The political correctness of modern society, or the medias modern PC agenda has cleaned up every aspect of this film... the characters are all so thoughtful and hesitate to be realistic only to go that extra touchy feely step to soften up reality for our poor little Carrie.

I always thought they should have cast Dakota Fanning in this anyway, but Moretz? does an ok job... but I feel that Fanning would have pulled it off with much more sensitivity and neurotic flair. The final scenes of wrath do not pan out and do not equal the original at all. Overall it's much better than the previous Carrie 2? reboot, but not by much... it's watchable and to those unfamiliar with the original this might seem like a modern classic I suppose. But for an old original Carrie fan I feel it's just another failure to improve upon the material.",1389830400,2,1064,4.62962962962963

I do like Sissy Spacek's performance of Carrie a bit better than the Chloe Grace Mortez performance but I think it is because the first film made Carrie just a girl with telekinetic abilities.  This new version makes Carrie a girl with telekinetic ""Superpowers"".  I am a huge fan of Stephen King's book and I like the ending of the book better than either of the movie endings.  This movie is worth watching no matter what version you prefer.  The story of Carrie White is one that needs to be heard especially in light of all of the media headlines about children being tormented by other children.

5377599,5,B00A2H9WW8,"This is one of the Best Versions of Carrie I have seen.  I have seen the Original, The Rage Carrie 2, the Made for TV Version, and I was EAGERLY AWAITING this version when I heard they were doing it.  Happily and Joyfully I can admit this isn't a Shot For Shot Remake.  There is so much New Information that you get to see in this version.  From the opening Scene where you witness Margaret Giving Birth to Carrie to seeing how B!^&#y Chris Actually IS.  Watching Carrie actually Learning to Control her Power is nice too, We didn't get to see much of that in the other versions, cause it was just Minimally touched on.  You get to see how much Sue Regrets what they did and why she TRIES to do the right thing asking Tommy to take her to Prom.  We also get to see how Truly Psychotic Margaret is, and in this roll Julianne Moore Really SHINES.  In the Commentary Kimberly Peirce talks about how they worked Extensively with Chloe to Help her change from the ""Confident"" Girl we all know her as to the kind of girl that can be a Convincing Downcast Underdog this roll calls for, and she pulls off the roll SPLENDIDLY.  The Showdowns between Carrie and Margaret are Wonderful Visions to behold, from the fight over the Prom, to the night of the prom.  At this time I will say something about the Prom [but this isn't going to be a spoiler] is that in this version she isn't killing EVERYONE just cause they are there, She is Actually going after JUST the ones that caused the worst of the problems that brought her to her Breaking Point at Prom.  Any others that are hurt are not Intended.  There is a Nice Twist at the Ending which I won't even talk about, and if you want a scene close to the Original, you should get the Bluray so you can see the Alternate Ending, though it isn't like the Original Ending it is a little more....  Intense [for Sue at least].  If you don't want to see a Wonderful and Refreshing version of a classic that we all Know and Love [or if you aren't going to be open for some New Territory] then don't watch it.  However if you are anything like me who will give Anything a chance with an Open Mind then this is a movie that should NOT BE MISSED.  I love the Carrie Story so Much that I own All the Incarnations of the movie and love them all.  This is such a Wonderful and Refreshing telling of the story for a new generation.  And the way they deal with the subject of Bullying is updated to an even MORE CURRENT Problem, Cyber-bullying.  This truly is a movie that MUST BE SEEN.",1389744000,,2510,4.235294117647059

Anyway, in puts bullying and revenge in the spotlight. The movie has quite a few new twist to the original but at the end it was very, very good.",1389657600,,428,4.2317073170731705

So while I had never seen the original, I had a pretty good idea about what was supposed to happen.  That being said, my wife and I were blown away by this movie.  We thought the acting was very strong, the pacing was excellent, and as a whole it was very satisfying to watch Carrie get her revenge.  They really did a good job and developing the plot lines so that when the last 15 minutes of the movie happen, you actually are invested.  It was not what I expected because most horror films do not invest in their characters as most of them are just going to be dead anyway.  I think anyone who isn't hindered by constantly comparing it to the original will really enjoy this movie, and I must admit almost every negative review that I read did in fact compare it to the original.  I will finish and say that this is the best Psionic representation that I think I have seen since Akira.  I might classify the movie as more of a revenge flick than a horror flick, but all in all, it's definitely worth the time to see.",1389657600,,1218,4.153191489361702

5377626,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Every so often we get a remake of a horror classic, and most times they do not hold a candle to the original. Case in point Sam Peckinpah's classic Straw Dogs starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George. Other examples being Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, classics in the genre.

Occasionally though a worthwhile remake comes along such as I Spit on Your Grave or Last House on the Left which while the originals may not be classics they have gained a certain reputation, and a good way to explore the originals. I particularly liked the remake of John Carpenter's The Thing which can be seen as a precursor to the Alien movies, and I loved that they made the protagonist female.

Among the hardest acts to follow would be the remake of De Palma's original version of Carrie based on the Stephen King classic book which had a stellar cast including Sissy Spacek and John Travolta in a minor role. It has been a long time since I saw the original, and as I watched this remake starring Chloe Grace Moretz, at first I did start comparing it to the original but as I continued to watch I began to realize what a brilliant story this is, and how relevant it is as a metaphor for high school life today. The original has a surprise element which I have now seen many times with slight variations in other movies, an indicator of its huge influence..

Since the original movie in 1976 we have had many high school shootings. In some cases the perpetrators are marginalized or outsiders, treated as weird or even bullied by other kids with tragic consequences. So in some respects while Carrie is a tale of a girl with supernatural abilities, with a religious zealot for a mother, in this case played very ably by Julianne Moore, kept ignorant of the facts of life, and who is exploited and bullied by the other girls, and if you care to look at it on a deeper level it is a story of the reality of fitting and even surviving.

The story elements mesh together beautifully. We have the entitled bad girl cheerleader, the crazy mother, the girl with a conscience who regrets her participation, the supportive gym teacher, and the unfortunate girl who wants a shot at a normal life. Even though Carrie does bad things we get the sense that if things had gone only slightly differently she might have achieved that goal. If the prom were to go off without incident who knows what would be possible, but high school and the darker side of human nature can throw some serious curve balls.

I have to admit I was quite taken with this remake, and I loved the recurring symbolism of blood and roses of different colors throughout the movie. Does it hold a candle to the original? I think so, and it's updated to today's age to allow for social media expanding the level of humiliation possible to foist on a young girl.

Carrie did quite well at the Box Office opening to a $16 million weekend and achieving a highly respectable $35 million domestically and more than $82 million worldwide so far, from a $30 million production budget, with dvd sales yet to come.

I think most people will love it and I hope this was helpful.",1389657600,5,3130,4.519434628975265
5377627,4,B00A2H9WW8,Carrie was a real good remake this is the third installment of the original one I like the sound and special effects I could watch it over and over like the first one,1389657600,2,166,4.0606060606060606
5377628,3,B00A2H9WW8,"First off, this is not a horror film at all. It is a movie set in this time which is about high school and bullies. Today all we hear about on the news is about how someone bullied another student to make them kill themselves or shot someone in school or whatever. This movie is not scary at all and simply focuses on the character of Carrie and how other students treat her. That simple.

I really wish the mother would have been in it more, she was amazing when she was on the screen. It does have it's dark times, but it's put together to attract the late teen crowd and while it's entertaining the original is far superior in horror. This Carrie when in a completely different direction and while it's good, it's not really my style.

I blind bought it and I wish I hadn't as I'm unsure when I will watch this again. I recommend a rent first to see if you like the style and feel of the film. I couldn't get into the characters, besides Carrie, and the acting was a little on the light side.

PQ is decent, but a little cloudy at times. Seems like it could have been sharper but it could be a director intentional filter. The audio is good and when Carrie is going nuts the base is powerful.

5377632,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Although Stephen King was not crazy about the remake of the 1976 film ""Carrie"" which in turn was based on his first novel of the same name, ""Carrie-2013"" is still an excellent remake on a classic film that remains popular to this day.

 The script is pretty much the same as the first film which dramatizes the torture and bullying Carrie White goes through at her high school. To make matters worse she lives with her religious nut of a mother, played to perfection by Julianne Moore in a hair-raising performance.

 I think most will agree that Chloe Grace Moretz did a fine job in the Carrie role, but to me Sissy Spacek will always be the real Carrie. Spacek was actually nominated for an Academy Award for her performance, something of a rarity in that few horror roles ever get nominated by the Oscars.

 The film was a box office smash bringing in over $80.000,000!",1389571200,3,872,4.5576923076923075
5377633,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Unlike many people, I have no problems with remakes of classic films. Who's to say that someone else's take on a character or universe wouldn't offer something new to the cinematic world? I actually enjoyed the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and ""Fright Night"" reboots. The upcoming ""Robocop"" looks to be entertaining as well.

I especially don't mind alternate versions of movies when they were originally based on a novel. Many times, one screenwriter or director's interpretations of a book can be vastly different from another's. Just look at the difference between the two ""Total Recall,"" ""The Shining,"" and ""Salem's Lot"" movies and mini-series. Many have said one follows the author's writings much better than the other. Unfortunately, that doesn't always mean we get a better movie just because it's more faithful. That's the case with Director Kimberly Peirce's vision of ""Carrie.""

Carrie's (Chloe Grace Moretz) life can only be described as miserable and lonely. An outcast in school, she finds no solace at home. Her overbearing mother (Julianne Moore) is a misled and overzealous religious nut that constantly condemns Carrie and everyone around her for the sins they have and will commit. When the young girl finds she possesses telekinetic powers, it opens up a whole new world to her. It won't be long before both her psychotic mother and bullying classmates will regret everything they've ever said and done to Carrie.

Several things are wrong with ""Carrie."" First off, it's very hard to buy Chloe Grace Moretz as a ""Plain Jane"" girl who is the blight of the school and the outcast everyone picks on. She's too cute to be playing this kind of character. That's not to say she didn't do her best in the role. I just think she was miscast.

Secondly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a made-for-TV movie through much of ""Carrie."" The camerawork and overall look reminded me of something I'd see on Lifetime. It's passible, but doesn't give the movie the cinematic feel it should have.

2013's ""Carrie"" does take viewers in a couple different directions that weren't explored in Brian De Palma's version of the story. However, that doesn't necessarily translate into being a good thing. Moretz's portrayal of Carrie doesn't leave the audience with the sense of empathy Sissy Spacek's did in the first adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller.

The title character's telekinetic powers are much more fantastical in the new ""Carrie."" Instead of just being able to move things with her mind, she can also stop cars in their tracks, fly, and cause the ground to split open. Whether more accurate to the book or not, these powers feel like a bit much and don't hold up well on film.

Finally, some of the special effects and CGI were less than spectacular. My biggest complaint is that the explosions suffered from looking a bit too artificial. More time in the image editing process could have cleaned these issues up.

The real diamond in the rough when it comes to ""Carrie"" is Julianne Moore. Her portrayal of Margaret White is absolutely wonderful and disturbing. She perfectly captures the desperation and lunacy the character bounces through with complete sincerity.

""Carrie"" is rated R for bloody violence, disturbing images, language, and some sexual content. It's definitely gory enough for a restricted rating. There's one scene where two teens are having sex that was unnecessary. They didn't show any nudity, but it was still too much. If it weren't for that scene, this could easily have been rated PG-13.

I really respected the way Bible-based Christianity isn't thrown under the bus in 2013's ""Carrie."" As the mother is spouting off religious banter, Carrie points out that what the mother is reciting isn't even found in the Bible. This gives viewers a clearer picture that Margaret isn't practicing traditional living through scripture. Her beliefs are more cult-like and not limited to true Biblical teachings.

The DVD edition of ""Carrie"" contains a few special features. They include a making-of featurette entitled ""Bringing Back Carrie."" A featurette entitled ""Telekinetic Coffee Shop Surprise"" and a theatrical trailer are found as well.

2013's ""Carrie"" isn't going to please people who loved Brian De Palma's version. It might be more accurate to Stephen King's written word, but it lacks the tension and emotion of the 1976 film. However, it will appeal to those who never saw the first screen adaptation of the book and teenagers will find it easy to relate to. It's safe to say they'll definitely think twice before bullying someone in the future after watching this.",1389571200,12,4639,5.033898305084746

She had hopes, she had fears, but we pushed her and you can only push someone so far before they break."" Carrie White (Moretz) is an awkward outcast at her school and a daughter of an overbearing mother (Moore) at home. Carrie also has a special power that she tries to keep hidden but you can only hide your true self for so long. I have been saying for a long long time now that Hollywood is out of ideas. If it's not a comic book movie then it seems remakes of TV shows and old movies are all that is being made. Going in to this I wasn't that excited because 9 out of 10 times the remakes are awful. This one is the 10th one. It has been awhile since I have seen the original but I really did end up enjoying this one. Moretz I think is a perfect choice for this role but Spacek did play it creepier. Also much like the original the mother is the creepiest part of this movie, mainly because she could really exist. Although I haven't seen the original in awhile from what I remember they didn't really change too much of it for this one. Depending on how you feel that is either a good thing or a bad thing. For me I'd prefer staying true to the original rather then changing something just to change it. That said I would also prefer an original movie over all of it. Overall, one of the best remakes to come out in a long time. I liked it more then I expected. I give this a B+.",1389398400,3,1459,4.017182130584192
5377650,4,B00A2H9WW8,this girl is a good actress for starter. I mean she just got done filming in kick ass 2 and then hop on another that's what sup. but this was  good due to her having power to use to move things. I just the people just wasn't treating her so bad but since they were they got what they deserve for what they did and said to her. However it did have it moment were I was like shut the talking and get back to the action. Hopefully they make a second and it be way more action.

Pierce did an amazing job leading up to the prom scene and making the audience hope for a different outcome than the one given. This movie definitely lives up to the 1976 version. In my opinion it was better, but I'm judging based on this film's own merit. I didn't compare it to the 76 version and I think more people would like it if they could watch it with an open mind.",1389398400,,509,4.204081632653061

This movie was just okay but may have been better if they had called it Carrie 2 and change the storyline. The duplication just wanted me to cut the movie off and pop in the old Carrie since nothing surprising happens and the acting is subpar to 1974 Carrie. But then again part II of all movies and movie replications, in my opinion, are never as good as the original.

5377674,5,B00A2H9WW8,"This IS Carrie brought to life.  The best Carrie movie in existence.  It is so much like the novel, that I am proud to give it 5 stars.

Moretz and Moore become their characters in such a frighteningly real way that you will be entranced by their performances.  Moore is horrifying all on her own.  When Carrie comes into her powers, we get a layer of scares to place on top of the already heart-breaking lunacy of her mother.  Just a great experience with a lot of suspense and tension.

The effects are perfect.  The violence is tense, bloody, and disturbing.  The movie is perfectly paced, and it does justice to Stephen King's wonderful novel.  What else could you ask for from a novel adaptation?

Buy it, if you are a Stephen King fan or horror fan in general.  And PRAY for a sequel.  They did a great job here.",1389225600,,818,4.373333333333333
5377675,3,B00A2H9WW8,"My thoughts on this film was sketchy. The remake was not so bad, but was not what I had entirely expected. We see the good: they stuck to the original story most of the way, the actors were fanomaly great, especually for most of the cast being teenagers, and there is h*** to raise from this girls anger (not going to say it for purposes better left not to get into). There is also the bad from this film: unlike Psycho's 1998 remake, it was not an exact stick-to-the-original-script remake, so there are changes and not EVERYONE suffers, only the bad apples of the bunch. Wheres the fun in that? So it seems more like a tale of revenge than fear. Finally, we have the ugly: as said before, it did not stick entirly to the story, so changes were made, some good and some bad, like for good changes, Carries ""cries for help"" are put online, so we feel like the film IS up to date, but for bad changes, she is more agressive using her powers, where as the Carrie we know was more scared and a bit shy of using them (until she has her meltdown), plus, when your watching the film, you don't mind watching the who thing progress, but you will always keep telling yourself ""LETS SEE HER GET MAD ALREADY!""

We can compare the film and remakes to that of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (since they were made in the same years as each other: '76,'02, and '13), The original Carrie was best of the trio, like TCM, the first remake was not too shabby, but not better, but unlike 2013's TCM, 2013 Carrie was held together quite nicely, Where as the 2013 Texas Chainsaw Massacure was an absolute fail (to people who have seen the others).

So there you have it folks. This film is not the greatest remake, but not a fail. It has the good, the bad, and the ugly.",1389225600,4,1742,4.307926829268292

5377683,5,B00A2H9WW8,"It REALLY does come down to your opinion. Mine is, well I enjoyed it. I love the original 1971 version, and the 2002 version. I also read the book. But I just really enjoyed this version because it took a different approach.

I like how they updated it, and also I felt the acting was incredible. Chloe as Carrie was incredible, and Moore was, in my opinion, Emmy award worthy for her role as the mother.

In fact, she's my favorite version of Carrie's mother. She was so over the top and crazy, it's like they were not restrained by how crazy they could make her, they went full out.

Another thing I have to note I loved was a scene after the Prom. When Kris and Billy are driving away, we actually get to see Carrie really torture those bastards.

In the 1971 version, we see their car blow up, and that's it. It's over rather quick, too quick really. It's almost anti-climatic. Kris was the leader of the bullies, and she's the one we really wanted to see suffer Carrie's wrath.

But in this version, we really get to see it. It's not rushed and it even drags out a little bit. Carrie kills Billy first, torturing Kris emotionally, and then even LIFTS the car up with her powers and then kills Kris.

Honestly, it's the death scene of Kris I wanted to see for years.

Another thing I thought was a cool add was how Carrie's powers seem stronger in this version. Like how she cracks the earth, lifts a car, etc. Some people saw this as stupid or unrealistic, meh maybe it is, but I really thought it was badass and cool.

The teacher is also awesome in this version, but tbh my favorite teacher is still the one from the 1971 original. Mainly because we actually get to see her really taunt those bullies when they're in her detention.

Sadly we don't get that in this version, but this teacher still is very good.

Another thing I liked, is how Carrie somewhat stands up to her mom early on. How she corrects her on bible verses and makes quite the point, saying how ""God is merciful and loves everyone"". As a Christian, I was impressed how they openly had Carrie throw that back in her mom's face.

As far as Sue goes, I really this actress's approach. She was really good in this version.

I'm not sure if her pregnancy really had any point in the movie. It doesn't really hurt the story in any way, but it is a little pointless. But if it doesn't hurt the story, I'll give it a pass, its an interesting add on.

Overall, I cannot really pick a favorite version. I enjoy all three versions, but I really just love the approach in this one. It's not for everyone, but if you want to see all versions, then go for it.",1388707200,,2621,4.292089249492901

The sad part is that very few remakes can even come close to the greatness of the originals. Stop ruining good films with horrible remakes and give us something new and original.

The Rage: Carrie 2 (1999) I've only seen it a handful of times it's enjoyable I dig it
Carrie (2002) tv version --The tv version is a very unique take on it Check it out-- Good for a tv budget Flick!
Now Carrie (2013)
That being said I was very much torn about seeing this Flick Cause I know how powerful it is

My thoughts on Carrie (2013)
for those that didn't see a point in a re-make it's NOT a remake
It's more of a very strong Update!
With a very strong female cast
Julianne Moore is scary good (Maybe one of most talented actress of her generation!)
Chloe Moretz really made the Carrie role her own (She is far from a villain or even evil She is a true victim that snaps) In a very dark horrific way
and Judy Greer is so under-rated in Hollywood (it's a real shame )
Director Kimberly Peirce really did a great job with the source material very dark and not politically incorrect
One scene makes no sense with the one the main ""evil"" girls hanging out with her other trashy girlfriend and her white trash boy friend (where they like do this weird 3-sum reference) I didn't see the point of it?!?!
The F/X effects mostly digital look pretty good (some a lil off) But, can be forgiven
There are a few slow motion scenes that work so good! Plus seeing the High School up in flames while Carrie is walking away from the school is jarring!
My only problem with it is the ending with Carrie White's tombstone with spray paint over her name reading ""Carrie Burn in Hell""
which isn't realistic much like the original with the spray paint too (Never understood why this was used Cause it takes you out of the movies
Everyone knows the story but, in this day and age with cyber bulling and all the insanity in America
The film is a social commentary on high school peer pressure, Conditioning, Abuse, Religion, & cliques along with much more
it's still digs deep in your head and haunts you in such a primitive manor
you won't forget her name anytime soon....
There is a reason why there has been 4 Incarnations of this book (It goes into very deep subject matter that all of us as a society need to talk about)

5377690,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Basically, you have a reimagining of the classic horror tale about Carrie White, a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom.  What makes this superior is the casting of Chlo Grace Moretz, as Carrie White.  Yes, the mean girl classmates are super mean, her mother is an over the top Religious Zealot, stupidly forcing her beliefs on Carrie (and Julianne Moore, as her mother, really knows how to play stupid).  The most amazing character about actress Chlo Grace Moretz, is the way she transforms herself as character Carrie.  One moment, she is mild, introverted Carrie then when she finds her powers, she is totally changed.  What really sets the version apart from the others, is we become engrossed, mesmerized, and hypnotized by Carrie (Chlo Grace Moretz).  Yes, the Computer-generated imagery is a little to much and distracting at times.

It is a reimagining of the classic 1974 Stephen King novel of the same name. In my opinion, it is the most appropriate version for modern audiences and the second best of the film adaptations (after the groundbreaking 1976 release which was the first horror film to use a twist ending). The 2013 version of Carrie is focused more on drama than horror. The Blu-ray comes with an alternate cut that has a different ending (101 minutes) and the original theatrical cut (100 minutes). Overall, the picture and audio quality are fantastic. There is 40 minutes of total bonus content plus an audio commentary. You get a Blu-ray, DVD, and an UltraViolet digital copy (which unlocks only the theatrical cut) in this release. As a bonus, Carrie comes in collectible lenticular packaging (lenticular refers to an animated surface that produces a 3D optical effect to make it look like the picture is moving).

Carrie (2013) is another remake of the Stephen King classic, this time starring Chloe Moretz as Carrie White.  The original movie from 1976 (starring Sissy Spacek as Carrie White) is excellent, one of my favorite horror movies of all time.  The 2002 TV remake (starring Angela Bettis as Carrie White) was fair at best.  This 2013 remake is the better of the two remakes, but not by much (I gave the 2002 movie 3 stars and the 1976 original 5 stars).  I had a hard time buying Chloe Moretz in the role of Carrie White, though she does a decent job and has some moments of brilliance.  She's too attractive looking for the role.  In contrast, Sissy Spacek was perfectly cast in the original and Angela Bettis was a good casting choice in the 2002 movie.  Julianne Moore does a good job as Carrie's mother, but I prefer Piper Laurie from the original.  This 2013 movie is even more over the top than the 2002 movie with the special effects.  The 1976 movie got it just right.  I highly recommend that movie.

Anyway, it's inevitable that people are going to compare and contrast the three versions of this movie, and I'm no exception.  I rank them as follows:

1. Carrie 1976 - 5 stars
2. Carrie 2002 - 3 stars
3. Carrie 2013 - 4 stars",1387411200,3,1367,4.455645161290323
5377693,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Ever since I was a kid, Carrie has been one of my favorite horror movies and I was psyched for the remake. Chloe Moretz was absolutely the perfect choice to play Carrie. She should win an Award! The makers of this film claim it's truer to the book, but it seemed more like a tribute to the original movie. There were a few things from the book that they added that weren't in the original like Sue's pregnancy, Chris's dad being a lawyer and the rain of stones. (I think most truest version is the 2002 TV remake with Angela Bettis) I loved Chloe's facial expressions during the Prom massacre. She looked psychotic and was enjoying getting her 'revenge' on her classmates.

Carrie White is a shy misunderstood teen who constantly gets bullied by Chris Hargensen and her group. When Carrie gets her first period in the gym locker room, all the girls laugh and mock her. Sue Snell feels bad about this and asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to prom. When Chris drops pigs blood on Carrie at the prom, all hell breaks loose!

That's true, and nobody can deny that Sissy Spacek is a great actor, but Chloe Moretz's take on the character is so different from Spacek's, that the new film is well worth seeing for Moretz's performance alone. Much like her under-appreciated performance in ""Hick,"" her work here is extraordinary. Whereas Spacek was distant and somewhat cold (and in the end, genuinely creepy), Moretz is much more sympathetic and relatable, and therefore the feel of the whole film is much more emotional; this is a drama, not a horror film.

5377709,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Tonight, I watched the screening of the new film adaptation of Stephen King's novel, ""CARRIE"". At first I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't as faithful to the Stephen King novel as I hoped it would have been, but that's to be expected when you've been a devoted fan of the novel for almost ten years. After watching it on the big screen tonight, I can confidentially say that it definitely stands on its own as a solid film. My only disappointment is the running time of the theatrical cut. The pacing is good and quick, but it felt as though it could have been longer to flesh out the characters and tell the story properly. I do know for a fact that a lot of scenes were filmed, but were dropped from the theatrical cut during the editing process. Kimberly Peirce said in a interview that the original cut of the film was longer and a lot different than what we saw in theatres. I just hope the studios release a 'Director's Cut' on DVD and Blu-ray sometime down the track.

Chloe Grace Moretz (Carrie White) and Julianne Moore (Margaret White) give a solid performance and make their leading characters their own. Judy Greer (Miss Desjardin), Ansel Elgort (Tommy Ross), Gabriella Wilde (Sue Snell), Alex Russell (Billy Nolan) and Portia Doubleday (Chris Hargensen) give a solid performance and make their secondary characters their own. Director Kimberly Peirce does an excellent job focusing on the mother and daughter relationship, as well as the bullying aspect of the story. Composer Marco Beltrami delivers an incredible score which is hauntingly beautiful and unique in its own way. Cinematographer Steve Yedlin does a phenomenal job with the visuals throughout the film. There are a lot of scenes that are psychologically disturbing and emotionally moving -- it definitely makes you feel for Carrie. Even though there are a number of similarities to Brian De Palma's 1976 film, I do believe that Kimberly Peirce's film captured the true essence of the Stephen King novel.

I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but I personally don't see ""Carrie"" as a typical Horror story. Having a final jump scare just diminishes the point of the story. It cheapens it. Since it's more of a character-driven story, I see it as a Drama (maybe Thriller?) with elements of Horror. Yes, Stephen King's work is known as ""Horror"" or ""Thriller"", but the story of Carrie just doesn't fit into the Horror genre by today's standards. Lawrence D. Cohen and Brian De Palma took the novel and turned it into a generic Horror film. I think that's why a lot of people have classified the story as ""Horror"" -- it's implanted in their mind. If you dissect the novel layer by layer, you will see that it's a tragedy culminating to a horrific event. And what's scary is the realism of the story: religious fanaticism, sexuality, bullying, abuse, revenge, etc. How many incidents have we seen in the past where people take matters into their own hands after being pushed too far? It's a timeless story that fits in any era.

Do I believe that it was necessary for the story to have been re-adapted for a new generation? Yes. Today, bullying has become a major issue in our society, especially on social media. Take a look at the school shootings and teenage suicides that has occurred over the years. Remember the Columbine massacre that happened in 1999? Two boys were treated as outcasts by their high school peers and in the end they were hellbent on revenge. The same thing applies with Carrie White. Yes, it may be a fictional story of a girl with telekinetic powers, but it does make you stop and think. She was an outcast at school who was regularly tormented by her peers. She suffered emotional and physical abuse from her overly religious mother. And in the end... it was a tragedy. I just hope people take heed of the dangers of bullying and understand that a person can only be pushed so far before they break.

I genuinely believe that ""CARRIE"" stands alone as a solid film and highly recommend that people watch this with an open mind. The 1976 film was a horror, this is a tragedy.

UPDATE!
Here's a bit of information regarding the film...

Having read the original screenplay by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, I can safely say that the original script didn't follow the same structure as the 1976 film. I will admit there were a few homages, but it was a whole new take on the story. Before the film was delayed in January 2013, there was a lot of positive feedback from those who attended the first test screenings in December 2012. A number of people confirmed that the original cut was longer and a lot different than the theatrical cut.

I remember watching a video on YouTube where two guys reviewed the film (without giving away spoilers) based on what they saw at the test screenings. They confirmed that the film was a lot different to Brian De Palma's film and was more closer to the Stephen King novel. I personally believe that the studios interfered with the editing of the film. The theatrical cut wasn't what Kimberly Peirce wanted to release in theatres. It's like they [the studios] re-cut the film and gave us a scene-by-scene remake of Brian De Palma's film. I knew it wasn't Kimberly's voice in the movie -- it was the studios.

A friend of mine, who is a filmmaker, gave their two cents as to what might have happened...

The original cut was all ready to go in March, then the studios looked at the release date and thought they could make more money on ""Carrie"" during the Halloween season. So they demanded re-shoots and multiple re-edits to make it more Horror. It would explain why Lawrence D. Cohen (the writer of the 1976 film) was credited after the film was delayed -- they re-shot a number of scenes from the 1976 screenplay. The downside to the re-shoots and multiple re-edits is that a lot of scenes would have to be dropped or trimmed to fit the new running time by the studios. The shorter the film, the more viewing sessions the film has.

Based on fan speculation, test audience feedback, and certain confirmed details concerning the film -- the deleted and/or extended scenes include:

-The original opening was a flashback of Carrie as a little girl spying through a fence on a female neighbor who is sunbathing. The young woman notices Carrie and starts to make conversation with her. Carrie tells her that she can see her ""dirty pillows"" and the neighbor explains to her that it is normal for women to develop breasts when they get older. That's when Margaret White appears and snatches up Carrie, screaming and yelling at the neighbor. She calls the young lady a whore, telling her to stay away from her child, and Carrie gets upset and begins to cry. Suddenly, it starts hailing. Pellets of ice come down on top of Carrie's home while Margaret runs into the house trying to console her daughter. The neighbor just stares in disbelief as the hail rains down on the White residence, and only the White residence.

-The White Commission [The film had integrated several courtroom scenes with witnesses giving testimonies of their experiences with Carrie White leading to the prom incident, essentially structuring the film as a series of flashbacks and recollections. The neighbor from the alternate opening scene is shown at first, now an adult woman, recounting her experience. There is also a scene featuring a TK Specialist discussing telekinesis and saying something to the effect of Carrie being one of many people who may be born with this genetic anomaly. It's been said that the White Commission scenes revealed too many prom survivors which the filmmaker's felt spoiled the climax]

-There was 'found footage' that played a role in the film. That's why you see Freddy 'Beak' Holt carrying his camera and filming everything.

-There were scenes detailing more in depth character development.

-There were scenes involving Facebook, the e-mail sent from Chris to Donna Kellogg. ""So I'm out of prom and my [censored] father says he won't give them what they deserve.""

-""Wipe that smile off your face."" - Chris to Carrie at the pool.

-The locker room scene [Extended] - Chris turning the cell-phone toward herself and the mean girls.

-Chris and Tina kiss [Extended]

-Tommy and Sue's backseat sex scene [Extended]

-Billy's wild ride [The ""blow--- scene"" - similar to the 1976 version]

-An interaction between Chris and Carrie outside the dress shop.

-The confrontation between Sue and the mean girls.

-Carrie levitates Margaret [Extended]

-Drive to the pig farm [Extended]

-After Tommy leaves the table to get some drinks, Carrie and Miss Desjardin have a friendly and meaningful conversation.

-Carrie and Tommy kiss.

-Billy kisses Chris.

-Margaret claws her way out of the closet and goes over to the sink where she retrieves a butcher knife and cuts herself.

-Sue tries to call Tommy from outside the school to warn him that something bad is about to happen. He rejects the call.

-The prom scene as a whole, which was said to be longer and more violent than the theatrical version.

-Tina on fire [Extended]

-A scene or shot which reveals George Dawson and his girlfriend's fate.

-There were some really creepy stuff that was unfortunately cut during post-production, like some ""dancing"" dead students. My source is not completely certain about this detail or its placement within the film. But it was either in a deleted scene where Carrie snaps the limbs of prom-goers or during the electrocution scene which was supposed to be more graphic and longer. In the novel, it was described as a ""crazy puppet dance"".

-The scene of Carrie levitating outside of the burning school was actually re-shot. In the original version of that scene, Carrie was standing on the centre of the lawn, waiting for the remaining surviving students to come out of the burning school before killing them one by one with her telekinetic powers.

-After Carrie leaves the school, she begins to destroy part of the town by causing explosions and bringing down power lines as she follows Billy and Chris. You can see the first few seconds of the town destruction from the aerial view. If you look closely behind Carrie, you can see that several cars are in flames.

-When Sue is outside the school with Miss Desjardin, she sees Tommy's body being carried out on a stretcher. Miss Desjardin tells Sue that she's sorry and Sue walks away with determination to find Carrie.

-Margaret's original death scene - possibly similar to the book version which depicts a heart attack caused by Carrie's power.

-The multiple endings

1) The first ending is very similar to the ending of the 1976 film but without the final twist: Sue Snell actually gets killed when Carrie pulls her into the ground.

2) The second ending is an exact replica of the original film where Snell gets pulled into the ground by Carrie but wakes up in her bed to find it's just a dream.

3) The third ending is after Carrie saves Sue by pushing her out of the house, which collapses from the falling stones. There's a bird's eye view of the wreckage of what used to be Carrie's home before we get a quick CGI zoom through a pit of debris, to a close-up of a now bloodied Carrie snapping her eyes open.

4) The fourth ending is of Sue making a final speech to the court where she says the line heard in the teaser trailer about Carrie being just a girl, not a monster. This is spoken over scenes of Sue and her family visiting the cemetery. Sue goes to Carrie's grave, which shows the headstone tagged up and vandalized. She leaves her flowers and just walks away. Nothing scary, just a very somber closing shot of the headstone.

5) The fifth ending is after Carrie's house is destroyed by the falling stones. The movie flashes forward to several months later and we see Sue in the hospital surrounded by doctors and nurses, ready to give birth. They're trying to calm her down but Sue begins to struggle, saying she feels something is wrong. Suddenly, a very bloody hand (covered in afterbirth) erupts from between Sue's legs, reaching up and gripping her arm. She screams in terror and we see that she is having a nightmare, being held down by her parents while the camera pans over to a wall where we are shown a large crucifix hanging in her room.

6) The sixth ending is described as a ""morning after voice over"" by Sue Snell as we see the town coping with what happened.

7) The seventh ending shows the town the morning after Carrie's attack filled with news crews, reporters, and cops talking about the whole thing. What's bizarre about this scene is that Carrie's destruction of the city is being described as ""a conspiracy."" Apparently the town is ""trying to cover up what really happened.""

There is an online petition for a Director's Cut to be released. The petition has gained almost 10,000 signatures (I think?), so I'm curious to see how that will turn out.",1386547200,99,12878,4.723907225691347

5377711,5,B00A2H9WW8,"This was a GREAT movie! I absolutely love it! Chloe Grace Moretz was a great Carrie. I am definitely buying this the day it comes out on DVD/Blu Ray. This movie is Carrie for this generation. Most of you might think ""This is just going to another stupid horror remake."" But it really isn't. After I saw the movie, I read the book, and this version of the movie is more related to the book the 1970's version and the 2002 version (Not 100% sure when the first remake came out). If you love Stephen King and horror movies then you will definitely love this. I know this movie got bashed in reviews by the critics, but the critics also look for The Godfather in movies, when it comes to this movie, do NOT listen to the critics. This movie is WAY better then both of the previous versions of the book. I HIGHLY recommend this movie! Most people know what the story of Carrie is so I'll give it a brief description. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Carrie,a 17-18 year old high school student who is tormented by her classmates,along with a VERY religious mother. As the movie goes along,Carrie finds about her new found telekinetic powers known as telekinesis. In the beginning of the movie, Carrie has her period and doesn't know what it is cause her mother never told her about it. She starts bleeding from the area and she thinks she's bleeding to death. She then tries to go to her classmates for help but all they do is laugh and start a chant ""Plug it up"", telling her to plug up the area with a tampon. Then throughout the movie, one of her classmates Sue Snell , who was in the chant starts to feel really bad for what she did, but another classmate Chris Hargensen , is not so forgiving. Chris then starts getting in trouble for what she did to Carrie, but she doesn't think she did anything wrong. Chris then gets suspended and not allowed to go to prom. While on the other hand Carrie is learning about her powers. Sue then asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross to take Carrie to prom cause of how bad she feels for what they did in the locker room. Tommy then asks Carrie to prom and Carrie agrees. To get ""revenge"",Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan decide to go to a farm, kill a pig then drain the blood. While at the prom, Carrie and Tommy get elected prom king and queen. While Carrie and Tommy are on the stage Chris and Billy dump the bucket of pigs blood on to Carrie, then the bucket falls, hits Tommy in the head, killing him. Carrie then wreaks havoc on the school and kills multiple of her classmates. Hoped this review helped and hope you watch Carrie, you will NOT be disappointed!!!!",1386288000,5,2592,4.357438016528926
5377712,5,B00A2H9WW8,"The thing to realize here is that people are mistaking this for a 2002 version that was made for TV. I did not see that, as I could never understand how something like Carrie could be properly represented in a made for TV movie.

This version was recently in theaters and stared Chlo Grace Moretz as Carrie. I saw it, and felt that it holds as a very solid remake with updates really only used as needed.
The insanity of the mother and the hate from the other people in school are properly represented here.
There is more caring given from the gym teacher and much more ruthlessness from the mother. I felt that Chlo Grace Moretz showed a lot of emotion just from here eyes when needed. That's something that isn't seen much if at all anymore.

If I could rate in half stars, I would give this 4.5 simply because of one scene where the CGI is obvious. Other then that, I really can't complain.",1386288000,9,893,4.341317365269461

Going through all the thoughts and feelings that teenage girls go through.  Now imagine that you've held in rage for such a long time and have been mentally abused by your mother and kids at school.

Would you make them all pay for what they did, or would you just let it continue to go on and be abused?  Welcome to the problem that Carrie is facing.

My mom and I went to see this.  I've never seen the original.  I very much enjoyed the movie.  First, the girl who plays Carrie, was amazing.  She played the innocent, scared girl SO well.  I actually almost cried at a few parts because I felt so bad for her.  She was amazing.  The lady who plays the mom also did a great job of playing the strict, scared mom.  The entire cast was very believable.  I have to applaud them all.

Something else that was cool were the effects.  The scene with the blood on her, it just starts floating in the air.  Very cool.  Many things happen and the effects look great throughout.

I like simple movies.  While this was not simple as far as how or why she could do what she did or what was going on in her mind, it was simple in the fact that everything really took place at her house or at the school.  That is easy to understand.  Those were the two places she was hurt the most.  You get to see her realize that she has to make her own decisions.  Only to have everything end in a bang.

The film starts out very strange; almost to the point of you wanting to look away from the screen. Nonetheless we are soon introduced to Carrie (Chloe Moretz): shy, quiet, and an outcast. She is often teased, and when she is not being teased she is being kept up by her overly religious mom. And soon enough, Carrie comes to slowly understand why she is not like everyone else. You see the things that happen in this movie. And you want the conflict resolved. And for the most part, the conflict in the story is resolved exactly how you would expect it to be.

The acting in this movie is top notch. Chloe Moretz embodies the character of Carrie extremely well. Julianne Moore had a very realistic approach playing Carrie's mom. Supporting cast was good too.

All in all, while Carrie is once again a movie I would not consider to be scary or terryfing, it is a film that is quite enjoyable and exciting to watch. You are in for quite a surprise. Definitely one I will buy when it releases on dvd.

5377727,3,B00A2H9WW8,"The 2013 remake of ""Carrie"" is not really a bad film. You know, with Chlo Grace Moretz as the titular heroine Carrie White, it just cannot be. The problem is, I see no point in remaking or ""re-imagining"" the 1970s cult classic.

Those who have seen the 1976 original directed by Brian De Palma know the story. It is about a 17-year-old girl Carrie White (Chlo Grace Moretz), bullied and abused, who suddenly discover that she has a special power. In the meanwhile, a girl banned from the prom concocts a plan with her boyfriend, to humiliate Carrie in front of the students.

The director is Kimberly Peirce of ""Boys Don't Cry"" fame, and she clearly thinks, rightly, that ""Carrie"" is more than just a scary tale. It is also a sad coming-of-age story about a lonely soul, and Chlo Grace Moretz becomes one in a very convincing way - when the film does not overuse the special effects.

For visual effects are a little disappointing during and after the famous prom scene. Also, Chlo Grace Moretz, talented as she is, may be a little miscast as Carrie White, who looks less creepy and menacing than the one played by Sissy Spacek.

As you expect, Julianne Moore steals scenes as Carrie's abusive mother, but the rest of the supporting players are not very memorable. After all it is Carrie who takes the center stage, but what she does there is no longer astonishing or shocking.",1384128000,12,1377,4.608163265306122
5377728,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Many people wonder ""What's the point?  I know this story.""  That's true, and nobody can deny that Sissy Spacek is a great actor, but Chloe Moretz's take on the character is so different from Spacek's, that the new film is well worth seeing for Moretz's performance alone.  Much like her under-appreciated performance in ""Hick,"" her work here is extraordinary.  Whereas Spacek was distant and somewhat cold (and in the end, genuinely creepy), Moretz is much more sympathetic and relatable, and therefore the feel of the whole film is much more emotional; this is a drama, not a horror film.  Perhaps you don't know this story after all. . .",1383350400,5,639,4.825688073394495

I recall watching the original Carrie in the theater. That surprise ending literally had people jumping out of their chairs. This one put me to sleep.

5377730,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Ever since I was a kid, Carrie has been one of my favorite horror movies and I was psyched for the remake. Chloe Moretz was absolutely the perfect choice to play Carrie.

There were a few things from the book that they added that weren't in the original like Sue's pregnancy, Chris's dad being a lawyer and the rain of stones. (I think most truest version is the 2002 TV remake with Angela Bettis) I loved Chloe's facial expressions during the Prom massacre. She looked psychotic and was enjoying getting her 'revenge' on her classmates.

Carrie White is a shy misunderstood teen who constantly gets bullied by Chris Hargensen and her group. When Carrie gets her first period in the gym locker room, all the girls laugh and mock her. Sue Snell feels bad about this and asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to prom. When Chris drops pigs blood on Carrie at the prom, all hell breaks loose!

Remakes are always at a disadvantage and usually need to bring a little something different for the audience. Other than the lead actresses performance there are two things that stand out in my mind that elevates this version; one is the creative use of her powers, and two and most important, Carrie has a much better reason for losing it at the end, and not only does she not harm her friends she protects them. This makes her a much more sympathetic character than the original.

If I had any complaint at all I'd say that Carrie's home-life should have been shown as a little more oppressive and abusive than it was. Other than that, a very entertaining remake.",1382918400,2,943,4.541176470588235
5377732,5,B00A2H9WW8,"First, I would like to emphasize this is more like a DRAMA than a horror picture even though it's based on a novel of Stephen King. So, if you're looking for a lot of blood and killing after killing, you'll be disappointed.

Second, below is my opinion.

When I first saw its trailer in the theater, I thought it was boring, and it offered nothing new compared to the old film. So, when my friend asked me to go to this movie with him, I did not want to. However, I gave in because I favored socializing over movies. It turned out my first impression was completely wrong.

The special effects in the last scene were impressive and bloody.

The plot evolved from bullying and mental abuse. They were not new materials but the directing and acting made them enjoyable and believable. The director gave the actors enough time to develop their characters.

The acting of Julianne Moore, Chloe Grace Moretz , and Portia Doubleday was superb. They made the movie feel so real, suspenseful, touching and in some cases unbearable.
Julianne was convincingly scary as a mom.
Portia was credibly tormenting as a bully.
Chloe was excellent in the role of an outwardly submissive person. Her character, Carrie, had my sympathy even though I do not believe in killing people. As Gandhi said: ""An eye for an eye makes the world go blind"".
The scene where Carrie was humiliated, and bullied in the washroom was brutal, terrifying and touching. Now, it touches me much more when I found out something like that did happen in reality as  revealed in the true crime show Dead Ringer - Elina and Christina.

Of course, it had some logical holes but they don't affect its entertaining value.

In short, it's one of the BEST that my MONEY can GET in terms of Drama, Gripping and Touching acting. It's definitely worth watching.",1382918400,3,1806,4.6572327044025155

Now Carrie (2013)
That being said I was very much torn about seeing this Flick Cause I know how powerful it is

My thoughts on Carrie (2013)
for those that didn't see a point in a re-make it's NOT a remake
It's more of a very strong Update!
With a  very strong female cast
Julianne Moore is scary good (Maybe one of most talented actress of her generation!)
Chloe Moretz really made the Carrie role her own (She is far from a villain or even evil She is a true victim that snaps) In a very dark horrific way
and Judy Greer is so under-rated in Hollywood (it's a real shame )
Director  Kimberly Peirce  really did a great job with the source material  very dark and not politically incorrect
One scene makes no sense with the one the main  ""evil"" girls hanging out with her other trashy girlfriend and her white trash boy friend (where they like do this weird 3-sum reference)  I didn't see the point of it?!?!
The F/X effects mostly digital look pretty good  (some a lil off) But, can be forgiven
There are a few slow motion scenes that work so good! Plus seeing the High School up in flames while Carrie is walking away from the school is jarring!
My only problem with it is the ending with Carrie White's tombstone with spray paint over her name reading ""Carrie Burn in Hell""
which isn't realistic much like the original with the spray paint too  (Never understood why this was used Cause it takes you out of the movies
Everyone knows the story but, in this day and age with cyber bulling and all the insanity in America
The film is a social commentary on high school peer pressure, Conditioning, Abuse, Religion,  & cliques  along with much more
it's still digs deep in your head and haunts you in such a  primitive manor
you won't forget her name anytime soon....
There is a reason why there has been 4 Incarnations of this book  (It goes into very deep subject matter that all of us as a society need to talk about)
see it support this film 9/10",1382659200,,2248,4.314285714285714
5377745,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Let's just start by fending off the critics who just troll for things to criticize.  This is a remake of the 1976 film based on Stephen King's first novel.  Because the original was powerful an remains effective to this day, some may argue that this is a remake that has no business being made.  I thought that about the 2011 remake (which they claimed was a prequel) The Thing (2011).  However, unlike The Thing, Carrie was remade impressively, honors the original and brings all of the quality to a present day audience that may have never given the time of day to the 36 year old original.

Carrie White (Chlo Grace Moretz; Dark Shadows, Let Me In, The Eye, The Amityville Horror) is an awkward, sheltered, God-fearing 18-year old living with her fanatical zealot of a mother (Julianne Moore; Seventh Son, 6 Souls).  She develops telekinetic powers after being humiliated at school as she comes of age (physiologically).  As a result of her humiliating trauma, she becomes the subject of attention of some clique-y, over-entitled ""it"" girls leading to a cruel prank that gets way out of hand when after Carrie is asked to prom by a popular boy, they are crowned king and queen of the prom, and Carrie has the time of her life.

The changes from the original were few in this remake.  But the major accomplishment here was modernizing a classic while preserving legendary acting performances with current actors.  Everyone seemed to do a solid job.  Carrie's classmates were vicious, with a cruelty credibly fueled by entitlement.  Chlo Grace Moretz was impressive, instantly capturing my greatest sympathies.  And Julianne Moore made me shutter almost every time I saw her face; hauntingly insane, often psychotic.  Moore commands most of our nervous attention until the prom scene, when Chlo Grace Moretz shifts gears from great to amazing!

At this point I'd like to pause and address a non-horror victory.  The prom scene was enchanting.  They did such a great job making Carrie's date seem sweet and attentive.  For about ten minutes we see Carrie coming of age mentally as a beautiful, somewhat confident woman.  She makes friends, has her first dance, enjoys her first embrace from a boy, and feels safe and cared for perhaps for the first time in her life.  I almost wanted the movie to have a happy ending.  No, they really did that good of a job making this scene, welljust sotouching!  It reminded me of my prom and simultaneously made me think ""if I should ever have a daughter I hope she has a prom experience like this.""

Well, not entirely like this. This effectively sweet and tender scene primes us for what we all know happens next.  The messy prom finale.  It's impressive.  Carrie exacts her rage on her classmates to gory ends, sparing the few she knows to be innocent but indiscriminately rending all others.  Her face mixes horror, revenge and, at moments, a karmically reciprocal satisfaction.  The scale is large, the revenge is sweet, and the ending is appropriately sad.  Although, the final few minutes felt forced.

If I had a criticism it would be that Carrie's telekinesis comes out of nowhere.  It may have justifiably emerged after a traumatic event, but how did this not happen before in her four years of high school or a lifetime with her incredibly psychologically abusive mother?  She also seems to master the power to levels of shocking acuity, which diminishes the frightening rage-like abandon with which she wields her powers in the prom scene.  It seems equal parts meltdown and calculated, instead of entirely meltdown.

But largely this film was AMAZING.  This remake is not only worthy, but a must-see which should stoke young horror fans' interest in the original.",1382572800,7,3713,4.85828025477707
5377746,4,B00A2H9WW8,"Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie is unsettling, disturbing and still sympathetic in many was and always thought provoking. This version of this tale is dark and thought provoking. It is a very different version than that told by Brian De Palma. The cinematography and editing do this film well. Director Kimberly Peirce seems to have concentrated on the person and not the mayhem that can be unleashed. I felt this was closer thematically to Stephen King's novel in many ways. With the today's ability to touch people across the globe at almost any time of day with almost any message, be it unkind or bullying and downright hurtful in nature, this film seems very current. It also is so thought provoking from the biblical perspective. When is too much of anything enough?",1382572800,2,769,4.833333333333333
5377747,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Honestly, when I first began to read the casting information on Carrie I was ecstatic to read the casting of Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie and Mrs. White respectively. When the first few trailers came out I was honestly wondering if they were going to retell the actually Stephen King story and less of a remake of the original. After viewing the film, having read the books several times, I can say that I truly feel that this version of the film is fantastic to be able to stand on it's own.

Not only are the actors in the film playing their perspective roles with gusto, but the film finds a satisfactory balance with the original 1976 film and the Stephen King ""Horror"" novel. Now I'll be the first to admit that the movie itself is basically beyond being able to be filmed exactly as presented as it was in the novel (Multiple perspectives, News paper articles, portions of victim testimonies). I found that even in this and the original film, that they both found a way to ""enhance"" the Prom Scene itself. In the novel the Prom is basically done from the outside with Carrie sealing the doors and a fire breaking out. In this particular version they even go so far as to give Carrie a true motivation to begin to reap her revenge on the poor high school students.

I was particularly pleased with Chloe's portrayal of Carrie White. It was easy to sympathize with her from her upbringing, to the constant torment that she received at school. When she was happy I felt it and when she was broken and belittled I completely understood. It's hard not to watch this film and compared it to Sissy Spacek's portrayal of the character. Carrie in my mind was always quiet and reserved and deeply saddened and I felt that overall Sissy's portrayal was more of a offsetting and slightly more spooky of the two, but I felt that of the two Chloe carried a more humanizing element to Carrie herself.

This brings me to my review of Julianne Moore's portrayal of Miss White. I was so satisfied with her quiet performance. I felt the love that she had for Carrie underlying in every line that she spoke. It was not overplayed and satirical like in the original. I loved that fact that they even went so far as to add in the self harm that she frequently caused herself in the novel. What was more impressive was how dark it was to watch this woman who so obviously loved Carrie deeply could quickly drop into religious zealot like behavior and cause harm to her daughter as much as she could to herself.

That aside, I was mostly pleased with the supporting cast, Judy Greer above all else. I could see the need for these characters to be more age appropriate than the original, but Ms. Desjardin stood out above all the rest. It was easy to see Judy Greer truly channeling her motherly instincts to defend Carrie at any turn that she could and that made it easier to see that Chloe's Carrie cared and appreciated her as well.

The special effects were just that, it is a truly quickened sequence and mostly a build up in the film. The telepathy this version is far more CGI oriented and that is not a bad thing in all honest. It made the Prom that much more original from the first and it certainly made me feel that the telekinesis that Carrie displays to be far more fantastical, just as it is in the novel. It takes a while to push the films R rating, but in the end it fulfills just what SK set out for in the original novel and that is a deeply disturbing and horrifyingly beautiful character study. This version of the film and the original are on par with each other and certainly timeless in story related matters. The difference is stark and strong in both and I'd honestly recommend both for any collector. The true beauty in this remake/re imagining is director Kimberly Pierce took a story as deep as Carrie's defined it, not as a horror story, but a tragedy. I truly feel that is for the best.",1382400000,4,3916,4.4484679665738165
5377748,3,B00A2H9WW8,"This version of Carrie is a modern take on the 1976 version, based on Stephen King's first novel. It adds a few new elements and the cast is quite good, but it is another remake that does not need to exist. We all know what is going to happen and it is nearly a copy in structure. Chloe Grace Moretz has the acting ability to almost make me forget that she is too pretty for the role. The prom scene lacked the impact of the original, but overall it was still enjoyable and better than most of the new takes on classic horror films. Worth at least one look.",1382313600,8,557,4.1192660550458715
5377749,5,B00A2H9WW8,"When I left the theatre, the rest of the day all I thought about was this movie. Before any hardcore fan's of the original jump and call me stupid, realize that I love the original and I'm actually open minded to giving re-makes a try.

Chloe Grace Moretz portrays her so well, that I actually felt so sorry for her and the brutal bullying she encountered by her peers. I was actually in awe when the ending came because I didn't want to see her die. Julianne Moore, wow.. she played Carrie's mother so well. The entire movie she came off as a over the top religious woman that was so enclosed by her religion that it was actually scary. This movie is not a 'jump and scream' type horror movie by no means. It's more of an emotional horror where you feel extremely sorry for Carrie and scared by the actions of her mother, peers and how she deals with it all in the end. Note: Creepy is an un-fitting word for Carrie's mother, Margaret White, whom is far worse than creepy. Psychotic? Definitely. The suspense or action doesn't take long to get too, which I loved. Why did I give it five stars, you ask? I gave it five stars because this movie DID indeed need a remake, well for me it did at least, and they hit the nail on the head with this one. I absolutely love it, and have watched it at least five times since it's release. Not everyone always likes watching a movie made in the 70's. I do love the original but I have to say that this one came pretty close in my opinion. Of course you have all the cult classic fan-boy's that will say no Carrie is as good as Sissy Spacek, which might be true but that's only because that's the first version they seen of Carrie and fell in love with that one. People need to realize that re-makes will be forever be made and just because the original cast isn't in it DOES NOT mean that it's automatically a horrible move. This movie is far from horrible. If you've seen Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass as Hit Girl, please know that her performance in this one steers a complete 180 away from how she was in that movie.

In conclusion, I'm an open minded person and I love giving new things a try. My review is that this movie is just as good as the original one with Sissy Spacek as Carrie. I say that because the 2013 version with Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie is far more in depth (story wise) than the original and the ending is much, much, much more heart pounding and more true to the book. All I can really say is I'm writing this review because I actually came on here to pre-order this movie on blu-ray (that's how good it was for me).",1382313600,16,2584,4.228744939271255
5377750,2,B00A2H9WW8,"Theatrical Review.  There may be spoilers.

Director, Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Don't Cry"") is a friend of Brian DePalma, the director of the original 1976 thriller, so I'm sure he provided the proper encouragement to update this excellent Stephen King story.  And yes, the film is updated with picture-taking cell phones, music, cars and clothing.  Unfortunately the film is also pretty boring.  Chloe Grace Moretz (""Kick-Ass"") is certainly more age-appropriate to the character of Carrie than the 20-something Sissy Spacek in the original.  This Carrie, while still withdrawn and insecure, is also a little quicker to ""come-out"" in terms of her kinetic powers.

With a bone chilling opening scene, Margaret White (excellent Julianne Moore) is in the process of birthing baby Carrie and comes fractionally close to plunging a pair of scissors into the baby's skull thinking she is the offspring of the Devil himself.  Clearly mentally unstable, Margaret's motherly instincts override her original impulses.  But as Carrie grows, she is sheltered from the real world and is forced to spend time in a prayer closet for such improprieties as suffering the onset of menses.

Carrie is the brunt of brutal bullying at school, which is led by Chris (Portia Doubleday).  When Chris refuses to repent, she is expelled and can't go to the prom.  Her revenge is centered back on poor Carrie who gets to go to the prom with Tommy (Ansel Elgort).  He's the boyfriend of Sue (Gabriella Wilde) who does feel guilty and is trying to make amends.  So if you're familiar with the story you know what comes next and I was admittedly anxious for it to start.  But even updated with new CGI special effects, I wasn't transfixed like I was with the '76 version.  In that film, the first thing that happens is all the doors to the high school shut down tight, keeping everyone enclosed in a big room where Carrie can do her damage.  Here, people are escaping (or not) through various exit opportunities.

I will admit that Moore's portrayal of the deranged momma Margaret is very convincing and very good.  Moretz is fine, but everyone else is just eh.  This isn't a horrible remake, but it is certainly unnecessary.",1382313600,5,2192,4.920980926430517
5377751,3,B00A2H9WW8,"I am an obsessive CARRIE fan...the book, the original movie, the musicals, the TV movie version - I've seen them all, several times.  To me, the story is timeless and resonant, and for adolescents in particular, the story of CARRIE packs a powerful punch. Several things surprised me about Kimberly Pierce's ""reimagining"" of CARRIE as a contemporary horror film - firstly, it is in many ways a shot by shot remake of the superior DePalma film; secondly, where it DOES deviate from DePalma's film, it fails (in some cases embarrassingly so) by comparison; and thirdly, the lead of this CARRIE is ALL WRONG.  Chloe is far too self-aware and bold as a young woman to ever convey the tragically sad Carrie White.  For me, the impressive pyrotechnics and CGI that fill the last hour might have actually been worth the re-tread had we been as engaged with the character as we were with the spookily perfect Sissy Spacek.  But alas, despite a good, updated supporting cast - chief among them Judy Greer as a winning, funny gym teacher, and Portia Doubleday as a Chris Jargensen you viscerally hate - this CARRIE is more full of sound and fury, but signifying far less than DePalma's still-heart pounding original.",1382313600,2,1206,4.811594202898551
5377752,3,B00A2H9WW8,"Steven King's first published novel was ""Carrie"" in 1974 and then two-years later in 1976, the film came. ""Carrie"" starred a relative newcomer at the age of 27 named Sissy Spacek. Spacek brought the character to life and had one of the most iconic film scenes of all time. That one scene caused young girls for ages to always look over their heads at the prom.

The new version of ""Carrie"" stars Chloe Grace Moretz, who is not a newcomer, has been part of almost 30 films to date and is only 16. Moretz is a perfect casting choice for a film that was trying to emulate the original. She is the right age for an awkward high school girl with no friends and she even somewhat looks like a young Sissy Spacek. Moretz, who has been acting since she was 8, proves that she is a fine actress, effortlessly moving from shy teenage recluse to shy teenage recluse with a glimmer of hope, but at times her postures are extremely annoying and over-exaggerated; a tilted head here and a twisted shoulder there; product of pre-effect acting.

Both movies, 1976 & 2013, delve into the life of a girl who is held prisoner by a religious fanatic mother and therefore has no social abilities. Although where her social abilities are virtually non-existent, she finds that she has unlimited ability of telekinesis. This is the nuts and bolts of both movies, but the problem is, the stuff in between is also pretty much the same in both movies.

The new version didn't explore any new venues. After viewing the new version, I can only guess that they just wanted to retell the story to a culture of people who are more acutely aware of school bullying and spruce up the special effects when they come about. The movie plays like an old-style film experience, not overtly focusing on special effects and events and giving us a rich amount of personality, which I like, but if you're gonna make the exact same movie, you sure better make it better than the original. It wasn't.

""Carrie"" 2013 isn't a bad film and I'm sure for those who haven't seen the original film it may even be a good film. From somebody who has seen the original though, it was a waste of time and effort. To make matters worse, the effects that were done in 1976 may have been from the 20th century and before HD, pixels and green screen effects, but at least the effects looked real. The effects in the new version did nothing to approve upon the original and most of the time, you can tell that Moretz is acting before the layers of effects are placed. Not to mention, many of the effects went over the top and left us with the impression that Carrie was more X-Men than high school girl with strong telekinesis.",1382313600,,2667,4.481481481481482
5377753,3,B00A2H9WW8,"I suspect those of you who haven't seen the original 1976 movie version of Carrie will like this movie more than those who have. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Carrie, a young girl who has led a sheltered life. Her religious fanatic mother hasn't even told her about her periods. After gym glass, when she has her first period ever while taking a shower, the other girls make fun of her and toss tampons at her. When the ringleader of this chaos, played by Portia Doubleday, is banned from her prom, she vows to make Carrie pay. She doesnt know that Carrie has telekinetic powers which will intensify after her first period.

Moretz is good but Sissy Spacek in the original was great. You believed that she really could be an extremely shy girl who just doesnt fit in with her contemporaries. Julianne More is good but Piper Laurie in the original was great. You believed she really was a religious fanatic. Doubleday is not as convincing a villainess as Nancy Allen was in the original. And John Travolta as her airhead boyfriend in the original seemed more like a real person than Alex Russell.

The actors might have done better if they had been given a better script. Unlike the 1976 movie, the 2013 script favors special effects over character development. Moretzs character has the power to tear up highways. In the 1976 movie, special effects were kept to a merciful minimum.

Carrie is based on Stephen Kings first novel. According to King, the movie (1976 version) made him what he is today, one of the bestselling authors in the world. I think the movie (1976 version) was better than the novel, although I know some King fans who disagree with me. One person who does agree with me is Stephen King himself who, in Danse Macabre, described his book as having a certain heaviness a really good popular novel should not have. He further states that his book lacks the style of the 1976 film. I don't think he would be that impressed with the 2013 version.",1382313600,,1957,4.617816091954023

5377765,1,B00A2H9WW8,"I vehemently hate remakes of great movie classics.
The exceptions have been John Carpenter's approach to THE THING, another was INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and two others: THE RING and THE BLOB.
The original 1976 CARRIE became a landmark in movie making. We had phenomenal performers--Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie (both nominated for Academy Awards), a knockout supporting cast, fantastic direction from Brian DePalma, a powerful music score,screenplay, editing, etc.
In this version I saw this afternoon, the whole movie looks like it was filmed through an unwashed window. The colors were flat, almost pastel. Chole Grace Moretz portrayed the misfit Carrie White as a beautiful young girl who wears her hair matted over her left eye. In no way, does she look like a pitiful, abused girl, only one who just needs to brush her hair and raise her face.
Julianne Moore as Margaret White, the mother, is ugly, skeletal, who mumbles so low it was impossible to understand her most of the time. Piper Laurie portrayed her as a voluptuous woman with a magnificent mane of red hair that resembled a halo.
We never see much of Carrie's newly discovered powers. She makes things rise up and down, doors slam, and at the end, she does suddenly unleash her fury. But she has no interesting enemies to payback for their bullying.
I missed the powerful music score of the original, and looked for something different.
This rendering was so bloodless and anemic, it could play on the Disney Channel with little editing.
And yes, this version copies the original scenes down to that final ending where ""Sue"" dreams of taking flowers to Carrie's grave.
This grade-Z remake reminds me again of the total drought of fresh ideas in Hollywood.
For the $30 million it took to make this bomb, the money could have been invested in a brand new horror classic--the kind we saw when brilliant minds gave us such classics as PSYCHO, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, ALIEN, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD, HALLOWEEN and of course CARRIE.
Surely, these filmmakers are out there, dying for a chance to give movie-goers something fresh, new, original. Yet, I hear we may be getting yet ANOTHER remake of a classic: CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. And the filmmaker: none other than junk meister, Rob Zombie who gave us those ghastly junk remakes of HALLOWEEN.",1382227200,9,2354,4.8875
5377766,5,B00A2H9WW8,"This movie was well done.  Julianne Moore did a very good job portraying the mother, and Chloe Grace Moretz is a good actress.  I was pleased with this.  Chloe Moretz did excellent playing Carrie White, and her feelings toward her classmates was brought up well in the film, too.  The beginning was different in comparison to the original Carrie, and the ending was good.  Overall, I'd recommend this.  I'd see it again.",1382227200,,420,4.763888888888889
5377767,5,B00A2H9WW8,"When it comes to the plot, I'll just give a brief summary, pretty much everyone knows what it's about. Carrie is bullied by some of the most popular girls in school, and they push Carrie too far, then Carrie uses her newly found telekinesis powers to dispense good ole fashion justice.  With all of this going on, Carrie has an overbearing religious mother.  That's all I really want to say about the plot.

The casting is amazing.  Let's start off with Chloe Moretz. Chloe knocks the role of Carrie out of the park.  She does such a nice job with the role. Chloe adds such an emotional element to Carrie.  The shower scene was so emotional, my heart broke for her. She was the victim, and she didn't deserve what the girls did to her.  Chloe played it perfectly.  When it came for Carrie to get revenge on her bullies, you can't help but to cheer for her. Chloe is such an amazing actress.  Moore played Carrie's mom, and she did such a nice job. When he was on screen, my heart was actually pounding with uneasiness, it was such a good performance.  As for the bullies of Carrie, we don't like them, and we were meant not to, the bullies played such a good part. When they got what they deserved, you didn't feel sorry for them.

I can't say enough good things about this movie. If you've seen the original, and liked it, go see this one. You'll love it. Personally, I liked this more than the original.  If you see it, you won't be sorry, I know I wasn't.  Chloe is simply amazing.

When it comes out on blu ray, I know I'll be the first one to get it.",1382227200,2,1555,4.262798634812286
5377768,3,B00A2H9WW8,"For 38 years the original Carrie has remained one of the greatest horror movies ever made, a shining example of not only how to adapt a book into a movie, but also how to make you....Fear, so it was inevitable that a remake would be made.
 To not compare this film to the original is impossible. Brian De Palma's version is an immersive experience, a psychological assault on the mind, you feel what Carrie White feels. Chloe Grace Moretz is an incredible actress, but her Carrie doesn't quite project her fears and emotions into us like Sissy Spacek's did.
  In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie, the mother(played by Julianne Moore) nearly lacks the controlling dominance the original had over Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz's Carrie right from the start doesn't hardly fear her mother, but instead shes defiant towards her, hates her, and this is what separates this new Carrie from the original. Brian De Palma's Carrie FEARS and Kimberly Peirce's Carrie HATES.
 For the most part the majority of the middle of this film plays out almost identically to that of De Palma's, the actors are the only real difference. Some of the new actors are good and some are just terrible, like Judy Greer(Miss Desjardin / the P.E. teacher), she sounds so week and juvenile when shes speaking her lines it's hard to take her seriously as an authority figure.
 Lets fast forward to the prom scene. In Brian De Palma's Carrie after winning prom queen and king Carrie and Tommy Ross head up to the stage, this scene is gloriously shot in slow motion, eventually the blood gets poured on her and she goes into a state of absolute shock, the only sound that can be heard is the bucket swaying back and forth, then the bucket falls and hits Tommy in the head knocking him unconscious, in her state She takes no notice of whats happened to Tommy as the overwhelming fear that has enveloped her causes her to lose control unleashing her powers on all her school mates. In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie...well lets face it, the prom scene lacks the build up of the original, no slow motion, no sounds of a swaying bucket, how this scene was shot by De Palma is what made the original so fantastic. Kimberly Peirce's Carrie somewhat figures out how to control her powers, unlike De Palma's who's powers mainly activated out of fear. This time when the blood is poured on her head she doesn't go into shock, instead she nearly walks off stage before turning around after Tommy is hit by the bucket. This pushes her emotions over the edge and in a fully aware state of mind she unleashes her powers on her class mates.
 I personally feel nothing for Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie, it may have followed the plot of the book a little closer in some areas, but it did it with far less sophistication. It has some unique changes that make it worth a watch, but ultimately it doesn't come close to the brilliance of the original.",1382140800,44,2888,4.630859375
5377769,5,B00A2H9WW8,"Remake or re-imagining? I'd almost whole heartedly say re-imagining. Though at times you can still feel the essence of the 1976 film, it still feels new and revamped. However, this adaptation stays relatively close to the source material while staying modern at the same time. I understand homage - it's fine and all but it feels to be consistent at times. Yes, De Palma's film is classic but it shouldn't be the back bone of this film which at times it feels like it is. The homage's in this film I believe is kind of a mistake. Sometimes there is a little bit of a rinse and repeat cycle in this film as if this would be an actual remake. But those little complaints do not mean anything to the other great things in this film.

  The acting is pretty superb. Julianne Moore nails it as Margaret White. She really understands and captures the psychology of Margaret. Chlo Grace Moretz... She's outstanding as Carrie. I definitely see an Oscar nomination in her future. Most likely not for this film but any character she portrays like this in the future. I think her performance is just as good maybe even better than Sissy Spacek's. Ansel Elgort as Tommy Ross is great and he really captures the high school jock role and looks like he walked straight out of an Abercrombie and Fitch magazine. Gabriella Wilde gives a strong performance as Sue Snell and she is really believable. Portia Doubleday is so good it seems she is Chris Hargensen, she's completely different from the good girl in Youth in Revolt. Alex Russell is definitely the breakout star here and I wish there was more of his bad boy Billy Nolan role.

  The CGI is really great and it's a breath of fresh air to finally the prom not in split screen! The effects are really good and made me trip up at times. What really works about this film is that it's directed by a woman. Kimberly Peirce understands the story and makes this film really engaging. However, I wish this followed the format of the book or at least something like the book. The set photos and the teaser looked as if Carrie destroyed the town, wish I wished she did in this. Instead I think the reason this films release got pushed was because MGM and Screen Gems wanted this to be as close as possible to the 1976 version. Which kind of upset me. But anyway, great film, great acting, great visuals. Overall a really fun time and this film is graphic! A couple of times I squirmed a little and had to bite my nails! I'd give this film a solid 9.5/10. Really great film, give it a chance.",1382140800,8,2523,4.462039045553145
5377770,1,B00A2H9WW8,"Since I am such a huge fan of the original ""Carrie,"" I went into this movie with tempered expectations.  Boy, was that a good move.  The latest remake was a HUGE disappointment.  I almost left before the ending, but decided I'd already been tortured for over 90 minutes, so I'd just buck up and try and stomach the rest.  I am amazed by the other reviews; however, after this movie has been in circulation a little while, I don't believe anyone will find it still being rated as a 4-1/2 star movie.

""Carrie"" tells the tale of a young girl with special powers, i.e. telekenisis (the power to move objects by force of the mind).  Constantly tortured by an over-protective, uber-religious mother--not to mention just about an entire high school--Carrie dreads just about every day of her life...until she discovers her power.  After that, Carrie feels a little more focus in her life; she has something no other teenager in her school possesses, and she doesn't feel so helpless anymore.  After a very ugly scene is posted on the internet involving Carrie and her ""becoming a woman,"" one girl feels the need to try and help Carrie fit in.  This turns out to be the worst thing for everyone involved.

Most of you know the rest of the story.  Scenes in the original that were poignant, tender, and so meaningful have been replaced with hurried attempts to tell a story--and LOTS of CGI.  Although Chloe Grace Moretz does a decent job as the title character, it is the rest of her cast that do this movie in.  Julieanne Moore was an absolute train wreck as her mother.  Her character portrayal was lifeless.  I'll take Piper Laurie's over-the-top portrayal anytime over the zombie-like mumblings of Moore.  I could compare (character for character) the 1976 version to this remake, and there was not ONE actor who came close to hitting the marks of the original.

""Carrie"" will hopefully die a quick death.  This should be a lesson to all the morons in Hollywood who continue to think they are capable of outdoing a classic.  It will never work, so STOP already.  ""Carrie"" is rated R for violence and language, and was directed by Kimberly Pierce.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",1382140800,23,2161,4.709333333333333
5377771,4,B00A2H9WW8,"In 1974,  Stephen King released a tale of a troubled girl with the ability to move things with her mind. In 1976, that story became a horror film that went to become a classic. In 1999, a sequel was made and it was soon forgotten. Now, in 2013, a horror remake has hit theaters, and that film is simply called Carrie.

Directed by Kimberly Pierce along with producer Kevin Misher and screenwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the team wanted to bring a refined adaption of Stephen King's novel to the silver screen. To give the movie even more credit, acclaimed actresses Chloe Grace Mortez and Julianne Moore were added to the film. With good stars and keeping true to the story, what could possibly go wrong for Carrie? Well, nothing to be honest.

If you know the story of Carrie, then you should know that the remake's plot follows the Novel, as well as the 1976 film, to the letter. When it comes to the plot point,  it seems the only differences in this remake are the locations.  That being said, I think what helps the remake's story are additional scenes. Having moments like Carrie testing her powers make all the difference. I think what makes this film's story good is its pacing and willingness to tell the story of Carrie and everyone around her.

I'm mixed about the character of Carrie. Sissy Spacek certainly made a name for herself when she played the character in 1976; and no shock in why. Spacek played a troubled girl who was just aching to fit in. However, the same applies to Chloe Grace Mortez. She played the role to the best of her abilities; making her portrayal easy to understand and fully dimensional. As you can see, it is hard for me to decide who is better; but while the two performances are at a stalemate, it is the supporting cast that makes all the difference. While I can't say I was impressed with the performances of the high-school characters,  most of them seem to have a reason for their intentions oppose to just being cliches. The only character I can take a points away from is Gabrielle Wilde's Sue. While both version of the character try to do the right the thing, it seemed that the new version of Sue was little too preachy.

Then there is Julianne Moore as Carrie's mother, Margret. I have to say, Julianne Moore shows her talent in this role. The character of Margret White is far more frightening then her 1976 incarnation. The reason for this is subtlety. Julianne's performance was not as over the top as Piper Laiure; which made her that more frightening.

I think the big question that this film is trying to answer is whether or not Carrie can be contemporary or is it dated? While certain themes could have been stronger, I think the filmmakers did a great job bringing the story of Carrie to year o 2013. Yet, as I said, I think what would  have  sold a different approach for the film would have been theme of bullying. While it is touched upon, I'm not sure the movie hit the mark at grasping the idea bullying and how it is reflected in today's society. While it was a good attempt, the theme could have been stronger.

When we think of Carrie, no doubt we think of the story's major scene where Carrie gets soaked in pig's blood and all hell breaks loose.  When I saw the remake today, I thought this was the weaker scene oppose to the 1976 film. However, after seeing the original again, I have had a second opinion. While the scene might not as much practical effects, it was excited to see. There was nothing in the sequence that was distracting and it made easier to enjoy the rage of Carrie.

I know many will not agree, but I have to say: The Carrie Remake is the best film to have the name Carrie to it. Sure there are issues, but the movies strengths comes in its execution. This remakes resurrect Stephen King's story for a new generation; and Carrie has never looked better.
