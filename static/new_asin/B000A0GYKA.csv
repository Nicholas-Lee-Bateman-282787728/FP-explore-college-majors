2346917,4,B000A0GYKA,"Extremely educational. After watching it is difficult to understand how the decendants of these missionaries (or any), can sleep at night. Unasnwered in the video are the obvious questions of why the U.S. government hasn't apologized, and shouldn't the families of these missionaries who own the stolen Hawaiian land be forced to donate it to the public or to those with a certain percentage of Hawiian blood? Despite these questions, the video is moving, educational and extremely depressing. Sort of leaves you feeling so not proud to be an American, and even more ashamed of the Christian missionaries who stole the Hawaiian land and took occupation and finally imprisoned an old, peaceful woman to steal her power. The only mystery really is how that missionary grandson featured in the video can actually defend the actions of his ancestors and still look into the camera. Or for that matter, how he actually sleeps at night. it leaves you repulsed.",1190246400,9,954,5.044303797468355
2346918,5,B000A0GYKA,"I learned a lot from this DVD. I did not know why the other Hawaiians were so angry because my mother grew up the English way.  As I watched, something in me understood the anger of being betrayed.  All I can say is that I am ashamed of the American Government for not giving back what they do not own.",1147996800,11,302,4.016666666666667
8071518,5,B000A0GYKA,"I like the narratives, especially the ones done by the locals.  Sad but true story about American imperialism and the effects of christianity on such an innocent and accepting group of people.
Anyone who watches this should visit the refurbished Iolani Palace, where the Queen was held prisoner.",1518480000,,295,5.145833333333333
8071519,5,B000A0GYKA,"This is a well done documentary on the history of Hawaii and Queen Liliuokalani, who would be the native Hawaiians' last Queen.  The interviews are well done and the story well presented, however, there is no way around it, the story is a very sad and injust one.  For a group of New England Congregationalist missionaries arrived in Hawaii and their descendants promptly became the well-to-do sugar plantation owners who plotted the overthrow and imprisonment of Queen Liliuokalani.  These Missionary Boys figured out how to misuse the ideals of democracy and constitutional government to suit their own enterprising ventures.  And due to the nobleness of Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii became annexed to the United States without any Hawaiian blood being shed. This annexation was done solely for the purpose of benefitting the greedy and heartless sugar plantation owners who were the grandchildren of the original ""missionaries.""  An accomplished lady herself, Queen Liliuokalani composed what has become the world's most well known Hawaiian song, ""Aloha Oe.""",1411430400,,1059,5.432926829268292
8071520,5,B000A0GYKA,"I know the general history form other readings. However this was a well put together presentation of How to pilfer a country.

I will not go through the details as that is why you are purchasing this documentary. It puts the world of the time in prospective. And of course focuses on Hawaii's Last Queen.

8071522,5,B000A0GYKA,"This is a ""Makana"" (gift) for Hawaiians...presents our Liliuokalani as a compassionate queen fighting with dignity till the end
yet ever mindful of not sacrificing lives of our peaceful defenseless people.  A must for any Hawaiiana collection.",1361923200,2,243,5.5675675675675675
8071523,4,B000A0GYKA,"Straightforward, well-told and sad, this documents how U.S. business interests, and then the government slowly took
Hawaii away from the Hawaiians. It's a tale too little known and discussed.

Queen Lili'uokalani comes off as quite an impressive and even heroic figure, trying to keep alive her culture and protect her people,
without resorting to violence. Whether that was the right approach is debatable. One historian in the film argues that if the Hawaiians
had put up some sort of armed resistance before the U.S. was too ensconced it might have backed down. But I'm not sure. Once it was
clear there was wealth to be had, given the expansionist and racist tendencies of the era, the Queen may well have been right and just
avoided a wholesale slaughter, or the kind of active genocide the Native Americans of the mainland had faced. I'm not sure popular U.S.
opinion would have sided with these brown-skinned 'others', even if violence had drawn more attention to the situation. Nor that the
Hawaiians had anywhere near the arms or numbers of people to win such a war.

It's the tale of a monarch spending much of her life facing a series of lose-lose propositions in the face of 'progress' and imperialism, and
desperately trying to do the best she could with dignity and grace. A piece of history too easily forgotten. Well worth seeing.",1355616000,,1346,4.8478260869565215
8071524,5,B000A0GYKA,"It makes me cry...My Grandparents were born under the Rule of the Hawaiian Royal Family. It saddens me that most people don't even know we had a Royal Family, let alone that we have a culture and language.",1353715200,,205,4.421052631578948
8071525,5,B000A0GYKA,"When missionaries landed in Hawaii, they had the bible, and the natives had the land.  Subsequently, they had the land and the natives had the bible.
This DVD recounts the decimation of (1) the Hawaiian royalty and (2) a population of 800,000 to what is left today.",1294099200,,265,4.638297872340425
8071526,5,B000A0GYKA,"I used this DVD in conjunction with Liliuokalani's autobiography and other texts when I taught a class called Hawaiian Women; Myth and Legend.
It was very even handed in its treatment of the historical events precipitating the ending of Hawaii's Monarchy.",1268352000,4,255,5.2439024390243905
