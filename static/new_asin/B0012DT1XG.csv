8245315,3,B0012DT1XG,So I gave it 3 stars b/c the first 2 stars said I hate it or I don't like it... It is old but nice to see the animals. 1.. the information is very out dated and 2 the first alligator they find and follow... well they show 2 different alligators.. I've had to push pause and I may come back to it. But for now this is what I have to say.,1497484800,,336,3.6164383561643834

8245317,2,B0012DT1XG,"First, I should say the soundtrack is the real gem here! Second is that this movie is not about alligators. The first part is about a guy in a headband, kind of looking for alligators with the narrator leading us on, like big time. You will kind of learn about exploring underwater caves, a little about bats, and see some cool turtles. I wanted to turn this off, I really did, but the music kept pulling me back in. In addition, they poke an alligator with a stick once or twice (side note: I'm not really sure that the footage came from them or if it is stock). Later we learn a bit about matinees which was cool but I kept waiting for the gators. Also, the documentary was so old that if I was a space alien or trapped in a bat cave, I wouldn't know if matinees had gone extinct or not which felt bad because it turns out matinees are really nice and kind of look like space aliens. Which brings me to another point, maybe the film makers are very knowledgeable about alligators but we would never know because they don't tell us much.  For example, about half way through, there is a point in the documentary where the narrator tells the audience about the difference between crocodile and alligator behaviors but then changes the subject completely. At that point I was devastated but I kept watching because of the music which sounds like the opening music for Twin Peaks.",1457308800,,1378,4.425196850393701
8245318,5,B0012DT1XG,Very interesting,1425254400,,16,7.5
8245319,2,B0012DT1XG,"The first twenty minutes mentioned alligators maybe once or twice. The rest of the information wasn't very scientific, more like a general overview of what you'd find in the Everglades. A little dull for me.",1418688000,,207,4.942857142857143
8245320,2,B0012DT1XG,"For a ""documentary"" about alligator supposedly released in 2007, there is no recent data and the video is obviously from back in the 1970s to 1980s.  It also doesn't cover much about the alligator.  It's more about the Everglades as a whole, and very superficial at that.",1408579200,,271,4.74468085106383
8245321,2,B0012DT1XG,"It was ok. It looks like it was not current, as if it may have been filmed 30 years ago.",1403827200,,88,3.45
8245322,5,B0012DT1XG,Gave it to my 5 yr. old grandson who into alligators.  The gift was a hit.  He loves watching it.,1388016000,,97,3.8
8245323,3,B0012DT1XG,"Very relaxing travel movie that is much more on life in the Everglades than on the alligator.  Nice photography and interesting underwater scenes.  I think I would put a disclaimer that going diving with alligators is one of those ""do not try this at home"" scenes.",1382572800,,264,4.717391304347826
