4863483,4,B005S9EINI,"This movie is one that has been missing from the herd for a long time, but one with a story that needs to be told. A good movie about the coming out experience and, surprise... No one is murdered in the end! My only complaint is that it's a bit on the short side and the actors look a bit too old to be playing 17. Other than that I think it's a worth the time to see.",1330041600,5,368,3.730769230769231

'Pariah' is the feature length expansion of a short film created by Dee Rees, presented at the Sundance Festival in 2007. It's basically a coming of age story focusing on a middle-class, black Lesbian teenager, Alike, played by Adepero Oduye. The title 'Pariah', is a bit of a strong epithet to describe Alike's situation, as she's mainly an outcast in the eyes of her mother Audrey (Kim Wayans), a devout Christian, who can't stomach the idea that her daughter is not really interested in men.

'Pariah' is uniformly well-acted with a slow-moving plot that holds few surprises. In fact, take away the black middle-class environment and you'd be left with pretty much your ordinary 'coming out' tale of a conflicted gay teenager. All the stock characters are there including the 'villain' of the piece, the aforementioned intolerant mother as well as the more sympathetic police detective father, Arthur, who's not crazy about his daughter's choice of sexual orientation  but still holds a special place in his heart for 'daddy's girl'. Also in the mix is Alike's best friend, Laura, who enjoys hanging out at 'rough' Lesbian clubs but eventually decides to get her GED. While Alike still enjoys a bond with one parent, Laura is not on speaking terms with her mother, who shows no interest when Laura rings her doorbell and informs her that she's passed her GED.

Eventually, Alike's Mom introduces her to Bina, the daughter of one of her colleagues at work (strikingly played by Aasha Davis). The Mom finds Bina much more acceptable since she comes from a more upper class environment than what she regards as the lower class world Laura comes from. Bina invites Alike over to her house and makes it clear that she's interested in having an intimate encounter. At first Alike admits the proposition makes her uncomfortable but on a 'second date', the proposed tryst is consummated. The twist is that Bina is merely bi-curious and Alike is sorely disappointed that she won't be having an extended relationship with her for the foreseeable future. Alike's reaction is predictable: a full-scale meltdown where she trashes her own room.

'Pariah' concludes also on a predictable note. Alike's Mom again chastises her for disappearing and then the parents argue over the mother's suspicion that the father has been having an affair. Alike declares her independence when she reveals to her father that she's been accepted into a creative writing program and asks his permission to sign papers so she can leave home.

I suspect that deep down, 'Pariah' has garnered so many accolades not because it's a great film, but precisely because critics wish to encourage the film's creator, Ms. Rees, who apparently has much more talent as a director than a screenwriter. In terms of the writing, perhaps Ms. Rees' strongest suit is dialogue, which has a realistic, gritty feel to it. I also liked her choice of alternative rock for the soundtrack, instead of loud, rap music, which is the type of music one would expect to find in a drama of this kind.

'Pariah' is a well-crafted first feature effort. You'll find very good acting here and a story that will pretty much hold your interest to the end. Nonetheless, I didn't find myself invested enough in the protagonist's journey to end up raving about the film as so many others have done. By film's end, with Alike's decision to branch off on her own, my reaction was, ""okay, that's nice!"" In essence, the filmmaker is saying that those who have been ostracized in society need to go forward in spite of all the criticism. But most young people must go through obstacles in order to achieve independence. Were Alike's difficulties in 'coming of age', that much different than other teenagers? Not really. Hence, I didn't feel I was watching something so 'different' or 'out of the ordinary'. It's up to Ms. Rees to next take on a project that goes beyond the world that she knows so well about and is comfortable with.",1328313600,9,4000,4.873529411764705

A trusted friend who betrays her feelings and her other friends who struggle themselves.

Wow!  What a hidden gem among all the lez-themed films out there.  The casting/acting is superb, the story is very realistic, and you don't have to be a particular race to relate to this one.  I'm not a teenaged black girl, but plenty of the characters from this film are familiar and were part of my own coming out story as a full-fledged lesbian (the bisexuals, conservative parents, obnoxious sister, awesome best pal, etc).  I'm not surprised a number of reviewers said they watched it for a class or that it's honest and well-developed enough to promote a good deal of discussion.

Alike (pronounced A-lee-kay) is a 17 yr old middle class black lesbian living in Brooklyn and struggling with both her sexuality and the expectations of her overly conservative parents.  Her mother (Kim Wayans) is traditional, religious, and very controlling.  She doesn't approve of her daughter's tomboy nature or her masculine best friend Laura (a stud), so she's doing her best to ensure her daughter doesn't morph into a man.  She buys her feminine clothes she's forced to wear and sets her up with a ""normal"" friend she's forced to spend time with.  Alike's father (Charles Parnell) isn't much more helpful.  He's a stern looking cop with a conservative exterior... but mostly absent on a number of levels and preoccupied with his philandering deeds.

As a result, Alike (Adepero Oduye) has a few secrets.  She changes her clothes on the way to school into her preferred dyke-wear.  She explores the local girl club with her bud Laura (Pernell Walker).  And she admires girls from afar. She's also an in-betweener... not the stud her best friend is, though she kind of emulates her... and she'll never be the femme her mom wants her to be.  Finding your way through this spectrum is always an interesting journey to me, lol.  Alike is also an aspiring writer/poet and spends a lot of time writing down her perceptions on life... which are far more limited at the start of the film as she is a closet case virgin who is afraid to act or act up.

Once Alike takes that first step in exploring other women... things get more intense at home.  But she learns.  She learns some hard lessons... about women, about family, about best friends.  I appreciated this honesty, and I'm sure this helped her to grow as an artist, but it also made the story more than a little angsty and sad.  Even though the conclusion leaves us at the threshold of her adulthood with plenty of implied hope... I really wanted a better ending for Alike.  Don't get me wrong... there are some definite highs in the movie... it's not all angst.  But, well, I just wanted to see Alike matched beyond the elusive bisexual and the flakey bi-curious... and to find an emotionally available woman who will give her the love she deserves.

Yeah... I like my happy HAPPY endings, what can I say.

Well worth watching... but a sharp taste of real life here.  A full cast of likable talent here... don't know why I'm not seeing them in more mainstream movies.

There is kissing and implied sex here. And no lesbians die in the end...  :)",1423008000,2,3100,4.667896678966789

4863995,4,B005S9EINI,"Alike (Adepero Oduye), is a Brooklyn teenager on the cusp of coming out to her parents (Kim Wayans and Charles Parnell). Alike's parents however, see her best friend Laura (Pernell Walker), already an out lesbian as a bad influence. When Alike finally does come out, her proclamation elicits an especially negative reaction from her deeply religious mother.

While Alike's father tries to be supportive, he only sees her interest in women as a phase. As Alike explores her own identity and sexuality, she searches for a balance between her conservative parents and the community she is embracing. Despite hostility from her own mother, Alike bravely navigates the joy and pitfalls of life in an effort to find her true self.

Written and directed by Dee Rees, Pariah deftly illustrated the pain of growing up different in a family and society that has very specific expectations. Pariah is an expansion of Dee Rees 2007 short film of the same name.

Young actress Adepero Oduye is wonderful as Alike; she brings an honesty and sincerity to the role, which is outstanding. Oduye somehow manages to portray hopefulness in spite of the challenges she encounters.

For the plot/story - everyone over the age of 14 (due to sexual content) should watch this movie, b/c of the otherness of it. Most kids, I'm sure, don't know the lives that are portrayed in this story, but they should know them, and accept them. The fear of ways of life that are different from children's own lives that is often encouraged will be taken away by seeing this movie, b/c it is so raw and human - taking away the otherness. For children who are more exposed to this story in their own lives, I imagine this will give them a different perspective.

The one thing I didn't like was Kim Wayans' character.  I thought Kim Wayans the actress was on her AAA game and I believe she is a criminally underused talent in Hollywood.  But her character has to be one of the most unlovable, nonredeeming characters in modern cinema!  No wonder her husband feels so free to be a bastard with her!  I thought there was this one moment where she would soften and I'd see what motivated her, what made her tick.  Nuh-uh!  She remained a total enigma to me until the very end.

I am amazed at Dee Rees' Indie effort, and the brilliant central character played by Adepero Oduye. Intelligence abounds, from the direction, acting, script and the incredibly personal cinematography.

I'd heard of the film from its many awards and finally checked it out. The very personal and insecure issues a young gay person faces are difficult to explain, often to one's self; Ms Oduye handles this complex dilemma with care, concern and precision. I was never in doubt of her sincerity.

Her best friend, Laure (Pernell Walker) is excellent, as a tuff bull-dyke wannabe, with a heart of gold. The confused parents, ably performed by Kim Wayans and, especially, Charles Parnell, hit strong nerves. Indeed, the entire cast is flawless, and the crisp close-up photography belies its Indie status.

My only argument is that it involves middle-class black folks. The story of a black Lesbian, a la ""Precious"", would be interesting. That might be a story that needs to be told. (Kim Wayans' mom is less mean but as indifferent.)

Regardless, it's a fine film achievement. Dee Rees is a talent to be reckoned with, as well as all involved. Kudos to all involved.",1345766400,,1243,4.794392523364486

4864100,3,B005S9EINI,"One of the values movies bring to the masses is the ability to learn new things, new places and well...new cultures.  This coming-of-age film from newcomer Dee Rees tells the story of an African-American 17 year old anxious to express her sexual identity.  She comes from a strict religious home and Alike's (terrific Adepero Oduye) homosexuality hasn't been addressed with her parents (Kim Wayans and Charles Parrnell).

Alike's best friend Laura (Pernell Walker), is ""out"" and tries to hook her up to lose the ""V"" standing.  Alike wants a relationship first and believes she may have found it with Bina (Aasha Davis) who she met through an associate of her mother's.  Bina is experimenting with her sexuality and when she plants a kiss on Alike, Alike bolts.  When looking at the story from a distance, it is something that has been played out many times in the past.  What makes it provocative is that we are talking about black teen-age girls, who like other black teen-age girls.  The performances are excellent, especially Ms. Oduye.  I would also mention, the film has a rockin' soundtrack with several selections by a band called Tamar-Kali who is also the lead singer.  Yes, a rock band.

The 1080p Blu ray has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is excellent with nothing to complain about.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is excellent as well.

Adepero Oduye, an actress I never heard of until this film, challenges her character well in this heartfelt role.  Kim Wayans, someone who most of us grew up laughing at thanks to 'In Living Color' also plays the overprotective mother of Alike and also deals with a struggling marriage.

4864137,5,B005S9EINI,"There has been much reductive talk about how PARIAH is PRECIOUS 2011.  While they both deal with a protagonist trying to break free of her stifling family situation, PARIAH is much more gentle in tone and tells the tale of a young, tomboy lesbian navigating her way through life.  Adepero Oduye has such charm as Alike, a smart high school student who doesn't quite know what to do with herself yet.  Kim Wayans, who has excelled in comedy in the past, is striking and vivid as her less-than-supportive mother, while Charles Parnell is charming and wonderful as her father.  Pernell Walker plays a character you don't get to see often in film, the butch lesbian friend, while Aasha Davis has the impossible role of a friend who turns into a love interest, and then has a strange, out-of-left-field turn.  She charms despite the odd transition.

I found myself caring very much for this cast of characters, mainly because of the refreshingly articulate way they expressed themselves.  It's a breath of fresh air to see a so-called ""urban"" (hate that term) drama where the people in it seem to care about music, books, and each other.",1335916800,3,1132,4.774358974358974

The cinematography (Bradford Young) was amazing, haunting....I am a genuine fan of Ms. Adepero Oduye and kudos to Ms. Wayans for taking this serious role. Pernell Walker was effective, yet understated in her role; the handsome, ultra-competent Charles Parnell was a revelation and left me wondering: ""Why haven't I seen this magnetic dude in other films?""

4864139,5,B005S9EINI,"Writer/Director Dee Rees is an inordinately talented newcomer. If PARIAH is indicative of the quality of films she will create, then we are in for a new level of verismo cinema. She tackles a tough subject - same sex relationships among African American women - with such insight and care to details that her film jumps off the screen screaming as in the words of her heroine `I'm not running - I'm choosing': lesbian girls are not God's mistake (to quote the mother figure) but instead have the courage to accept their difference and embrace their sexuality and still become successful members of society.

Alike/Lee (Adepero Oduye, a fine young actress who hails from Brooklyn by way of Nigeria, a graduate of Cornell University who has studied acting with Wynn Handman, Austin Pendleton, and Susan Batson) is a 17-year old sexually conflicted girl who lives in Brooklyn with her younger very bright sister Sharonda (Sahra Mellesse) and her parents - police detective father Arthur (Charles Parnell) and conservative, overprotective, biased mother Audrey (Kim Wayans). Alike is an excellent student, a blossoming poet, and a lesbian: she maintains tow life styles complete with clothes changes so that she can be the `daughter' at home and herself outside the home. Alike's best friend Laure (Pernell Walker) is her support system as Laure is comfortable about being out as a lesbian. Alike's home life is strained as her ever arguing parents disagree on many factors, on of them being Alike's need to appear like a man. Audrey arranges for Alike to become friends with Bina (Aasha Davis) who is the daughter of one of Audrey's friends, an encouragement that eventually leads to Alike's surprise first sexual experience with a girl who is just `doing her own thing' - ie, not a lesbian. This deeply affects Alike, she delves more deeply into her poetry and graduates early because of her shining school record. At a point of no return she is confronted by her parents and the manner in which she makes her decision as to `run or choose' provides the ending of the story.

The cast is uniformly strong and though Adepero Oduye makes a show-stopping debut, the other actors are equally superb. Bradford Young is the cinematographer who helps create the atmosphere. The dialogue is delivered in street language and is often covered with shouting and with multiple characters talking simultaneously: subtitles help here. But the genius of the film is in the concept and the courage and in the amazing gift for creating meaning cinema that comes across as the work of Dee Rees.  She is a talent to watch.

At home she tries to be the woman her mother and father want her to be. Away from home she tries to be herself. Leading the double life is starting to wear ""Li"" down and she uses her writing to help release the emotions out that she holds. To be honest I wasn't really looking forward to this one. The preview made the movie look OK but I was still expecting it to be a little boring. I was dead wrong. Almost from the beginning you feel a connection with ""Li"" and throughout the movie that only grows. The acting is excellent in this and Kim Wayans (yes, that Kim Wayans) give a performance that is almost better the Mo'Nique's in ""Precious"". This movie is comparable to that one in a lot of ways. I will say that this movie is easier to watch and in my opinion better the ""Precious"". Very moving and real. One of the bigger surprises I have had watching a movie lately.

4864141,4,B005S9EINI,"""Pariah"" (90 min.) brings the story of Alike (played by Adepero Oduye), a 17 yr. old girl living with her younger sister and her mom and dad. Alike is discovering that she likes girls better than guys. Alike's mom picks up on the fact that Alike is going through a ""tomboy"" phase, and is urging dad to do something about it. Dad, however, has his own problems (the movie shows a short phone call that one might interpret he has another lady in his world) and besides (as he says) ""Alike is always daddy's girl"". Needless to say, a lot of tension builds up between mom and dad and Alike. To reveal more from the plot would spoil the pleasure of watching this movie, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.

A lot has been made of the fact that this is a movie about a ""black teenage girl coming out"". I guess I really don't see at all what the relevance is, if any, of the race or color in this movie. What I saw was an intense family drame, set in contemporary Brooklyn, New York. It's not even so much a ""lesbian"" movie. I came away impressed by the fact that this is writer-director Dee Rees' debute film, as the movie certainly doesn't feel like the work of a novice.

There are a number of acting performances worth noting, none more so of course than Adepero Oduye in the role of Alike, but also Kim Wayans as Alike's mom and Charles Parnell as Alike's dad. Last but not least, there was plenty of great music featured in the movie (unfortunately the credits went by so quickly I barely had time to register all the music that was featured, although I did notice that Reema Major has 5 or so songs credited). In all, I thought that ""Pariah"" was well worth it, and I would readily recommend this if you are looking for something good to watch outside the Hollywood commercial mainstream.",1331424000,24,1797,4.345238095238095
4864142,5,B005S9EINI,"Pariah is a powerful first film by an emerging director, Dee Reese, well acted by a wonderful ensemble of actors, and beautifully and evocatively shot by Director of Photography Bradfford Young. Certainly the story is one that is not widely present within contemporary cinematic culture, but the film stands on its own as a powerful  piece of work, not merely a sociological footnote. The true brilliance of this movie is the way in which the visual experience wraps itself around the film's narrative. The camera work alone is truly groundbreaking and original, creating a consistently shallow sense of visual space that directs and redirects our attention in ways that allows us to experience the world intimately through the eyes of the young protagonist.

This is a film that should have received a wider screening than it did. That it was critically hailed was well deserved. That it is now available on DVD is truly cause for celebration. Buy this film, and keep your eyes and heart wide open while watching it.",1330992000,13,1017,4.941520467836257

Alike is scared, brave, poetic, and determined to live her life as she was born to live it. This is a lovely coming-of-age and coming-out film.",1529280000,,333,5.072727272727272

8484624,5,B005S9EINI,"A powerful, moving, beautifully directed, acted and photographed film of a teenager coming out.  If this were about anything but a black lesbian, it would be much more than an art house cult film and the cast would be on their way to stardom.",1510876800,,242,4.5

8484627,4,B005S9EINI,"Does a good job at addressing homophobia in the black community. Only 41% of black Americans supported gay marriage rights at the time they were passed. This should be a startling statistic seeing as most black Americans are Democrats. Almost all of the 8 countries that punish homosexuality with death are in the Middle East or Africa. It is a major concern for the LGBT because immigrants from these countries have been polled as wanting the same laws in the west, and their populations are quickly outpacing the few populations that show large support for the LGBT community and its rights.

This movie is kind of predictable and drags at times, but is worth watching, especially if you are of the LGBT persuasion. I saw it on Netflix which has a gay/lesbian section.",1490832000,,770,4.7894736842105265
8484628,5,B005S9EINI,"Powerful movie. Utilized for my gender studies course and students were very moved by the plot and the characters. Really reinforces the difficulties in coming out and challenges young people face; however, also has an uplifting ""It Gets Better"" kind of ending.",1490400000,,261,5.238095238095238
