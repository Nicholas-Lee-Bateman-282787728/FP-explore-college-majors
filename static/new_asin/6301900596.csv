375718,5,6301900596,"First, this movie is one of my favorites.  The film is solid the acting is great, and the music is beautiful.

Deborah Holland's ""You're Makin Me Crazy,"" is such a beautiful song.  I would love to see more films she scored.

Anyway, to the movie itself:  You gotta love it.  This is a fun, futuristic road movie.  Jim Metzler is great as he was in A Gun a Car and a Blonde.  Dana Wheeler Nicholson was also great; you really felt for her character, tough, attractive woman looking for something she will probably never find, but she won't give up.  Lu Leonard as Juice is outstanding.  Vernon Wells as Plughead really sets the mood of the film.  The characters all fit well in this film especially Denis Christopher's Leach.  But the show stealers are Paul Wilson and Andy Goldberg as Squaid and Beane.  Paul Wilson was also great in a movie called The Devonshire Terror with Donald Pleasants and Suzanne Love.  He had hair too.

This DVD Pak is great especially the commentary.

As for Circuitry Man II on the flip side, it is a good solid follow up to the original, and although Debra Sheldon is very sexy and tough and the love scene with her and Metzler was great (especially that song Walk Away), I really would have like to see Dana Wheeler Nicholson back.

Jim Metzler is a great actor and should really be seen in more films.  He is a great leading man.

There was talk about a Circuitry Man 3, anyone know about that?  I hope they make it.

Circuitry Man was plugging before the Matrix copied Dark City.  If they do make a 3rd installment, I hope they bring back Dana Wheeler Nicholson and definately let Deborah Holland Score the film.",1136160000,4,1645,4.468013468013468
375719,5,6301900596,As one of the first films in the genre of Cyberpunk I think it deserves a place on any sci-fi lovers shelf. It's full of unique fun ideas on a low budge. Dennis Cristopher is outstanding as well as Dana wheeler Nicholson. And the film makers did a good job of keeping the film moving and involving.,1035072000,,298,4.245614035087719
375720,4,6301900596,"Quirky, noteable little Sci-Fi fable about a post apocalyptic future  (again), wherein robots and technology have become the new currency (a la  William Gibson's Neuromancer via ""Johnny Mnemonic"") of the  tattered remnants of civilization. ""Circuitry"" ups the ante by  making the satisfying story focus on a ""Romeo"" model of android,  that is programmed (i.e. tricked) into doing whatever it takes to find the  great love of his life, who doesn't really exist. Smart, cool, and unique,  especially on such a restrictive budget.",967939200,3,527,5.353658536585366
375721,5,6301900596,"The story bears strong resemblence to CHERRY 2000 in which a man was in love with an android.  In CIRCUITRY MAN, it's the android in love with a computer program.  Both males hook up with a sexy female mercenary to find  their loves, across a post-apocalyptic desert, confronting questions of  what it means to be human.
CIRCUITRY MAN also features the beautiful Dana  Wheeler-Nicholson, and a sexy actress in the delightful role of Yoyo, a  bad-girl assassin.",936835200,2,460,4.909090909090909
375781,2,6301900596,"Public Appeal: If anyone working with Amazon is reading this, can you make ""Plughead Rewired: Circuitry Man II"" available on Amazon Instant Video? I'm already this far down the rabbit hole, I'd might as well see far it goes.

This movie is a mess. It's just a total mess. Either I missed something big time or this film is just so poorly edited that the plot is murkier than the Dead Sea. Oh, man, where do I begin?

The plot is about a future roughly forty years into the then future of 1990 where humanity has moved underground because the Earth's surface has become largely uninhabitable. A woman who was once apparently involved in organized crime gets roped back into helping her old boss with a strange sort of drug deal involving microchips as in this future it's implied that all it takes to get super wicked high is to have a series of complex surgeries that only a handful of people would know how to do installing SCSI ports in your head and then plugging circuitry chips into these ports and reacting with pre-programmed emotions. It sounds really cool, right?

Well, it sounds cool and this movie probably looked really good on paper but it doesn't translate well to film at all. The whys and hows of the workings of this world are left widely unexplained and the only thing that seems to be tangible is that this woman and her robot pal need to get to New York from LA by going ""Topside,"" that is, above the underground cities across the desert of the former United States to make some sort of deal that will make them Bill Gates rich. But the antagonist of the film, Plughead, played by Vernon Wells is in hot pursuit of them because apparently he wants the chips for his own personal gain-- or does he? By the end of the film his motive seems to pull a complete 360 without any explanation as to why whatsoever. Again, maybe I'm missing something.

Plughead is the only interesting character in the entire movie. He's like if Pinhead from the ""Hellraiser"" movies had a baby with a Borg from ""Star Trek."" The movie has this weird running theme that Plughead is addicted to sensation and as he puts it ""I HAVE... TO FEEL... THE PAIN!"" Which is what you probably said to yourself and your buddies on the drive back to your apartment if you went to see this film in theaters in 1990. However unlike Pinhead, Plughead doesn't seem to be completely amoral. Like Pinhead he shows signs of lust and wrath, but unlike the Lead Cenobite he has empathy for some characters, showing them his odd form of mercy or friendship. Every other character is so one dimensional it's embarrassing to watch because suddenly you find yourself looking at your watch and waiting for Plughead, the bad guy, to show up. It's kind of like ""The Dark Knight"" in that way, the only good scenes in the movie are the ones directly featuring the villain.

The special effects are decent for 1990, the acting, with the exception of Vernon Wells, is cringe-worthy and the soundtrack is surprisingly catchy yet seems a bit out of place. The film is edited in a very choppy manner. It seems like there are parts of the film that the writers/directors/producers just sort of expected us to 'get,' when it's more than obvious that entire scenes and subplots were sliced right from the film reel and left on the cutting room floor where they probably remain to this day. It's very hard to follow, poorly acted, but it's pretty to look at and it has a cool bad guy. It's like this weird hybrid of ""Mad Max"" and ""Blade Runner"" with splotches of ""Hellraiser"" thrown into a blender with quasi-noir themes and a soundtrack that while decent, simply doesn't belong in the movie.

I'm glad it's available on Amazon Instant Video and quite frankly I will absolutely buy the sequel ""Plughead Rewired: Circuitry Man II"" if it's made available, if for no other reason because I'm morbidly curious and the DVD for the sequel has been out of print for over a decade. ""Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War"" is easier to follow than this movie, and that's saying something.",1407110400,,4023,4.572815533980583

375786,4,6301900596,"This gem of a film has everything a sci-fi lover could be yearning for; comedy, a dark vision of the future, a robotic romance with a twist and a fleeting chance of redemption for mankind. Wired analysts who live off pain and lovesick Romeo Biobots populate this highly creative, fast paced film that somehow manages to overcome what must have been a low budget. Every scene has you smiling inwardly, eagerly awaiting the next... a real page turner, without the pages. The Lovy Brothers write some crisp dialogue that holds up well today, including some prophetic themes of climate change that include the death of all forests and oceans... not bad for a 1980's flick. In fact, the themes of manufactured love and hardwired addiction to pain warrant a remake of this already classic, post apocalyptic story.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Circuitry-Man-1-2/dp/B00005NB8T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Circuitry Man 1 & 2</a>",1303344000,,965,5.708333333333333

  Very NO or Low budget films but very watchable if you just forgive some of the glaring mistakes  (why would a android need to breath oxygen?).
  One possible answer to that question came from the movie ""Prometheus"" when the hero asks the synthetic person ""why do you need to put on a suit to go outside?"". His response ""I guess so you will feel more comfortable around me"".
  Just get out the popcorn and pop and enjoy this one.
