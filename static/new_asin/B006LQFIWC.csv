8500476,5,B006LQFIWC,"This movie takes a real look at what war photography is like. While a little gory (in some places), this movie is a reality check for those who do not think that war photography is a dangerous job. Parts of the movie where funny, and other parts were shocking. This is definitely a movie that one must watch at least once in their life.",1339632000,,336,4.265625
8500477,5,B006LQFIWC,What a brave and talented man my son is. This was shot over 15 years. The DVD contains deleted scenes from the original documentary. This was featured in the 2009 SXSW Conference. The sound is clear and full.,1335657600,2,208,4.5
8500478,5,B006LQFIWC,"I am a big photography buff, especially news photography, and I have known of Robert King's work for some time. I had not, however, known the story behind the man so to speak. This stunning documentary lifts the veil off the world of the combat photographer and what makes them tick. In this case the focus is Robert King, a man who comes across as totally likable but inevitably scarred and changed by his nearly two decade exposure to the hell of combat. I cannot recommend this more highly. A must see!",1333584000,,505,4.5
8500479,5,B006LQFIWC,"Robert King is such a likeable guy.  It is really interesting to watch him learn and grow and see how he reacts to such crazy experiences.  This film is truly inspirational to photographers, journalists and anyone who ever had a dream that seemed impossible.",1327017600,3,258,4.840909090909091
8500480,5,B006LQFIWC,"This movie is great. It not only opens up your eyes to the atrocities of war and really informs you on what some people are really capable of but it is also heartwarming and a sort of coming-of-age tale. You are able to see Robert mature and grow and learn how to love while still witnessing the awful things that go on in other places of world. I recommend this film to anyone, as it is a film that NEEDS to be seen,",1326844800,4,417,4.036144578313253
8500481,5,B006LQFIWC,"""Completely blown away by it. It's beautifully put together, and by far the best war doc I have seen ... It's beautifully constructed with the reveal of his wife and son at the end, and his development as a character works so well. I dread to think of the work and time that went into it but it is a brilliant film...""
Nick Broomfield, Film-maker.

""Stylishly filmed, laced through with humor, some horror, and the ever-present whiff of despair, Shooting Robert King makes for compulsive viewing. The life of Robert King is, in the end, an Everyman's life, lived out against some of the largest and most incomprehensible sadnesses of our time, and that, somehow, is also deeply entertaining.""
Jon Lee Anderson, New Yorker Magazine writer, Author.

""Darkly comic, as if ""Scoop"" was reimagined for the 21st century as a gonzo acid trip through some of the most hellish wars in memory, Shooting Robert King is also a moving story of love and redemption... I've never seen a better film about journalism and war.""
Peter Bergen, Chief CNN Terrorist Analyst, Author.",1325635200,3,1060,4.850828729281768
