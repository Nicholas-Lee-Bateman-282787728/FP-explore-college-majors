1972088,5,B00015HX18,"Very remarkable series of movies based  on those close to Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Thomas. Of course some of it is subjective because we were not there but based on what we do know I believe it's accurate.",1320796800,,201,4.4324324324324325
1972089,5,B00015HX18,"These movies are fiction, but with biblical truths portraying Jesus's awesome character and real human emotions that we can all relate to.  Well make visually and engaging stories.  I enjoyed all 4 movies and actually watched them backwards starting with the 4th dvd.  If you are looking for biblical accuracy, this is not it, but if you are looking to understand the character of God and how he relates to us humans, then you found a great series!",1302393600,,448,4.717948717948718
1972090,3,B00015HX18,"While the actors were professional and the man who played Jesus was good, I'd recommend ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""Visual Bible: Matthew"" over this product any day.",1285027200,2,162,5.037037037037037
1972091,5,B00015HX18,"I purchased the video, Close to Jesus, for myself and it was outstanding.  I purchased one for my brother and he never received the DVD.  Where is it?! What happened?!  This is a first from Amazon.  I have ordered from Amazon for many, many years and I have always received my order(s).  What happened?  Please send the video to my brother.  Thank you.

1972092,5,B00015HX18,"I had viewed & taped off air, the program on Mary Magdelene, with commercials.  I didn't even know there were more programs in, what I guess is best called a ""mini-series"".  The title characters in this series are barely given notice in scripture.  With Mary Magdelene, her identity has become s much legand, that we really don't know her.  She has been a mixture of various unnamed women in the Gospels - the woman whoentered a house where Jesus was having supper & washed her feet with her tears & dried them with her hair, the woman posessed by demons, thewoman caught in adultry. Could Mary Magdelene have really been all of these women ""rolled into one""?  Yes, it's possible, but unlikely.  In this series, she is portrayed as a wife, whose womb was barren.  Her husband divorced her for this, plus, he had fallen in love with another woman.  She enters a life with a Roman officer, and then becomes a servant of Herodian, the second wife of Herod.  Then, she meets Jesus & becomes one of his followers.

Joseph of Nazareth, is of course, Jesus' earthly father, who with Mary raised Jesus.  In scripture, he isn't even quoted as saying even one word.  We know he betrothed Mary.  Mary rceived the annoncement that she was going to give birth to the Messiah.  She traveled and visied a relative, Elizabeth & stayed with her until after Elizabeth's baby was born.  When she returned to Nazareth, she was definately pregnant.  Joseph knew he was not the father of the baby in her womb.  He was going to divorce her, until an angel spoke to him.  Then, he took Mary & brought her to his home.  She was ready to give birth & they went to Bethlehem to register for the census.  She gave birth there.  The magi visited Herod to ask where the King of the Jews was.  Herod didn't know, but his scribe told him the new King of the Jews would be born in Bethlehem.  The magi find the child & present their gifts.  They don't return to Herod.  Herod orders all babies of two years or younger be slaughteres.  In this program, Herod is portrayed as being really vicious.  Scripture dowsn't tell us when Joseph died.  This program shows him dying shortly after he, Mary & Jesus return to Nazareth from a visit to Jerusalem for one Passover.  Scripture is silent after that trip.  We are told, at one point, that Jesus' mother, brothers & sisters are looking for him.  Joseph is not mentioned.  We think he had died at some point before.  Since scripture is silent on Joseph, this entire program is conjecture, but very nteresting.

Judas is forever known as the man who ""handed-over"" Jesus to the Jewish Temple priests, for thirty pieces of silver.  Why did Judas need this money?  This program explains that a friend's father had been imprisioned & was scheduled for crucifixion in a few days.  The daughter felt she could buy her father's release by bribing one of the Roman guards.  In this program Judas is portrayed as coming from a rich family in Jerusalem, who renounced his affluence to follow Jesus.  Jerusalem is ""bulging"" with all the pilgrims who have come to the city for Passover.  Pontius Pilate is trying to do everything to keep the people in Jersalem ""in line"".  Turns out, the man supposedly in prison isn't in prison at all.  Pilate's guards capture Jesus in Gethsemene & Jeus is tried, flogged, crucified.  Barnabas is released as a Passover pardon.  Judas commits suicide when he realizes what he has done.

Thomas is remembered as the man who doubted that Jesus had been risen from the dead.  He sees Jesus being carried to the tomb that Joseph of Armithea had volunteered.  This entire show addresses the time period of just before the Last Supper to Jesus appearing twice to his apostles.  Thomas is on a quest to find what happened to Jesus' body.  He even crosses a desert to findthe Roman who crucified Jesus, because he is in a community of crazy people.  In this program, a bit more supposed story of who Joseph of Armitheas is.  It's possible his story is at least partially true.  Thomas returns to the apostles after Jesus has appeared to them & doesn't believe they actually saw th ""master"".  Jesus appears to them & summons Thomas to come & touch his wounds.  he does & the apostles are shown leaving Jerusalem after the Passover celebrations.

Each episode is about 90 minutes.  They don't need to be viewed in any sequence - each episode is an individual program.  It was definately worth the time & money!",1275436800,12,4434,4.591315453384419
1972093,4,B00015HX18,"I only watched the first episode on the 4 disc--Mary Magdalene. I know that I am re-studying the bible and as I was watching thie movie, it made logical sense why Mary slept with many men...when Jesus initially was there when she was about to be stoned for her adultery and later at the well, said you are married to 5 husbands (meaning intimate contact with men)...but this movie did not illustrate or show that and surprisingly showed her with the anointed oil, kissing his feet and washing it with her tears and wiping it with her hair...thought this was another woman with no name in the Bible...however it was well-written and brought tears to my eyes since women are mistreated and sometimes viewed as a prize or piece of meat as they explained in the movie (a man's possession and not to ever love them)....I enjoyed the acting (astounding and superb) and want to buy it and watch the other versions from the Public Library!",1143763200,11,931,4.614457831325301
1972094,2,B00015HX18,"The assertion that Jesus Christ never existed is beyond ridiculous.  Whether you accept Him as your savior or not, his existence is thoroughly documented in many sources, including from those who were hostile to him and would have preferred he didn't exist -  the Romans and the Jews.  We have many reliable ancient Roman and Jewish texts from the time period of Jesus that corroborate his life and the message of the Gospels.

Only the most rabid, fanatical atheists deny the existence of Jesus.  For factual information corroborating the existence of Jesus, I recommend ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel.",1135296000,12,609,4.99009900990099

1972155,4,B00015HX18,"I would buy this DVD as a gift to help heal anyone who has experienced abuse, betrayal, adoption parenting and deception experiences. This is a jewel DVD to give because I was seeking to learn about Judas having watched the DVD on Barabas life. I was surprised there were four DVD's in the case that includes Mary of Magdala, Joseph, Judas and Thomas. This was a treat to watch and enjoy as the order for Slightly Bad Girls in the Bible Series DVD is a lecture type which narrates Sarah and other women who mistreated others in the Bible. I returned the Bad Girls series because this DVD had the movie version and best describes the sorrow and challenges of Mary of Magdala, Joseph father of Jesus, Thomas as well as Judas. My package arrived with a defective smashed DVD case that could hold the 4 DvD's. If this happens to you the seller cannot send you a Quad DVD case you can buy one for out of your own expense here at amazon. Type clear quad DVD. Otherwise the seller cannot replace and control the manner of shipping and exchanging a case even with best efforts because the cost of the product is less than the value of the brand new case. Otherwise this is a keeper and must have in a Bible DVD collectors wish list. I recommend to anyone I hope you get your case un smashed! Now you know why I had to pay extra for a new case because this DVD is a treasure to keep and share. No Deceptions it's that good to keep.",1390608000,3,1422,4.270370370370371

1972158,4,B00015HX18,"Nowhere in the Scriptures does it say that Mary Magdaleme was a
prostitute, reformed or otherwise. She was simply one of many
women whose lives were turned around by Jesus and his teachings
Women were there for him when the men ran away. Magdalene was at
the foot of the cross when He died, at his burial, at his tomb to
see him alive again, and at his ascension.
It is believed she became a contemplative and retired to an abbey
in the south of France.",1374192000,,453,4.27906976744186
1972159,5,B00015HX18,"This is a very sweet and compelling view of Our Lord and Savior made by wonderful Italian TV creators. I especially like how Jesus and the good Disciples are portrayed by handsome (actually, kind of hot) Italian-looking actors, while Judas looks like an ugly, big-nosed Jew. Or maybe an Arab. As a born-again Christian and active member of the Tea Party, that is the kind of historical accuracy I look for in my TV shows. When I die and they open the Pearly Gates for me, I look forward to being surrounding by beautiful, holy Italians (and maybe some pretty blonds), not ugly, big-nosed Semites. (As for the Afro people, bless their souls, I suspect they have a kind of basement paradise, where the servants live.) Praise Jesus and always vote 101 per cent Tea Party!",1373846400,3,768,4.654411764705882
1972160,5,B00015HX18,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this and was surprised i would like it so much as it is NOT bible history, each vignette is a creative exploration and expansion (based on what is known Biblically) of 4 real life characters in the life of Jesus. The writing is creative and same time credible, reflecting what the Bible implies (as much of it is a creative reconstruction of these lives).  It is a high quality project, sets, costumes, etc...But especially high is the quality of the acting. Some of these actors are not household names but give such polished perfomances one wonders why we don't see them more. I speak especially of the actors who played St Joseph: Tobias Moretti, and the actor who played Thomas: Ricky Tognazzi. Powerful, totally unself-conscious performances. Very inspiring. I was disappointed in the actor who played Christ; of recent movies the most powerful performance of Jesus has been Henry Ian Cusick in Gospel of John, and Diogo Morgado in The Bible, and of course, the forever incomparable Jim Caviezel.",1370044800,3,1027,4.936416184971098

1972163,4,B00015HX18,"I have seen a lot of videos about the life of Jesus.  Close to Jesus is the best I have seen for helping the viewer understand the relationships Jesus probably had with 4 for his followers.  The quality is excellent and the acting is believable.

Another would be a DVD titled Who Was Jesus. That is an excellent DVD for helping the viewer understand how people lived during the Jesus' time.  It also deals with the politics of the time.

My third pick would be a DVD titled Visual Bible: Matthew.  That video seemed to focus more on scripture from the book of Matthew.  It is the story of Jesus as told by Matthew.  Recreation of the sermon on the mount is very good.",1358208000,14,668,4.330645161290323
