8265956,5,B0017HFLHM,I've enjoyed Max Raabe's other DVD's also.  This one was very good and I received it quickly. Thank you.,1487980800,,104,4.473684210526316
8265957,5,B0017HFLHM,Max Raabe is a unique and extraordinary entertainer and this DVD is one of his best ones. The girls are beautiful!,1385683200,,114,4.476190476190476
8265958,5,B0017HFLHM,"The music Max Raabe and the Palast Orchester have chosen to preserve is captivating and leaves one wanting more and more.  It brings back the time of Ballrooms and when fine night clubs served dinners and had a dance floor.  Vocalists stood or sat waiting for the orchestra to play up to the part where the vocalist walked to the microphone and sang the refrain to the music playing.  But Max Raabe takes us to the Weimar era which was the German version of the time.  People were not doing well and needed to escape to places where they felt safe, they could have food or drinks and perhaps dance.  Everything was non-political and the music was pure of purpose except to make you laugh or reminisce with the one you loved.

There are a number of excellent Max Raabe DVD's available but the ones marked REVUE are exceptional.  The big beautiful women who dance in unison are at the same time naive and innocent as well as sexy.  They are handsome women if not beautiful.  The costumes are less than lavish compared to today's styles but it also indicates a feeling that things might be changing and if a good time was to be had, it had to happen immediately.

The Orchester men and one woman are wonderful.  They play astonishingly well and zoom in and out of each others trills without a spill.  They seem to be having the best time of all; teasing and laughing at or with one another.  I have seen them in a live concert and their spirit never lags.  Max Raabe never cracks a smile but astonishingly denotes a warmth and friendliness which cannot be described in words but must be seen to understand.  But the music is never compromised.

To illustrate the Max Raabe and the Palast Orchester spirit I submit that they appeared in Tokyo where the venue was completely sold out.  After the concert finished, all the musicians marched to the lobby where a great many of disappointed ticketless people waited.  Max Raabe and the Orchester gave a special concert for the people who waited patiently.  I seriously doubt anyone would regret seeing and hearing this group.  In the meantime buy the DVD Album.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palast-Revue/dp/B0000TEUNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palast Revue</a>",1372464000,2,2249,4.8994708994708995
8265959,1,B0017HFLHM,"I guess I should have known to investigate that the DVD I ordered in GOOD FAITH from Amazon would not have a requirement for a DVD Decoder installed.
The DVD is USELESS to me.",1358121600,,175,4.176470588235294
8265960,4,B0017HFLHM,"For those who appreciate the music of the early 20th century, this Max Raabe DVD is a wonderful opportunity to spend 2 hours of viewing and listening enjoyment. Be advised that the documentation which is on the DVD (no hard copy came with my disc) is in German as is Mr. Raabe's running commentary. There is a running explanation of the program on the DVD but it is also in German. I do not read German, therefore although the audience appreciated his commentary, I did not understand any of it. The choice of selections is representative of the era. Participation of the musicians and the choreography of them and the dancers are professional and well-produced. Subtitles in English would have added considerable to appreciation of the effort. This would not play on my DVD player that had the ability to play the most common DVD formats. I was able to play it on my MacBook Pro.",1342310400,2,880,4.647435897435898
8265961,5,B0017HFLHM,"It was my lucky day when I discovered that this DVD9 format, though it would not play on my DVD player, would play on my computer's DVD player (and by the way, that is also true for Region 2 formatting, so i was able to also enjoy the Rome Concert of the Palast Orchester) Both are great, but ""Palast Revue"" is absolutely the best two hours of entertainment ..... ever ... anywhere! As a native NYer I have not been lacking exposure to good entertainment, but this is simply spectacular! What an unbelievably talented group. Just about every member plays more than one instrument (several many more) and all sing beautifully as well. The charismatic Max Raabe is delightful and always a pleasure to hear.
  An old song I learned in the 1940s, ""Would You Like to Swing on a Star,"" as sung by three of the orchester members: Michael Enders and Thomas Huder, both trumpet players, and Jorn Ranke, trombonist is, in itself worth the price of the whole DVD. I never heard a sweeter rendition. I wish this would have played on my DVD player, so I could see it on a larger screen. However, it is worth watching on any size screen. I find it hard, as I watch, to see the whole show because I keep rewinding to repeat songs. Just terrific feel-good music,and there are a total of 37 tunes in this amazing show.",1299628800,10,1301,4.439330543933054
8265962,5,B0017HFLHM,"The DVD is great; however, I ordered two of them (each from separate vendors) and they were both defective.  Wish I knew how to obtain a good copy - one that did not make skipping noises every minute or so throughout the entire DVD.  Has anyone else experienced a problem with this particular DVD?

I really want to own this DVD and since I liked it so much, I just might have to order a 3rd one and keep it -flaws and all.

8265963,3,B0017HFLHM,"Okay before I get blasted like Joey, I have sent feedback to the seller about the lack of information in the description given. Nowhere in the seller's description does it state what region(s) the DVD is for. I received one for region 9 which even Amazon could not identify. If they had simply put region information in the description it would have saved me the headache of having to return the DVD. I have been told that the DVD may work on some off-brand players, however it cannot be returned if opened, and I cannot review a DVD I cannot play so back it goes to the seller.  Yes, the store name is Import-CDs however given the international market on Amazon a US DVD could be an import depending on the seller's location.",1295913600,6,726,4.458646616541353
8265964,1,B0017HFLHM,What can I say.  Having ordered this dvd twice from the same company and having to return it twice because the company did not check the region code playable only in China I have given up trying to obtain a Region Code 1 on this disc.  Does anyone know where you can get The Palast Review Max Raabe?,1280016000,2,299,4.137931034482759
8265965,5,B0017HFLHM,"This is fun. Real music, real entertainment from the time talent was needed to perform.
The music arrangements, the performing acts, the costumes, the decorsetting : it all is so carefully composed. As result I booked a trip to Germany to see Max Raabe live in Bonn. This is a must for those who have enough of the cheep, empty,talentless commercial popindustry of today.",1269475200,7,371,4.8125
