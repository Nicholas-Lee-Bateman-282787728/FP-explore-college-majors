It has upclose  looks at all the band members and a big proformance on their drum kit and a  really great story from the lead singer Peter Furler.  I rate this video a  100000 I love it so much!!",968284800,,255,3.9019607843137254
1054324,5,6305485550,"For anyone who likes the Newsboys, or even just wants to check them out, this is a great video! They are energetic performers, and the collection of songs is awesome! I definately recommend this video!",961372800,,201,4.771428571428571
1054325,5,6305485550,"One word: WOW!  I've been a Newsboys fan for a while, but have never had the chance to see them live.  This video blew me away.  Newsboys put on a show like no other I've seen before.  From the cinematography, the rotating  drum kit, the huge video screen which adds visual support to their music  and words.  They have successfully recreated the excitement of a live  concert atmosphere.  Plus Peter Furlers words at the end touched my heart.  For any Christian music fan, Newboys fan, or music fan, this video is  AWESOME!",946425600,12,524,4.586956521739131
1054381,5,6305485550,"Yes the editing is terrible, but I love it anyway. and if the bad editing might throw you, do not buy it. But for the price I paid it was worth it, being Newsboys. Great show, Great DVD. Great fun. Great message and heart for truth. Luv it. Only heaven will tell the hearts turned to God through Peter's preaching. The Gospel at the end is the best. Praise God all the way.",1245369600,3,373,4.123287671232877
1054382,5,6305485550,"This is a terrific live DVD by one of the all time great bands (not just in Christian rock).

I think this is misnamed.  Although called, 'Shine:  The Hits Live', this was actually filmed on the 'Step Up To The Microphone' tour.  Nevertheless, it is superb.

I have had the good fortune to see the Newsboys in concert three times.  They are always great and this one is no exception.  Some of the top hits that they play here include 'I'm Not Ashamed', 'Entertaining Angels', 'Shine', and many more.  There is also a terrific drum duet.

If you are not already a fan of Newsboys, you don't know what you are missing and should definitely get this.  If you are already a fan, you will love this.  Highly recommended!",1234310400,3,715,4.465116279069767
1054383,5,6305485550,"Newsboys has great music and I really like the drummer.

One of my favorite songs are; Breakfast, Take Me to your leader, Shine

1054384,2,6305485550,"I'm sure the music and concert are/were great but this DVD is so poorly edited that it's almost unwatchable.

The standard edit is 3 seconds -- that's the MINIMUM about of time it takes for the eye and brain to register an image. I counted edits here at one second and two seconds--it's impossible to focus on the concert because you see the guitar player for a second, then you cut to the audience and then to the singer and so on.

The music videos are okay -- poor transfer from video to DVD leaves them with runny colors. The best of the bunch is probably ""Take Me To Your Leader"" because it's visually memorable.",1139443200,6,617,4.356521739130435
1054385,5,6305485550,"Its the best DVD ever! The concert is nice and long. Really great if you like contemporary christian music. The concept videos aren't the best, but the concert makes up for them!",1059004800,4,178,4.59375
1054386,4,6305485550,"You can imagine the aw of a drummer when both of them (I forgot their names) are on this rotating platform that's tilted 45 degrees toward the audience and they are playing like it was the day before the rapture!  Anyway, I have to say the movie is awsome, but it's sad that they are the only christian group that I have found yet to have a DVD.  Other groups are, why aren't christian ones?  Anyway, they would have gotten 5 stars, but the Christian Music scene brought it down one because they need to get their act togehter.",996105600,2,527,4.303030303030303
1054387,5,6305485550,"This is a very good example of the Newsboys live show.  I love it so much and if you are wondering who the Newsboys are you should see this.  I love every song and Peter Furler really touches your heart at the end.  For anybody- fan or not Christian or not- you should get this amazing video.  I give it 1,000,000 stars.=0)(0=",989625600,,326,4.209677419354839
1054388,5,6305485550,"This is one of the most impressive DVD's We have.  I got it for free when I bought the ""Newsboys Shine: The Hits"".
It contains 15 songs including:
An alot better version of  ""I'm Not Ashamed"",
An also better version of  ""Spirit Thing"",
A funky(er) version of  ""Take Me To Your Leader"",
  ""WooHoo"", with a weird cartoon playing in the background,
The awesome hard rock song,  ""Cup O' Tea""
The hit song  ""Entertaining Angels""
The moving song  ""Always""
A cool vesion of  ""Reality"" (I like The Funky- town)
The neat, fun song  ""Truth Be Known""
Peter Furler And Duncun Phillips Get On The platform with drums that...well I'll let it be a surpise while they perform  ""Drum solo"" as bland as the
name is.
an extended version of  ""Breakfast""
Step right up and sing to  ""Step Up To The Microphone""
This Isn't the best song but its OK  ""Hallelujah""
The HUGE hit  ""Shine""
This is a fun DVD with jokes and lots of catchy tunes.  I recommend this to anyone, whether you've been a long Newboys fan or not, you MUST get this DVD.  If you don't have a DVD player then get it on VHS. You MUST have it.",987897600,15,1084,4.335
1054389,5,6305485550,This video is awesome! If you haven't seen this yet you need to! It captures all the energy and excitment of a real concert. Peter Furler's words at the end are awesome and heart touching.  Please watch this !,975110400,2,209,4.358974358974359

7892355,1,6305485550,"Video is OK, though sometimes it looks pixelated and others not clear, plus editing with cuts every 3 seconds is not that great; but audio is really bad, I couldn't understand almost any single word Peter was singing because all that I got was music,and not even well equalized. And is not my system, every other DVD sound fine, it is just that is really bad edited, like they recorded the sound from what was being heard at the moment through the speakers and not through the system.

I really couldn't watch it for too long.

Too bad, it seemed like a good concert.",1378425600,,567,4.4423076923076925

7892357,5,6305485550,The Newsboys are my favorite band so anything of them in concert I will recommend.  You won't be disappointed seeing them in concert with Peter Furler in the lead vocals.  Great songs and great band!!!,1356566400,,201,4.714285714285714
7892358,3,6305485550,"They played all the songs I would have expected as of 2001.  I was a little put off by the video itself.  Some scenes were fuzzy and cloudy (by design I believe), plus some odd ""effects"" were disappointing, like the TV screen with cartoon characters.

Also, why would they have their own music videos playing (of the song they were playing) behind them on a big screen, when they themselves are performing live?  Very odd.  My daughter mentioned how the lead singer looked ""freaky"".  I agree with what looked like black eye mascara or something around his eyes, she also said (and I agree) he looked better with his hat on because the dark around his eyes wasn't as obvious.

Finally, the audio wasn't great either, lyrics were difficult to make out most of the time, if I didn't know the words to the songs I wouldn't have known what they were singing.

""Not Ashamed"", ""Shine"", and ""Entertaining Angels"" were the highlights for me, although the rest of their set was well done.",1268956800,,978,4.61271676300578
7892359,5,6305485550,"This is actually a full length Step Up to the Microphone concert! You also get a few music videos! It is amazing! If you have never been to a real newsboys concert, go to a real concert before watching this, because if you watch this first, you will be dying to go to the real show! It's that good!",1255046400,4,298,4.067796610169491
