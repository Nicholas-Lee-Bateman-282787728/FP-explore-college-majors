2885998,5,B000SK5YZI,"I have to say it.  I loved and still love She-Ra and He-man.  I always wanted to see all the episodes and after so many years my dream has finally come true.  Ever since I was a little girl She-Ra has always been my favorite character.  What is also amazing is how everyone I know still
remembers and love these cartoons!

BCI has done such an amazing job and I want to congratulate them for the DVD collection and thanks to Filmation for such a wonderful cartoon.

It is a shame it did not last longer.  I was reading on He-man.org about She-Ra and there is a lot of series information that is very interesting.  Also there are plenty of She-Ra story premises by Robert Lamb that sounded so interesting and there are mentions by J. Michael Straczynski of several episodes that never went into production that would have also been great (especially one titled ""The Heart of Dark Hope"" where He-man and the Sorceress cross over to help Light Hope).
It also would have been great to see a movie crossover of She-Ra and He-man in Eternia defending Castle Grayskull and the Sorceress (the person to whom they owe so much) from Evil Forces.

Once again, I am so grateful to have the whole collection of She-Ra and He-man and I recommend it to those who used to enjoy it as young children and to those who want to show this generation what really good cartoons we used to watch with also good moral stories.  The extras are wonderful and the whole package is real nice.  You won't regret having them.

Let us remember our wonderful childhood with these cartoons as I am sure they are really going to bring back beautiful memories of us sitting in front of the t.v. or running back from school just waiting to turn the t.v. on to watch She-Ra and He-man. The power of Grayskull will live in my heart forever as in also many many other fans.",1190073600,7,1833,4.4226190476190474
2885999,5,B000SK5YZI,"All i can say about all 3 boxsets, is, they are amazing. They really put alot of effort into making these for the fans. Just the artwork is breathtaking. also the quality of the dvds is amazing as well. all in all thank you so much for bringing this fabulous series to dvd, finally!",1189641600,4,282,4.2407407407407405
2886000,5,B000SK5YZI,"This last volume of DVD's is as good as the previous two.  The artwork inside & out is great.  The episodes feature many new characters such as Peekablue (my favorite), Flutterina, Netossa, Spinnerella, Sweet Bee, and a very brief appearance by the Star sisters.  The Horde's new addition is Entrapta, seen in several episodes.  There are a few guest appearances by He-Han, Orko, & Man-At-Arms.
The special features include another short documentary on some of the artists' & directors' favorite episodes.  There are profiles on each of the new characters seen in the episodes, an image gallery of promotional pictures for The Secret Of The Sword, and a gallery of Horde character drawings.
The two new art cards are extremely well done, though I'm disappointed that some of my favorite characters have been left out of the series.
I'm so glad to finally have the entire series.  It was an important part of my childhood and I wish that the series could have lasted just a bit longer.",1189209600,3,984,4.8273809523809526

2886002,5,B000SK5YZI,"Get these while you can because, like the previous reviewer mentioned, there's a good chance She-Ra's DVD sets could go out-of-print like Jem and the Holograms.  We're extremely lucky to have gotten the complete series.  Apparently the She-Ra sets haven't sold nearly as well as He-Man.  And from what I understand, the sales on the Season 1 Volume 2 box set were somewhat disappointing, to the point where BCI Eclipse had to lower the recommended price a full ten dollars on this one.",1188604800,4,485,4.819277108433735
2886003,5,B000SK5YZI,Once fans own this third and final volume of She-Ra Princess of Power collections will be complete! BCI Ecplise has done a great job with getting these shows released and I have a feeling that once they lose the rights or even after a couple years these DVD sets will go out of print then eveyone will want them. Same thing happened with Jem and the Holograms released by Rhino years back now they are selling over $100.00 in some cases. If we are lucky Sony will hopefully release shows like G.I. and Jem and the Holograms that they own the rights to before fans of the show mainly early to late 30 year old that grew up with the shows will purchase them since that age group seems to be the buyers of these classic 80's animated shows.,1188345600,5,737,4.309352517985611
2886004,5,B000SK5YZI,"I grew up on She-Ra & He-Man, now my 4 year old daughter LOVES the cartoons and asks to watch them!!  I have Season 1 of She-Ra & Season 1 & 2 of He-Man.  She's even learning all the characters.  Sometimes she'd rather watch She-Ra than Dora (and that's saying ALOT)!!!  I love that now my daughter can enjoy the cartoons that I loved when I was young!!!",1186876800,4,354,4.161764705882353

What can I say of the DVD sets, simply they're piece of art that lovers of the MOTU ( Masters of the Universe) an POP ( Princesses Of Power) will enjoy as if they were kids once again.",1185753600,10,299,4.2631578947368425
2886007,5,B000SK5YZI,"Superfast delivery!!! I was so surprised, shocked even to see the package arrive so soon after I placed the order.

She-Ra is just as fun and great as He-man, the only negative thing I have to say is that the shows was canceled too early.
They could have done so much more fun stories and played with character development etc.
The supporting cast is so colorful and interesting it should have been given more time & space.
Oh well, I'm happy to complete my collection!",1290988800,3,469,4.517647058823529
2886008,3,B000SK5YZI,Purchased this for $62 off amazon.com  It is currently out of print so the price is skyrocketing. I love the show - but it came at a high price,1279929600,2,143,3.9310344827586206
2886009,5,B000SK5YZI,I'm so disappointed that i didn't catch the she-ra season boxsets when they were still in print so i could have bought them at a reasonable price! I mean i can still buy season 1 volumes 1 and 2 at decent prices but season 2 i can't find it nowhere under 40 bucks....people are selling it at 70 or more....I guess i'm gonna go ahead and purchase season 1 volumes 1 and 2 now and save up from check to check and buy season 2. This cartoon i gotta have. I bought he-man seasons 1 and 2 volumes 1 and 2 back when they were first released on dvd and i was so happy so i gotta have she-ra also! he-man and she-ra best 80s cartoons ever!!!,1275436800,,633,3.9921259842519685
2886010,4,B000SK5YZI,"So, out of all the 80's cartoon DVD sets that I've procured in the past 7 or so years I keep getting amazed by the ones that stand out as my favorites as far as content and presentation. I grew up addicted to shows like He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe, Transformers, the Silverhawks and Bravestarr for the most part; you know manly shows full of action and misfired lasers that never seemed to hit anything more important than rocks and the odd robot. There were a handful of shows that barely hit my radar like Robotech (too soap opera-y, you can see my thoughts on the show here), Jem (a guilty pleasure to be sure), and She-Ra Princess of Power, which just seemed like He-Man for girls.

When I sat down and started watching She-Ra recently, I was immediately struck by how wrong I was, and it's made for a lot of fun recent cartoon watching. If you haven't seen it, the show is a spin-off of He-Man that deals with the land of Etheria (which I think is actually a planet, though like Erternia in He-Man that's confounded me for years) and its inhabitants battling to get free of Hordak and his evil Horde (a mixture of He-Man-esque villains and stormtrooper-like robot things) who rule over the world. As you find out in the five-episode movie, the Secret of the Sword, which kicked off the first Vol. of DVDs (also available on the Best Of She-Ra set), one of Hordak's minions Adora (who was Captain of the Horde Troopers) is actually the long lost twin sister of Prince Adam, aka He-Man, who helps to free her of the magical hold that Hordak (via another minion Shadow Weaver) has on her. Adam brought a special sword (the Sword of Protection) for Adora, which like his Sword of Power has the ability with the power of Greyskull to transform her into the mighty She-Ra. Adora then bands together with a rag tag group of rebels to help build a rebellion against Hordak like so many Star Wars movie cliches.

This for me, is actually what sets She-Ra apart from He-Man and most of the cartoons of the 80's in that the heroes are coming from the losing side against an evil that has for all intents and purposes already succeeded in it's goal of world domination. Typically it's always the other way around in cartoons, so to have the balance of power shifted is pretty interesting. I also really dig the oppressing technology-minded world of the Horde, which is destroying all that's good and natural in Etheria. It ends up feeling very Matrix like in this respect. The landscapes and backgrounds are a hell of a lot more interesting with disturbing hidden words like 'obey' and 'evil' in the various bits of machinery and stuff. It makes for an over all darker show and the motivations of the characters end up being a little more relatable.

Of course being an 80's cartoon, the show does suffer from a ton of stereotypes. It's truly a mirror image of the He-Man cartoon with a cast of mostly female characters, Princess Glimmer, Queen Angella, Frosta and Madame Razz (who is the equivalent of Orko) and only one guy, Bow (the bizzaro version of Teela) as well as Spirit, Adora's horse who turns into Swift Wind the winged unicorn ala Cringer to Battle Cat when Adors becomes She-Ra. To sort of cement it as a ""girl's show"" there are some very Disney-esque talking animals/animated-inanimate objects with the addition of Kowl, a weird creature that's some sort of cross between an owl, a flying squirrel and a box of crayons as well as Broom, Madame Razz's sidekick that is what it's name suggests. The names of the places are all very ""girly"" as well, what with the Whispering Woods and the Crystal Castle (which has a gate keeper named Lighthope that's one of four people to know Adora's secret of being She-Ra (filled out by Kowl, Madame Razz & Broom.) Well I guess there are actually six people who know seeing as He-Man and the Sorceress also know. Damn it, there's also Sprit/Swift Wind, and I'm sure Cringer/Battle Cat, Man-At-Arms, and Orko all know seeing as Prince Adam confides in them as well. Fine, everybody probably knows. Secrets schmeecrets. Anyway, I think these 80's stereotypes actually help to accentuate the show from a nostalgia prospective.

The show has also been fun to watch for its variations on common 80's cartoon conventions, for instance the moral at the end of the show. In every episode of She-Ra there is a character named Loo-Kee (which I think is sort of named for Loki the Norse god of mischief) who is hiding somewhere in one of the backgrounds and at the end of the show he pops up to let you know where he was and to help you with the moral for the show. I thought was pretty ingenious as kids will be more likely to listen to what he's saying because they spent the last half hour subconsciously trying to find him. The Show is also a great example of how you don't need to stick to stereotypes to market a cartoon. Though it's obviously for girls, it's more or less a carbon copy of He-Man, which is stereotypically for boys and proves that both boys and girls can like the same things and don't have to be separated. It's surely a show that set up the groundwork for action shows like Justice League and Teen Titans that are marketed to both boys and girls.

I know I'm beginning to sound like a broken record with this, but once again this DVD set was released by BCI Eclipse, under their Ink & Paint division, which has done an amazing job with package and menu design, presentation of the content, not to mention a bunch of fun special features. There's a new installment of the behind the scenes documentary series by Andy Mangels, which ran through the entire He-Man series of DVDs and just as interesting and informative, as well as games, character profiles and some commentaries. All in all, with 33 episodes, the worthwhile extras, and the beautiful packaging, for around $30 you definitely get your money's worth with this set.",1245369600,,5904,4.5765595463138

2886012,5,B000SK5YZI,"This was great. It reminded me of when my boy was 2 and 3 years. He loved He-Man and She-Ra. It has understandable storyline, mild violence but not too harsh no one gets seriously hurt at least not beyond recovery and a moral lesson at the end presented in gentle often funny way. I highly recommend this for families with small children it has great cartoon hero/ role Models even parents appreciate. I'm in my mid 40s and still enjoy these cartoons.",1238112000,2,451,4.512195121951219

2886015,4,B000SK5YZI,"Seemingly no sooner than my sad goodbye to the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series, I've concluded my tour of the She-Ra Princess of Power DVDs last night. The second season of She-Ra represents the end of the Filmation run of the entire franchise and believe it or not; this shows through the quality of the story writing and even in the animation stock itself. He-Man and She-Ra always had a very distinctive look to them (even when compared against animation from other studios in that era) and the final season of She-Ra was no different except that the animators began tweaking the stock sequences to increase the degrees of facial expression and interaction. Arguably, this is perhaps the best-looking and most modern incarnation of the entire He-Man/ She-Ra universe to come out of Filmation.

Unlike He-Man, which ran for two full 65-episode seasons, She-Ra ran for a 65-episode debut season and a half package (28 episodes) for the second; which are all contained on this set. Unlike He-Man, which to me felt pretty tapped out in the end, She-Ra gives off the impression that the show was just getting started as the curtain closed in 1987. The show's creative staff simply created a world with so many unique characters that it certainly could have run for many more seasons without getting stale. Regretfully many story plots introduced in earlier episodes never find resolve before we say our final farewell. I personally would have liked a little more closure with Adora and Sea-Hawk's relationship. Likewise characters like Peekablue, Perfuma, Cast-A-Spella, Queen Angela, Light Hope, Frosta, etc. never feel fully fleshed out. Also oddly enough, the second season moves away from the secrets of Whispering Woods (and with that Madam Razz, Broom, the Twigets, etc.) and takes the viewer into much grander locales (including outer space several times).

At this point in time Larry DiTillio had left Filmation and Tom Tataranowicz had gone from storyboard artist to director. Because of these behind-the-scenes swaps, the show does have a unique feel to it. Perhaps this was also due in part to the reality that pumping out episodes had to have become a well-oiled-machine for the Filmation crew after 130 He-Man episodes, 65 She-Ras and a few animated feature films along the way.

Also worth mentioning is the fact that individuals wondering what else was popular at the time in animation need look no further than within the show itself as its guest appearances very closely mimic trends of the time. When transforming robots like Transformers and Go-Bots became the rage, She-Ra found herself battling the Monstroids. The Meteorbs and Dinosorbs bear an uncanny resemblance to the Lions from Voltron and the Bibbets are near clones of the short lived Paw Paws. Not to worry though, She-Ra never looses her way despite the outside influence.

The second season contains perhaps the greatest concentration of He-Man crossover episodes as well. While the creative staff accredits this to the endlessly fluctuating ratings game, I like to think that we as a society kind of missed He-Man (after all, at this point in the time the show had been laid to rest permanently) and his twin sister's program offered an opportunity to allow He-Man to live on if even only temporarily. Unlike the first season, I can honestly attest that his episodes were welcome here. It was a final opportunity to relive some of the magic of the show that started it all.

Included on this six-disc set are the following 28 She-Ra episodes:

One to Count On
Return Of The General
Out Of The Cocoon
A Lesson In Love
Something Old, Something New
Loo-Kee's Sweety
The Pearl
The Time Transformer
Above It All
Day Of The Flowers
Brigis
The Caregiver
When Whispering Woods Last Bloomed
Romeo And Glimmer
The Perils Of Peekablue
Just The Way You Are
The Locket
Shera Makes A Promise
Bow's Magical Gift
Sweet Bee's Home
Glimmer Come Home
The Inspector
Portrait of Doom
Hordak's Power Play
Shades Of Orko
Assault On The Hive
The Bibbet Story
Swifty's Baby

Like always, BCI pulls the stops when it comes to special features. This set includes two commentaries: On episode 83 ""She-Ra Makes A Promise"" with Tom Sito and Dori Littell-Herrick & on episode 85 ""Sweet Bee's Home. Both are hosted by Andy Mangels. The Stories of She-Ra, Princess of Power Part 3 Documentary with brand new Interviews with Producers, Writers, Directors and experts, specifically commenting on She-Ra's final adventures and the remarkable art of the series. DVD-ROM features 28 Scripts, Model Sheets ""Hordak & Villains"", Storyboard, and ""The Silaxian Wars"" the script and storyboards for the stunning She-Ra episode you never saw. Finally, included once again are 2 collectible 4""x 6"" She-Ra Princess of Power Art Cards this time by artists Leinil Francis Yu and Colleen Doran.

In conclusion it is sad to say goodbye to She-Ra Princess of Power but thanks to BCI, the show will live on indefinitely in a package worthy of the legacy itself.",1209945600,25,5004,4.970131421744325

2886031,5,B000SK5YZI,"From out of the past comes the thundering swords of She-ra, and He-Man.  With a cry of victory, and call to battle, they come to rescue the oppressed and seek justice!

Yeah, I know that's corny.  But, She-ra just makes me feel young again.  The 28 episodes on this set originally appeared from 1985 to 1987, officially culminating the Filmation/Mattel experiment.  What began as a simple vehicle to promote He-Man/She-Ra toys, became a popular show as it assumed a life of it's own and while the toys remain on collectors shelves, the TV shows rank high on `kids' minds.

Inkandpaintdvd has done a remarkable job on She-ra.  Instead of focusing directly on the episodes, like many re-releases do, they gear this set towards the geek/collector.  Not only are there 28 episodes, but also all 28 scripts, a comic book, coloring book, 2 art cards, a DVD-rom feature, and commentary on two episodes.  Those who relish a unified, neat looking DVD shelf, will appreciate the matching He-man spine image as well!  Even the discs have special character designs on them too. My sons enjoyed this show as much as I did.

Storywise, She-Ra and her magical allies in the Great Rebellion face their final struggles against the tyrannical Hordak and his Evil Horde. New warriors from the kingdom of Bright Moon appear to help stop the spread of oppressive villains making their debut in the Fright Zone. And in the battle against the malevolent forces of Horde Prime.  Some of my favorite episodes include `Something Old, Something New', `The Pearl', `The Time Transformer', and `Portrait of Doom'.  Excellent storytelling, and quality animation still are hallmarks of this classic series!

He-Man season 1 vol 1, He-Man season 1 vol 2, He-Man Season 2 vol 1, He-Man season 2 vol 2.
She-Ra had a 65 episode first season, also in vol 1-2, and a 28 episode 2nd season (this DVD volume being reviewed here). Watch for occasional guest appearances of He-Man, in the She-ra series. As long-time fans will know, He-Man and She-Ra are brother and sister, as explained in the first five episodes of She-ra season one volume 1.
The only other item to collect is ""He-Man and She-Ra: A christmas special"", in which the characters go to earth for christmas.

She-Ra is a great cartoon and BCI raised the standards for DVD releases, don't get me wrong, but the thing is these prices treat She-Ra's second season like its really rare and hard to find.  It isn't.  Classic Media re-released the entire series not long ago and the Classic Media sets are still in print.

""But James!"" you say, ""What if I want BCI's special features?""  Well, here's a little secret:  The Australian box sets of She-Ra: Princess of Power are exact duplicates of the BCI releases.  Same menus, same trivia, same special features, heck, even same disc artwork!  The only difference is having Madman's logo and ads for Madman DVDs in place of ""more from Ink and Paint"" on the bonus discs, and they include an EXTRA art card.  What's better is you can buy them either in four individual sets or as one ""Complete Series"" with different packaging.  The Complete Series doesn't have booklets or art cards, but its a nice way to get the entire show in one go, and runs about $100 last I checked.

Also, the episode ""Assault on the Hive"" has a glitch in BCI's set, but not in the other two.  So they're actually a little better.

The point is, you can get Season 2 of She-Ra lots of different ways, there is no reason at all that you should have to splurge on the out-of-print BCI set.  If you want just the episodes, Classic Media has you covered.  If you want the bonus features, Madman has you covered.  The only way I'd get the BCI set is if it came down in price.",1349568000,18,1848,4.411242603550296
