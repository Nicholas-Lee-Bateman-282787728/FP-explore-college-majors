8237303,2,B001068GHC,"I purchased this video a couple of years ago which has the tab for Rikki Don't Lose That Number. His tabliture is accurate in some cases but the solo fingerings are backwards as far as I can tell and not very accurate. The video demonstrates how he plays it yet the tab leaves a lot to be desired. I remember in the 80's accurate tab was available but not anymore, so buyer beware of this product. It seems that another one of his videos says it all with, ""Six String Conspiracy."" Oh by the way avoid all Warner Brothers and Hal Leonard guitar tab books as well because they are all inaccurate.",1368748800,,594,4.3125
8237304,5,B001068GHC,"I've had this video for a couple of years and I keep going back to learn new things.  Rick does some amazing things on the guitar and he breaks each part down into detailed description.  Some of the arrangements are very challenging (like Rikki Don't Lose that Number,) but they are worth pursuing.  There are also some such as 6-String Conspiracy which should be approachable from the intermediate level.

I think the think I like best about this DVD is that all of these songs have a cool groove to them.  It's not your typical acoustic guitar fare.  He does use some ver non-standard fingerings, but he explains this in the video and if it doesn't work for you, there are alternate fingerings you can use, but you'll have to figure them out for yourself.  The provided tab will help you there.

The video is about two hours long and packed with info.  It always cracks me up when a review gives something a bad rating because it's ""too hard.""  Just because you're not ready for it, does not make it a bad product.  This DVD is full of challenges.  Even if you don't master them all, you will learn a lot.",1333497600,,1107,4.425742574257426
8237305,1,B001068GHC,I bought this dvd and I am very disappointed.  I have been playing for a couple of years and this is for very advanced players.  The instruction is very limited and there is no menu. If you are beginner or intermediate this is not for you,1232409600,4,238,4.1521739130434785
8237306,5,B001068GHC,"This guy has flown under most peoples radar but he is an amazing player and teacher. I actually owned the VHS years ago and a book /CD version. I am happy to get the DVD. He is not a strict alternating thumb player which i like, not that he doesn't help you with that style as well.",1224288000,3,282,3.9649122807017543
