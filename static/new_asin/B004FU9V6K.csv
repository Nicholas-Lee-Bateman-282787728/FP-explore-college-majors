8428319,3,B004FU9V6K,"I absolutely fell in love with this when I watched the double length pilot episode back in 1985, but due to circumstances beyond my control, I never watched but one other episode.  Then it was cancelled, and I always wondered why, but since it was never released on DVD in the US, I couldn't watch it either to see what I thought of it or especially of the never aired in the US 16th episode.  However, since obtaining an all DVD, all Blu-ray player, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONY-SX910-Multi-System-Zone-All-Region-Free-DVD-Blu-Ray-Player-100-240V-50-60Hz-World-Wide-Voltage/dp/B00SHTYRCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONY SX910 Multi System Zone All Region Free DVD Blu-Ray Player - 100~240V 50/60Hz World Wide Voltage</a>, which I highly recommend by the way, I finally had what I needed to be able to purchase and play the PAL format DVD this TV series was only available on and to listen to the original English voice track.  Thus, I finally know why this series was cancelled...

because it deserved to be, and not just for the other problems I will mention.  The main reason I think it was cancelled (and the reason especially why the final episode was never aired in the US) was politics: it was just too lunatic leftist for its time.

Problem number one was its special effects; they were awful, and while that was largely a sad truth for TV shows made in 1985-1986, it really didn't help what was supposed to be a science fiction or fantasy show like this one.

Problem number two was the stars, or at least some of them.  Courteney Cox was absolutely brilliant in her part as Gloria Dinallo, a troubled telekinetic teen; you can literally see what would make her such a star in the future.  Mark Thomas Miller was also very good as Johnny (Johnny B) Bukowski, a somewhat aging R&R musician who was electrocuted on stage, which gave him formidable electrical powers.  However, things started to shrink with Kevin Peter Hall's (most famous as the stuntman who portrayed the Sasquatch Harry in ""Harry and the Hendersons"") role as Dr. Elvin (El) Lincoln, with the ability to shrink down to Barbie doll size, though that might be in part the fault of the show's writers who gave him a lot of recurring jokes in his role of straight man to the show's star.  The biggest character problem was with series star Dean Paul Martin's character Dr. Billy Hayes who was clearly intended to be the Bill Murray of the group, but Martin never really got a grasp of this character, always swinging wildly from sleazeball con artist to somewhat noble leader and never really nailing either end.

However, the biggest problem was the writing.  Clearly NBC was looking for a Ghostbusters style TV show; unfortunately the writers, or at least some of them, were determined to express their outrage over the election and reelection of Ronald Reagan, and while said writers were nowhere near as insane as the Hollywood types currently fulminating over the election of Donald Trump, they were insane...

and it showed.

An examination of the villains should suffice.  First, there was one and only episode directed against a Force of Nature, number 7, but that didn't stop the writer from condemning nuclear power generation (because it just happened to there) and making crude, stupid fun of the Governor of California, apparently a swipe at former California governor, then POTUS, Ronald Reagan.  Second, there were only 5 episodes involving realistic, not politically motivated, villains in the show:  number 6, against drug dealers; number 8, against international terrorists; number 11, against the Soviets (but a US official gets shown as almost working to help the Soviets, and the lead bad guy is made up to look like Richard Nixon and called out for it in case you missed it); number 12, against a mysterious international plotter; and number 15, against the Mob.  Third, there were 4 episodes directed against the main force of evil, in fiction as opposed to real life, business people: number 2; number 5 (which contains the only evil businessman with an excuse because the US government has cheated him out of a fortune, but since he is willing to kill people in order to get his money back, who cares); number 9 (which unintentionally hilariously contains a ludicrous plot about an oil company willing to kill people in order to bury a 300 mpg carburetor rather than, say, just SELLING it to customers and making far vaster sums of money); and number 13, against a crooked basketball team owner (and players!) betting against his own team.  Fourth, there was 1 episode directed against an even greater evil, defense contractors: number 10 (which contains the ""brilliant"" idea of secretly starting a plague which this company ""solves"" after enough people have died... in order to improve their image...).  Fifth, there were 4 episodes directed against the greatest evil of all, the US government: the pilot episode (which concerns a successful Star Wars, Cold War winning weapon,... which must be ""stopped""...); episode 3 (which involves for no discernible reason an ""intelligent"" ICBM); episode 4 (the only episode to indicate the military is inhabited by humans who have hearts... if no brains); and the never aired in America episode 16 (presumably never aired because President Ronald Reagan is shown as a criminal at the end, and NBC just wasn't willing to put up with that...  for such a low rated show).  The oddball is episode 14, a fairly clever way to show a bunch of clips from previous shows... along with a totally imaginary defense contractor that allows for more anti-nuclear weapons propaganda.

Too bad, it was just too lunatic lefty for its time some would say, but I'd say it was just too lunatic lefty period so unless you are a Trump-hater that desperate for ""good guys"" to cheer you up, be ye warned.",1521417600,,5872,4.998974358974359
