PLEASE understand that my following review is on THIELEMANN's Missa, NOT on Harnoncourt's. Do correct this silly mistake.
Dear readers, in lieu of a better solution, please scroll down for my thoughts on Nikolaus Harnoncourt's recording. Thank you.

Christian Thielemann has just given us his remarkable set of Beethoven symphonies on DVD. With his new orchestra, the Dresden Staatskapelle, a quartet of very good soloists and the outstanding Schsischer Staatsopernchor he now presents what I see as the logical and transcendental summation of all of Beethoven's works: the Missa Solemnis. The DVD competition is stiff. There is Bernstein's inimitable 1978 rendition in still acceptable sound and film, a very special interpretation by Michael Gielen (1986, nla), my long-time favorite, Sir Gilbert Levine's deeply felt and impressive reading and, finally, Fabio Luisi's recording (both 2005) with the same orchestral and choral forces as Thielemann's. The latter two certainly invite comparison: a comparison from which I'll refrain, because I can not quite warm up to Luisi's reading for purely subjective reasons. Thieleman and his excellent ensemble shine in every respect. Tempi are deliberate, as could be expected, but never drag. Despite the very large number of musicians in attendance, Thielemann keeps the sound stage as transparent and detailed as possible: this is one of his trademarks as a conductor. Without baton, he shapes every phrase, every motif to perfection, never losing his grip on the incredibly long thematic lines and on the whole beauty of this monumental edifice. I found myself spellbound by his moving interpretation, by the cohesion of everything and by his rapt attention to the score which totally involves all concerned as well as the listener. The uncompressed sound and the video are perfect. Get this and you will be elated. Now I wish, as a counterpoint, for a Missa from Paavo Jrvi and his Bremer Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie: if wishes were fishes...

Magnificent! Five stars

The following review deals with Nikolaus Harnoncourt's recording of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, NOT with Christian Thielemann's performance of the same work (please see my review there). Apparently there has been some confusion at Amazon about these two versions, and various comments - including the perceptive review by my much-esteemed fellow-reviewer Ian Giles -- have not been assigned properly.

We have been blessed in recent years with a slate of remarkable interpretations of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis on DVD, including Gilbert Levine's, Fabio Luisi's (both 2005), John Nelson's (2010) and Christian Thielemann's (2011) readings of what I dare consider - damn the torpedoes - the composer's greatest achievement. Direct comparisons of these readings are problematic, not only because the Missa appears to lend itself to a great variety of approaches in style and genre (as a mass, as a cantata, as a symphony with chorus and soloists, a deeply spiritual piece and/or a monumental, if unorthodox struggle with the transcendental), but also because of the very distinctive differences in the respective conductor's relationship to the score - differences which often become obvious already after several bars in the opening movement. These differences also may account, at least in part, for certain variances in the performances' tempi (total time Levine: 85 min., Luisi: 88 min., Nelson: 80 min., Thielemann: 90 min., Harnoncourt: 99 min.), however the ""objective"" timings can be quite deceptive: when listening to any given performance, the tempi regardless of their clock timings will sound ""right"" or ""wrong"" to you.

Harnoncourt's reading, presented in splendid Blu-ray video and audio, recorded live in Amsterdam's Concertgebouw during concerts in April 2012, is a case in point: though every individual movement is taken slightly slower than by Thielemann, the tempi feel perfect to me. Needless to say, the RCO musicians - in wisely somewhat reduced complement - play like archangels, and thanks to the recording and the collective level of excellence, every instrumental solo shines out. This transparency of orchestral textures is an essential part of the Missa's aesthetics too often sadly blotted out, especially in elephantine readings of past generations. The Netherlands Radio Choir (at home in Hilversum, if I remember correctly) is wonderful from beginning to end. Likewise, the vocal soloists are first-rate. They are placed behind the orchestra directly in front of the choir, presumably to avoid any showcasing or even the tiniest hint of an ""operatic"" illusion. If they seem a bit taxed on a few occasions, this is more than plausible considering Beethoven's merciless demands on his singers.

When I call this performance ""magnificent"" in this review's heading, it is in want of a better term: it is absolutely moving, spellbinding, enormously powerful in the more extraverted parts (Gloria; et resurrexit; the et vitam venturi fugue in the final pages of the Credo, the Hosanna) and deeply spiritual, infused with transcendental beauty in the more introspective passages. Concertmaster Liviu Prunaru (who is, to my dismay, not credited in the notes) gives a luminous, heavenly beautiful and, at the same time, unsentimental solo in the Benedictus. From the assertive, almost challenging Kyrie through the exuberant Gloria, the multi-faceted Credo, the festive Sanctus and tender Benedictus to the somber Agnus Dei - everything is done splendidly. Nikolaus Harnoncourt pauses and sits down for a few minutes both after the Gloria and the Credo, thus letting the music resonate in the ensuing silence. This is a very personal account of the Missa second to none. Enthusiastically recommended.",1300406400,19,5778,5.435897435897436
4396658,5,B004KDO2UM,"This joins the very select ranks of worthwhile performances of this mighty masterwork in the video medium.  The others are Herbert von Karajan's 1979 Salzburg Festival performance with the Berlin Philharmonic (where he finally got right so many things he did wrong in his four studio recordings); the newly released version with Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Concertgebouw (even better than this version, though the competition is close), and the 1993 performance with the Bavarian Radio Symphony under Sir Colin Davis (only issued on VHS to date). While in the past I have found Thielemann to be a very uneven conductor, here he is in top form, with four excellent soloists (a rarity in this work) and an equally fine orchestra and choir at his command.  If he is not particularly original or imaginative, he is secure and unidiosyncratic, and gets special credit for bringing off successfully the final pages of the Agnus Dei, a point at which so many performances fall flat.  Both the audio and visual recording are excellent.",1385510400,,1028,5.035294117647059
4396659,5,B004KDO2UM,"The Amazon reviews of this recording are a total mess because many of them refer to different recordings by different conductors.  I bought this Blu-ray because of a number of superlative reviews.  It is difficult to get Beethoven's Missa Solemnis precisely right and my favorite has always been Bernstein's recording, many years ago, also with the Concertgebouw.  This recording lives up to the stellar reviews.  If it were possible to give six stars I would not hesitate.  A transcendental recording.",1381104000,5,502,5.225
4396660,3,B004KDO2UM,"Most reviewers for this recording are highly laudatory and rapturous. I thoroughly enjoy Harnoncourt's Beethoven Symphonies.  Although this performance of the Missa is radiant and refined, it is astonishingly slow! The Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are each up to three minutes longer than performances by other noted conductors. The whiplash final bars of the Gloria and the Credo, in particular, are positively relaxing in this recording.  Did anyone else feel a tad disappointed here?",1381017600,,481,5.486486486486487
4396661,5,B004KDO2UM,"I was inspired to purchase this Blu-ray of the Missa Solemnis by Robert Levine's 10/10 review at Classics Today, and I was not disappointed.

Harnoncourt gives both clarity and coherence to this sprawling work.  As Levine says, ""The overall effect of the Missa under Harnoncourt is one of a ceremony, one in which there are emotional outbursts that nonetheless are part of the structure and fabric.""  The introverted sections are treated with the utmost tenderness, and the extroverted ones are bracing with no hint of bombast.

This disc is perfect in every respect.  The top-notch soloists (Marlis Petersen, Elisabeth Kulman, Werner Gura, and Gerald Finley) are well matched and work as part of the team.  The Netherlands Radio Choir is excellent.  The ambience and acoustics of Amsterdam's Concertgebouw are justifiably world renowned.  And the videography and recorded sound (contrary to another reviewer) leave nothing to be desired.

Heretofore, my Missa of choice has been James Levine's 1991 CD with the Vienna Philharmonic.  But from now on, when I want to listen to (and view) the Missa Solemnis, I will turn to Harnoncourt and the Concertgebouw.

Addendum (November 2013): This recording continues to astound and delight.  James Altena gives a highly favorable review in Fanfare (November/December 2013).  He praises Harnoncourt's ""extraordinary ability to to sustain dramatic tension at every moment, even during the most quiet and intimate passages"" and describes the vocal quartet as ""among the strongest ever assembled for a recording of this work.""",1378512000,11,1564,5.360655737704918
4396662,4,B004KDO2UM,"Amazon has made one holy mess of the listing here: First, most of the reviews here are not for the Harnoncourt, but rather the Thielemann, with one exception (as of this writing), by I. Giles that includes both. The star rating averages the reviews for the Thielemann and the Harnoncourt. Secondly, the language for the audio is listed as Greek--is this a joke? The Missa is in Latin, of course. I've submitted a change to Amazon, and I hope that this error will be corrected by the time most of you read this. Thirdly, no details are given regarding the audio format; unless one enlarges the image of the back cover, one would not be aware that the surround format is irregular: DTS-HD MA 5.0. (See below for the ramifications of this.)

In view of the above confusion, let me clarify that my comments are for the Harnoncourt Blu-ray. I won't add much to I. Giles's excellent review. I agree that this is a beautiful, nuanced reading, one that achieves passion without hysteria, striking a happy balance between frantic and sluggish. I grew up with the Bernstein audio recording with the New York Philharmonic, one that in retrospect falls into the hysterical, frantic category; but I love it; and for better or worse it makes all others, including this one, seem somewhat dull to me.

Warning: no subwoofer track! Why does Unitel keep doing this?!! Why, especially in view of the fact that the DVD issue has it? As this 5.0 format is virtually unknown on other labels (I have a DG in the same format, but it was licensed from Unitel), the prospective buyer would be unlikely even to think about checking this spec. 5.0 means that on some home-theater systems there will be very anemic bass--only what the satellite speakers can deliver. It depends upon several factors, such as whether or not one's A/V receiver has the ability to synthesize a sub-woofer channel in the absence of a real one, and whether one uses digital or analog outputs from the Blu-ray player. Those who have sufficient flexibility in their audio setups to deal with 5.0 surround can safely order this disc and make whatever adjustments are necessary when playing. Those with full-frequency front left and right speakers won't have a problem either. But everybody else is out of luck--no bass!",1377043200,4,2266,4.778061224489796

.....................................

Beethoven wrote this work in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars which affected Beethoven deeply. In 1823 he invited various European royal houses to subscribe to a printed edition of his Mass which is how a copy of the work with Beethoven's own autograph annotations has become a part of the holdings of the Saxon State and University library.

Every year on February 13th there is a commemorative concert held in Dresden to commemorate the destruction of Dresden towards the end of World War 2. In this case the concert also commemorated the 25th anniversary of the rebuilding of the opera house. These concerts always feature a requiem and end with a minute's silence without any applause. This end to the performance is included in this 2010 recording and is, in itself, a deeply moving conclusion.

The performance is very fine indeed and rises impressively to all climatic moments with a finely matched quartet of four star singers, committed singing from the choir and immaculate playing from the orchestra under the direction of Thielemann. The long solo violin obligato part throughout the Benedictus is particularly beautifully played by the leader, Matthias Wollong, and the Agnus Dei concludes the work with Beethoven's strong ' plea for inner and outer peace' making the strongest impact imaginable.

This is not a joyful occasion but it is a moving one. The camera work is suitably sensitive whilst being finely detailed and the sound is provided in both DTS-HD and stereo and is of the high quality that one knows now to expect from C Major.

This is a very fine recording and performance of this work and deserves to be considered seriously by purchasers interested in a high quality visual and sonic presentation of this work. This will particularly be so if they also respond to the connection being made between the work and the reason for its performance at Dresden on this occasion.

4396665,2,B004KDO2UM,"This review pertains to the Blueray recording by the Staatskappelle of Dresden, conducted by Christian Thielemann. What a great disappointment!!!!  A monumental choral work is made anemic by a faulty sound track. The chorus and male soloists sound distant from the  dominating sound of the orchestra. When the soloists sing in quartet, the male voices, especially the bass, are almost overpowered by the soprano and alto; not that the men don't have powerful voices. It is due to poor sound engineering. On blu-ray, the visual is sharp in detail. If only the sound were!!!!",1336521600,6,573,5.085106382978723

4396667,5,B004KDO2UM,"I am not a big fan of films of concerts, opera being a different kettle of fish.  I certainly don't buy dvds of symphonic concerts but when a large chorus is involved in a major mass with a great orchestra, soloists and conductor I will usually buy it, but I am very selective.  How many films of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis do I need?  Well, as it turns out two.

From having zero dvds of this piece I ordered the Thielemann concert in a beautiful concert hall from 2010 and the Fabio Luisi one from 2005 filmed at the official opening in the Frauenkirche in Dresden.

Oddly the one from the Frauenkirche is the most authentic concert of the two because it includes applause, and the one from the concert hall is very solemn, slightly pretentious in this regard, and ends with the audience standing silently in homage to the fire bombing of Dresden during WW2.  The Frauenkirche might have been the more appropriate place for such reverence.

But there is nothing to complain about in the camera work in either 2005 or 2010.  The Unitel from 2010 with Thielemann is fascinating to watch.  It is mind-boggling to imagine the coordination of the film team to manage so many cuts and angles and close-ups in a live event without a single camera ever being visible on screen.  The work for Luisi's version is equally flawless and beautiful.  Thielemann's  concert hall is very classical and elegant, Luisi's Frauenkirche setting is joyously baroque and heavenly to behold..  So these two films are quite different and compliment one another very nicely.

Thielemann and Luisi are two of the greatest conductors out there right now.  Thielemann eschews baton and score and stands there uninhibited by any incumbrance.  His masterful knowledge of the score is evident before the music begins.  Luisi uses a score and baton and jumps about a little.  This is apt in his performance which seems more in tune with the fundamental joy of this piece.

Their interpretations are contrasted, one may go a little quicker than the other here and there but both interpretations are beautiful, solemn when called for and full of energy and panache at times.  The orchestra and choral personnel seem quite different between '06 and '10.  The two teams of vocal soloists are both very fine. I prefer, slightly, Luisi's with a fuller soprano and more audible (as recorded) bass.  Luisi has two beautiful female soloists, and I don't mean just their voices.  Camilla Nylund and Birgit Remmert are splendid and are superbly partnered by Christian Elsner, tenor and Ren Pape who needs no introduction.  Thielemann's team is made up of Krassimira Stoyanova, Elina Garana, Michael Schade and Franz-Josef Selig.  All eight of these singers have beautiful, well-trained and controlled voices.  If there is an award for the greatest singing of the eight it would go to Elina Garana's extraordinary singing.
She is a young Christa Ludwig and I would expect her to start showing up in Wagner soon, Brangne, Fricka and Waltraute.

I am happy to have purchased both these films.  If you want a Missa Solemnis that is indeed solemn then go for the glorious Thielemann, which is also full of spirit and is life enhancing, if perhaps taking itself too seriously.  If you want a more joyous approach, which is also solemn when called for, and has a more natural atmosphere in the extraordinarily beautiful Dresden Frauenkirche, then don't hesitate to buy the Luisi.

Frankly I think I will be turning to the Luisi more than the Thielemann in the future.",1304899200,19,3517,4.852348993288591

8432850,4,B004KDO2UM,"On Feb. 13, 2010, Christian Thielemann conducted this performance of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis at the Semperoper in Dresden to mark the 65th anniversary of the destruction of the opera house in 1945 and the deaths of thousands of men, women, and children -- noncombatants -- who were lost in the Allied firebombing of the city that began on that day. The concert also coincided with the 25th anniversary of the Semperoper's reopening. International dignitaries in attendance included Mikhail Gorbachev (on whom the camera rests for a few moments as the orchestra tunes up), who had led the way to German reunification and who was honored the next day with the Dresden Peace Prize. Heightening the stakes of the event, Thielemann was stepping onto this worldwide platform after having just been elected as the Staatskapelle's new principal conductor. Massive choral and instrumental forces were assembled, including four of the world's outstanding soloists -- soprano Krassimira Stoyanova, mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca, tenor Michael Schade, and bass Franz-Josef Selig.

It was, indeed, no ordinary occasion. It was observed with no ordinary performance, which was met with no ordinary reaction from the assembled audience. Fortunately, the proceedings were recorded by Unitel Classica and issued in 2011 on this Blu-ray by C Major.

Thielemann presided over this monumental Beethoven composition -- which, fittingly for the occasion, prophesies the dangers of wars to come -- with impressive composure, conducting with no score, no baton, calling no attention to himself. And when the massive work had shaken the heavens and plumbed the soul, the subdued finale, the Agnus Dei, solemnly pleads, ""Have mercy on us."" It's not the blazing, triumphal ending of the Ninth Symphony. Beethoven's different goal in the Missa perhaps accounts for its not being as popular or as widely recognized as the masterpiece it is. The martial sounds that intrude are disquieting, make us look over our shoulder, remind us that the peace of the Benedictus is a fragile thing, continually threatened by the chaotic, outside world -- as it was during World War II and as it continues to be in the 21st century.

The work's fading into a troubled sleep at the close often leaves listeners uncertain how to respond. In Dresden, on this day, the most remarkable thing happened. When the Missa arrived at its destined end, the members of the audience, silently, with no applause, began rising to their feet until every single person in the entire house, including those in the orchestra and choir, were standing -- and remained so, in solemn acknowledgement, with a motionless Thielemann continuing to face the orchestra. After several minutes, the audience gradually, in unspoken agreement, began filing out of the hall, individuals exchanging not a word, lost in their own meditations. It's the most moving tribute to a concert performance I've ever seen. Each time I watch it, or even think about it, I feel the emotions rise up. This audience knew how to pay tribute to Beethoven's massive edifice -- and take its warning to heart.

Besides Thielemann, concertmaster Matthias Wollong deserves to be singled out for praise. After having listened to Klemperer's EMI LP and CD for decades, I thought I would never hear another violin so perfectly float down its angelic blessings on the world at the beginning of the Benedictus. I was wrong. Among the soloists, Garanca is especially impressive. If her intoning ""Benedictus"" following the violin solo doesn't melt your heart, you don't have one. Ironically, but perhaps appropriately for this most sacred of secular pieces or most secular of sacred pieces, Garanca looks more enticing in the severity of a black gown than she does parading as Carmen with the Met.

Unfortunately for this moving and beautifully filmed performance, the sound engineers have favored the sopranos and shortchanged the basses. Perhaps that's why bass soloist Selig is often inaudible, even when the camera focuses on him. Amazon's catalog contains other worthy DVDs and Blu-rays of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. But despite the slight imbalance in the audio track, there's not another like this one.",1407888000,8,4202,5.2192592592592595
8432851,5,B004KDO2UM,"As an experienced choral singer and director, I must say that the ""MIssa Solemnis"" is the most physically demanding choral work I have sung, both under George Szell and Robert Shaw, but it was a fascinating challenge and experience.

This excellent performance by the Royal Concertgebouw under Nicolas Harnoncourt was both visually and aurally satisfying in its BluRay format, and I enjoyed the musicianship of the chorus and the soloists.  Maestro Harnoncourt did not conduct with as much passion as I expected, but that did not detract from the performance, and the forces obviously have great love and respect for him.

My personal preference would be for a somewhat larger choral group, as some of the most powerful choral sections were a little over-balanced by the demands of Beethoven's orchestra. However, this is by far the best DVD experience I have had with the Missa Solemnis.",1390176000,4,888,5.068493150684931
8432852,4,B004KDO2UM,"I particularly enjoy this work of art, which I regard as the most intense, in many dimensions, and the most inaccessible when it comes to understanding a piece of music.  This is the longest non-assembled and non-staged work of music, perhaps, the most demanding of them all; and most likely, the most difficult to perform in its original conception (if anybody really dares to assert that knowledge).  I own all the versions on CD that have become available to me, as well as all the video-recordings I have known of (except for the 2 video recordings by Sir Colin Davis, one shown in EWTN's 'In Concert', and a more recent one that can be viewed on YouTube), and I have pursued multiple live performances.  There is always something missing when the Missa is performed, and it really becomes more a personal notion for the avid follower and fan of this work, rather than a piece of music that can be heard perfectly played.  Harnoncourt's performance, although not perfect, did some justice to Beethoven's Missa Solemnis.  I must admit that he offered a crisp, organized and meticulous, yet passionate version of the Missa, while attempting to be faithful to the Austrian Mass tradition.  I don't think I can blame him for some of the performance flaws; as Robert Shaw once said, ""the impossibility of performing the Missa Solemnis, is what the Missa Solemnis is all about"".",1386633600,2,1376,4.834042553191489
