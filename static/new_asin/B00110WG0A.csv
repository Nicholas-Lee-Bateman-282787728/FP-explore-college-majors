8239724,4,B00110WG0A,"Let me preface this by pointing out that this is a very low budget independent film. If you are expecting a ""Hollywood Lite"" type of a movie, this is not it. One way to describe it is as an experimental movie version of a docudrama. The story takes place on a single Saturday, and it is shot handheld with a single camera. This should help set expectations.

The story follows a number of ""Smokers"" as their lives get interconnected and intertwined on a single day. The setting is New York. In some instances, the dialog is hard to figure out, as it gets overpowered by the background noise. There is no close-captioning as far as I can tell. The movie is not afraid to use split screens, which actually works, especially considering this is an experimental type of a movie, not a Hollywood blockbuster created to spoon-feed the masses. For the more advanced members of the audience, the movie offers subtle social commentary on this subject.

The DVD includes the movie, along with an audio commentary track with the actors and creators of the movie, and a 30-minute ""Making Of"" video with the actors and creators. The ""Making Of"" is a great compliment to the movie (watch it after watching the movie since it has mega-spoilers) as we get an inside look on how it all came together.

As to whether you should buy it or not, you can always watch the movie through the DVD/video rental services (at least one of them has it), and then decide for yourself.

If the directors names or voices sound familiar to hardcore LOST fans, it is with good reason - the two creators of this movie, W. Axel Foley and Mike Hull were hosting the ""Lost Mythos TheoryCast"" podcast.",1280620800,,1662,4.585858585858586
8239725,5,B00110WG0A,"Charles Goonan is in this movie.  Only one scene though, so, if there is a way to fast forward or skip the chapters to just get to the scene where he shows up, do it, because Goonan is sexy!  And word around town is he's a genius.",1265932800,,230,3.872340425531915
8239726,1,B00110WG0A,"I bought this movie with high expectations, because I happen to know one of the actors, and also the director. While both are certainly nice people in life, I can't extend the same feelings towards this movie.
The basic idea of the story could have been viable, had it been developed differently and more in depth. The introduction of the characters takes forever, which makes me feel as if they either were full of dope when they did this, or they assume the viewer is dumb and won't get it fast. Not much character depth either, just that they are all dealing. The director also uses very annoying split screens, so you see 4 different images, which more often than not show the same scene from 2 or even 4 different angles. What that is supposed to be good for, I can't figure out. I don't see why we have to watch the one guy on the phone at the bar inside while on the other screen, we see the second guy sitting in a patio chair doing nothing. We don't learn much from the one-sided phone conversation, and not a thing from the guy just sitting outside. And this is basically a repeat situation: shots of identical scenes from different angles throughout the entire film. Then the music: totally incoherent. It wildly swings from rap to classical instrumentation. Not to mention that the music is so loud that one can hardly follow the supposedly funny and whitty dialogue, which drowns itself in background noise and overlaying music.
Also, there is no supporting evidence that the character of one of the dealers would be a killer at all, nothing shows that he could even remotely hold a gun and kill somebody, or really have a compelling situation that might lead him to such an act. He plays this rather cool dealer, who seems to possess a tad of philosophy, albeit tinted with sarcasm. He comes through as almost ""nice"", then turns into a cold-blooded robber and killer just like that. It is a complete break of identity and I can't buy it!
And I also wished I had not bought this video, a total waste of my money, except to use it as a very good study as to what all can be done wrong in movie making.
So I guess I'll keep it for that purpose... unless I could find somebody who'd want to take it off my hands? It will disappear in the drawer containing the ""movie errors"" never to come out again!",1214265600,,2309,4.435294117647059
8239727,5,B00110WG0A,"I got it from Netflix today and watched it. I don't know if I'm going to buy it from this website, but I did like the movie.

It's independent, so I wasn't familiar with any of the actors. Most of them were good, even though a few of the people looked more like actual drug users than actors. They might have been.

It was cool to see parts of New York that don't usually get in movies. Some of the lines were funny, especially the character Indo. I liked the music A LOT.

It's not perfect, but I was entertained and the end was really exciting. That's what I want out of an independent movie and I got it.",1206489600,2,607,4.084033613445378
8239728,5,B00110WG0A,"Smokers is a wild ride through split screens and weed smoke. The style is unique, the acting sharp and the dialogue is quick and funny. This fast- paced film tells a familiar story of a fish out of water- in this case, Kansas native Aaron, alone in the big city. Through intertwining narratives we met Carlos, Indo, Bill and Paula, all drug dealers of different level and caliber. You've got to watch to see what happens. This movie makes 93 minutes feel more like 15, as it starts and never slows down.",1201046400,4,503,4.478260869565218
