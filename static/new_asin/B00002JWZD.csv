7915829,2,B00002JWZD,"In one of his last movies released as of this writing, lesser-known action hero David Bradley teamed with sci-fi aficionado Philip Roth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apex/dp/6303082718/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apex</a>) to create an ultimately disappointing time travel adventure. Total Reality is highlighted by occasional flair in the effects and drama departments, but this far from compensates for its bland characters and mediocre action content.

The story: A soldier from the future (Bradley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Justice/dp/6303945708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Justice</a>) leads a team of convicts in a suicide mission to 1998 to stop a deadly separatist (Thomas Kretschmann,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-II/dp/B00005JKWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade II</a>) from changing history.

The movie begins and ends with a bang, showcasing some exciting CG-driven space scenes with graphics that are pretty impressive for a low-budget film from the mid-90s. However, this seems to demonstrate where the majority of the budget has gone: while the contemporary-set scenes do well, the sets for spaceship interiors and the like are far from convincing.  I also don't buy the placement of the dramatic scenes: there are a couple of genuinely well-acted exchanges late in the movie, but they arrive too late to generate much interest in the largely mundane personas, and would have been better placed earlier in the production. David Bradley gives one of the better performances of his career and Thomas Kretschmann is the closest thing the film has to genuine dramatic clout, but for the most part, they are not doing or saying much of genuine interest.

Action-wise, shootouts are the name of the game, but to be honest, there definitely aren't enough adrenaline scenes for a movie like this. David the martial artist gets one fight scene, but otherwise, he and the remaining cast engage in a handful of slow-motioned unexciting gunfights wherein taking cover is completely optional. There really is not much in the way of excitement with this one.

Almost twenty years after the release of Total Reality, Im still disappointed that David Bradleys film career ended, but if this is what directly precluded it, I cannot blame whoever made the final decision. No one ought use this film to introduce themselves to either the actor or the director, and would do well to avoid it in general.",1439424000,,2550,5.975342465753425
7915830,1,B00002JWZD,"This truly and utterly stinks. Awful acting (I thought Keanu Reeves was wooden, but this is a whole forest of Z-list actors), abysmal plot (not only could this atrocity be written on a beer-mat, but you'd have space to write two more of these stinkers in the space left over).
Avoid!",1009929600,6,283,4.568627450980392
7915831,2,B00002JWZD,"I think that most sci-fi fans would enjoy this film but in comparison to some of the TV shows we now have, the graphics really don't stand up.  No, effects aren't everything but they help.

The plot is really very interesting - a guy writes a book and everything gets totally out of hand.  Thousands are corrupted by the book and live their lives through its teaching - but this  brings about a war and chaos ensues.  Our heros get sent back in time to stop some baddies who've also escaped back to 1998.  That's the gist of it anyway.
So, we've got a good overall plot, but there is a LOT of inconsistency - one woman's hair changes dramatically from scene to scene, so my family were all laughing at the supposedly touching parts of the flick.  Watch out for some stupid lines, such as ""Take us to your computer"", which I don't think they even meant to be funny!
Overall, I didn't mind the film.  The best thing about it was probably that it made me laugh even though it really isn't a comedy.  It was a good idea which fell flat on it's face but I could just about cope with it.  There is also not any extra material with the DVD except a trailer, which was a little annoying - when you buy a DVD you expect something more than a video and I didn't think it offered much in that respect.
The very worst thing about this film is all the swearing in it.  At one point, a guy just swears a whole sentence out and you had to laugh because it was so ridiculous.  That was the only time the swearing was remotely funny.  It was uneccesary and didn't add anything to the film - it just got really annoying!  Even if you don't mind swearing, I think it would begin to grate on your nerves eventually.
So, the verdict: You decide, it's low budget but good for a laugh, especially if you're a sci-fi fan, however the bad effects, bad lines and constant swearing could put many people off.",1009670400,9,1881,4.247191011235955
7915832,2,B00002JWZD,The first 30 minutes of Total Reality are great.  Big spaceships thunder across the screen (and your speakers) whilst being attacked by lots of smaller ones.  In the meantime an attack force boards one of the biggies  and lots of shooting occurs whilst the battle rages outside.  It's great  stuff and gets your adrenalin going.  But it's a real shame the film didn't  hold my interest afterwards.  The goodies are forced to go back in time to  track down the baddies who also went back in time.  Some quite exciting set  pieces (with big explosions) keep the excitement going but then melodrama  and some pretty poor acting start to take their toll.  I know this isn't a  mega-budget film but you don't need big bucks to keep the pace going.  The  film slowly starts to run out of steam.  What a shame.  But it's definitely  worth seeing if you like space battles and there is another BIG spaceship  at the end.,959990400,16,912,4.546583850931677
